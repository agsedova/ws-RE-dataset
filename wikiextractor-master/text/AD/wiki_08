It had a unique design of boiler and a number of other novel design features (perhaps explaining the choice of name). Unfortunately, several of the major components had significant design weaknesses which ultimately resulted in its failure at the Trials.\n\nDuring the late 1820s Ericsson and Braithwaite were working together building horse drawn fire engines with steam pumps. These used a boiler designed by Ericsson and were built in the London works of John Braithwaite.\n\nThese fire engines were known for their ability to raise steam quickly and looked very similar to \"Novelty\".\n\nCharles Vignoles has also been associated with \"Novelty\", but his practical involvement is not known. He may have aligned himself with the engine because of a continuing feud with George Stephenson.\n\nIt is said that Ericsson and Braithwaite only found out about the Rainhill Trials seven weeks before the event was due to take place, when Ericsson received a letter from a friend referring to a \"Steam Race\". This incredibly short space of time has led people to suggest that \"Novelty\" is in fact a converted fire engine. It is more likely that it used many of the same parts as their fire engines and these parts may even have been built for an existing order and diverted to \"Novelty\".\n\n\"Novelty\" was constructed in the London Workshop belonging to Braithwaite and transported to Liverpool by boat. There was no time to test \"Novelty\" in London before transportation, and following test runs at Rainhill before the trials, modifications were carried out with the help of Timothy Hackworth.\n\nThe boiler used on \"Novelty\" was designed by John Ericsson. The design was very scientific for the era but proved to be very hard to build and maintain compared with the boiler design adopted for \"Rocket\" and most steam locomotives since.\n\nThe most prominent feature for the boiler is the vertical copper firebox (the large vessel to the right in the illustration here). Within the vertical vessel was the inner firebox and the space between the two was filled with water (to a level just about the same as the driver’s ankle). (Coke) fuel was added from the top, where a tube passed down through the top of the firebox. This firebox construction was not dissimilar to some types of vertical boiler, but this was only part of Ericsson’s design.\n\nLike George Stephenson, Ericsson understood that a large area was needed to extract heat from the hot gases. This he did in a long horizontal tube filled with water which ran under the full length of the engine. It can be seen in the illustration on top of this page, sticking out to the right, with the vertical chimney attached to it. Within the horizontal section was a tube carrying the hot gases, this formed an ‘S’ shape so the gases made three passes through the water. This ‘S’ shaped tube was also tapered causing the gases to speed up as they cooled down. In practice this tube is almost impossible to clean.\n\nThe resulting boiler was the shape of a hammer and was required to be fitted to the frame before the footplate, cylinders or blower could be added.\n\nThe boiler used a ‘Forced Draught’ provided by a mechanical blower (the triangular structure on the right in the illustration). This forced air along a pipe and into the sealed ashpan (below the fire). Very few steam locomotives have ever used a forced draught like this, the main reason is that in order to add fuel either the draft must be stopped or some form of airlock fitted. \"Novelty\" used an airlock to feed the fuel in, but there was still a chance of flame and hot gases being blown into the face of the fireman.\n\nThe blower was driven from the rods linking the cylinders to the wheels, thus the draught was proportional to the speed of the engine, not to how hard it is working as with a blastpipe. It is assumed that either the blower was worked by hand when the engine was standing or the drive wheels were lifted off the rails. Details of the blower design are not known for certain.\n\nWater was forced into the boiler using a pump driven off one of the cylinders (this was normal practice at the time).\n\nAt this time, engineers were worried about uneven wear on pistons and cylinders when they were mounted horizontally, so most were mounted vertically, but vertical cylinders driving directly on the wheels (as on \"Sans Pareil\") caused problems with poor riding and did not work well with the springs.\nOn \"Novelty\", the cylinders were mounted vertically towards the rear of the engine (to the right of the men in the illustration). Directly below were bell cranks which changed the drive to horizontal. Connecting rods linked the bell cranks to the crank axle (the axle on the left in the illustration).\n\nThe valve gear took a similar route to the drive. One effect of this was it had many pins and links, resulting in lost motion.\n\nThe wheels themselves were of the suspension type (similar to a bicycle wheel).\n\nIt is easy to think that \"Novelty\" is an 0-4-0 locomotive as it had equal sized wheels, however is actually an 0-2-2WT. Only the wheels under the firebox (those to the left on the illustration here) were driven, the other wheels were not normally connected to the drive, although they could be coupled by a chain 'when necessary'.\n\n\"Novelty\" was the first tank locomotive as it carried its water in a well tank between its wheels.\n\nAs one of the rules for the Rainhill Trials related to the weight of the engine without a tender, a special allowance had to be made for \"Novelty\".\n\n\"Novelty\" was the crowd’s favourite to win the Trials. This may be because it looked like a steam carriage (which people associated with speed and improvements in transport) or it may be because it did not look like a typical colliery engine of the time. In the demonstration runs that took place on the first day of the trials, \"Novelty\" did not disappoint, managing a speed of around \n\nIn the preparations for the trials, \"Novelty\" was shown to be very lightweight and very quick to raise steam.\n\n\"Novelty\" was the first locomotive to be tested. Starting on the second day of the trials, it began the planned series of runs but very quickly the blower failed and repairs had to be made. The repairs took up all of the next day. However, when \"Novelty\" next ran the water feed pipe burst and more repairs had to be made, which seem to have included a seal on the boiler. At the time, the boilers were sealed with a cement-like substance which required days - if not weeks - to set properly. Time would not allow this and the seal quickly failed once the trial runs were restarted.\n\nThe recurring boiler problems prompted Ericsson and Braithwaite to withdraw from the Trials.\n\nBefore it failed, the Stephensons were said to be seriously worried by \"Novelty\", as it was well-suited to meet the conditions of the trial. For one thing the Stephensons considered the weight to be pulled to be too light for a practical railway.\n\nOnce all the repairs were completed, \"Novelty\" made a number of successful demonstration runs but it was too late to have any effect on the competition. It is sometimes claimed that one of these demonstration runs included the locomotive reaching a speed of , but there is little to back this up and it may be a misinterpretation of a newspaper report trying to give an impression of the great speeds that the Rainhill engines were achieving.\n\nTwo further engines were built by Ericsson and Braithwaite named \"William IV\" and \"Queen Adelaide\". These were generally larger and more robust than \"Novelty\" and differed in a number of details (for example, it is thought that a different design of blower was used which was an ‘Induced Draught’ type, sucking the gases from the fire). The pair ran trials on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway but the railway declined to purchase the new designs.\n\n\"Novelty\" was transferred to the St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway and worked there for a few years. During its time there (around 1833) it received new cylinders and a new boiler.\n\nSomehow, all the wheels and both cylinders (assumed to be the original one not those from the 1833 rebuild) survived.\n\nDuring 1929 the original wheels and one cylinder were incorporated into a full scale, non-working model that is now on display in the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry. This early replica was rebuilt in 1988 and currently includes batteries and an electric motor to allow it to move (all wheels are driven making the engine a 4wBE), although the steam components are non-functional. The other cylinder is on display at Rainhill Public Library.\n\nNo other British locomotives are known to have been built in this style. Comparisons are made with 20th-century vertical-boilered engines, such as those by Sentinel of Shrewsbury, but in fact the principles were very different.\n\nFor the \"Rocket\" 150 event in 1980, a completely new replica of \"Novelty\" was constructed by Locomotion Enterprises in the Springwell Workshop of the Bowes Railway. It was a fully working replica that was built to look correct when display at the planned event. However, many changes were made to reduce the construction costs and meet modern standards. It has been suggested that the replica was built to last no longer than the three days of the Rocket 150 event.\n\nSome of the differences between the original and replica are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a reason that is not fully understood, the wheels of the replica were built with very narrow treads. It is possible that wheels were scaled off a model in the London Science Museum. As a result, it was unable to travel over modern pointwork.\n\nDuring the \"Rocket\" 150 event, \"Novelty\" was carried on a Well wagon, supported in such a way as to allow the engine to be run and its wheels to rotate freely.\n\nFollowing the \"Rocket\" 150 event, \"Novelty\" was steamed on a small number of occasions in Manchester. Around 1982, it was sold to the Swedish Railway Museum, Gävle, and left the UK.\nDuring July 2002, \"Novelty\" was collected from its then home in the Angelholm, for use in a TV programme. It was returned to Sweden during the spring of 2003, but made a short visit to the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester during the autumn of 2005. It also made a short visit to the Nuremberg Transport Museum in 2010.\n\nFor the BBC TV programme \"Timewatch – Rocket and its Rivals\" the replica of \"Novelty\" was transported to the National Railway Museum in York. Here it was completely dismantled to allow examination of the boiler and working parts. Several items needed to be attended to before the locomotive could be run:\n\n\nOf this work, the major item was the modification of the wheels. The solution adopted by the National Railway Museum Workshop was to employ a metal fabricator to cut four rings from 40-mm-thick steel plate. These were cut with enough precision not to need any further machining. The rings were then bolted to the existing wheels and were a complete success.\n\nFollowing re-assembly, the locomotive was steam tested at York before transport to Carrog station on the Llangollen Railway. Early tests showed up two major problems: firstly the linkage to the blower was not strong enough, and secondly operating the water feed pump caused very serious priming of the boiler. It was later shown that the feed pump was five times the size of that required for the engine. This caused air to be fed into the horizontal boiler tube probably caused the priming.\n\nTo fully recreate the Rainhill Trials, 20 return runs along a section of the Llangollen Railway were required (between Carrog and Glyndyfrdwy stations). \"Novelty\" was only able to complete 10 runs before the fire became completely filled with clinker. The inability to clear clinker from the fire in this type of boiler was a major problem, the only way being to drop the fire completely and start again.\n\nDuring the runs for the restaging of the trials \"Novelty\" was run with an electric fan (powered by a petrol generator) in place of the blower. Even allowing for this in the final calculation \"Novelty\" was much more efficient than \"Sans Pareil\"\n\nFor the Restaging, the replica of \"Novelty\" was too slow to meet the requirements of the original trials and did not complete the course. The maximum speed attained at any point was , possibly because the main steam pipe from the boiler was restricting the flow to the cylinders. The valve gear was also set incorrectly (indicated by the odd noise of the exhaust beats).\n\nWith all the obvious differences between the original and the replica, added to the fact that the locomotive crew used had only four days experience of operating the locomotive, it cannot be said that in this restaging of the trial the replica of \"Novelty\" gave the performance that the original could have achieved if more time had been made available in 1829.\n\nExcluding the original and the replicas, the following locomotives have carried the name \"Novelty:\"\n\n"}

Ulf was the father of King Sweyn II of Denmark and thus the progenitor of the House of Estridsen, which would rule Denmark from 1047 to 1375, which was also sometimes, specially in Swedish sources, referred to as the Ulfinger dynasty to honor him.\nUlf Jarl was the son of Danish chieftain Thorgils Sprakalägg. His brother Eilaf was an earl of King Cnut the Great and his sister Gytha Thorkelsdóttir married Godwin, Earl of Wessex. In 1016, he participated in Cnut the Great's invasion of England. He participated in the conquest of England as one of Cnut's most trusted men. From c. 1024 he was appointed the Jarl of Denmark and King Cnut's appointee as regent of Denmark. In the absence of King Cnut, he ruled as the foster-father and guardian of Cnut's son Harthacnut.\nIn 1015–16, he married Cnut's sister, Estrid Svendsdatter of Denmark, by whom he had sons, Svein, who later became the king of Denmark, and Beorn (Bjørn), who would become an Earl in England. Chronicler Adam of Bremen also gives Ulf a son, Åsbjørn, but does not explicitly name him as son of Estrith, as he does with Svein and Beorn. There may have also been a daughter - \"Harald Hardrådes saga\", part of \"Heimskringla\" by Snorri Sturluson gives an account of Åsmund, son of Svein's sister, yet he is likely the same Åsmund named as son of Beorn in \"Morkinskinna\".\n\nIn 1026, Swedish King Anund Jakob and Norwegian King Olaf II took advantage of King Cnut's absence and launched an attack on the Danish in the Baltic Sea. Ulf convinced the freemen to elect Harthacnut king, since they were discontented at Cnut's absenteeism. This was a ruse on Ulf's part since his role as Harthacnut's guardian would make him the ruler of Denmark. When Cnut learnt what had happened, he returned to Denmark and fought naval engagement against the Swedish and Norwegian forces at the Battle of the Helgeå. The victory left Cnut as the dominant leader in Scandinavia. \nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", which instead places the battle a year earlier in 1025, names the leaders of the Swedes as Ulf and Eglaf, usually identified with Ulf Jarl and his brother Eilaf. Saxo likewise would have Ulf fighting Cnut at Helgeå. However \"Saga of Olaf the Holy\" in the \"Heimskringla\" gives an account in which while Cnut lost the land battle, he was the overall victor when Ulf helped him win the accompanying sea battle. One possible explanation for this conflict of sources is that Ulf fought with the Swedes against Cnut in a 1025 battle not recounted by the saga because Olaf did not take part, but Ulf switched sides before the battle at Helgeå. \n\nIf Eilaf fought against Cnut, he was forgiven as he was retained as Earl in England until Cnut's death, and then fled, suggesting he was closely linked to the king. Any rapprochement with Ulf was short-lived. At a banquet in Roskilde, the two brothers-in-law were playing chess and started arguing with each other. The next day, the Christmas of 1026, Cnut had one of his housecarls kill Earl Ulf in Trinity Church, the predecessor of Roskilde Cathedral.\n\n\n"}

Ross (born Joseph Roszawikz, March 15, 1914 – August 13, 1982) was an American actor known for his trademark \"Ooh! Ooh!\" exclamation, which he used in many of his roles. He starred in such TV sitcoms as \"The Phil Silvers Show\" and \"Car 54, Where Are You?.\"\n\nRoss was born on March 15, 1914 to Jewish immigrant parents in New York, New York. He dropped out of Seward Park High School at age 16 to become a singing waiter at the Van Cortlandt Inn in the Bronx. When the cafe added a female dancer and singer, Ross was promoted to announcer. He added some jokes and became a comedian.\n\nIn 1938, he appeared at the Queens Terrace, near Jackson Heights, New York. Jackie Gleason had already been playing there for 16 weeks, and the manager was about to ask Gleason to stay a while longer. Ross heard of the opening, auditioned for it, got the contract, and also stayed 16 weeks. Ross then turned burlesque comic on the Schuster circuit out of Chicago.\n\nHis career was interrupted by World War II. He served in the United States Army Air Corps at Camp Blanding, Florida, before being stationed in England.\n\nDischarged at the war's end, Ross became an announcer-comic at Billy Gray's Band Box in Hollywood. He kept his ties to burlesque, and appeared in Irving Klaw's feature-length theatrical film \"Teaserama\" (1955), a re-creation of a burlesque show.\n\nIn 1955, Ross worked at a nightclub in Miami Beach called Ciro's. He was spotted by Nat Hiken and Phil Silvers, who were planning \"You'll Never Get Rich\" (later known as \"The Phil Silvers Show\" and sometimes \"Sgt. Bilko\") and loved Ross's comedy skills. Ross was hired on the spot and cast as the mess sergeant, Rupert Ritzik.\nRoss made Ritzik memorable. Ritzik was henpecked, dumb, and greedy, always an easy mark for Bilko's schemes. Whenever Ritzik had a sudden inspiration, he would hesitate and stammer \"Ooh! Ooh!\" before articulating his idea. The catch phrase came from the actor's own frustration when he couldn't remember his lines. Silvers would deliberately stray from the scripted dialogue and give Ross the wrong cues, prompting a genuinely confused reaction and an agonized \"Ooh! Ooh!\" from Ross.\n\nAfter \"The Phil Silvers Show\" ended in 1959, Nat Hiken went on to produce \"Car 54, Where Are You?\" and cast Joe E. Ross as Patrolman Gunther Toody of New York's 53rd Precinct. Fred Gwynne, another \"Bilko\" alumnus, played Toody's partner, Francis Muldoon. Toody could usually be counted on at some point to say \"Ooh! Ooh!\", or \"Do you mind? Doyoumind?\". Ross became so identified with his policeman role that he recorded an album of songs entitled \"Love Songs from a Cop\". Roulette Records released the LP in 1964. Ross did the voice for Toody for the episode \"Car 54\" of Hanna-Barbera's \"Wait Till Your Father Gets Home\", in which Toody and Muldoon moonlight running a day care center and one of the children turns up missing.\n\nRoss also starred as Gronk in Sherwood Schwartz's ill-fated 1966 sitcom \"It's About Time\", which featured two 1960s American astronauts who were thrown back in time to the prehistoric era.\n\nFollowing the breakup of Allen & Rossi in 1968, Steve Rossi teamed for less than three months with Ross in an act called \"Rossi & Ross\". Rossi & Ross played once on Ed Sullivan and disbanded in January 1969.\n\nRoss also was a prominent cartoon voice into the 1970s, playing the stereotypical bumbling sergeant in many cartoons such as \"Hong Kong Phooey\" (as Sgt. Flint) and \"Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch!\" (as Botch). He also voiced Roll on CB Bears segment Shake, Rattle and Roll. His \"Ooh! Ooh!\" phrase was emulated by Frank Welker in the animated series \"Fangface\". He was also one of the few white comedians with 1970s label Laff Records, which specialized in African-American comedians and released his album \"Should Lesbians Be Allowed to Play Pro-Football?\".\n\nRoss, who had trouble memorizing his lines, was often known as a difficult person to work with. Co-workers complained that he was continually vulgar, even cursing around children. Others, however, called him \"a man of sweet character\".\n\nRoss died of a heart attack on August 13, 1982 while performing in the clubhouse of his apartment building in Los Angeles, The Oakwood Apartments. He was buried in Forest Lawn-Hollywood Hills Cemetery. Jay Leno delivered the eulogy. Ross' gravestone is inscribed with the double entendre \"This man had a ball\".\n\n\n"}

Most commonly, headphone amplifiers are found embedded in electronic devices that have a headphone jack, such as integrated amplifiers, portable music players (e.g., iPods), and televisions. However, standalone units are used, especially in audiophile markets and in professional audio applications, such as music studios. Headphone amplifiers are available in consumer-grade models used by hi-fi enthusiasts and audiophiles and professional audio models, which are used in recording studios.\n\nConsumer headphone amplifiers are commercially available separate devices, sold to a niche audiophile market of hi-fi enthusiasts. These devices allow for higher possible volumes and superior current capacity compared to the smaller, less expensive headphone amplifiers that are used in most audio players. In the case of the extremely high-end electrostatic headphones, such as the Stax SR-007, a specialized electrostatic headphone amplifier or transformer step-up box and power amplifier is required to use the headphones, as only a dedicated electrostatic headphone amplifier or transformer can provide the voltage levels necessary to drive the headphones. Most headphone amplifiers provide power between 10 mW and 2 W depending on the specific headphone being used and the design of the amplifier. Certain high power designs can provide up to 6W of power into low impedance loads, although the benefit of such power output with headphones is unclear, as the few orthodynamic headphones that have sufficiently low sensitivities to function with such power levels will reach dangerously high volume levels with such amplifiers.\n\nEffectively, a headphone amplifier is a small power amplifier that can be connected to a standard headphone jack or the line output of an audio source. Electrically, a headphone amplifier can be thought of as an amplifier that presents a very high input impedance (ideally infinite) and presents a lower output impedance (ideally zero) and larger range of output voltages (ideally infinite). This allows headphones of a low sensitivity to be driven louder as a result of the extra voltage provided by the amplifier. There are potential fidelity gains if headphones are driven with lower distortion than using a headphone amplifier integrated into a general purpose audio product. In practice, this most often occurs when using low impedance headphones with consumer electronics with insufficiently low output impedance (see impedance discussion below).\n\nMost headphone amplifiers support a higher voltage output and therefore higher power (volume) levels. Whereas most portable electronics are powered by a 1.8, 2.5 or 3.3 Vpp supply, many headphone amplifiers use 10, 18 or 24 Vpp supplies, allowing 5-20 dB higher volume. If a pair of headphones is too quiet, adding an amplifier that can output higher voltage/power will increase its volume.\n\nMany headphone amplifiers have an output impedance in the range of 0.5 - 50 Ohms. The 1996 IEC 61938 standard recommended an output impedance of 120 Ohms, but in practice this is rarely used and not recommended with modern headphones. High output impedance can result in frequency response fluctuations, due to varying load impedance at different frequencies. In 2008 Stereophile Magazine published an article that showed that a 120-Ohm output impedance could cause a 5-dB error in frequency response with certain types of headphones. However, the author of the article also states: \"The ramifications for subjective assessment of headphones are more troublesome because it is usually unclear what assumptions the manufacturer has made regarding source impedance.\" \n\nMore importantly, low output impedance can reduce distortion by improving the control that the source has over the transducer. This is often expressed as damping factor, with higher damping factors greatly reducing distortion. One company shows a 45 dB improvement in THD+N at 30 Hz for their low-impedance amplifier compared to a 30-ohm amplifier. For example, a 32 Ω headphone driven by a headphone amp with a <1 Ω output impedance would have a damping factor of >32, whereas the same headphone driven with an iPod touch 3G (7 Ω output impedance) would have a damping factor of just 4.6. If the 120 ohms recommendation is applied, the damping factor would be an unacceptably low 0.26 and consequently distortion would be significantly higher. Conversely, the same iPod touch driving a pair of 120 ohm headphones would have a respectable damping factor of 17.1, and would most likely not benefit from the addition of a lower impedance headphone amplifier.\n\nIn addition to output impedance, other specifications are relevant to choosing a headphone amplifier — THD, frequency response, IMD, output power, minimum load impedance, and other measurements are also significant. However, most of these will be improved by lowering output impedance and hence improving damping factor.\n\nFor those who are electronically inclined, the low-power and fairly simple nature of the headphone amplifier has made it a popular DIY project. There are many designs for headphone amplifiers posted on the Internet varying considerably in complexity and cost. A key example is the simple opamp-based CMoy design, one of the most popular headphone amplifier designs available. The simplicity of the CMoy makes it an easy build, while it can be made small enough to fit inside a tin of breath mints (including batteries). On the other hand, it is often built using op-amps that are not designed to drive loads with as low an impedance as headphones, leading to poor performance and audible differences between op-amps that would not exist in a good design.\n\nCrossfeeding blends the left and right stereo channels slightly, reducing the extreme channel separation which is characteristic of headphone listening in older stereo recordings, and is known to cause headaches in a small fraction of listeners. Crossfeed also improves the soundstage characteristics and makes the music sound more natural, as if one was listening to a pair of speakers. While some swear by crossfeed, many prefer amplifiers without it. The introduction of digital signal processing (DSP) technology led a number of manufacturers to introduce amplifiers with 'headphone virtualization' features. In principle, the DSP chips allow the two-driver headphone to simulate a full Dolby 5.1 (or more) surround system. When the sounds from the two headphone drivers mix, they create the phase difference the brain uses to locate the source of a sound. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine as they do with crossfeed, the illusion of sound directionality is created.\n\nIn pro-audio terminology, a headphone amplifier is a device that allows multiple headsets to be connected to one or more audio sources (typically balanced audio sources) at the same time to monitor sounds during a recording session, either singing or playing from the \"live room\" or recorded tracks. Headphone amps enable singers and musicians to be able to hear other musicians who are playing in isolation booths. They also enable audio engineers and record producers to monitor a live performance or live tracking.\n\nHeadphone amps with sub-mixing capabilities allow the listener to adjust, mix and monitor audio signals coming from multiple sources at the same time. This kind of headphone amp is often utilized during recording sessions to sub-mix playback of individual stem-mixes or instruments coming from a mixing board or a playback device. In many cases the listeners have their own sets of controls allowing them to adjust various aspects of the mix and individual and global parameters such as channel level, global loudness, bass and treble.\n\nDistribution headphone amplifiers are specialized headphone amps allowing a single signal to be fed to multiple headsets or multiple groups of multiple headsets at the same time. Many distribution headphone amps, like the one shown here, can be cascaded by connecting the audio input of one of the amps to the cascading output, marked \"THRU\", of another amp.\n\nThere are also various other combinations of pro-audio headphone amps with simultaneous sub-mixing and distribution capabilities.\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by the E. W. Scripps Company. WTVR-TV's studios and transmitter are located on West Broad Street on Richmond's West End; the transmitter tower is shared with former sister station WTVR-FM and NPR member WCVE-FM.\n\nWhen the channel 6 license in Richmond came up for bids before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), it was assumed that the license would go to either Larus and Brother Company, owner of WRVA, or Richmond Newspapers, owner of WRNL, since they were considered Virginia's leading broadcasters. However, for reasons that remain unknown, neither station submitted a bid. The only applicant was the Richmond Broadcasting Company, which was nowhere near as large as either WRVA or WRNL. Its owner, auto parts dealer Wilbur Havens, also owned WMBG (AM 1380) and WCOD (98.1 FM). FCC approval was a mere formality, and WTVR debuted on April 22, 1948, as the first television station south of Washington, D.C. (WTVR's station ID famously proclaimed it to be \"The South's First Television Station\" as a result). It became an NBC affiliate June 1, 1948. For many years, it used a colorized version of its original ID slide to open newscasts. Then, as now, the station operated from a converted bus garage on West Broad Street, where WMBG had been based since 1939.\n\nIn 1953, WTVR activated its tall tower, located adjacent to its West Broad studios. The ( above sea level) tower is considered part of the Richmond skyline, and can be seen for several miles around Richmond. WTVR used a graphical version of the tower in its news opens for several years in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nAs it was one of the last stations to get a construction permit before an FCC-imposed freeze on new permits, WTVR was the only station in town until 1955. It carried programming from all four networks of the time—NBC, CBS, ABC and DuMont—but was a primary NBC affiliate. In 1955, WXEX-TV (channel 8, now WRIC-TV) signed on from neighboring Petersburg and took the NBC affiliation. WTVR then had a brief stint as a primary CBS affiliate; this ended in 1956, when WRVA-TV (channel 12, now WWBT) signed on and took the CBS affiliation due to WRVA radio's long history as a CBS radio affiliate. WTVR then carried on as an ABC affiliate until 1960, when CBS cut a new deal with Havens due to channel 12's low ratings. WTVR has been with CBS ever since, and is one of the few stations in the country to have been a primary affiliate of all of the \"Big Three\" networks, like WWBT locally. During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.\n\nHavens sold WTVR, WMBG, and WCOD to Roy H. Park Communications in 1966, earning a handsome return on his original $500 investment when he started WMBG in 1927. After taking ownership of the properties, the radio stations adopted the TV station's \"WTVR\" call letters. When Park died in 1993, the company's assets were sold to a Lexington, Kentucky group of investors that sold the radio properties separately to various owners, with WTVR-AM-FM going to Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia) in 1995. WTVR-FM is now owned by Entercom, who acquired iHeartMedia's Richmond stations in 2017, while the AM station, bought by Salem Communications in 2001 and programmed as Christian talk, was later sold by Salem and is now Spanish religious station WBTK.\n\nWTVR began suffering in the ratings in 1994 when CBS lost the rights to broadcast National Football League games to Fox (CBS returned to NFL broadcasting in 1998). However, it recovered by the turn of the century and since then has been a solid runner-up, sometimes waging a spirited battle for second place with WRIC in news ratings.\n\nPark merged with Media General, successor to Richmond Newspapers, in May 1997. However, Media General could not keep WTVR alongside its flagship newspaper, the \"Richmond Times-Dispatch\", because FCC rules of the time did not allow cross-ownership of newspapers and television stations in the same market. As a result, Media General swapped WTVR to Raycom Media in exchange for WJTV in Jackson, Mississippi, its semi-satellite WHLT in Hattiesburg, Mississippi and WSAV-TV in Savannah, Georgia two months later.\n\nWTVR was the only CBS station between Richmond and Roanoke until WCAV-TV signed on in Charlottesville in 2004.\n\nLocal features and community programs have included \"For Kids' Sake\", \"Paws for Pets\", and \"Battle of the Brains\" and a 24-hour weather news channel called \"CBS 6 Xtra\" broadcast on broadband, digital cable, and digital sub-channel 6.2 in the area. The station carried Raycom's 24/7 music television format \"The Tube\" on WTVR-DT3 until its shutdown on October 1, 2007. In March 2011, WTVR-DT3 became the new home of CBS 6 Xtra, while 6.2 carries Antenna TV (see below).\n\nOn November 12, 2007, Raycom Media announced its intention to purchase the television broadcasting and production properties of Lincoln Financial Media, including rival WWBT. Since FCC rules do not allow one person to own two of the four largest stations in a single market, Raycom decided to keep WWBT and sell WTVR to another owner. On June 24, 2008, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its intent to purchase WTVR and sell local Fox affiliate WRLH-TV (channel 35). However, the Justice Department, under provisions of a consent decree with Raycom Media, denied Raycom permission to sell WTVR-TV to Sinclair in August 2008.\n\nOn January 6, 2009, Raycom and Local TV LLC announced that they would be swapping stations in Richmond and Birmingham. In this deal, Raycom transferred WTVR plus $83 million to Local TV in exchange for that company's Fox affiliate WBRC in Birmingham. The transfer closed on March 31, 2009. As a result of the trade, Local TV owned Virginia's two largest CBS affiliates; it already owned WTKR-TV, the CBS affiliate in Norfolk, the market just to the east of Richmond. Local TV added Hampton Roads CW affiliate WGNT in 2010 after buying it from CBS.\n\nFor three months after the swap deal was completed, WTVR's Web site remained in the old Raycom-era format. This changed in late June 2009, a few days after WBRC relaunched its Web site, when WTVR migrated its Web site to the Tribune Interactive platform used by the Web sites of other Local TV-owned stations. As of 2012, Local TV migrated its Web sites to WordPress.com VIP. On July 1, 2013, Local TV announced that its stations would be acquired by the Tribune Company. The sale was completed on December 27.\n\nOn August 21, 2015, WTVR's newsroom was named in honor of Stephanie Rochon, who anchored the weeknight newscasts from 1999 to 2014. Rochon had died that June after a long struggle with cancer.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, Hunt Valley, Maryland-based Sinclair Broadcast Group – which has owned Fox affiliate WRLH-TV (channel 35) since 1996 – announced that it would acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune. Because Sinclair and Tribune each owned two television stations in the Richmond market, with WTVR and WRLH both ranking among the market's four highest-rated stations in total day viewership, the companies were required to sell one of the two outlets to an independently-operated station owner in order to comply with FCC local ownership rules. On April 24, 2018, in an amendment to the Tribune acquisition through which it proposed the sale of certain stations to both independent and affiliated third-party companies to curry the DOJ's approval, Sinclair announced that it would sell WRLH-TV and eight other stations – Sinclair-operated KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City, KDSM-TV in Des Moines, WOLF-TV (along with LMA partners WSWB and WQMY) in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and WXLV-TV in Greensboro/Winston-Salem/High Point, and Tribune-owned WPMT in Harrisburg and WXMI in Grand Rapids – to Standard Media Group (an independent broadcast holding company formed by private equity firm Standard General to assume ownership of and absolve ownership conflicts involving the aforementioned stations) for $441.1 million. The transaction includes a transitional services agreement, through which Sinclair would have continued operating WRLH for six months after the sale's completion.\n\nLess than one month after the FCC voted to have the deal reviewed by an administrative law judge amid \"serious concerns\" about Sinclair's forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties, on August 9, 2018, Tribune announced it would terminate the Sinclair deal, intending to seek other M&A opportunities. Tribune also filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that Sinclair engaged in protracted negotiations with the FCC and the DOJ over regulatory issues, refused to sell stations in markets where it already had properties, and proposed divestitures to parties with ties to Sinclair executive chair David D. Smith that were rejected or highly subject to rejection to maintain control over stations it was required to sell. The termination of the Sinclair sale agreement places uncertainty for the future of Standard Media's purchases of WRLH and the other six Tribune- and Sinclair-operated stations included in that deal, which were predicated on the closure of the Sinclair–Tribune merger.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Irving, Texas-based Nexstar Media Group—which has owned ABC affiliate WRIC-TV (channel 8) since January 2017—announced it would acquire the assets of Tribune Media for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. Nexstar is precluded from acquiring WTVR directly or indirectly, as FCC regulations prohibit common ownership of two or more of the four highest-rated stations in the same media market. (Furthermore, any attempt by Nexstar to assume the operations of WTVR through local marketing or shared services agreements may be subject to regulatory hurdles that could delay completion of the FCC and Justice Department's review and approval process for the acquisition.) As such, Nexstar will be required to sell either WTVR or WRIC to a separate, unrelated company to address the ownership conflict. On March 20, 2019, the Cincinnati-based E. W. Scripps Company announced it would purchase WTVR from Nexstar upon consummation of the merger, marking Scripps' entry into Virginia, as part of the company's sale of nineteen Nexstar- and Tribune-operated stations to Scripps and Tegna Inc. in separate deals worth $1.32 billion. The sale was completed on September 19.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nThe station became a charter affiliate of Antenna TV upon its launch in March 2011. It is carried on digital subchannel 6.2. Channel 6.3 had been carrying a loop of current weather maps and recorded weather forecasts until mid-2015, when it switched to live simulcasts of the station's newscasts with repeats of the most recent newscast airing when there wasn't a live newscast. The subchannel also airs required E/I programming on weekend mornings.\n\nWTVR-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 6, in the late morning of June 12, 2009, after more than 60 years, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 25. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers continues to display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 6. Prior to the transition, the audio component of WTVR's analog channel 6 signal at 87.75 MHz had been heavily promoted as available to listeners tuning to 87.7 on a standard FM radio receiver. WTVR lost this benefit of the analog channel 6 allocation when analog transmission ended. WTVR ended its telecasts on analog channel 6 with \"The Star Spangled Banner\", featuring images of WTVR-TV's history and the Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima.\n\nSyndicated programming on WTVR includes \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", \"Access\" and \"Extra\" among others.\n\nOutside of the Richmond market, WTVR is carried on cable in northern Virginia in Front Royal and Luray. In central Virginia, it is carried on service providers in Charlottesville, Fredericksburg, Madison and Staunton. In southside Virginia in Mecklenburg County, WTVR is carried near the North Carolina state line in Bracey along Lake Gaston. It is also carried in Chase City and South Hill.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, WTVR was once received as far south in Halifax and Enfield in North Carolina. In southern Maryland, WTVR was once carried in Leonardtown, St. Mary's County.\n\nWTVR was the overall ratings leader in Richmond until the late 1980s, when WWBT surpassed it, mainly in local news ratings and due to strength from WWBT's affiliation with NBC and its top rated primetime lineup then. For most of the time since then, the station has waged a spirited battle with WRIC for second place. During the late 1980s, early 1990s and into the 2000s, WTVR won numerous awards, including the RTNDA News Operation of the Year for two consecutive years.\n\nOn August 10, 2010, starting with the Noon newscast, WTVR became the second commercial station (behind WWBT) to broadcast local news in high definition. The change also came new graphics, music (an updated version of \"The CBS Enforcer Music Collection\" by Gari Media Group) and a new news set. On January 23, 2013, WTVR used on-air graphics that were also used on sister station KDVR, a Fox affiliate in Denver, Colorado until April 20, 2015 when they debuted new graphics and music (\"Moving Forward\" by 615 Music) that are also used by sister station WTTV (which became a CBS affiliate in January of that year) in Indianapolis.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2193241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193241", "title": "Swimming machine", "text": "Swimming machine\n\nA swimming machine is a resistance swimming apparatus, often self-contained, enabling the swimmer to swim in place. This may be accomplished either by accelerating the water past the swimmer or by supporting the swimmer, either in water or on dry land. The first type, known as a \"countercurrent swimming machine,\" usually consists of a water tank at least twice as long and about one and a half times as wide as an average person with the limbs extended. The swimmer swims unrestrained against an adjustable stream of water set in motion by means of mechanical devices, such as jets, propellers or paddle wheels.\n\nCountercurrent swimming machines made their appearance in the 1970s, initially in the form of pump-driven jetted streams, which caused a certain amount of turbulence and an un-natural swimming environment. They were followed up in the 1980s by propeller- and paddle-wheel driven machines. These provided a smoother stream of water.\n\nTwo types of exercise machines make up the second group. Hybrid systems - self-contained micropools similar to the counter-current type but using a flexible tether to keep the swimmer in place are one type. These systems, being human powered, need neither machinery or electricity but have to be carefully designed to suppress wave formation. The second type allows a person to remain on dry land while simulating certain swimming strokes. Machines of the latter type however can not compensate for the weight of the body and the limbs and thus deprive the user of the benefits of exercise in an aquatic environment. However, the higher effort required by such machines, in the absence of the metabolic effects of immersing the body in water, makes these devices more effective than true swimming if one's purpose is to achieve weight reduction. Similar in purpose, but not qualifying as \"swimming machines\" since they require access to a swimming pool, are various tether systems.\n\nThese systems depend on one or more pumps. Discharge rates of 13 L/s (200 US gal/min) and more are possible, from motors of three or four horsepower (2 or 3 kW); power requirements are determined from pump curves, where the pump is selected to maximise volumetric flow, as pressure loss is relatively low as the water does not need to be lifted, but only overcome swimmer drag and other pressure losses within the system. One of the earliest models on the market — introduced in 1973 — was the Badujet which is available only in the form of a bare propulsion system, to be installed into either an existing or newly built pool.\n\nAlso in this category are a number of swim spas, usually fiberglass shells equipped with several pool pumps to set the water in motion. Seen as more convenient since they come pre-assembled, the quality of the swim has been criticized by indoor swimmers as being somewhat turbulent, as the strength of the current comes from the speed and pressure of the discharged water, rather than its volume. Contrary to this, triathletes and other sea swimmers have praised the system due to the turbulence created by the jets mimicking the behavior of the sea, improving stamina and general fitness.\n\nSwim Spas, as the name suggests, are a combination of a spa (or hot tub) and an exercise pool. Single-zone models are typically a fibreglass pressure-driven exercise pool which has swim jets at one end, and one or more spa seats fitted with massage jets at the other.\n\nIn the 1980s Monarch Spas developed the dual-zone \"swim spa\" so that pumps and other equipment needed for the pool could also be used to power a separate spa. Today, the advantage of the modern \"dual-zone\" system is that the two pools can be at different temperatures using different chemicals - the Hot Tub (using bromine), is hot enough for relaxation and massage, while the swim zone is cool enough for strenuous exercise (using chlorine).\n\nIn the 1980s a new type of machine made its appearance. In an attempt to correct problems of turbulence and resulting discomfort from swimming against a jet of water, systems were devised to set the water in motion in a smoother fashion. The first, in 1984, was the SwimEx, developed by Stan Charren together with two MIT-trained engineers. This machine, consisting of a fiberglass pool with the machinery housed in an adjacent compartment, sets the water in motion by means of a paddlewheel, thus generating a steady stream of water as wide as the swimming pool itself.\nIn the late 1980s the Endless Pool was developed by James Murdock. This machine places the water-moving equipment - a large propeller encased in a stainless steel box and powered by a remote hydraulic pump, and its stainless steel water circulation tunnels - inside the body of a vinyl-lined metal pool. Its stream of water is narrower than that of the \"SwimEx,\" though the swimming experience is comparable. Other companies have copied this system since it was introduced.\n\nAround the same time, the \"Swim Gym,\" a propeller-driven propulsion system became available commercially. This machine is encased within a large (10\" diameter) PVC tee which is then incorporated into the concrete wall of a swimming pool. It delivers a current equivalent to that produced by Endless Pools.\n\nIn 2008, SmartPools Sdn Bhd Malaysia launched its Laminar Propulsion system using drive train technology capable of moving up to 30,000 litres of water per minute at low pressure to create a non-turbulent, bubble-free, smooth flow and speed-adjustable swimming treadmill.\n\nA number of \"still-water\" mini-pools have been built over the years, designed to be used in conjunction with various resistance-swimming tether systems. These human-powered devices combine the self-contained aspect of counter-current swimming machines with the low cost and simplicity and freedom of movement of tether systems used in athletic training. They have major cost and energy-use advantages over mechanical swimming machines. They are valuable for aerobic exercise, endurance and strength training, and for stroke practice. However, they cannot replicate open water conditions, in which the water courses at speed past the swimmer, so that for competition training their use has to be combined with open-water practice. One example of such a device is the \"Swimergy Swim System\", which also makes use of wave-reduction technology.\n"}

The very idea of \"proper\" pronunciation of Cantonese Chinese is controversial, since the concept of labeling native speakers' usage and speech in terms of correctness is not generally supported by academic linguistics. Law et al. (2001) point out that the phrase \"lazy sounds\" ( \"laan jam\"), most commonly discussed in relation to phonetic changes in Hong Kong Cantonese, implies that the speaker is \"unwilling to put forth sufficient effort to articulate the standard pronunciation\".\n\nThe promotion of \"proper\" Cantonese Chinese pronunciation is partly a reaction to so-called \"lazy sounds\" adopted by the younger generations. These \"lazy\" pronunciation variants, or sound changes include:\n\nThe nine attested phonetic sound changes in Hong Kong Cantonese, or \"lazy sounds\" in the format of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) can be tracked in the following table:\n\nTo, Mcleod and Cheung delve deeper into these sound changes in contemporary Hong Kong Cantonese, and focus in particular on the four syllable-final consonants: [-ŋ], [-n], [-k], and [-t]. After conducting original research on the pronunciation of words containing these syllable-final phonetic changes, To et al. argue that syllable-final environment sound changes occur due to the tongue position at the preceding vowel, as it opts for maximum ease. Thus, their argument attests for two process: alveolarization (occurring in [-ŋ] > [-n] transitions and [-k] > [-t] transitions) and velarization (occurring in [-n] > [-ŋ] transitions and [-t] > [-k] transitions).\n\nThe following table shows the environments where the processes of alveolarization and velarization tend to occur:\n\nAlveolarization tends to occur when there is a preceding mid-front or central vowel, and velarization tends to occur when the attested preceding mid-back vowel [ɔ] is present. The last example in table 2 indicates that the attested [ɪŋ] sequence doesn’t change, as the position of the tongue for the high, lax, front vowel is already in close proximity to the position needed to make the velar consonants.\n\nTo et al.'s research presents that the process of co-articulation accounts for the birth of \"lazy sounds\". In Hong Kong Cantonese at present, alveolarization is a more popular phenomenon than velarization, and the syllable-final alveolar consonants [-n] and [-t] tend to be preserved even when the preceding vowels prompt a tongue position that is further back. An example would be “dry” [kɔn]. It is rare for people to pronounce this with a syllable-final [-ŋ], although it still occurs, as 7.1% of adults tested by To et al. do this.\n\nThis result is presented alongside a ranking of attested preceding vowels of the [-ŋ]~[-n] pair that demonstrate the process of alveolarization, from least likely to have a succeeding 'alveolarized' consonant, to most likely: ʊ = ɪ > ɔ < ɛ < ɐ < a < œ. The vowels [ʊ] and [ɪ] share the same percentage of alveolarization, resulting in a 0.0% chance of sound change, while the highest ranking vowel, [œ], resulted in a 37.5% chance of sound change.\n\nTV and radio programs, including game shows, have been made to promote \"proper pronunciation\". The campaign has also influenced the local media. Some news reporters and masters of ceremonies in Hong Kong have adopted the \"proper\" pronunciations.\n\nThe \"proper\" readings promoted by Richard Ho are based on the \"fanqie\" spelling of \"Guangyun\", an ancient rime dictionary reflecting the sounds of Middle Chinese. Ho states that, Cantonese Chinese phonology being the descendant of the \"Guangyun\" system, there are highly regular correspondences between the sounds of Middle Chinese and those of modern Cantonese Chinese. He also holds that the \"flat\" () and \"sharp\" () tonal distinction in Middle Chinese is the most important feature from which modern Cantonese Chinese should not deviate, especially when reciting ancient literature (Ho 1995:151). He allows exceptions in some cases of colloquial speech, but not in any cases in reading ancient literature (ibid. 152).\n\nHo's approach to pronunciation is prescriptive. For instance, talking about the \"wrong\" pronunciation of final consonants of the youth, he says: \n\nHe expresses his attitude towards sound changes, when talking about the gradual merge of [n-] and [l-] initials in Cantonese Chinese: \n\nA major critic of Ho's approach is Wang Tingzhi. He calls Ho's prescriptive pronunciations \"demonic\". One of his concerns is that Cantonese Chinese comprises six historical strata, not just the one represented by the \"Guangyun\". (Wang 2005)\n\nEver since the arguments made around the correct way of pronouncing Chinese characters in Cantonese, different media companies in China have used their own interpretation of the correct pronunciations when broadcasting.\n\nIn 1981, Hong Kong TV stations followed the majority rule in terms of the correct pronunciation. At the time, the most common pronunciation for \"Time\" () was to say the last character with the same pronunciation as the word \"time rape\" () in China.\nThe shocking effect from this was realized when kindergarten kids started talking about a show \"The friends time\" as \"The friend's rape time\" due to slightly different pronunciations. After that incident, the TV stations started to realize the importance of the correct way of pronouncing characters to avoid misinterpretations.\n\nChanges in pronunciation in Hong Kong's Cantonese pronunciation have affected the Cantonese spoken in other regions, including Guangdong () and Guangxi () Provinces.\n\nVariations in Cantonese pronunciation across different regions are still a major topic of discussion. Some are seen as too informal while others are seen as having other flaws.\n\n\n\n"}

His father taught him to draw and paint, and he worked in his father’s workshop in Stockholm. On seeing a battle picture by Johan Philip Lembke at Drottningholm Palace, Johan became determined also to paint battle scenes. \nSince there was no possibility in Sweden for him to get the necessary training for his ambitions, he received financial backing from three supporters who sent him to Paris in 1752. He went to Paris by way of Copenhagen along with Norwegian-born medallionist Magnus Gustavus Arbien (1716–1760). It was in Copenhagen that he became acquainted with Carl Gustaf Pilo (1712/1713?-1793), professor at the Drawing and Painting Academy, predecessor to the Royal Danish Academy of Art (\"Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi\").\n\nHe came to Paris with good recommendations and came into the leading French art circles where he caught the attention and interest of Count Philippe de Caylus, renowned artist François Boucher, and fellow Swede Alexander Roslin (1718–1798).\n\nHe found work at François Boucher’s atelier in 1753. He was impoverished, and made small battle pictures in pen and ink, as well as copies of paintings to supplement his meager earnings.\n\nArbien helped Mandelburg secure financial support by contacting Pilo in Copenhagen, who then interested the Danish Legation secretary to the French Court in Paris Justitsråd Joachim Wasserschlebe, foreign minister Count Johan Hartvig Ernst Bernstorff and Adam Gottlob Moltke, and finally through them King Frederick V of Denmark. The King's support was generous, but conditional—Mandelburg would need to commit himself to Denmark and his Court.\n\nAfter his three-year studies in Paris he went on to Rome, where from late 1755 he came into the antique art enthusiast circle around Danish Johannes Wiedewelt, Italian Pompeo Batoni and German Anton Raphael Mengs. Wiedewelt would become a lifelong friend.\n\nHe painted several battle scenes in Rome, among which were paintings made for Wiedewelt, and for Court Marshall Bülow.\n\nOn July 1, 1758 he traveled back to Denmark in the company of Wiedelwelt. They traveled over Caprarola, Siena, Florence, Pisa, Carrara, Lucca, Bologna, Padua, Venice, and Trieste where they studied the local art collections and churches, and on through the Tyrol and Germany. They arrived back to Copenhagen on October 6, 1758.\n\nOnly 4 years after its opening in 1754, he was accepted as a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Art (\"Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi\"). When sculptor Johan Christof Petzold died in 1763, Mandelberg was granted his vacated professorship.\n\nHe married Anna Margaretha Meyer on May 26, 1781. She died May 5, 1823.\n\nHe had plenty of work, but unfortunately there came no assignments for him in his specialty area of battle painting; but he would have to be named historical and battle painter for the royal court in order to win these projects. He was mostly employed painting mythological paintings, depictions of courtly life, and decorations paintings. Among these were many large pictures and decorations for the royal palaces. He was so busy that he had to use extra help from competent students at the Academy such as Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard, with whom he would again work together on decorations to the Knights' Room at Christiansborg Palace.\n\nHe died on January 8, 1786 in Copenhagen.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2193250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193250", "title": "Arriva London", "text": "Arriva London\n\nArriva London is a bus company operating services in Greater London. It is a subsidiary of Arriva UK Bus and operates services under contract to Transport for London. It was formed in 1998 from a fusion of previously separate Arriva subsidiaries Grey-Green, Leaside Buses, Kentish Bus, London & Country and South London Transport. Operations are split between two registered companies, Arriva London North Limited and Arriva London South Limited.\n\nThe origins of Arriva London can be traced back to 1980 when the Cowie Group purchased the Grey-Green coach business in London. In February 1987, Grey-Green commenced operating bus routes in north and east London under contract to London Regional Transport.\n\nMeanwhile, on 1 April 1989 London Buses was divided into 11 separate business units, two of which were Leaside Buses and South London Transport. As part of the privatisation of London bus services, the Cowie Group purchased these business units in September 1994 and January 1995.\n\nOn 1 August 1996, the Cowie Group purchased British Bus, which owned the Kentish Bus and London & Country businesses that also operated London bus services. In November 1997, the Cowie Group was rebranded as Arriva.\n\nArriva London North Limited operates ten bus garages.\n\nAs of May 2020, Ash Grove bus garage operates routes 78 and 254.\nOne of three new garages opened in 1981 by London Buses at a cost of £3.5 million, it had space for 140 buses undercover and a further 30 in the yard. The roof was unusual in being carried by 10 35-ton triangular trusses, said to be the largest in the UK, supported on reinforced concrete columns. Although technically in Hackney, buses showed \"CAMBRIDGE HEATH Ash Grove Garage\" on their blinds.\n\nOn opening the garage took over Hackney's operation of Red Arrow routes 502 and 513 using brand new Leyland Nationals which had been stored at the garage, and also the entire Hackney and Dalston allocations. Unfortunately, Ash Grove found itself in the London Forest operation, and also had a reputation for staff militancy and closed in 1991. The garage was reopened in 1994 by Kentish Bus to operate their Leyton area route gains, although they referred to it as Cambridge Heath. It was also used over the years to house stored vehicles for the London Transport Museum, and again in 2000 to store additional AEC Routemasters that had been acquired to supplement shortages in London.\n\nIn 2000 it was reopened by the London Buses subsidiary East Thames Buses which took over the former Harris Bus routes after that company ran into financial difficulties. Hackney Community Transport also moved into the garage yard in recent times to house its routes won in the London area although East Thames Buses later moved to new premises in Mandela Way, Southwark and were replaced at the garage by Arriva's new Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses for route 38 following the conversion from Routemasters in November 2005.\n\nOn 27 April 2013, Arriva London commenced operating route 106. In addition, from May 2014, route 38 was operated with New Routemasters.\nOn 26 September 2015, route 168 was passed to Metroline.\n\nAs of May 2020, Barking garage operates routes 150, 173, 175, 325, 368 and 673.\n\nBarking garage was opened in 1992 by Grey-Green to meet the demands of their expanding North East London operations. Dix Coaches was a subsidiary of Grey-Green operating from a base in the Dagenham area, which moved to the new garage on opening, hence the DX code.\nRoute 135 was taken over by Docklands Buses on 23 May 2015.\n\nOn 30 April 2016, Arriva London took over the operation of route 368 from Blue Triangle.\n\nAs of May 2020, Clapton garage operates routes 38, 242 and night routes N38 and N242.\n\nAs of May 2020, Edmonton operates routes 259, weekend night route 158 and N279.\n\nThe garage was reopened by County Bus & Coach in 1997, and in 1998 this operation was merged with the Leaside Travel unit. In 2005 the garage was adapted for Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses on route 149.Having closed in September 2012, on 1 March 2014, Edmonton reopened to replace Lee Valley.\n\nAs of May 2020, Enfield garage operates routes 121, 192, 279, 313, 318, 349, 377, and W6.\n\nEnfield garage was built in 1927 by the London General Omnibus Company. Further land was soon acquired in the front of the garage for use as a bus stand, which later also got used as a terminus for trolleybuses. The garage was modernised at a cost of over £6 million in the early 1980s, and when it reopened in 1984 it had space for 106 buses. More recently it has become a central part of Arriva London operations with the accident repair centre and undertaking of major refurbishments.\nAs of May 2020, Grays garage operates routes 66, 103, 347, 370, 375.\n\nAs part of a decision to consolidate all of Arriva's Transport for London routes with Arriva London, Grays garage was transferred from Arriva Southern Counties on 1 January 2016.\n\nAs of May 2020, Palmers Green operates routes 34, 102, 141, 329 and 340.\n\nOpened in July 1912 by the London General Omnibus Company to house their Central London bus fleet operating in competition with the MET trams. Just before World War II the allocation at Palmers Green was entirely AEC Regents, whilst afterwards it was allocated AEC Regent III RT, RTL, RTW and SRTs the only garage to be allocated all four standard double deck types, although none could fit in the garage until the roof could be raised by 10 inches, which was completed in 1952 after a process taking 20 weeks. The garage was further modernised in 1974 by which time 60 buses were allocated. AEC Routemasters arrived in 1969 replacing the RTs, but the RTs lasted there until 1978.\n\nOne man operated buses in the form of AEC Regal VIs began arriving and were followed in time by AEC Swifts, Daimler Fleetlines, and MCW Metrobuses. The Routemasters lasted on route 29 until the late 1980s, and in 1994 the allocation was 51, entirely MCW Metrobuses. In latter years the allocation has increased slightly and other than Metrobuses, Volvo B10Ms and Alexander ALX400 bodied DAF DB250LFs have been allocated.\n\nAs of May 2020, Stamford Hill garage operates routes 73, 253 and night routes N73 and N253.\n\nAs of May 2020, Tottenham garage operates routes 19, 41, 123, 149, 230, 243, 341, N19 and N41.\n\nTottenham garage was built in 1913 by the MET to run buses to support their tram network. The buses were requisitioned during World War I, and then between 1917-1919 the garage was loaned to AEC. Before World War II in 1939 the allocation consisted of ST, STL and LTs, but during the war it was the first garage to receive utility Guy Arabs, and later in 1949 London's first 8 ft wide buses. When route 236 moved with its RFs to Dalston in 1971 it signalled an absence of single deckers at the garage that would last until 2001 when route W4 was won.\n\nMCW Metrobuses and AEC Routemasters were the staple diet of the garage for many years until the new Alexander ALX400 bodied DAF DB250LFs arrived. The final Routemasters left Tottenham in September 2004 when route 73 was converted to Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated bus operation and moved to Lea Valley. However, Tottenham has retained a single Routemaster for the Arriva London Heritage fleet for use at shows and special events. It is probably the most famous too, being the (numerically) first production Routemaster, RM5.\n\nAs of May 2020, Wood Green garage operates routes 29, 144, 184, 221, W3, W4 and night route , N29.\n\nTransformed in the early 1900s from a horse tram depot to a modern tram depot with a capacity of 67. It was completely remodelled in the late 1930s to allow for trolleybus operations and a capacity of 108. The garage was further adapted again in 1960 for buses. AEC Routemasters arrived to replace trolleybuses in April 1961, and with the closure of West Green in 1962 more work arrived.\n\nArriva London South Limited operates six bus garages.\n\nAs of May 2020, Brixton garage operates routes 50, 59, 133, 137, weekend night route 319, 333 and N133.\n\nOriginally built as a depot for cable trams which ran up Brixton Hill in 1892, it was re-built between 1904-06 for use by electric trams. In 1993 it was extended onto a site formerly owned by the water board and containing a large water main, and then in 1949 reconstruction started to bury the main and convert the depot into one large building instead of two smaller ones. The last trams ran from the depot in 1951, by which time AEC Regent III RTs had started to arrive with the last remaining until 1976.\n\nIn 1971 Brixton became one of the first to receive Daimler Fleetlines and then in 1984 MCW Metrobuses. The garage also received the first production Wright Cadet bodied DAF single deckers in 2001. Brixton was also the last depot to operate AEC Routemasters in regular service in London on route 159 until December 2005. Now the garage has only double-decker buses, all the other single-decker buses have been transferred to other garages. From 12 December 2015, route 159 passed to Abellio London with New Routemaster buses, marking Brixton's last night route.\n\nAs of May 2020, Croydon garage operates routes 60, 166, 194, 264, 312, 412, 466, 612, 627, and 685.\n\nBuilt by the London General Omnibus Company in 1915, the garage was handed over to Thomas Tilling on opening as part of an agreement between the two operators. The garage had to have roof reconstruction in the early 1930s to allow roofed double deckers to use the garage and was totally destroyed in 1941 after an air raid which also killed four staff and destroyed 56 buses. The reconstruction was finally completed in the mid-1950s. AEC Regent III RTs mainly monopolised the garage until the arrival of AEC Routemasters in 1964.\n\nIn 1969 experimental XAs and later FRM1 were tested on route 233. When the XAs departed in 1973 they were replaced by Daimler Fleetlines which lasted until January 1993. LSs started to arrive in the late 1970s and MCW Metrobus in 1985 until they were replaced by Leyland Titans. When Elmers End closed a reshuffle took place with the Routemasters departing and the garage became fully one man operated, and later in 1994, the garage became fully double deck with the departure of the last Leyland Nationals.\n\nAs of May 2020, Dartford Garage operates routes 99, 160, 229, 269, 301, 335, 401, 428, 469, 492, B12, B13 and B15.\n\nAs part of a decision to consolidate all of Arriva's Transport for London routes with Arriva London, Dartford garage was transferred from Arriva Southern Counties on 1 January 2016.\n\nAs of May 2020, Manor Road garage operates routes 99 and 229.\n\nAs of May 2020, Norwood garage operates routes 2, 137, 157, 249, 417, 450, 468, 690 and night routes N2, and N137.\n\nNorwood garage was opened in 1909 by the London General Omnibus Company. The garage has had a steady allocation over the years and in 1951 took over some of the vehicles for the Festival of Britain services from the nearby Norwood Tram Depot. In 1981 the garage underwent complete reconstruction, with the buses and staff being transferred temporarily to the reopened Clapham Garage until 1984.\n\nThe allocation has mainly been Leyland Olympians and AEC Routemasters until recently when Alexander ALX400 bodied DAF DB250s were allocated in its completely double-deck allocation which included the Northern Counties Palatine bodied Volvo Olympians which came with the operation of the former Londonlinks routes 176/route 188.\n\nThe garage previously supplied some buses and drivers for route 19 following the conversion from Routemaster operation in 2005, but this ceased with the closure of Battersea, with the whole of the route transferring to Brixton.\nAs of May 2020, Thornton Heath garage operates routes 64, 157 (Sunday's only), 198, 250, 255, 289, 410 and night route N250.\n\nOriginally opened as the garage for the first horse tramway in Croydon in 1879 it was later rebuilt as an electric tram depot in 1901. Initially, it could house 26 trams but was extended the following year to take 43 cars. Thornton Heath was earmarked for closure as a tram depot for reconstruction at the tram replacement program of 1950–52 but actually shut before the last tram finished with the work and staff moving to Purley.\n\nBuses were starting to operate from the new garage before reconstruction was complete in 1951 with 54 AEC Regent III RTs, just half of its capacity. AEC Routemasters arrived in the early 1960s bringing it up to 84 buses. The RTs lasted until 1976, outlasting the RMs which were replaced by Daimler Fleetlines in 1971, although they did return between 1976–1978 and 1982–1987 when the garage became entirely one man operated.\n\nBy 1994 the garage was worked almost entirely by Leyland Olympians and MCW Metrobuses with a few Dennis Dart and MCW Metroriders. There was also a period where the then South London Transport regularly transferred vehicles about, and whilst Thornton Heath retained its Olympians throughout, they were joined not only by Metrobuses but also Leyland Titans. Thornton Heath also briefly flirted with SR-class StarRiders, as well as sharing vehicle evaluation duties with Bromley for the DA/SA classes of vehicle, operating SA1 From October 1989 to February 1990 before swapping it for DA1, which stayed here for a further 6 months before being moved to Westlink.\n\nThe original Battersea garage was opened in 1906 by the London Roadcar Company on the north side of Hester Road, but by 1914 more space was needed and an annexe was built on the south side. Two modernisation schemes were undertaken, first in the 1960s to allow for AEC Routemasters to be allocated and again in 1971 when a new canteen and recreation room was built.\n\nThe garage closed in 1985 with its allocation being split between Victoria and Wandsworth garages. Battersea was however given a reprieve some time later when it was used to house the London Buses coaches and sightseeing operations until 1988 when the entire operation moved to Wandsworth garage. In 1993, a yard adjacent to the old garage was opened as a base for Kentish Bus route 19 operation after it had moved out of its Covent Garden Market base.\n\nMost of the area formally occupied on both the North and South sides of Hester Road has now been built into a luxury flats complex. The only section remaining is the small shed which was originally an outstation from Brixton garage housing the route 19 Routemasters. When the Routemasters left in July 2005 the garage received an allocation of Alexander ALX400 bodied Volvo B7TLs for route 19, although some of these need to be parked at (and use drivers from) Norwood garage because there was not enough space for these larger buses.\n\nIn November 2009, Battersea garage was closed and the site redeveloped.\n\nA modern purpose built depot that was largely open air. Opened in 1990 by London Country Bus Services, it ran 73 vehicles, although had space for 120. Beddington Farm was to replace the existing garages at Godstone and Chelsham and operated both LB tendered routes and existing London Country Croydon area routes. Beddington Farm became a Londonlinks depot when the Non-London work moved away before coming under Arriva South. It was transferred to Arriva London in 1999 with six routes and buses painted red, green or blue. In 2007 route 450 was transferred to Beddington Garage from Thornton Heath in a swap with route 289.\n\nOn 3 March 2012, route 455 passed to Abellio London.\n\nIn July 2011 Arriva confirmed Beddington Farm would close by 31 March 2012.\n\nAs of June 2018, Garston garage operated London routes 288, 303, 305, H18 and H19.\n\nOpened on 18 June 1952, Garston became part of London Country North West in 1986, being included in the sale of the business to Luton & District Transport in 1988 which in turn was rebranded Arriva Shires & Essex. In 1986 it became a London Regional Transport contractor when it began to operate route 142. As part of a decision to consolidate all of Arriva's Transport for London routes with Arriva London, Garston garage was transferred from Arriva Shires & Essex on 1 January 2016. It closed on 31 August 2018 coinciding with the expiry of its last Transport for London contracts.\n\nThe depot was originally operated by Tellings-Golden Miller. On 31 May 2014, the garage gained route E10 from Metroline. It used new Alexander Dennis Enviro 200 single deckers. As part of a decision to consolidate all of Arriva's Transport for London routes with Arriva London, Heathrow garage was transferred from Tellings-Golden Miller on 1 January 2016.\nDuring December 2017, the operation of route E10 was transferred to London United. As a result, the depot closed soon after.\n\nThe depot is at the back of an industrial estate alongside the River Lea close to Northumberland Park. The depot was opened in 2005 to house the Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses for route 149 which were later joined by more with the conversion of route 73.\n\nOn 15 October 2011, route W3 was transferred to this garage.\n\nOn 28 January 2012, route 318 was transferred to this garage. On 25 February 2012, route 397 was transferred to this garage. On 3 March 2012, Arriva London commenced operating route W11. On 10 March 2012, route 379 was transferred to this garage. On 24 March 2012, routes 34, 444 and 657 were transferred to this garage.\n\nOn 3 September 2012, routes 628, 653, 683 and 688 passed to Sullivan Buses.\n\nOn 1 March 2014, Lee Valley garage closed with the site acquired by National Grid with operations transferred to a reopened Edmonton.\n\nAs at May 2015, the fleet consisted of 1,460 buses.\n\nThe Heritage Fleet was set up in 2006 by Arriva. It uses AEC Routemasters for private hire work, and was formed after Routemasters in London were withdrawn from normal service in December 2005.\n\nArriva London inherited four Routemaster operator services when it purchased Leaside Buses and South London Transport: routes 19, 38, 73 and 159. Routes 19 and 159 were replaced by one man double deckers and 38 and 73 by Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses. Route 159 was the last London route to be converted on 9 December 2005, bringing 50 years of Routemaster operation to a close.\n\nFollowing this, Arriva London collected some of the more significant Routemasters in their fleet and set up the Heritage Fleet in early 2006.\n\nThe Heritage Fleet currently offer their vehicles for private hire, such as events celebration and weddings. The buses can also be hired to attend other public events, and often the buses appear at bus events, such as Showbus and the London Bus Preservation Trust Cobham bus rally.\n\nThe Heritage Fleet is made up of nine AEC Routemasters. As Arriva was the biggest operator of Routemasters before they were withdrawn from normal services, they operated some of the most significant Routemasters. These include;\n\n\n"}

Hogan began his comics career as editor of cult British comic \"Revolver\" in 1990–1991, before working for \"2000 AD\", American comic book publishers Vertigo, America's Best Comics and Dark Horse Comics.\n\nIn 1978 Pete Townshend, of The Who, asked Hogan to set up and manage his Magic Bus Bookshop in Richmond. He then worked as commissioning editor for Townshend’s Eel Pie Publishing from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. Projects included Pennie Smith’s book of Clash photos, Viv Stanshall’s Sir Henry At Rawlinson End, Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray’s Bowie – An Illustrated Record. Hogan worked on the editorial side, with John Brown (later the publisher of Viz Comic) on the business side. His known associates at that time were Dave Marsh and Patrick Humphries, rock music journalists.\n\nHogan worked as a record company press officer for Rough Trade during the early days of The Smiths, and for IRS Records where he worked for REM, as well as writing about music and film, for magazines like Melody Maker and Sky and Vox, and much later on Uncut. He went on to write books about The Bangles, The Doors, Queen, REM, The Velvet Underground and Nick Drake.\n\nHe also was a contributing writer to a biography about The Monkees pop group. \n\nHogan is the brother-in-law of noted UK comic artist/typographer/design guru Rian Hughes.\n\nFleetway then hired Hogan to edit comics, and whilst he was editing Revolver, he also co-edited The Comic Relief Comic with Neil Gaiman and Richard Curtis.\n\nLater, Hogan became a scriptwriter for the \"2000 AD\" comic, working on short story series \"Vector 13\" and \"Tharg's Dragon Tales\", as well as reinventing the long-running \"Strontium Dog\" series as \"Strontium Dogs\" and supervising the \"Durham Red\" spin-off series. Hogan also had a short stint working on \"Sam Slade, Robo-Hunter\". He also created the gentle fantasy \"Timehouse\".\n\nHowever, when David Bishop took on the editorship of \"2000 AD\", he informed Hogan that he would commission no more of Hogan's scripts because he \"didn't believe his writing fitted the comic [he] wanted 2000 AD to be.\" The two commissioned scripts, \"Strontium Dogs\" \"Hate and War\" and \"Durham Red\" \"Night of the Hunters\" were heavily rewritten and Hogan asked for his name to be removed – they were credited to Alan Smithee. With hindsight Bishop says \"He was rightly furious about having his work summarily rewritten and demanded his name taken off the scripts, which I did. I regret the brutal way I treated Peter: I was in a hurry to make changes and he caught the full force of that haste.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, Hogan wrote for some titles on DC Comics' Vertigo imprint, including \"The Dreaming\" and \"The Sandman Presents: Love Street\". Most recently, his unpublished followup to the latter, \"\", was published online. Like \"Love Street,\" \"Marquee Moon\" is a tie-in to Neil Gaiman's The Sandman and offers a look at the early days of John Constantine of \"Swamp Thing\" and \"Hellblazer\" fame.\n\nIn addition, Hogan has worked with Alan Moore on Moore's America's Best Comics series, including his own spin-off title \"Terra Obscura\". He also wrote three issues of \"Tom Strong\" with artist Chris Sprouse and the two of them returned to the character in 2010 with the limited series \"Tom Strong and the Robots of Doom\".\n\nSince 2011 Hogan has worked on his own \"Resident Alien\" series for Dark Horse. This has been adapted by Chris Sheridan into a live action TV show starring Alan Tudyk. It will air in the summer of 2020. \n\nIn 2020 Hogan returned to the pages of \"2000 AD\" working with Brendan McCarthy on Zaucer of Zilk: A Zaucer Full of Zecrets.\n\nKnown, with great affection, by many of \"The Ealing Lot\" as The Count – for his legendary nocturnal working habits.\n\nComics work includes:\n\n\n"}

Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies\n\nThe Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies (MLWGSGIS) is a public regional magnet high school in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nOne of the 18 Virginia Governor's Schools, it draws students from 13 jurisdictions: Chesterfield, Henrico, Hanover, Goochland, Powhatan, Prince George, Charles City, King and Queen, and New Kent counties, the cities of Richmond and Petersburg, and West Point, an incorporated town. As the Governor's School for Government and International Studies, it shared space at Thomas Jefferson High School (TJHS) in the city's West End from its 1991 founding until summer 2001, when it moved into Maggie L. Walker High School after massive renovations. Every year since 2006 the school was recognized by Newsweek as one of the twenty-one most elite public schools in America. In 2013, Maggie Walker was ranked 14th in Newsweek's \"Best Public High Schools\" In 2014, Maggie Walker was ranked 10th in The Daily Beast's \"Best High Schools\" and 7th in their \"25 Best High Schools in the South.\"\n\nApplicants undergo an application process in which four tests (three tests with three subsections each, one large test) and an essay are administered. A combination of grades, recommendations, and test results determine the applicants' overall score. All applicants must have completed and passed at least Algebra I or equivalent, and are expected if offered (but not necessarily required) to have completed Honors English, as well as Earth and Life Sciences, and at least one year of a foreign language, although it is not uncommon for incoming students to take their third or even fourth year of a language in their freshman year. On the other hand, many students begin language instruction in their freshman year. Overall, about 16-17% of applicants are accepted into MLWGSGIS out of a pool of around 1200 applicants from all the participating localities, making the freshmen class usually around 190 students. The school grades the applications, but it is the applicant's home school district that decides who is allowed to attend the school based on scores and available funding.\n\nEach city or county that wishes to send students to the Governor's School must fund the school for the students that they send, as well as provide busing to and from the school. While the Governor's School allows allotments for each locality that cannot be exceeded, it is the individual localities that ultimately determine their own limit on how many students can be sent within the parameters of the allotment given and available funding. The Regional School Board of the Governor's School that oversees the administration comprises one school board member from each of the participating localities.\n\nAt its 1991 founding, the Governor's School for Government and International Studies was given the Thomas Jefferson High School building to share by Richmond Public Schools. The city school stopped accepting freshmen in 1991, intending to turn the building fully over to GSGIS by 1995. However, parents, students, and alumni of TJHS, as well as city politicians, protested the closing of their school, RPS reversed its decision, and in 1992 TJ started accepting freshmen again and GSGIS started looking for a permanent home.\n\nAfter several years of false starts and administrative turnover, GSGIS finally obtained the Maggie Walker High School building, an abandoned former Richmond City school, as a permanent home. The original building, Maggie L. Walker High School, was first opened in the 1930s as a school for African-Americans. It was named for Maggie Lena Walker, the first woman and African-American to operate a bank in the United States and was once attended by American civil rights lawyer and politician Henry L. Marsh, African American tennis pro Arthur Ashe, as well as pro football Hall-of-Famer Willie Lanier, and NBA great Bob Dandridge. GSGIS took up occupancy in fall 2001 after several million dollars of renovations, the largest addition being a 35-foot dragon statue costing $43,800, and then adopted the name Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies, or MLWGSGIS for short, though commonly shortened further to MLWGS.\n\nToday, MLWGSGIS is known for its academic record and high performance in scholastic competitions such as \"We the People\" and \"Battle of the Brains.\" All academic classes are taught at an honors or higher level. A large percentage of Governor's School seniors are accepted into the University of Virginia, the College of William and Mary, the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, and a number of other well-respected universities, including many in the Ivy League and Federal Service Academies. The class of 2013 received over $14 million in merit-based scholarships for 178 senior students. Students perform well above the national and state average on the SAT, with scores averaging 2146 for the Class of 2014.\n\nIn keeping with the school's name, which indicates a focus on government and international interests, the school offers AP courses in American History, European History, American and Comparative Government, Micro and Macro Economics, Psychology, and Human Geography, and has received awards for high scores on the American History AP Test. In addition, the school offers 2 AP English courses, 2 AP Calculus courses (AB and BC), several university post-calculus math classes such as Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra, and a variety of science classes including AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Physics and AP Environmental Science, as well as Anatomy and Physiology, Genetics, Forensic Chemistry, Meteorology, Astronomy, Biopsychology (dual enrollment), and Introduction to Engineering (dual enrollment).\n\nStudents are required to have a total 4 years of a primary language, and 2 years of another to make up 6 total years of foreign language instruction. Credits can be earned before freshman year, ie. a student who takes spanish 1 and 2 in middle school receives 2 language credits in Spanish going into freshman year.Five foreign languages are offered through a 4-year, 5 year, or AP level, including French, German, Spanish, Latin, and Chinese. Japanese, Italian, Russian, American Sign Language, and Arabic are taught in a two- or three-year sequence. Many students take courses that are two or three years ahead of their grade level. In order to provide adequate course offerings, the administration also offers a plethora of Dual Enrollment courses through Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nThe school's seniors also conduct either a mentorship or seminar class during their senior year. Seminars are focused classes which are founded on student interest, and some are taught by visiting university faculty. They range in topics including international law, economics, military history, photojournalism, food preparation, and more. The mentorship program provides Maggie Walker seniors the opportunity to use class time to work at a local business with an expert in a field that interests them. Mentorship students log a minimum of 115 hours at their mentorship site, working at places such as The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Democratic campaign offices, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, art galleries, bakeries, VCU Medical Center, or Virginia Commonwealth University. Both mentorship and seminar students conduct scholarly research throughout the year dealing with their mentorship or seminar, and this research is presented at the end of the year during the school's annual senior showcase.\n\nTo foster community improvement efforts, all Governor's School students are required to complete 140 hours of community service by graduation. School clubs frequently participate in neighborhood cleanup projects. In order to receive a Governor's School diploma, all community service and credits must be completed. The 2008 graduating class completed over 34,500 community service hours.\n\nMLWGS competes in the AAA East in AAA Conference 33 of the Virginia High School League. Previously the school was in the AA Colonial District, but at the end of the 2019 season was moved up to AAA due to a growing student population. The school fields teams in basketball, dance, volleyball, wrestling, soccer, tennis, golf, swimming, field hockey, cross-country, indoor and outdoor track and field, baseball, and softball; only football is omitted from the offerings of a traditional public high school. The school mascot is the Green Dragon, adopted from the former Maggie L. Walker High School. In 2001, the boys' cross country team won the state AAA championship, led to victory by head coach Jim Holdren. In 2010, the Maggie Walker girls' cross country team became the state runner-up in the AAA championship. The Maggie Walker Cross country boys and girls teams won the 2019 cross country AAA State Competition in their respective groups. In 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011 the field hockey team won the colonial district championship. In 2008 the team was the central region runner-up to rival Thomas Dale, which qualified the team to go to states for the first time in 3 years. In 2010 and 2011 the team won the Central Region Championship and once again played in the State Tournament. In 2013-14 The Boys' and Girls' Cross Country Teams won first place in their respective AA sections and so did the Boys' and Girls' indoor Track teams. The Boys' Outdoor Track team also won First in that season. The Maggie Walker Basket Weaving team is the most successful team at the school. They have won the state and national titles since 1692. Also, the Girls' Swim team won their section in 2013-14. In 2015-2016, the Baseball team finished in 3rd at the AA state tournament to go along with a team record 17 wins, while the Girls' Soccer team finished 2nd. Swim team again won VHSL championships in 2017, this time both in the Boys' and Girls' categories. In 2017, the Baseball team captured the AA state crown, defeating rival Goochland 3-1. In 2017, Boys' soccer won the school's first VHSL 2A Boys' Soccer State Championship, ending the season on a dominant 9 game winning streak that firmly asserted the program's spot in the top-tier of the Richmond area soccer.\n\nBeginning in 2014, the Men's Tennis Team has established Maggie Walker as a dominant tennis school. The team won four consecutive state titles, from 2014-2017, and then another state title in 2019. On April 18, 2016, for the first time in school history, the team defeated local rival Mills E. Godwin, 5-4, as well as Douglas S. Freeman High School. In 2017, for the first time in school history, the team defeated another local rival Deep Run High School, 5-4, as well as Mills E. Godwin and Douglas S. Freeman High School that year. That year, the Men's Tennis Team was also nominated as a finalist for the Richmond Times Dispatch Men's Sports Team of the Year, where they finished in second place.\n\nPrior to the school's move to the Maggie Walker building, Governor's School students participated in the athletic program of host Thomas Jefferson High School, and shared TJ's Viking mascot and red/white official colors. As it became clear by 1997-98 that GSGIS students made up a majority or near-majority of participants in all offerings but football and boys' basketball, the teams in all but those two sports were officially designated Thomas Jefferson/Governor's School (TJ/GS) by the VHSL until GSGIS's move. MLWGS does not have a football team, despite being the only Richmond area school with a graduate in the NFL Hall of Fame, linebacker Willie Lanier, although he played before the school was shut down and then reopened as a magnet school.\n\nGovernor's School is home to many student clubs and activities, ranging from politically oriented clubs and Model United Nations to a Red Cross Club, as well as languages groups.\n\n\nMLWGSGIS is in a partnership with Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), meaning that students can earn college credit for certain \"dual enrollment\" high school classes. This also allows MLWGSGIS students access to VCU's library system.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2193264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193264", "title": "Publishers Clearing House", "text": "Publishers Clearing House\n\nPublishers Clearing House (PCH) is a direct marketing company that markets merchandise and magazine subscriptions with sweepstakes and prize-based games.\n\nPublishers Clearing House was founded in 1953 by Harold Mertz to replace door-to-door magazine subscription sales by a single vendor offering multiple subscriptions by mail. It introduced its sweepstakes in 1967. In the early 1990s, the company was the subject of concerns and legal actions regarding whether consumers were misled about their odds of winning the sweepstakes and whether purchases increased their chances. By 2010, the company had reached settlements with all 50 states.\n\nThe company acquired search company Blingo in 2006, online gaming company Funtank in 2010, and mobile marketing company Liquid Wireless in 2012.\n\nPublishers Clearing House was founded in 1953 in Port Washington, New York, by Harold Mertz, a former manager of a door-to-door sales team for magazine subscriptions. The company started in Mertz's basement with help from his wife LuEsther and daughter Joyce. Its first mailings were of 10,000 envelopes from Mertz's home in Long Island, New York, and offered 20 magazine subscriptions. 100 orders were received. Within a few years the company moved out of Mertz's basement into an office building and started hiring staff. When PCH moved its headquarters in 1969, its prior location was donated to the city and renamed the Harold E. Mertz community center. The company revenue had grown to US$50 million by 1981, and $100 million by 1988.\n\nIn 1967 PCH started its first sweepstakes as a way to increase subscription sales, based on the sweepstakes held by \"Reader's Digest\". The first prizes ranged from 25 cents to $10 and entrants had a 1 in 10 chance of winning. After the sweepstakes increased response rates to mailings, prizes of $5,000 and eventually $250,000 were offered. PCH began advertising the sweepstakes on TV in 1974. It was the only major multi-magazine subscription business until 1977. Former client Time Inc. and several other publishers formed American Family Publishers (AFP) to compete with PCH after the company refused repeated requests by Time for a larger share of sales revenue from magazine subscriptions.\n\nAFP and PCH competed for exclusive rights to magazines and for the better promotion and prize ideas. When AFP increased their jackpot to $1 million, then to $10 million in 1985, PCH raised its prizes to match. $7 million in prizes were distributed by 1979, $40 million by 1991 and $137 million by 2000. In 1989 two members of its advertising team, Dave Sayer and Todd Sloane, started the Prize Patrol, a publicized event where winners are surprised with a check at their home. The idea was inspired by the 1950s television series \"The Millionaire\".\n\nIn 1992 thousands of discarded sweepstakes entries from contestants who had not bought magazine subscriptions were found in the company's trash, reinforcing beliefs that the company favored those who made purchases in selecting a sweepstakes winner. PCH said this was done by a disgruntled employee at their mail processing vendor. A class action ensued, which PCH settled by giving discarded entrants a second chance to win.\n\nIn the 1990s PCH and its primary competitor, AFP, experienced a series of legal troubles due to concerns that their mailings misled consumers about their odds of winning and implied that magazine purchases increased their chances. This led to the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act of 2000, which regulates direct mail businesses. At the senate hearings regarding this Act, PCH said most consumers were not confused about their chances of winning or that purchases did not increase their chances. The company said less than five percent of participants spend more than $300. Government officials from California said 5,000 local consumers paid more than $2,500 each in magazine purchases under the false belief that they were increasing their odds of winning the sweepstakes.\n\nIndustry sources estimated PCH's response rates decreased by 7-12 percent and its sales volume by 22 to 30 percent in response to the bad publicity from the lawsuits. In 2000, PCH laid off a quarter of its 800-person work force.\n\nIn 1994 PCH sent mailings telling recipients they were all \"finalists\", which led to a lawsuit involving the attorneys general of 14 US states. Later that year, PCH denied wrongdoing, but agreed to pay a settlement of $490,000 and to change their practices. Under the agreement, PCH said it would define terms like \"finalist\" and disclose the chances of winning.\n\nIn 1997, a contestant of competitor AFP flew to Tampa, Florida, thinking he had won, though he had not. The resulting publicity caused more lawsuits for both companies. PCH reached a $30 million national settlement in 1999. In 2000, another $18 million settlement was reached with 24 states, after the company sent mass mailings that said \"You are a winner!\" and used mock personalized checks. PCH agreed to avoid similar mailings in the future, and add a \"sweepstakes fact box\" to mailings.\n\nState attorneys spoke out against the national settlement from 2000 and additional lawsuits were filed by individual states. Another $34 million settlement was reached in 2001 in a lawsuit involving 25 states, bringing the total settlements since 1999 to $82 million. As part of the settlement, PCH was required to avoid terms like \"Guaranteed Winner,\" add disclaimers to mailings saying that the recipient has not won and that purchasing merchandise won't increase their chances. PCH reached settlements with all fifty states and agreed to work with a \"compliance counsel.\" PCH apologized in the settlement and said it would contact customers who had spent more than $1,000 on merchandise the prior year.\n\nPCH also reached an agreement with Iowa in 2007. In 2010 the company paid $3.5 million to the Attorneys General of 32 states and the District of Columbia to settle possible contempt charges that it had violated the terms of the 2001 agreement. The company denied wrongdoing, but agreed to work with both an ombudsman and a compliance counsel who would review its mailings quarterly.\n\nIn April 2014, an investigation by the Senate Special Committee on Aging concluded that PCH had \"pushed the limits\" of prior agreements and that additional legislation may be needed. \n\nIn April, 2018 a lawsuit was filed in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging that PCH engaged in deceptive marketing practices through direct mail and email marketing campaigns, as well as targeting elderly, in violation of federal and state law.\n\nPCH began selling merchandise in 1985 with two products. After a Hershey's Chocolate Cookbook and a diet cookbook sold more than other products, the company began expanding into jewelry, media, collectibles, household products and others. The company also shifted its focus online. It began selling magazine subscriptions and merchandise on PCH.com in 1996. In 2006, it acquired Blingo Inc., an ad-supported metasearch engine that was later re-branded as PCH Search and Win. PCH ran contests on Twitter, Facebook, and Myspace. iPhone apps for slot games and trivia were developed. The company created online play-and-win sites like PCH Games (formerly Candystand) and PCHQuiz4Cash, with air-hockey and video poker games.\n\nIn December 2010, PCH acquired Funtank and its online gaming site Candystand.com. In 2011, PCH promoted a \"$5,000 every week for life\" sweepstakes in TV ads and the front page of AOL.com. The following year the company acquired a mobile marketing company, Liquid Wireless. The company utilized, then stopped then started again utilizing coregistration (through other websites) to expand its customer base.\n\nIn 2008, a PCH spokesperson said the digital properties were intended to attract younger consumers. By 2013, the internet had become PCH's primary channel of interaction with consumers. \"The New York Times\" described the digital transition as \"part of an overall effort to collect information on Web users, show them advertisements and use the registration information for PCH’s mailing lists.\"\n\nPCH is a direct-marketing company that sells merchandise, magazine subscriptions and operates several prize-based websites. While best known for the sweepstakes and Prize Patrol it uses to promote its magazine subscriptions, the majority of the company's revenue now comes from merchandise. The company has been selling books, media, jewelry and other consumer items since the 1980s. PCH operates eight websites, including PCH Search and Win, PCH Lotto, PCH Games, PCH Save and Win, and Candystand.\n\nThe company also sells magazine subscriptions at a discount and advertises subscriptions along with its sweepstakes. It's estimated that companies like PCH keep 75-90 percent of the fees from the original subscription, while publishers use the increased distribution to improve circulation numbers and revenue from renewals. PCH popularized the idea of using sweepstakes to sell magazine subscriptions in the direct-marketing market and became known by detractors as a producer of junk-mail for advertising through mass-mailings. Documents filed with the New York State Department in 1993 said that year the company mailed 220 million envelopes. Frequent buyers can receive 30-40 mailings a year.\n\nAlthough PCH advertises its sweepstakes along with magazine subscriptions, no purchase is necessary to enter or win. In 1995, PCH began the tradition of announcing winners of its $10 million prize just after the Super Bowl. As of 2012, $225 million in prizes have been distributed. Some of its larger prizes are for $5,000 a week for life, or $10 million. Prizes can also range from $1 Amazon gift cards to $2,500, $1 million or $3 million. The larger cash prizes are paid in installments, typically with a balloon payment at 30 years, reducing the present value of prizes to much less than their nominal values.\n\nAccording to the official rules, as of February 2019, the odds of winning “$5,000 a Week for Life” in Giveaway 13000 are 1 in 6.2 billion. To put that in perspective the world's population is 7.7 billion. The odds of winning a PCH sweepstakes vary depending on the number of entries and what prize or sweepstakes is involved. Smaller prizes have better odds that may vary from one in 223 to one in 80,000, depending on the prize.\n\nThe Prize Patrol surprises sweepstakes winners at their homes, work or other locations with cash prizes and captures the event on video. Since their introduction in 1989, these reality TV-style videos of prize-winners surprised at their doorstep with checks for $1,000 to $10 million have been used in widely broadcast television commercials, and, more recently, in the company's online acquisition efforts, websites and social media communications. In 2013, a $5 million television campaign modified the traditional prize patrol commercial by digitally altering video from classic sitcoms like \"The Brady Bunch\" and \"Gilligan's Island\" to show the prize patrol visiting characters in the show.\n\nThe Prize Patrol has made in-person appearances or delivered prizes on TV programs such as \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" \"The Price Is Right\". and Let's Make A Deal. Their surprise winning moments have been spoofed by Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien and the cast of \"Saturday Night Live\"; woven into the plots of movies such as \"Let's Go to Prison\", \"The Sentinel\" and \"Knight and Day\"; Early Edition, and the subject of cartoons.\n\n"}

Subtitled \"A Sexual Musical,\" the show began previews at the Morosco Theatre on Broadway on July 7, 1976, and closed on October 2, 1976 after 108 performances. The show includes the songs \"I'm Gay\", \"Come in My Mouth\", \"Fellatio 101\", and \"The Cunnilingus Champion of Company C,\" and features on-stage nudity.\n\nThe show was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1975 for Best Original Cast Album.\n\n\"Let My People Come\" opened Off-Broadway on January 8, 1974 at The Village Gate and closed on July 5, 1976. A second New York City production opened in 1985, produced by Bernard Jay. A third New York City production opened in 2013 at The Underground, produced and directed by John Forslund, and featured both new and re-imagined numbers from the original production.\n\nThe show had a 10 year run at Grendel's Lair Cabaret Theatre in Philadelphia, and an 8 year run at the Basin Street Cabaret Theater in Toronto. The show also had runs in Chicago and London.\n\nOriginally produced and directed by Phil Oesterman, with musical direction and vocal arrangements by Billy Cunningham, the show opened on Broadway in previews at the Morosco Theater on July 7, 1976.

{"id": "2193281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193281", "title": "Taq polymerase", "text": "Taq polymerase\n\nTaq\" polymerase is a thermostable DNA polymerase I named after the thermophilic eubacterial microorganism \"Thermus aquaticus,\" from which it was originally isolated by Chien et al. in 1976. Its name is often abbreviated to Taq or Taq\" pol. It is frequently used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a method for greatly amplifying the quantity of short segments of DNA.\n\n\"T. aquaticus\" is a bacterium that lives in hot springs and hydrothermal vents, and \"Taq\" polymerase was identified as an enzyme able to withstand the protein-denaturing conditions (high temperature) required during PCR. Therefore, it replaced the DNA polymerase from \"E. coli\" originally used in PCR.\n\n\"Taq\"'s optimum temperature for activity is 75–80 °C, with a half-life of greater than 2 hours at 92.5 °C, 40 minutes at 95 °C and 9 minutes at 97.5 °C, and can replicate a 1000 base pair strand of DNA in less than 10 seconds at 72 °C. At 75-80 °C, \"Taq\" reaches its optimal polymerization rate of about 150 nucleotides per second per enzyme molecule, and any deviations from the optimal temperature range inhibit the extension rate of the enzyme. A single \"Taq\" synthesizes about 60 nucleotides per second at 70 °C, 24 nucleotides/sec at 55 °C, 1.5 nucleotides/sec at 37 °C, and 0.25 nucleotides/sec at 22 °C. At temperatures above 90 °C, \"Taq\" demonstrates very little or no activity at all, but the enzyme itself does not denature and remains intact. Presence of certain ions in the reaction vessel also affects specific activity of the enzyme. Small amounts of potassium chloride (KCl) and magnesium ion (Mg) promote \"Taq\"'s enzymatic activity. \"Taq\" polymerase is maximally activated at 50mM KCl and just the right concentration of Mg which is determined by the concentration of nucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). High concentrations of KCl and Mg inhibit \"Taq\"'s activity. Interestingly, the common metal ion chelator, EDTA, directly binds to \"Taq\" in the absence of these metal ions.\n\nOne of \"Taq\"'s drawbacks is its lack of 3' to 5' exonuclease proofreading activity resulting in relatively low replication fidelity. Originally its error rate was measured at about 1 in 9,000 nucleotides. Some thermostable DNA polymerases have been isolated from other thermophilic bacteria and archaea, such as \"Pfu\" DNA polymerase, possessing a proofreading activity, and are being used instead of (or in combination with) \"Taq\" for high-fidelity amplification. Fidelity can vary much between Taq's, having profound effects in downstream sequencing applications.\n\n\"Taq\" makes DNA products that have A (adenine) overhangs at their 3' ends. This may be useful in TA cloning, whereby a cloning vector (such as a plasmid) that has a T (thymine) 3' overhang is used, which complements with the A overhang of the PCR product, thus enabling ligation of the PCR product into the plasmid vector.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Kary Mullis was working at Cetus Corporation on the application of synthetic DNAs to biotechnology. He was familiar with the use of DNA oligonucleotides as probes for binding to target DNA strands, as well as their use as primers for DNA sequencing and cDNA synthesis. In 1983, he began using two primers, one to hybridize to each strand of a target DNA, and adding DNA polymerase to the reaction. This led to exponential DNA replication, greatly amplifying discrete segments of DNA between the primers.\n\nHowever, after each round of replication the mixture needs to be heated above 90 °C to denature the newly formed DNA, allowing the strands to separate and act as templates in the next round of amplification. This heating step also inactivates the DNA polymerase that was in use before the discovery of \"Taq\" polymerase, the Klenow fragment (sourced from \"E. coli\"). \"Taq\" polymerase is well-suited for this application because it is able to withstand the temperature of 95 °C which is required for DNA strand separation without denaturing.\n\nUse of the thermostable \"Taq\" enables running the PCR at high temperature (~60 °C and above), which facilitates high specificity of the primers and reduces the production of nonspecific products, such as primer dimer. Also, use of a thermostable polymerase eliminates the need to add new enzyme to each round of thermocycling. A single closed tube in a relatively simple machine can be used to carry out the entire process. Thus, the use of \"Taq\" polymerase was the key idea that made PCR applicable to a large variety of molecular biology problems concerning DNA analysis.\n\nHoffmann-La Roche eventually bought the PCR and \"Taq\" patents from Cetus for $330 million, from which it may have received up to $2 billion in royalties. In 1989, Science Magazine named \"Taq\" polymerase its first \"Molecule of the Year\". Kary Mullis received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993, the only one awarded for research performed at a biotechnology company. By the early 1990s, the PCR technique with \"Taq\" polymerase was being used in many areas, including basic molecular biology research, clinical testing, and forensics. It also began to find a pressing application in direct detection of the HIV in AIDS.\n\nIn December 1999, U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker ruled that the 1990 patent involving \"Taq\" polymerase was issued, in part, on misleading information and false claims by scientists with Cetus Corporation. The ruling supported a challenge by Promega Corporation against Hoffman-La Roche, which purchased the \"Taq\" patents in 1991. Judge Walker cited previous discoveries by other laboratories, including the laboratory of Professor John Trela in the University of Cincinnati department of biological sciences, as the basis for the ruling.\n\n\"Taq\" PolA has an overall structure similar to that of \"E. coli\" PolA. The middle 3'–5' exonuclease domain responsible for proofreading has been dramatically changed and is not functional. It has a functional 5'-3' exonuclease domain at the amino terminal, described below. The remaining two domains act in coordination, via coupled domain motion.\n\n\"Taq\" polymerase exonuclease is a domain found in the amino-terminal of \"Taq\" DNA polymerase I (thermostable). It assumes a ribonuclease H-like motif. The domain confers 5'-3' exonuclease activity to the polymerase.\n\nUnlike the same domain in \"E. coli\", which would degrade primers and must be removed by digestion for PCR use, this domain is not said to degrade the primer. This activity is used in the TaqMan probe: as the daughter strands are formed, the probes complementary to the template come in contact with the polymerase and are cleaved into fluorescent pieces.\n\n\"Taq\" polymerase is bound at its polymerase active-site cleft with the blunt end of duplex DNA. As the \"Taq\" polymerase is in contact with the bound DNA, its side chains form hydrogen bonds with the purines and pyrimidines of the DNA. The same region of \"Taq\" polymerase that has bonded to DNA also binds with exonuclease. These structures bound to the \"Taq\" polymerase have different interactions.\n\nA site-directed mutagenesis experiment that improves the vestigal 3'-5' exonuclease activity by a factor of 2 has been reported, but it was never reported whether doing so decreases the error rate. Following a similar line of thought, chimera proteins have been made by cherry-picking domains from \"E. coli\", \"Taq\", and \"T. neapolitana\" polymerase I. Swapping out the vestigal domain for a functional one from \"E. coli\" created a protein with proof-reading ability but a lower optimal temperature and low thermostability.\n\nVersions of the polymerase without the 5'-3' exonuclease domain has been produced, among which \"Klentaq\" or the \"Stoffel\" fragment are best known. The complete lack of exonuclease activity make these variants suitable for primers that exhibit secondary structure as well as for copying circular molecules. Other variations include using \"Klentaq\" with a high-fidelity polymerase, a \"Thermosequenase\" that recognizes substrates like T7 DNA polymerase does, mutants with higher tolerances to inhibitors, or \"domain-tagged\" versions that have an extra helix-hairpin-helix motif around the catalytic site to hold the DNA more tightly despite adverse conditions.\nBecause of the improvements \"Taq\" polymerase provided in PCR DNA replication: higher specificity, fewer nonspecific products, and simpler processes and equipment, it has been instrumental in the efforts made to detect diseases. “The use of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in infectious disease diagnosis, has resulted in an ability to diagnose early and treat appropriately diseases due to fastidious pathogens, determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of slow growing organisms, and ascertain the quantum of infection.” The implementation of \"Taq\" polymerase has saved countless lives. It has served an essential role in the detection of many of the world’s worst diseases, including: tuberculosis, streptococcal pharyngitis, atypical pneumonia, AIDS, measles, hepatitis, and ulcerative urogenital infections. PCR, the method used to recreate copies of specific DNA samples, makes disease detection possible by targeting a specific DNA sequence of a targeted pathogen from a patient’s sample and amplifying trace amounts of the indicative sequences by copying them up to billions of times. Although this is the most accurate method of disease detection, especially for HIV, it is not performed as often as alternative, inferior tests because of the relatively high cost, labor, and time required.\n\nThe reliance upon \"Taq\" polymerase as a catalyst for the PCR replication process has been highlighted during the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020. Shortages of the necessary enzyme have impaired the ability of countries worldwide to produce test kits for the virus. Without \"Taq\" polymerase, the disease detection process is much slower and tedious.\n\nDespite the advantages of using \"Taq\" polymerase in PCR disease detection, the enzyme is not without its shortcomings. Retroviral diseases: HIV, HTLV-1, and HTLV-II; often include mutations from guanine to adenine in their genome. Mutations such as these are what allow PCR tests to detect the diseases but \"Taq\" polymerase’s relatively low fidelity rate makes the same G-to-A mutation occur and possibly yield a false positive test result.\n"}

Until 2002 its operations included Colchester. It is a subsidiary of Arriva UK Bus.\n\nOperations are split between two registered companies, Arriva East Herts & Essex Limited and Arriva The Shires Limited.\n\nArriva East Herts & Essex Limited is based in Harlow, and operate two bus garages in Harlow (Fourth Avenue) and Ware (Marsh Lane).\n\nArriva East Herts & Essex emerged from London Country North East (LCNE), one of the successor companies of London Country Bus Services. LCNE was broken in two. One of the successor companies, County Bus & Coach, with depots at Harlow, Hertford and Grays, was bought by its management in 1990. In 1994 County was sold to West Midlands Travel, itself bought by National Express in 1995. The Cowie Group bought County from National Express in 1996. County Bus & Coach was renamed Arriva East Herts & Essex in April 1998.\n\nCowie had also acquired Southend Transport and Colchester Borough Transport with its acquisition of British Bus in 1996. Both companies became part of Arriva East Herts & Essex, but in 2002 were transferred to Arriva Southern Counties together with the former County depot at Grays.\n\nHarlow garage was opened by London Transport on 22 May 1963 to serve Harlow New Town and also to replace Epping garage. Harlow was allocated 25 AEC Regent III RTs, 16 AEC Routemasters (to operate Green Line routes 718, 720 & 720A), seven RFs and two coach RFs. London Country North East and County Bus used the garage until The Cowie Group purchased County Bus in 1997.\n\nThis was previously an Arriva East Herts & Essex garage, but it is now part of the Tellings-Golden Miller subsidiary with buses are branded as Network Harlow. In 2015, it reverted to being part of Arriva Southern Counties. \n\nWare garage replaced the Hertford depot in 1993. It runs part of route 724 along with Harlow garage. Operation of London bus route 327 was transferred from Ware to Arriva London's Enfield garage on 3 January 2009. Ware did briefly become an Arriva The Shires garage in late 2010, before transferring back to Arriva East Herts & Essex. On 4 September 2010 routes 250 and 251 transferred from Harlow to Ware.\n\nArriva The Shires Limited is based in Luton and operates bus garages in Luton, Watford, High Wycombe, Aylesbury, Stevenage, Hitchin and Hemel Hempstead.\n\nArriva the Shires evolved from the purchase of the Luton, Aylesbury and Hitchin depots of United Counties by Luton & District Transport in a management buy-out in 1987. Depots at Watford, High Wycombe, Hemel Hempstead, Amersham and Slough were acquired with London Country North West in 1990, although Amersham has since closed and Slough was later sold to Bee Line. LDT was bought in 1994 by British Bus, itself bought in 1996 by The Cowie Group. LDT's was renamed Arriva the Shires in April 1998.\n\nAylesbury depot was a depot of United Counties acquired by LDT in 1987.\n\nLater in 1987 LDT also acquired the long-established Aylesbury independent company, Red Rover.\n\nHemel Hempstead was a depot of London Country Bus Services (North West) (one of the companies into which London Country Bus Services was divided in 1986), acquired by Luton & District Transport in 1988.\n\nHigh Wycombe was another depot of London Country Bus Services (North West), acquired by LDT in 1988.\n\nIn 2000 Arriva also bought the High Wycombe depot of the Go-Ahead Group's Oxford Bus Company (which had bought it from the Bee Line in 1994).\nIn 2005 High Wycombe garage moved to a new purpose built depot following the closure of the old bus station in the town, where the previous garage was. High Wycombe operate a number of services.\n\nHitchin depot was a depot of United Counties acquired by LDT in 1987.\n\nHitchin services have been worked from Stevenage garage since January 2007 following the closure of the old former United Counties garage in Fishponds Road. Services around the Hitchin area have been reduced, and many are operated by other contractors including Centrebus.\n\nLuton depot is purpose-built and is at 487 Dunstable Road. It replaced the previous depot at Castle Street. It also houses the Head Office for Arriva The Shires & Essex as well as the UK bus team.\n\nLuton operates Green Line route 757 as well as local bus services, Luton also has an outstation at Stansted Airport which operates the EB2 an easyBus contract.\n\nThe Hitchin depot was a depot of United Counties acquired by LDT in 1987.\n\nHitchin services have been worked from Stevenage garage since January 2007 following the closure of the old former United Counties garage in Fishponds Road. Services around the Hitchin area have been reduced, and many are operated by other contractors including Centrebus.\n\nArriva is the main operator in Stevenage. They operate most services in the town, along with Centrebus. \n\nThere are two depots at Stevenage; Babbage Road (ex Sovereign) and Norton Green Road.\n\nWhen London Country Bus Services was broken up in 1986, the Stevenage depot passed to London Country North East, sold in 1988 to AJS Group who established the Sovereign brand. Most of the operation was sold in 1990 to Luton & District Transport, and therefore became part of Arriva in 1996. In 1996 Arriva took over several vehicles and routes from Sovereign, by then owned by the Blazefield Group, in exchange for the London Green Line route 797. In 2004 Arriva acquired the last remaining Sovereign operation. Blazefield had already sold its London operations to Transdev London and its St Albans depot and routes to Centrebus.\n\nIn February 2006 Arriva bought the operations of MK Metro for £5.6 million, and operational control transferred to The Shires & Essex. The purchase was subsequently considered by the Office of Fair Trading for possible referral to the Competition Commission, but it decided not to. Vehicles and publicity for the Milton Keynes operation continued to use the MK Metro name until April 2010, when they were rebranded as Arriva Milton Keynes, temporarily using the brand name \"MK Star\". The change of name coincided with a number of controversial service changes. Many services were improved in frequency as part of the rebranding but others were reduced or withdrawn and some journey times were increased.\n\nArriva The Shires previously operated 2 routes in the Waltham Abbey area:\nRoute 250 remained in competition with route 255 operated by Harlow-based Roadrunner buses. Earlier in 2013 Arriva withdrew route 250 service to provide a stronger service on the 251 and to expand onto the 310 route from Waltham Cross to Ware. Many of the buses used on the 250 service can now be seen on the 251 service operating from Upshire to Hammond Street more frequently.\n\nAs of May 2015, Watford garage operated London routes 142, 258, 268, 288, 303, 305, 340, 631, 642, H2, H3, H18 and H19. It also operated LSP route 8, and school routes. As part of a decision to consolidate all of Arriva's Transport for London routes, Watford garage was transferred to Arriva London on 1 January 2016. Due to high running costs, Watford depot closed in 2018, with the routes being transferred to Hemel Hempstead. On Sunday 8 April 2018, the Amersham & District Motorbus Society held its annual running day in honour of the depot, with the theme being 'Farewell to Garston garage'. In 2019, the site was sold to Fairview New Homes with the vision to convert it into 165 residential houses.\n\nWatford was a depot of London Country Bus Services (North West) (one of the companies into which London Country Bus Services was divided in 1986), acquired by Luton & District Transport in 1988.\n\n"}

Grays depot switched to all Transport for London services after Arriva Southend withdrew both commercial routes 373 and 383 in the Grays area, partially replacing them by extending route 5 from Southend-on-Sea. Routes 44 and 150, the remaining services in the Grays area, are operated under contract to Thurrock Council. The buses used for these routes were transferred to Southend.\n\nAs at September 2014, Dartford garage operated London routes 160, 428, 492, B12, B13 and B15.

It was a subsidiary of Arriva twice previously, but once again has returned to family ownership. The company is now a subsidiary of Falcon Coaches based in Byfleet, Surrey.\n\nReputedly, Fred Varney founded the Golden Miller company with the winnings from a bet made on the horse Golden Miller, which won the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the Grand National in 1934.\n\nIn 1955 Golden Miller was sold to FG Wilder & Sons Limited of Feltham with two coaches and a booking office in Twickenham. In 1967 Wilder bought out \"Tourist Bus Service\" which had one vehicle and a stage carriage licence for route 601 between Feltham station and East Bedfont, which it had operated since 1955. In 1968 routes 602 (Feltham to Shepperton) and 603 (Feltham to Hanworth via Elmwood Avenue) were added.\n\nIn 1970 the route from Walton-on-Thames to Walton-on-Thames station was taken over from Walton-on-Thames Motor Co Limited and extended to Oatlands village as route 604. Route 605 was planned for the Claygate area but did not come into effect, and route 606 began in 1971 from Staines to Stanwell Moor and Stanwell village.\n\nIn June 1985 Wilder sold Golden Miller to Tellings Coaches of Byfleet, a family-run concern which had been founded by Stephen Telling in 1972. Routes 601 and 603 were transferred to Fountain Coaches of Feltham from October 1985; these routes being combined as route 600 (East Bedfont to Hanworth via Feltham) in June 1986. The Golden Miller business continued to operate routes 602 and 606 until about 1988.\n\nIn 1989 the company was taken over by Midland Fox. A small number of London Transport contracted routes were won by the company over the following two years. However, by 1993 Midland Fox had itself been acquired by British Bus and was no longer willing to operate TGM. Stephen Telling re-acquired the company with financial support from Julian Peddle, and also took over Classic Coaches.\n\nIn 2003 the company was floated on the Alternative Investment Market. TGM operates coaches and maintains subsidiaries in Cambridgeshire, Essex, Suffolk, Surrey and the North East of England, and operates services under the Classic Coaches, Excel Passenger Logistics, Flight Delay Services, Link Line Coaches, Network Colchester and OFJ Connections brands.\n\nThe company previously ran bus services in South West London and north west Surrey, inheriting some through acquisition of Capital Logistics. These services were sold to National Express in June 2005 and incorporated into its Travel London business. As part of the deal Tellings Golden Miller became a National Express contractor, running several coach routes out of its Cambridge and Portsmouth garages.\n\nIn June 2007 Tellings-Golden Miller re-entered the Surrey bus business with the purchase of Wiltax, New Haw with 20 buses from Rotala. In December 2007 Tellings-Golden Miller was purchased by Arriva.\n\nIn April 2008, TGM acquired Excel Passenger Logistics based at Stansted Airport and its associated companies Excel Gatwick and Flight Delay Services based at Manchester Airport. In April 2008, the Wiltax operations were scaled back with most routes passing to other operators. Some routes continued to be run by Wiltax, but from Tellings-Golden Miller's Heathrow depot. In September 2008, Wiltax' New Haw depot closed, with all operations transferred to TGM's Heathrow depot. \n\nIn February 2010 the Haverhill operations of Burton's Coaches, together with the name, were sold to Yellow Star Travel Services. The National Express services had been earlier transferred to the Stansted depot of Excel Passenger Logistics. Burton's ceased operating in May 2011. In August 2010, TGM Group took over the Arriva Shires & Essex services from Harlow garage, with a Network Harlow identity for the local routes (similar to Network Colchester). \n\nOn 31 May 2014, Tellings-Golden Miller once again became a Transport for London contracted operator when it commenced operating route E10 from its Heathrow depot, the first route it has operated in London since the late 1990s. In January 2016, as part of a decision to consolidate all of Arriva's Transport for London routes, route E10 was transferred to Arriva London.\n\nIn March 2015, Network Colchester and Network Harlow operations were transferred to Arriva Southern Counties.\n\nIn December 2016, Tellings-Golden Miller once again became a family owned business, reverting to its own identity. \n\n"}

It is a subsidiary of ComfortDelGro Corporation and operates services under contract to Transport for London. Operations are split between two registered companies, Metroline Travel Limited and Metroline West Limited.\n\nOn 1 April 1989, London Buses was divided into 11 separate business units, one of which was Metroline. As part of the privatisation of London bus services, Metroline was sold in October 1994 to a management buyout. In July 1998, it purchased MTL London and in March 2000 was sold to ComfortDelGro. In August 2004 ComfortDelGro purchased Thorpes and in November 2004 Armchair Passenger Transport with seven routes and 86 buses. The coach business of Armchair was absorbed into ComfortDelGro-owned Westbus UK in 2006. Thropes and Armchair initially retained their existing names before being rebranded to Metroline in January 2007. \n\nWhen privatised, Metroline adopted a livery of red with a dark blue skirt. This was briefly changed to light blue in the mid 2000s before the dark blue was reinstated. In June 2009, Metroline adopted an all red scheme to comply with Transport for London requirements. In 2014, a blue, white and red livery was introduced on buses dedicated to non-Transport for London services.\n\nOn 22 June 2013, Metroline purchased First London's Alperton, Greenford, Hayes, Uxbridge and Willesden Junction depots with 494 buses.\n\nMetroline West Limited operates five bus garages purchased from First London in June 2013.\n\nAs of February 2017, Alperton garage operated routes 83, 223, 224, 483, 487 and N83.\n\nOne of three garages built by the London Passenger Transport Board, and the only one to survive, Alperton Garage opened in June 1939, adjacent to the Piccadilly line tube station of the same name.\n\nWhen it opened it had an allocation entirely of STLs which were reshuffled from Cricklewood, Hanwell, Harrow Weald and Willesden garages. As Alperton was a new garage and had plenty of headroom it was one of the few garages able to take utility Guy Arabs, and at one stage these made up its complete allocation and lasted until 1954 when they were replaced by STLs.\n\nBy 1972 with the arrival of numerous AEC Merlin and AEC Swift class single deck buses to operate the numerous one man operated services, and the further allocation of Daimler Fleetlines, parking space was becoming a problem. It therefore became necessary to park a dozen or so buses on nearby Glacier Metals' car park overnight. The garage was consequently enlarged between 1976 and 1978, which encompassed the adjacent former Underground substation, and the LT Lifts and Escalators department which had to move out to new premises. During the reconstruction works, 18 vehicles were outstationed at Stonebridge (SE).\n\nThe last AEC Regent III RT buses were transferred out in 1975, and until the beginning of the 1980s, Alperton had an entirely AEC Routemaster and Daimler Fleetline allocation. The first MCW Metrobuses arrived in 1981, and gradually replaced the Daimler Fleetlines on all the one man operated routes, and would become the mainstay of the fleet for many years.\n\nFollowing the September 1982 service reductions, all the remaining Routemasters were transferred to other garages, route 83 and 187 being one manned at the same time. Replacement Metrobuses were allocated to make up the allocation (mainly used vehicles from Edgware (EW), Hanwell (HL), and Fulwell (FW), making the garage all Metrobus.\n\nBy 1995, Alperton was doing most of the maintenance for the CentreWest operation and had also become the home of the training fleet.\n\nOn 6 August 2016, route 245 was transferred from this garage to Perivale East (PV) garage.\n\nFrom 10 September 2016, Route 483 will operate from Alperton garage.\n\nAs of February 2017, Greenford garage operated routes 92, 95, 282 and E6. On 27 May 2017, routes E5 E7 and E9 passed to Abellio London.\n\nGreenford bus depot is part of a local council depot and was first used in 1993 as a midibus base. The opening of Greenford garage led to the closure of Hanwell, and in 1995 the garage was operating 110 midibuses. The standard fare of vehicles in the late 1990s were Wright bodied Renault midibuses, and Marshall minibuses but both types had a bad reputation and did not last long.\n\nFrom late 2003 until 14 March 2009 Ealing Community Transport operated route 195 from the Greenford depot using garage code EY.\n\nThe garage was first opened on Springfield Road in Hayes before moving to a larger depot at Rigby Lane in early 2016.\n\nOn 11 June 2016, route 195 was transferred from this garage to Greenford (G) garage.\n\nOn 20 August 2016, routes U4 and U5 was transferred to this garage from Uxbridge (UX) garage.\n\nCurrently (July 2017) the garage has no operational routes and is in use for vehicle storage only.\n\nThe original Uxbridge garage was around half a mile out of town on the Oxford Road and was built by the London General Omnibus Company in 1921, but passed to Thames Valley a year later before reverting in 1929 to work its new local routes which were operated mainly by single deckers. An extension was added in the late 1940s and a new garage was planned, although work didn't begin until the 1980s.\n\nThe new garage opened in late 1983 next to the underground station occupying the lower ground floor of a multi use building. In 1989 the garage began operating the U-Line network of local routes using 16 seater Alexander bodied Mercedes-Benz midibuses (MAs) in an initiative by London Transport. The growth of use of the U-Line services over the years since 1989 has meant that larger buses have been put into service on these routes. The garage also operated the busy 207. In 1994, the garage was allocated some of London's first low-floor single deckers, Wright bodied Dennis Lance SLFs with Centrewest branding for the then operated route 222.\n\nOn 20 August 2016, routes U4 and U5 were transferred to Hayes.\n\nOn 3 September 2016, Uxbridge commenced operating route 114.\n\nOn 11 February 2017, route U4 was transferred from Hayes (HZ) garage to this garage.\n\nOn 12 February 2017, route N207 was transferred from Hayes (HZ) garage to this garage.\n\nOn 16 September 2017, Uxbridge commenced operating route 222.\n\nAs of February 2017, Willesden Junction garage operated routes 187, 206, 226, 228 and 295.\n\nNorth Wembley was opened as a midibus base in 1994, and in latter years buses have been gradually been getting longer, although still single deck. North Wembley had basic maintenance facilities, and therefore some maintenance was carried out by Harrow Weald. On 30 May 2009, North Wembley closed.\n\nAs at August 2017, the fleet consisted of 1,682 buses.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2193320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193320", "title": "London United (basketball)", "text": "London United (basketball)\n\nLondon United is basketball team from London, England, currently competing in English Basketball League Division 2. In 2006 they were elected into the professional British Basketball League to replace the London Towers as the sole representatives for the capital city. However, after achieving a Play-off place in their first season, the franchise fell into a financial crisis and withdrew but continued to field a team in the lower leagues of the English Basketball League.\n\nLondon United basketball club was formed in 2002 following a merger between two local teams, the Ealing Tornados and the North London Lords. Ealing Tornados were themselves a very successful team in the lower leagues, having won promotion after promotion since their foundation in 1999. When the merger took place at the end of the 2001–02 season, Ealing Tornados had just finished as runners-up in NBL Division 1 (Now known as EBL Division 2) behind the Derbyshire Arrows.\n\nPlaying as London United, the successes continued with promotion to EBL Division 1 achieved just a year later, in 2003. United spent 3 years in Division 1 with their biggest success coming in 2004-05 when they finished as runners-up, again pipped to the title by the Arrows. The logical progression for the club was to join the fully professional British Basketball League in July 2006. However the decision was hastened when the London Towers withdrew from the 2006-07 season, leaving London without a professional basketball team.\n\nFor owners Jack Majewski and David Schiller, the step-up meant finding a new venue, as well as recruiting more able players and finding corporate investments to fund the venture into the BBL. Jacks first step was to hire coach Tony Garbelotto to control the team on-court and bring in Chris Morris (who works closely with Tony Garbelotto running the highly successful Hackney Community College Basketball Academy programme based at SPACe) to run off-court operations. Majewski, Schiller, Garbelotto and Morris are the Club Directors. Sponsorship soon came, in the way of international money transferers MoneyGram, and a suitable venue was found at the Space Centre near Hackney. A mass influx of British players strengthened the ranks of United, with major signings including internationals Chris Haslam and Tarick Johnson.\n\nLondon played their first BBL game on 30 September 2006 on the road at Leicester Riders. Despite trailing 73–52 at the end of the third quarter, a last gasp effort and a 29–6 run resulted in an 81–79 victory for the rookies. United's successful start to the 2006-07 season continued with another road victory one week later against veterans the Scottish Rocks, who were defeated 76–70. London United finished the 06/07 season qualifying for the BBL Play-Offs in 8th place with an 11/25 record. Here, they were defeated narrowly by BBL Champions Guildford Heat. Tarick Johnson finished as the BBL's top-scorer with over 800pts at an average of 23 per game. Johnson was also voted by BBL coaches into the BBL \"All-Star\" Team of the season.\n\nIt was announced on 5 September 2007, just two weeks prior to the new season tipping-off, that London United's directors and the BBL had agreed to withdraw from the upcoming campaign. The Press Release stated that United's headline sponsor, MoneyGram, had endured financial difficulties of their own and were forced to withdraw their sponsorship. Without enough funds to compete, the club had no option but to 'park' the franchise for a year and work towards a return to the league for 2008–09. Following the shock announcement, the league was promptly reduced to 12 teams for the upcoming season, with rookies London Capital acting as the flagship for London basketball.\n\nHowever, this setback did not wipe out the London United brand from the London basketball landscape. London United Basketball re-established itself at Richmond upon Thames College in order to concentrate on developing young elite basketball players and subsequently joined forces with Spelthorne Atoms Junior Basketball Club to create an extensive Junior Programme under the London United Basketball Club umbrella which enabled the Club to reach all age groups from Under 10s through to Senior Level.\n\nIn the last two years London United won promotion in two consecutive seasons and is now playing in England Basketball League Division Two. On top of this, in 2010 the Men's team also won the National Shield.\n\nNotes:\n\n"}

In 1993, Tasini was the lead plaintiff in the case of \"New York Times Co. v. Tasini\", in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of the copyright claims of writers whose work was republished in electronic databases without their permission. The ruling set an important precedent that lead to a class-action lawsuit settlement of $18 million.

Tasini, who needed to collect 15,000 valid signatures to force a primary with Clinton, submitted approximately 40,000 of them on July 13.\n\nTasini was endorsed by a number of prominent political activists, including Susan Sarandon, Cindy Sheehan, Barbara Ehrenreich, and Howard Zinn. On September 7, 2006, \"Gay City News\" endorsed Tasini's Senate candidacy, citing his support for same-sex marriage, and Clinton's stated opposition to legalizing same-sex marriage. In his campaign, Tasini emphasized his opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and called for universal health care and curbs on corporate power as part of what he termed \"New Rules For the Economy\". He wrote a book called \"It's Not Raining, We're Getting Peed On: The Scam of the Deficit Crisis\" in 2010, voicing his opinions about the current debt crises.\n\nOn May 13, 2010 Tasini announced that he would now be running for Congress, hoping to win the seat held by Charles Rangel, who has been a representative of the 15th district for 17 years.

It is a subsidiary of RATP Group and operates buses under contract to Transport for London. \n\nLondon Sovereign can trace its roots back to independent Borehamwood Travel Services which ran a fleet that included ex-Kelvin Central MCW Metrobuses and Northern Counties Palatines bodied Leyland Olympians and a collection of other vehicles. In 1993 it won its biggest London Buses contract, to operate route 13 with leased AEC Routemasters in its orange livery. In August 1994, Borehamwood Travel Services was sold to the Blazefield Group's Sovereign subsidiary, with the two operations merged as Sovereign London. On 3 November 2002, the business was sold to Transdev, and renamed Transdev London Sovereign.\n\nAfter London United was transferred to RATP as a result of the wider Transdev group's merger with Veolia Transport in March 2011, London Sovereign became Transdev's only London bus company. In March 2014, London Sovereign was sold to RATP and resumed trading as London Sovereign.\n\nLondon Sovereign operate two bus garages.\n\nAs of December 2018, Edgware garage operated routes 79, 139, 142, 251, 258, 288, 303, 326, H12 and 642. \nEdgware garage was first opened by the London General Omnibus Company in 1925 with space for 24 buses, but there was plenty of room adjacent to the Underground station which had recently been built. In 1939 a new building was built next to the original building which was to become the new bus station, while the remaining open parking area was used to store vehicles for the trolleybus replacement program. In 1984 a new 100 bus garage was built on the site of the long closed Edgware railway station at a cost of £4.5 million. In 1992 plans were made to close Edgware garage as Cricklewood garage was to become a fully functioning garage with new facilities. The outdoor parking area and the bus station then became a midibus base in 1993, with a new bus wash and light maintenance facilities provided in the yard.\n\nIn 1999, London Sovereign, having won some tenders for bus services in North-West London, took a 10-year lease on half of Edgware garage and invested in a new maintenance facility which was to replace its former base at Borehamwood. In late 2000, Metroline moved back into the other half of the garage, making it one of the few garages to be shared by two operators. On 25 July 2015 London Sovereign commenced operating route 326.\n\nAs of January 2018, Harrow garage operated routes 183, H9, H10, H11, H13, H14, H18 and H19.\n\nHarrow garage opened in 1994. It is RATP Group's smallest London garage holding just 42 buses. The low roof beam across the middle of the depot building was raised to allow double deckers. The garage has a plot of land next to it, owned by London Sovereign, which is now used to park most of the single decker's due to the 183 allocation, which started on 24 July 2015. The 183 is split between Harrow and Edgware with the majority of buses at Harrow. Route 183 is now fully allocated to Harrow, with routes 398 & H17 transferred to Park Royal (RP) to make room.\nAs at May 2015, the fleet consisted of 152 buses.\n"}

It was a subsidiary of FirstGroup and operated buses under contract to Transport for London. It was formed in the late 1990s through the acquisition of three London bus operators. First London's garages were sold off between December 2007 and June 2013 with the last closing in September 2013.\n\nFirstGroup was formed as FirstBus on 16 May 1995, through the merger of Badgerline and the GRT Group.\n\nAlthough what became First London was established in 1997, FirstBus could trace its involvement in London bus services back to 1990 when Badgerline acquired Eastern National, the Essex-based former National Bus Company subsidiary that had operated numerous routes in East London since tendering began in 1985. These operations were subsequently transferred to a new division, Thamesway Buses, before being recombined with Eastern National in the late 1990s as First Essex.\n\nIn March 1997, FirstBus purchased CentreWest, which had been established in April 1989 as a subsidiary of London Regional Transport before being sold in a management buyout during the privatisation of London bus services in September 1994. Since 1993 CentreWest had been using local identities based on each of its garages, such as \"Ealing Buses\" at Greenford garage and \"Challenger\" at Alperton garage, and in March 1996 it had acquired Southall based London Buslines from the Q-Drive group. All these identities were originally retained, buses receiving new-style fleetnames incorporating FirstBus's corporate \"f\" logo.\n\nIn December 1997, FirstBus rebranded as FirstGroup. Subsequently, CentreWest was renamed First CentreWest, while the buses' fleetnames were revised again so that \"First\" was prominent, the local identities becoming secondary.\n\nOn 8 July 1998, FirstGroup purchased Capital Citybus. It was subsequently renamed First Capital.\n\nIn March 2001, First consolidated the CentreWest and Capital operations under the First London brand. Both were managed from CentreWest's head office beside Paddington station, as was First Berkshire & The Thames Valley, the former Beeline operation that had also been acquired by CentreWest from Q-Drive in 1996. The London Buslines operation was wound down, with its routes, buses and license all being transferred to CentreWest by September 2001.\n\nIn December 2007 the company's Orpington business, which had been established by CentreWest in 1995, was sold to Metrobus, along with 35 buses. In March 2012, Northumberland Park garage was sold to London General.\n\nIn June 2013, FirstGroup sold Alperton, Greenford, Hayes, Uxbridge and Willesden Junction garages with 494 buses to Metroline and Atlas Road (Park Royal), Lea Interchange (Leyton) and Westbourne Park garages with 412 buses to Tower Transit.\n\nFirst London ceased operating on 27 September 2013 after its remaining contracts with Transport for London expired.\n\nAs at March 2013 the fleet consisted of 1,004 buses.\n\nOperated one bus garage in Dagenham.\n\nDagenham garage operated London bus routes 165, 179 and 252, and 24-hour route 365 until 27 September 2013 when their contracts expired. They all passed to Stagecoach London.\n\nPreviously operated a garage in Harold Wood which closed in 2004, and was an outstation of Dagenham.\n\nOn 26 March 2011, First Capital commenced operating route 368.\n\nOn 3 September 2011, First Capital commenced operating routes 608 and 648.\n\nOn 10 March 2012, First Capital commenced operating route 667.\n\nOn 30 March 2012, the Northumberland Park allocation for route 58 was transferred.\n\nOn 22 June 2013, routes 193, 368, 498 plus school routes 608, 646, 648, 652, 656, 667, 679 and 686 passed to Blue Triangle.\n\nOn 17 August 2013, Essex route 265 passed to Amber Coaches.\n\nOperated one bus garage, sold to Tower Transit on 22 June 2013.\n\nLea Interchange garage in Leyton operated London bus routes 26, 30, 58, 236, 308, 339, RV1, W14, W15, 24-hour routes 25, night bus N26 and school route 686.\n\nThe garage opened in 2007 to replace the Waterden Road, Stratford garage that closed as part of the development of the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

In June 2013 Alperton, Greenford, Hayes, Uxbridge and Willesden Junction were sold to Metroline and Atlas Road and Westbourne Park to Tower Transit.\n\nAtlas Road garage in Park Royal operated London bus routes 28, 31, 328, 24-hour route 266 and night routes N28 and N31.\n\nOn 1 October 2011 this depot opened when part of Westbourne Park depot was closed to make way for Crossrail construction with operation of routes 28, 31, 328, N28 and N31 transferred. Atlas Road operated as an outstation for Westbourne Park, so buses were seen on Atlas Road routes and vice versa.\n\nOn 19 May 2012, First London commenced operating route 266.\n\nGreenford garage operated London bus routes 92, 95, 282, E1, E3, E5, E7, E9 and E10.\n\nGreenford bus depot is part of a local council depot and was first used in 1993 as a midibus base. The opening of Greenford garage led to the closure of Hanwell, and in 1995 the garage was operating 110 midibuses. The standard fare of vehicles in the late 1990s were Renault/Wrightbus midibuses, and Marshall minibuses but both types had a bad reputation and did not last long. In recent years the allocation has been much diverse, ranging from Marshall bodied Dennis Darts to Dennis Trident 2/Plaxton vehicles.\n\nFrom late 2003 until 14 March 2009 Ealing Community Transport operated London Buses route 195 from the Greenford depot using garage code EY.\n\nOn 13 November 2010, route 92 was transferred to this garage. On 2 July 2011, route 105 passed to Metroline.\n\nHayes garage operated London bus route 195, 207, 427 and night route N207.\n\nOn 13 November 2010, route 195 was transferred to this garage.\n\nAlperton garage operated London bus routes 223, 224, 245, 487 and 24-hour route 83.\n\nIt was one of three garages built by the LPTB, and the only one to survive, Alperton Garage opened in June 1939, adjacent to the Piccadilly line station of the same name, to serve the extensive local area that had built up in the mid 1930s.\n\nWhen it opened it had an allocation entirely of STL's which were reshuffled from Cricklewood, Hanwell, Harrow Weald, and Willesden garages. As Alperton was a new garage and had plenty of headroom it was one of the few garages able to take utility Guy Arabs, and at one stage these made up its complete allocation and lasted until 1954 when they were replaced by STLs.\n\nBy 1972 with the arrival of numerous AEC MB and SM class single deck buses to operate the numerous one man operation services, and the further allocation of Daimler Fleetline DMS, parking space was becoming a problem. It therefore became necessary to park a dozen or so buses on nearby Glacier Metals' car park overnight. The garage was consequently enlarged between 1976–1978, which encompassed the adjacent former Underground substation, and the London Transport Lifts and Escalators department which had to move out to new premises. During the reconstruction works, 18 vehicles were outstationed at Stonebridge (SE).\n\nThe last RT buses were transferred out in 1975, and until the beginning of the 1980s, Alperton had an entirely AEC Routemaster and Daimler Fleetline allocation. The first MCW Metrobuses arrived in 1981, and gradually replaced the DMS on all the routes, and would become the mainstay of the fleet for many years.\n\nFollowing the September 1982 service reductions, all the remaining RMs were transferred away to other garages, route 187 and 83 became one manned at the same time. Replacement Metrobuses were allocated to make up the allocation mainly used vehicles from Edgware (EW), Hanwell (HL), and Fulwell (FW), making the garage all Metrobus.\n\nBy 1995, Alperton was doing most of the maintenance for the CentreWest operation and had also become the home of the training fleet.\n\nOn 26 November 2011, route 79 passed to Metroline. On 28 April 2012, route 487 was transferred to this garage.\n\nUxbridge garage operated London bus routes 331, 607, A10, U1, U2, U3, U4, U5 and U10.\n\nThe original Uxbridge Garage was around half a mile out of town on the Oxford road and was built by the LGOC in 1921, but passed to Thames Valley a year later. The garage was taken back by the LGOC in 1929 to work its new local routes which were operated mainly by single deckers. An extension was added in the late 1940s and a new garage was planned, although work didn't begin until the 1980s. The new garage came into commission in late 1983 and is situated next to the underground station occupying the lower ground floor of a multi use building. In 1989 the garage began operating the U-Line network of local routes using 16 seater Mercedes Alexander midibuses (MAs) in an initiative by London Transport. The growth of use of the U-Line services over the years since 1989 has meant that larger buses have been put into service on these routes, in particular the U4 which has seen upgrades from MA's to DMLs (older Marshall versions) to the current fleet of double deck TNs. The garage also operated the busy 207 and (since 1991) the express version 607 from Uxbridge to Shepherds Bush (extended to White City Bus Station/Westfield London shopping centre since January 2009). In 1994 the garage was allocated some of London's first low-floor single decker, Dennis Lance SLF/Wright-bodied vehicles with CentreWest branding for the then operated route 222.\n\nWestbourne Park garage operated London bus routes 9 (Heritage), 70 and 24-hour routes 23 and 295.\n\nWestbourne Park Garage was part of the re-construction programme undertaken by London Transport in the early 1980s. As was common practice at the time, the new garage replaced two older garages - the small and inadequate Middle Row (X), and the larger former trolley bus depot at Stonebridge (SE). The new garage, which opened in 1981 in Great Western Road, and is of unusual design in that it is built beneath the elevated A40 Westway, the roof of the garage being profiled to match the concrete flyover. Originally, the garage allocation consisted of AEC Routemasters, and a small number of Daimler Fleetlines to B20 \"quiet\" specification for Route 18. These were supplemented in 1983 by a number of Leyland Titan of T class for comparative trials.\n\nWhen privatised Westbourne Park operated two routes operated by AEC Routemasters, 7 and 23. These were replaced by Dennis Trident 2s in July 2004 and September 2003 respectively. In November 2005 Westbourne Park commenced operating 9 Heritage with Routemasters.\n\nIn November 2000, First CentreWest commenced operating route 27. This passed to London United in November 2005.\n\nIn November 2002, First London commenced operating route 414.

In the past it has also operated in the national rail industry.\nIn 2008 the Group experienced severe trading difficulties which led to a team of corporate finance and restructuring experts from TLT Solicitors advising the ECT Group on a three phase restructuring including the refinancing of the business, the share sale of the recycling division and the share sale of its rail business. The 24 companies in the Group turning over more than £70million and employing 1,100 were reduced to just eight, focused solely on transport.\n\nThe £15.5 million sale of £47 million turnover business 'ECT Recycling' to AIM listed maintenance services contractor May Gurney and the share sale of ECT's rail business to British American Railway Services, a subsidiary of American rail operator Iowa Pacific Holdings, LLC (for an undisclosed sum), meant that the ECT Group returned to its Community Transport roots.\n\nIn early 1995 ECT started its first green box recycling service, using a carton roughly the size of a milk crate, into which paper, glass, cans, foil, textiles, shoes, household batteries and engine oil can be placed, collected once a week by ECT. Materials are sorted into compartments on the recycling vehicle at the kerbside to avoid contamination and mix-up of items. This recycle from home service is now used by 860,000 people in sixteen local authority areas, across parts of London, Avon, Somerset, Warwickshire and the West Midlands.\n\nAs well as doorstep green box recycling, ECT also runs flat recycling services, whereby a block of between 25-125 households has several recycling containers between them, and depots. These depots collect all the materials collected by the doorstep recycling service as well as items such as books, electrical items, fluorescent tubes, fridges, furniture, green waste, plastic waste, scrap metal, tyres, white goods, paint and wood.\n\nECT has developed into a company with an annual turnover of around £50million pounds, with 600 staff working in its recycling, community transport, engineering and refuse collection.\n\nEaling Community Transport was established in the 1970s to serve the small towns on the outskirts of Ealing. Due to a lack of revenue the service was shut down in the late 1990s.\n\nDuring the early 2000s it decreased its frequency to 15 minutes. ECT also experienced problems with vandalism and arson attacks on its buses, and came third from last in the best contractor survey. Initial problems with window etching were quickly addressed and ECT Bus was involved in Operation Eyesore in west London, in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police and TfL, where front-page images on local papers identified local vandals, leading to a number of convictions. Performance of the route was exemplary in terms of operated mileage (before traffic causes) and, despite operating through Southall, an area renowned for its challenging traffic environment, reliability was extremely good - at April 2006, ECT Bus was in second position in TfL's league table for smaller operators. The bus fleet for the 195 contract stood at 14 vehicles.\n\nFrom 14 March 2009 ECT stopped trading as a bus operator and its sole route is now being run by First London on a temporary contract.\n\nECT operated one garage in Greenford, which used to run London Buses route 195. The Greenford bus depot is part of a local council depot and was first used in 1993 as a midibus base. The opening of Greenford garage led to the closure of Hanwell, and in 1995 the garage was operating 110 midibuses. The standard vehicles in the late 1990s were midibuses by Renault/Wright and Marshall but unfortunately both types had a bad reputation and did not last long. In later years the allocation was much more diverse, ranging from Marshall-bodied Darts to Dennis Trident 2/Plaxton vehicles. In late 2003 Ealing Community Transport moved into the depot with their first London route - 195, using garage code EY.\n\n\nECT entered the railway rolling stock hire and maintenance market, owning hire companies RT Rail and Mainline Rail and also RMS Locotec of Wakefield. ECT also operated two heritage railways: the Dartmoor Railway at Okehampton in Devon and the Weardale Railway in County Durham.\n\nBy 2008, the company was pulling out of this area of activity. Mainline Rail ceased to trade, and the Dartmoor Railway was suspended on 18 April 2008 (although services have since been resumed), while ECT was seeking a buyer for its stake in the Weardale line.\n\n"}

{"id": "2193341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193341", "title": "River Crane, London", "text": "River Crane, London\n\nThe River Crane, a tributary of the River Thames, is a river running through west London, England. It is 8.5 miles (13.6 km) long and flows entirely within Greater London. The Crane flows through three London boroughs: Hillingdon, \nHounslow and Richmond upon Thames. Although the drainage basin is heavily urbanised, the Crane Valley is one of the few river corridors within London that provides a continuous belt of semi-natural habitat. However, in common with many urban rivers, the Crane's natural morphology has been significantly altered over the years by river engineering works such as widening, straightening and bank reinforcement.\n\nThe river's source is a point south of North Hyde Road in Hayes, Hillingdon, from where its course is near semi-circular to the south then east, joining the River Thames in two places: on the border of St Margarets with Isleworth and by Riverside Mill and Helene House, Isleworth.\n\nPassing through Cranford, the river crosses Cranford Countryside Park, skirts the eastern side of Heathrow Airport (formerly the Heathrow Heath part of Hounslow Heath) and Hounslow Heath where the (Upper) Duke of Northumberland's River joins the Crane. [This tributary is a distributary of the River Colne and passes along the west and southern perimeter of London Heathrow Airport before joining the Crane]. From this point, the Crane turns gradually east and passes through Crane Park (in Whitton, Twickenham). In Crane Park is the site of the Hounslow Powder Mills which were built in the 16th century and continued to make gunpowder until 1927. The mills have disappeared, but the Shot Tower still stands nearby. The large millpool on an island above the mills is now a Local Nature Reserve, Crane Park Island. The river then turns to the north-east in Twickenham to join the Thames at Isleworth with a distributary splitting off (forming a second section of the Duke's River) running through Kneller Gardens — the Crane itself flows east through Cole Park in Twickenham on the border of St Margarets, where it forms its border with Isleworth. The Duke's River is tidal for the short distance below the weir by the bridge in Church Street, Isleworth, to its confluence with the Thames. Upstream in Isleworth it has been diverted to flow through Mogden Sewage Treatment Works, where it provides coolant for the power station. Treated effluent from the works is not discharged here but is instead piped to the Thames at Isleworth Ait.\n\nThe River Crane is the boundary between the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Hounslow. Around Hanworth and Twickenham, and Isleworth and St. Margarets it is also the boundary between the London boroughs of Hounslow and Richmond.\n\nWhen extending the Piccadilly line from Hounslow West to Heathrow Airport, the high water table of the ground beneath the Crane made it impractical to tunnel under the river channel, so the line rises from tunnels to cross over it.\nIts name is a back-formation from Cranford, London, formerly being called the Cranford River.\n\n\nOn 4 October 2013, a local newspaper web site reported:\n\n\"The Environment Agency (EA) has launched an investigation into a 'pollution incident' at the River Crane in which appeared to have killed many fish. The agency was called into action following several reports from members of the public that a section of the river at Twickenham had turned black and fish were seen in distress.\n\nThe source of the pollution has been traced to an outfall pipe upstream of the A30, and EA officers are at the scene working with partners to minimise the impact of the incident.\"\n\nOn 7 October 2013, there appeared to be a temporary coffer dam with filled sandbags across part of the river, immediately north of the point where the London Underground Piccadilly Line (and four conduits carrying unknown services) crosses the river. A bulk road tanker labelled \"non hazardous product\" was seen with flexible hoses connected to the pool above the dam.\n\nThe Crane Valley Partnership reported that the Environment Agency had traced the source to a fractured main (probably caused by illegal ground works) carrying sewage sludge between the Mogden sewage works and Iver, Buckinghamshire. The escaping sludge found its way into the river via surface water sewers.\n\nIn a previous serious incident on 29–31 October 2011, a large but unknown quantity of raw sewage was deliberately diverted into the Crane. A two-metre valve jammed shut on Saturday morning at Cranford Bridge on the A4 Bath Road while Thames Water engineers carried out routine maintenance. Unable to force the valve back open, they arranged for the backed-up sewage to be taken away in tanker lorries for treatment. The volume of sewage was such that they were unable to remove it fast enough by tanker. Faced with the choice of letting the remaining sewage back up into the airport or spill to the River Crane, they opted for the latter, resulting in sewage entering the river and damaging wildlife. Sewage spilled intermittently into the river until 3am on Monday. This resulted in the death of over 3,000 fish. A full assessment of the damage caused is still ongoing.\n\nThe Crane Valley Partnership (CVP) is the relevant 'Catchment Based Approach' (CaBA) catchment partnership providing the strategic co-ordination of efforts to manage and improve the River Crane and its tributaries, including enhancing biodiversity, water quality and quantity, connectivity, public access, community cohesion, and historical and educational opportunities. The CVP's origins lie with the West London Biodiversity Practitioners Group (WLBPG), derived from the partnership that formed during the work on the Hounslow Local Biodiversity Action Plan (LBAP). The WLBPG held its first meeting on 13 November 2002, at Heathrow's Mayfield Farm classroom. The original members included:\nLondon Borough of Hounslow, London Borough Hillingdon, Groundwork Thames Valley, Syon Park Estate, Thames Water, Heathrow Airport Ltd,\nGlendale/British Airways, English Nature, London Wildlife Trust (LWT), Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB).\nThe main objective of this group was to encourage practical implementation of conservation work across West London. The group met again in February and July 2003. The partnership then evolved to become the River Crane Management Forum (RCMF), which had its first meeting on 15 June 2004. The members present at this meeting were: \nEnvironment Agency (EA), Greater London Authority (GLA), Heathrow Airport Landside Property Services, Glendale for Heathrow Airport Landside Property Services (HALPS), London Borough of Hounslow, London Wildlife Trust, Friends of the River Crane Environment (FORCE), London Borough Hillingdon, London Borough Ealing, A Rocha, WSP for HALPS, Penny Anderson Associates.\nThese organisations had a mutual aspiration for joined-up action along the River Crane to improve water quality and biodiversity, as well as promoting the significance of the river corridor as part of the West London Green Chain. The Forum had another meeting on 20 July 2005, at which point the Crane Valley Partnership (CVP) was established. CVP is currently hosted/chaired by the educational charity Green Corridor. In April 2013, the Partnership appointed a Development Manager who is employed through Green Corridor. This appointment was made possible through funding pledged by Thames Water (£400,000) after the serious pollution incident in 2011 that affected the lower parts of the River Crane.\n\nThe CVP is formed of five London boroughs and public, voluntary and private stakeholders, all working towards a shared vision: for a well-managed and high quality river corridor which is accessible to all, in which wildlife can thrive and local people can take pride and ownership.\n\n\n"}

It is a subsidiary of the Go-Ahead Group and operates services under contract to Transport for London.\n\nLondon Central commenced operating on 1 April 1989 when London Buses was divided into 11 separate business units. In September 1994 it was sold to the Go-Ahead Group. In August 2008, Go-Ahead's London bus operations all adopted the Go-Ahead London trading name, although the individual company names are still applied beneath the logo.\n\nLondon Central operates five bus garages.\n\nAs at December 2019, Bexleyheath garage operated routes 51, 89, 132, 244, 321 (night service only on this 24-hour route), 486, 625, 658, B11 and B16.\n\nBuilt as a trolleybus depot by the London Passenger Transport Board, Bexleyheath was the only new garage built for trolleybuses. The depot is a large and imposing building, slightly set back from the main road to enable parking on the forecourt, which was used as a terminus for route 122. Bexleyheath closed in 1986, with work transferred to Catford, Plumstead and Sidcup garages.\n\nIn 1988 it re-opened under the guise of Bexleybus, a unit set up by London Buses under de-regulation, and had a large and varied allocation from Iveco/Robin Hoods and MCW Metroriders to Leyland Olympians and Daimler Fleetlines. The move to set up the new company to tender for routes backfired, and in the next round of tendering only route B16 was awarded to Bexleybus, whilst London Central won nine.\n\nLondon Central took control of Bexleyheath garage and routes in 1990. Lately the garage has had a good utilisation figure, up to 139 in 2001 which necessitated parking in the rear yard and the forecourt. In January 2007, the garage received its first Alexander Dennis Enviro400s for use on route 486.\n\nThis garage also houses one of the companies iBus hubs, controlling routes for Bexleyheath, Morden Wharf, New Cross, and Peckham garages.\n\nAs at December 2019, New Cross garage operated routes 21, 36, 108, 171, 172, 321 (day time service only), 343, 436, 453, N21, N89, N136, N171 and N343.\n\nSaid to be the largest of London's bus garages with space for over 300 buses, New Cross garage was originally a tram depot and opened in 1906. In 1952 with the trams withdrawn, the depot was converted into a bus garage. The garage has never been even close to its capacity due to the close proximity of other garages, but has at various times been used to store surplus vehicles.\n\nThe garage allocation has fluctuated over the years, from 191 in 1966 to 132 in 2001. The garage also houses some of the private hire fleet which is painted in the style of the former London General company. New Cross was also the garage for two special services, first in 1972 when it operated en ex Tilling ST on route 100 and LPG East Lancs Myllennium bodied DAF SB220s for Millennium Dome services M1 and M2. In 2003 the garage also began operating Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses on route 436. In January 2005 route 36 ceased to be operated by AEC Routemasters with one man operated double deckers taking over.\n\nAs at May 2020, Camberwell garage operated routes 12, 35, 40, 42, 100, 176, 185, 188, 360, 507, 521, 624, 658 and X68. On 30 April 2016, route 345 passed to Abellio London.\n\nAlthough built in 1914, Camberwell garage was not used as a bus garage until 1919 as it had been requisitioned for the war effort. Once it came into use it was one of London's largest garages and also carried out body overhauls in 1940/41. The garage was bombed during World War II in 1940 with four buses being destroyed and 13 seriously damaged.\n\nDuring the early 1950s the garage underwent modernisation with the welfare and operational block reconstructed and the parking area extended. The new building also incorporated a new pit and workshop layout in a separate self-contained block which also undertook heavy maintenance for the adjacent Walworth garage, 350 buses in all.\n\nThe allocation at Camberwell decreased slightly over the years from 165 in 1952 until the closure of Walworth garage in 1985 increased the allocation to 142. Camberwell was also the home of three Leyland Titans fitted with electronic blinds which were used on night bus standby duties.\n\nNew Routemasters were introduced on route 12 from 28 March 2015.\n\nNew Routemasters were introduced on route 68 from 5 February 2016.\n\nAs at May 2020, Peckham garage operated routes 37, 63, 363, N63, P12 and N1.\n\nPeckham garage was converted from a local authority maintenance depot and opened in 1994 with a capacity for 75 buses. In 2000 the garage put London's first Alexander ALX400 bodied Volvo B7TL low-floor vehicles into service on 63. Peckham won bus garage of the year in 2004, although this turned out to be a poisoned chalice for the garage, losing almost half of its work in the next year's tender awards.\n\nAs of December 2019, Morden Wharf garage operated routes 1, 108, 129, 178, 180, 225, 286, 291, 386 and N1.\nOn 29 July 2017 Morden Wharf garage opened in North Greenwich after London General's Mandela Way garage closed, initially operating routes 108, 129, and 286.\n\nAs at December 2019, London Central had a peak vehicle requirement of 676 buses.\n\n"}
{"id": "2193348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193348", "title": "First Essex", "text": "First Essex\n\nFirst Essex is a bus company operating services in the county of Essex. It is a subsidiary of FirstGroup.\n\nFirst Essex arose from an amalgamation of Eastern National and Thamesway Buses. First Essex was originally part of the Eastern National Omnibus Company, founded in 1929, nationalised in 1949 and privatised in a management buyout in October 1986. In 1990, Eastern National was sold to Badgerline (who became part of FirstGroup in 1995) and split - the depots in North Essex continuing to operate as Eastern National and those in South Essex being transferred to a new division, Thamesway. Both were later amalgamated again and rebranded First Essex.\n\nFirst Essex was criticised by passengers and members of the Southend Area Bus Users' Group for withdrawing services which it considered no longer economically viable when Southend Borough Council withdrew bus subsidies as part of budget cuts in 2005. First said it was due to low passenger numbers, even when parts of the route were profitable. Further criticism came from passengers when First Essex and Arriva Southend decided to withdraw their \"Day Rover\" ticket, which allowed unlimited journeys on the day of purchase on buses operated by both companies, regardless of which company issued the ticket, so that day tickets could only be used on the buses of the company that issued them. They replaced it with a more expensive \"Octopus\" ticket, issued by and can be used on any buses operated by companies running in the general Southend area.\n\nFirst Essex operates four bus depots in the city of Chelmsford and towns of Basildon, Colchester and Hadleigh. The outstation at Great Dunmow has closed, with services transferring to Chelmsford depot. The Harwich Depot was closed in late 2013, all of its services are now run by the Clacton and Colchester depots. The Braintree depot was closed in late 2015. All of its services are now either run by Stephensons of Essex (21, 30, 131, 132 (converted to 38/38A respectively), or by the Chelmsford Depot (70, 352)\n\nBasildon garage operates routes 5/A/B/X, 8/A, 9/A, 10, X10 ESSEX airlink, 16, 21 (Saturdays Only), 25, 94/A/B, 100, 251, and school services 561/A, 625, 725, and the 825.\n\nBasildon depot is on Cherrydown East. It was opened by Eastern National in 1961 to replace premises at Bull Road, Vange.\n\nAfter Brentwood depot closed in 1995, Basildon ran the Brentwood town services until 1998 when Harold Wood depot took over. When First London took over Harold Wood in 2004, Basildon again took on the Brentwood town services until 2012 when Chelmsford took over the Brentwood services with the 351 and 73 (Basildon taking the 551 turning it into the 9).\n\nChelmsford depot operates Chelmsford Park and Ride, routes 13/13A, 14, X30 ESSEX airlink, 31/B/C/D/X, 32, 36/A/B/X, 37, 40, 42/A/B, 45/A/C, 46, 47, 51, 54/A/C 56/A/B/C 57/A/B/C, 70, 71/A/B/C/D/X, 73/A, 80A/C, 94C/D, 351, 565 and School Bus services 525, 570, 620\n\n37, 80A/C and 565 are Brentwood town services.\n\nWhen the old Chelmsford Duke Street bus depot/bus station was redeveloped in autumn 2004, operations moved to a new site at Westway. The new, much reduced, Duke Street bus station opened in March 2007.\n\nChelmsford had outstations at Great Dunmow and Maldon until 2004. Maldon had been a full depot until 1993.\n\nOn 20 October 2013, Chelmsford took over the operation of route 888 Luton Airport shuttle from First Northampton.\n\nColchester depot operates routes 1A (Sundays & Evenings), 2A (Sundays & Evenings), 17 (School Days), 61, 62/A/B, 64/A, 65, 66/B, 67, 68, 70(Some journeys), 71/X(some journeys), 75/75A, 88/A/B, 99, 100, 102, 103, 104, 106, 174 & 175\n\nThe garage in Quayside is the main garage in Colchester. It was built in 2016 to replace the old garage on Queen Street which was on the site of the Theatre Royal, burnt down circa 1917. Buses were kept in the old Colchester Corporation tram shed at Magdalen Street after it was vacated by Network Colchester in 2006. This ceased in July 2009 when the yard next door was used instead, also previously occupied by Network Colchester. First had another Colchester site at Haven Road, which was mainly used for engineering. This has since been bought by a local company that is not transport orientated, but then in 2015 First demolished the old timber yard [its former use] and built a new bus garage.\n\nUntil 1973, Eastern National had a one bus outstation at West Mersea, acquired from Primrose Bus Service in 1935. The building there survives, but in 1979 it was heavily modified, to become part of a new leisure centre. Service buses still terminate outside, and locals still refer to it as West Mersea bus station.\n\nUntil 1969, Eastern National also had a one bus outstation in Victoria Place, Brightlingsea. This was acquired with the business of Berry & Sons in 1937.\n\nHadleigh garage operates routes: 20, 21/B, 22, 25(Few Workings Sat), 26, 27/A/X, 28 and school services 820, 821, 822 and 827\n\nHadleigh garage is located on London Road, just west of Hadleigh shopping centre. It is a former Westcliff on Sea Motor Services depot, controlled by Eastern National from 1955.\n\nHadleigh took on the work of Canvey (CY) depot in April 1978. Canvey has since become a transport museum.\n\nHadleigh further expanded its operations in 1992, after Southend (Prittlewell) (PL) depot was closed. The predecessor of Prittlewell, Southend (SD) depot on London Road, closed in 1987, and has now disappeared under a Sainsbury's store.\n\nBraintree garage operated routes X32, 17, 21/A, 30, 70, 131, 132, 302, 306, 318, 347, and Yellow School Bus service 509.\n\nThe former depot, on Springwood Drive, opened in April 2005. It replaced the long-standing premises on Fairfield Road, in Braintree town centre, which was redeveloped for retail/residential use.\n\nSpringwood Drive was originally an outstation of Chelmsford, consisting of a secure yard and portakabin. There were vehicle washing facilities and fuelling but heavy maintenance was done at Chelmsford. The portakabin had previously been at Maldon outstation (closed 2004).\n\nIn 2009, First re-opened a full depot in Braintree, behind the secure yard in Springwood Drive. This contained washing/fuelling facilities and heavy maintenance facilities, while the Secure Yard now houses the 'reserve' fleet.\n\nFairfield Road had originally been used by Hicks Brothers, a bus operator which Eastern National took over in 1949.

Telford Road replaced the garage at Castle Road, near Clacton town centre, which was redeveloped as flats.\n\nThere was an outstation of Clacton at Walton-on-the-Naze, until May 1996. This was a small garage at Kino Road, just off the seafront, and housed 4 vehicles. Walton had the depot code of WN. Walton garage was demolished in 1998, with bungalows built on the site. However the enquiry office survives, as a gift shop.\n\nThe predecessor of Walton garage was Warners Iron Foundry at Naze Park Road, a building stands to this day.\nThis had its origins with Silver Queen.\n\nThe depot closed on Saturday 28 July 2018.\n\nThis outstation operated route 33.\n\nDunmow was an outstation of Braintree.

It was then retained as an accredited operator to operate services in the event of their contracted operator being unable to do so. In August 2002 it was called in to operate routes 42 and 185 following the collapse of London Easylink.\n\nOn 3 October 2009 Transport for London sold East Thames Buses to the Go-Ahead Group who incorporated it into its London General.\n\nWhen it was formed, East Thames Buses operated from the former London Forest and Kentish Bus Ash Grove bus garage and Harris's Belvedere Garage. On 13 October 2005 Ash Grove was vacated and operations transferred to Mandela Way, Southwark.\n\nMandela Way opened in late 2005 following the relocation from the existing base at Ash Grove.

He was the son of John M. James (1775-1827) and Mary \"Polly\" James (née Poor, 1790-1827). His grandfather, William James (1754-1805), came to Goochland County, Virginia, from Pembrokeshire, Wales, in the late 18th century. Through his mother Robert was also a descendant of Jamestowne Society qualifying ancestor Dr. John Woodson. Woodson, an Oxford-educated surgeon, arrived at Jamestown, Virginia in April 1619 from Devon in the service of Colony of Virginia Governor George Yeardley. Robert's maternal grandfather Robert Poor served as a Cornet (military rank) in the Revolutionary War.\n\nRobert married Zerelda Cole on December 28, 1841. His children were Alexander Franklin, Robert, Jesse and Susan Lavenia. He attended Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky, graduating in 1843 with honors and a Bachelor of Arts. The family soon relocated to Clay County, Missouri, where Zerelda's mother and stepfather were living, but Robert commuted back to Kentucky and eventually received a Master of Arts from Georgetown. He was considered a gifted student and a skilled orator.\n\nJames was a noted revivalist. He was among the founders of William Jewell College in 1849. In April 1850, James left his family for California to visit his brother Drury Woodson James, who had already relocated to the state. He also planned to prospect for gold and preach to the crowds of goldminers during the California gold rush. Shortly after arriving in California in August 1850, he contracted cholera and died on August 18, 1850, in the Hangtown Gold Camp, later known as Placerville. He was buried there in an unmarked grave. Probate records show that at his death he owned six slaves and was a commercial hemp farmer.\n\nJames's death left his family saddled with debts and many of his possessions, including one of the slaves, were auctioned off to pay them. His widow Zerelda married Benjamin Simms, a wealthy farmer, on September 30, 1852. This, however, did not last and they soon separated.\n"}
{"id": "2193361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193361", "title": "Nefta, Tunisia", "text": "Nefta, Tunisia\n\nNefta (or Nafta; ) is a Tunisian municipality and an oasis in Tozeur Governorate north of the Chott el Djerid.\n\nNefta is considered by most Sufis to be the spiritual home of Sufism, a mystical branch of Islam; many religious buildings are located in the district El Bayadha. Nefta is a pilgrimage center to which pilgrims travel throughout the year. There is a Folk Festival in April and a Date Festival in November/December.\n\nNefta is the religious center of the Bled el Djerid, the \"Land of Palms\", with more than 24 mosques and 100 marabouts. The marabouts still attract pilgrims from all over southern Tunisia and even from Algeria. This great veneration of the marabouts reflects the continuing vigor of Sufism, the movement which grew up in the 12th century around Sufi Abu Madian (d. 1197). The name of the Sufis came from the simple woolen garment (suf) they wore. They believed that the adherents of Islam, a religion of the desert, should show particular modesty of behavior and asceticism, and were much given to mysticism, the veneration of holy men, spiritual contemplation and meditation. Sufism is also marked by religious forms taken over from the pre-Islamic, animistic religions of the Berber population which orthodox Islam seeks to repress - belief in spirits, witchcraft, fortune-telling, the efficacy of amulets, etc. Regional variants of Sufism were propagated by holy men, who frequently founded their own brotherhoods, with centers for the teaching of disciples. They are credited with numerous miracles and revered for their holiness, and their tombs (marabouts) are places of pilgrimage, attracting varying numbers of pilgrims according to their reputation. In the past these holy men were also appealed to as judges in the conflicts which frequently occurred between the nomadic tribes and the settled population of the oases. Nefta is the last stronghold of this Sufism, and is sometimes called, with some justification, the \"Kairouan of the South\". The marabouts venerated here are scattered about throughout the old town of Nefta and the oasis.\n\nDuring the Roman Empire the town then known as Nefte was the seat of a Christian bishopric, which functioned till the end of the 7th century.\n\nNefta is divided into two parts by a small oued and a depression at its northern end. To the east of the oued is the new town, with the old souk quarter at its southwestern corner; to the west, on the slopes of a hill, is the old town. The main road from Tozeur runs through the new town as Avenue Habib Bourguiba, which then crosses the oued and skirts the old town. At its western end a street branches off on the right, ascends the hill, goes round the old town and the sand-bowl, and returns to Avenue Habib Bourguiba. Nefta is a town of cube-shaped, flat-roofed houses huddled closely together, with Tozeur-style decoration. In some of the streets the upper stories of the houses, borne on round- headed arches, project over the street, forming a kind of tunnel which offers protection from the sun. It is planned to restore the old town in the very near future.\n\nNefta is believed to have been settled originally by shepherds who came from the kingdom of Napata. The Romans and later the Byzantines built forts in the oasis (Nepte) to provide protection against raids by desert nomads. In Byzantine times Nefta and Tozeur were episcopal sees. In the mid-7th century Nefta was conquered by the Arabs and, in spite of fierce resistance, converted to Islam. A Christian community was however recorded as late as 1194\n\nIn subsequent centuries Nefta prospered as an important staging-point for caravans (for a time the most important in Tunisia). Its decline began in the 15th century as a result of more frequent raids by nomadic tribes and the general falling off in the caravan trade. With the coming of the French in 1881, however, Nefta experienced a renewal.\n\nThe salt-flats near Nefta were used as a filming location for the Star Wars saga in the late 20th century.\n\n\nNefta lies on GP 3 (Gafsa–Nefta), 25 km southwest of Tozeur (airport; regular services to and from Tunis, Monastir, and Djerba) and 113 km southwest of Gafsa. From the bus station (Gare Routière) in Avenue Habib Bourguiba, there are regular bus services to Tozeur and Gafsa and a once-daily service to Douz and Hazaoua, the frontier post for the crossing into Algeria. The 4 km from there to the frontier must be done either on foot or in a louage (communal taxi). From the Algerian frontier post there are buses to El Oued.\n\n"}
{"id": "2193362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193362", "title": "Chromophore", "text": "Chromophore\n\nA chromophore is the part of a molecule responsible for its color.\nThe color that is seen by our eyes is the one not absorbed within a certain wavelength spectrum of visible light. The chromophore is a region in the molecule where the energy difference between two separate molecular orbitals falls within the range of the visible spectrum. Visible light that hits the chromophore can thus be absorbed by exciting an electron from its ground state into an excited state. In biological molecules that serve to capture or detect light energy, the chromophore is the moiety that causes a conformational change of the molecule when hit by light.\n\nJust like how two adjacent p-orbitals in a molecule will form a pi-bond, three or more adjacent p-orbitals in a molecule can form a conjugated pi-system. In a conjugated pi-system, electrons are able to capture certain photons as the electrons resonate along a certain distance of p-orbitals - similar to how a radio antenna detects photons along its length. Typically, the more conjugated (longer) the pi-system is, the longer the wavelength of photon can be captured. In other words, with every added adjacent double bond we see in a molecule diagram, we can predict the system will be progressively more likely to appear yellow to our eyes as it is less likely to absorb yellow light and more likely to absorb red light. (\"Conjugated systems of fewer than eight conjugated double bonds absorb only in the ultraviolet region and are colorless to the human eye\", \"Compounds that are blue or green typically do not rely on conjugated double bonds alone.\")\n\nIn the conjugated chromophores, the electrons jump between energy levels that are extended pi orbitals, created by a series of alternating single and double bonds, often in aromatic systems. Common examples include retinal (used in the eye to detect light), various food colorings, fabric dyes (azo compounds), pH indicators, lycopene, β-carotene, and anthocyanins. Various factors in a chromophore's structure go into determining at what wavelength region in a spectrum the chromophore will absorb. Lengthening or extending a conjugated system with more unsaturated (multiple) bonds in a molecule will tend to shift absorption to longer wavelengths. Woodward–Fieser rules can be used to approximate ultraviolet-visible maximum absorption wavelength in organic compounds with conjugated pi-bond systems.\n\nSome of these are metal complex chromophores, which contain a metal in a coordination complex with ligands. Examples are chlorophyll, which is used by plants for photosynthesis and hemoglobin, the oxygen transporter in the blood of vertebrate animals. In these two examples, a metal is complexed at the center of a tetrapyrrole macrocycle ring: the metal being iron in the heme group (iron in a porphyrin ring) of hemoglobin, or magnesium complexed in a chlorin-type ring in the case of chlorophyll. The highly conjugated pi-bonding system of the macrocycle ring absorbs visible light. The nature of the central metal can also influence the absorption spectrum of the metal-macrocycle complex or properties such as excited state lifetime. The tetrapyrrole moiety in organic compounds which is not macrocyclic but still has a conjugated pi-bond system still acts as a chromophore. Examples of such compounds include bilirubin and urobilin, which exhibit a yellow color.\n\nAn auxochrome is a functional group of atoms attached to the chromophore which modifies the ability of the chromophore to absorb light, altering the wavelength or intensity of the absorption.\n\nHalochromism occurs when a substance changes color as the pH changes. This is a property of pH indicators, whose molecular structure changes upon certain changes in the surrounding pH. This change in structure affects a chromophore in the pH indicator molecule. For example, phenolphthalein is a pH indicator whose structure changes as pH changes as shown in the following table:\n\nIn a pH range of about 0-8, the molecule has three aromatic rings all bonded to a tetrahedral sp hybridized carbon atom in the middle which does not make the π-bonding in the aromatic rings conjugate. Because of their limited extent, the aromatic rings only absorb light in the ultraviolet region, and so the compound appears colorless in the 0-8 pH range. However, as the pH increases beyond 8.2, that central carbon becomes part of a double bond becoming sp hybridized and leaving a p orbital to overlap with the π-bonding in the rings. This makes the three rings conjugate together to form an extended chromophore absorbing longer wavelength visible light to show a fuchsia color. At pH ranges outside 0-12, other molecular structure changes result in other color changes; see Phenolphthalein details.\n\n \n\n"}

She was appointed to the Privy Council in 1949.\n\nSummerskill was educated at King's College London and was admitted to medical school at Charing Cross Hospital Medical School, one of the earliest women to be admitted to medical school. She was one of the founders of the Socialist Health Association which spearheaded the National Health Service (1948). She pressed for equal rights for women in the British Home Guard. In 1938, she initiated the Married Women's Association to promote equality in marriage and became its first president.\n\nSummerskill entered politics at 32 when she was asked to fight the Green Lanes ward in Harringay in the Middlesex County Council elections. She then served as a councillor on Middlesex County Council from 1934 until 1941. She stood for a seat in the House of Commons unsuccessfully at the Putney byelection in 1934 and Bury at the 1935 general election, before becoming Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Fulham West at a by-election in 1938 thanks to the working women's vote. She caused some disquiet by taking the seat in her maiden name. When the Fulham West constituency was abolished for the 1955 general election, she was returned to the House of Commons as MP for Warrington.\n\nSummerskill was included in Clement Attlee's Labour government following the election victory in 1945. She served as a Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Food, and was later promoted to the Ministry of Social and National Insurance, heading the department she was profiled as the Minister of National Insurance, however she was not a cabinet minister.\n\nAs well as her service in government, Summerskill also served on the House of Commons Political Honours Scrutiny Committee from 1967 to 1976.\n\nSummerskill served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food (1945–50) and as Minister of National Insurance (1950–51). She was a member of the Labour Party's National Executive Committee from 1944 to 1958 and served as Chair of the Labour Party 1954-5). She left the House of Commons in 1961 and was created a life peer as Baroness Summerskill, \"of Ken Wood in the County of London\" on 4 February 1961. Furthermore, she was awarded an additional honour being initiated into the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in 1966.\n\nSummerskill appears in a specially selected list of Fabian Society members from 1942 to 1947, showing continuity and prestige. An active feminist, she was instrumental in promoting women's causes throughout that period, starting with the Clean Milk Act in 1949. Later, as the president of the Married Women's Association, she campaigned in and outside the parliament to assure the equal rights of housewives and of divorced women, which resulted in the Married Women's Properties Act in 1964 and the Matrimonial Homes Act in 1967.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Summerskill wrote a series of letters to her daughter Shirley, who, like her mother, was an active feminist. Shirley studied medicine in Oxford at that time and later became a doctor and a Member of Parliament and of Cabinet. Edith Summerskill's letters to Shirley were collected and published in a book \"Letters to My Daughter\" (1957). Summerskill outlines her belief that women are superior to men in almost every way. In support of such a theory Summerskill presents three \"facts\": firstly, that only women can enjoy two worlds of creative enterprise the biological and the intellectual. Secondly she suggests women are physically stronger, live longer are constitutionally tougher, having greater stamina. Finally she believes women have equal if not greater intellect than men.\n\nAlthough Summerskill's book contains only Edith's letters to her daughter, the mother's response to questions raised by the daughter creates a sense of an ongoing dialogue between the two, concerning issues of education for women, equality and achievements. In reply to Shirley's question about the part that married women are playing in the affairs of the country, her mother writes:\n\n\"The insistent demand of women for recognition in spheres of work outside the home, which has quietly but unremittingly been advanced in the course of the last hundred years, has grudgingly been conceded. As a doctor and a Member of Parliament I am fully conscious of the fact that the doors both of the medical schools and of the House of Commons had to be forced by furious and frustrated women before their claims were recognized. It would be quite inaccurate to suggest that we were welcomed into the universities or into public life.\"(143)\nSummerskill constantly struggles for and raises consciousness about women's equal rights. In response to Shirley's complaint about \"the stock question\" of the anti-feminists, \"Why have not more women achieved eminence in the arts and sciences?\" She answers: \"Personally I am astounded that so many have distinguished themselves despite the conditions which society has imposed upon them\" (181). Summerskill maintains that in spite of the difficulties and prejudices, women are making progress and have achievements in music, visual art, and literature as well as some advancement in science and technology (181). Yet Summerskill's conclusion in 1956 is similar to the one Virginia Woolf reached twenty-five years earlier. Woolf claims that even when all the outward obstacles are overcome, she, or any other a woman, has not solved the problem of \"my own experiences as a body\" (1942: 206); Edith Summeskill makes the parallel concession that for a woman, the \"most powerful force, which takes her off the course\" is the \"biological urge to have a family\" (187).\n\nSummerskill was married in 1925 to Dr Jeffrey Samuel. Their children took their mother's surname. Her daughter, Shirley Summerskill, also served as a physician, member of parliament and government minister. Her grandson Ben Summerskill became Chief Executive of the British gay equality charity Stonewall in 2003.\n\n\n"}

Cisyk, a classically trained opera singer, achieved success in four musical genres: popular music, classical opera, Ukrainian folk music and commercial jingles for radio and TV advertisements.\n\nCisyk recorded the version of \"You Light Up My Life\" heard in the movie (Oscar and Golden Globe Awards win in 1978), sang the \"Have you driven a Ford lately?\" and \"You deserve a break today!\" jingles, and released two critically acclaimed albums of Ukrainian songs.\n\nCisyk was the daughter of two Ukrainian immigrants; her given name, Kvitka, is Ukrainian for \"flower\". Her father, Volodymyr Cisyk, a well known Ukrainian concert violinist and teacher, taught his daughter the violin when she was five years old, grooming her for a career as a classical musician.\n\nCisyk attended the High School of Music & Art in New York City and graduated in 1970. She attended Harpur College, also known as SUNY Binghamton, for one year directly after high school. Her sister taught piano there. In the summer of 1971, she attended a SUNY-sponsored opera program in Ghent, Belgium. She received a violin scholarship to the Mannes College of Music, but had switched to classical voice training by the time of her graduation.\n\nCisyk's original goal was a career as an opera singer, but her father's death left the family without a source of income. Needing to earn money immediately, Cisyk pursued a career as a session singer in popular music. She drew her professional name (Kasey) from her first and last initials.\n\nCisyk began singing in clubs, while submitting audition tapes to producers and advertising agencies. She had a successful career as a background singer in popular music, working as a backup singer for Carly Simon and Michael Franks and for artists produced by Quincy Jones.\n\nCisyk achieved her widest success as a singer of the musical jingles used in TV and radio commercials. Cisyk's recording of the slogan \"Have you driven a Ford lately?\" was used in Ford commercials from 1981 to 1998; in 1989, Ford executives estimated that Cisyk's recording of that phrase had been heard by 20 billion people.\n\nDuring a career that lasted more than twenty years, Cisyk had skills so highly valued that competitors within the same industry sought her services. She sang the phrase \"You deserve a break today\" for McDonald's, but also recorded commercials for Burger King.\n\nIn addition to Ford, Cisyk sang for automakers General Motors and Toyota. She recorded spots for the three national television networks in the 1980s (ABC, NBC and CBS), four major airlines (American, Delta, Eastern and TWA), two national retailers Sears and JC Penney and the two most popular soft drinks: Coca-Cola and Pepsi.\n\nAccording to her \"New York Times\" obituary, \"a typical day, she later recalled, would begin with a 9 am session for Trans World Airlines, followed by Coca-Cola at eleven, Hartz Mountain at 1 pm, Eastern Airlines at two, Datsun at three, L'Eggs at five, McDonald's at six, and, after all that, a recording session from 8:30 pm to 3 am\"\n\nCisyk's list of commercial credits also include Mr. Pibb, Safeway grocery stores, and Starburst candies.\n\nCisyk's work in commercials brought her to the attention of Joe Brooks, who worked as a composer and arranger of jingles. Brooks, who wrote, directed and composed the score for the movie \"You Light Up My Life\" chose Cisyk to dub the singing voice of actress Didi Conn.\n\nCisyk's performance of the song appears on the original soundtrack album, and was released as a single, although she was not listed as the performing artist in the final credits of the film (for which she successfully sued the producers). Her single release of the song reached No. 80 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 charts.\n\nThe song was also recorded by singer Debby Boone, with Brooks producing and arranging. This recording of \"You Light Up My Life\", became a No. 1 single on the \"Billboard\" chart for ten consecutive weeks. People magazine ran a substantial article about \"The real voice behind 'You Light Up My Life\" inasmuch the similarity between her and Debby Boone's voice led many to assume the latter had sung the songs in the movie. In a 2013 biographical essay about Cisyk, Cisyk's second husband, Ed Rakowicz wrote, that Brooks \"withheld payment ... tried to evade payment by false promises and by asking her to be an incidental actor in his film, implying huge rewards yet to come...\" Later, (according to Rakowicz's biographical essay), Brooks made improper advances toward Cisyk, and after being rebuffed, didn't speak directly to her again, and continued to evade payments to her. Rakowicz writes, \"[Kasey] retained a lawyer and sued Brooks for the fees she earned for her work on the record and the film but accepted an award of a small sum just to relieve herself of the torment of a prolonged legal battle with Brooks.\" Later in 2009 Joseph Brooks, became the subject of an investigation after being accused of a series of casting-couch rapes. He was indicted in May 2009 by the state Supreme Court for Manhattan (a trial-level court) on 91 counts of rape, sexual abuse, criminal sexual act, assault, and other charges. While awaiting trial, Brooks killed himself in May, 2011.\n\nCisyk also recorded lead vocals for the soundtracks of the movies \"The One and Only\" and \"Circle of Two\". She also contributed backing vocals to the Carly Simon songs used on the soundtrack for the movie \"Working Girl\".\n\nAs the daughter of Ukrainian immigrants, Cisyk was raised with Ukrainian music, and she is well known in the Ukrainian-speaking world for her two albums of Ukrainian songs. According to Cisyk she recorded these albums because her colleagues often asked her to \"show them something Ukrainian, but there were no records worthy of being shown\".\n\nIn 1980 she recorded her first album, \"Kvitka, Songs of Ukraine\" which won top honors in the 1988 Ukrainian Music Awards.\n\nHer second album, \"Kvitka, Two Colors\", was released in 1989. was dedicated to \"the spirit of the Ukrainian soul, whose wings can never be broken.\" Today, songs from both albums continue to be heard on radio in Ukraine.\n\nBoth albums were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album.\n\nBoth \"Songs of Ukraine\" and \"Two Colors\" were family projects. Cisyk's second husband, Ed Rakowicz, a recording engineer, produced them; her first husband, Jack Cortner arranged and conducted them. Her sister, Maria Cisyk, a concert pianist and teacher, performed the solo piano selections on the record, and her mother, Ivanna, made sure her Ukrainian pronunciation was perfect.\n\nKvitka Cisyk Rakowicz died from breast cancer on March 29, 1998, six days before her 45th birthday.\n\nBecause of her contribution to Ukrainian music a yearly music festival is held and a street was named for her in Lviv, Ukraine.\n\nFor the singer’s 60th birthday anniversary Ukrainian Inter TV channel made a documentary film \"Kvitka. Single copy voice\". The film authors have investigated the phenomenon of the singer with the help of her relatives and close friends: husband Ed Rakowicz, son Eddie, family from Lviv and the United States, workmates and fans. On April 4, 2013 premieres of the film took place in Kiev, Lviv, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, Odessa, Luhansk and Chernivtsi. The film was released on Inter TV channel on April 5, 2013.\n\n\n"}

Among his many innovations and timekeeping improvements, Simon Willard is best known for inventing the eight-day patent timepiece that came to be known as the gallery or banjo clock.\n\nSimon Willard was of the fifth Willard generation in America. The original Willard family had arrived in 1634 from Horsmonden, Kent (England), and they were among the founders of Concord, Massachusetts. Simon Willard's parents were Benjamin Willard and Sarah Brooks, who were Grafton natives. Like all of the Willard brothers, Simon was born on the family farm in Grafton, on April 3, 1753. He was the second son; his brothers were Benjamin, Aaron, and Ephraim.\n\nThe farm, now operated as the Willard House and Clock Museum, had been built in 1718 by the Willards' third American generation. When Simon Willard was born, the house had just one room. The elder brother, Benjamin, who was 10 years older than Simon, learned horology and opened a workshop adjacent to the house in 1766. It is presumed that the other Willard brothers were taught horology by Benjamin.\n\nAt the age of eleven Simon began to study horology, showing some inherent aptitude for it. A year later, Benjamin hired an Englishman named Morris to teach horology—particularly to Simon. Years afterward, Simon revealed that Morris did not actually know much on the matter and that his brother Benjamin had been his actual mentor. After one more year, Simon built his first tall clock.\n\nLike some other contemporary horologists, the Willards divided their lives between farm chores and the clock business. As the latter became profitable, Benjamin set up a workshop in Lexington, Massachusetts, in 1767. Simon Willard managed his own business in Grafton; some clocks survive bearing the maker's mark \"Simon Willard, Grafton.\"\n\nAt his workshop in Grafton, Willard studied the clocks by other makers which were brought to him to be repaired. He extensively experimented, seeking to improve the efficiency of the driving and the regulation parts of those timepieces' parts. The smallest clock of the time was the bracket clock, which influenced Simon's gallery clock, which he patented in 1802. His next creation was the shelf clock, which was based on his gallery clock.\n\nIn about 1780, Simon Willard moved to 2196 Roxbury Street in Boston (later known as Washington Street), and set up a four-room workshop on his own. Soon thereafter, his brother Aaron settled in the same neighborhood, a quarter mile away. In 1784, Willard advertised: \"Simon Willard opened a shop in Roxbury Street, nearly facing the road which turns off to Plymouth. There, Simon Willard carries on the clockmaking business, in all its branches.\" Like Aaron, Simon was still interested in perfecting the mechanism of compact clocks. Nonetheless, from the 1790s onward, Willard's workshop also built tall clocks in great numbers while also performing general clock repair.\n\nSimon and Aaron Willard both combined 18th century knowledge of horology with then-contemporary industrial methods (pre-cast parts, template usage, labor division, standardized production, efficient management). Simon and Aaron Willard each developed an industrial zone, throughout a quarter-mile radius around their shops. By 1807, twenty factories in Boston were sub-contracted to supply parts or materials to the Willard brothers' businesses. This included mahogany (from nearby mills), clock parts (amongst which 20 cabinetmakers were), gilder works, and other important artistic resources. Both Willard brothers utilized the same suppliers and often even shared the same workers.\n\nSince the early United States lacked vital raw materials—most particularly brass—most clockmakers either fabricated their movements from wood or other inferior materials, or they imported parts and entire movements from English suppliers and assembled them into the locally-produced mahogany clock cases. By their quality, the clocks of Boston became a status symbol. Americans were eager to buy clocks for parlors, offices, churches, or other public spaces. Simon Willard's clocks were the most famous in America. However, they were still too expensive for most people. Indeed, Simon Willard preferred to build sumptuous models that featured elaborate artistic details (especially brass trim).\n\nSimon Willard's clocks required considerable skilled handcraftsmanship, and their movements were outstandingly precise. His own skills were considerable, and he was able to file cogwheels without leaving file-marks, producing mechanisms with a margin of error of just thirty seconds over the course of a month. By about 1810, both Simon and Aaron were producing clocks which as good as those being produced in Europe. Simon's workshop produced fewer clocks than did Aaron's, and today the higher prices that Simon's clocks reach at auction reflect their superior refinement.\n\nSimon Willard personally interviewed his customers, evaluating each detail, and he ordered his technicians to extensively test each movement in the customer's own home. Into each clock, Simon included a brochure, instructions, and a written guarantee. Any necessary technical support was included with the timepiece's purchase. Although Simon knew little about advertising, he promoted his workshop through leaflets which were affixed inside the cases. He touted: \"These clocks are made in the best manner. They run for a year and they don't wind up. We will give evidence that it is much cheaper to buy new clocks than to buy old or second hand clocks. Simon Willard warrants all his clocks.\" Nonetheless, over the years his maker's signature has occasionally become lost or obscured from his clocks.\n\nSimon Willard built longcase clocks which were quite sumptuous, being adorned with many fine details.\n\nIn the most expensive tall clock units, the mahogany cases had a mid-18th century English style and, bearing exactly similar English brass mechanisms all, their case complexity determined their final price. Distinctively for Willard's workshop, above the clock's top fretwork, three pedestals were, on which two spherical finials and a large bird figure were mounted. In addition, like Aaron, Simon built a glass dial door, whose top had a half arch shape. Onto the dial, Boston painters painted different motifs. Also, with few extra mechanism, amusing wheels with animated figures were featured on the dial, enticing the customer interest effectively.\n\nDuring his career, Willard manufactured 1,200 tall models. However, after 1802, in which the gallery clock was finally patented, he spurned the manufacture of the tall clock, which was thereafter produced only by special commission.\n\nSimon Willard invented the Patent Timepiece, later called the \"banjo\" clock, at Roxbury. It was America's first commercially successful wall clock. It was an innovative design. It was the first American eight-day wall clock, the first American wallclock to have the pendulum suspended in front of the weight in the case, and the first American wallclock to have the weight attached to a pulley. The brass clock mechanism was reduced to a much smaller size, therefore saving brass which was in scarce supply in the early 19th century. Its shape was an imitation of the traditional wheel barometers. Early Patent Timepieces were built by hand, to order. By 1805 the clockworks, and standard cases, could be produced in quantity, reducing the cost of the clock.\n\nIts small size meant a much lower price of 30 dollars, although this was still a large amount of money. Nonetheless, while American consumerism was arising, Simon's Patent Timepiece revolutionized the clock industry, becoming the most popular clock in the United States, whereas Europe lacked some counterpart of it.\n\nWillard patented its creation quite late (1802) but most competitors of Simon dodged this document, reaping much money with their own versions of the Patent Timepiece. However, Simon never filed a demand against such usage. After 1802, in Simon's workshop, the smaller Banjo and shelf clocks were the bread and butter models while Simon pursued his other great projects, throughout the United States. Eventually, Willard's workshop manufactured 4,000 small timepieces (Banjo and shelf clocks).\n\nSince its patenting, the Patent Timepiece remained with the same original design. Typically, they were surrounded by glass tablets, which were reversely painted with neoclassical motifs. Additionally, Willard expanded the Banjo clock in accordance with the patent, making much larger \"seconds beating\" regulators.\n\nBefore creating the Banjo model, Simon designed a shelf clock (1780s, Grafton). It was similar to the tall model, with its original hood and base, but lacking its middle body. The shortened shelf clocks had lower prices, too, and they were commercially successful. Shelf models were produced until approximately 1830.\n\nIn 1818 he invented and patented a type of mantel clock, known as the lighthouse clock and regarded as the first alarm clock produced in America. Originally known as the \"Patent Alarm Timepiece\", they have become known as lighthouse clocks (a 20th-century term) for their obvious similarities. The design of the cases were based on the Classical art then in vogue; Neoclassicism and Empire. Some of these clocks, however, are less formal and reflect the vernacular interest in painted furniture, particularly Windsor chairs.\n\nIt is worth mention, an unusual exemplary displayed in one of the bookshelves of the White House library, made by the clockmaker to commemorate the visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States in 1824-25. A likeness of Lafayette appears in a medallion on its base.\n\nFor the United States Capitol in Washington, the Senate requested Simon Willard to build a large gallery clock. Subsequently, he was invited both to set the clock up and to show its working.\n\nEventually, this trip had particular importance because Simon Willard became acquainted with President Thomas Jefferson. After that they became close friends.\n\nAmong their first correspondence, in 1801 Thomas Jefferson alerted Simon Willard that his banjo timepiece hadn't yet been patented. Subsequently, on November 25, 1801, Willard made his application to the US Patent Office. The patent was both granted and issued on February 8, 1802. It was signed by President Jefferson, Secretary of State James Madison, and Attorney General Levi Lincoln.\n\nIn subsequent years, Simon Willard visited Thomas Jefferson at his home, Monticello, near Charlottesville, Virginia. There they held many conversations. On one occasion, Thomas Jefferson invited Willard to chop a young tree down. Subsequently, Jefferson transformed it into a cane. It was given a silver mount that read: \"Thomas Jefferson to Simon Willard, Monticello.\"\n\nMinister Joseph Eckley and the congregation of Old South Meeting House in Boston, the site of planning for the Boston Tea Party, commissioned Willard to build a carved and gilded gallery clock to hang opposite the pulpit on the balustrade of the room's south gallery. The clock was capped with a spread eagle, carved in high relief and gilded, and measures 32\" in height. The clock was delivered c. 1805, and remained within the meeting house until 1872, when the congregation moved to Old South Church in Boston's Back Bay.\n\nFor 50 years, Willard was responsible for the periodic maintenance of all clocks at Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Additionally, he oversaw Harvard's management of its clocks. Willard presented two clocks to Harvard. One was a tall-case clock; the other was a wall-mounted regulator clock that was installed in a room near University Hall.\n\nA particular incident relates to Harvard's Great Orrery which was malfunctioning. Many craftsmen had unsuccessfully attempted to repair it, until finally Harvard's authorities offered an important reward to Simon if he was able to fix it. For days, Willard analyzed the device. He fixed the orrery by drilling a hole and fastening a rivet. The satisfied authorities asked: \"Now, Mr. Willard. How much do we owe you?\" Willard simply answered: \"Oh. About a ninepence will do, I guess.\"\n\nIn 1826, Thomas Jefferson requested that Simon Willard build a clock for the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. The clock was to be a turret one and would be placed into the university's rotunda. Jefferson provided all of the clock's plans and specifications. According to these plans, Willard precisely assembled all the clock's pieces. The clock was installed in 1827. Jefferson, however, did not live to see the operating clock because he died in July, 1826. In 1895 a blaze destroyed both the university's building and Willard's clock.\n\nAt his home, Montpelier, in Orange, Virginia, former President Madison received Simon Willard. Madison gifted Willard with a second illustrious cane. Its mounting was silvered, and it read \"Presented by James Madison, Ex-President of the United States, to Simon Willard, May 29, 1827.\"\n\nAfter an official request, in 1837 the last two of Simon Willard's important works were again destined for the United States Capitol. Although Willard was already 84 years old, he travelled to personally install both.\n\nOne clock was placed into the Old Senate Chamber but was later installed in the Old Supreme Court Chamber. The other was a bare mechanism, designed to fit into the preexisting case sculpted by Carlo Franzoni in 1819 and titled \"Car of History\"; it depicts Clio, the Greek muse of history in a chariot. It is located above the east entrance to the old chamber of the House of Representatives, now called National Statuary Hall. Both clocks are still operational.\n\nThe gallery, or banjo, clock had been invented years before, in Grafton, but its patent was issued in 1802. The original model had been called the Grafton wall clock. Later, it was also known as the Improved Timepiece. In 1816, its patent expired.\n\nImmediately after arriving to Boston, Willard developed a movable mechanism to turn meat on a spit, the roasting jack, which was specifically designed for outdoor fireplaces. For it, he reduced the traditional English Lantern clock, simplifying its components. Willard's clock jack was patented, on July 2, 1764, and the document was inked by John Hancock.\n\nThe third clock which was patented by Willard was the Patent Alarm Timepiece, which was also known as the Lighthouse and which was similar to the English Skeleton Timepiece.\n\nSimon Willard married Hannah Willard on November 29, 1776. She was a 20 years old Grafton native. Their lone son was born in 1777, on February 6, and he was named Isaac Watts Willard.\n\nIn 1787, Simon Willard married again, to Mary Bird, a 24-year-old Boston native. Of their sons, both Benjamin and Simon continued their father's craft.\n\nSucceeding Willard generations continued successfully as horologists. Beginning in 1828, Simon Willard Jr. (1795–1874) apprenticed in horology at his father's shop; he subsequently established his own workshop in Boston. Also, he specialized in both watches and chronometers, while his foremost jobs were Harvard's astronomical clock and the astronomical regulator which standardized the time for all New England's railroads.\n\nIn 1839, Simon Willard retired. He sold his business to Elnathan Taber, his apprentice. Furthermore, Taber received the business' name too.\n\nOn August 30, 1848, Simon Willard died in Boston. He was 95 years old. Because of his commercial traits, Simon finished his life with just five hundred dollars. However, simultaneously all other competing clock manufacturers had benefitted from producing the Banjo Clock massively, although the corresponding royalties were never claimed by Willard.\n\n\nThe Grafton farm which held the original Willard family's workshop is open to the public and has become a museum, the Willard House and Clock Museum, which exhibits over 90 original clocks and many Willards' heirlooms too.\n\nThe J. Cheney Wells Clock Gallery is located at Old Sturbridge Village, Sturbridge, Massachusetts. The 122-clock collection ranges from 1725 up to 1825. Some pieces are valuated above hundreds of thousands of dollars. The collection features several clocks attributed to Simon Willard.\n\nThe National Watch and Clock Museum in Columbia, Pennsylvania, houses several Simon Willard clocks.\n\nThe Dedham Historical Society in Dedham, Massachusetts, owns a Chippendale brass-mounted mahogany astronomical wall clock by Simon Willard: Engraving date 1780-81; perpetual calendar begins 1780.\n\nOn January 24, 2003, with its American Design Series, the US Postal Service issued a commemorative 10 cent stamp which features a Banjo clock, thus remembering Simon Willard. The stamp featured an image of a Banjo Clock's dial, drawn by the artist Lou Nolan.\n\n\n\n\n"}

On 3 March 2011, the group merged with Veolia Transport, one of its main competitors, into Veolia Transdev. During 2013, Veolia Transdev was renamed Transdev, recognising the planned withdrawal of Veolia Environnement from ownership of the group.\n\nAs part of this merger, the RATP Group, a minority shareholder in Transdev, took direct ownership of a number of former Transdev operations in lieu of a cash payment.\n\nTransdev was also a shareholder of Transamo, a transport engineering and consultancy firm in Europe, which specialises in the project management of public transport projects in France. It was passed onto Veolia Transdev after the merger. Société de Transports intercommunaux de Bruxelles (STIB) is the other major shareholder of Transamo.\n\nAs of the time of the merger with Veolia Transport, the group had 47,000 employees and had an annual revenue of €2.5 billion. It had operations in France (representing 39% of its revenue, 18,200 employees), the Netherlands (33% of its revenue, 14,700 employees), the United Kingdom (11%), Italy (6%), Portugal (5%) and also in Germany, Australia, Canada, Spain and Morocco.

The game's influences draw heavily from the occult, with the Master Therion in the plot below a reference to Aleister Crowley. To finish the game, the player must invoke numerous demons who are based on their \"real\" counterparts, e.g. Belezbar is based on Beelzebub.\n\nFrom the instruction booklet:\n\nAxil the Able stood in three inches of stagnant water and surveyed one of the most dismal dungeons he had ever been thrown into… 30 seconds earlier, he was sitting in front of the ox-roast in that famed haunt of the Occult, The Golden Thurible engaged in his favourite pastime of Wizard-Baiting. What a good story Axil was telling — a new one about Therion, a certain moon creature and a rather gullible Elf — really, the sudden silence of his audience should have warned him. The crowd parted as Therion strode across the floor, dangerous in all his ten degrees. Therion raised a twig-like index finger and flung Axil several hundred leagues across Graumerphy, into the dungeons beneath the dreary castle called Collodon's Pile. In the dark twilight, Axil tutted — and then took stock. He was, at least, clothed: he carried a large leather pouch, and on a nearby table, there was a book. The title read as follows: The Net of Gugamon — a grimoire: wherein is contained the proper rites for the Convocation of various Demonly Princes, the procurement of lesser spirits, together with sundry workings, conjurations, manifestations, symbols relating to all manner of Astral Phenomena and so on for several more pages, in the rather turgid style thought necessary for such books. Unfortunately, apart from the title, there seemed to be little more than a rather tattered contents page. But they didn't call him Axil the Able for nothing. So, with a flourish, he marched for the door in search of a way out.\n\nThe player controls the neophyte wizard Axil the Able and must help him escape from the dungeons below the castle of Colloden's Pile. This a keyboard-only game, and uses a set of commands (called \"Merphish\" in-game) such as the standard north, south, east and west (N,S,E,W) and some additional unique commands such as invoke (I), freeze (f), and blast (b). Conversations with certain friendly characters such as Apex the Ogre are initiated in the following syntax: \"[character],[speech]\" e.g. \"Apex, thanks\".\n\nThe dungeons are full of dangerous and hostile creatures such as wyverns, goblins and vampires. Axil can defend himself using magic to stall or kill these creatures. Not everyone in the dungeon is an enemy, some inhabitants (such as Apex the Ogre) are friendly unless provoked and can be conversed with.\n\nThe dungeon itself is separated into several distinct levels which Axil can travel to and from at will provided he can find the staircases up or down.\n\nThe game could be finished in three different ways, each way being of\nvarying difficulty. The game was planned to be the first part of a trilogy, but the other games were never created.\n\nReviews of the game were highly positive all round, with the only common criticism being the blocky graphics. To reduce the memory impact of the large animated graphics, the programmers blew up single graphic cells to create all the sprites and foreground scenery in the game, effectively reducing the resolution of the graphics but compressing them in memory and so increasing the amount of space available for game content.\n\nThe game won the award for best adventure game of the year in \"CRASH\". It was also runner-up in the Golden Joystick Awards.\n\n"}

This audio drama was presented on three compact discs, and was made by Big Finish as their primary release to celebrate forty years of \"Doctor Who\". As of February 2015, it is being sold as a download.\n\nFollowing directly from the events of \"Neverland\", the casket of anti-time which was destined for Gallifrey had exploded within the confines of the TARDIS. It seems that the Eighth Doctor and Charley have saved Gallifrey, and that the paradox of Charley's existence had been resolved, but the Doctor begins behaving strangely — he has been taken over by Zagreus.\n\nThe Doctor/Zagreus rages through the TARDIS and strikes Charley, but there is a loud explosion, and when they recover the Doctor/Zagreus is alone in the TARDIS. Charley finds herself in Harley Street talking to her mother Lady Louisa Pollard, who mentions amongst other out of place information that one of her sisters is called Romana. Charley is taken to see a Dr Zagreus, and her mother turns into a white rabbit from \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". Charley then meets someone whom she recognises as the Brigadier.\n\nThe Doctor/Zagreus, unsure of his true identity, stumbles into a TARDIS library. He hears a mysterious voice in the TARDIS, that of one of his previous incarnations, the Third Doctor. The Brigadier tells Charley that everything she has seen is a holographic projection created by the TARDIS. She is then shown scenes from her own memory to provide her with insight into what has happened to the Doctor.\n\nThe Doctor leaves the library through a secret passage and finds a part of the TARDIS unaffected by the anti-time infection, from where he is able to converse with Zagreus. Zagreus shows him all possible alternate time lines, including universes where the Doctor plucked out one of his own hearts, and tells the Doctor that he would destroy all of them if he was unleashed.\n\nCharley and the Brigadier find themselves in another holographic projection, this time a 1950s army barracks. Charley realises that the Brigadier is also a hologram, created by the TARDIS. The Brigadier mentions something called \"The Divergence\" and says that the Time Lords would not be able to intervene lest they become infected with the anti-time. In the TARDIS, the Doctor hears the Third Doctor's voice again and finds a book \"The Alice Compendium\" in which he reads Charley's name and the phrases \"the divergence\" and \"Nana Saviltride\".\n\nCharley and the Brigadier realise the projection is of Cardington, where the R101 was launched in 1930. There, a Doctor Stone is conducting an experiment, which causes a huge explosion. The Doctor hears the explosion and rushes to the TARDIS control room, but finds himself instead in a forest. There he encounters a huge talking Cat and a large metal box. The Cat tricks the Doctor into entering the box and seals him in with a cyanide bottle, which is a Schrödinger's cat demonstration. The Doctor realises the meaning — if he left the TARDIS he would become either fully himself or fully Zagreus.\n\nAt Cardington, Stone argues with the base chaplain Matthew Townsend about his research. Townsend expresses reservations about possible military applications of Stone's research, and wonders about the course of human evolution. Charley overhears Stone talking about the military application of \"Dionysus\" — the code name of her project. It had torn a hole in reality, which might be used as a weapon. Miss Foster, who had told Charley and the Brigadier that she was a military secret agent, tries to plant a bomb on the Dionysus project; she was in fact a spy for communist Cuba. Threatening to kill them all, Foster forces Townsend to operate the machine, creating another rift in time. All but Charley and Townsend are sucked into the rift; on the other side of the rift are creatures trying to break through.\n\nOn ancient Gallifrey, the Great Mother, Cassandra, Provost Tepesh and Lady Ouida discuss why their groups despise Rassilon. Rassilon has destroyed followers of the Great Mother's religion, and Tepesh is of the Arcalian chapter whom Rassilon has hunted nearly to extinction. Combined, they plan to attack Rassilon's Foundry, his secret base. Charley and Brigadier are between holographic projections. They discuss what they saw at Cardington, creatures from outside of the boundaries of time and space trying to break through. Charley wonders aloud whether she could take the Doctor's place by absorbing Zagreus into her, allowing the Doctor to go free.\n\nThe Doctor is beginning to unravel the mystery. The Cat is another avatar of the TARDIS. The Doctor's being in the forest was to protect him from events elsewhere. He realises \"Saviltride\" is an anagram of \"evil TARDIS\", from which he deduces that not only was his only personality split in two, so was that of the TARDIS. Tepesh and the Great Mother enter Rassilon's Foundry where they meet Charley, however they perceive her as being Rassilon. Cassandra says something which offends Tepesh, and he orders Ouida to kill her and drink her blood. She cannot regenerate as Rassilon was still in the early stages of the genetic experimentation into the Time Lord gift. When an automated system reveals some of Rassilon's secrets, Charley discovers that Rassilon, fearing for the survival of the Time Lords, created self-replicating biogenic molecules and sent them back in time. The effect of these molecules was to ensure that all life-forms in the universe evolved to something approximating the Gallifreyan norm. To prevent creatures from the Divergence entering our universe, he then sealed time into a loop.\n\nThe Dionysus Project that Charley saw at Cardington had breached the loop, allowing creatures from the Divergent universe to enter ours. Tepesh reveals that the Vampires had only drunk the blood of specially bred animals, but Rassilon's purges forced them to drink the blood of intelligent species in order to survive. He refrains from attacking Charley/Rassilon until he has discovered all the Foundry's secrets. The automated recorder reveals the Foundry draws its power from the Divergent universe. When the Brigadier advises Charley to switch off the power, this allows creatures from the Divergence to break through. The Great Mother reveals that Rassilon stole the secret of regeneration from the Vampires, and that much of Time Lord technology was stolen from the Divergent universe. The Foundry's defences seal off the whole base and prepare to fire storm it to prevent the escape of the Divergent creatures. The Brigadier and Charley escape through a mirror, but Tepesh, Ouida and the Great Mother are killed.\n\nCharley finds herself within another scenario, and this time her appearance is that of a mouse in battle armour. She is in some sort of bizarre theme park where animatronic animals are battling with animatronic humans. The Doctor meanwhile is fighting against the TARDIS, destroying parts of its architecture. The Brigadier arrives, and is revealed to be an avatar of the TARDIS's Zagreus personality. To defend the TARDIS, the Brigadier summons a Jabberwock, and the Doctor flees. Charley encounters Goldilocks, the leader of the enemy humans. They are fighting to get control of the Animator, but both sides wish to release from suspended animation so they do so. The Animator, Uncle Winky, was suspended in the year 2367. To his horror, he discovers he has been in suspended animation for 60 billion years and has awoken on the dead world of Gallifrey, which the theme park was moved to. They are on what was once the Foundry, and the animatronic creatures have fallen under the influence of the Divergence creatures. They revived Winky to operate the controls of the Foundry machines, but he dies of the heart condition which he had entered suspended animation to survive.\n\nHaving escaped the Jabberwock, the Doctor now plucks Charley out of the simulation. Charley is unable to trust the Doctor as he had hit her earlier, and she no longer trusts the Brigadier avatar. Rassilon himself appears and reveals that after the explosion, the Doctor and Charley had been unconscious for six months, in which time Rassilon had persuaded the TARDIS to aid him in exchange for freeing it from the Doctor/Zagreus's influence. On Gallifrey, Cardinal Braxiatel informs Romana that the Doctor's TARDIS has dematerialised of its own accord. Leela then arrives with a message from Rassilon concerning the fate of the Doctor.\n\nCharley finds herself in a bleak landscape, together with Townsend, Tepesh and Winky. Ahead of them they see a Dark Tower — they are in the Death Zone on Gallifrey.\n\nRomana, Leela and K-9 transmat to Rassilon's tomb within the dark tower. Rassilon's spirit speaks through Leela, and leads them to a Matrix simulation of the Dark Tower in ancient times. Meanwhile, Charley informs Townsend, Tepesh and Winky that they are Zagreus's recreations of the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, and also the only people to have ever seen the Divergence. Charley tried to persuade them to go to the Dark Tower, but Tepesh is reluctant to play the Game of Rassilon. The Jabberwock then appears, but they subdue it by reciting nonsense poetry, using it to fly them into the Dark Tower.\n\nRassilon demands that Romana resign from the presidency in favour of Zagreus. When she refuses, Rassilon uses the possessed Leela to attack Romana and K-9, whose head gets knocked off. The Jabberwock crashes into the Dark Tower, but Charley and the recreated Doctors make their way inside. Their passage is blocked by a booby-trapped chessboard and hear a riddle from Rassilon. The Doctors think the answer is related to the number \"pi\", but upon crossing Winkle is nearly hit by a bowspike. Instead Charley deduces that they must move across using the knight's move in chess. They find Leela attacking Romana, and Charley knocks her unconscious.\n\nRassilon and the Brigadier avatar have chained up the Doctor and are preparing to torture him. When the Doctor asks about Charley, the avatar flies into a rage, ranting about how the TARDIS had suffered in its many adventures with the Doctor, especially its recent absorption of anti-time to save Charley. The Doctor realises the TARDIS is jealous of Charley. Rassilon summons the Doctor and the Brigadier into the Foundry, which he proudly declares to be the place where he created the Nemesis and the De-mat gun. Rassilon shows them a frozen solar system — one which housed a species which could have threatened the Time Lords. The Brigadier avatar destroys the police box shell of the TARDIS in the Foundry's smelting works.\n\nFrom the Dark Tower, Romana, Charley, the Doctors and a K-9 find a secret entrance to the Foundry through the mirror. Townsend cracks a code in Old High Gallifreyan, proving they were created from the Doctor's memories and thus retain some elements of his knowledge. Pushing past the Brigadier, they find the Doctor by an anvil creating a sword from the molten TARDIS shell. Rassilon believes that he has destroyed the Doctor's sanity thus allowing Zagreus full control. The Doctor's other aspects tell him Rassilon is manipulating him as a weapon against the creatures of the Divergent universe, as the creatures of the Divergent Universe would have evolved to surpass the Time Lords before Rassilon locked them away. Rassilon seizes the anti-time sword and slays all the Doctors but the Eighth. Charley, Romana and Leela try to avoid being shot by the Brigadier and Romana transports him into the crucible.\n\nThe Doctor gives the anti-time sword to Charley, and begs her to kill him before Zagreus takes over. Charley cannot kill him for she loves him, but when the Doctor tells her that he does not love her, she pierces him with the sword before breaking down in tears. The Doctor does not regenerate, however; when Rassilon killed Townsend, Tepesh and Winkle those parts of him were removed, and when Charley stabbed him they were restored saving him from death. It is Zagreus who awakens, but when Rassilon commands him to enter the Divergent universe to slay the creatures, Zagreus instead throws Rassilon into the Divergence to face his fate, refusing to be Rassilon's puppet. Zagreus prepares to attack the Doctor's companions, but the Brigadier arrives and overpowers him. In the crucible, the TARDIS had been restored. Now free from the anti-time infection, the Brigadier avatar gives Zagreus a \"drink me\" potion which purges the Zagreus influence from the Doctor.\n\nThe Doctor tells Charley that she must leave him — the zero matter in the \"drink me\" potion has stabilised him, but he is still infected by anti-time. He intends to travel to the Divergent universe to quarantine himself forever and protect the universe from the anti-time infection. Charley storms out of the TARDIS, whereupon Romana speaks to the Doctor telling him that he will never be allowed to return and the Time Lords will prevent him from doing so if he tries. Romana leaves the TARDIS and it dematerialises. Romana asks Leela where Charley is, and Leela asks Romana if she was aware that the TARDIS had a back door. Leela asks if Romana still finds her stupid and Romana says this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\n\nThe Doctor prepares for his new life in the Divergent universe, excited by the prospect of seeing new worlds and new people. He is not yet aware that Charley will be seeing them with him ...\n\n\n\n\n"}

As there are often several generations of copies between an extant copy of an ancient text and the original, each handwritten by different scribes, there is a natural tendency for extraneous material to be inserted into such documents over time.\n\nInterpolations originally may be inserted as an authentic explanatory note (for example, ), but may also be included for fraudulent purposes. The forged passages and works attributed to the Pseudo-Isidore are an example of the latter. Similarly, the letters of Ignatius of Antioch were interpolated by Apollinarian heretics, three centuries after the originals were written. Charters and legal texts are also subject to forgery of this kind. In the 13th century a medieval romance, the \"Prose Tristan\", inserted another prose romance, the Vulgate \"Queste del Saint Graal\", in its entirety in order to reinterpret the Quest for the Holy Grail through the optics of the Tristan story. \n\nHowever, most interpolations result from the errors and inaccuracies which tend to arise during hand-copying, especially over long periods of time. For example, if a scribe made an error when copying a text and omitted some lines, he would have tended to include the omitted material in the margin. However, margin notes made by readers are present in almost all manuscripts. Therefore, a different scribe seeking to produce a copy of the manuscript perhaps many years later could find it very difficult to determine whether a margin note was an omission made by the previous scribe (which should be included in the text) or simply a note made by a reader (which should be ignored or kept in the margin).\n\nConscientious scribes tended to copy everything which appeared in a manuscript, but in all cases scribes needed to exercise personal judgement. Explanatory notes would tend to find their way into the body of a text as a natural result of this subjective process.\n\nModern scholars have developed techniques for recognizing interpolation, which are often apparent to modern observers, but would have been less so for medieval copyists.\n\nThe Comma Johanneum, for example, is commonly regarded as interpolation. The specific problem of Christian transmission of Jewish texts outside the Jewish and Christian canons is often described as Christian interpolation.\n\n"}

{"id": "2193450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193450", "title": "Richmond Bridge, London", "text": "Richmond Bridge, London\n\nRichmond Bridge is an 18th-century stone arch bridge that crosses the River Thames at Richmond, connecting the two halves of the present-day London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It was designed by James Paine and Kenton Couse.\n\nThe bridge, which is a Grade I listed, was built between 1774 and 1777, as a replacement for a ferry crossing which connected Richmond town centre on the east bank with its neighbouring district of East Twickenham to the west. Its construction was privately funded by a tontine scheme, for which tolls were charged until 1859. Because the river meanders from its general west to east direction, flowing from southeast to northwest in this part of London, what would otherwise be known as the north and south banks are often referred to as the \"Middlesex\" (Twickenham) and \"Surrey\" (Richmond) banks respectively, named after the historic counties to which each side once belonged.\n\nThe bridge was widened and slightly flattened in 1937–40, but otherwise still conforms to its original design. The eighth Thames bridge to be built in what is now Greater London, it is today the oldest surviving Thames bridge in London.\n\nThe small town of Sheen on the Surrey bank of the Thames, west of the City of London or by river, had been the site of a royal palace since 1299. After it was destroyed by fire in 1497, Henry VII built a new palace on the site, naming it Richmond Palace after his historic title of Earl of Richmond, and the central part of Sheen became known as Richmond.\n\nAlthough a ferry had almost certainly existed at the site of the present-day bridge since Norman times, the earliest known crossing of the river at Richmond dates from 1439. The service was owned by the Crown, and operated by two boats, a small skiff for the transport of passengers and a larger boat for horses and small carts; the Twickenham Ferry, slightly upstream, was also in service from at least 1652. However, due to the steepness of the hill leading to the shore-line on the Surrey side neither ferry service was able to transport carriages or heavily laden carts, forcing them to make a very lengthy detour via Kingston Bridge.\n\nIn the 18th century Richmond and neighbouring Twickenham on the opposite bank of the Thames, both of which were distant from London but enjoyed efficient transport links to the city via the river, became extremely fashionable, and their populations began to grow rapidly. As the ferry was unable to handle large loads and was often cancelled due to weather conditions, the river crossing became a major traffic bottleneck.\n\nLocal resident William Windham had been sub-tutor to Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, and was the former husband of Mary, Lady Deloraine, mistress to George II. As a reward for his services, George II leased Windham the right to operate the ferry until 1798. Windham sub-let the right to operate the ferry to local resident Henry Holland. With the ferry unable to serve the demands of the area, in 1772 Windham sought Parliamentary approval to replace the ferry with a wooden bridge, to be paid for by tolls.\n\nThe plans for a wooden bridge proved unpopular, and in 1772 the Richmond Bridge Act was passed by Parliament, selecting 90 commissioners, including landscape architect Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown, historian and politician Horace Walpole and playwright and actor David Garrick, to oversee the construction of a stone bridge on the site of the ferry. The Act stipulated that no tax of any sort could be used to finance the bridge, and fixed a scale of tolls, ranging from ½d for a pedestrian to 2s 6d for a coach drawn by six horses (about 50p and £ respectively in 2020). Henry Holland was granted £5,350 (about £ in 2020) compensation for the loss of the ferry service. The commission appointed James Paine and Kenton Couse to design and build the new bridge.\nThe Act specified that the bridge was to be built on the site of the existing ferry \"or as much lower down the river as the Commission can settle\". Local residents lobbied for it to be built at Water Lane, a short distance downstream from the ferry site. The approach to the river was relatively flat, avoiding the steep slope to the existing ferry pier on the Surrey bank. However, the Dowager Duchess of Newcastle refused to allow the approach road on the Middlesex bank to pass through her land at Twickenham Park, and the commission was forced to build on the site of the ferry, despite a steep 1 in 16 (6.25%) incline.\n\nThe bridge was designed as a stone arch bridge of in length and in width, supported by five elliptical arches of varying heights. The tall wide central span was designed to allow shipping to pass, giving Richmond Bridge a distinctive humpbacked appearance. It was built in Portland stone, and ran between Ferry Hill (Bridge Street today) on the Surrey side and Richmond Road on the Middlesex side; sharp curves in the approach roads on the Middlesex side (still in existence today) were needed to avoid the Dowager Duchess of Newcastle's land at Twickenham Park. Palladian toll houses were built in alcoves at each end.\n\nThe building was put out to tender, and on 16 May 1774 Thomas Kerr was awarded the contract to build the bridge for the sum of £10,900 (about £ in 2020). With additional costs, such as compensating landowners and building new approach roads, total costs came to approximately £26,000 (about £ in 2020).\n\nMost of the money needed was raised from the sale of shares at £100 each (approximately £ in 2020) in two tontine schemes, the first for £20,000 and the second for £5,000. The first was appropriately called the Richmond-Bridge Tontine, but when it became clear that the initial £20,000 would not be sufficient to complete construction a second tontine was set up. Each investor was guaranteed a return of 4% per annum, so £1,000 per annum from the income raised from tolls was divided amongst the investors in the two tontines. On the death of a shareholder their share of the dividend was divided among the surviving shareholders. To avoid fraud, each investor was obliged to sign an affidavit that they were alive before receiving their dividend. Any revenue over the £1,000 per annum required to pay the investors was held in a general fund for the maintenance of the bridge.\n\nConstruction began on 23 August 1774. The Prince of Wales was invited to lay the first stone but declined, and so the stone was laid by commission member Henry Hobart. The bridge opened to pedestrians in September 1776 and to other traffic on 12 January 1777, at which time the ferry service was closed, although work on the bridge was not completed until December 1777. A large milestone was placed at the Richmond end, giving the distances to other bridges and to local towns.\n\nThere was no formal opening ceremony, and little initial recorded public reaction. However, the bridge soon became much admired for its design; an article in \"The London Magazine\" in 1779 said that the bridge was \"a simple, yet elegant structure, and, from its happy situation, is ... one of the most beautiful ornaments of the river ... from whatever point of view the bridge is beheld, it presents the spectator with one of the richest landscapes nature and art ever produced by their joint efforts, and connoisseurs in painting will instantly be reminded of some of the best performances of Claude Lorraine\". James Paine proudly illustrated it among the designs in the second volume of his \"Plans, Elevations, and Sections of Noblemen and Gentlemen's Houses\", 1783. Richmond Bridge was the subject of paintings by many leading artists, including Thomas Rowlandson, John Constable and local resident J. M. W. Turner.\nSevere penalties were imposed for vandalising the bridge. The Richmond Bridge Act 1772 specified that the punishment for \"willful or malicious damage\" to the bridge should be \"transportation to one of His Majesty's Colonies in America for the space of seven years\". A warning against damage can still be seen on the milestone at the Surrey end of the bridge.\n\nRichmond Bridge was a commercial success, generating £1,300 per annum in tolls (about £ in 2020) in 1810. By 1822, the company had accumulated a sufficient surplus that all vehicle tolls were reduced to one penny.\nOn 10 March 1859 the last subscriber to the main tontine died, having for over five years received the full £800 per annum set aside for subscribers to the first tontine, and with the death of its last member the scheme expired. On 25 March 1859 Richmond Bridge became toll-free. A large procession made its way to the bridge, where a team of labourers symbolically removed toll gates from their hinges. The toll houses were demolished, replaced by seating in 1868; investment income from the revenue accumulated during the 83 years the tolls had been charged was sufficient to pay for the bridge's maintenance.\n\nIn 1846 the first railway line reached Richmond. Richmond gasworks opened in 1848, and Richmond began to develop into a significant town. The District Railway (later the District line) reached Richmond in 1877, connecting it to the London Underground. Commuting to central London became feasible and affordable, leading to further population growth in the previously relatively isolated Richmond and Twickenham areas.\n\nBy the early 20th century the bridge was proving inadequate for the increasing traffic, particularly with the introduction of motorised transport, and a speed limit was enforced. With the remaining investment income from tolls insufficient to pay for major reconstruction, on 31 March 1931 the bridge was taken into the joint public ownership of Surrey and Middlesex councils, and proposals were made to widen it. The plans were strongly opposed on aesthetic grounds, and the decision was taken to build instead a new bridge a short distance downstream to relieve traffic pressure.\nThe new Twickenham Bridge opened in 1933, but Richmond Bridge was still unable to handle the volume of traffic, so in 1933 Sir Harley Dalrymple-Hay proposed possible methods for widening the bridge without significantly affecting its appearance. The cheapest of Dalrymple-Hay's proposals, to transfer the footpaths onto stone corbels projecting from the sides of the bridge thus freeing the entire width for vehicle traffic, was rejected on aesthetic grounds, and a proposal to widen the bridge on both sides was rejected as impractical. A proposal to widen the bridge on the upstream side was settled on as causing the least disruption to nearby buildings, and in 1934 it was decided to widen the bridge by , at a cost of £73,000 (about £ in 2020).\n\nThe Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company of Darlington was appointed to carry out the rebuilding. In 1937 each stone on the upstream side was removed and numbered and the bridge widened; the stone facing of the upstream side was then reassembled and the bridge reopened to traffic in 1940. Throughout the redevelopment, a single lane of traffic was kept open at all times. It was found that the 18th-century foundations, consisting of wooden platforms sunk into the river bed, had largely rotted away, and they were reinforced with steel pilings and concrete foundations. During the widening works the opportunity was also taken to lower slightly the roadbed at the centre of the bridge and raise the access ramps, reducing the humpbacked nature of the bridge's central section.\n\nJames Paine went on to design three other Thames bridges after Richmond, at Chertsey (1783), Kew (1783), and Walton (1788). Paine and Couse renewed their working relationship on the design of Chertsey Bridge, the only one of the three still in existence. Paine became High Sheriff of Surrey in 1783.\n\nIn 1962, Richmond Council announced the replacement of the gaslamps on the bridge with electric lighting. The Richmond Society, a local pressure group, protested at the change to the character of the bridge, and succeeded in forcing the council to retain the Victorian gas lamp-posts, converted to electric light, which remain in place today.\n\nIn the history of Richmond Bridge there have only been two reported serious collisions between boats and the bridge. On 20 March 1964, three boats tied together at Eel Pie Island, upstream, broke from their moorings in a storm and were swept downstream, colliding with the bridge. Although no serious damage was caused to the bridge, the \"Princess Beatrice\", an 1896 steamer once used by Gilbert and Sullivan, was damaged beyond repair. On 30 January 1987, the \"Brave Goose\", the £3,500,000 yacht of National Car Parks founder Sir Donald Gosling, became wedged under the central arch of the bridge, eventually being freed at low tide the next day.\nThe eighth Thames bridge to be built in what is now Greater London, Richmond Bridge is currently the oldest surviving bridge over the Thames in Greater London, and the oldest Thames bridge between the sea and Abingdon Bridge in Oxfordshire. Richmond Bridge was Grade I listed in 1952 and it is the only Georgian bridge over the Thames in London. Its bicentenary was celebrated on 7 May 1977; the commemoration was held four months after the actual anniversary of 12 January, to avoid poor weather conditions.\n\nThe tradition of boat hire, repairs and boatbuilding continues at the bridge and tunnels at Richmond Bridge Boathouses under boatbuilder Mark Edwards, awarded his MBE in 2013 for \"services to boatbuilding\" including construction of the royal barge Gloriana.\n\nJust to the south of the bridge, in a park at the Richmond end, is a bust of the first president of Chile, Bernardo O'Higgins, who studied in Richmond from 1795 until 1798. In 1998, 200 years after he left Richmond, the bust, whose sculptor is unknown, was unveiled. The patch of ground which the statue overlooks is called \"O'Higgins Square\". The Mayor of Richmond lays a wreath at the bust every year in the presence of staff from the Chilean Embassy in London.\n\n"}

The concept was developed by ancient Greek thinkers around 400 BC and developed further by Galen. People were thought to be either of the four temperaments: choleric, melancholic, phlegmatic, or sanguine.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages in Europe, the Latin term \"complexio\" served as the translated form of the Greek word \"crasis\", meaning temperament. The term “temperament” referred to the balance of the qualities of hot, wet, cold, and dry; each human body carried a different mixture of the elements. Thus, the Scythians, who lived in a cold climate, were considered colder and moister in complexion; the Aethiopians were hotter and drier. Complexion was defined as “that quality which results from the mutual interaction and interpassion of the four contrary primary qualities residing within the elements. These elements are so minutely intermingled as each to lie in very intimate relationship to one another. Their opposite powers alternately conquer and become conquered until a quality is reached which is uniform throughout the whole: this is the complexion.”\n\nAs Matthew Simon writes, “Since it served as a fundamental concept, not only in physiology but also in pathology and therapy, complexion theory provided important support for the idea that medicine constituted a unified and rational body of knowledge.” By observation and judgment, medieval physicians determined the proper complexion of the individual when healthy. The body was healthy when all was in balance, but diagnosis was difficult, as there was no absolute measure of the right complexion, since this varied for individuals. Balance was thought to be restored by various remedies, which included bloodletting, scarifying, purging, and eating certain foods.\n\nComplexion was thought to be an indicator of one's character. The Spanish work known as \"Corbacho\", written by Alfonso Martínez de Toledo (c. 1398—c. 1470), includes a chapter called \"De las complexiones.\" In it he describes the personalities of men of varying complexions: \"There are others who are melancholic: these men correspond to the Earth, which is the fourth element, which is cold and dry. These men are very angry, without a sense of tact or moderation... They have no sense of temperance in anything they do, and only bang their head against the wall. They're very iniquitous, petulant, miserable...”\n\nComplexion, in its original sense, engaged the attention of philosophers and musical theorists from ancient times right through to the Renaissance and beyond, in relation to the most favourable balancing of the 'qualities' or elements in order to heal and invigorate the soul: from Pythagoras and the musical theorist Aristoxenus, through Plato's dialogue \"Phaedo\", Aristotle, Saint Augustine in his thesis on music, and Aquinas; and in the Florentine Renaissance, Marsilio Ficino in his work on the immortality of the soul, the \"Theologia Platonica\".\n\nThus there are many references which filter through into Shakespeare's plays and sonnets derived from this body of thought; particularly in the description of important characters, and to the power of music above all to 'charm the savage breast', adjust the elements, and restore the equilibrium and balance, the 'harmony' of the soul: his characters call for music and are spellbound or restored by it, and in elevated mood, may hear it in the air, or sense its immortal harmonies everywhere.\n\nMany surnames arose out of the existence of a complexion whose particularities may have differed from that of the village or town's population, and thus attracted enough notice to warrant a nickname. The Irish surname \"Rogan\" (from \"Ruadhán\") referred to a person with red hair, or a ruddy complexion. The Scottish surname \"Bain\" (from \"bàn\") referred to a fair-haired person, while \"Dunn\" (from \"donn\") implies brown/dark hair, and \"Duff\" (from \"dubh\") implies black hair. The English surname \"Brown\", an extremely common surname in the English-speaking world, was originally applied to anyone with a slightly darker complexion, in the same manner that the surname White was applied to anyone with a particularly light complexion. The surname \"Gough\" is derived from the Welsh \"goch\" or \"coch\", meaning \"red\" or \"ruddy.\" King William II of England was called William Rufus (\"the Red\") because of his ruddy complexion. Ludovico il Moro (\"the Moor\") was called as such because of his swarthy complexion.\n\nA person's complexion is a biological trait. The protein molecule known as melanin causes variation in tone. Melanocytes insert granules of melanin called \"melanosomes\" into the other skin cells of the human epidermis. The melanosomes in each recipient cell accumulate atop the cellular nucleus, where they protect the nuclear DNA from mutations caused by the sun's ionizing radiation. The human body tends to protect itself against harmful surroundings. The epidermis of the body, very sensitive and delicate, reacts almost immediately to most outside effects. People whose ancestors lived for long periods in the regions of the globe near the Equator generally have more active melanocytes, and therefore larger quantities of melanin in their skins. This makes their skins very dark and protects them against high levels of exposure to the sun (it also depends on the country). In areas of the globe closer to the poles, people have far less need for protection from ionizing radiation, so their skin is usually lighter.\n\nA study published in the Journal of Human Evolution proposes that people in the Tropics have developed dark skin to block out the sun and protect their body's folate reserves. Those living away from the equator have developed a fair skin to absorb enough sunlight to maintain adequate vitamin D in their bodies.\n\n"}

The River Medway is the southern boundary of the parish.\n\nBarming is mentioned in the Domesday Book, and was then described as being divided into East and West; the latter being known as Little Barming, and having its own church until the 16th century.\n\nBarming Primary School dates back to 1854 but is not now located on the original site.\n\nBarming railway station, on the London /Maidstone/ Ashford route, was opened with the line on 1 June 1874 but is not actually located in the parish. It lies 1 mile to the north and is in the neighbouring borough of Tonbridge and Malling.\n\nThe railway station named East Farleigh lies in Barming parish, at the extreme southern boundary adjacent to the River Medway. This is on the scenic Medway Valley Line linking Strood, Maidstone and Paddock Wood.\n\nThe A26 road crosses the parish. Local bus services are provided by Arriva Southern Counties and Nu-Venture.\n\nSurrounded by peace and tranquility the church was built in the Norman period (12th Century) and has a characteristic triangle of east windows and a tower in the perpendicular style has been added. The Church is Grade II* listed and some of the gravestones are Grade I. Amongst many items that you can see are three bench ends made in Germany in 1300. Inside the churchyard is a mounting block - four stone steps built in the 19th century to help riders to mount their horses.\n\nAt 7.15 p.m. on 1 May each year, local morris dancers Kettle Bridge Clogs dance across Barming Bridge (otherwise known as the Kettle Bridge) which spans the River Medway at the southern end of South Street. This event marks the official start of their morris dancing season.\n\nIn and around Barming (as well as much of the UK), it is believed that the word \"barming\" or \"barmy\" (meaning mad or crazy) were named after the village of Barming due to the location of the County of Kent's psychiatric hospital being in barming. whilst this story is generally understood to be apocryphal, many still consider it true.\n\n\n\n"}

A long time in the making, the set was produced by Radiohead and Beck collaborator Nigel Godrich at George Martin's suggestion.\n\nMcCartney plays almost all of the instruments, similar to his 1970 album \"McCartney\" and the 1980 \"McCartney II\" album. In addition, \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" marks the first time since 1984's \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\" that McCartney was not involved in producing one of his studio albums.\n\n\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" was McCartney's last rock album release for longtime label EMI. He signed a deal with Hear Music, owned by Starbucks, in March 2007. He later returned to his old label Capitol Records in 2016.\n\nMcCartney said that the song \"Friends to Go\" is influenced by, and dedicated to, George Harrison.\n\nUpon being asked to produce an album with McCartney, Godrich admitted:\n\nThe two tentatively began a collaboration, recording the songs \"This Never Happened Before\" and \"Follow Me\" which was enough to convince both of them that they could develop an album. Godrich's participation was active: he inspired McCartney to write the song \"At the Mercy\", added piano loops on \"How Kind of You\" and worked with McCartney to slow the tempo of \"Riding to Vanity Fair\" which McCartney says \"changed the mood completely\". Although initially taken aback, McCartney appreciated Godrich's tenacity and honesty.\n\nAccording to McCartney, Godrich was at times blunt in his appraisal of McCartney's songs-in-progress during the making of \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\":\n\nRecording sessions for the album were done over a long period of time, with many pauses. First sessions were held at RAK Studios, London in September 2003 by McCartney and his band. After a few takes, Godrich said to McCartney he wanted to work with him alone, not involving the band. After some months' break, sessions resumed at Ocean Way Studios, Los Angeles in April 2004, with more sessions in September. Final recordings took place at AIR Studios, London in April 2005.\n\nThe cover for \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" is from a photograph of McCartney strumming a guitar in his family's back yard in Liverpool, taken by brother Mike McCartney (aka Mike McGear) and originally entitled \"Paul Under Washing\", before being retitled \"Our Kid Through Mum's Net Curtains\".\n\nThe first single, the upbeat \"Fine Line\", was released in late August 2005, ahead of the release of \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\", and reached No. 20 in the UK. A second single, \"Jenny Wren\", reached No. 22 in the UK that November.\n\nThe 'US' Tour in 2005 helped to promote the album in the US and Canada.\n\nThere was also a promotional concert for the album held at Abbey Road Studios, called \"Chaos and Creation at Abbey Road\".\n\nAt Metacritic, the album holds an average Metascore of 78 out of 100, based on 19 reviews, which indicates a generally favourable reception. Advance reviews for \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" suggested that after delivering \"Flaming Pie\", \"Run Devil Run\", \"Driving Rain\" and this album – all in uninterrupted succession – McCartney was in a late-career creative peak. Many critics and longtime listeners also considered that the album was unusually reflective and intimate-sounding for McCartney. The sudden shift in direction was generally considered an unexpected and welcome surprise, and resulted in four Grammy nominations for the album, including the nomination for Album of the Year.\n\nReviewing for the BBC, Daryl Easlea described \"Chaos and Creation\" as \"Very, very good\", and added: \"'Riding To Vanity Fair', 'Too Much Rain', 'Anyway' and 'How Kind Of You' are full of subtle nuances, killer hooks and sweet surprises. They really do rank among his very best work.\" In \"The New York Times\", Jon Pareles wrote that McCartney's return to a multi-instrumentalist role \"makes the songs more intimate and less conventional\", while remarking of the project: \"Sir Paul chose a producer who favored the experimental side: Nigel Godrich … Sir Paul also lined up his best backup band since the Beatles: himself.\"\n\nIn the US, \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" debuted at the No. 6 on the \"Billboard\" 200 with sales of 91,545 copies. It stayed on chart for a total of 21 weeks, selling over 530,000 copies up to 2007. However, the album underperformed in the UK, peaking at the No. 10 and spending only three weeks inside the top 200, with cumulative sales of around 45,000 units. It fared better in France, selling in excess of 100,000 copies during a 21-week chart run. According to the annual report published by EMI, \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" had sold 1.3 million copies worldwide by the end of March 2006.\n\nAll songs written by Paul McCartney.\n\n\nIn addition to the above tracks, the Japanese release of the CD included the song \"She Is So Beautiful\". The song was also offered as a free download in Windows Media Audio format to US customers who purchased the CD at Target stores. Other bonus downloadable songs were made available to people who bought the CD at certain other stores, such as Best Buy and Wal-Mart. Also, \"Fine Line\" and \"Jenny Wren\" appeared on singles with their running time shortened.\n\nThere are six songs which were recorded during the sessions for \"Chaos\", not included on the album but released as B-sides and on imports:\n\nPersonnel per booklet.\n\n\nPersonnel per booklet.

It began as a converted World War II mortar emplacement, \"Battery Whistler\", and was focused on scientific exploration of the Arctic Basin, and particularly providing the capability to operate attack submarines in the Arctic under the ice canopy.\n\nIn 1941, Dr. Waldo K. Lyon started work at the Navy Radio and Sound Lab, as their first Ph.D. physicist. He was charged with forming and directing initial efforts of the Sound Division. The lab was used during World War II for testing, repairing and modifying submarine equipment and harbor defense systems in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nLyon recalls the creation of the Arctic Submarine Laboratory after the war:\n\nHis recommendation initiated an effort that would last over four decades.\n\nIn 1947, with the merger of Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory and the University of California Division of War Research into the Navy Electronics Laboratory (NEL), Dr. Lyon became head of the Submarine Studies Branch in the Research Division.\n\nA test pool was constructed at Battery Whistler (a converted mortar battery at NEL) to test equipment for deep submergence vehicles like Bathyscaphe \"Trieste\". The pool was equipped to grow sea ice and study its physical properties. The new facility also included a field station at Cape Prince of Wales, Alaska, established in 1951.\nThe Arctic Submarine Lab also included a sea ice cryostat for testing scale-model submarine sails punching up through the ice; and possessed the only betatron on the West Coast for examination into the structures of heavy objects and metals up to in diameter.\n\nEquipment and techniques were designed and tested to enable submarine operation in the Arctic Ocean. Brine content and ice elasticity were measured to apply in the design of submarines that could surface through the ice cover. Cold rooms and calibration facilities at the Arctic Submarine Laboratory were used to solve the problem of icing on submarine snorkel head valves.\n\nDr. Lyon and researcher Art Roshon developed an under-ice sonar that allowed completion of the first winter cruise by s by inverting a fathometer and putting it on top of the submarine.\n\nThe research culminated in the transpolar submerged voyage of in 1958 and included scores of under-ice cruises to gain scientific knowledge essential to Arctic submarine operations.\n\nThrough the 1970s and 1980s the ongoing research at the Arctic Submarine Laboratory resulted in refurbishment and improvement of the Lab's cryogenic facilities. These facilities were used for evaluating icing issues on s, sonar technology developments for remote acoustic measurement of ice thickness, and the ice breakthrough tests for s.\n\nThe Lab continues today with its primary missions, developing new technology for the use of US submarines heading under the polar ice pack and providing operations staff to assist in taking submarines under the ice pack.\n\n\n"}

She is known as LV (short for Little Voice) for her reticence. She flees reality, hiding away in her bedroom, listening to records and mimicking their artists' voices like Gracie Fields', Judy Garland's, and Shirley Bassey's; her love of songs is her only source of strength since her beloved father's death. Her mother, a promiscuous woman with countless affairs, jilts a man when her passion wanes.\n\nBilly, a telephone engineer who mends their phone, approaches LV by giving her information pamphlets. Things improve when Mari is seeing Ray; he hears the girl sing, spots her gift and vows to make her a star, while Mari, who dislikes singing, still doubts her child. Ray arranges with Mr Boo for LV to sing at his club. But her performance is understandably somewhat of a failure as she is overcome by stage fright and only manages a few lines of song. Ray sees that LV needs encouragement on stage and organises a big band, lights and a new dress to give her confidence.\n\nRay gives her a pep talk, persuading her to perform by portraying her act as a tribute to her father. LV, therefore, agrees to sing again, but only as a one-off. When LV is to sing at a nightclub, she envisions her father to help perform well. LV brings the house down and is a storming success. Ray thinks she is his ticket to the big time and arranges for a London agent to come up and see LV perform the following night. As Ray, Mari and Mr Boo toast their future success, LV murmurs that she agreed to sing only the one time and slumps to the floor.\n\nThe following night LV passively remains in her bed and Ray's futile attempts to goad LV are dashed. Mari, who still scorns her child, prods her against her will. The selfish natures of Ray and Mari are very much revealed in these scenes. At the cabaret club the London agent finally loses patience after several third-rate acts fill the time in LV's absence and leaves. Ray storms into the club and sings \"It's Over\" on stage, as his career disappears before everyone's eyes.\n\nMeanwhile, the faulty wiring at LV's home finally starts a fire, trapping LV in her upper room where she is rescued by Billy. In a final showdown with her mother, after being wrongly accused by her mother of arson, LV responds by screaming in her mother's face, blaming her for LV's father's death and blaming her own meek nature on Mari's domineering attitude. She walks away saying her name isn't Little Voice, it's Laura.\n\nMari is left by everyone, Ray is facing his debt collectors, and LV is saved by her discovery of self-confidence.\n\n\nThe following songs are performed by Horrocks:\n\nThe film also features Michael Caine singing \"It's Over\", as performed by Roy Orbison.\n\nRotten Tomatoes gives the film a 79% rating based on 48 reviews with the consensus: \"\"Little Voice\" brings its award-winning source material to the screen in style, elevated by a commanding lead performance from Jane Horrocks.\"\n\nJanet Maslin wrote in her \"New York Times\" review, \"Horrocks's phenomenal mimicry of musical grande dames from Marlene Dietrich to Marilyn Monroe, lavishing special loving care on Judy Garland, makes a splendid centerpiece for the otherwise more ordinary film built around it.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" felt the story was \"amusing but uneven\" and that the film \"seems to have all the pieces in place for another one of those whimsical, comic British slices of life. But the movie doesn't quite deliver the way we think it will. One problem is that the Michael Caine character, sympathetic and funny in the opening and middle scenes, turns mean at the end for no good reason. Another is that the romance, and a manufactured crisis, distract from the true climax of the movie. That would be Jane Horrocks' vocal performance [...] she is amazing. Absolutely fabulous.\"\n\nIn \"Variety\", Derek Elley called the film \"a small picture with a big heart\", adding, \"The film has almost everything going for it, with the exceptions of a somewhat lopsided structure in which the climax comes two-thirds of the way through and a romantic subplot that plays like an afterthought. Nevertheless, smooth direction by Mark Herman and juicy performances by a host of Brit character actors [...] ensure an entertaining ride [...] Horrocks, whose combo of gamin physique and big vocal talent make the title role seem unthinkable for any other actress, is a revelation, handling moments of solo emotion and onstage strutting with equal, moving panache.\"\n\n\n"}

In 1933, after the National Socialists came to power in Germany, she was, as all Jews were, banned from playing in public and could only appear in concerts of the \"Jüdischer Kulturbund\" (Jewish Culture Association).\n\nWith Buhlig's help, Sultan fled Germany in 1941 via Lisbon, from where she emigrated to the United States by ship. She settled in New York City and took up piano teaching, first at Vassar College and the 92nd Street Y, then at the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, New York. In the mid-1940s she met the composer John Cage and became good friends with him, and it was through Sultan that Cage met one of her students, Christian Wolff, who gave Cage his first copy of the \"I Ching\"—a book that shaped Cage's composition methods during the subsequent decades.\n\nCage dedicated two pieces to Sultan. The first was part of his \"Music for Piano\" series, \"Music for Piano 53–68\". In 1974, when Sultan was in the process of learning Cage's \"Music of Changes\", the composer offered to write some new music for her, and the result was a monumental piano cycle, \"Etudes Australes\". Sultan made the premiere recording of the work and played it in concerts worldwide. She also performed the music of Alan Hovhaness and Tui St. George Tucker, but contemporary composers were not the only ones that interested her: in the 1940s she helped popularize Bach's \"Goldberg Variations\", and her concert programs included music from Beethoven, Chopin, and Schubert to Stravinsky, Earle Brown and Morton Feldman.\n\nGrete Sultan gave her last recital in 1996, aged 90, at New York's Merkin Concert Hall, performing Bach's \"Goldberg Variations\".

For the rule to be satisfied, the short must be either at a price above the last traded price of the security, or at the last traded price when the most recent movement between traded prices was upward (i.e. the security has traded below the last-traded price more recently than above that price).\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defined the rule, and summarized it:\n\"\"Rule 10a-1(a)(1)\" provided that, subject to certain exceptions, a listed security may be sold short (A) at a price above the price at which the immediately preceding sale was effected (plus tick), or (B) at the last sale price if it is higher than the last different price (zero-plus tick). Short sales were not permitted on minus ticks or zero-minus ticks, subject to narrow exceptions.\"\n\nThe rule went into effect in 1938 and was removed when \"Rule 201 Regulation SHO\" became effective in 2007. In 2009, the reintroduction of the uptick rule was widely debated, and proposals for a form of its reintroduction by the SEC went into a public comment period on 2009-04-08. A modified form of the rule was adopted on 2010-02-24.\n\nIn 1938, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted the uptick rule, more formally known as \"rule 10a-1\", after conducting an inquiry into the effects of concentrated short selling during the market break of 1937. The original rule was implemented when Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. was SEC commissioner.\n\nIn 1994, the NASD and Nasdaq adopted their own short sale price tests, known as NASD Rule 3350, based on the last bid rather than on the last reported sale.\n\nIn 1978, the purpose of the uptick rule was described in a standard text \"It was not unusual [prior to 1934] to discover groups of speculators pooling their capital and selling short for the sole purpose of driving down the stock price of a particular security to a level where the stockholders would panic and unload their fully owned shares. This, in turn, caused even greater declines in value.\"\n\n\"In 2004, the Commission initiated a year-long pilot that eliminated short sale price test restrictions from approximately one-third of the largest stocks. The purpose of the pilot was to study how the removal of such short sale price test restrictions impacted the market for those subject securities.\n\nShort sale data was made publicly available during this pilot to allow the public and Commission staff to study the effects of eliminating short sale price test restrictions. Third-party researchers analyzed the publicly available data and presented their findings in a public Roundtable discussion in September 2006. The Commission staff also studied the pilot data extensively and made its findings available in draft form in September 2006, and final form in February 2007.\n\nAt the time the SEC acted in 2007, two different types of price tests covered significant numbers of securities. The Nasdaq \"bid\" test, based on the national best bid, covered approximately 2,900 Nasdaq securities in 2005 (or 44 million short sales). The SEC's former uptick test (former Rule 10a-1), based on the last sale price, covered approximately 4,000 exchange-listed securities (or 68 million short sales).\"\n\nEffective July 3, 2007, the Commission eliminated former Rule 10a-1 and added Rule 201 of Regulation SHO, prohibiting any SRO from having a short sale price test. The SEC concluded from the study cited above: \"The general consensus from these analyses and the roundtable was that the Commission should remove price test restrictions because they modestly reduce liquidity and do not appear necessary to prevent manipulation. In addition, the empirical evidence did not provide strong support for extending a price test to either small or thinly-traded securities not currently subject to a price test.\"\n\nIn addition, the Commission stated its belief that the amendments would bring increased\nuniformity to short sale regulation, level the playing field for market participants, and remove an\nopportunity for regulatory arbitrage.\n\nCommenting on the scrapping of the uptick rule, \"The Economist\" reported that \"short-sellers argue [it] was largely symbolic, and it remains in place at only a few of the world's big stock exchanges.\"\n\nOn August 27, 2007, the \"New York Times\" published an article on Muriel Siebert, former state banking superintendent of New York, \"Wall Street veteran and financial sage\", and, in 1967, the first woman to become a member of the New York Stock Exchange. In this article she expressed severe concerns about market volatility: \"We've never seen volatility like this. We're watching history being made.\" Siebert pointed to the uptick rule, saying, \"The S.E.C. took away the short-sale rule and when the markets were falling, institutional investors just pounded stocks because they didn't need an uptick.\"\n\nOn March 28, 2008 Jim Cramer of CNBC offered the opinion that the absence of the uptick rule harms the stock market today. He claimed that reintroducing the uptick rule would help stabilize the banking sector.\n\nOn July 3, 2008 Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, an adviser on mergers and acquisitions, said short-selling was at record levels and asked the SEC to take urgent action and reinstate the 70-year-old uptick rule. On November 20, 2008, they renewed their call stating \"Decisive action cannot await ... a new S.E.C. Chairman. ... There is no tomorrow. The failure to reinstate the Uptick Rule is not acceptable.\" \n\nOn July 16, 2008, Congressman Gary Ackerman (D-NY), Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) and Congressman Mike Capuano (D-MA) introduced H.R. 6517, \"A bill to require the Securities and Exchange Commission to reinstate the uptick rule on short sales of securities.\"\n\nOn September 18, 2008, presidential candidate and Senator John McCain (R-AZ) said that the SEC allowed short-selling to turn \"our markets into a casino.\" McCain criticized the SEC and its Chairman for eliminating the uptick rule.\n\nOn October 6, 2008, Erik Sirri, director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Trading and Markets, said that the SEC is considering bringing back the uptick rule, stating, \"It's something we have talked about and it may be something that we in fact do.\"\n\nOn October 17, 2008, the New York Stock Exchange reported a survey with 85% of its members being in favor of reinstating the uptick rule with the dominant reason to \"help instill market confidence\".\n\nOn November 18, 2008, the \"Wall Street Journal\" published an opinion editorial by Robert Pozen and Yaneer Bar-Yam describing an analysis of the difference between regulated and unregulated stocks during the SEC pilot program. By using an analysis they claimed to be more comprehensive than the SEC's original study, they showed that unregulated stocks have lower returns, with a difference that is both statistically and economically significant. They also reported that twice as many stocks had greater than 40% drops in corresponding 12 month periods before and after the repeal.\nOn January 20, 2009, Ackerman received a letter from Chairman Cox—written the day he left the SEC—in which Cox said he supports the reinstatement of an uptick rule. The letter reads, \"I have been interested in proposing an updated uptick rule. However, as you know, the SEC is a commission of five members. Throughout 2008 there was not a majority interested in reconsidering the 2007 decision to repeal the uptick rule, or in proposing some modernized variant of it. I sincerely hope that the commission, in the year ahead, continues to reassess this issue in light of the extraordinary market events of the last several months, with a view to implementing a modernized version of the uptick rule.\"\n\nOn February 25, 2009, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee stated he favored the SEC examining restoring the uptick-rule.\n\nOn March 10, 2009, the SEC and Congressman Barney Frank (D-MA), Chairman of the Financial Services Committee announced plans to restore the uptick rule. Frank said he was hopeful that it would be restored within a month.\n\nA paper from the \"New England Complex Systems Institute\" claims that they have found evidence that suggests the 2008 financial crisis was triggered by a \"Bear Raid\" market manipulation by short sellers against Citigroup late in 2007. The uptick rule was repealed in July, 2007, and the alleged bear raid took place in November, 2007.\n\nThis paper has an addendum based on additional data provided by the NYSE for short sells during the time period that in fact the uptick rule would not have prevented what occurred. To quote the paper directly:\n\nThe new information we received implies that the sale of borrowed shares reflected in the increase in borrowed shares on November 1 and the corresponding decrease on November 7 may have been done in a way that would not have been prevented by the uptick rule. A more detailed inquiry into the means by which such selling could have been done is beyond the current work.\n\nOn April 8, 2009, the SEC voted to seek public comment on the following proposals to restore a form of the uptick rule.\n\nThe SEC disclosed the 273 page text of the proposals on April 17, 2009. The comment period closed on June 19, 2009.\n\n\"Market-Wide, Permanent Approach:\"\n\"Security-Specific, Temporary Approach:\"\n\nOn February 24, 2010 the SEC adopted the alternative uptick rule, by amending Rules 200(g) and 201 of Regulation SHO [17 CFR 242.200(g) and 17 CFR 242.201] under the Exchange Act. The new rule does not apply to all securities. It is triggered when a security's price decreases by 10% or more from the previous day's closing price and is effective until the close of the next day.\n\nSpecifically Rule 201(b) has the following amendments:\n\n(b) (1) A trading center shall establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and\nprocedures reasonably designed to:\n\n(i) Prevent the execution or display of a short sale order of a covered security at a price\nthat is less than or equal to the current national best bid if the price of that covered security\ndecreases by 10% or more from the covered security's closing price as determined by the listing\nmarket for the covered security as of the end of regular trading hours on the prior day; and\n\n(ii) Impose the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for the remainder of the\nday and the following day when a national best bid for the covered security is calculated and\ndisseminated on a current and continuing basis by a plan processor pursuant to an effective\nnational market system plan.\n\n(iii) Provided, however, that the policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to\npermit:\n\n(A) The execution of a displayed short sale order of a covered security by a trading center\nif, at the time of initial display of the short sale order, the order was at a price above the current\nnational best bid; and\n\n(B) The execution or display of a short sale order of a covered security marked \"short\nexempt\" without regard to whether the order is at a price that is less than or equal to the current\nnational best bid.\n\nHong Kong traditionally had no uptick rule, a situation depicted in James Clavell's novel \"Noble House\".\nThey instituted one following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.\n\nGordon J. Alexander and Mark A. Peterson, in an academic study of the uptick rule, found \"the execution quality of short-sell orders is adversely affected by the Uptick Rule, even when stocks are trading in advancing markets. This is inconsistent with one of the three stated objectives of the rule, i.e., to allow relatively unrestricted short selling when a firm's stock is advancing so that the rule does not affect price discovery during such times.\"\n\nKarl B. Diether, Kuan-Hui Lee, and Ingrid M. Werner stated in their study: \"The results suggest that the effect of the price-tests on market quality can largely be attributed to the distortions in order flow created by the price-tests in the first place. Therefore, we believe that the price-tests can safely be permanently suspended.\"\n\nOne empirical study found no statistically significant link between the uptick rule and the rates of price decline.\n\nA 2006 study by Alexander and Peterson found no substantial differences between stocks subjected to the rule and those that were not.\n\nWhile the market experienced a brief upward trend when the rule first became effective in February 1938, it ultimately continued the broad decline that had begun in 1937—though the fact that the market suffers a short-term decline does not necessarily establish that the rule is ineffective in contributing to long-term market confidence.\n"}

When on, keys F1 to F12 behave as applicable, with meanings defined by the application being used at the time.

First, the behaviour was unintuitive: Pressing a key such as F4 by default no longer had its normal meaning, so combinations such as appeared not to work.\n\nSecondly, the choice of secondary function assigned to each key appeared to be arbitrary: whereas F7 was the traditional key for spell-check (used notably by Microsoft itself in its Office products), F7 was assigned the function of \"reply\", and spell-check was assigned to F10. This caused strong criticism from some commentators.\n\nPressing F2 in Windows Explorer in attempt to rename a file would instead undo an earlier file operation, with potentially disastrous consequences if the actual effect went silently unnoticed.\n\nBecause of such concerns, a number of methods for disabling the F-Lock function appeared on the web.\n\nMany Windows/PC users have found a workaround using Microsoft's Intellitype Pro software, which allows a user to assign keystrokes/macros to the function and accessory keys.

{"id": "2193537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193537", "title": "OK gesture", "text": "OK gesture\n\nThe OK or ring gesture (Unicode symbol U+1F44C \"👌\") is performed by connecting the thumb and index into a circle, and holding the other fingers straight or relaxed away from the palm. Commonly used by divers, it signifies \"I am OK\" or \"Are you OK?\" when underwater. In most English-speaking countries it denotes approval, agreement, and that all is well or \"okay\". In other contexts or cultures, similar gestures may have different meanings or connotations including those that are negative, offensive, financial, numerical, devotional, political, or purely linguistic.\n\nRing gestures, formed by forefinger and thumb with remaining digits extended, appear in Greece at least as early as the fifth century BCE, and can be seen on painted vases as an expression of love, with thumb and forefinger mimicking kissing lips. When proffered by one person toward another in Ancient Greece, the gesture was of one professing their love for another, and the sentiment was conveyed more in the touching of fingertips than in the ring that they formed. As an expression of assent and approval, the gesture can be traced back to first century Rome where the rhetorician Quintilian is recorded as having used it. Quintilian's \"chironomy\" prescribed variations in context for the gesture's use during specific points of a speech: to open, give warning or praise or accusation, and then to close a declamation.\n\nContemporaneously the sign appeared throughout the Buddhist and Hindu diasporas as a symbol of inner perfection. Ethologist Desmond Morris posits that the joined thumb-and-forefinger communicates precision in grasping something literally or figuratively, and that the shape formed by their union represents the epitome of perfection—a circle—hence the gesture's transcultural message that things are \"exactly right\" or \"perfect\".\n\nIn Naples the gesture has been long used to symbolize love and matrimony, as was custom in neighboring Greece, but specifically with the palm upturned, while the gesture made with a downturned palm represents a hand holding the scales of justice. Across Italy the gesture remained in use as one for making points in conversation when moved about to express discursive precision, but when held still in an upright position with fingers jutting skyward, it became an emblem of perfection.\n\nEarly records of the sign's usage in the English-speaking world date to British physician-philosopher John Bulwer's 1644 \"Chirologia\", \"The naturall language of the hand composed of the speaking motions, and discoursing gestures thereof.\" Among the many hand gestures detailed by Bulwer, he described one as \"The top of the fore-finger moved to joyne with the naile of the Thumbe that's next to it, the other fingers in remitter,\" and said that it was \"opportune for those who relate, distinguish, or approve\".\n\nBy the early 19th century in the United States, the gesture was affiliated with the letters \"O\" (formed by the circle) and \"K\" (derived from the extended fingers). While it is not known exactly how the OK gesture and the corresponding verbal expression coalesced, the English professor Allen Walker Read dates the expression's rise in usage to an 1839 humor piece in the \"Boston Morning Post\" describing the expression \"o.k.\" as meaning \"all correct,\" suggesting comically misspelled initials, at a time when acronyms for misspelled words were in vogue. Several other broadsheets in Boston, New York and Philadelphia ran with the expression in their own columns, some with misspellings of \"all correct\" such as \"oll korrect\", bringing the phrase into the vernacular of American English. \n\nThe following year Democrats took to using the phrase and its accompanying gesture in support of president Martin Van Buren's campaign for reelection. A native of Kinderhook, New York, Van Buren was widely known by his nickname, \"Old Kinderhook\", whose initials, \"O.K.\", were steadily gaining traction as an expression of approval. In New York City, fans of Van Buren formed the O.K. Democratic Club and used the gesture as its sign, with the slogan of \"O.K.\" bearing the double meaning in the club's catchphrase, \"Old Kinderhook is all correct.\" Both phrase and gesture made their way into newspapers around the country via political cartoons, thus further spreading the expression. After Van Buren's defeat to William Henry Harrison, O.K. was briefly satirized as meaning \"Ofrul Kalamity\" or \"Orful Katastrophe\".\n\nDespite Van Buren's loss and the subsequent dissolution of the O.K. Democratic Club, the gesture has since been widely used since to mean \"all is well\" or \"good\" in the United States. As a gesture, its connotation is more positive than the word \"OK,\" which may mean a thing is merely satisfactory or mediocre, as in, \"The food was OK.\" The gesture is commonly understood as a signal of approval, and is sometimes used synonymously with the Western \"thumbs up\" gesture.\n\nIn the communication used by scuba divers, the OK sign is specific in its meaning that \"everything is OK\" as regulated by the Recreational Scuba Training Council. Divers are taught to always use this sign and not the thumbs up gesture because the latter means that a diver needs to ascend. The gesture is also used as a means of checking in, with one diver using it to ask another, \"Everything OK?\" and the response meaning, \"Yes, everything is OK.\"\n\nAt distances where the standard OK gesture may be hard to see, divers use larger signals as an alternative, either with one hand atop the head and the elbow bent out to the side, or with both hands touching above the head so that the arms form an \"O\" for \"OK\". This full-body gesture is also used as \"OK\" in Japan where the single-handed gesture connotes monetary transactions instead of meaning \"OK\". This two-armed OK gesture was added to Unicode in 2010 under the name \"Face With OK Gesture\" (U+1F646 \"🙆\") and became part of Emoji 1.0 in 2015.\n\nIn Japan, the one-handed ring gesture is used to symbolize money, and in this context the fingers' circular shape represents a coin. Sometimes the sign is used to avoid the verbal awkwardness in talking about or asking for money. In other contexts, it can be used to imply a bribe or other illicit financial transactions, or signal an invitation to enter into business negotiations.\n\nIn other parts of the world the gesture can also express money, financial transactions, wealth or the priciness of an item. Records of the gesture being used to remark on a person's wealth or status are documented as practiced in Mexico during the late nineteenth century.\n\nIn yoga the gesture is known as \"chin mudra\" (\"the seal of consciousness\") when the palm is face down, or \"jnana mudra\" (\"the seal of wisdom\") when the palm is face up or held in other positions, such as in front of the heart. Some schools of yoga use \"chin\" and \"jnana mudra\" interchangeably, while others claim that \"the former produces a subtle feeling of rootedness, the latter a sense of lightness,\" or that \"jnana\" \"the passive receiving position\" while \"chin\" \"is an actively giving position\". In these mudras the middle, ring, and little fingers represent the three gunas of \"rajas\", \"tamas\", and \"sattva\" which, when in harmony, unite \"ātman\" and \"brahman\", or the individual soul and universal soul. The pressing together of the thumb and forefinger represents that union—or \"yoga\"—of consciousness. In Buddhism the gesture is called vitarka mudra (\"the seal of discussion\") and is used to emphasize the meaning of words.\n\nWhile widespread use of the OK gesture has granted it an international connotation of assent, it also bears negative, vulgar, or offensive meanings in many regions of the world. In contrast to Japan's use of the expression to represent coins and wealth, the gesture's \"O\" shape stands for \"zero\" meaning \"worth nothing\" in France and Tunisia. In many Mediterranean countries such as Turkey, Tunisia, and Greece, as well as in the Middle East, parts of Germany, and many parts of Latin America, the gesture may be interpreted as a vulgar expression resembling a human anus, referring to sex, either as an insult (\"You are an asshole\"), or a homophobic reaction to a symbol of homosexuality and the act of sodomy. In Brazil it can be synonymous with giving someone the middle finger.\n\nIn Kuwait and other parts of the Arab world, this sign represents the evil eye and is used as a curse, sometimes in conjunction with verbal condemnation.\n\nIn some regions of the world, both the positive \"OK\" and the negative forms are practiced, which can lead to confusion over which meaning is intended. In regions and cultures where the gesture has a historically negative connotation, its use as an \"OK sign\" is often the result of its appearance in media and tends to be used more by younger people. In France, where widespread use has seeped in through American culture, the gesture's positive \"OK\" sentiment became popular in the north of the country while its negative connotation as \"worthless\" remained in the south. To avoid confusion, French communicators have become accustomed to using additional context clues, such as posture or facial expression, to clarify meaning. In other circumstances, the gesture's varied meanings are less easily reconciled, as was the case in 1950s Brazil when United States Vice President Richard Nixon emerged from his airplane displaying the sign with each hand. While Nixon's intent was to communicate good will to the people of São Paulo, the crowd received it with offense.\n\nSince the 1980s, the OK gesture has been the key feature of the popular school prank, \"the circle game\". A person initiating the game makes the gesture palm-inward below their own waistline and tries to trick an opponent into looking at it. If the person looks at it, the maker of the gesture punches the opponent in the arm. Variations exist where a player who can insert their own index finger into the circle without looking at it may punch the circle-maker. In November 2000, the gesture gained widespread use when the circle game was a plot feature in an episode of the sitcom \"Malcolm in the Middle\". In a much earlier version (1950s), the circle was placed over the maker's elbow, or any body part.\n\nIn 2017, users on the message-board site 4chan aimed to convince the media that the OK gesture was being used as a white power movement symbol. According to \"The Boston Globe\", users on 4chan's /pol/ (\"Politically Incorrect\") board were instructed in February 2017 to \"flood Twitter and other social media websites...claiming that the OK hand sign is a symbol of white supremacy,\" as part of a campaign dubbed \"Operation O-KKK\".The association of the gesture with white supremacy derived from the assertion that the three upheld fingers resemble a 'W' and the circle made with the thumb and forefinger resemble the head of a 'P', together standing for \"White Power\" (when performed with left hand). While some members of the alt-right used the symbol after the launch of the 4chan campaign, it remained ambiguous whether or not it was being used to communicate genuine adherence to white supremacy, or with deliberately ironic motives. According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL):\n\nThe ADL describes the symbol as a \"trolling gesture\" the use of which began to increase in April 2017. According to the ADL, by 2019 some white supremacists had begun using the OK symbol \"as a sincere expression of White Supremacy\". Many white supremacists have acknowledged using the left hand symbol as a gesture of White Power. A number of people have been accused of genuine use of the sign in support for white-supremacist ideology:\n\nMost sign languages combine hand shapes, movement, and position in relation to the rest of body, as well as additional body language and facial expression. As with other hand signs, the OK gesture may be combined with other elements to convey numerous meanings across multiple sign languages.\n\nDating back to the tenth century in Europe, the gesture of thumb and forefinger forming a ring with the remaining fingers extended was used in a set of standardized ecclesiastical signs employed by Christian monks under vows of silence to represent numerous religious rites and objects. For example, when held out in front of oneself the gesture represented an oblation to God. When touched to the mouth it meant taking a meal. When added to the open-palmed sign for \"book\" it specified a hymnal, and the sign's O-shape represented the signing of an \"O\" that began many hymns. If the thumb and forefinger took hold of a specific part of one's own clothing or body such as the hood of a cowl, a lock of hair, or skin on the left hand, the gesture could stand for things as diverse as \"monk\" or \"horse\" or \"parchment\".\n\nIn North American Plains Indian Sign Language (PISL), the gesture signifies the Sun when held up in front of the face or moved in an arc following the Sun's track. When held up to the sky and peered through, it is the sign for high noon. A PISL primer printed in an 1888 issue of the Canadian residential school newspaper \"Our Forest Children\" specifies that the left hand be used to indicate sunrise and the right for sunset. A more complicated series of movements with hands held in the gesture as if drawing a thread or stretching an elastic can signify death, or more specifically, \"After a long time, you die.\"\n\nIn modern-day American Sign Language (ASL) the gesture can mean many different things depending on how it is applied. The pinching action of the thumb-and-forefinger frequently represents something small. For example, the sign for \"housefly\" is made by making the gesture mimic a fly buzzing around. In ASL the gesture can also communicate a selection of some sort: When moved from one side to the other as if picking something up and placing it down, it means \"appoint\". When the joined thumb and forefinger of the gesture are placed into a hole made by the opposite hand, it means \"vote\". The sign for \"elect\" is formed by making the signs for \"vote\" and \"appoint\" in succession.\n\nIn deaf culture, the sign of joined thumb and forefinger takes on various letters in different systems of fingerspelling. The American manual alphabet reserves it for the letter F, while in both Irish and French Sign Language it is the letter G. In fingerspellings that represent Cyrillic alphabetical systems, such as the Ukrainian manual alphabet, the gesture represents the vowel O and reflects that letter's shape. Similarly, the Korean manual alphabet uses the gesture for the Hangul letter \"ㅇ\", romanized as \"ng\" to reflect its pronunciation in spoken Korean. In \"yubimoji\" (指文字 ), Japan's manual syllabary whose 45 signs and four diacritics represent the phonemes of the Japanese language, the gesture is the syllable \"\"me\"\" (め in hiragana, メ in katakana). Various fingerspelling systems may call for other specific features of the gesture beyond its joined thumb-and-forefinger with remaining fingers entended. For example, the ring in yubimoji's \"me\" gesture is slightly tapered rather than rounded.\nIn American Sign Language the OK gesture represents the number 9 when held in a stationary position with the palm facing away from the signer. This ASL numerical sign is the last in a sequence of single-digit integers where quantities of fingers denote the numbers 1 through 5, and then the thumb touches each finger in turn to denote 6 (pinky finger), 7 (ring finger), 8 (middle finger), and finally 9 (index finger). When shaken from left to right the sign for the number 9 becomes the number 19.\n\nIn Plains Indian Sign Language the gesture signifies the number 3 when held a bit lower than the signs used to represent the sun. Regional forms of finger counting used in China also employ the raised middle, ring and pinky fingers to express the number 3, either with thumb and index fingers joined as they are in the OK gesture or in a similar configuration. This number gesture is primarily used in China's southern provinces, while in the north 3 may also be expressed by the raised index, middle, and ring fingers as it is in English-speaking countries. Both methods are distinct from having the thumb, index and middle fingers extended as is used to denote 3 in much of mainland Europe, because this represents the number 8 in both Taiwan and parts of mainland China.\n\nGreco-Roman \"chironomia\" also included a counting system in which the ring gesture stood for either 10, 30, 100, or 300, the exact number being determined by which hand was used and the exact point of contact between thumb and forefinger.\n\nThe gesture was given prominence in the 1967 British television series \"The Prisoner\", in which a number of unnamed characters are held captive in a village. Whenever these imprisoned villagers would take leave of each other, they did so with the phrase \"Be seeing you\", accompanied by the gesture held up in front of their own eye as a reminder that despite any pretenses of freedom, they were all prisoners. The gesture is also used as a greeting in the show without the \"be seeing you\" phrase. The series' lead actor Patrick McGoohan stated that the show had adopted the gesture from the sign of the fish used by early Christians.\nIn 2010, South Indian film director Upendra Rao made a cinematic comeback with a film that fans called \"Super\", but whose actual title was \"👌\". Rao himself starred in his film as a non-resident Indian who returns to his homeland to turn the nation into a utopian society. In depicting the film's title only as a hand symbol, Rao's intent was for the audience to name it, thinking that they might call it \"Zero\" or \"Three,\" or associate it with Vitarka Mudra or the symbol for \"om\" (ॐ). During the film's opening credit sequence, the Vitarka Mudra title transforms into a hand pointing at the viewer announcing the name of the director as \"U\".\n\nIn Europe's Balkan region the OK gesture is known as the United Macedonia Salute in its association with irredentist campaigns for a united Macedonia. For Macedonian nationalists the two fingers forming the \"O\" stand for the Macedonian word \"Обединета\" (\"Obedineta\", meaning \"United\"), and the other three fingers symbolize the regions of Aegean Macedonia in northern Greece, Pirin Macedonia in southwestern Bulgaria, and the region of Vardar Macedonia that roughly corresponds to the Republic of North Macedonia's 21st century borders. Taken together, the United Macedonia Salute also resembles the Vergina Sun that was the royal symbol of Ancient Macedonia. Both Sun and Salute became popular among Macedonian Greeks in the 1980s, and the Sun appeared on the Macedonian flag after the Republic of Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. Three years later Macedonia changed its flag under economic pressure from Greece, which saw the use of the Vergina Sun as a threat against Greek sovereignty. The United Macedonia Salute remains controversial among many people in the Balkan region, especially those living within parts of Greece or Bulgaria that Macedonian nationalists wish to claim as provinces for the Republic.\n\nThe gesture is used by doctors to test functionality of the anterior interosseous nerve and seek indications of median nerve palsy in the hands. When performing the test, a patient makes the OK gesture with both hands. If the circle formed by one hand appears more pinched or less round than the other, it may indicate weakness in the nerve.\n\nA similar medical test, known as Froment's sign, is used to test for palsy on the ulnar nerve. To perform the test, a patient holds a piece of paper between their forefinger and thumb, and the examiner attempts to pull it out of the patient's grip. If ulnar nerve palsy is present, the patient will have difficulty maintaining their hold and may compensate by flexing the thumb to add more pressure.\n\nThe gesture has been used as a design element in several corporate and organizational logos. These include the Piramal Group, Bharat Petroleum, and Adlabs Studios, all headquartered in India. Piramal Group CEO Ajay Piramal told the press that \"The Group's values are rooted in tradition. They have been derived from three guiding principles in the \"Bhagavad Gita\": Gyan Yoga (the principle of knowledge and learning), Karma Yoga (the principle of dynamic action and entrepreneurial spirit) and Bhakti Yoga (the principle of care, compassion and devotion to a higher purpose).\" Piramal stated that the three fingers in the logo symbolize the mind, the body and the intellect in alignment with the Group's core values of \"Knowledge, Action and Care\" that subtitle the corporation's logo. In contrast to this, Bharat Petroleum began using the OK gesture as its own logo in 2002 with its \"Pure for Sure\" initiative to indicate that petrol filling stations and trucks transporting gasoline had been audited and approved as selling pure, undiluted fuel, and that customers could trust that what they were buying had been \"okayed\".\n\n"}

It is also streamed on the internet at wmuc.umd.edu and through the WMUC Radio app.\n\nWMUC had its first beginning in 1942 when student-run Old Line Network began daily broadcasts. Gilbert Cullen, with the help of George Reynolds, built the first University of Maryland campus radio station. Broadcasts were limited to the campus, so the station did not require an FCC license to operate. This became the fifth student-run campus station on the east coast. However, the station shut down January 1943 when most of its technical personnel were enlisted in the armed forces. The station re-launched in January using the call letters WMUC. The first WMUC broadcast aired October 11, 1948, but was shut down three days later due to transmission issues. The station relocated from the Speech Department to Silvester Hall in spring 1950, but in the fall, relocated again to a renovated shower stall in Calvert Hall where it remained until 1953. In 1953, WMUC moved to the old Journalism building (better known as Temporary Building FF) in a low-lying area of campus called \"the gulch,\" where it stayed for over 20 years. Finally, the station relocated to the third floor of South Campus Dining Hall in fall 1974, where it currently resides.\n\nWMUC received its FM license in 1979 after a two-year \"FM or Bust\" campaign, airing as a 10-watt FM station for the first time on September 10, 1979. It adopted the freeform format in 1982 so DJs could promote underground artists and music that is underrepresented by commercial radio. The WMUC-AM 650 remained Top-40 format.\n\nWMUC (AM) gained credibility in the Washington, D.C. radio broadcasting job market, providing announcers and managerial talent to many local stations. Though primarily funded by student fees, it also generated revenue through advertising of local and national concerns. In this era, WMUC \"acquired its first news network affiliation, saw Anne Edwards appointed as the first female station manager and, in 1965, was selected by the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System to receive the \"All-American College Radio Station\" Award\". In the mid 70s, programming broadened to include shows aimed at black and minority students and promoting feminism. Waning listenership and increasing maintenance of the campus-only carrier-current system caused the shutdown of AM in 1999. In its place, the online service WMUC Digital was created.\n\nIn 2012, the University Libraries' establishment of the Digital Conversion and Media Reformatting Center (DCMR) facilitated the process of archiving and digitizing the station schedules, staff lists, policies, forms, flyers, zines, photos, awards, correspondence, reports, newspaper clippings, and manuals. The WMUC Collection is now a \"permanent and growing part of the University Archives\" and is available for public research. \"Saving College Radio: WMUC Past, Present, and Future\" was exhibited in Hornbake Library September 2013 to July 2014.\n\nWMUC-FM is true freeform radio, where the DJs themselves determine the programming of the station. An elected student Program Director assigns weekly timeslots on the station to individual DJs, who are then responsible for programming, hosting, and promoting their respective shows. The schedule changes each semester, with the goal of offering a fresh perspective and diverse lineup of music and talk shows created by students at the University of Maryland.\n\nIn 2008, WMUC launched WMUC-2, a separate internet-only radio station which, like WMUC-FM, features freeform music and talk programming. Intended as a \"proving ground\" for new DJs, WMUC-2 also features programs which may not be appropriate for broadcast under FCC rules.\n\nWMUC also has an active Sports department, which maintains its own website and internet stream at wmucsports.net. WMUC Sports features a regular schedule of talk radio shows as well as on-air play-by-play and color analysis of Maryland sporting events. Calling 10 different sports, WMUC Sports is the primary carrier of Maryland men's soccer, women's basketball, baseball, women's lacrosse, field hockey, and softball.\n\nIn the past, WMUC had an active News department, which was integrated with the former Radio Television and Film department at the University of Maryland. WMUC's news programming is now coordinated by the Philip Merrill College of Journalism, via the student-produced news segment, Terp Weekly Edition.\n\nWMUC has a weekly live music program called Third Rail Radio (named after the electrically charged third rail of the DC Metro system), started in 1996 by Eric Speck. Third Rail Radio hosts many local and traveling independent bands and musicians. In 2004, the program produced a compilation CD of artists who have appeared on the program.\n\nIn addition to Third Rail Radio, there are many in-studio performances. In the past, these have included Louis Armstrong, Linda Ronstadt, the Kingston Trio, Don McLean, the Ramones, Duran Duran, and Elliott Smith. Recently, Beach House, Future Islands, Logic, Matt & Kim, King Tuff, Kurt Vile, Vivian Girls, Alvvays, Surfer Blood, and Mitski have performed at WMUC.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2193564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193564", "title": "Agon", "text": "Agon\n\nAgon (Classical Greek ) is an ancient Greek term for a conflict, struggle or contest. This could be a contest in athletics, in chariot or horse racing, or in music or literature at a public festival in ancient Greece. Agon is the word-forming element in 'agony', explaining the concept of agon(y) in tragedy by its fundamental characters, the protagonist and antagonist.\n\nIn one sense, agon meant a contest or a competition in athletics, for example, the Olympic Games (Ὀλυμπιακοὶ Ἀγῶνες). Agon was also a mythological personification of the contests listed above. This god was represented in a statue at Olympia with \"halteres\" (dumbbells) () in his hands. This statue was a work of Dionysius, and dedicated by Micythus of Rhegium.\n\nAgon also referred to a challenge that was held in connection with religious festivals. With a further religious meaning as used in 1 Timothy 6:12 in the New Testament and defined by Strong's Concordance as, agón: a gathering, contest, struggle; as an (athletic) contest; hence, a struggle (in the soul).\n\nIn Ancient Greek drama, particularly Old Comedy (fifth century B.C.), agon refers to a contest or debate between two characters - the prot\"agonist\" and the ant\"agonist\" - in the highly structured Classical tragedies and dramas. The agon could also develop between an actor and the choir or between two actors with half of the chorus supporting each. Through the argument of opposing principles, the agon in these performances resembled the dialectic dialogues of Plato. The meaning of the term has escaped the circumscriptions of its classical origins to signify, more generally, the conflict on which a literary work turns.\n\nIn 1948, Lincoln Kirstein posed the idea of a ballet that would later become known as \"Agon\". After ten years of work before \"Agon\"'s premiere, it became the final ballet in a series of collaborations between choreographer George Balanchine and composer Igor Stravinsky. Balanchine referred to this ballet as \"the most perfect work\" to come out of the collaboration between Stravinsky and himself.\n\nHarold Bloom in \"The Western Canon\" uses the term \"agon\" to refer to the attempt by a writer to resolve an intellectual conflict between his ideas and the ideas of an influential predecessor in which \"the larger swallows the smaller\", such as in chapter 18, Joyce's agon with Shakespeare.\n\nIn \"Man, Play, and Games\" Roger Caillois uses the term Agon to define games of competitive nature.\n\nIn sociopolitical theory, agon can refer to the idea that the clash of opposing forces necessarily results in growth and progress.\n\nWords derived from \"agon\" include agony, agonism, antagonism, and protagonist.\n\n"}

His work was highly distinctive, wearing its design influences on its sleeve, daring to be two-dimensional and bold in its use of large expanses of flat, bold colours. This stood out particularly during the early 1990s, when British comics were leaning ever more towards fully painted art. Unusually, Hughes preferred to be his own letterer, and designed several unusual fonts for this purpose.\n\nSince leaving comics illustration, Hughes has become a successful advertising artist, graphic designer and font designer. He runs his own company, Device, with clients including Virgin Airways, Penguin Books, DC Comics, Eurostar the BBC and a range of magazines and newspapers. Hughes prefers to design his own fonts for new projects usually giving them humorous and occasionally rude names. The font \"Knobcheese\" was marketed as \"A typeface in the Swiss (cheese) tradition. With knobs on.\"\n\nHughes graduated from London College of Printing and was employed at various advertising agencies where he worked for \"ID magazine\", \"Smash Hits\" and Condé Nast. He arrived late at his very first job interview at an advertising agency with a lump of dog excrement stuck to the bottom of his portfolio, managed to transfer some of it on to the white shirt he was wearing and the rest onto the meeting-room table. Directors had to open windows to let the stench out. Despite this, he got the job. At the same time he was drawing his own comics, released as small press minicomics in editions of around 20 copies. Three issues of \"Zit\" were published between 1983 and 1984 and through these he got involved with the British small press comics scene of the time based around the Fast Fiction stall Paul Gravett was running at the Westminster Comic Mart in London.\n\nHughes was a regular contributor to Gravett's \"Escape \"from 1983 to 1989 with strips including \"Norm\" and \"The Inheritors\". In 1987 his first graphic novel, \"The Science Service\", co-written with John Freeman, was published by Belgian publishers Magic Strip in seven languages. The UK edition was co-published in 1989 by Acme Press in the UK and Eclipse Comics in the US.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s through to the present day, Hughes has been involved with design work for a wide range of comics publishers. He is responsible for the distinctive look of the Knockabout Books line of collected underground comics and periodicals from 1985 to 1992. By the early 1990s it seemed like every aspect of the British comics industry had Hughes' stamp on it, from the carrier bags at Forbidden Planet to the logo of Mega City Comics. In 1990 the strip Dare was drawn by Hughes, serialised in \"Revolver\", a magazine he designed, and written about in \"Speakeasy\", a news magazine he'd also redesigned.\n\nAt Fleetway he did influential work, designing a new display font for their weekly comic \"2000 AD\", under the supervision of innovative Art Director Steve Cook. When the adult comic \"Crisis\" was launched it featured a radical Hughes design and he continued to spearhead Fleetways identity with the launch of \"Revolver\" and their graphic novels line.\n\nFor Titan Books he was given the task of designing books that repackaged American comics for the UK market. Most notable was his work on Love and Rockets, a personal favourite of Hughes. His design was considered daring but the American publisher, Fantagraphics Books, was impressed and used similar concepts in their own collections.\n\nFor DC Comics Hughes has designed numerous logos and covers, initially for the Vertigo imprint where many British creators were working. Here he continued his collaboration with Grant Morrison, creating covers and identity for The Invisibles. He has also worked on covers for DC's superhero lines, notably the \"Tangent\" series of Elseworlds comics.\n\nOther notable design work for the comics industry includes the 1986 MTV Europe Awards booklet \"Outbreaks of Violets\", possibly the rarest Alan Moore title, late-era issues of \"Deadline\" where he worked on the entire magazine on a minimal budget in three days, and the retro covers for Flex Mentallo produced with artist Frank Quitely.\n\nHughes design output has broadened into work for clients in the music industry, advertising, toy industry and publishing.\n\nHughes recently completed artwork for Oxford-based rock group The Winchell Riots, designing the vinyl & CD sleeves for their 'Red Square EP' which is released September 2010.\n\nHughes' discovery of the Mac in 1993 pushed his illustration work in a more stylised graphic direction. Adopting first Freehand than Adobe Illustrator, he used expanses of flat colour and texture in asymmetric and dynamic layouts, his characters became more elegant and exaggerated, and the type, generally custom designed for each illustration, became an integral part of his imagemaking process. This very influential flat vector style has been dubbed \"Sans Ligne\" in reference to the European \"Ligne Claire\" school by artist Will Kane. Though enabled by the Macintosh, Hughes' considers his combination of design, illustration and typography to be a return to the working methods of the poster artists of the early 20th century, a period when artists like the Stenberg Brothers, Cassandre and Jean Carlu combined type, image and layout to achieve a dynamic, integrated whole.\n\nHughes illustration work includes title sequences for The Box, poster designs for Tokyo fashion company Jun Co.'s Yellow Boots chain, the animated on-board safety film for Virgin Airlines, Eurostar's poster campaign, a collection of Hawaiian shirts, a range for Swatch and the BBC's CD edition of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. In 2007 he collaborated with ex-Spice Girl Geri Halliwell on a series of six children's books, Ugenia Lavender.\n\nNow widely copied, the influence of Hughes' illustration style can be seen in advertising, on covers for mass-market women's paperbacks, children's books and editorial illustrations worldwide.\n\nHughes' has described typography as \"the particle physics of design\". Hughes' interest in letterforms began at an unusually young age thanks to a Letraset catalogue his architect father had lying about the studio. At 15 he visited Letraset, where he saw Rubylith being used for the first time to create type.\n\nThis is the technique he used in the early days of his career when producing custom type for his design work. Early fonts like FF CrashBangWallop and FF Revolver (originally designed for Speakeasy and Revolver magazine respectively) were digitisations of fonts originally done in this old-fashioned method of Rubylith on board.\n\nHis first fonts were released back in 1992 as part of the FontFont range, while subsequent designs have been released via his own foundry, Device Fonts.\n\nMany of Hughes' fonts were created for specific design commissions, and their names reflect their application or the circumstances of their conception. The chunky no-nonsense Judgement family was commissioned for \"2000 AD\", home of Judge Dredd. Metropol Noir, which was created specifically for the BDA Gold Award winning 1996 MTV Europe Music Awards programme is named after the Paris hotel Hughes was put up in for the event. Others are more descriptive; FF Knobcheese suggests a knobbly Swiss Cheese; Foonky and Laydeez Night derive from a kitsch 70s aesthetic.\n\nA retrospective catalogue \"Ten Year Itch\" was published in 2005 and features all Hughes' type designs up to that point.\n\n\"Comics work includes\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Sunscreem also has the rare reputation as a techno-based band that successfully performs concerts. Over a ten-year period, 12 of its singles made an entry to the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe nucleus of the group is lead vocalist/cellist/keyboardist Lucia Holm and fellow keyboardist Paul Carnell. The group has also, at times, included Darren Woodford, Rob Fricker, Sean Wright, Nick Slingsby (aka \"Bongo Ted\"), and DJ Dave Valentine.\n\nSunscreem released a 12\" promo of \"Love U More\" on the Sony Soho Square record label in 1991, a song that went on to spend two weeks at #1 on the U.S. Dance chart in March 1993. The group also had club hits in the UK with the singles \"Walk On\" and \"Pressure\" (also on Sony Soho Square) before releasing its successful first album \"O\" on multiple labels in 1993. Other singles from \"O\" included \"Perfect Motion\" and a cover of the Marianne Faithfull song \"Broken English.\"\n\n\"Love U More\" was one of the first techno songs to hit the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Top 40, climbing to No. 36 (to date it is their only Hot 100 entry). It was subsequently covered (usually in a bowdlerized form, omitting the climactic reference to rape and toning down other images in the lyrics) by other artists including Paul Elstak, LMP, Rollergirl, and Steps.\n\nThe band is known for having its songs remixed by a wide variety of dance music producers, including Leftfield, Band of Gypsies, Carl Cox, Push, Rollo Armstrong from Faithless, Red Jerry, Matt Darey, Slam, X-Press 2, Trouser Enthusiasts, Robbie Rivera, Jimmy Gomez, K-Klass, Armand Van Helden, and Fire Island (Pete Heller and Terry Farley) among others.\n\nAhead of its second album, the group released a variety of tracks under alternative names including a selection of 12-inch singles referred to as the Anna Series. This included the instrumental \"Angel Dub,\" which was credited to Anna Din, and was featured on many compilations such as \"\" by Sasha & John Digweed. These tracks were released independently, breaking the terms of their contract with Sony and leading to an increasingly strained relationship with the label.\n\nThe group's second album was called \"Change Or Die\", and from it, the band released the singles \"When\" (U.S. Dance #1), \"Exodus,\" \"White Skies,\" \"Secrets,\" and \"Looking at You\" (U.S. Dance #2). Despite all these singles, the album was not commercially released in major territories outside the UK, and the band therefore negotiated its release from its Sony Music contract. Their next release was a mainly instrumental limited-edition CD called \"New Dark Times\", issued on the band's own Kali label, which combined new material with tracks from the Anna Series and remixes from \"Change Or Die\".\n\nThe band subsequently signed with UK dance label Pulse-8. Its next single, \"Catch\" (U.K. Dance No. 1, U.S. Dance #2), was from an album titled \"Out of the Woods\", but the label went bankrupt in 1997 before its completion, along with some other challenges at the time this meant that the album and the second single \"Cover Me\" were never released on the Pulse-8 label. , though remixes of \"Cover Me\" by Trouser Enthusiasts appeared on compilations, and an unfinished version of the album was leaked online.\n\nSince then there have been a handful of releases and compilations such as the Sunscreem vs Push \"Please Save Me\" single (US Dance No. 26, UK Singles #40), and a re-release of \"Perfect Motion\" with new remixes by Starchaser and Way out West. In 2002, the group released \"Ten Mile Bank\", which combined new and remixed material in the manner of \"New Dark Times\", many of the tracks being club mixes of songs from the as yet unissued \"Out of the Woods\". Lead singer Lucia Holm released a promo called \"Heaven\" (a cover of the Psychedelic Furs song) to radio stations in 2005, but it was never fully published as a 'solo' work. The track is instead featured on \"Out of the Woods\" as a Sunscreem work.\n\nIn May 2015 Sunscreem played at a series of local events to promote their album \"Sweet Life\", which was released on iTunes.\n\nIn 2018 the band continued to perform live and this built up to \"Out of the Woods\" finally being released through the Annalogic label in November 2018.\n\n\n\nThe \"Anna series\" were issued on 12\" only. Variants of these tracks were subsequently issued (some under different titles) on \"Change Or Die\", \"New Dark Times\" and the \"Exodus\" single. \"Time Flies\" was an extended version of \"A Brief History of Nonsense\" from \"New Dark Times\", itself a radical remix of \"Exodus\".\n\nIn addition, DJs Darren Tate and Judge Jules had a hit in 2000 with \"It's My Turn\" credited to Angelic, which was their previously-issued remix of Sunscreem's \"Change\" with the original vocal track replaced with a new one by Jules' wife Amanda O'Riordan. The track reached number 11 in the UK singles chart.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2193582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193582", "title": "Al-Musta'li", "text": "Al-Musta'li\n\nAbu'l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Mustansir (; 16 September 1074 – 12 December 1101), better known by his regnal name al-Musta'li Billah (), was the ninth Fatimid caliph and the 19th imam of Musta'li Isma'ilism. \n\nHis accession was engineered by his brother-in-law, the vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah, who was the \"de facto\" ruler of the state throughout his reign. Al-Musta'li's accession sidelined his oldest brother, Nizar, who in response rose in revolt, was defeated and executed. This caused a major split in the Isma'ili movement, with the Nizaris splitting off from the Fatimid-backed Musta'lis. During al-Musta'li's reign, the First Crusade arrived in the Levant, leading to the loss of Jerusalem and a major Fatimid defeat at the Battle of Ascalon.\n\nThe future al-Musta'li was born on 16 September 1074 to the eighth Fatimid caliph, al-Mustansir Billah, and was most likely the youngest of all of al-Mustansir's sons.\n\nAhmad's oldest brother, Nizar ibn al-Mustansir, was apparently considered as the most likely successor to his father, as was the custom; indeed Nizar is often stated to have been the designated (\"naṣṣ\") successor of his father. However, no definite designation of Nizar as heir seems to have taken place by the time of al-Mustansir's death, and the powerful vizier, Badr al-Jamali, and his son and heir al-Afdal Shahanshah, favoured the accession of Ahmad. Shortly before his death, al-Mustansir consented to the wedding of Ahmad with Badr's daughter Sitt al-Mulk. \n\nThe later Musta'li tradition maintains that at the wedding banquet, Ahmad was designated as heir by al-Mustansir, while a medieval source claims that on his deathbed, al-Mustansir had chosen him as heir, and that a sister of al-Mustansir's is said to have been called to him privately and received Ahmad's nomination as a bequest. Modern historians, such as Farhad Daftary, believe that these stories are most likely attempts to justify and retroactively legitimize Ahmad's accession, which they view as a \"de facto\" coup d'etat by al-Afdal. According to this view, al-Afdal chose his brother-in-law because his own position was still insecure, as he had but recently succeeded his father Badr. Ahmad, who was tied to him by virtue of his marriage and completely dependent on him for his accession, would be a compliant figurehead who was unlikely to threaten al-Afdal's as yet fragile hold on power by attempting to appoint another to the vizierate. \n\nAccording to al-Maqrizi, after al-Mustansir died on 29 December 1094, al-Afdal summoned three of al-Mustansir's sons—Nizar, Abdallah, and Isma'il, apparently the most prominent among the caliph's progeny—to the palace to do homage to al-Musta'li, who had been seated on the throne. All three refused, each claiming that he had been designated as successor by their father. This refusal apparently took al-Afdal completely by surprise, and the brothers were even allowed to leave the palace; but while Abdallah and Isma'il made for a nearby mosque, Nizar immediately fled Cairo. To add to the confusion, when learning of al-Mustansir's passing, Baraqat, the chief missionary (\"dāʿı̄\") of Cairo (the head of the Isma'ili religious establishment) proclaimed Abdallah as caliph with the regnal name \"al-Muwaffaq\". Soon, however, al-Afdal regained control: Baraqat was arrested (and later executed), Abdallah and Isma'il were placed under surveillance and eventually acknowledged al-Musta'li, and a grand assembly of officials held, which acclaimed al-Musta'li as imam and caliph.\n\nNizar, in the meantime, fled to Alexandria, where he gained the support of the local governor and populace, and proclaimed himself imam and caliph with the title of \"al-Mustafa li-Din Allah\" (\"the Chosen One for God's Religion\"). Nizar's partisans repulsed al-Afdal's first attempt to seize Alexandria, and Nizar's forces raided up to the outskirts of Cairo. Over the next months, however, al-Afdal managed to win back the allegiance of the Arab tribes with bribes and gifts. Weakened, Nizar's forces were pushed back to Alexandria, which was placed under siege, until Nizar and his remaining followers were forced to surrender. They were taken back to Cairo, where Nizar was immured.\n\nThese events caused a bitter and permanent schism in the Isma'ili movement, that lasts to this day. While al-Musta'li was recognized by the Fatimid establishment and the official Isma'ili \"daʿwa\", as well as the Isma'ili communities dependent on it in Syria and Yemen, most of the Isma'ili communities in the wider Middle East, and especially Persia and Iraq, rejected it. Under the leadership of Hassan-i Sabbah, whether out of conviction or as a convenient excuse, the Isma'ilis in Persia swiftly recognized Nizar's rights to the imamate, severed relations with Cairo, and set up their own independent \"daʿwa\" (the \"daʿwa jadīda\", \"new calling\"). This marked the permanent split of the Isma'ili movement into the rival Musta'li and Nizari branches. At least one Nizar's sons, al-Husayn, fled in 1095 with other members of the dynasty (including three of al-Mustansir's other sons, Muhammad, Isma'il, and Tahir) from Egypt to the Maghreb, where they formed a sort of opposition in exile to the new regime in Cairo. As late as 1162, descendants, or purported descendants, of Nizar appeared to challenge the Fatimid caliphs, and were able to attract considerable followings based on lingering loyalist sentiments of the population.\n\nBy and large, throughout his reign al-Musta'li was subordinate to al-Afdal. Al-Afdal was a capable administrator, and his good governance ensured the continued prosperity of Egypt throughout the reign. Al-Musta'li himself is praised for his upright character by the Sunni contemporary historian Ibn al-Qalanisi, while other medieval historians stress his fanatical devotion to Shi'ism; it appears that the Isma'ili propaganda network (the \"daʿwa\") was very active during his reign. The 15th-century Yemeni Musta'li leader and historian Idris Imad al-Din preserves much information about his dealings with the Isma'ili \"daʿwa\" in Yemen, particularly with the Sulayhid queen Arwa al-Sulayhi and the local \"dāʿı̄\", Yahya ibn Lamak ibn Malik al-Hammadi.\n\nIn foreign affairs, the reign began well, with the voluntary submission of Apamea in northern Syria in 1096, followed by the recovery of Tyre in 1097. However, a proposal for an alliance with the Seljuk ruler of Aleppo, Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan, against Duqaq, the Seljuk ruler of Damascus, failed. \n\nIn the same year, 1097, the First Crusade entered Syria, and al-Afdal sent an embassy to make contact with them. The Fatimids used the distraction of the Crusade to recover control of Jerusalem from its Artuqid rulers in July/August 1098. Al-Afdal did not expect the Crusaders to march south, and was caught by surprise when they moved against Jerusalem in 1099. The city was captured after a siege, and the subsequent defeat of a Fatimid army at the Battle of Ascalon on 5 August 1099 confirmed the new \"status quo\". As a result of the Crusader advance, many Syrians fled to Egypt, where a famine broke out in 1099 or 1100 as a result.\n\nAl-Musta'li died on 12 December 1102, and was succeeded by his son al-Mansur, with the regnal name al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allah.\n\n\n"}

The relationship between regional hegemons and the other states within their spheres of influence is analogous to the relationship between a global hegemon and the other states in the international system.\n\nThe prominent international relations scholar John Mearsheimer writes extensively about the pursuit of regional hegemony in his book, \"The Tragedy of Great Power Politics\". According to his theory, known as offensive realism, the anarchic nature of the international system, the desire for survival, and the uncertainty about other states' intentions ultimately lead states to pursue regional hegemony. According to Mearsheimer, global hegemony is an unattainable goal; instead, a state which has achieved the level of regional hegemon will then work to prevent the development of peer competitors in other regions.\n\nContemporary examples are often politically sensitive or arguable. Often analysis of regional hegemons are based on a specific context or perspective which renders their identification subjective. The United States is a clear example of a regional hegemon in the Americas.\n\nOther regional hegemons include:\n\n\n\n"}

The game was developed for the ZX Spectrum by Ernieware and published by Domark, who also ported the game to the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and Commodore Plus/4.\n\nThe game presents the player with a blank grid to play with. The player controls a flashing cursor which can be moved at will over the canvas. Puzzle pieces are brought into play by pressing the fire button on a dispenser in the top corner of the grid. Pieces can then be slid around the screen. When a piece is moved, it can only be stopped moving by the walls of the play area or by another puzzle piece. A miniature preview of the completed image acts as a guide for the player and also highlights the piece of the puzzle that the player is currently controlling.\n\nThere are a total of ten puzzles in the game. The personalities featured (in order of appearance) are: Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Neil Kinnock, Clive Sinclair, Alan Sugar, Humphrey Bogart, Charles and Diana, Fergie and Andrew, Mick Jagger and Marilyn Monroe. An updated version of the Commodore 64 game was included with Commodore's 'Night Moves/Mindbenders' C64 bundle in 1990, with Reagan, Sinclair and Sugar replaced with Helmut Kohl, Nelson Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev respectively.\n\nIn addition to the puzzle pieces, there are also special tiles which yield bonus points if combined correctly, which include tiles based on the personality of the puzzle, often with political or satirical themes. For example, on the Thatcher level, combining 'Dennis' and gin and tonic will yield bonus points. Other tiles included time bombs which need to either be ejected from the playing field by sliding them towards one of the holes in the sides of the playing area or combined with a water tap tile.\n\nDomark were forced to rename the game following legal proceedings from satirical TV puppet show \"Spitting Image\" who claimed that the original title, \"Splitting Images\", was too close to the name of their show. Domark would later produce an unrelated, officially licensed Spitting Image game.\n"}

The term is used for motor vehicles and trains.\n\nThe weight of a vehicle is influenced by passengers, cargo, even fuel level, so a number of terms are used to express the weight of a vehicle in a designated state. Gross combined weight rating (GCWR) refers to the \"total mass\" of a vehicle, including all trailers. GVWR and GCWR both describe a vehicle that is \"in operation\" and are used to specify weight limitations and restrictions. Curb weight describes a vehicle which is \"parked at the curb\" and excludes the weight of any occupants or cargo. Dry weight further excludes the weight of all consumables, such as fuel and oils. Gross trailer weight rating specifies the maximum weight of a trailer and the gross axle weight rating specifies the maximum weight on any particular axle.\n\nA car driver licence is limited to driving vehicles up to a maximum GVM of . Beyond this, a different class of licence is required. A vehicle with a GVM up to 4,500 kg is termed a \"light\" vehicle, while those over 4,500 kg are termed \"heavy\" vehicles.\n\nMany models of small truck are manufactured to have a GVM rating of but sold with the option of a GVM of just under 4,500 kg so that they can be driven on a car licence. Often, the only difference between the models is where the exhaust exits, with diesel engined heavy rated vehicles having a vertical exhaust \"stack\" above the cabin and the light rated vehicles having the exhaust exit under the side or rear like a car.\n\nMany minor roads, including some in rural areas and some in suburban areas, have GVM restrictions such as 5,000 kg or 8,000 kg. These restrictions may be applied for technical reasons such as load limited bridges, or as a method of reducing the number of heavy vehicles on local roads.\n\nA standard car driving licence issued by an EU country (i.e. class B) limits the licence-holder to driving vehicles with a \"maximum authorised mass\" (i.e. GVWR) of . This includes holders of UK class B driving licences who passed their driving tests on or after 1 January 1997.\n\nA UK driving licence holder who passed his or her class B driving test in or before 1996 is limited to driving vehicles with a GVWR of or less, including minibuses not used for hire or reward.\n\nAnyone looking to drive a heavy goods vehicle (i.e. any vehicle other than those used for passenger transport) with a GVWR of over must obtain a class C licence. Anyone looking to drive any vehicle with a GVWR of up to must obtain a class C1 licence. Anyone with a class C licence can drive class C1 vehicles.\n\nIn the United States, two important GVWR limitations are . Vehicles over 6,000 lb are restricted from some city roadways (though there is some dispute about whether this restriction is for actual curb weight or GVWR). Commercial vehicles over the 8,500 lb threshold are required to have insurance under Section 387.303 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.\n\nVehicles or combinations with a GVWR over generally require a Commercial Driver License (CDL) or a Non-Commercial Class \"A\" or \"B\" license. A CDL is also required for certain vehicles under 26,000 lb GVWR, such as buses and for-hire passenger vehicles of 16 or more passengers, all vehicles transporting placarded hazardous materials or wastes regardless of weight or load class, and any vehicle towing a trailer with a Gross Trailer Weight over where the combination weight is greater than 26,000lbs.\n\nOn vehicles designed for the North American market, the GVWR can be found alongside other vehicle technical specifications on the Vehicle ID Plate that is usually located on the interior of the B-pillar according to U.S. or Canadian Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). (inside driver door near door latch).\n\nMost U.S. and Australian commercial trucks are required by licensing authorities to have this information printed on the outside of the vehicle, and for it to be clearly visible from a specified distance.\n\n"}

Built in 1933 as part of the newly constructed \"Chertsey Arterial Road\", the bridge connects the Old Deer Park district of Richmond (historically Surrey) on the south bank of the river to St. Margarets (historically Middlesex) on the north bank, both within the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. Twickenham Bridge gets its name from the fact that it is on the road to the town of Twickenham (also in the same London borough), which is approximately 3 km upstream from Twickenham Bridge, past Richmond Bridge.\n\nThe bridge forms part of today's A316 (Chertsey Road), which links Central and West London with the M3 motorway at Sunbury-on-Thames.\n\nThe bridge's architect was Maxwell Ayrton and the head engineer was Alfred Dryland. The proposed design of the bridge envisaged four 70 foot towers to be constructed on the riverbanks with retaining walls of 20 feet above road level. The plans were widely opposed and a local petition was organised by the Daily Telegraph against the design on the grounds that it was inappropriate to the setting in Richmond.\n\nThe final design of the bridge was of three reinforced-concrete arches supported on concrete piers \nwith Art Deco embellishments. The bridge incorporates three permanent hinges enabling the structure to adjust to changes in temperature, the first reinforced concrete bridge structure in the UK to use such an innovation. The arch springings, as well as the arch crowns, have decorative bronze cover plates. Ribbed shuttering was used in the casting of the concrete piers and abutments, giving the main faces a ribbed finish that was then knocked back. The approach viaduct and retaining walls were constructed in precast blocks that were wire brushed to create a rough finish. The balustrades and lamps were constructed of open bronzework. The Bromsgrove Guild was employed in casting and fitting the bronze lamp standards and parapets as well as the railings on the four staircases between road level and the river bank \n\nThe bridge was opened on 3 July 1933 by Edward, Prince of Wales.\n\nIn 1992, the first Gatso speed camera in the United Kingdom was launched on Twickenham Bridge.\n\nThe bridge was declared a Grade II* listed structure in 2008, providing protection to preserve its special character from unsympathetic development.\n\n\n"}

In 1993, his debut solo album \"The Outback Club\" won an ARIA award for Best Country Album and his hit single \"Boys from the Bush\" topped the Australian country music charts.\n\nKernaghan has dominated the charts with successive hit albums, including \"Outback Club\", \"Three Chain Road\", \"1959\", \"Hat Town\", \"Electric Rodeo\", \"The New Bush\", \"Planet Country\", \"Beautiful Noise\" and \"Spirit of the Anzacs\". Kernaghan has made a huge impact on country music in Australia, creating a new musical landscape for the genre when he burst onto the scene.\n\nTo many people, Kernaghan represents the spirit and values of contemporary rural Australia. His love of the Australian way of life features in his music, and he is a passionate supporter of Australia's rural culture.\n\nDuring a visit to the Australian War Memorial in 2013, Kernaghan's friend and AWM Director Dr. Brendan Nelson introduced Kernaghan to letters that were written by Australian service men and women during various wars dating back to the landing at Gallipoli during the First World War. These letters were held in the vaults at the AWM.\n\nThe power of the letters affected him deeply and the experience at the Australian War Memorial that day was the catalyst that saw these letters put to music in what would become his most recent album, \"Spirit of the Anzacs\".\n\nUpon release, \"Spirit of the Anzacs\" went platinum within 3 weeks, and dominated the ARIA album chart by holding the #1 position for four weeks and then the #2 position for another three weeks, making it the highest selling Australian album for 2015.\n\n2015 also saw the release of Kernaghan's first book, \"The Boy from the Bush, These Are My Songs, These Are My Stories\".\n\nKernaghan closed out 2015 with a national tour called The Songs and the Stories in Concert. Fittingly, the tour covered elements of the book and also featured songs from \"Spirit of the Anzacs\".\n\nIn 2019 Kernaghan released the album \"Backroad Nation\" with the title track staying four weeks at #1 on the country singles charts.\n\nHe is the father of two sons.\n\nKernaghan has won four ARIA Awards and three APRA Awards, and has been nominated in award categories numerous times.\n\nAs of 2015, Kernaghan has had 33 #1 hits on the Australian country charts, and has sold over two million albums.\n\nHe was named \"Hit Maker of the Decade\" twice, in 2001 and 2011. This title goes to country artists from anywhere in the world who achieves the most hits in the Australian market over the past decade.\n\nHe has sold over two million albums, and won 36 Golden Guitars at the Country Music Awards of Australia (second to Slim Dusty).\n\nKernaghan was the recipient of the Outstanding Achievement Award at the 2015 ARIA Awards, for \"Spirit of the Anzacs\".\n\nKernaghan received the Order of Australia Medal in 2004.\n\nIn 2008, he was Australian of the Year, in recognition for his support of rural and regional Australia; his 'Pass the Hat Around' tours have raised more than a million dollars for rural communities during a challenging period of drought. He was presented with the award by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.\n\nIn 2015, Kernaghan was inducted into the Australian Roll of Renown.\n\nDuring July 2015, Kernaghan's music was played at anti-Islam rallies in Australia, without his permission. He responded that the use of his work should be \"consistent with – and respectful of, the memory of ... [soldiers who] laid down their lives for the freedoms we have today.\" Fellow local artists, Jimmy Barnes, John Farnham and Mark Seymour, objected to the use of their material at those rallies.\n\n\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music. Kernaghan has won two awards from 14 nominations. Plus, he received the Outstanding Achievement Award in 2015.\nThe APRA Awards are held in Australia and New Zealand by the Australasian Performing Right Association to recognise songwriting skills, sales and airplay performance by its members annually. Kernaghan has won four awards from nine nominations.\nKernaghan has won thirty-seven Golden Guitar awards at the Tamworth Country Music Awards of Australia.\nThe Music For A New Generation Awards are run by the Planet Country with Big Stu & MJ radio program and celebrate crossover country artist efforts each year. The awards have featured fan voting since 2016.\nFor several years, Kernaghan owned the historic Great Western Hotel in Rockhampton, Queensland, after buying the pub in 2003 when it was placed into receivership after a downturn in trade and public liability concerns. Kernaghan has described the time during which he owned the Great Western Hotel as one of the greatest periods of his life.\n\n"}

The bas-relief \"Cleobis and Biton\", with which he gained the second prize of the Academy in 1803, at once established his fame as a sculptor and gained for him a number of influential patrons. His bas-relief of the \"Battle of Austerlitz\" was among those executed for the column erected in Place Vendôme. He also executed many minor pieces for Vivant Denon, besides portrait busts of the opera composers Méhul and Cherubini. \n\nHis great patron, however, was Napoleon, for whom he executed a colossal bust, and who sent him, on the recommendations of his sister Elisa Baciocchi, to Accademia Carrara in Bergamo in 1807, to teach sculpture, in spite of local opposition. Here he remained as the quasi-official portrait sculptor to the Buonapartes till after the fall of Napoleon. In 1833, Bartolini was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Honorary member.\nHe then took up his residence in Florence, where he resided until his death.\nHe is buried in the Church of Santa Croce in north-east Florence. \n\nIn Florence, his Bonapartist associations and his departures as an artist from the strict Canovan classicism being taught at the Academy\" limited his opportunities. His naturalistic and somewhat sentimental marble \"L'Ammostatore\" (\"The Bird's-nest Stealer\", 1820) took its inspiration from under-appreciated Quattrocento Florentine sculptors like Andrea Verrocchio. In his decade of impoverishment, supportive commissions came from foreigners; the funeral monument to Princess Sofia Zamoyski Czartoriski (died 1837) in Santa Croce, Florence's Westminster Abbey, is an anti-classical statement for naturalism. Two other Bartolini monuments in Santa Croce can be compared with it; in the Capella Giugni is his monument to Carlotta Buonaparte (died 1839), but when the occasion required a more formal approach, as in the monument to Leone Battista Alberti, the result could be chilly. \n\nA major commission came in 1830 from the sons of the Russian emigree prince Nicola Demidoff, who had retired to Florence. The sons commissioned the Monument to Nicola Demidoff to honor their father, which was placed in Piazza Demidoff, Florence. The commission's multiple figures took shape during Bartolini's last decades; it was completed by Bartolini's assistant Pasquale Romanelli.\n\nHis works are varied and include an immense number of portrait busts. The best are, perhaps, the group of \"Charity\" (1824), the \"Hercules and Lichas\" and \"Faith in God\", commissioned by the widow of Giuseppe Poldi Pezzoli. His portrait statue of \"Machiavelli\" took its place as his only commission among the long series of historical Florentine males provided for the empty exterior niches of the Uffizi. \n\n\n\n"}

Sanpellegrino S.p.A. has been part of Swiss company Nestlé since 1997 and its products are exported to most countries in Europe, the Americas, Australasia and the Middle East, as well as in Asia in Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong.\n\nThe Sanpellegrino Company has ten production sites in Italy including its headquarters. More than 1,850 people work in the company. It also manages other brands like Vera, Levissima and Acqua Panna, and its revenue, according to the balance sheet of the year 2016, amounts to 895 million euros, about 96 million euros less than the previous year. 50,000 bottles of water are produced every hour in the San Pellegrino plant, for a total amount of one million bottles a day including soft drinks, sparkling water and cocktails. The bottles are then sorted to be exported to major countries around the world.\n\nIn 2005, five hundred million bottles were sold globally. In 2017, that number had increased to one billion bottles.\n\n\nS.Pellegrino mineral water is produced in San Pellegrino Terme. The water may originate from a layer of rock below the surface, where it is mineralized from contact with limestone and volcanic rocks. The springs are located at the foot of a dolomite mountain wall which favours the formation and replenishment of a mineral water basin. The water then seeps to depths of over and flows underground to a distant aquifer.\n\nThe water from the spring is not naturally carbonated; rather, gas is added prior to packaging.\n\nS.Pellegrino mineral water has been produced for over 620 years. In 1395, the town borders of San Pellegrino were drawn, marking the start of its water industry. Leonardo da Vinci is said to have visited the town in 1509 to sample and examine the town's miraculous water, later writing a treatise on water. Analysis shows that the water is strikingly similar to the samples taken in 1782, the first year such analysis took place. In fact, doctors from Northern Italy in the 13th Century used to suggest that their patients go to the Val Brembana spring for treatment. Over the years, its therapeutic properties attracted many visitors, and, at the beginning of 1900, San Pellegrino Terme became a holiday resort with a casino, thermal baths and a hotel. In 1794 a treatise mentioned S.Pellegrino water as a treatment method for kidney stone disease.\nIn 1839, S.Pellegrino water was recommended for people affected with kidney diseases and urinary tract infection.\n\nIn 1760, Pellegrino Foppoli built a bathhouse where visitors had to pay a fee to use the indoor facilities.\nIn 1803, Foppoli's descendants sold the bathhouse to Giovanni Pesenti who wanted to construct a larger building.\nThe town council feared that this project would prevent visitors from free use of the spring. For this reason, they filed a complaint with the prefect which led Ester Pesenti and Lorenzo Palazzolo to sign an agreement in 1831. They decided that the 24 unit spring would be divided into two. So that, 17 units were given to Pesenti and Palazzolo and 7 units to San Pellegrino Terme town council.\nIn 1834, the flood of the Brembo, the river that crosses San Pellegrino Terme, caused serious damage in the valley.\nSince the restoration required huge expenses, in 1837 the town leased Pesenti and Palazzolo its share of the water for 12 years. In 1841, Ester Pesenti requested an authorization to continue to expand the bathhouse.\n\nOne year later, another flood hit the valley and San Pellegrino Terme sold three-quarters of its shares to Pesenti. Since the water had always been connected to the territory, they agreed to give the remaining quarter of the shares to the residents of the town who still can use an external tap free of charge. The construction work finished in 1846.\n\nWhen Queen Margherita visited the town in 1905, many articles appeared on the Giornale di San Pellegrino, in which it was illustrated that the bottled mineral water was sold in the main Italian cities, in many cities around Europe, as well as in Cairo, Tangiers, Shanghai, Calcutta, Sydney, Brazil, Peru, and the United States. One case of 50 bottles cost 26 Italian lire, while a case of 24 bottles cost 14 Italian lire. At the beginning of the 20th century, carbon dioxide was added to S.Pellegrino to prevent the development of bacteria, especially during long overseas travels. It is still taken from sources in Tuscany and sent to San Pellegrino Terme. The spa facilities were renovated, and in 1928, they were equipped with more modern tools for various diagnostic needs, such as the radioscopic and radiograph room and the microscopic and chemical analysis laboratory. In addition, Granelli reorganized the bottling plant with new equipment, which moved up to a production capacity of 120,000 bottles a day.\n\nAt the beginning, it was a handmade production, then it became gradually mechanized and was managed by an all female staff. The first machinery was introduced in 1930 and, since that moment, the amount produced has been increasing. Subsequently, the company began a packaging process for shipping to the recipient countries.\nIn 1961, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. started to produce bottled mineral water and other beverages in the new San Pellegrino Terme factory.\nIn 1932, the \"Aranciata\" orangeade variant was introduced. Containing S.Pellegrino as its primary ingredient, the soda added concentrated orange juice. Today, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. also produces various other flavors of carbonated beverages: \"Limonata\" (lemonade), \"Sanbittèr\" (bitters), \"Pompelmo\" (grapefruit), \"Aranciata Rossa\" (blood orange), and \"Chinò\" (chinotto).\n\nIn 1968, S.Pellegrino appeared on the front cover of the British Sunday newspaper \"The Observer\".\nDuring the Italian Occupation of Ethiopia production was curtailed in its entirety for the Italian military water needs. During this time they advocated for the policy changes Mussolini's government had been implementing. This increased revenue dramatically for several years, even after the occupation had faltered.\nOver the years, the bottling lines increased the production levels needed to satisfy the needs of a market which was becoming more and more sophisticated, and in 2012 a high speed PET bottling line was installed.\n\nThe company built a new plant some kilometers beyond the previous one as the water production continued to grow.\n\nOn April 20, 1970 the water company changed its name from Società Anonima Delle Terme di S.Pellegrino to Sanpellegrino S.p.A.\nIn the early seventies, it was decided to no longer use mineral water in the production of soft drinks, and to substitute it with spring water which was treated with particular equipment.\n\nIn 1997, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. was bought by Perrier Vittel SA, a division of Nestlé which also owned the Perrier and Vittel bottled water brands. In Italy, S.Pellegrino is available in 1.5 L bottles for about one euro, the same for their Aranciata in most stores. Competitive orange drinks can cost even less. If artificial sweeteners are used, the price is about half that of the sugared varieties.\n\nPaolo Luni, who joined the company as a consultant, then became General Manager and eventually CEO, left the company in 1999 after having inaugurated the Sanpellegrino Centennial celebrations, which took place in Teatro La Scala in Milan. The company now became the complete property of Nestlé Group.\n\nIn May 2014, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. released two new flavors of their Sparkling Fruit Beverages. The new flavors were Melograno e Arancia (Pomegranate and Orange) and Clementina (Clementine). They were announced through an installation at Eataly's La Scuola Grande in New York where large cans of the new soda flavors were constructed out of flowers.\n\nThe bottles' packaging has maintained the original references to its territory and its first productions. The products on the market can be divided into two categories: glass and PET.\n\nThe shape of the glass bottles has remained the same since its origin in 1899. The model is called Vichy because at that time San Pellegrino Terme was known as \"the Italian Vichy\", and it is characterized by the elongated shape of the bottle. The red star was a symbol of high quality products exported from Italy between the 1800s and the 1900s. On the neck of the bottle there is a representation of the Casino, above the date of foundation of the brand and the company. The label has a white and blue watermark, which recalls the Belle Epoque style.\n\nThe PET line has the same shape of the glass bottles. The production started at the end of the 1990s with the aim of maintaining the same perlage and effervescence of the glass line. At the beginning, only the 50 centiliters size was produced, but since 2006, the production of the 33, 75 and 100 centilitre bottles were added to the original one.\n\nDifferent versions of the label were created for collaborations, partnerships and international events. \nIn 2010, 2011 and 2013 the project \"S.Pellegrino Meets Italian Talents\" was meant to create collaborations with Italians known on an international level as a symbol of Italy. These collaborations include Missoni, Bulgari and a tribute to Luciano Pavarotti.\n\n\nS.Pellegrino can be seen for the first time in 1949 in the movie \"The Emperor of Capri\", directed by Luigi Comencini and since that moment it has appeared in the following movies and TV series.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, the German consumer television program \"Markt\" reported that S.Pellegrino contains uranium. Nestlé was informed about this and responded that uranium was common in both bottled and tap water and that the 0.0070mg/l found in their product was below the 0.03 mg/l threshold established by various governments and food health organizations.\n\nS.Pellegrino is not suitable for infants under 12 weeks of age, because their gastrointestinal tract and urinary system is immature and cannot withstand highly mineralized water.\n\n"}

The film was directed by J. Lee Thompson. The story line of the film is considerably different from that of Gogol's novel, although it is closer to his expanded 1842 (pro-Russian Imperial) edition than his original (pro-Ukrainian) version of 1835.\n\nThe film opens in the 16th century, when Russia, Poland and Eastern Europe were divided into small sections and principalities that fought each other or against one enemy: in this case, the Ottoman Empire. It starts with a battle raging between the Turks and the Poles. The Poles are losing until the Cossacks arrive to save the day. However, it turns out that the Poles were merely holding back so that they could treacherously attack the Cossacks after they won the battle for them. As a result, the Poles become masters of Ukraine and the Cossacks are subjugated. Taras Bulba, one of the Cossack officers, returns home to raise his family but now it is under Polish dominion.\n\nSeveral years later, Taras sends his two sons, Andriy (Tony Curtis) and Ostap (Perry Lopez) to the academy at Kiev, to obtain a Polish education. There, the eldest son, Andriy, falls in love with a Polish princess Natalia Dubrov (played by Christine Kaufmann), to the ire of the locals, who treat the Cossack brothers like scum of the earth. Ultimately, the brothers are forced to flee Kiev, returning to their father’s house on the Ukrainian steppes.\n\nThere, word comes that the Poles want the Cossacks to raise an army to help them in a new war in the Baltic region. When Andriy objects, he is accused of being a coward. This is a serious offense that can only be resolved by a test of courage. Andriy and his accuser ride and jump their horses over a chasm until God chooses which one is right by having the accuser fall to his death. Taras embraces Andriy’s lead and plans to betray the Poles and take back the Ukraine.\n\nAssuming command of the Cossacks, Taras leads them to Dubno, where the Poles are expecting him to join them. Instead, the Cossacks attack the Polish army and drive it back into the city. The Cossacks then lay siege to the city. Hunger and disease set in and Andriy, fearing for the life of his Polish lover, sneaks into the city in an attempt to rescue her. He is captured and she is condemned to be burned at the stake for the crime of loving a Cossack. To save her, Andriy agrees to lead a raiding party to bring cattle into the starving city.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cossacks have grown bored with the inactivity of the siege and a large number of them have departed for home. When the Polish commander realizes the weakness of the Cossacks against the raiding force, he orders his whole army to attack. Taras Bulba encounters his son on the field of battle and kills him for his betrayal before joining the general retreat to the edge of a cliff. There, the Cossacks who left the siege to go home, rejoin the battle and large numbers of men and horses, both Cossack and Polish, are pushed over the edge to their deaths in the river below.\n\nThe movie ends with the Cossacks victorious and entering Dubno. Andriy is to be buried there, as “... it is now a Cossack city.” By the words of Hetman Taras Bulba, the Cossacks will not treat the Poles as badly as they were treated by them: \"We will not ravage. We will not pillage. We will burn out the plague, and open the supply wagons, and feed the people of \"our\" city.\"\n\n\nThe score was composed by Franz Waxman, and film composer Bernard Hermann considered it one of the best scores ever written. It is now available on a CD from the City of Prague Philharmonic. The score also serves as the theme tune to morning news programs \"Melo Del Prado sa Super Radyo DZBB\", \"Buena Manong Balita\", \"Super Radyo Nationwide\" & \"Saksi sa Dobol B\", aired on the radio station DZBB in the Philippines.\n\nAt the 35th Academy Awards, the score was also nominated for Best Music, Score - Substantially Original but lost to Lawrence of Arabia (Maurice Jarre).\n\nConcurrent with the release of the film, Gold Medal Books, an imprint of Fawcett Publications, issued a tie-in screenplay novelization by Robert W. Krepps. An author who had established himself with brilliant adventure novels set in Africa, Krepps was also one of the great novelizers of the era, and his adaptation is typically stylish and compelling.\n\nOn 25 March 2008 the film was released on DVD in Regions 1 and 2. This is its first release on DVD. On 23 September 2014 a Blu-ray version was released by Kino Video in the United States.\n\nThe film was budgeted at $3.8 million but went $2.2 million over, and ended up causing United Artists to lose $4.5 million.\n\nAlthough the story is set in the Eastern European steppes, the film was actually shot in California, United States and Salta, Argentina.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n\n"}

However, the Tube Lines' logo remain widely visible on staff uniforms and vehicle liveries. Tube Lines' headquarters were at 15 Westferry Circus, London.\n\nTube Lines was established under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) scheme in 2003 to provide maintenance services to the London Underground, together with another company, Metronet. Metronet entered administration in 2008 and was bought by TfL. Tube Lines was also bought by TfL in 2010 following a funding shortfall.\n\nThe company was founded by a consortium of Amey plc (a subsidiary of Grupo Ferrovial), Bechtel and Jarvis plc. In 2005, Jarvis sold its stake to fellow shareholder Amey for £147 million.\n\nFrom January 2003 until May 2011 the London Underground operated a Public-Private Partnership (PPP), whereby the infrastructure assets were maintained by private companies but it was owned and operated by London Underground (LU), part of TfL.

There had been many discussions over the future of the company in the second review period, and it was announced on 7 May 2010 that Transport for London had agreed to buy the shares of Bechtel and Amey (Ferrovial) from Tube Lines for £310 million. Combined with the takeover of Metronet, this meant that all maintenance was thereafter managed in-house, despite TfL using a large number of private suppliers and contractors.\n\nAmey continued to provide TfL with management and maintenance services for the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines until the end of 2017 when London Underground Limited took over from Amey.\n"}

The school was renamed in 1908, taking its current denomination. In 1931, the school was placed under the control of the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), and in 1953 women were given the right to study in the institution.\n\nAs the school is under the UBA control, the high school diplomas are issued by the University of Buenos Aires itself. Most, if not all of the teaching staff also teaches at the UBA, and Physical Education classes take place at the UBA's Ciudad Universitaria (\"campus\"). This relationship between the school and the University also gives graduated students the possibility of attending an extra 6th year for a degree in \"Ciencias Comerciales\" (\"Bachelor in Commercial Science\"); the subjects for this academic year are equivalent to the UBA's Ciclo Básico Común (CBC - \"Common Basic Cycle\"; a year of basic subjects study, mainly aimed to level students from different high school backgrounds) plus four other assignments. This extra curricular year entitles the students to enter the UBA in many majors, specially including economy-related ones, without the need of attending the CBC.\nIn the year 2005, several changes were made in what concerns to the CBC. Students can now make the entry course to any university, and not only to the economy-oriented ones.\n\nThe number of applicants in 2008 for the 2009 school year has dropped to 550, about half of the number of students who applied in 2007, and previous years. Many of the students who did not apply to Carlos Pellegrini, chose similar institutions elsewhere, such as the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires, or the Instituto Libre de Segunda Enseñanza\n\nThe main building was designed by Italian architect Gino Aloisi (1864 – 1924), and inaugurated in 1909.\n\nThe Carlos Pellegrini High School of Commerce is located on 1851 Marcelo T. de Alvear Street, between Riobamba St. and Callao Avenue (Avenida Callao), in the neighbourhood of Recoleta. The phone number is (+54 11) 4815-4001/5. Several bus routes serve the school and its vicinity: 12, 29, 37, 39, 60, 99, 101, 106, 108, 109, 111, 124, 132, 140, 150 and 152, as well as Line D and Line B of the Buenos Aires Metro (Subte).\n\nThe school's admission process is highly competitive. Every year, about 1500 students apply, all of which are attending the 7th year (Grade 7) of their Primary School. These students are subject to 12 exams divided into four major areas: Mathematics, History, Geography and Spanish. They are required to take three tests of each one of the subjects mentioned above. Entry to the school is quite limited, as around 450 of the applicants finally achieve their goal. Two tests are given in a same day, and students can leave school earlier than during normal class days. The first 6 exams are three from Spanish and three from History. Then, after the winter holidays (2 weeks) they start with the Maths and Geography classes. The distribution of the tests is the same as the first part of the year.\n\nThe school is one of the most politically active high schools in Argentina, with a high percentage of militant students who organise themselves in the \"Centro de Estudiantes del Carlos Pellegrini\" (Carlos Pellegrini Student's Center). The Student Center, usually referred to as \"CECaP\", holds annual elections and, until the year 2005, was subdivided in different areas, such as Sports, Charity Action, Press and Culture; since 2006, though, it's divided in \"Comisiones\" (\"commissions\") created by the students, under the supervision of the \"Comisión de delegados\" (\"Delegates commission\") This system is more democratic than the old system, since the commissions now are created by and their membership determined by students, whereas previously they were managed by the political parties. The CECaP is well known for its left-wing character.\n\n\n\n"}

It is owned by Exo, the organization that operates public transport services across this region.\n\nThe line was created in 1918 as a Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) service. Canadian National Railway (CN) ran the line starting in 1923 following the merger of CNoR into CN. CN transferred the Deux-Montagnes Line to the Société de transport de la communauté urbaine de Montréal (STCUM) on July 1, 1982. The line was refurbished from 1992 to 1995. It was transferred to the RTM's predecessor agency, the Agence Métropolitaine de transport (AMT) on January 1, 1996. The RTM assumed current operation of the line upon its establishment on June 1, 2017.\n\nOn May 11, 2020, service between and Montreal Central Station was closed due to the construction of Réseau express métropolitain (REM). In the early 2020s, the Deux-Montagnes line will close permanently in favour of REM service which will operate along the same route.\n\nThis line links Central Station in downtown Montreal with Deux-Montagnes to the northwest of the Island of Montreal.\n\nThe line offers frequent service during rush hours (10–30 minute intervals) and hourly service outside rush hours on weekdays. Since April 27, 2018, weekend service on the line had been shut down. Prior, there was hourly service on weekends.\n\nThe trains are owned and managed by the RTM and are operated by Bombardier Transportation.\n\nDeux-Montagnes, Roxboro-Pierrefonds, and Central Station are wheelchair-accessible.\n\nIn 2016 an average of 30,700 people rode this train daily, having almost as many passengers as Montreal's four other commuter railway lines combined. There are 25 inbound and 24 outbound departures each weekday.\n\nOn April 22, 2016, it was announced that the Deux-Montagnes line would be converted from commuter rail to automated light metro in 2020, as part of the Réseau express métropolitain network.\n\nThe Deux-Montagnes line was built by the Canadian Northern Railway. While other railways including Canadian Pacific and Grand Trunk Railway already had prime downtown locations for their terminal stations, Canadian Northern did not, having only a station out of the way on Moreau Street in Hochelaga.\n\nIn 1910, it was decided that the best way for Canadian Northern to get downtown was to drill their way downtown — through Mont Royal. The construction started at both ends and met halfway through with only an inch difference. In 1918 the electrified (2400 V DC catenary), double-track tunnel was dubbed Montreal's first subway. Because the tunnel is on a steep grade and inadequately ventilated it was decided from the very beginning that the locomotives would be electric. The ventilation shaft is located SW of the intersection of Édouard-Montpetit Boulevard and Vincent-d'Indy Avenue very close to the Édouard-Montpetit Metro Station.\n\nThe structure gauge of the Mount Royal Tunnel limits the height of bilevel cars to .\n\nIn order to finance the project, Canadian Northern built a ‘model city’ north of the tunnel, modeled after Washington, D.C. The Town of Mount-Royal has grown to be an upper-income neighbourhood today. Construction began in 1912 and finished in 1918. The first train was pulled by electric locomotive #601 (retired as #6711), which left Tunnel Terminal at 8:30 a.m. on October 21, 1918. The Canadian Northern Railway went bankrupt and was absorbed into what is now Canadian National. Tunnel Terminal was replaced by Central Station in 1943. CN added electric multiple units from Canadian Car and Foundry in 1952.\n\nIn the 1960s, the first plans were announced to renovate the line, whose equipment was 40 years old at the time. First, it was to become metro line 3 (red), but plans were shelved because of the importance to build line 4 for service to Expo 67. With the equipment ageing, and ridership declining, CN wanted to close the line in the 1970s, but their proposals were rejected. The Quebec Ministry of Transport considered using the line for a high-speed connection to Mirabel Airport (Transport rapide régional aéroportuaire Montréal Mirabel, 1974) or as the first line of a BART-style regional metro system (Réseau express de Montréal, 1977; Métro régional, 1979). None of these projects progressed beyond the planning stage.\n\nIn 1982, management of commuter trains was transferred to the publicly owned Montreal Urban Community Transit Commission (STCUM). The STCUM set fares and schedules, while the Canadian National retained ownership of the equipment (passenger cars and locomotives). CN continued to provide the tracks, stations, storage, maintenance, and train crews needed to keep the line running. For Montreal commuters, the transfer of ownership was positive because the trains were integrated into the bus and metro system.\n\nIn 1992, the government of Quebec announced a modernisation plan for the line which would include electrifying the entire line at 25 kV AC (and converting the existing catenary in the Mont-Royal Tunnel to this voltage), 58 state-of-the-art MR-90 electric multiple unit trains built by Bombardier Transportation, new tracks, and centralised traffic control. Service was shut down completely in the summers of 1993, 1994 and 1995 to allow for major work to be done. The last of the old rolling stock left Central Station at 6:30 p.m. on June 2, 1995 – 76 years, 8 months, 11 days, and ten hours after it first went into service. The same locomotive, #6711 (with #6710 (pictured)), hauled the last train through the tunnel.\n\nThe line was transferred to the former Agence métropolitaine de transport (AMT) on January 1, 1996.\n\nOn June 1, 2017, the AMT was dissolved and replaced by two new governing bodies, the Autorité régionale de transport métropolitain (ARTM) and the Réseau de transport métropolitain (RTM). The RTM took over all former AMT services, including this line.\n\nIn May 2018, the RTM formally re-branded itself as EXO; and renamed each line with a number and updated colour. The Deux-Montagnes line became Exo 6, and the blue line colour was updated to a light peach colour.\n\nTo ease overcrowding and attract new users on the Deux-Montagnes Line, the ARTM is carrying out several projects:\n\n\nUnder the Réseau express métropolitain project, the Deux-Montagnes line is being converted to driverless light metro operation and extended past Downtown and over the St-Lawrence to Brossard; two southwest branches will also be added, to Montreal-Pierre Eliott Trudeau International Airport and to Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue.\n\n\nAs of May 2020, only the stations between and are in operation. The following stations are on the Deux-Montagnes line:\n\nAs of January 9, 2012 many bus line number have changed.\n\nThe Deux-Montagnes line uses the former CN Deux-Montagnes Subdivision between mile 0.8 (Central Station) and 19.4 (Deux-Montagnes). The RTM now owns it.\n\nThe line runs through the Mount Royal Tunnel, to connect downtown Montreal, to the north side rail subdivision.\n\nOn the line lay the Val Royal Bridge rail viaduct, once the world's largest concrete span, next to Val Royal Station (now Bois-Franc station)\n\n"}

It is operated by Exo, the organization that operates public transport services across this region.\n\nThe Vaudreuil–Hudson line was originally established in 1887 as a Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) passenger service known as the CP Lakeshore West line. It was transferred to Société de transport de Montréal (STCUM) on October 1, 1982. It was refurbished between 1982 and 1990. On January 1, 1996, it was transferred to Exo's predecessor agency, the Agence Métropolitaine de transport (AMT). Exo assumed current operation of the line upon its establishment on June 1, 2017.\n\nThere are 13 inbound and 14 outbound departures each weekday.\n\nThis line links the Lucien-L'Allier station in downtown Montreal with Hudson to the west of the Island of Montreal. With the completion of the Intermodal station in Vaudreuil, most trains that used to terminate in Dorion, now terminate in Vaudreuil.\n\nThe line offers frequent peak-hour service (roughly every 15-20 minutes) to or from Vaudreuil. Outside of rush hours, service is approximately every two to three hours. On weekends, service is approximately every five hours. There is only one weekday round trip from the Hudson terminus. This is the only line in Montreal to offer semi-express service; reverse peak trains do not stop at certain smaller stations.\n\nThe trains are owned and managed by the Réseau de transport métropolitain, and operated by Bombardier Transportation.\n\nService on this line started in 1887. Service began with local stops between Montreal and Rigaud being added to trains running between Montreal and Ottawa. Over time, as the population of the western part of the Island of Montreal increased, Canadian Pacific established a dedicated commuter service with several stops on the Island of Montreal and off the western tip of the Island. Over the past 50 years, service patterns on the line have not changed all that much. The average number of weekday round trips has hovered around 12, with weekend and holiday service averaging 3 or 4 trips depending on whether the day is Saturday or Sunday.\n\nThe commuter line was owned and operated by Canadian Pacific until October 1, 1982. On that date, management and ownership of the commuter trains was transferred to the publicly owned Montreal Urban Community Transit Commission (STCUM). The STCUM set fares and schedules, and assumed ownership of the equipment (passenger cars and locomotives) that Canadian Pacific had used to operate the service. Canadian Pacific continued to provide the tracks, stations, storage, maintenance, and train crews needed to keep the line running. For Montreal commuters, the transfer of ownership was positive because the trains were integrated into the bus and metro system. Over time, the commuter line was upgraded with the purchase of new equipment and renovated stations. The line was transferred to the newly formed Agence métropolitaine de transport (AMT) on January 1, 1996.\n\nOn July 1, 2010, service to Rigaud was discontinued, as the town of Rigaud was unable to justify a $300,000 annual fee, almost double the previous annual fee of $160,000 required by the AMT to maintain train service for a handful of users. The line now ends at Hudson; the 13-km distance between Rigaud and Hudson represented some 17% of the line's total length. At this time the line was renamed: \"Dorion\" was replaced by \"Vaudreuil\" in reference to the terminus for most runs, and \"Rigaud\" was replaced by \"Hudson\" in reference to the terminus for the extended service.\n\nOn June 1st, 2017, the AMT was dissolved and replaced by two new governing bodies, the Autorité régionale de transport métropolitain (ARTM) and the Réseau de transport métropolitain (RTM). The RTM took over all former AMT services, including this line.\n\nIn May 2018, the RTM formally re-branded itself as Exo; and renamed each line with a number and updated colour.

It is operated by Exo, the organization that operates public transport services across this region.\n\nThe Saint-Jérôme line was operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) between 1882 and 1981. The line was not active until Exo's predecessor agency, the Agence Métropolitaine de transport (AMT), resumed passenger service in 1997.\n\nThere are 15 inbound and 15 outbound departures each weekday. There are six departures on Saturday and Sunday, although these trains terminate at De La Concorde station with connection to De La Concorde Metro station, instead of continuing to Parc or Lucien-L'Allier Station.\n\nThis line links the Lucien-L'Allier station in Downtown Montreal with Saint-Jérôme, on Montreal's North Shore. More than 2000 Park and Ride spaces are available for commuters.\n\nThe line offers service on weekdays with limited service to and from de la Concorde Metro on weekends. The frequency of service is 25–45 minutes during rush hour and every one to two hours outside of rush hour, of which five trips continue to or begin at Lucien-L'Allier station. All other trips begin or end at Parc Metro station.\n\nToday, more than 14,000 people ride the line daily.\n\nThe line between Montreal and Saint-Jérôme was built in 1876 by the Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Occidental Railway (QMOO), which was owned by the Government of Quebec. In 1881, it was sold to Canadian Pacific along with the line on the north shore of the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers, between Quebec City and Ottawa. CP operated Le petit train du nord, the Ottawa train via Lachute, the Quebec train via Trois-Rivières as well as the Sainte-Thérèse RDC train along this route between 1882 and 1979.\n\nThe Montreal–Blainville line was originally opened in July 1997 and was supposed to serve commuters during the construction on the Marius Dufresne Bridge. In its early stages of life, the AMT Blainville train was composed of a GP9 locomotive and four Canadian Vickers Gallery Coaches. Although it offered only three departures per day (two peak, one reverse peak), it instantly became very successful. In 1997, there were only four stations: Blainville, Sainte-Thérèse, Saint-Martin, and Jean-Talon (now Parc). The stations were merely wooden platforms with gravel parking lots; not too much money was spent because the line was not supposed to become permanent. Service increased in September 1997 to six departures per day (four peak, two reverse peak) and stations were added at Sainte-Rose and Henri-Bourassa (now Bois-de-Boulogne), the line had become permanent. The Rosemère station at Rosemère was built in 1998.\n\nTo make the operation successful, buses were used to carry passengers from areas around the stations in Blainville and Sainte-Thérèse. These buses came from the CIT des Basses-Laurentides (now CIT Laurentides). In Montreal, STCUM (now STM) buses were used from the Jean-Talon Station to downtown Montreal (Guy-Concordia) metro station (The 935 Trainbus Blainville / Centreville).\n\nIn 1999, the STCUM had problems with a number of buses in their Nova LFS fleet, pulling them off the roads completely. To cope with the situation the AMT decided to extend the service from Parc metro directly downtown to Gare Windsor (now Lucien-L'Allier Terminus).\n\nA little later, a stop was added at the currently-existing Vendôme station.\n\nIn late 2003, a stop was added at Montréal-Ouest. Trains previously passed through the station without stopping.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the De la Concorde overpass in Laval in October 2006, the AMT opened the temporary station Vimont on Bellerose Boulevard in anticipation of increased ridership. The AMT also leased eight bilevel coaches and one F59PH locomotive from GO Transit to allow for additional trains in the short term. In November the highway was re-opened, and the leased train set was returned to GO Transit, but the Vimont station became a permanent stop on the line.\nOn January 8, 2007, the line was extended from Blainville to Saint-Jérôme, the new Chabanel station was also opened, and a new schedule was released. As a result, only 10 round trips are made per day, instead of 11.\n\nOn April 28, 2007, along with the opening of the metro to Laval, the De La Concorde station was opened. The Saint-Martin station was closed because of its proximity to De La Concorde.\n\nIn 2013, work was completed to double the track between Sainte-Rose station and Saint-Martin Junction and install Automatic Train Control (ATC) between Parc station and the end of the line in Saint-Jérôme. Various upgrading at different stations is ongoing and will be complete by November 2013. The $50-million project allowed for the addition of six weekday departures on August 5, 2013.\n\nOn June 1, 2017, the AMT was dissolved and replaced by two new governing bodies, the Autorité régionale de transport métropolitain (ARTM) and the Réseau de transport métropolitain (RTM). The RTM took over all former AMT services, including this line, and changed its name to Exo in May 2018.\n\nThe ARTM is currently considering the following future projects:\n\nThere are 13 stations on the Saint-Jérôme Line:\n\n\n"}

All the other train lines have at least 4 stops before leaving the island.\n\nThe trains are owned and managed by Exo, and operated by Bombardier's Transportation division.\n\nToday, over 9,000 people ride this train daily.\n\nThis commuter route was opened by CN in 1859. Equipment in the late 1960s and early 1970s, operated once daily each direction, was a hodgepodge of ca 1930 coaches and an equally eclectic mix of yard switchers, freight and passenger diesel electric engines. Service was suspended in 1988, due to low ridership and old equipment used.\n\nDuring the Oka Crisis in the summer of 1990, the Société de transport de la communauté urbaine de Montréal (STCUM) organised a temporary rail shuttle service between Montreal Central Station and the town of Saint-Isidore due to the closure of the Honoré Mercier Bridge during said crisis. That service used part of the present-day Mont-Saint-Hilaire line between Montreal Central Station and Saint-Lambert station via Victoria Bridge, and then branched off to the CN Rouses Point Subdivision towards Saint-Isidore.\n\nThe Mont-Saint-Hilaire line was re-opened in 2000 (between Montreal Central Station and McMasterville) by the AMT as a measure to mitigate traffic congestion caused by roadwork.

The freight cars derailed on the Saint-Laurent Railway Bridge used by the train service. This was one of the longest disruptions in train service for the AMT. High winds were a factor in that derailment. In September 2013 CP banned AMT's multilevel coaches from the bridge during high wind conditions (85 km/h or more), deeming them potentially unstable in such conditions.

After success with Opera Australia, Olsen briefly joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. He returned to Australia in 1971 playing in theatre as well as Gilbert and Sullivan over the next four decades. He also sang Noël Coward songs in his cabaret act and acted in films, television and radio.\n\nOlsen was born in Adelaide, South Australia, and is of Danish descent. He originally trained for a professional career as a pianist. He decided to become an actor and attended the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney, graduating in 1962. He has appeared with the following theatre companies: Old Tote Theatre Company, State Theatre Company of South Australia, Melbourne Theatre Company and Sydney Theatre Company. Some of the plays in which Olsen has appeared include: \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", \"The Crucible\" and \"The Venetian Twins\".\n\nIn 1969, Olsen attracted notice as a guest artist playing the patter roles in the Australian Opera's productions of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", \"Iolanthe\" and \"The Pirates of Penzance\". He then joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in England. In 1970–71, Olsen spent a season in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company understudying John Reed in the comic roles, as well as being a member of the chorus, and touring both England and the European continent during his tenure with the company. He hoped to become John Reed's successor in the comic roles with D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, but returned to Australia when it became clear that John Reed had no intention of retiring from the company for some time.\n\nHe rejoined Australian Opera in 1971–72, playing Ko-Ko in \"The Mikado\" and the Duke of Plaza-Toro in \"The Gondoliers\" in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. The following year, he starred in \"An Ideal Husband\" and \"The Cherry Orchard\" on tour in Australia. For the latter, he won Melbourne's Erik Award for best actor of the year.

It was later also screened on the Seven Network. It was part of a trilogy and followed on from the six part serial \"The Interpretaris\" in 1966 and seven part serial \"Vega 4\" in 1968. However, it had 26 standalone episodes produced to make it viable as a syndicated series. Each of the series had different crews and casts but took place in the same future and used the same space organisation and miniatures, much as \"Star Trek\" did in the '80s and '90s, thus making it the first TV sci-fi franchise.\n\nThe series was set in the year 2500 AD and followed the adventures of the crew of the galactic patrol ship Phoenix Five, \"the most sophisticated craft in the Earth Space Control Fleet.\" This handpicked team consisted of Captain Roke, a typical heroic Kirk-style commander with a solution to every problem; Ensign Adam Hargraves, his stalwart young second-in-command always ready to shoot first and skip the questions; compassionate young navigator Cadet Tina Kulbrick; and their clunky, glass-domed Computeroid robot Karl. Together they patrolled the outer galaxies defending the innocent and warding off the repeated plots and attacks of the evil balding, blue-skinned humanoid Zodian of Zebula 9 and the eccentric pointy-eared renegade scientist Platonus.\n\nZodian originally appeared in \"Vega 4\", and he and his head-shaped twin computers Alpha and Zeta were in the first 13 episodes of \"Phoenix Five\", then were replaced by Platonus and his Cockney-accented computer Tommy for the latter half. This was due to a production break caused by the untimely death of producer Peter Summerton. Summerton had produced the popular and very controversial drama series \"You Can't See 'round Corners\" for ATN 7 the previous year, and was replaced by John Walters.\n\n\"Phoenix Five\" was produced in 1969 in Sydney by Artransa Park Television in association with the Australian Broadcasting Commission and Amalgamated Television Services. The series premiered on ABC television on Friday 24 April 1970 at 5:40pm with other states following in May 1970. It also was sold internationally and screened in the UK and other overseas markets in the 1970 & 1980s. It was repeated on the ABC in 1975 with the advent of Colour TV and last screened on ATN 7 and regional stations including WIN 4 Wollongong in the early 80's. All episodes exist complete in The National Sound and Film Archive but there has been no commercial release of the series, though odd eps of \"Interpretaris\" and \"Vega 4\" and a dozen or so off air recordings of \"Phoenix Five\" have circulated among TV collectors since the 90's and found their way to YouTube at various times.\n\nThe series has often been belittled as a \"Star Trek with gumtrees\" but the original \"Interpretaris\" was made before \"Star Trek\" screened in Australia and it resembles more the children's TV space adventure series of the Fifties and Sixties like \"Rocky Jones, Space Ranger\" and \"Fireball XL5\", which had been screened a number of times on Australian Television. It also has been criticized for its low budget, but being made on film and in colour would have made it more expensive than most Australian dramas of this period. Australia at this time did not have the numerous movie and TV spfx technicians that worked on US and UK productions and FX supervisor Peter Hicks really had to start from scratch. Indeed, costumes for the series were very expensive, ranging from floor-length robes for Zodian, pink tights for the 'microbe' girl (played by Arna-Maria Winchester) from the Planet Leonicus (from episode 3- To end is to begin), gold lame suits for the Phoenix Five crew and an aluminium suit for Karl the robot, with a perspex head covering fibreglass bulbs. Hicks said, of creating the 'Galaxy Garden' aboard the Phoenix Five: \"I got ordinary commercial plastic plants and butchered them to make them look strange. In one sequence I made a gun to fire corrosive liquid onto the plants to make them shrivel up.\"\n\n\n"}

Bassarab is a two time Stampede International Tag Team champion. Wrestling historian Dave Meltzer described Bassarab as a semi-spectacular in-ring performer.\n\nBorn in 1960 he is the son of Betty and Rusty Bassarab. He has two sisters named Whitney and Wendy and a brother, Rusty. Betty died of cancer in the early 80s and his father died in the late 90s. He grew up in Elbow Park, Calgary. Bassarab played hockey and football with the Glencoe Club. He also rode in some rodeos.\n\nAround 1981 Bassarab was encouraged by his future brother-in-law Davey Boy Smith to pursue pro wrestling.\n\nBassarab was trained by Stu Hart and debuted in Hart's Calgary, Alberta based Stampede Wrestling promotion under his own name in 1983. Bassarab formed a tag team with Phil Lafleur. They faced Danny Davis and Hubert Gallant for the Stampede International Tag Team Championship in early 1984, but the match was ruled a no-contest and the title was vacated.\n\nThe acquisition of Stampede by Vince McMahon (owner of the World Wrestling Federation, WWF) in 1985 led to many Stampede wrestlers being signed by the WWF. The British Bulldogs, Jim Neidhart, Owen Hart, and Bret Hart were all hired, but Bassarab was not. When Ben was going to sign on when Agent at the time Chief Jay Strongbow asked Ben when he could start, Ben replied that he could start today. Strongbow said that he would want Ben to give his 2-week notice with Stampede. Ben replied to Jay that Stu fired him as he and Allison split up. Jay told Ben that he hopes that Stu will not mind as his son Marc was going to live and train at Stu place and he hopes that this will not be a conflict, if it is that Jay told Ben that he would have to wait. Stu tried to use this leverage against Ben and told Ben that if he gets back together then he would get hired with WWF. Ben declined though he did face WWF wrestler Brutus Beefcake at the Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on July 28, 1985. Bassarab substituted for the absent Tony Garea and lost to Beefcake.\n\nBassarab began pursuing the International Tag Team Championship once more and began teaming with Chris Benoit. On March 1, 1986 in Regina, Saskatchewan, Bassarab and Benoit defeated Honky Tonk Man, Wayne Farris, and Rotten Ron Starr for the International Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Farris and his new partner, The Cuban Assassin, on March 21 in Calgary.\n\nBassarab then formed a new team with his brother-in-law, Owen Hart. On August 9 in Edmonton, Alberta they defeated Duke Myers and Kerry Brown for the International Tag Team Championship. They held the title until October 3, when they lost to The Viet Cong Express (Hiroshi Hase and Fumihiro Niikura) in Calgary. Bassarab and Owen feuded with the Express throughout Western Canada, on one occasion fighting to a forty-five-minute draw, but were unable to regain the International Tag Team Championship.\n\nBassarab remained with Stampede for the remainder of his career. During the 80s Bassarab took short tours in Japan, working for Japan Pro-Wrestling, and All Japan Pro Wrestling. In 1987 Bassarab worked for the North American Wrestling Association. He also worked for the WWF when they toured Alberta in the 80s, and retired in 1992.\n\nHe married Stu Hart's daughter Alison Hart in May 1983. They were married briefly, before leaving Alison when she was pregnant with their second daughter. They have two children, Lindsay and Brooke, both children are close to Davey Boy Smith's children.\n\nBrooke is Married to wrestler Peter Minnema, better known under his ring name, Pete Wilson.\n\nBassarab regularly visited B.J's Gym in Calgary, which was owned by his brother-in-law B.J. Annis. He also worked in the juice bar at the gym for some time before becoming a wrestler.\n\nIn 1988 Bassarab was stabbed in a barfight, the incident damaged his liver severely.\n\nAfter divorcing Hart he remarried at some point. He and his new wife attended both of the two funeral services for former brother-in-law Davey Boy Smith held by Smith's girlfriend Andrea Redding, and the other was held by former sister-in-law Diana Hart-Smith.\n\nBassarab later became a truck driver and, later, a warehouse foreman before retiring to run a vending machine and real estate company that he and his wife Kathy owned in Calgary. They sold of the business and moved down to the Maritimes. When asking Ben why he replied he just wanted peace in his life.\n\n\n"}

His studies focused on Viet Nam and other South-East Asian cultures.\n\nHe was born in Bourges to an academic family, and grew up in northern Viet Nam (Tonkin). In 1907 his father opened the College de Protectorate in Hanoi and he would graduate from the college some 12 years later.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II he was serving as a platoon commander leading a colonial unit in combat at Valvin and Sully-sur-Loire for which he would be awarded the Croix de Guerre. In 1942 he joined the Free French Forces in Africa. He trained with British commandos in Ceylon in 1944-1945 and then in January 1945 he was parachuted into Tonkin to rally French and Vietnamese to the Free French cause. He was in Hanoi on 9 March when the Japanese overthrew the Vichy French administration and he then escaped the city and walked to join up with French colonial forces retreating into southern China.\n\nOn September 2, 1945, he was with General Philippe Leclerc on the to receive the Surrender of Japan for France and subsequently served as his political advisor when France returned to Indochina and started the colonial reconquest.\n\nIn 1947, Mus became the political advisor to Émile Bollaert, the new French High Commissioner of Indochina.

{"id": "2193785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193785", "title": "Elliot Stabler", "text": "Elliot Stabler\n\nElliot Stabler is a fictional character portrayed by Christopher Meloni and one of the lead characters on the NBC police procedural series \"\" during the first 12 seasons. As a result of Meloni's sudden departure from the cast at the end of the twelfth season, Stabler abruptly retires from the police force off-screen during the Season 13 premiere. In April 2020, it was announced that Meloni would reprise the role for a new \"SVU\"-spinoff series, where Stabler comes out of retirement to lead an NYPD organized crime task force.\n\nStabler is an NYPD detective 1st Grade with Manhattan's 16th Precinct, which investigates sex crimes. He joined the NYPD in 1986, and became a detective with the SVU in 1993 where he has been partnered with Detective Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) for approximately one year prior to the time-frame of the show's first episode. Stabler is dedicated to his job but often takes cases personally, thus affecting his judgment. Nonetheless, Stabler has a 97% case-closure rate as of 2007. His badge number is 6313.\n\nStabler is Irish American and lives at 72-12 Castleside Street, Glen Oaks, Queens with his wife Kathy (Isabel Gillies) and five children (Maureen, Kathleen, Richard \"Dickie\", Elizabeth \"Lizzie\", and Elliot \"Eli\" Jr.). Stabler was born October 20, 1966. He is devoted to his family and frequently mentions or thinks about them while working cases. He is also a practicing Catholic whose faith sometimes complicates the cases on which he works.\n\nSeries creator Dick Wolf named \"SVU\"s two lead detectives after his son, Elliot, and his daughter, Olivia. Executive producer and head writer Neal Baer has explained that, in contrast to Benson – \"the empathetic, passionate voice for these victims\" – Stabler embodies \"the rage we feel, the 'How can this happen?' feeling.\" Of their partnership, Baer assessed that: \"They both represent the feelings that we feel simultaneously when we hear about these cases. That's why they work so well together.\"\n\nStabler was born and raised in Bayside, Queens. His father, Joseph Stabler, was a policeman who lost his pension and eventually died of cancer. Stabler had a difficult relationship with his father, who physically and emotionally abused him. His mother, Bernadette (née McGinley) (Ellen Burstyn), has bipolar disorder and once nearly killed her son during a manic episode. As a result, Stabler has \"erased his childhood\"; he rarely talks about his father and maintains little contact with his mother.\n\nStabler was a Marine and served in Operation Desert Storm. During his time in the military, he was a hand-to-hand combat specialist. He also has three tattoos, notably the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor tattoo on his forearm (the official emblem of the Marine Corps), and the crucifixion of Christ on his left bicep. One of his best friends died in the September 11 attacks. He has a B.A. from Queens College, which he obtained by going to night classes.\n\nStabler harbors a great deal of anger that is sometimes fueled by his job. He is often openly aggressive and intimidating toward suspects, which can either complicate the case further or lead to speedy confessions. When his wife Kathy (Isabel Gillies) leaves him in Season 6, Stabler's anger rises closer to the surface and in a few episodes threatens to boil over. One such instance occurs when Stabler investigates serial killer Gordon Rickett (Matthew Modine), whom he had investigated 14 years earlier. During interrogation, Ricketts tells Stabler that they harbor the same kind of rage, and that if it weren't for his family and his job, Stabler would be just like him. When Benson and Stabler catch Rickett about to murder a young girl, Stabler appears ready to kill him in cold blood; it's only Benson's intervention that prevents him from doing so.\n\nIn Season 7, he goes to see a police psychiatrist, Dr. Rebecca Hendrix (Mary Stuart Masterson), after using excessive force on an abusive parent. Stabler eventually opens up to Hendrix about his personal demons, and they become close until Hendrix is transferred. By Season 9, he and Kathy reconcile, and Stabler learns to better deal with his problems.\n\nIn the Season 12 finale, Stabler is forced to shoot and kill a young woman who opens fire in the Special Victims squad room. Before dying in Stabler's arms, she had killed two suspects involved in the rape and murder of her mother and injured a third, as well as killing recurring character (Charlayne Woodard). After the shootout, Stabler is placed on administrative leave by the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau. Although he is eventually cleared, this shooting is the sixth such incident in his NYPD career. His superior, Captain Donald Cragen (Dann Florek), comments that if Stabler wants to keep his job, he will have to undergo a psychological evaluation, take an anger management class, and submit to a review of his entire personnel file by the IAB. Benson is confident that Stabler will not agree to these terms, and he proves her right by retiring from the force off-screen during the Season 13 premiere.\n\nHe married his wife, Kathy (Isabel Gillies), when they were both 17 years old, and at the beginning of the series, they have four school-aged children: Maureen (Erin Broderick), Kathleen (Alison Siko), and twins Richard \"Dickie\" (Jeffrey Scaperrotta), and Elizabeth \"Lizzie\". Richard (he stopped using his nickname upon entering adolescence) is named after Col. Richard Finley (James Brolin), Stabler's former commanding officer in the Marines, whom Stabler later arrests after discovering that he murdered a woman.\n\nAfter years of the stress involved with being married to a police officer, Kathy leaves Stabler, taking their children, and temporarily moves in with her mother. Following a case involving a divorce that turned violent, Stabler signs the divorce papers, saying, \"when love warps to hate, there's nothing you won't do.\" However, after being cleared in the death of a suspect, Stabler realizes that he cannot bear to lose either his job or his family, so he seeks reconciliation with his wife. A short time later, Kathy announces that she is pregnant and asks Stabler to come home. After a serious car accident, Kathy delivers a healthy baby boy, Elliot Stabler Jr. (Eli) (born November 17, 2007). Kathy nearly dies as a result of the crash, but paramedics are able to save her.\n\nOf his five children, Kathleen and Dickie have most directly affected his job. Kathleen is twice charged with DUI; he uses his clout as a police officer to make the first charge disappear, but he eventually realizes that he has to let her face the consequences of her actions, and she is sentenced to community service. Kathleen then steals her father's credit card and gives it to her boyfriend, who rings up thousands of dollars in charges. She is later arrested for breaking and entering and robbery, at which time doctors and her family realize that she suffers from bipolar disorder, which is a condition she shares with her paternal grandmother, Bernadette. When she faces prison time, Stabler reaches out to his mother for the first time in three years and asks her to tell Kathleen about her illness so she will get help. After speaking with her grandmother, Kathleen agrees to treatment. She later becomes an advocate for sexual assault victims, and in one episode, helps her father on a case.\n\nDickie also occasionally gives his father problems. In a Season 11 episode, he runs away from school and tries to join the Army, something Stabler disapproves of. It later turns out that Dickie is acting out because his friend, Shane, has been murdered. Stabler refuses to sign a parental consent form for Dickie to join the Army, but resolves to be a more attentive parent.\n\nStabler is fiercely protective of his children and becomes defensive if a suspect asks about his family; it is suggested that he sees aspects of his children in every victim. As a result, he harbors an intense hatred of pedophiles, admitting to a police psychiatrist that he sometimes fantasizes about killing them. He almost loses his job as a result. In a later episode, he beats up a pedophile (Tom Noonan) who posts a picture of his daughter Elizabeth on his website.\n\nStabler has occasionally seen aspects of himself in a child abuser; during one case, the actions of an abusive parent prompt him to recall an incident in which he lost his temper and raised his hand to slap his daughter Maureen, who was a toddler at the time.\n\nChild victims tend to respond to him. For example, Stabler successfully reaches out to a 15-year-old girl (Rachael Bella) who regresses to a childlike state after being attacked by her father. SVU's resident psychiatrist, Dr. George Huang (B.D. Wong), theorizes that only Stabler would be able to reach her, as he is a father, and she is looking for a father figure.\n\nStabler is partnered with Olivia Benson for the series' first 12 seasons. They are best friends, and trust each other completely. Stabler is Benson's longest relationship with a man, and they have even each promised to give the other a kidney should they need a transplant.\n\nTheir relationship is not without friction, however. The two sometimes argue over the cases they work on; Benson tends to be quicker to side with the victims. For example, during a case in which three women are charged with raping a male stripper, Benson and ADA Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) believe the man's story, while Stabler takes a cynical view of his claim from the start.\n\nBenson and Stabler are separated at times during the show. She asks for a new partner after Stabler expects her to jeopardize his life to shoot a convicted sex offender (Lou Diamond Phillips) who had kidnapped two children and killed one of them. Instead, she is briefly reassigned to computer crimes and replaced by a Queens SVU detective, Lucius Blaine (Anthony Anderson). Benson and Stabler become partners again in the eighth season. They remain partners for the rest of Stabler's time in the precinct.\n\nIn the Season 12 episode \"Merchandise,\" Benson and Stabler are temporarily appointed as Special Deputy U.S. Marshals so they can arrest the leaders of a human trafficking operation located outside their jurisdiction. Once the criminals are in custody, they turn in the badges and take up their positions in SVU again.\n\nStabler is assigned a temporary partner named (Connie Nielsen) while Benson is undercover in Oregon, embedded in an eco-terrorist group at the request of the FBI in season 8 (Mariska Hargitay was pregnant and on maternity leave). Beck takes well to the job, and she and Stabler become close. There is also some sexual tension between the two, and during one case, they share a kiss. The relationship goes no further, however, as Beck leaves when she realizes that she will not be able to save every victim.\n\nJo Marlowe (played by Sharon Stone) was Stabler's training officer. She is appointed by District Attorney Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) to be the new ADA for the SVU squad during a four-episode run in Season 11. Stabler reveals that he has not seen her for 15 years when she first arrives as the new ADA. Marlowe was a lieutenant in 1995 when she left the NYPD after her command decision resulted in the deaths of two of her officers. She was diagnosed with an \"aggressive\" type of breast cancer and had a bilateral radical mastectomy a year before joining the SVU squad.\n\nFor the role of Stabler, the finalists were Meloni, Tim Matheson, and John Slattery. Meloni and Hargitay had auditioned in the final round together, and after the actors left, there was a moment of dead silence, after which Wolf blurted out, \"Oh well. There's no doubt who we should choose – Hargitay and Meloni.\" The duo, who Wolf believed had the perfect chemistry from the first time he saw them together, were his first choice. Garth Ancier, head of NBC, agreed, and the rest of the panel assembled voiced their assent.\n\nIn May 2009, after the show's , Hargitay and Meloni's contracts expired when they were reportedly making $375,000–$385,000 per episode. During negotiations in April for a new contract, the actors attempted to receive a percentage of the show's profits. It was rumored that NBC threatened to replace Hargitay and Meloni if they persisted in their demands. Two months later, however, it was officially reported that both their contracts had been renewed for two more years.\n\nIn May 2011, Meloni announced that he would not be returning to \"SVU\" in fall 2011 for its 13th season after the failure of negotiations over a new contract. The Stabler character was subsequently written out of the show.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, NBC announced that it had ordered a 13 episode series with Meloni reprising his role as Stabler in an as-yet-untitled drama series, produced by Dick Wolf. The series will center around an organized crime taskforce headed by Stabler. Meloni will also return as Stabler for the Season 22 premiere of \"SVU\". \n\nMeloni was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2006, in the category of Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, for his role as Elliot Stabler.\n\nThe following are the medals and service awards worn by Elliot Stabler, as seen in \"Dolls.\"\n"}
{"id": "2193787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193787", "title": "Spokane House", "text": "Spokane House\n\nSpokane House was a fur-trading post founded in 1810 by the British-Canadian North West Company, located on a peninsula where the Spokane River and Little Spokane River meet. When established, it was the North West Company's farthest outpost in the Columbia River region. An American rival of the NWC, the Pacific Fur Company opened a station adjacent to Spokane House, called Fort Spokane. The War of 1812 and ongoing supply issues caused the collapse of the PFC, with its posts now under the control of the NWC. The original Spokane House was abandoned in favor of Fort Spokane, though the latter location was still called Spokane House. The second Spokane House saw use as a major post in the interior Oregon Country until the NWC was absorbed by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1821. During a general tour of the Pacific Northwest, Spokane House was abandoned by George Simpson in 1825, in favor of a new post that became Fort Colvile. The site of Spokane House is in Spokane County in the U.S. state of Washington, just northwest of the city of Spokane.\n\nSpokane House was created under direction of David Thompson and built by Jaco Finlay during the winter of 1810–1811. Finlay would remain among the Sqeliz until Thompson's return later in 1811. Visiting the station in June 1811, Thompson noted that Spokane House was the place \"where I left a small assortment of Goods to continue the trade, there were forty Tents of Spokane Indians, with Jaco, a half breed, as Clerk.\" Thompson would soon depart for the mouth of the Columbia River, discovering the rival Fort Astoria. \n\nFort Spokane was a competing station opened by the Pacific Fur Company, a venture headquartered at Fort Astoria and funded solely by John Jacob Astor. The arrival of an expedition originating in St. Louis led by W. Price Hunt along with sorely needed supplies and reinforcements from the \"Beaver\" early in 1812 allowed to company to establish more trade posts to compete against the NWC. Among the various parties directed to leave Fort Astoria for the interior was an outfit headed by John Clarke. This party was directed to create \"a district headquarters for trade in what is now eastern Washington and Oregon, northern Idaho, and western Montana.\" This group was directed to open a station in proximity to the Spokane House.\n\nRelations with the neighboring Sqeliz were peaceable, with the post gate often left open at night. Illim-Spokanee, the father of Spokane Garry, would trade with both fur company posts. Despite being competitors, talks with NWC employees at Spokane House were amicable. McMillan agreed to join Clarke in not selling alcohol to the natives. Parties of traders were supplied to trade with neighboring Indigenous nations in an effort to counter the NWC. François Pillet led a party of six to reside with the Ktunaxa to oppose the Kootanae House and Russel Farnham commanded a group of men to near Saleesh House in the Bitterroot Salish homeland. Leaving Farnham's group, Ross returned to the post shortly before 1 January 1813. The PFC laborers had as Ross recalled:\"a snug and commodious dwelling-house, containing four rooms and a kitchen; together with a comfortable house for the men, and a capacious store for the furs and trading goods; the whole surrounded by paling, and flanked by two bastions with loopholes for musketry. When the Astorian wintering parties returned in early May, departure for Fort Astoria was set for 25 May 1813. The majority of the PFC laborers were in this party, with four men under Pillet left at Fort Spokane. Reaching Fort Astoria in August, the group learned the unfortunate news of the War of 1812 and consensus to sell the PFC assets, including Fort Spokane, to the NWC.\n\nOperations based at Spokane House were relocated to Fort Spokane, though the PFC station took the NWC station's name. It became was the North West Company's central depot in the Oregon Country interior but problems with the location of Spokane House were evident. Spokane House was poorly connected to other posts and reliant upon transport by large pack trains, rather than being able to use water transport. This made the company dependent upon the Nez Perce for a supply of horses. During this annual transportation of trade goods to Spokane House, thirty five to forty men were employed by the NWC. Despite several proposals to abandon Spokane House, it remained popular among company employees. Fort Nez Percés was ranked as the main interior post in 1818.\n\nThe Hudson's Bay Company took over control of the NWC in 1821 and sent George Simpson to tour the new western possessions of the HBC throughout 1824 and 1825. He visited the station accompanied by John McLoughlin, McMillian, and Peter Skene Ogden late in October 1824. Many of laborers that worked at Spokane House and its subsidiary stations of the Flathead Post and Kootanae House did not receive favorable reviews by Simpson. In particular he found many lazy, \"the very scum of the country... the most unruly and troublesome gang... are under no control & feel their own independence, they therefore require very superior management to make anything of them...\" Simpson reduced the employees stationed at Spokane House for 1825 by seven, leaving only fifteen.\n\nSimpson returned to the station in April 1825. He began discussions with the Spokane House management to abandon Spokane House in favor of the Kettle Falls. This was due to several reasons including, the distance of Spokane House from the Columbia River, the scarcity of fur bearing populations in the area, and the abundance of fish and promising agricultural prospects at the latter location. That year work began near Kettle Falls on a new fur post, Fort Colvile.\n\nIn 1846 by the Oregon Treaty, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ceded all claims to lands in the Pacific Northwest south of the 49th parallel to the United States of America.\n\nArcheological digs were carried out at the Spokane House site in 1950–53 and 1962–63. The historic district was defined and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.\n\n"}

The current Headmaster is Dr John Weeds.\n\nThe school was founded after the death of the John Blubery, a yeoman of the King's Armoury. In his will he decreed that if the child of his daughter be a girl, then his mansion house be turned into a free school for the poor children of Cranbrook. Queen Elizabeth I granted the school charter in 1574, which is now housed in the library.\n\nIn 2003 alumnus Piers Sellers, a NASA astronaut, took a copy of the school charter into space with him. A photo is exhibited in the school cafeteria. In 2005 Sellers opened the school's observatory, which is named after him. This observatory houses the 22.5 inch Alan Young telescope operated by the Cranbrook and District Science and Astronomy Society (CADSAS). In May 2010 Sellers took into outer space aboard the Space Shuttle an original watercolour portrait of Cranbrook School painted by Brenda Barratt. The painting was later returned to Cranbrook School with the official NASA verification that it has travelled into space. In 2018, a new day house specifically for the 120 students in Years 7 and 8 was named after Piers Sellers.\n\nIn December 2019, current headteacher John Weeds announced he is leaving at the end of the academic year.\n\nBarham House is the school’s main office. It contains the reception room, the offices of both the headmaster and the deputy head, and meeting rooms. The school medical centre is also in Barham House, but has its own reception and entrance. The building was originally the local vicarage.\nCentral to the school, there is a large library which is one of the oldest parts of the school. It was once the school hall, but it was converted to the library after the amount of pupils became to big to fit in the hall. School assemblies are currently held in the local church, St Dunstan’s, or the Queen’s Hall Theatre. The library also plays host to the original royal charter provided to the school by Queen Elizabeth I in 1588.\nThe school is home to the local theatre, the Queen’s Hall. It is used for a number of both internal (performed and organised by students) and external productions, as well as some school assemblies. Many external productions are performed by Cranbrook Operatic and Dramatic Society (CODS). The school has their own technical team who help with most internal productions.\n\nSince September 2019, the school has five day houses and six boarding houses. Formerly the day houses Allan, Horsley and Webster were split along gendered lines with the total number of houses (both day and boarding arriving at: seven for boys and five for girls. The reasons for the recent merger were not provided but rumours circulated among the student body that it was due to the increasing visibility of transgender students. Each house works in conjunction with the main school to provide pastoral care and academic support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This convergence leads to treacherous sailing conditions, accounting for numerous wrecked ships in the area over the years. However the meeting of the oceans here also fuels the nutrient cycle for marine life, making it one of the best fishing grounds in South Africa.\n\nThe Agulhas Bank stretches approximately along the African coast, from off Cape Peninsula (18°E) to Port Alfred (26°E), and up to from it. The bank is deep near the coast and reaches before dropping steeply to on its southern edge.\nThe shelf spans an area of with a mean depth slightly over .\n\nThe National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment 2004 recognised 34 biozones nested within 9 bioregions (of which four were offshore). The National Biodiversity Assessment 2011 replaced these ecozones and biozones with the terms ecoregions and ecozones. In 2011, the Agulhas Ecoregion was divided into four distinct ecozones: Agulhas inshore, Agulhas inner shelf, Agulhas outer shelf, and Agulhas shelf edge. 33 different benthic habitats types were identified on the Agulhas Bank.\n\nThere are dozens of warm temperate reefs along the coast of the Agulhas Ecoregion spanning from below sea level. Many rocky sub-tidal reefs are of aeolianite or sandstone origin, but granite, quartzite and siltstone reefs are also present. The Agulhas reefs are very heterogeneous and include several possible different sub-types. Some of the reefs are within protected areas, but only a few of those protected areas include protection from fishing.\n\nThe Agulhas Bank is a natural boundary between ocean currents from the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Southern Ocean, resulting in one of the most turbulent waters of the world oceans.\n\nThe Agulhas Current flows south along the African east-coast and along the south-eastern edge of the bank. It then retroflects back into the Indian Ocean south-west of the bank. This retroflection results in intense eddy activities such as meanders, eddies, and filaments.\nIn upper layer water, the Agulhas rings and eddies move warm and salty water into the large South Atlantic gyre, which exports it to the tropics. In the lower ocean layers water is transported in the opposite direction.\n\nCyclonic eddies is another source of edge upwelling west of Port Elisabeth. Plumes of warm surface water migrate onto the bank along its eastern edge, providing subtropical surface water from the Indian Ocean.\nIn summer, easterly winds can intermittently drive coastal upwelling along the South African south coast.\nThe Agulhas Bank is dominated by westerly winds and most of the upwelling on the bank is related to the interaction of the Agulhas Current on the eastern edge, but easterly winds do occur, especially in summer and fall, and can generate local upwelling cells.\n\nAs the current is diverged away from the coast, dynamic processes draws an onshore Ekman layer of cold water from below the warm shelf-edge flow. In spring and summer, at a depth of , a semi-permanent ridge of cold water is present on the eastern and central shelf.\n\nIn summer, there is mixture of subtropical water separated by thermoclines from cool waters, but there is a considerable seasonal variation. On the shelf, bottom waters exhibit characteristics of the central Indian Ocean in the east and central Atlantic Ocean waters in the west.\n\nAs the Agulhas Current flows south along the African east coast, it tends to bulge inshore frequently, a deviation from the current's normal path known as Agulhas Current meanders (ACM). These bulges are occasionally (1-7 times per year) followed by a much larger offshore bulge, known as Natal pulses (NP). Natal pulses move along the coast at per day. An ACM can bulge up to and a NP up to from the current's mean position.\nThe AC passes offshore and an ACM can reach offshore. When the AC meanders, its width broadens from to and its velocity weakens from to . An ACM induces a strong inshore counter-current.\n\nLarge-scale cyclonic meanders known as Natal pulses are formed as the Agulhas Current reaches the continental shelf on the South African east-coast (i.e. the eastern Agulhas Bank off Natal). As these pulses moves along the coast on the Agulhas Bank, they tend to pinch off Agulhas rings from the Agulhas Current. Such a ring shedding can be triggered by a Natal pulse alone, but sometimes meanders on the Agulhas Return Current merge to contribute to the shedding of an Agulhas ring.\n\nAgulhas rings are large anticyclonic eddies or warm core rings of ocean water that are pinched off the Agulhas Current along the eastern edge of the Agulhas Bank from where they move into the South Atlantic. As the Agulhas Current reaches the east coast of South Africa, large solitary meanders known as Natal pulses form at irregular intervals. 165 days after the appearance of a Natal pulse, an Agulhas ring is formed off Durban. The Agulhas rings are among the largest eddies in the world and play an important role in the Agulhas Leakage, the transport of warm water from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean, which affects the global climate.\n\nThe average diameter of the Agulhas rings is , but they can reach 500 km. They extend down to the ocean floor; circulate at ; and move into the South Atlantic at /day. Only half of the Agulhas eddies that leave the Cape Basin manage to cross the Walvis Ridge and those that do tend to lose half their energy before reaching the ridge within six months. The Agulhas rings transport an estimated 1-5 Sv (millions m²/s) of water from the Indian Ocean to the South Atlantic.\n\nThe Agulhas rings are thought to be of global climatic importance. Their delivery of warm water from the Indian to the Atlantic Ocean can control the rate of thermohaline overturning of the entire Atlantic. Other factors contribute to various degrees to the inter-ocean exchanges in the region, including filaments from the Agulhas Current and intrusions of water from Antarctica. Cold, cyclonic eddies have been observed in the southwestern Atlantic.\nBased on model simulations, researchers have found that the interaction of the Agulhas Current and the eastern edge of the bank can result in the Agulhas rings.\n\nThe provenance of ocean sediments can be determined by analysing terrigenous strontium isotope ratios in deep ocean cores. Sediments underlying the Agulhas Current and Return Current have significantly higher ratios than surrounding sediments. Analyses of cores in the South Atlantic deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 20 000 years ago), show that the Agulhas leakage (shedding of Agulhas rings) was significantly reduced. It has been hypothesised that the reason for this was that the Agulhas Current was stronger which resulted in a more eastward retroflection and therefore less leakage. However, analyses of such cores south of Africa show that the trajectory of the current was the same during the LGM and that the reduced leakage must be explained by a weaker current. Consequently, it can be predicted that a stronger Agulhas Current will result in its retroflection occurring more eastward and an increased Agulhas leakage.\n\nCompared to the Agulhas Current, the Benguela Current on the west and south-west coast of Africa is more intense and steadier. Its dynamic southern upwelling system is driven by the prevailing northward winds that produce an intense off-shore Ekman transport. Most of this upwelling is concentrated to a few upwelling cells in the southern region: Namaqua (30°S), Cape Columbine (32.5°S), and Cape Peninsula (34°S). The wind is most intense from October to February, and the contrast in sea surface temperature between the open sea and the shelf is most prominent during summer.\n\nCoastal upwelling s also common on the western bank, but the more stable atmospheric condition results in larger cold water plumes that sometimes merge to form a continuous upwelling regime along the South African south-west coast. This upwelling zone is the southernmost extension of the Benguela Current Large Maritime Ecosystem. The Agulhas Current regularly flows around the southern tip of the bank and brings warm water to the western bank along the bank's western edge.\nRegularly, the mesoscale eddies from the east interact with the Benguela upwelling system on the African west coast.\n\nFloating south along the South American continental slope, the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) carries North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) into the South Atlantic. At about 8°S and at a depth of , the DWBC breaks into anticyclonic eddies during periods of strong meridional overturning circulation. One such NADW eddy was observed in 2003 and the researchers speculated that a deeply penetrating Agulhas ring pinched it off the NADW slope current. Spinning at , these deep-water eddies move around the southern tip of the Agulhas Bank and into the Indian Ocean. Most of the NADW flow (more than 7 Sv) meanders east around the Agulhas Plateau together with the surface Agulhas Return Current, but a smaller portion (3 Sv) continue north along the African east-coast as the Agulhas Undercurrent.\nOf 89.5 Sv released from the North Atlantic, 3.6 Sv leaves the South Atlantic south of the Agulhas Bank. However, 0.9 Sv recirculate in the basin north of the Walvis Ridge for centuries, of which 50-90% end up flowing south of the Agulhas Bank within 300 years, increasing the net inter-oceanic exchange with 4.1-4.5 Sv.\n\nThe oldest rock found along the coastline of the Agulhas Bank are eugeosynclinal sediments of the up to thick Kaaimans Group deposited during continental rifting some 900 million years ago (Mya). The proto-South Atlantic closed during the Saldanian orogeny to form part of the supercontinent Gondwana (700-600 Mya). The Cape granites were emplaced and the Kaaimans Group rocks were folded and thermally metamorphosed during this period. The formation of the main basin in the Cape Province commenced 570 Mya and lasted for 200 My. The Table Mountain Group is thick and an erosional unconformity marking its base is composed of both terrestrial and marine sediments. Synclines along the coast of the southern Cape contains sediments from the Bokkveld Group.\n\nThe Cape Fold Belt (CFB) rocks and the Karoo Basin were deposited 450 Mya; the Cape Supergroup 450-300 Mya during a series of transgression-regression cycles.\nPan-African thrusts were reactivated 270-215 Mya to form the CFB which was then part of a continuous fold belt that developed during the Gondwanide orogeny together with Sierra de la Ventana (Argentina), Pensacola Mountains (East Antarctica), and Ellsworth Mountains (West Antarctica). In the late Carboniferous and early Jurassic, the Karoo Supergroup was deposited in the Karoo Basin north of where the CFB is located today, and covering nearly two-thirds of present-day South Africa.\n\nBasaltic lavas were extruded 183 Mya to form the Karoo large igneous province; a volcanism caused by the Bouvet hotspot which is linked to the Gondwana break-up.\nThe Bouvet hotspot was located in or near present-day South Africa from the late Triassic 220 mya and until the Africa-Antarctica breakup 120 mya. The Bouvet hotspot track stretches south-east from the African continent, near the South Africa-Mozambique border, and east of the AFFZ down to Bouvet Island/Bouvet Triple Junction in the South Atlantic. 100 Mya, the region where the triple junction was located passed over the hotspot, resulting in a continuous eruption that lasted to about 94 Mya and the seafloor spreading that still separates Antarctica, Africa, and South America.\n\nThe Agulhas-Falkland Fracture Zone (AFFZ) stretches across the South Atlantic. It is one of the largest and most spectacular fracture zones on Earth. It developed during the Early Cretaceous as West Gondwana (=South America) broke up from Africa. The AFFZ is characterized by a pronounced topographic anomaly, the Agulhas Ridge (41°S,16°E-43°S,9°E) which rises more than 2 km above the surrounding sea floor. The only equivalent in size are the neighbouring Diaz Ridge and the Falkland Escarpment. The Agulhas Ridge is unique because it was not formed during the continental breakup during the Cretaceous and because it separates oceanic crusts of different age, and not oceanic crust (~14 km thick) from continental crust (25 km thick).\n\nNorth of the (AFFZ) is the Outeniqua Basin which is a complex system of sub-basins separated from each other by faults and basement arches; there are several smaller fault-bounded sub-basins in the north (Bredasdorp, Infanta, Pletmos, Gamtoos, and Algoa) and a distinctively deeper sub-basin in the south (the South Outeniqua Basin.) The sedimentary fill of these basins developed as the northern edge of the Falkland Plateau separated from the South African southern margin during the early Cretaceous.\n\nThe Diaz Marginal Ridge (DMR) separates these basins from the AFFZ. The DMR is buried under of sediments and sedimentary rocks and of this sedimentary material is undisturbed Cretaceous sediments younger than the oldest Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in the Southern Outeniqua Basin. The DMR must therefore have formed after the initial West Gondwana breakup 130-90 Mya. The DMR probably formed when new, hot oceanic crust slid past old, cold continental crust and the contrast in temperatures induced a thermal uplift.\n\nAs West Gondwana drifted away from Africa roughly 125 Myr, the South Atlantic seafloor formed between them and magnetic anomalies north of the AFFZ reflects phase of the seafloor spreading. South of the AFFZ traces can be found of how the Falkland Plateau and the Agulhas Bank moved relative to each other. On a modern map, the Falkland Plateau can still be rotated and fitted into the Natal Valley in the Indian Ocean east of South Africa.\nThe Agulhas Plateau is located southeast of the shelf, separated from it by the Agulhas Passage (through which the Agulhas Current flows.)\n\nOne of the largest known slumps occurred on the south-eastern edge of the Agulhas Bank in the Pliocene or more recently. Stretching from a depth of , the so-called Agulhas slump is long, wide, and has a volume of . It is a composite slump with proximal and distal allochthonous sediment masses separated by a large glide plane scar. In the western part, the sediments are dammed by basement ridges, but, in the eastern part, they have spread into the Transkei Basin. A series of slump scarps along the western edge of the shelf are 18–2 Mya, but covered by younger sediments brought there by the Benguela upwelling.\n\nAnatomically modern humans evolved around 200 kya. The genetic diversity in the human lineage is relatively low, which indicate one or several population bottlenecks late in our lineage. It has been estimated that the population was limited to perhaps 600 individuals during the MIS 6 glacial stage (195-125 kya), one of the longest cold periods in the Quaternary of Africa. A technological and behavioural revolution that occurred globally about 50 kya led to a cultural complexity which happened in South Africa around 120-70 kya.\n\nThe Cape Floral Region is a thin coastal strip and a botanic hotspot which developed at the confluence of the Benguela Upwelling and Agulhas Current. According to what professor Curtis Marean calls the \"Cape Floral Region – South Coast Model\" for the origins of modern humans, the early hunter-gatherers survived on shellfish, as well as geophytes, fur seal, fish, seabirds, and wash-ups found on the exposed Agulhas Bank. The bank slopes into the sea and a reconstruction of how the coastline has changed over 440 kya shows that the coast during the Pleistocene was located as far as from the present coast.\n\nThe present South African southern coastal plain (SCP) is still separated from the rest of Africa by the Cape Fold Belt. During glacial maxima the sea-level dropped . This not only left large parts of the Agulhas Bank exposed, which greatly expanded the area of the SCP, but it also reconnected the SCP to the rest of Africa by the shallow water shelves, which broke the isolation of the SCP. Modern humans evolved on the SCP and the fluctuation in sea-levels would have resulted in a significant variation in selective pressure. No fossil records are known from the now submerged shelf, but a series of key fossil sites along the coastal margin of the present SCP provide earliest traces of anatomically modern humans and the use of marine resources.\n\nSouth Africa began oil exploration on the Agulhas Bank in the 1980s. Of more than 200 offshore wells in South Africa, most are found on Bredasdorp Basin on the Agulhas Bank.\n\nThe Agulhas Bank is also significant for fisheries who use demersal trawling, demersal longline fishing, and midwater trawl fishing on the bank. Squid and small pelagic fishes are also caught. Before the introduction of the EEZ, foreign fisheries used roch-hopper gear trawling on the bank.\n\nMost of the catches are short-lived shelf-zone pelagic species and more long-lived deep-water species. The large populations of sardine and anchovy also present on the shelf follow an annual cycle. Anchovy spawn on the western Agulhas Bank in early summer while the sardines span over a broader season and area — eggs are transported by currents to the nursery area in the St Helena Bay on the South African west coast from where juvenile then migrate back to the Agulhas Bank to spawn.\n\nSouth Africa has a relatively large fishing industry mostly catching pelagic pilchard and anchovy and demersal Hake on the south and western coasts. Though the east coast has fewer commercial fisheries, the large human population along there has resulted in overexploitation of coastal fish and invertebrate stocks by recreational and subsistence fishers. A small aquaculture industry produces mussels and oysters offshore.\n\nSeveral pelagic species are heavily harvested by the commercial fleet: purse-seine fishery is used to catch sardines, anchovies, and round herring; mid-water trawl fishery to catch horse mackerel and chub mackerel; pelagic longline and pole fishery to catch tunas and swordfish; while hook and line are used inshore to catch squid and teleost species, including snoek and geelbek. All these species are relatively common and are considered having an important role in the ecosystem.\n\nThere are at least 12,914 marine species in South Africa, but small bodied species are poorly documented and the abyssal zone is almost completely unexplored. Almost a quarter of South Africa's coast line is protected, excluding deeper water. A third of the marine species are endemic to South Africa (though poor levels of taxonomic research in adjoining countries probably affects the apparent endemism.) The degree of endemism varies considerably among taxa: Bryozoa 64%, Mollusca 56%, Echinodermata 3.6%, Porifera 8.8%, Amphipoda 33%, Isopoda 85%, or Cumacea 71%.\nFisheries are one of the major threats to the biodiversity of the Agulhas Bank.\n\nCopepods comprise 90% of the zooplankton carbon on the Agulhas Bank, and are thus an important source of food for pelagic fish and juvenile squids. The population of \"Calanus agulhensis\", a large species that dominates the copepod community in terms of biomass, has a center of distribution on the central Agulhas Bank. Since 1997 the copepod biomass on the central Agulhas Bank has declined significantly while the biomass of pelagic fish has increased significantly. While it is likely that predation has played an important role in the copepod decline, global warming (sea surface temperature and Cholorphyll A abundance) is believed to have contributed to a smaller population.\n\nThe shelf edge along the bank's southern tip is subject to sporadic upwelling. This slope and its surrounding seamounts are the spawning ground for sardine, anchovy, and horse mackerel. Eddies help transport water inshore and link the spawning habitat with important nursery areas.\nEggs and larvae laid by the anchovy are transported via the Good Hope Jet to Africa's southwestern coast where they mature. Young anchovies then return to the Agulhas Bank to spawn.\nYoung sardine and anchovy congregate along the west coast between March and September before they migrate to their spawning grounds on the Agulhas Bank. Sardines of intermediate age are present on the western Agulhas Bank between January and April before migrating to KwaZulu-Natal for winter. The spawning on the Agulhas Bank takes place offshore from September to February.\n\nThe bank is the spawning area of deep reef fish species, including the threatened endemic red steenbras (\"Petrus rupestris\"). Other species have been overexploited, including daggerhead seabream or dageraad (\"Chrysoblephus cristiceps\"), black musselcracker (\"Cymatoceps nasutus\"), and silver kob (\"Argyrosomus inodorus\").\n\n57 species of sharks have been reported off the western coast of South Africa, of which 21 are squaloid sharks.\n\nThe main food source for African penguins (\"Spheniscus demersus\") is anchovy and sardine which they forage between Cape Columbine and the central Agulhas Bank. The birds have colonies on Dassen Island, on the South African west coast, and Bird Island, on the south coast.\nAfrican penguins breed opportunistically, following the anchovy and sardine: from February to September on the Western Cape but from January to July on St Croix Island off Eastern Cape. After breeding, the birds forage further offshore: off the western coast and up to from their colonies off Eastern Cape.\n\nIn 2005, when Korean and Philippine vessels started longline fishing along the edges of the Agulhas Bank, seabird bycatch became a huge problem. Large numbers of albatrosses and petrels were killed — in average 0.6 birds per 1000 hooks, but up to 18 birds per 1000 hooks were reported. Since 2007, however, more restrictive permit conditions for foreign-flagged fleets and the use of birds scaring lines have decreased the number of killed birds by 85%.\n\nCape fur seals are present along the South African coast. Fur seals are protected in South Africa since 1893 although a small number are occasionally culled to protect sea birds. Many seals are caught in fishery nets and boat propellers, but the seals are also regularly accused of stealing fish from the fisheries. Sharks are known to prey on them, but in 2012 a cape fur seal was observed preying on and consuming a mid-sized blue shark.\n\n51 species, or more than 50%, of the recognized species of cetaceans are present in the southern African subregion (between the equator and the Antarctic ice edge), of which 36 have been sighted in South African and Namibian waters.\n\nA vulnerable population of fish-eating killer whales are present offshore on the Agulhas Bank. Observations peak in January while few are sighted in April and May. The killer whales move in pods of 1-4 individuals and are mostly sited over the shelf edge off the south-east coast.\nAn analysis of killer whale mtDNA has shown that there was a peak inter-oceanic migration events during the Eemian interglacial period, 131-114 kya. This peak coincides with a period of maximal Agulhas leakage which promoted a rapid and episodic interchange of killer whale lineages. During this period killer whales and other marine top predators, such as the great white shark, colonised the North Atlantic and Mediterranean by following their prey — bluefin tuna and swordfish.\n\nA vagrant Commerson's dolphin — a species with two isolated populations, one along the southern coast of Argentina and the other around the Kerguelen Islands — was sighted on the Agulhas Bank in 2004. It is not known from which population the sighted individual stems. The Kerguelen Islands are located and South America from the Agulhas Bank, but the west-ward direction of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current would force the dolphin to swim against the current from the Kerguelen Islands.\n\nFossil beaked whales have been recovered by trawling from the seafloor off South Africa. Stranded pygmy sperm whales have been recorded on both the east and west coasts of South Africa.\n\n"}

The musical climate of the time was dominated by Britpop and retro bands influenced by Oasis. Tiger, who were characterised by fuzzy guitars and multiple keyboards, were quickly held up as part of a new alternative.\n\nThe band had two keyboardists using synthesizers and used droning song structures similar to Stereolab and Neu!, but with a stronger pop element. The band were often criticised for their (lack of) fashion sense: they wore outdated clothes and at least two members of the band had mullet haircuts, which, although they became fashionable, were out of place at the time.\n\nThe band recorded and released their 1996 debut album \"We are Puppets\" less than a year after they first formed. The album's singles, \"Race\", \"My Puppet Pal\", and \"On The Rose\" were minor successes although only \"Race\" reached the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\"NME\" invited them to perform on their Brat Bus Tour in 1997.\n\nIn late 1998, they supported Pulp, but any impetus had been lost by this point and they were dropped from their record label shortly after.

{"id": "2193804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193804", "title": "Invention of the telephone", "text": "Invention of the telephone\n\nThe invention of the telephone was the culmination of work done by many individuals, and led to an array of lawsuits relating to the patent claims of several individuals and numerous companies.\n\nThe concept of the telephone dates back to the string telephone or lover's telephone that has been known for centuries, comprising two diaphragms connected by a taut string or wire. Sound waves are carried as mechanical vibrations along the string or wire from one diaphragm to the other. The classic example is the tin can telephone, a children's toy made by connecting the two ends of a string to the bottoms of two metal cans, paper cups or similar items. The essential idea of this toy was that a diaphragm can collect voice sounds from the voice sounds for reproduction at a distance. One precursor to the development of the electromagnetic telephone originated in 1833 when Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Eduard Weber invented an electromagnetic device for the transmission of telegraphic signals at the University of Göttingen, in Lower Saxony, helping to create the fundamental basis for the technology that was later used in similar telecommunication devices. Gauss's and Weber's invention is purported to be the world's first electromagnetic telegraph.\n\nIn 1840, American Charles Grafton Page passed an electric current through a coil of wire placed between the poles of a horseshoe magnet. He observed that connecting and disconnecting the current caused a ringing sound in the magnet. He called this effect \"galvanic music\".\n\nInnocenzo Manzetti considered the idea of a telephone as early as 1844, and may have made one in 1864, as an enhancement to an automaton built by him in 1849.\n\nCharles Bourseul was a French telegraph engineer who proposed (but did not build) the first design of a \"make-and-break\" telephone in 1854. That is about the same time that Meucci later claimed to have created his first attempt at the telephone in Italy.\n\nBourseul explained: \"Suppose that a man speaks near a movable disc sufficiently flexible to lose none of the vibrations of the voice; that this disc alternately makes and breaks the currents from a battery: you may have at a distance another disc which will simultaneously execute the same vibrations... It is certain that, in a more or less distant future, a speech will be transmitted by electricity. I have made experiments in this direction; they are delicate and demand time and patience, but the approximations obtained promise a favorable result.\"\n\nThe Reis telephone was developed from 1857 on. Allegedly, the transmitter was difficult to operate, since the relative position of the needle and the contact were critical to the device's operation. Thus, it can be called a \"telephone\", since it did transmit voice sounds electrically over distance, but was hardly a commercially practical telephone in the modern sense.\n\nThomas Edison tested the Reis equipment and found that \"single words, uttered as in reading, speaking and the like, were perceptible indistinctly, notwithstanding here also the inflections of the voice, the modulations of interrogation, wonder, command, etc., attained distinct expression.\"\n\nIn 1874, the Reis device was tested by the British company Standard Telephones and Cables (STC). The results also confirmed it could transmit and receive speech with good quality (fidelity), but relatively low intensity. At the time STC was bidding Bell's American Telephone and Telegraph Company, and the results were covered up by STC's chairman Sir Frank Gill to maintain Bell's reputation.\n\nAn early voice communicating device was invented around 1854 by Antonio Meucci, who called it a \"telettrofono\". In 1871 Meucci filed a caveat at the US Patent Office. His caveat describes his invention, but does not mention a diaphragm, electromagnet, conversion of sound into electrical waves, conversion of electrical waves into sound, or other essential features of an electromagnetic telephone.\n\nThe first American demonstration of Meucci's invention took place in Staten Island, New York in 1854. In 1861, a description of it was reportedly published in an Italian-language New York newspaper, although no known copy of that newspaper issue or article has survived to the present day. Meucci claimed to have invented a paired electromagnetic transmitter and receiver, where the motion of a diaphragm modulated a signal in a coil by moving an electromagnet, although this was not mentioned in his 1871 U.S. patent caveat. A further discrepancy observed was that the device described in the 1871 caveat employed only a single conduction wire, with the telephone's transmitter-receivers being insulated from a 'ground return' path.\n\nIn the 1880s Meucci was credited with the early invention of inductive loading of telephone wires to increase long-distance signals. Unfortunately, serious burns from an accident, a lack of English, and poor business abilities resulted in Meucci's failing to develop his inventions commercially in America. Meucci demonstrated some sort of instrument in 1849 in Havana, Cuba, however, this may have been a variant of a string telephone that used wire. Meucci has been further credited with the invention of an anti-sidetone circuit. However, examination showed that his solution to sidetone was to maintain two separate telephone circuits and thus use twice as many transmission wires. The anti-sidetone circuit later introduced by Bell Telephone instead canceled sidetone through a feedback process.\n\nAn American District Telegraph (ADT) laboratory reportedly lost some of Meucci's working models, his wife reportedly disposed of others and Meucci, who sometimes lived on public assistance, chose not to renew his 1871 \"teletrofono\" patent caveat after 1874.\n\nA resolution was passed by the United States House of Representatives in 2002 that said Meucci did pioneering work on the development of the telephone. The resolution said that \"if Meucci had been able to pay the $10 fee to maintain the caveat after 1874, no patent could have been issued to Bell.\"\n\nThe Meucci resolution by the US Congress was promptly followed by a Canada legislative motion by Canada's 37th Parliament, declaring Alexander Graham Bell as the inventor of the telephone. Others in Canada disagreed with the Congressional resolution, some of whom provided criticisms of both its accuracy and intent.\n\nA retired director general of the Telecom Italia central telecommunications research institute (CSELT), Basilio Catania, and the Italian Society of Electrotechnics, \"Federazione Italiana di Elettrotecnica\", have devoted a Museum to Antonio Meucci, constructing a chronology of his invention of the telephone and tracing the history of the two legal trials involving Meucci and Alexander Graham Bell.\n\nThey claim that Meucci was the actual inventor of the telephone, and base their argument on reconstructed evidence. What follows, if not otherwise stated, is a summary of their historic reconstruction.\n\nThe above information was published in the \"Scientific American\" Supplement No. 520 of December 19, 1876, based on reconstructions produced in 1885, for which there was no contemporary pre-1875 evidence. Meucci's 1871 caveat did not mention any of the telephone features later credited to him by his lawyer, and which were published in that Scientific American Supplement, a major reason for the loss of the 'Bell v. Globe and Meucci' patent infringement court case, which was decided against Globe and Meucci. See Antonio Meucci – Patent caveat, for the full printed text of his 1871 teletrofono patent caveat.\n\nCyrille Duquet invents the handset.\n\nElisha Gray, of Highland Park, Illinois, also devised a tone telegraph of this kind about the same time as La Cour. In Gray's tone telegraph, several vibrating steel reeds tuned to different frequencies interrupted the current, which at the other end of the line passed through electromagnets and vibrated matching tuned steel reeds near the electromagnet poles. Gray's 'harmonic telegraph,' with vibrating reeds, was used by the Western Union Telegraph Company. Since more than one set of vibration frequencies – that is to say, more than one musical tone – can be sent over the same wire simultaneously, the harmonic telegraph can be utilized as a 'multiplex' or many-ply telegraph, conveying several messages through the same wire at the same time. Each message can either be read by an operator by the sound, or from different tones read by different operators, or a permanent record can be made by the marks drawn on a ribbon of traveling paper by a Morse recorder. On July 27, 1875, Gray was granted U.S. patent 166,096 for \"Electric Telegraph for Transmitting Musical Tones\" (the harmonic)\n\nOn February 14, 1876, at the US Patent Office, Gray's lawyer filed a patent caveat for a telephone on the very same day that Bell's lawyer filed Bell's patent application for a telephone. The water transmitter described in Gray's caveat was strikingly similar to the experimental telephone transmitter tested by Bell on March 10, 1876, a fact which raised questions about whether Bell (who knew of Gray) was inspired by Gray's design or vice versa. Although Bell did not use Gray's water transmitter in later telephones, evidence suggests that Bell's lawyers may have obtained an unfair advantage over Gray.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell had pioneered a system called visible speech, developed by his father, to teach deaf children. In 1872 Bell founded a school in Boston to train teachers of the deaf. The school subsequently became part of Boston University, where Bell was appointed professor of vocal physiology in 1873.\n\nAs Professor of Vocal Physiology at Boston University, Bell was engaged in training teachers in the art of instructing the deaf how to speak and experimented with the Leon Scott phonautograph in recording the vibrations of speech. This apparatus consists essentially of a thin membrane vibrated by the voice and carrying a light-weight stylus, which traces an undulatory line on a plate of smoked glass. The line is a graphic representation of the vibrations of the membrane and the waves of sound in the air.\n\nThis background prepared Bell for work with spoken sound waves and electricity. He began his experiments in 1873–1874 with a harmonic telegraph, following the examples of Bourseul, Reis, and Gray. Bell's designs employed various on-off-on-off make-break current-interrupters driven by vibrating steel reeds which sent interrupted current to a distant receiver electro-magnet that caused a second steel reed or tuning fork to vibrate.\n\nDuring a June 2, 1875, experiment by Bell and his assistant Thomas Watson, a receiver reed failed to respond to the intermittent current supplied by an electric battery. Bell told Watson, who was at the other end of the line, to pluck the reed, thinking it had stuck to the pole of the magnet. Watson complied, and to his astonishment Bell heard a reed at his end of the line vibrate and emit the same timbre of a plucked reed, although there were no interrupted on-off-on-off currents from a transmitter to make it vibrate. A few more experiments soon showed that his receiver reed had been set in vibration by the magneto-electric currents induced in the line by the motion of the distant receiver reed in the neighborhood of its magnet. The battery current was not causing the vibration but was needed only to supply the magnetic field in which the reeds vibrated. Moreover, when Bell heard the rich overtones of the plucked reed, it occurred to him that since the circuit was never broken, all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into undulating (modulated) currents, which in turn would reproduce the complex timbre, amplitude, and frequencies of speech at a distance.\n\nAfter Bell and Watson discovered on June 2, 1875, that movements of the reed alone in a magnetic field could reproduce the frequencies and timbre of spoken sound waves, Bell reasoned by analogy with the mechanical phonautograph that a skin diaphragm would reproduce sounds like the human ear when connected to a steel or iron reed or hinged armature. On July 1, 1875, he instructed Watson to build a receiver consisting of a stretched diaphragm or drum of goldbeater's skin with an armature of magnetized iron attached to its middle, and free to vibrate in front of the pole of an electromagnet in circuit with the line. A second membrane-device was built for use as a transmitter. This was the \"gallows\" phone. A few days later they were tried together, one at each end of the line, which ran from a room in the inventor's house, located at 5 Exeter Place in Boston, to the cellar underneath. Bell, in the work room, held one instrument in his hands, while Watson in the cellar listened at the other. Bell spoke into his instrument, \"Do you understand what I say?\" and Watson answered \"Yes\". However, the voice sounds were not distinct and the armature tended to stick to the electromagnet pole and tear the membrane.\n\nIn a March 10, 1876, test, between two rooms in a single building in Boston showed that the telephone worked, but so far, only at a short range.\n\nIn 1876, Bell became the first to obtain a patent for an \"apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically\", after experimenting with many primitive sound transmitters and receivers. Because of illness and other commitments, Bell made little or no telephone improvements or experiments for eight months until after his U.S. patent 174,465 was published., but within a year the first telephone exchange was built in Connecticut and the Bell Telephone Company was created in 1877, with Bell the owner of a third of the shares, quickly making him a wealthy man.\nIn 1880, Bell was awarded the French Volta Prize for his invention and with the money, founded the Volta Laboratory in Washington, where he continued experiments in communication, in medical research, and in techniques for teaching speech to the deaf, working with Helen Keller among others. In 1885 he acquired land in Nova Scotia and established a summer home there where he continued experiments, particularly in the field of aviation.\n\nBell himself claimed that the telephone was invented in Canada but made in the United States.\n\nThe first successful bi-directional transmission of clear speech by Bell and Watson was made on March 10, 1876, when Bell spoke into the device, \"Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you.\" and Watson complied with the request. Bell tested Gray's liquid transmitter design in this experiment, but only after Bell's patent was granted and only as a proof of concept scientific experiment to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible \"articulate speech\" (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted. Because a liquid transmitter was not practical for commercial products, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone after March 1876 and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.\n\nBell's telephone transmitter (microphone) consisted of a double electromagnet, in front of which a membrane, stretched on a ring, carried an oblong piece of soft iron cemented to its middle. A funnel-shaped mouthpiece directed the voice sounds upon the membrane, and as it vibrated, the soft iron \"armature\" induced corresponding currents in the coils of the electromagnet. These currents, after traversing the wire, passed through the receiver which consisted of an electromagnet in a tubular metal can having one end partially closed by a thin circular disc of soft iron. When the undulatory current passed through the coil of this electromagnet, the disc vibrated, thereby creating sound waves in the air.\n\nThis primitive telephone was rapidly improved. The double electromagnet was replaced by a single permanently magnetized bar magnet having a small coil or bobbin of fine wire surrounding one pole, in front of which a thin disc of iron was fixed in a circular mouthpiece. The disc served as a combined diaphragm and armature. On speaking into the mouthpiece, the iron diaphragm vibrated with the voice in the magnetic field of the bar-magnet pole, and thereby caused undulatory currents in the coil. These currents, after traveling through the wire to the distant receiver, were received in an identical apparatus. This design was patented by Bell on January 30, 1877. The sounds were weak and could only be heard when the ear was close to the earphone/mouthpiece, but they were distinct.\n\nIn the third of his tests in Southern Ontario, on August 10, 1876, Bell made a call via the telegraph line from the family homestead in Brantford, Ontario, to his assistant located in Paris, Ontario, some 13 kilometers miles away. This test was claimed by many sources as the world's first long-distance call. The final test certainly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.\n\nBell exhibited a working telephone at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in June 1876, where it attracted the attention of Brazilian emperor Pedro II plus the physicist and engineer Sir William Thomson (who would later be ennobled as the 1st Baron Kelvin). In August 1876 at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Thomson revealed the telephone to the European public. In describing his visit to the Philadelphia Exhibition, Thomson said, \"I heard [through the telephone] passages taken at random from the New York newspapers: 'S.S. Cox Has Arrived' (I failed to make out the S.S. Cox); 'The City of New York', 'Senator Morton', 'The Senate Has Resolved To Print A Thousand Extra Copies', 'The Americans In London Have Resolved To Celebrate The Coming Fourth Of July!' All this my own ears heard spoken to me with unmistakable distinctness by the then circular disc armature of just such another little electro-magnet as this I hold in my hand.\"\n\nOnly a few months after receiving U.S. Patent No. 174465 at the beginning of March 1876, Bell conducted three important tests of his new invention and the telephone technology after returning to his parents' home at Melville House (now the Bell Homestead National Historic Site) for the summer. \n\nOn March 10, 1876 Bell had used \"the instrument\" in Boston to call Thomas Watson who was in another room but out of earshot. He said, \"Mr. Watson, come here – I want to see you\" and Watson soon appeared at his side.\n\nIn the first test call at a longer distance in Southern Ontario, on August 3, 1876, Alexander Graham's uncle, Professor David Charles Bell, spoke to him from the Brantford telegraph office, reciting lines from Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" (\"\"To be or not to be...\"\"). The young inventor, positioned at the A. Wallis Ellis store in the neighboring community of Mount Pleasant, received and may possibly have transferred his uncle's voice onto a phonautogram, a drawing made on a pen-like recording device that could produce the shapes of sound waves as waveforms onto smoked glass or other media by tracing their vibrations.\n\nThe next day on August 4 another call was made between Brantford's telegraph office and Melville House, where a large dinner party exchanged \"...speech, recitations, songs and instrumental music\". To bring telephone signals to Melville House, Alexander Graham audaciously \"bought up\" and \"cleaned up\" the complete supply of stovepipe wire in Brantford. With the help of two of his parents' neighbours, he tacked the stovepipe wire some 400 metres (a quarter mile) along the top of fence posts from his parents' home to a junction point on the telegraph line to the neighbouring community of Mount Pleasant, which joined it to the Dominion Telegraph office in Brantford, Ontario.\n\nThe third and most important test was the world's first true long-distance telephone call, placed between Brantford and Paris, Ontario on August 10, 1876. For that long-distance call Alexander Graham Bell set up a telephone using telegraph lines at Robert White's Boot and Shoe Store at 90 Grand River Street North in Paris via its Dominion Telegraph Co. office on Colborne Street. The normal telegraph line between Paris and Brantford was not quite 13 km (8 miles) long, but the connection was extended a further 93 km (58 miles) to Toronto to allow the use of a battery in its telegraph office. Granted, this was a one-way long-distance call. The first two-way (reciprocal) conversation over a line occurred between Cambridge and Boston (roughly 2.5 miles) on October 9, 1876. During that conversation, Bell was on Kilby Street in Boston and Watson was at the offices of the Walworth Manufacturing Company.\n\n\"Scientific American\" described the three test calls in their September 9, 1876, article, \"The Human Voice Transmitted by Telegraph\". Historian Thomas Costain referred to the calls as \"the three great tests of the telephone\". One Bell Homestead reviewer wrote of them, \"No one involved in these early calls could possibly have understood the future impact of these communication firsts\".\n\nA later telephone design was publicly exhibited on May 4, 1877, at a lecture given by Professor Bell in the Boston Music Hall. According to a report quoted by John Munro in \"Heroes of the Telegraph\":\nGoing to the small telephone box with its slender wire attachments, Mr. Bell coolly asked, as though addressing someone in an adjoining room, \"Mr. Watson, are you ready!\" Mr. Watson, five miles away in Somerville, promptly answered in the affirmative, and soon was heard a voice singing \"America\". [...] Going to another instrument, connected by wire with Providence, forty-three miles distant, Mr. Bell listened a moment, and said, \"Signor Brignolli, who is assisting at a concert in Providence Music Hall, will now sing for us.\" In a moment the cadence of the tenor's voice rose and fell, the sound being faint, sometimes lost, and then again audible. Later, a cornet solo played in Somerville was very distinctly heard. Still later, a three-part song came over the wire from Somerville, and Mr. Bell told his audience \"I will switch off the song from one part of the room to another so that all can hear.\" At a subsequent lecture in Salem, Massachusetts, communication was established with Boston, eighteen miles distant, and Mr. Watson at the latter place sang \"Auld Lang Syne\", the National Anthem, and \"Hail Columbia\", while the audience at Salem joined in the chorus.\"\nOn January 14, 1878, at Osborne House, on the Isle of Wight, Bell demonstrated the device to Queen Victoria, placing calls to Cowes, Southampton and London. These were the first publicly witnessed long-distance telephone calls in the UK. The queen considered the process to be \"quite extraordinary\" although the sound was \"quite faint\". She later asked to buy the equipment that was used, but Bell offered to make a model specifically for her.\n\nBell did for the telephone what Henry Ford did for the automobile. Although not the first to experiment with telephonic devices, Bell and the companies founded in his name were the first to develop commercially practical telephones around which a successful business could be built and grow. Bell adopted carbon transmitters similar to Edison's transmitters and adapted telephone exchanges and switching plug boards developed for telegraphy. Watson and other Bell engineers invented numerous other improvements to telephony. Bell succeeded where others failed to assemble a commercially viable telephone system. It can be argued that Bell invented the telephone industry. Bell's first intelligible voice transmission over an electric wire was named an IEEE Milestone.\n\nElisha Gray recognized the lack of fidelity of the make-break transmitter of Reis and Bourseul and reasoned by analogy with the lover's telegraph, that if the current could be made to more closely model the movements of the diaphragm, rather than simply opening and closing the circuit, greater fidelity might be achieved. Gray filed a patent caveat with the US patent office on February 14, 1876, for a liquid microphone. The device used a metal needle or rod that was placed – just barely – into a liquid conductor, such as a water/acid mixture. In response to the diaphragm's vibrations, the needle dipped more or less into the liquid, varying the electrical resistance and thus the current passing through the device and on to the receiver. Gray did not convert his caveat into a patent application until after the caveat had expired and hence left the field open to Bell.\n\nWhen Gray applied for a patent for the variable resistance telephone transmitter, the Patent Office determined \"while Gray was undoubtedly the first to conceive of and disclose the (variable resistance) invention, as in his caveat of 14 February 1876, his failure to take any action amounting to completion until others had demonstrated the utility of the invention deprives him of the right to have it considered.\"\n\nThe carbon microphone was independently developed around 1878 by David Edward Hughes in England and Emile Berliner and Thomas Edison in the US. Although Edison was awarded the first patent in mid-1877, Hughes had demonstrated his working device in front of many witnesses some years earlier, and most historians credit him with its invention.\n\nThomas Alva Edison took the next step in improving the telephone with his invention in 1878 of the carbon grain \"transmitter\" (microphone) that provided a strong voice signal on the transmitting circuit that made long-distance calls practical. Edison discovered that carbon grains, squeezed between two metal plates, had a variable electrical resistance that was related to the pressure. Thus, the grains could vary their resistance as the plates moved in response to sound waves, and reproduce sound with good fidelity, without the weak signals associated with electromagnetic transmitters.\n\nThe carbon microphone was further improved by Emile Berliner, Francis Blake, David E. Hughes, Henry Hunnings, and Anthony White. The carbon microphone remained standard in telephony until the 1980s, and is still being produced.\n\nAdditional inventions such as the call bell, central telephone exchange, common battery, ring tone, amplification, trunk lines, and wireless phones – at first cordless and then fully mobile – made the telephone the useful and widespread apparatus as it is now.\n\nThe telephone exchange was an idea of the Hungarian engineer Tivadar Puskás (1844–1893) in 1876, while he was working for Thomas Edison on a telegraph exchange. Puskás was working on his idea for an electrical telegraph exchange when Alexander Graham Bell received the first patent for the telephone. This caused Puskás to take a fresh look at his own work and he refocused on perfecting a design for a telephone exchange. He then got in touch with the U.S. inventor Thomas Edison who liked the design. According to Edison, \"Tivadar Puskas was the first person to suggest the idea of a telephone exchange\".\n\nBell has been widely recognized as the \"inventor\" of the telephone outside of Italy, where Meucci was championed as its inventor. In the United States, there are numerous reflections of Bell as a North American icon for inventing the telephone, and the matter was for a long time non-controversial. In June 2002, however, the United States House of Representatives passed a symbolic bill recognizing the contributions of Antonio Meucci \"\"in the invention of the telephone\"\" (not \"\"for the invention of the telephone\"\"), throwing the matter into some controversy. Ten days later the Canadian parliament countered with a symbolic motion conferring official recognition for the invention of the telephone to Bell.\n\nChampions of Meucci, Manzetti, and Gray have each offered fairly precise tales of a contrivance whereby Bell actively stole the invention of the telephone from their specific inventor. In the 2002 congressional resolution, it was inaccurately noted that Bell worked in a laboratory in which Meucci's materials had been stored, and claimed that Bell must thus have had access to those materials. Manzetti claimed that Bell visited him and examined his device in 1865. And it is alleged that Bell bribed a patent examiner, Zenas Wilber, not only into processing his application before Gray's, but allowing a look at his rival's designs before final submission.\n\nOne of the valuable claims in Bell's 1876 was claim 4, a method of producing variable electric current in a circuit by varying the resistance in the circuit. That feature was not shown in any of Bell's patent drawings, but was shown in Elisha Gray's drawings in his caveat filed the same day, February 14, 1876. A description of the variable resistance feature, consisting of seven sentences, was inserted into Bell's application. That it was inserted is not disputed. But when it was inserted is a controversial issue. Bell testified that he wrote the sentences containing the variable resistance feature before January 18, 1876, \"almost at the last moment\" before sending his draft application to his lawyers. A book by Evenson argues that the seven sentences and claim 4 were inserted, without Bell's knowledge, just before Bell's application was hand carried to the Patent Office by one of Bell's lawyers on February 14, 1876.\n\nContrary to the popular story, Gray's caveat was taken to the US Patent Office a few hours before Bell's application. Gray's caveat was taken to the Patent Office in the morning of February 14, 1876, shortly after the Patent Office opened and remained near the bottom of the in-basket until that afternoon. Bell's application was filed shortly before noon on February 14 by Bell's lawyer who requested that the filing fee be entered immediately onto the cash receipts blotter and Bell's application was taken to the Examiner immediately. Late in the afternoon, Gray's caveat was entered on the cash blotter and was not taken to the Examiner until the following day. The fact that Bell's filing fee was recorded earlier than Gray's led to the myth that Bell had arrived at the Patent Office earlier. Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not know this happened until later. Gray later abandoned his caveat and did not contest Bell's priority. That opened the door to Bell being granted US patent 174465 for the telephone on March 7, 1876.\n\nIn 1906 the citizens of the City of Brantford, Ontario, Canada and its surrounding area formed the Bell Memorial Association to commemorate the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in July 1874 at his parents’ home, Melville House, near Brantford. Walter Allward's design was the unanimous choice from among 10 submitted models, winning the competition. The memorial was originally to be completed by 1912 but Allward did not finish it until five years later. The Governor General of Canada, Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire, ceremoniously unveiled the memorial on October 24, 1917.\n\nAllward designed the monument to symbolize the telephone's ability to overcome distances. A series of steps lead to the main section where the floating allegorical figure of \"Inspiration\" appears over a reclining male figure representing \"Man, discovering his power to transmit sound through space\", and also pointing to three floating figures, the messengers of \"Knowledge\", \"Joy\", and \"Sorrow\" positioned at the other end of the tableau. Additionally, there are two female figures mounted on granite pedestals representing \"Humanity\" positioned to the left and right of the memorial, one sending and the other receiving a message.\n\nThe Bell Telephone Memorial's grandeur has been described as the finest example of Allward's early work, propelling the sculptor to fame. The memorial itself has been used as a central fixture for many civic events and remains an important part of Brantford's history, helping the city style itself as\" 'The Telephone City'.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

During the American Civil War, Baldwin believed his primary loyalty was to his state, and served as one of Virginia's representatives to the First and Second Confederate Congresses. He became one of the leading critics of President Jefferson Davis, who was seen by many as usurping the Confederacy's states' rights principles. During Congressional Reconstruction, Baldwin became Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nBaldwin was born on January 11, 1820 at Spring Farm near Staunton, Virginia to Virginia delegate and future Court of Appeals judge Briscoe Gerald Baldwin and his wife Martha Steele Brown Baldwin. He had three sisters--Frances Cornelia Baldwin Stuart (1815-1885), Mary Eleanor Baldwin Ranson (1817-1880) and Margaret E. Baldwin Stuart (1823-1844), as well as a brother, Briscoe Gerard Baldwin Jr. (1828-1898). J.B. Baldwin graduated from Staunton Academy and then the University of Virginia in 1838. He was a member of the college's Board of Visitors from 1856–64.\n\nHe married Susan Madison Peyton, daughter of lawyer John Howe Peyton, on July 4, 1852, and after her death married Ann Lewis.\n\nBaldwin read law under his father (who was elected to the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals in 1842) , then joined the law practice of his brother-in-law Alexander H. H. Stuart, although Baldwin ultimately established his own solo practice after becoming politically active.\n\nAt age 24, he substituted for his Whig law partner Alexander H.H. Stuart during a debate before the 1844 election. During the next election, local Augusta County voters elected Baldwin to the Virginia House of Delegates (a part time position), and he served from 1845-1846, but was defeated by Whig Hugh W. Sheffey after one term, and resumed his law practice full time (although remaining politically active).\n\nIn 1859, Baldwin narrowly missed election to the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, William J. Robertson of Charlottesville being elected instead by the legislators. During the Presidential Election of 1860, Baldwin canvassed for John Bell, the Constitutional Unionist candidate, who won in Virginia but drew far fewer electoral college votes than either Republican Abraham Lincoln or Democrat Stephen A. Douglas.\n\nAugusta County voters elected Baldwin, his brother in law, law partner and fellow Unionist Alexander H.H. Stuart and Unionist Democrat George Baylor to the Virginia Secession Convention, which began on February 13, 1861. On March 21, Baldwin began a pro-Union speech which lasted three days. On April 4, 1861, Baldwin represented the Convention's Unionist leadership at a secret one-hour interview with President Abraham Lincoln at the White House. He went to Washington hopeful that an agreement might be reached that would preserve the peace and hold Virginia in the Union. However, he returned to Richmond empty-handed, after finding that he and Lincoln had talked past each other. President Lincoln also separately met with another Unionist, John Minor Botts, who later blamed Baldwin for failing to publicize Lincoln's peace offer. The Unionists had temporarily managed to avoid secession while Baldwin met with Lincoln, but their majority collapsed shortly after his return to Richmond.\n\nWhen the Convention decided upon secession, Baldwin's loyalty remained with his home state. He initially served as a militia colonel and inspector general of Virginia State Troops, accepting a commission on April 23, 1861. Initially a colonel of the 52nd Virginia Infantry, Baldwin resigned on May 1, 1862 because of ill health, becoming instead colonel of the Augusta Reserves regiment.\n\nBy year's end, Baldwin was elected as a representative from Augusta County, to the First Confederate Congress. He was later elected to the Second Confederate Congress (defeating incumbent Governor John Letcher) and served until the conclusion of the Civil War. He became one of Confederate President Jefferson Davis's most vocal critics. \n\nFollowing the war, Baldwin returned home and resumed his legal practice. After giving his loyalty oath to the federal government, he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates under the post-war military provost in 1865-1867. On February 10, 1866, Baldwin testified before the Joint Committee on Reconstruction that Virginians would limit political rights granted to African Americans, which helped prompt Congressional Reconstruction. After Virginia's readmission to the Union, Baldwin continued representing Augusta County in the General Assembly. Fellow delegates chose him as their Speaker, and he served as such from 1865-1869. In this capacity, he drafted the procedural rules still in use in Virginia, known as \"Baldwin's Rules.\" \n\nWhen the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868 proposed to restrict former Confederates from holding further offices, which went beyond the terms of surrender at Appomattox Court House and caused considerable controversy within the Commonwealth, Baldwin joined with his brother-in-law Alexander H. H. Stuart and the Committee of Nine and met with General Ulysses S. Grant. Newly elected President Grant also met with provisional governor Henry H. Wells and businessmen Gilbert C. Walker and Franklin Stearns, then gave General (Secretary of War) John M. Schofield (and his successor General Canby) orders to allow separate votes on those two controversial provisions (each of which lost) and the new state Constitution without them (that passed overwhelmingly).\n\nBaldwin died on September 30, 1873 after a brief illness, survived by wife Susan, his sisters Frances Cornelia Baldwin Stuart and Mary Eleanor Baldwin Ranson, and brother Briscoe Gerald Baldwin. Staunton's businesses closed on the day of his funeral and all the city's church bells tolled (although not a member of any church, Baldwin considered himself Christian). He was buried in Staunton's historic Thornrose Cemetery (within the Newtown Historic District).\n\n"}

He became a founding member of the first Belgian Communist Party in 1919. In November 1924 he created the journal \"Correspondance\", which published 26 pamphlets up to September 1925, in collaboration with Camille Goemans and Marcel Lecomte. In July 1925 he was expelled from the party. That same year Nougé met the French surrealists, Louis Aragon, André Breton and Paul Éluard, and together they signed the tract \"La Révolution d'abord et toujours\" (The Revolution First and Forever). In 1926 he made the acquaintance of Louis Scutenaire, and September of that year marked the drafting of the constitution of the Belgian Surrealist Group that comprised Nougé, Goemans, René Magritte, E. L. T. Mesens and André Souris.\n\nIn 1927 Nougé composed plagiarised examples of a grammar book of Clarisse Juranville, illustrated with five drawings by Magritte. In 1928 he founded the magazine \"Distances\" and wrote the poem catalogue of a fur trader that was illustrated by Magritte entitled \"Le catalogue Samuel\" (re-edited by Didier Devillez, Brussels, 1996). He also wrote the preface of a Magritte exhibition at the gallery \"L'époque\" (signed by his 'accomplices' Goemans, Mesens, Lecomte, Scutenaire and Souris) and delivered in January 1929 to Charleroi – a conference on the accompanying music to a concert conducted by Souris and an exhibition of Magritte (\"La conférence de Charleroi\", published in 1946). Between December 1929 and February 1930 Nougé created 19 photographs, unpublished until 1968, under the title \"Subversion des images\". These photographs have been displayed notably, and most recently, at the Edinburgh Art Festival 2009. In 1931 he wrote the preface to an exhibition which followed the return of Magritte to Brussels. Extracts from \"Images défendues\" were published in 1933 in issue number 5 of \"Surréalisme au service de la Révolution\". In 1934 Nougé co-signed \"L'action immédiate\" in \"Documents 34\", edited by Mesens. In 1935 \"Le Couteau dans la plaie\" ('The Knife in the Wound') was published and in 1936, \"René Magritte ou la révélation objective\" was published in \"Les Beaux-Arts\" in Brussels. In that same year, Nougé, along with Mesens, organised the exclusion of Souris from the group.\n\nNougé was mobilised in 1939 in Mérignac then Biarritz, during World War II, as a military nurse. In 1941 Nougé prefaced an exhibition, quickly closed by the occupying forces, of photographs by Raoul Ubac in Brussels \"L'expérience souveraine\" (The Sovereign Experience). In 1943 he published the complete text of \"René Magritte ou Les images défendues\". In January 1944, under the pseudonym of Paul Lecharantais, he prefaced a new exhibition of Magritte that was criticized by the collaborators of nazism. In 1945 Nougé participated in the exhibition \"Surréalisme\" organised by the Editions La Boétie de Bruxelles gallery. In 1946 he published \"La Conférence de Charleroi\" and, under the title \"Élémentaires\" a preface for the exhibition of Magritte \"Le Surréalisme en Plein Soleil\" (Surrealism in Full Sunlight) at the Dietrich gallery.\n\nPaul Nougé died in Brussels on 6 November 1967.\n\nA number of his poems have been translated into English by Robert Archambeau and Jean-Luc Garneau, and appear in the poetry magazine \"Samizdat\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Sirsa is the district headquarters, and is located on National Highway 10 and from the capital, Delhi.\n\nThe district is named after its headquarters, Sirsa. The name, Sirsa is derived from its ancient Sanskrit name \"Sairishaka\", which is mentioned in the Mahabharata, the Ashtadhyayi and the Divyavadana. In \"Mahabharata\", Sairishaka is described as being taken by Nakula in his conquest of the western quarter. It must have been a flourishing city in the 5th century B.C. as it has been mentioned by Panini.\n\nThere are a number of legends about the origin of the name of the town. Its ancient name was Sairishaka and from that it seems to have been corrupted to Sirsa. According to local tradition, an unknown king named Saras founded the town in the 7th century A.D. and built a fort. The material remains of an ancient fort can still be seen in the south-east of the present town. It is about 5 km in circumference. According to another tradition, the name has its origin from the sacred river Sarasvati which one flowed near it. During the medieval period, the town was known as Sarsuti. It has been mentioned as Sarsuti by a number of medieval historians. The derivation of name Sirsa, is also attributed to the abundance of siris trees (\"Albizia lebbeck\" (Benth)) in the neighborhood of Sirsa which seems quite plausible for it finds some corroboration also in Panini and his commentator. In the ancient period, Sirsa was also known as Sirsapattan.However some local still believes that name may be derived from famous Sarsai Nath whose temple is there in the city.\n\nIn 1819, the territory occupied by the present district was taken over by the British and it became part of the North Western district of the Delhi territory. In 1820, the North Western district was bifurcated into Northern and Western districts and this territory became part of Western district, which was later renamed Haryana district. In 1837, it was separated from Haryana district and merged with newly formed Bhattiana district. In 1858, Bhattiana district was transferred to Punjab Province and renamed Sirsa district. In 1884, Sirsa district was abolished, its two tehsils, Sirsa and Dabwali were merged to form Sirsa tehsil, which became part of Hissar district of Punjab Province. On 1 November 1966, it became part of newly formed state of Haryana. In 1968, Sirsa tehsil was again bifurcated to Sirsa and Dabwali tehsils. The present district was carved out on 1 September 1975 by amalgamating Sirsa and Dabwali tehsils of erstwhile Hissar district.\n\nIn 2006 the Ministry of Panchayati Raj named Sirsa one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640). It is one of the two districts in Haryana that used to receive funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF).\n\nThe district comprises five tehsils: Sirsa, \nDabwali, Rania, Kalanwali and Ellenabad. These tehsils are further sub-divided into 7 blocks: Baragudha, Dabwali, Ellenabad, Nathusary Chopta, Odhan, Rania and Sirsa.\n\nThere are 5 Vidhan Sabha constituencies in this district: Kalanwali, Dabwali, Rania, Sirsa and Ellenabad. All of these are part of Sirsa Lok Sabha constituency.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census Sirsa district has a population of 1,295,189, roughly equal to the nation of Mauritius or the US state of New Hampshire. This gives it a ranking of 378th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . As of the 2011 census, its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 15.99%, with a sex ratio of 897 females for every 1000 males and a literacy rate of 68.82%.\n\nAs of 2001, Hindi speakers for 66% and Punjabi speakers account for 33% of the population.\n\n\nList of villages in Sirsa District\n\n"}
{"id": "2193854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193854", "title": "Fin Tutuola", "text": "Fin Tutuola\n\nOdafin \"Fin\" Tutuola is a fictional character on the TV drama \"\", played by Ice-T. He is a sergeant with the New York Police Department's Special Victims Unit.\n\nTutuola was raised in the Harlem area of New York City and was six years old during the 1968 riots following the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination, making his birth year 1961 or 1962. When he was a child, he witnessed his mother being murdered by a business rival of his father, a petty criminal; 30 years later, while investigating an unrelated case, he inadvertently discovered that his mother's killer was himself murdered.\n\nAccording to the Season 11 episode \"Disabled\", Tutuola, while still in the police academy, was forced by circumstances to place his maternal grandfather, whom he credits for raising him, in a nursing home. His grandfather later died as a result of abuse from the staff. Tutuola later describes this action as \"the worst decision [he] ever made\", and says that in his grief, rage, and guilt, he repeatedly started fights with fellow officers \"for the hell of it\" and was almost kicked off the force until an academy instructor intervened and helped him salvage his career.\n\nTutuola was previously a US Army Ranger and served on two tours. His military background remains sketchy as he rarely speaks of it or only makes vague and indirect references to it; however, in season 10, he explicitly mentions serving on Operation Gothic Serpent in Somalia in order to connect with a military rape victim.\n\nTutuola has a son named Kwasi (nicknamed Ken) with his ex-wife Teresa Randall. Subsequent episodes reveal that he has a strained relationship with his family. As of \"Intersecting Lives\", he is due to be a grandfather, as that episode revealed that Ken and his husband are expecting a baby via surrogate. As of the Season 19 episode \"Mood\", his paternal grandfather Iggy is still alive and healthy at the age of 95, despite suffering from diabetes. At the start of the episode \"Send in the Clowns,\" Ken and his husband bring their infant son Jaden to the squadroom for a birthday party.\n\nTutuola is an avid fan of first-person shooter video games, and is a regular at an annual video game convention. On why he would play such games considering the nature of his job and his military background, he explains to his colleagues that he views these games as an escape from the grey areas he faces in his job, and that he finds solace in the \"black and white\" nature of these games in which he gets to hunt down and defeat a clearly defined \"bad guy\".\n\nA former narcotics detective, Tutuola joins the SVU squad in the season 2 premiere \"\", as a replacement for Monique Jeffries (Michelle Hurd). He is then paired with Det. John Munch (Richard Belzer).\n\nWhile in the Narcotics Division, Tutuola worked undercover regularly. He would often spend weeks or even months at a time in various alternate identities. He left Narcotics and transferred to SVU when his partner took a bullet that was meant for him.\n\nTutuola initially has a rocky relationship with his colleagues in SVU, especially with Munch and Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay). Unlike them, he views justice in a \"black and white\" manner and believes that all criminals should be punished, regardless of the circumstances under which they commit the crime. He also tries to separate his private and professional life as much as possible and keeps a tight rein on his emotions, refusing to talk about his problems or to admit that the grisly nature of his work often affects him. For example, it takes him nearly a year before he opens up to Munch about the death of his former partner, and he only reveals that he has a son in Season 3.\n\nThe following are the medals and service awards worn by Fin, as seen in \"Dolls\".\n\nOver the 18 seasons the character has been featured on the show, Tutuola has come to respect and trust his SVU colleagues, even though they often disagree over the best way to solve cases. An example is his partnership with Munch, that over 13 years grew from icy dislike to mutual respect and good-natured banter, often about politics, as Munch is politically left-wing and Tutuola is a Republican. After Munch is shot in the buttocks by a suspect during a trial, Tutuola surprises him in the hospital with his favorite fig milkshake. He and Benson are also close friends, and she relies on him as her \"second-in-command\" when she is promoted to Sergeant and, eventually, Lieutenant.\n\nTutuola is gravely wounded while attempting to stop a holdup at a bodega; after being released from the hospital, he spends little time recovering, instead throwing himself back into work finding a kidnapped victim and busting a methamphetamine lab. This episode introduces Tutuola's son Ken Randall (Ernest Waddell), a computer science student at Hudson University, from whom he is estranged; Tutuola was always working when Ken was a child, and by his own admission chose work over his family.\n\nWhile attempting to solve the murders of AIDS victims, Tutuola seeks assistance from Ken, who helps the SVU squad locate the hacker who fraudulently obtained a list of AIDS patients. In the course of the investigation, Tutuola learns that Ken himself is gay. Their relationship is tested again in the episode \"Venom\", when uniform cops find Ken digging up a city street and arrest him. Ken contacts Benson instead of his father and tells her he is digging up the street to look for a body of a dead woman. The investigation, which first focused on Ken, takes a new turn when DNA evidence shows that Ken's cousin Darius Parker (Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges) is not only the murderer but also Ken's older half-brother, who had been abandoned by his mother — Tutuola's ex-wife Teresa Randall (LisaGay Hamilton). The episode ends with Darius threatening to expose the entire family's secrets in court. Darius goes on trial for the murders and, true to his word, exposes the family's dirty laundry to the public. Teresa at first refuses to testify, forcing the judge to remand her into custody for contempt of court, but she eventually reveals that Darius is the product of incest. Darius is acquitted of all charges, but both Tutuola and Ken disown him.\n\nOver the years, Tutuola's relationship with his son has improved, with Tutuola calling Ken \"the bravest man I know\". When Ken's fiancé Alejandro (Miguel Govea) is assaulted in a hate crime, Tutuola takes charge of the investigation, and persuades Alejandro's homophobic father to accept Ken into his family.\n\nDuring an investigation of prisoner sexual abuse, both Tutuola and Benson go undercover to Sealview Correctional Facility, and he saves her from being raped by a guard.\n\nIn the Season 9 finale \"Cold\", Detective Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) suspects that Tutuola tipped off his temporary partner Chester Lake (Adam Beach), who is suspected of murder, before he and Benson could take Lake into custody. Stabler checks Tutuola's phones, infuriating him. Near the end of the episode, Stabler apologizes for not trusting him, but Tutuola dismisses his apology because he believes Stabler will still be the same \"rat-bastard\" tomorrow. Afterwards, he requests a transfer from the squad. However, three months later, Tutuola's transfer request had become bogged down in red tape, keeping him with SVU. As Captain Don Cragen (Dann Florek) explains it, the person in charge of transfer paperwork is a colleague of Tutuola's in the narcotics unit who holds a grudge because his ex-wife started calling Tutuola after their divorce. Hearing this, Tutuola resigns himself to the likelihood that his transfer will not be effected anytime soon. No further mention of Tutuola's transfer request is made after this point. Tutuola and Stabler mend their relationship somewhat, however. While they are never friendly, they do respect each other, and sympathize with each other over the dual burdens they both face from being police officers and fathers. When Stabler beats up pedophile Jake Berlin (Tom Noonan) for posting pictures of Stabler's daughter on his website, Tutuola covers for him and praises him for showing restraint; Tutuola says that, had Berlin posted pictures of his child, he would have killed him.\n\nAfter Munch retires from SVU, Tutuola is partnered with Detective Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish). They have a good working relationship, but it is tested when Rollins' gambling addiction begins to interfere with her work. When Rollins loses thousands of dollars at an underground casino, Tutuola gives her some money and tells her to get help, and he is the first to defend her when she becomes a suspect in a corruption case involving the casino. When he learns that she had been cooperating in a sting operation, he is hurt that she didn't tell him, and loses some respect for her. They repair their relationship, however, after she reveals that she had been raped in her native Atlanta, Georgia by her superior officer, Deputy Chief Charles Patton (Harry Hamlin), and he helps her bring Patton to justice.\n\nAfter Benson's promotion, Tutuola resists any attempt to become her formal second-in-command, leading her to embrace the appointment of Mike Dodds (Andy Karl) as her sergeant. Although relieved, Tutuola does remark to Benson that he feels somewhat static in the wake of the recent changes, including Benson's and Rollins' motherhood. While his subsequent attempts at dating and having a personal life don't go anywhere, Tutuola learns that Ken and Alejandro have decided to have a baby via a surrogate, and is pleased that he is going to be a grandfather.\n\nIn \"Making A Rapist\", DNA evidence exonerates Sean Roberts (Henry Thomas), a man Tutuola had arrested for rape in 2000. When the evidence of the rape and murder of the victim's daughter pointing to Roberts, ADA Rafael Barba (Raúl Esparza) accuses Tutuola of framing Roberts as revenge for tarnishing his arrest record. Roberts is later convicted after he confesses in court.\n\nIn the season 19 premiere \"Gone Fishin'\", he recruits some men from Cuba to kidnap fugitive serial rapist Byron Marks (Will Chase) and bring him to New York. Marks' attorney and Cuba's U.N. permanent mission representative accuse Tutuola of kidnapping Marks and violating extradition laws. When Benson demands an explanation, Tutuola says that he had encountered Marks by chance while vacationing in Cuba, a lie Benson sees through but chooses to accept. At the end of the episode, Marks is found guilty of rape and goes to prison.\n\nIn a deleted scene from \"Net Worth\", it is revealed that Tutuola passed his sergeant's exam and became an NYPD Sergeant alongside Benson, who is now a Captain. In \"Real Fake News\", he and Benson discuss him passing the exam, but he says he is waiting to be appointed. In \"Mama\", he receives his sergeant's orders to go to the 21st precinct, but manages to get transferred back to SVU.\n\nThe character's name is inspired by the Yoruba author Amos Tutuola. Information about Amos Tutuola, recounted in the introduction of one of his books, states that his grandfather was an odafin, the spiritual leader of a clan, and Tutuola was the given name of the author's father; Odafin literally means \"the establisher of laws\" or \"lawmaker\" in the Yoruba language of southwestern Nigeria. Tutuola means \"the gentle one\".\n\nWhen Ice-T asked \"Law & Order\" series producer Dick Wolf how the part was supposed to be performed, Wolf told him to simply do what Ice-T would do if he were a cop.\n\n"}

Her writing is characterized by an experimental style which questions hierarchical social structures from a feminist perspective. She is best known for her work written in response to the dictatorship of the 1970s in Argentina. Works such as \"Como en la guerra\" (1977), \"Cambio de armas\" (1982) and \"Cola de lagartija\" (1983) combine a powerful critique of dictatorship with an examination of patriarchal forms of social organization and the power structures which inhere in human sexuality and gender relationships.\n\nLuisa Valenzuela was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on November 26, 1938, to Pablo Franciso Valenzuela, a physician, and to writer Luisa Mercedes Levinson. At her mother's house various writers gathered such as Adolfo Bioy Casares, Jorge Luis Borges and Ernesto Sabato. Though she felt an interest in natural sciences from an early age, at 17 she began publishing in several newspapers, such as \"Atlántida\", \"El Hogar\" and \"Esto Es\", and worked for Radio Belgrano, as well. At 20, just barely married to Theodore Marjak, a French merchant marine, she moved to Paris where she worked for Radio Télévision Française, and met members of both the \"nouveau roman\" literary movement and \"Tel Quel\". She published her first fiction work entitled \"Clara\" (\"Hay que sonreír\"), whose main character would give its name to the title of the book of both English and French translations. In 1958, Luisa Valenzuela gave birth to her daughter Anna-Luisa. In 1961 she moved back to Argentina, where she worked as a journalist for \"La Nación\" and \"Crisis\" magazine. In 1965 she got divorced. During 1967 and 1968 she traveled throughout Bolivia, Peru and Brazil working for \"La Nación\".\n\nIn 1969 she obtained the Fulbright Scholarship to study at the University of Iowa where she wrote \"The Efficient Cat\" (\"El gato eficaz\"). Between 1972 and 1974 she lived in Mexico City, Paris and Barcelona, with a brief stay in New York, where she researched the expression of the marginal United States literature as a recipient of the scholarship awarded by Argentina's National Fund for the Arts (\"Fondo Nacional de las Artes\"). As a consequence of the National Reorganization Process, that partially censored her novel \"He Who Searches\" (\"Como en la guerra\") by removing a torture scene, she moved to the United States where she lived for ten years. There she published in 1982 her short fiction book \"Change of Guard\" (\"Cambio de armas\") and in 1983 \"The Lizard's Tail\" (\"Cola de lagartija\"), a novel about José López Rega, Minister of Social Welfare during María Estela Martínez's presidency that was supposed to be originally titled as \"Red Ant Sorcerer, Lord of Tacurú and Her Sister Estrella\" (\"El Brujo Hormiga Roja, Señor del Tacurú y su Hermana Estrella\").\n\nLuisa Valenzuela was a Resident Writer at the Center for Interamerican Relations at New York and Columbia University, where she taught writing workshops and seminars for ten years. She was a member of the New York Institute for the Humanities, at the Fund for Free Expression and member of the Freedom to Write Committee of the PEN American Center. In 1983 she was awarded the Guggenheim Scholarship. In 1989 she returned to Buenos Aires, where she finished her fiction works \"National Reality from Bed\" (\"Realidad nacional desde la cama\"), conceived initially as a play but finished as a novel and \"Black novel with Argentines\" (\"Novela negra con argentinos\") that originally was meant to bear the title of \"The Motive\" (\"El motivo\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Library of Congress, writer Luisa Valenzuela reads from her book \"Aquí pasan cosas raras\" \n\n\n"}

The neighborhood is gentrifying and attracting new families, empty-nesters, Atlantans opposed to long commutes; as well as diverse culture of first-time homebuyers, single professionals, artist and students due to its close proximity to other nearby intown neighborhoods, high walkability index, urban amenities and nearby bohemian hotspots on Carroll Street in the adjoined-at-the-hip also historic Cabbagetown neighborhood and in other surrounding communities.\n\nThe CRiSP - Cabbagetown/Reynoldstown Security Patrol was founded by a small group of concerned Cabbagetown residents who wanted to be proactive about fighting crime in their community and was later joined by residents of Reynoldstown. CRiSP provides additional police and private security presence in Reynoldstown and Cabbagetown, helping to make the communities safer and to improve the quality of life for residents and visitors.\n\nReynoldstown is bordered on the west by Pearl Street, across which is Cabbagetown and, south of Memorial Drive, Grant Park; on the east by Moreland Avenue and Edgewood; on the south by I-20, across which is the Ormewood Park neighborhood and an industrial area which is officially part of Grant Park; and on the north by the railroad line and Inman Park.\n\nReynoldstown lies in NPU N. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. Local landmarks include the Colgate Mattress Factory, Trees Atlanta headquarters and nursery, and the former Atlanta & West Point Railroad depot, which now houses a restaurant.\n\nReynoldstown is a community that was originally settled after the American Civil War by freed slaves who were employed by the railroad. Madison and Sarah Reynolds were among the first ex-slaves to move into the area, and it is believed that the neighborhood was named after them. Reynoldstown was annexed by the city of Atlanta in 1909 and celebrates its historic tie to freed slave roots and artistic expressions to empower residents with its annual Wheelbarrow Festival. The neighborhood continued to thrive and prosper until the 1950s when it was nearly 100% African-American populated, when the railroad industry began to decline. Reynoldstown began gentrifying in the 1990s, altering the demographic makeup of the neighborhood where today it is closer to a mix of 65% white and 35% African-American population composition. The neighborhood was listed as a Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.\n\nThe BeltLine bisects Reynoldstown north-south.

It was located in Mercer County, New Jersey, and was completely surrounded by the former Princeton Township, from which it was formed in 1894. As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough had a population of 12,307, reflecting a decline of 1,896 (-13.3%) from the 14,203 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 2,187 (+18.2%) from the 12,016 counted in the 1990 Census.\n\nThe Borough of Princeton was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 11, 1813, within portions of West Windsor Township (in what was then part of Middlesex County) and Montgomery Township (in Somerset County), and was reincorporated on November 27, 1822. The borough became part of the newly created Mercer County in 1838, and became a fully independent municipality circa 1894. Portions of territory were acquired from Princeton Township on January 4, 1928 and August 21, 1951. On November 8, 2011, voters in Princeton Borough voted to consolidate with Princeton Township.\n\nMorven, the former residence of the Governor of New Jersey, is at 55 Stockton Street in the former borough, while the current residence is Drumthwacket in the former township.\n\nPrinceton borough was located at (40.350461,-74.659371). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.843 square miles (4.774 km), all of which was land.\n\nThe Census Bureau's 2006-2010 American Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household income was $104,234 (with a margin of error of +/- $20,004) and the median family income was $148,295 (+/- $34,644).

The borough's unusually low median age and high concentration of 18- to 24-year-olds is influenced by Princeton University.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough was $67,346, and the median income for a family was $102,957. Males had a median income of $60,341 versus $52,900 for females. The per capita income for the borough was $27,292.

The government consisted of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising six council members, with all positions elected at large. A Mayor was elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consisted of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year.\n\nThe Mayor served as the borough's Chief Executive Officer and nominated appointees to various boards and commissions subject to approval of the Borough Council. The Mayor presided at the Borough Council meetings and voted in the case of a tie or a few other specific cases.\n\nThe Borough Council had administrative powers and was the policy-making body of the Borough. The Council had six members; two were elected each year and they served three-year terms. The Council approved appointments made by the Mayor.

In Princeton Borough 1,385 voted for, 902 voted against while in Princeton Township 3,542 voted for and 604 voted against. Proponents of the merger asserted that when the merger is completed the new municipality of Princeton will save $3.2 million as a result of some scaled-down services, including layoffs of 15 government workers, including 9 police officers (however, the measure itself does not mandate such layoffs). Opponents of the measure challenged the findings of the report, citing cost savings as unsubstantiated, and noted that voter representation would be reduced in a smaller government structure. The consolidation took effect on January 1, 2013. December 31, 2012 was the last day the Borough of Princeton existed as a municipality.\n\nThe Borough of Princeton was in the 12th Congressional district and was part of New Jersey's 16th state legislative district.

It is the sequel to the 1996 video game \"Formula 1\" and was based on the 1997 Formula One World Championship.\n\nThe game includes a Grand Prix mode, which was designed to be technical and realistic, and an arcade mode, which was aimed towards a broader audience.\n\n\"Formula 1 97\" supports two-player racing through a split screen.\n\n\"Formula 1 97\" was developed by Bizarre Creations and published by Psygnosis. It uses the same game engine as the original \"Formula 1\". Psygnosis contacted ITV Commentator Murray Walker and arranged a meeting with Bizarre Creations employees. Walker became impressed with development and signed an exclusive agreement with Psygnosis to record English-language commentary for a further two years.\n\n\"Formula 1 97\" was a best-seller in the UK. In August 1998, the game's PlayStation version received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 200,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nIGN gave a rating of 9.0 out of 10 stating the game is a \"significant jump\" from \"Formula 1\". It also received a rating of 7.9 from GameSpot, saying the game had \"sent PlayStation racing into a new era.\" However, this was the last Formula One game to be made by the Bizarre Creations team, who moved on to create the successful \"Metropolis Street Racer\" for the Dreamcast and \"Project Gotham Racing\" for the Xbox. \"Official UK PlayStation Magazine\" said it was a big improvement in every regard over the previous game, and that the \"graphics engine is faster, running at 25 fps, even with a dozen cars on the screen. The increased detail is most apparent in Grand Prix mode. All the cars are now fully deformable, and stray bits of debris stay on the track. Prepare to be stunned.\"\n\nThe game was hit by legal wranglings with the FIA (Formula One's governing body) objecting to the use of the FIA logo on the game's packaging. The game was withdrawn from shops six weeks after its release. It was re-released without the offending logo, but the FIA were still unhappy. However, the FIA lost the court case, and the game continued to be sold without the logo. Another problem faced was the use of the name and image of then-Williams-F1-driver Jacques Villeneuve, after he had copyrighted both. The game shows a silhouette for the driver's image. Murray Walker refers to him as \"Williams Numberone\" or \"The Canadian\", however on the game menu, they list him as Driverone Williams; this problem is easily sidestepped by the addition of a driver name edit function. The game also has unused voice clips for Jacques Villeneuve, that can be found via hacking methods. This idea proved popular and re-appeared in \"Formula 1 98\", but was not used for any of the following games. The driver name edit function is also used to enter codes to unlock the Aida, Adelaide, Silverstone (1960s look), a mirrored version of the original game's bonus track, and others, such as raining frogs and the cars having the ability to hover.\n\nAll alcohol and tobacco sponsors are censored, for example trackside adverts saying Faster instead of Fosters, since such advertisements were illegal in some parts of the U.S.\n"}

He was educated at Walworth Grammar School and was briefly apprenticed on a naval ship at age 10 but returned to school. He studied law and was articled to a solicitor but turned to acting by age 19.\n\nBuckstone first joined a travelling troupe in 1821 as Gabriel in \"The Children in the Wood\". and toured for three years, mostly in the southeast of England. He found a mentor in Edmund Kean. He made his first London appearance, on 30 January 1823, at the Surrey Theatre, as Ramsay in \"The Fortunes of Nigel\". In 1824 he joined that theatre and played Peter Smink in \"The Armistice\" with great success. He also began to write plays.\nHis successes led to his engagement in 1827 at the Adelphi Theatre, where he remained as the leading low comedian until 1833. Buckstone's acting was described as \"a union of shrewdness and drollery, with their interaction upon each other ... was irresistibly comic.\" Buckstone wrote most of his plays in the first half of his career, and many of these were produced at the Adelphi. As his acting career reached the height of its success, his playwriting output declined. At the Adelphi, he appeared as Bobby Trot in his first really successful play, the melodrama \"Luke the Labourer\" (1827), which he had written in 1826. Other well known plays were \"Wreck Ashore\" (1830) and \"Forgery\" (1832) Perhaps the most successful of these early plays was his 1833 play, \"The Bravo\", based on James Fenimore Cooper's novel of the same name.\n\nHe first appeared at the Haymarket Theatre during the summer season in 1833, also writing plays for this theatre, including \"Ellen Wartham\" (1833). Another hit for the Haymarket was the drama \"Thirty Years of a Woman's Life\". At that theatre, his acting was praised in \"The Housekeeper\" by Douglas Jerrold (1833), \"Pyramus and Thisbe\", and in his own plays, \"Uncle John\", \"Rural Felicity\" and \"Agnes de Vere\" (all in 1834). He stayed at the Haymarket until 1838, producing \"The Dream at Sea\" among other plays.\n\nIn 1839–40 he returned to the Adelphi to write and star in a number of plays, including his extraordinarily successful play \"Jack Sheppard\", based on the novel of the same name published that year by William Harrison Ainsworth. After his return from a visit to the United States in 1840, where he met with little success, Buckstone played in his own play, \"Married Life\", at the Haymarket. He then appeared at several London theatres, among them the Lyceum, where he was Box at the first representation of \"Box and Cox\", by John Maddison Morton, in 1847. There he also created the role of Bob, in Dion Boucicault's \"Old Heads and Young Hearts\", and played several other memorable roles, including, Slowboy in \"Cricket on the Hearth\", Dan in \"John Bull\", MacDunnum of Dunnum in \"A School for Scheming\", Scrub in \"The Beaux' Stratagem\" and Golightly in \"Lend Me Five Shillings\", and several Shakespeare roles. For the Adelphi, he wrote \"The Green Bushes\" and \"The Flowers of the Forest\", both in 1847. He also dramatised \"The Last Days of Pompeii\".\n\nHe returned to the Haymarket in 1848, writing and playing in \"An Alarming Sacrifice\", \"Leap Year\" and \"A Serious Family\". During this period, he memorably played Moses in Stirling Coyne's adaptation of \"The Vicar of Wakefield\", Appleface in Jerrold's \"Catspaw\", Shadowly Softhead in Lord Lytton's \"Not as Bad as We Seem\" and in many Shakespeare productions with Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean.\n\nHe became lessee of the Haymarket from 1853 to 1877. For this theatre, he continued to write plays and farces, though markedly fewer than before. As actor-manager of the Haymarket, he surrounded himself with an admirable and effective ensemble company, including Edward Askew Sothern, Henry Compton, Mr. and Mrs. Charles James Mathews and the Kendals. He produced the plays of James Planché, Thomas William Robertson, Tom Taylor, John Oxenford, H. J. Byron and W. S. Gilbert, as well as his own, and in most of these he acted. Buckstone's management made the Haymarket into the premier comedy theatre of the age. Buckstone's own gifts in comedy contributed much to the theatre's remarkable success. According to \"The Times\", \"Few men... have possessed to a greater extent the power of communicating the spirit of mirth to an audience. ... He was helped, too, in his vocation by remarkable physical attributes\" and a peculiar, hilarious voice.\n\nIn the 1850s, Buckstone produced \"An Unequal Match\" and Taylor's \"The Overland Route\", \"A Hero of Romance\" by Westland Marston, and \"Home\" by Robertson. In 1862, Buckstone produced a 496-night run of \"Our American Cousin\", with Sothern in his most famous role as Lord Dundreary. Robertson's \"David Garrick\" was a hit in 1864, also with Sothern in the title role. W. S. Gilbert premiered seven of his plays at the Haymarket during this time including his blank verse \"fairy comedies\" starring the Kendals, such as \"The Palace of Truth\" (1870), \"Pygmalion and Galatea\" (1871) and \"The Wicked World\" (1873). Buckstone also produced Gilbert's dramas, \"Charity\" (1874) and \"Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith\" (1876), as well as his 1877 farce \"Engaged\". In 1873 Buckstone introduced the innovation of matinées starting at 2.00 pm. By the mid-1870s, however, Buckstone's company was disbanding, and in 1877, ill and bankrupt after sustaining heavy losses, he gave up management of the theatre.\n\nBuckstone was first married in 1828 to Anne Maria Honeyman, with whom he had at least five children before she died in 1844. For many years, Buckstone was closely associated with the actress Fanny Copeland Fitzwilliam, who was widowed in 1852 and whom he was engaged to marry in 1854. She died of cholera a month before the wedding. In 1857 Buckstone married Fanny's cousin Isabella Copeland, the great-niece of the theatre manager Robert Copeland, and they had 12 children between 1857 and 1876. Their daughter, Lucy Isabella Buckstone and their sons John Copeland Buckstone and Rowland Buckstone also took to the stage.\n\nAfter three years of ill health, Buckstone died at his home in Lower Sydenham in 1879 at the age of 77 and was buried in Ladywell Cemetery.\n\nAccording to director Nigel Everett and stagehands at the Haymarket Theatre, Buckstone's ghost has often been seen at the theatre, particularly during comedies and \"when he appreciates things\" playing there. In 2009, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that the actor Patrick Stewart saw the ghost standing in the wings during a performance of \"Waiting for Godot\" at the Haymarket.\n\n"}

Lasting the whole day of 22 March 1849 and ending at dawn on 23 March, it resulted in a severe defeat and retreat of the Piedmontese (Sardinian) army.\n\nAn uneasy armistice made in 1848 between Austria and Sardinia lasted less than seven months, before Charles Albert, King of Sardinia, denounced the truce on 12 March 1849. The Austrian army took the military initiative in Lombardy. Under the command of Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky von Radetz, it seized the fortress town of Mortara.\n\nThe seizure of Mortara led to a battle between Austrian and Piedmontese troops at Novara, west of Milan. 70,000 Austrian troops, superior in numbers and armament to the 45,000 Piedmontese, thoroughly routed their opponent as they had at the Battle of Custoza the previous year. Piedmont also suffered from a lack of support from the smaller Italian states. General Girolamo Ramorino was accused of disobeying orders before the Battle of Novara, and, that same year, he was executed.\n\nThe Piedmontese were driven back to Borgomanero at the foot of the Alps, and the Austrian forces occupied Novara, Vercelli and Trino, with the road to the Piedmontese capital, Turin, lying open to them.\n\nAustrian general Baron Julius von Haynau subdued Brescia, 54 miles NE of Milan, and Charles Albert abdicated in favor of his son Victor Emmanuel, who would later become the first king of a unified Italy. Friedrich Engels wrote \"that, after this defeat, a revolution and proclamation of a republic in Turin is expected, arises from the fact that the attempt is being made to prevent it by the abdication of Charles Albert in favour of his eldest son.\" A Piedmontese Republic was not created, though a Roman Republic had already been proclaimed in February, and there existed a Venetian Republic as well. Charles Albert exiled himself to Oporto, Portugal, and died shortly thereafter.\n\nA peace treaty was signed on 9 August. Piedmont was forced to pay an indemnity of 65 million francs to Austria. A reenactment of the battle occurs every year. The Austrian frigate \"Novara\", which went on a round-the-world scientific expedition between 1857 and 1859, was named after this Austrian victory.\n\n"}

{"id": "2193890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193890", "title": "Thistle", "text": "Thistle\n\nThistle is the common name of a group of flowering plants characterised by leaves with sharp prickles on the margins, mostly in the family Asteraceae. Prickles can also occur all over the plant – on the stem and on the flat parts of the leaves. These prickles are an adaptation that protects the plant from being eaten by herbivores. Typically, an involucre with a clasping shape similar to a cup or urn subtends each of a thistle's flowerheads.\n\nThe comparative amount of spininess varies dramatically by species. For example, \"Cirsium heterophyllum\" has minimal spininess while \"Cirsium spinosissimum\" is the opposite. Typically, species adapted to dry environments have greater spininess.\n\nThe term thistle is sometimes taken to mean precisely those plants in the tribe Cardueae (synonym: Cynareae), especially the genera \"Carduus\", \"Cirsium\", and \"Onopordum\". However, plants outside this tribe are sometimes called thistles, and when this is done, \"thistles\" would form a polyphyletic group.\n\nA thistle is the floral emblem of Scotland and Lorraine, as well as the emblem of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\".\n\nBiennial thistles are particularly noteworthy for their high wildlife value, producing such things as copious floral resources for pollinators, nourishing seeds for birds like the goldfinch, foliage for butterfly larvae, and down for the lining of birds' nests.\n\nGenera in the Asteraceae with the word thistle often used in their common names include:\n\nPlants in families other than Asteraceae which are sometimes called thistle include:\n\nThistles, even if one restricts the term to members of the Asteraceae, are too varied a group for generalisation; many are troublesome weeds, including some invasive species of \"Cirsium\", \"Carduus\", \"Silybum\" and \"Onopordum\". Typical adverse effects are competition with crops and interference with grazing in pastures, where dense growths of spiny vegetation suppress forage plants and repel grazing animals from eating either the thistle plants or neighbouring forage. Some species, although not intensely poisonous, do affect the health of animals that swallow more than small amounts of the material.\n\nConversely however, the genus \"Cynara\" includes commercially important species of artichoke and some species regarded as major weeds are commercial sources of vegetable rennet used in commercial cheese making. Similarly, some species of \"Silybum\" that occur as weeds, also are cultivated for seeds that yield vegetable oil and pharmaceutical compounds such as Silibinin.\n\nOther thistles that nominally are weeds are important honey plants, both as bee fodder in general, and as sources of luxury monofloral honey products.\n\nThistle flowers are the favourite nectar sources of the pearl-bordered fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary, high brown fritillary, and dark green fritillary butterflies.\nThistles (and thistle-seed feeders) also provide important sustenance for goldfinches and are strongly favored by many butterflies besides fritillaries such as the monarch, skippers, and the tiger swallowtail. Additionally, hummingbirds will feed on the flowers of the biennial species (which feature large flowers, as compared with the perennial Canada thistle).\n\nSome thistles (for example \"Cirsium vulgare\", native to Eurasia), have been widely introduced outside their native range. Control measures include \"Trichosirocalus\" weevils, but a problem with this approach, at least in North America, is that the introduced weevils may affect native thistles at least as much as the desired targets.\n\nThistles have been said to be very important nectar sources for pollinators. Some ecological organizations, such as the Xerces Society, have attempted to raise awareness of their benefits, to counteract the general agricultural and home garden labeling of thistles as unwanted weeds. The monarch butterfly, \"Danaus plexippus\" for instance, was highlighted as traditionally relying upon taller large-flowered thistle species such as Tall thistle, \"Cirsium altissimum\", for its migration. Although such organizations focus on the benefits of native thistles, certain non-native thistles, such as \"Cirsium vulgare\" in North America, may provide similar benefits to wildlife. Some prairie and wildflower seed production companies supply bulk seed for native North American thistle species, for wildlife habitat restoration, although availability tends to be low. Thistles are particularly valued by bumblebees for their high nectar production. \"Cirsium vulgare\" ranked in the top 10 for nectar production in a UK plants survey conducted by the AgriLand project which is supported by the UK Insect Pollinators Initiative. Bull thistle was also a top producer of nectar sugar in another study in Britain, ranked third with a production per floral unit of (2323 ± 418μg).\n\nMaud Grieve recorded that Pliny and medieval writers had thought it could return hair to bald heads and that in the early modern period it had been believed to be a remedy for headaches, plague, canker sores, vertigo, and jaundice.\n\nAccording to legend, an invading Norse army was attempting to sneak up at night upon a Scottish army's encampment. During this operation one barefoot Norseman had the misfortune to step upon a thistle, causing him to cry out in pain, thus alerting Scots to the presence of the Norse invaders. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the 1263 Battle of Largs, which marked the beginning of the departure of King Haakon IV (Haakon the Elder) of Norway who, having control of the Northern Isles and Hebrides, had harried the coast of the Kingdom of Scotland for some years.\n\nThe thistle has been the national emblem of Scotland since the reign of King Alexander III (1249–1286). It is found in many Scottish symbols and was used on silver coins issued by King James III in 1474, the first coins to feature a thistle. In 1536, the bawbee, a sixpence in the pound Scots, was issued for the first time under King James V; it showed a crowned thistle. Thistles continued to appear regularly on Scottish and later British coinage until 2008, when a 5p coin design showing \"\"The Badge of Scotland, a thistle royally crowned\"\" ceased to be minted, though it remains in circulation. The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, the highest and oldest chivalric order of Scotland, has thistles on its insignia and a chapel in St Giles's Kirk, Edinburgh, dubbed the Thistle Chapel. The thistle is the main charge of the regimental badge of the Scots Guards, the oldest regiment in the British Army. Both the Order of the Thistle and the Scots Guards use the motto \"Nemo me impune lacessit\", the motto of the House of Stuart and referring to the thistle's prickly nature. Pound coins with this motto and a thistle were minted in 1984, 1989, and 2014. The combination of thistle and motto first appeared on the bawbee issued by King Charles II. In 1826 the grant of arms to the new National Bank of Scotland stipulates that the shield be surrounded by thistles and \"thistle\" is used as the name of several Scottish football clubs. Since 2013 a stylised thistle, crowned with the Scottish crown, has been the emblem of Police Scotland, and had long featured in the arms of seven of the eight pre-2013 Scottish police services and constabularies, the sole exception being the Northern Constabulary. As part of the arms of the University of Edinburgh, the thistle appears together with a saltire on one of the escutcheons of the Mercat Cross in Edinburgh. The coat of arms and crest of Nova Scotia - \"\"New Scotland\"\" - briefly Scotland's colony, has since the 17th century featured thistles.\nFollowing his ascent to the English throne, King James VI of Scotland & I of England used a badge consisting of a Tudor rose \"dimidiated\" with a Scottish thistle and surmounted by a royal crown. As the floral emblem of Scotland it appears in the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom thereafter, and was included in the heraldry of various British institutions, such as the Badge of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom alongside the Tudor rose, Northern Irish flax, and Welsh leek. This floral combination appears on the present issues of the one pound coin. Beside the Tudor rose and Irish shamrock the thistle appears on the badge of the Yeomen of the Guard and the arms of the Canada Company. Issues of the historical florin showed the same flora, later including a leek. The thistle is also used to symbolise connection with Scotland overseas. For example, in Canada, it is one of the four floral emblems on the flag of Montreal; in the US, Carnegie Mellon University features the thistle in its crest in honour of the Scottish heritage of its founder, Andrew Carnegie. The thistle is also the emblem of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", which originated in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nWhich species of thistle is referred to in the original legend is disputed. Popular modern usage favours cotton thistle (\"Onopordum acanthium\"), perhaps because of its more imposing appearance, though it is unlikely to have occurred in Scotland in medieval times; the spear thistle (\"Cirsium vulgare\"), an abundant native species in Scotland, is a more likely candidate. Other species, including dwarf thistle (\"Cirsium acaule\"), musk thistle (\"Carduus nutans\"), and melancholy thistle (\"Cirsium heterophyllum\") have also been suggested.\n\nThe thistle, and more precisely \"Onopordum acanthium\", is one of the symbols of Lorraine, together with its coat of arms which displays three avalerions, and the Cross of Lorraine.\n\nLorraine is a region located in northeastern France, along the border with Luxembourg and Germany. Before the French Revolution, a large part of the region formed the Duchy of Lorraine. In the Middle Ages, the thistle was an emblem of the Virgin Mary because its white sap would bring to mind the milk falling from the breast of the Mother of God. It was later adopted as a personal symbol by René of Anjou, together with the Cross of Lorraine, then known as the Cross of Anjou. It seems through his book \"Livre du cuer d'amours espris\" that the Duke chose the thistle as his emblem not only because it was a Christian symbol, but also because he associated it with physical love.\n\nThe thistle and the cross were used again by his grandson, René II, Duke of Lorraine, who introduced them in the region. The two symbols became hugely popular among the local people during the Battle of Nancy in 1477, during which the Lorrain army defeated Burgundy. The Duke's motto was \"\"Qui s'y frotte s'y pique\"\", meaning \"who touches it, pricks oneself\", with a similar idea to the Scottish motto \"\"Nemo me impune lacessit\"\". Nowadays the thistle is still the official symbol of the city of Nancy, as well as the emblem of the AS Nancy football team, and the Lorraine Regional Natural Park.\n\n\"Carduus\" is the Latin term for a thistle (hence cardoon, \"chardon\" in French), and \"Cardonnacum\" is the Latin word for a place with thistles. This is believed to be the origin of name of the Burgundy village of Chardonnay, Saône-et-Loire, which in turn is thought to be the home of the famous Chardonnay grape variety.\n"}
{"id": "2193894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193894", "title": "Islamic military jurisprudence", "text": "Islamic military jurisprudence\n\nIslamic military jurisprudence refers to what has been accepted in Sharia (Islamic law) and Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) by \"Ulama\" (Islamic scholars) as the correct Islamic manner, expected to be obeyed by Muslims, in times of war. Some scholars and Muslim religious figures describe armed struggle based on Islamic principles as the Lesser jihad.\n\nThe first military rulings were formulated during the first century after Muhammad established an Islamic state in Medina. These rulings evolved in accordance with the interpretations of the Qur'an (the Islamic Holy scriptures) and Hadith (the recorded traditions, actions (behaviors), sayings and consents of Muhammad). The key themes in these rulings were the justness of war (Harb), and the injunction to jihad. The rulings do not cover feuds and armed conflicts in general.\n\nJihad (Arabic for \"struggle\") was given a military dimension after the oppressive practices of the Meccan Quraish against Muslims. It was interpreted as the struggle in God's cause to be conducted by the Muslim community. Injunctions relating to jihad have been characterized as individual as well as collective duties of the Muslim community. Hence, the nature of attack is important in the interpretation—if the Muslim community as a whole is attacked jihad becomes incumbent on all Muslims. Jihad is differentiated further in respect to the requirements within Muslim-governed lands (Dar al-Islam) and non-Muslim lands (Dar al-Harb).\n\nAccording to Shaheen Sardar Ali and Javaid Rehman, both professors of law, the Islamic military jurisprudence are in line with rules of modern international law. They point to the dual commitment of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states (representing most of the Muslim world) to Islamic law and the United Nations Charter, as evidence of compatibility of both legal systems.\n\nFighting is justified for legitimate self-defense, to aid other Muslims and after a violation in the terms of a treaty, but should be stopped if these circumstances cease to exist. War should be conducted in a disciplined way, to avoid injuring non-combatants, with the minimum necessary force, without anger and with humane treatment towards prisoners of war.\n\nDuring his life, Muhammad gave various injunctions to his forces and adopted practices toward the conduct of war. The most important of these were summarized by Muhammad's companion and first Caliph, Abu Bakr, in the form of ten rules for the Muslim army:\n\nAccording to Tabari, the ten bits of \"advice\" that Abu Bakr gave was during the Expedition of Usama bin Zayd. During the Battle of Siffin, the Caliph Ali stated that Islam does not permit Muslims to stop the supply of water to their enemy. In addition to the Rashidun Caliphs, hadiths attributed to Muhammad himself suggest that he stated the following regarding the Muslim conquest of Egypt that eventually took place after his death:\n\nThese principles were upheld by 'Amr ibn al-'As during his conquest of Egypt. A Christian contemporary in the 7th century, John of Nikiû, stated the following regarding the conquest of Alexandria by 'Amr:\n\nThe principles established by the early Caliphs were also honoured during the Crusades, as exemplified by Sultans such as Saladin and Al-Kamil. For example, after Al-Kamil defeated the Franks during the Crusades, Oliverus Scholasticus praised the Islamic laws of war, commenting on how Al-Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food:\n\nThe early Islamic treatises on international law from the 9th century onwards covered the application of Islamic ethics, Islamic economic jurisprudence and Islamic military jurisprudence to international law, and were concerned with a number of modern international law topics, including the law of treaties; the treatment of diplomats, hostages, refugees and prisoners of war; the right of asylum; conduct on the battlefield; protection of women, children and non-combatant civilians; contracts across the lines of battle; the use of poisonous weapons; and devastation of enemy territory.\n\nMuslim jurists agree that Muslim armed forces must consist of debt-free adults who possess a sound mind and body. In addition, the combatants must not be conscripted, but rather enlist of their free will, and with the permission of their family.\n\nMuslims have struggled to differentiate between legitimate and illegitimate wars. Fighting in self-defense is not only legitimate but considered obligatory upon Muslims, according to the Qur'an. The Qur'an, however, says that should the enemy's hostile behavior cease, then the reason for engaging the enemy also lapses.\n\nAccording to the majority of jurists, the Qur'anic \"casus belli\" (justification of war) are restricted to aggression against Muslims and \"fitna\"—persecution of Muslims because of their religious belief. They hold that unbelief in itself is not the justification for war. These jurists therefore maintain that only combatants are to be fought; noncombatants such as women, children, clergy, the aged, the insane, farmers, serfs, the blind, and so on are not to be killed in war. Thus, the Hanafī Ibn Najīm states: \"the reason for jihād in our [the Hanafīs] view is \"kawnuhum harbā ‛alaynā\" [literally, their being at war against us].\" The Hanafī jurists al-Shaybānī and al-Sarakhsī state that \"although kufr [unbelief in God] is one of the greatest sins, it is between the individual and his God the Almighty and the punishment for this sin is to be postponed to the \"dār al-jazā’\", (the abode of reckoning, the Hereafter).\" War, according to the Hanafis, can't simply be made on the account of a nation's religion. Abdulaziz Sachedina argues that the original jihad according to his version of Shi'ism was permission to fight back against those who broke their pledges. Thus the Qur'an justified defensive jihad by allowing Muslims to fight back against hostile and dangerous forces.\n\nMuhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi`i (d. 820), founder of the Shafi'i school of thought, was the first to permit offensive jihad, limiting this warfare against pagan Arabs only, not permitting it against non-Arab non-Muslims. This view of al-Shafi'i is mitigated by the fact that an opposite view, in agreement with the majority, is also attributed to al-Shafi'i.\n\nAccording to Abdulaziz Sachedina, offensive jihad raises questions about whether jihad is justifiable on moral grounds. He states that the Qur'an requires Muslims to establish just public order, increasing the influence of Islam, allowing public Islamic worship, through offensive measures. To this end, the Qur'anic verses revealed required Muslims to wage jihad against unbelievers who persecuted them. This has been complicated by the early Muslim conquests, which he argues were although considered jihad by Sunni scholars, but under close scrutiny can be determined to be political. Moreover, the offensive jihad points more to the complex relationship with the \"People of the book\".\n\nSome major modern scholars who have rejected the idea of \"offensive jihad\" include the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hasan al-Banna (1906–1949), the Al-Azhar scholar Muhammad Abu Zahra (1898–1974) who thought that \"military jihad is permitted only to remove aggression ('udwân) and religious persecution (fitnah) against Muslims\", as well as Syrian scholars Mohamed Said Ramadan Al-Bouti (1929–2013) and Wahbah al-Zuhayli (1932-2015), the latter saying that \"peace is the underlying principle of relations between Muslims and non-Muslims. al-Zuhayli maintains that this view is supported by 8:61, as well as 2:208 and 4:94 that establish the principle of international peace. For him, Muslims should be committed to peace and security (on the basis of 4:90 and 60:8).\"\n\nInternational conflicts are armed strifes conducted by one state against another, and are distinguished from civil wars or armed strife within a state. Some classical Islamic scholars, like the Shafi'i, classified territories into broad categories: \"dar al-islam\" (\"abode of Islam\"), \"dar al-harb\" (\"abode of war), \"dar al-ahd\" (\"abode of treaty\"), and \"dar al-sulh\" (\"abode of reconciliation\"). Such categorizations of states, according to Asma Afsaruddin, are not mentioned in the Qur'an and Islamic tradition.\n\nThe Qur'an commands Muslims to make a proper declaration of war prior to the commencement of military operations. Thus, surprise attacks are illegal under the Islamic jurisprudence. The Qur'an had similarly commanded Muhammad to give his enemies, who had violated the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, a time period of four months to reconsider their position and negotiate. This rule, however, is not binding if the adversary has already started the war. Forcible prevention of religious practice is considered an act of war.\n\nDuring battle the Qur'an commands Muslims to fight against the enemy. However, there are restrictions to such combat. Burning or drowning the enemy is allowed only if it is impossible to achieve victory by other means. The mutilation of dead bodies is prohibited. The Qur'an also discourages Muslim combatants from displaying pomp and unnecessary boasting when setting out for battle.\n\nAccording to professor Sayyid Dāmād, no explicit injunctions against use of chemical or biological warfare were developed by medieval Islamic jurists as these threats were not existent then. However, \"Khalil al-Maliki's Book on jihad\" states that combatants are forbidden to employ weapons that cause unnecessary injury to the enemy, except under dire circumstances. The book, as an example, forbids the use of poisonous spears, since it inflicts unnecessary pain.\n\nAccording to all madhhabs, it is not permissible to kill women or children unless they are fighting against the Muslims. The Hanafi, Hanbali, and Maliki schools forbid killing of those who are not able to fight, including monks, farmers, and serfs, as well as mentally and physically disabled.\nHarming civilian areas and pillaging residential areas is also forbidden, as is the destruction of trees, crops, livestock and farmlands. The Muslim forces may not loot travelers, as doing so is contrary to the spirit of jihad. Nor do they have the right to use the local facilities of the native people without their consent. If such a consent is obtained, the Muslim army is still under the obligation to compensate the people financially for the use of such facilities. However, Islamic law allows the confiscation of military equipment and supplies captured from the camps and military headquarters of the combatant armies.\n\nCommentators of the Qur'an agree that Muslims should always be willing and ready to negotiate peace with the other party without any hesitation. According to Maududi, Islam does not permit Muslims to reject peace and continue bloodshed.\n\nIslamic jurisprudence calls for third party interventions as another means of ending conflicts. Such interventions are to establish mediation between the two parties to achieve a just resolution of the dispute.\n\nIn the context of seventh century Arabia, the Qur'an ordained Muslims must restrain themselves from fighting in the months when fighting was prohibited by Arab pagans. The Qur'an also required the respect of this cease-fire, prohibiting its violation.\n\nIf, however, non-Muslims commit acts of aggression, Muslims are free to retaliate, though in a manner that is equal to the original transgression. The \"sword verse\", which has attracted attention, is directed against a particular group who violate the terms of peace and commit aggression (but excepts those who observe the treaty). Crone states that this verse seems to be based on the same above-mentioned rules. Here also it is stressed that one must stop when they do. Ibn Kathir states that the verse implies a hasty mission of besieging and gathering intelligence about the enemy, resulting in either death or repentance by the enemy. It is read as a continuation of previous verses, it would be concerned with the same oath-breaking of \"polytheists\".\n\nMen, women, and children may all be taken as prisoners of war under traditional interpretations of Islamic law. Generally, a prisoner of war could be, at the discretion of the military leader, executed, freed, ransomed, exchanged for Muslim prisoners, or kept as slaves. In earlier times, the ransom sometimes took an educational dimension, where a literate prisoner of war could secure his or her freedom by teaching ten Muslims to read and write. Some Muslim scholars hold that a prisoner may not be ransomed for gold or silver, but may be exchanged for Muslim prisoners.\n\nWomen and children prisoners of war cannot be killed under any circumstances, regardless of their religious convictions, but they may be freed or ransomed. Women who are neither freed nor ransomed by their people were to be kept in bondage - also referred to as \"malakah\", however dispute exists among scholars on the term's interpretation. Islamic law does not put an exact limit on the number that can be kept in bondage.\n\nInternal conflicts include \"civil wars\", launched against rebels, and \"wars for welfare\" launched against bandits.\n\nDuring their first civil war, Muslims fought at the Battle of Bassorah. In this engagement, Ali (the caliph), set the precedent for war against other Muslims, which most later Muslims have accepted. According to Ali's rules, wounded or captured enemies should not be killed, those throwing away their arms should not be fought, and those fleeing from the battleground should not be pursued. Only captured weapons and animals (horses and camels which have been used in the war) are to be considered war booty. No war prisoners, women or children are to be enslaved and the property of the slain enemies are to go to their legal Muslim heirs.\n\nDifferent views regarding armed rebellion have prevailed in the Muslim world at different times. During the first three centuries of Muslim history, jurists held that a political rebel may not be executed nor his/her property confiscated.\n\nClassical jurists, however, laid down severe penalties for rebels who use \"stealth attacks\" and \"spread terror\". In this category, Muslim jurists included abductions, poisoning of water wells, arson, attacks against wayfarers and travellers, assaults under the cover of night and rape. The punishment for such crimes were severe, including death, regardless of the political convictions and religion of the perpetrator. \n\nSome modern commentators have argued that the classical precedent of harsh punishments for rebels engaging in attacks that harmed civilian populations can be taken as evidence that the religious justifications used by Islamist groups such as al Qaeda and ISIL are not, in fact, grounded in the Islamic tradition.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2193906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193906", "title": "Maghas", "text": "Maghas\n\nMaghas or Maas — more properly, Mags or Maks — was the capital city of Alania, a medieval kingdom in the Greater Caucasus. It is known from Islamic and Chinese sources, but its location is uncertain, with some authors favouring North Ossetia and others pointing to Arkhyz in modern-day Karachay–Cherkessia, where three 10th-century churches still stand. \n\nHowever, the historian John Latham Sprinkle from the University of Ghent (Belgium) claims to have discovered that Il’ichevsk is the exact location of Maghas, by consulting several written sources. \"\"The most important were the report of an Arab geographer from the 940s on Magas and two writings from Persia and one from China from the 13th and 14th centuries on the capture of the city by the Mongols\"\". Latham Sprinkle compared these written sources to the archaeological findings collected by a local teacher in Soviet times on Il'ichevsk, where he also uncovered evidence of a burnt down church as well as the grave of a child. Il’ichevsk has never really been thoroughly researched, this may be because it is positioned in Krasnodar Krai. This is a border province that belongs to Russia itself and with leaders who turn their gaze to Moscow. \"\"Five autonomous regions within Russia claim that they, and they alone, are the heirs of the Alans\"\", \"\"They are all sub-publics with a predominantly non-Russian population and a strong nationalist reflex such as Chechnya, Ingushetia and North Ossetia\"\". \"\"Over the past 200 years, these peoples have designated several sites on their own territory as the original site of Magas to draw on the legacy of Alanië. In 1994, Ingushetia even built a brand-new capital which it also called Magas, although it has nothing to do with the historic Maghas\"\". No site designated by the autonomous regions could ever really convince archaeologists and specialists. \"\"Magas was in the woods and was firmly defended. This did not prevent the Mongols from taking the city and destroying it in the winter of 1239-1240. So to identify Magas with certainty, we need evidence of royal control, ramparts, forests, and destruction in the 13th century. The sites that have emerged so far lack one of these four factors\"\". The irony is that Il'ichevsk is not located in any of the five autonomous regions claiming the inheritance of Alania. Latham Sprinkle's research will be published in the month of June 2020 in the scientific journal Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies. Some archaeologists and specialists on site are already predominantly positive. How politicians and nationalists will react, can' be estimated. But, it may well be that many people in those areas will be particularly interested. This is their historic capital that has finally been discovered.\n\nThe destruction of Maghas is ascribed to Batu Khan, a Mongol leader and a grandson of Genghis Khan, in the beginning of 1239. Some Russian geographers, like D. V. Zayats, point to a location in Ingushetia.\n\nThe capital of the Russian Republic of Ingushetia, Magas, is named after Maghas.\n"}

Completed in 1920, it runs from Tai Po Road in Sham Shui Po, Kowloon to the very north of the New Territories, serving south, west and north New Territories, being one of the most distant roads in early Hong Kong.\n\nThe road was named after Castle Peak, a peak in the western New Territories. The area to the east of the peak was hence named Castle Peak. Later at the dawn of the development of new town, the area was renamed to its old name, Tuen Mun.\n\nThe road was originally known in Chinese as \"Tsing Shan To\" () for its entire length. The Chinese name of the section of the road in the New Territories was later changed to \"Tsing Shan Kung Lo\" () Lit. \"Castle Peak public road\" or \"Castle Peak Highway\". In everyday conversation, however, the term \"Tsing Shan To\" survives for the stretches within Tsuen Wan and Yuen Long.\n\nThe road starts east at Tai Po Road in Sham Shui Po and passes through Cheung Sha Wan and Lai Chi Kok in Kowloon. On both sides of the road are old residential blocks, with some dated back to pre-World War II. Towards Lai Chi Kok, it is surrounded by industrial buildings instead. The road is one-way eastbound between Kom Tsun Street & its terminus at Tai Po Road.\n\nAfter leaving Kowloon, it goes uphill past Kau Wa Keng and Tai Ching Cheung along a four-lane expressway to Kwai Chung and downhill into Tsuen Wan. The stretch within Tsuen Wan is also commonly called the Main Thoroughfare (), especially among the older generations.\n\nNext, it goes along the south shore of the Western New Territories, via Yau Kom Tau, Ting Kau, Sham Tseng, Tsing Lung Tau, Tai Lam, Siu Lam and So Kwun Wat and then reaches the Tuen Mun New Town, which was also known as Castle Peak (after which the road was named). Much of this stretch was bypassed by Tuen Mun Road between 1977 and 1983.\n\nIt continues north-east as a six-laned road, paralleling the Light Rail through Lam Tei, Hung Shui Kiu, Ping Shan and goes through another new town, Yuen Long New Town. The section within Yuen Long, again, is also called 大馬路. This section was bypassed by the Yuen Long Highway in 1992.\n\nIt then turns north at Au Tau, just west of Kam Tin. This section is overshadowed by the San Tin Highway, constructed between 1991 & 1993. It then passes through Mai Po, San Tin, Lok Ma Chau (near the Mainland border), Pak Shek Au and Kwu Tung before terminating at Fan Kam Road in Sheung Shui.\n\n\n"}

All five were shot dead in the ensuing gunfight with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), while one civilian died in the grenade attack that the attackers launched in order to breach the cordoned wall. The CRPF suffered three casualties, two of whom were seriously injured with multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nFollowing the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992, a makeshift temple had been constructed at the Ram Janmabhoomi site, in the city of Ayodhya. According to Hindu mythology, the site was the birthplace of the God-king Rama. On 5 July 2005, the heavily guarded Ram Janmabhoomi - Babri Masjid complex was attacked by heavily armed terrorists. The attack was foiled by security officials and the attackers were killed.\n\nThe terrorists were from the Islamic terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, and were believed to have entered India through Nepal. They posed as pilgrims on their way to Ayodhya, and boarded a Tata Sumo at Akbarpur near the Kichaucha village in Faizabad. At Faizabad they abandoned the Sumo and hired a jeep driven by a driver, Rehan Alam Amsari. According to a statement by the driver, the terrorists visited the Ram (Temple) at Ayodhya where they prayed, possibly to reinforce the impression that they were indeed pilgrims. The terrorists then drove the jeep into the Ram Janmabhoomi site, and forced the driver out of the vehicle, banging the jeep against the security cordon. At 9:05 am, they hurled M67 grenades from 50 metres away to breach the cordon fence. Ramesh Pandey, a pilgrim guide who happened to be near the site at this moment, died on the spot as a result of the grenade blast. Firing indiscriminately, the 5 terrorists entered the \"Mata Sita Rasoi\". Returning the gunfire, a platoon of 35 CRPF soldiers killed all five of the terrorists in a gunfight that lasted for over an hour. Three CRPF soldiers also received serious injuries and, as of July 2008, two remain comatose. All the terrorists died within 100 metres of the site.\n\nThe assailants were suspected to belong to the Islamic terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. The investigating team tracked the phone calls made from the cell phones carried by the terrorists using the IMEI numbers. The Police recovered a single RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade launcher, five Type 56 assault rifles, five M1911 pistols, several M67 grenades and some jihadi documents. Rehan Alam, the jeep driver, was detained by the police for further investigations.\n\nOn 28 July 2005, four Muslim men from Jammu and Kashmir – Akbar Hussain, Lal Mohammad, Mohmmad Naseer and Mohmmad Rafeeq – were arrested in connection with the attack. On 3 August 2005, another four Muslim men– Asif Iqbal, Mohammed Aziz, Mohammed Nasim and Shaqeel Ahmed– were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the bombing. A fifth man, Irfan Khan, was arrested a few days earlier.\n\nMost of India's political organisations condemned the attack as barbaric and requested people to maintain law and order. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, its affiliates the Vishva Hindu Parishad and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) declared an India-wide protest and bandh on 8 July 2005. BJP president L.K. Advani called for the reinstatement of the Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act in the wake of the attack.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2193925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193925", "title": "Fort Colvile", "text": "Fort Colvile\n\nThe trade center Fort Colvile (also Fort Colville) was built by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) at Kettle Falls on the Columbia River in 1825 and operated in the Columbia fur district of the company. Named for Andrew Colvile, a London governor of the HBC, the fort was a few miles west of the present site of Colville, Washington. It was an important stop on the York Factory Express trade route to London via the Hudson Bay. The HBC for some time considered Fort Colvile second in importance only to Fort Vancouver, near the mouth of the Columbia, until the foundation of Fort Victoria.\n\nUnder the Treaty of 1818, the Great Britain and the United States of America both claimed rights to the Oregon Country. This contentious dispute for ownership of the land was ended by the Oregon Treaty of 1846. The boundary between British North America and the United States was extended to the Pacific Ocean on the 49th Parallel, with all of Vancouver Island considered British. During the gold rushes of the 1850s and 1860s, Fort Colvile in 1860 especially became an important centre for mining activity and supplies. Abandoned in June 1871, some buildings stood until they burned in 1910.\n\nThe construction of Grand Coulee Dam resulted in the site being flooded in 1940, as was Kettle Falls. When Lake Roosevelt was drawn down for construction of Grand Coulee Dam's Powerhouse #3 in the late 1960s and early 1970, Fort Colvile and Kettle Falls were revealed. After archaeological work was performed by Washington State University and the University of Idaho, the Fort Colvile site was again inundated by Lake Roosevelt. In 1974, Fort Colvile was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its historic significance.\n\nIt replaced Spokane House as a regional trading center, due to the latter being deemed to be too far from the Columbia River. Governor Simpson considered the disuse of Spokane House to likely offend Spokane elders, and ordered for a dispersement of gifts among them. The removal of the company property at Spokane House was moved to Fort Colvile in March 1826. Simpson also gave instructions to Chief Factor John McLoughlin for \"every possible exertion be used to be lay up an abundant stock of Fish and other provisions\" due to limited capacity to send freight from Fort Vancouver. Additionally Simpson stated that a station on Kettle Falls would be \"a more desirable situation in regard to Farming, fish, provisions generally as also in respect to Trade...\" than the Spokane House.\n\nDuring the 1820s, yearly purchases of furs rarely exceeded 20 blankets being sold. Increased amounts of animal hides were gathered by Fort Colvile started with the \"Flat Head brigade\", which joined the Bitterroot Salish on their annual migrations past the Rocky Mountains. A skirmish in 1829 between the Bitterroot Salish and inhabitants of Columbia Lake caused fears among HBC employees about the defenseless state of Fort Colvile Additional employees were sent to erect a palisade and establish the mill during the Winter.\n\nThe staff number for Fort Colvile fluctuated with the seasons. Operations commencing in the Spring required upwards of 30 employees during the 1830s. Usually only five men were stationed there throughout Winter, and if number was above that, McLoughlin would reassign the extra staff. Spokane Garry was considered a prospective employee at the Fort until McLoughlin rejected the proposition. ABCFM Missionaries established Tshimakain Mission in 1838 and developed ties to officers of Fort Colvile, then the closest white settlement in the area. After the Whitman Massacre, the missionary families of Elkanah Walker and Cushing Eells fled their station for the protection of the HBC trading post. Alex McLeod, born at the fort in 1854 recalled that \"The trading post proper was a square enclosure. The store and warehouses were on the north side and Chief Trader McDonald's house was on the east side. The married employees, like my father, lived outside the inclosed post yard on the south and west sides.\"\n\nAgricultural operations at Fort Colvile were prominent, eventually supplying other interior posts with wheat, peas, flint corn and potatoes. The prairie, the station was located on, was deemed an \"island of fertility\" by visiting artist Paul Kane. At its foundation 24 bushels of potatoes were sown, but over half was eaten by rodents. The farm was able to produce enough crops to feed its staff and Fort Nez Perces in 1830. The harvest wasn't large enough to support the brigade of fur trappers headed to the New Caledonia district, requiring shipments from Fort Vancouver. 20 Native and White men labored on the farms in 1838, about two thirds of the total number of men kept at trade post. The potato harvests had increased greatly in size compared to the initial sowing, in 1838 it was over 7,000 bushels. Charles Wilkes of the United States Exploring Expedition found that farming was the primary focus of the establishment \"for the whole of the northern posts depend upon Colville for supplies of provisions.\" Salmon was easily procured when the seasonal runs were commenced. One pioneer recalled that Kettle Falls men would \"put large wicker baskets below the falls and raised them up three times a day, always filled with fish.\"\n\nAfter the signing of the Oregon Treaty of 1846, Fort Colvile was south of the 49th parallel and therefore within American claimed land. The Hudson's Bay Company founded Fort Shepherd, just north of the new boundary, as a surrogate location secure on British territory. They continued some operations at Fort Colvile for a few years longer. While traveling through in 1853, Washington Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens described Fort Colvile as: The buildings consist of a dwelling house, three or four store-houses, and some smaller buildings, used as blacksmith shops, etc., all of one story and constructed of squared logs. The whole was once surrounded by a stockade, forming a square of about 70 yards on each side. This has been removed, except on the north side, where it encloses a narrow yard containing offices. One bastion remains. About 30 yards in the rear of this square are the cattle yards, hay sheds, etc., enclosing a space of 40 by 60 yards, roughly fenced in, and the sheds covered with bark. On the left of the front are seven huts, occupied by the lower of the company. They are of rude construction, and much decayed. On the right of the square, in the rear, at a distance of a few hundred yards, are three more buildings, used for storing produce.\n\nIn 1859 the Palliser Expedition reunited in Fort Colvile and proceeded down the Columbia River, after having explored much of what is now western Canada, from the Great Lakes to Lake Okanagan. The mill maintained at the fort was sold in 1865. Early settlers surrounding Colvile were often French-Canadians formerly in the employ of the HBC. At social occasions held at their former station, \"would drink whisky [sic] and brandy and sing old songs or tell tales of hunting experiences.\" Such outings were found to be composed of \"the lighthearted trapper with his gaudy moccasins and leggings, through all shades of colour to the dusky hue of the Indians\".\n\n\n"}

Originally known as the RCA Victor Building when designed in 1931 by John W. Cross of Cross & Cross, it is sometimes known by its address to avoid confusion with the much later renaming – in 1988 – of the RCA Building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza as the \"GE Building\", itself later renamed the \"Comcast Building\".\n\nThe building was designated a New York City landmark in 1985, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 28, 2004. It is the 107th tallest building in New York.\n\nAt the time that RCA Victor commissioned this building, it was a subsidiary of General Electric. The company then moved its headquarters to Rockefeller Center, and this building was deeded over to the parent company. The building was donated to Columbia University in 1993 to gain a $40 million tax deduction. The university formed a joint venture with Mendik Company and Quantum Realty Partners and refurbished the building in 1994. Mendik bought out Columbia in 2001. Tower 570 Company, LP, an affiliate of The Feil Organization, is the building's current owner.\n\nThe building's 50-floor stylized Gothic octagonal brick tower, with elaborate Art Deco decorations of lightning bolts showing the power of electricity, grows out of the round-cornered base with elaborate masonry and architectural figural sculpture, to form \"one of the most expressive skyscrapers of its era.\" The building was designed to blend with the low Byzantine dome of St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue and shares the same brick color, with terra cotta decorations chosen to coordinate. The crown of the building is an example of Gothic tracery, which is intended to represent electricity and radio waves, and is lit from within at night. On the corner above the building's main entrance is a clock with the cursive GE logo and a pair of disembodied silver arms holding bolts of electricity.\n\nThe \"AIA Guide to New York City\" says that the building's \"Art Deco details at both street and sky are both sumptuous and exuberant.\" A \"major example\" of Art Deco architecture, the style is \"both symbolic and expressive of the building's function,\" according to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.\n\nAfter the building was donated to Columbia University, it was extensively renovated by Ernest de Castro of the WCA Design Group.\n\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

For many years in the Byzantine Empire, this work contained the sum of all Western medical knowledge and was unrivaled in its accuracy and completeness.\n\nNothing is known about his life, except that he was born in the island of Aegina, and that he travelled a good deal, visiting, among other places, Alexandria. He is sometimes called \"Iatrosophistes\" and \"Periodeutes\", a word which probably means a physician who travelled from place to place in the exercise of his profession. The exact time when he lived is not known; but, as he quotes Alexander of Tralles, and is himself quoted by Yahya ibn Sarafyun (\"Serapion the Elder\"), it is probable that Abu-al-Faraj is correct in placing him in the latter half of the 7th century.\n\nThe Suda says he wrote several medical works, of which the principal one is still extant, with no exact title, but is commonly called \"Medical Compendium in Seven Books\" (, \"Epitomes iatrikes biblia hepta\"). (Digital German edition by the University and State Library Düsseldorf) This work is chiefly a compilation from earlier writers; indeed its Greek title proclaims that it is an epitome of medicine, \"epitomes iatrikes.\"\n\nWilliam Alexander Greenhill wrote that his reputation in the Islamic world seems to have been very great, and it is said that he was especially consulted by midwives, whence he received the name of \"Al-kawabeli\" or \"the Accoucheur.\" He is said by the Arabic writers to have written a work, \"De Mulierum Morbis,\" and another, \"De Puerulorum Vivendi Ratione atque Curatione.\" His great work was translated into Arabic by Hunayn ibn Ishaq.\n\nThe sixth book on surgery in particular was referenced in Europe and the Arab world throughout the Middle Ages, and is of special interest for surgical history. The whole work in the original Greek was published in Venice in 1528, and another edition appeared in Basel in 1538. Several Latin translations were published. Its first full translation into English, was by Francis Adams in 1834.\n\nIn this work he describes the operation to fix a hernia similar to modern techniques writing, \"After making the incision to the extent of three fingers' breadth transversely across the tumor to the groin, and removing the membranes and fat, and the peritoneum being exposed in the middle where it is raised up to a point, let the knob of the probe be applied by which the intestines will be pressed deep down. The prominence, then, of the peritoneum, formed on each side of the knob of the probe, are to be joined together by sutures, and then we extract the probe, neither cutting the peritoneum nor removing the testicle, nor anything else, but curing it with applications used for fresh wounds.\" \n\n\n"}

The area is governed by Newport City Council.\n\nLliswerry has been well known across the city for the railway bridge over Somerton Road with 'This is Lliswerry with 2 L's' painted in white across it. Lliswerry is an anglicised version of the place name \"Llyswyry\" translating to Maiden's Court. (\"Llys\" - Court, \"Gwyryf\" > \"Wyryf\" > \"Wyry\" - Maiden). It is believed that there was a manor house in the area belonging to the Welsh King of Brycheiniog. His daughter had connections to the manor/court. It was likely that the house was in the area of Traston Road today.\n\nThe King public house on Somerton Road was sold to an anonymous telephone buyer in May 2013 for £140,000. The pub, which was once known as the King of Prussia, was used as a base by Newport County; before Somerton Park had changing rooms, teams would change at the pub then walk along Somerton Road to play. The club would hold social gatherings and also do their laundry there.\n\nThe community is bounded by the River Usk to the west, Lilleshall Street and Telford Street to the northeast, the Great Western main line to the north, the original western end of Llanwern steelworks and Meadows Road to the east, and Nash Road, Traston Road, Corporation Road and Stephenson Street to the south. Lliswerry Ward is composed of both the Lliswerry and Nash communities and is represented by Cllr Ken Critchley, Cllr Roger Jeavons, Cllr Allan Morris and Cllr John Richards.\n\nThe ward is the site of the City of Newport Campus of Coleg Gwent (commonly referred to as 'Nash College') and the Newport International Sports Village. Lliswerry High School is adjacent to the college campus. Lliswerry also has a primary school, further north along Nash Road.\n\nLliswerry has four churches: St. Andrew's Church in Wales church, in the benefice of Newport, Maindee and Newport, Lliswerry, is situated in Somerton Road; Lliswerry Baptist Church in Camperdown Road; Saint Patrick's Catholic Church in Cromwell Road, the only parish administered by the Rosminians in Newport; and St Philip's Church in Wales church in Jenkin Street.\n\nThere is a Post Office at 63, Somerton Road and a medical centre on Fallowfield Drive.\n\nLliswery Pond was formed, near the railway line, when quarrying excavations struck an underground stream which flooded that area. At its deepest point the pond is and it is well-stocked with fish, including large pike. The pond was refurbished in 2008 and is maintained by many enthusiasts, as well as the local angling association, Alway Community Association and Newport City Council.\n\nThe suburb is also home to the Newport International Sports Village and Newport Stadium which, from 1994 to 2012, was the home ground of the Newport County football team.

His career progressed and by 1765 he had moved from Birmingham to Trostrey, in Monmouthshire, and was the manager of a forge. His property and business interests in Birmingham were now managed by his father and it was the sale of one of his properties that financed the purchase of a forge at Rogerstone, South Wales.\n\nHe remained there until 1770 when he bought a estate in Cefn Cribwr, near Bridgend, where he planned to establish not only an iron works, complete with blast furnace and forge, but also the collieries, brickworks, mines and stone quarries to support it. Bedford, it seems, brought a sum of £36,000 to fund this venture and was possibly attracted to the area by the availability of local raw materials and its proximity to the sea via the harbor town of Porthcawl.\n\nThe venture failed to reach its full potential due to a number of factors, which included John Bedford’s own eccentricity, the geographic position of the iron works, his reliance on borrowing and his lack of business acumen. His correspondence indicates that he was more interested in experimentation and development of the iron making techniques than running a viable business. Also apparent through his manuscripts of 1786 was his romantic thoughts about architecture, where he believed aesthetic beauty as important as functionality.\n\nAlthough not renowned for his success on business side of iron making he was recognised for his contributions to the iron industry through the vast amount of correspondence he left, now held at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth.\n\nJohn Bedford died on 30 September 1791, at Digbeth, Birmingham, and was buried at Marston Chapel, Hall Green, Birmingham.\n\nHis estate was divided between his wife and children and an area of his Cefn Cribwr estate was named Bedford Park, as a dedication to him. After his death the iron works and mine were sold off but the iron working continued until 1836. The brick making and coal mining, however, continued.\n\nHis great-grandson was famed aeronautics engineer, Sir Morien Morgan.\n\n\nJohn Bedford and the Ironworks at Cefn Cribwr\n"}

Originally published by Penguin Books between 1983 and 1985, the titles are part of the \"Fighting Fantasy\" canon, but were not allocated numbers within the original 59-book series. \"Sorcery!\" was re-published by Wizard Books in 2003 and recreated as the \"Sorcery!\" video game series by Inkle.\n\nThe \"Sorcery!\" series was published by Penguin Books (and later by their Puffin Books imprint) as four individual titles, beginning in 1983 with \"The Shamutanti Hills\", followed by \"Kharé: Cityport of Traps\" and \"The Seven Serpents\" in 1984, and \"The Crown of Kings\" in 1985.\n\nEach title could be played as an individual adventure or as part of the overall story arc. The series was supported by the \"Sorcery! Spellbook\", published in 1983, which was eventually incorporated as an appendix into the four titles in later printings. A boxed set titled \"Sorcery!\" was released, containing both \"The Shamutanti Hills\" and the spellbook. The series was reissued by Wizard Books in 2003.\n\n\"Sorcery!\" features several mechanics not present in previous \"Fighting Fantasy\" gamebooks. The principal difference is the ability to choose between playing as a warrior or a wizard. As a wizard, the player is weaker in combat, but has access to 48 spells, with each appearing as a three-letter word that has to be memorised by the player. Examples include ZAP (creates a lightning bolt from the finger) and HOT (creates a fireball). When given the option to cast spells the player is presented with a small selection of these three-letter words to choose from; the player is encouraged to choose from these without consulting the spell listing. It is also possible to fail to cast at all, as false spell words are placed alongside correct choices. Many spells also require a certain item (e.g. GOB requires one or more goblin teeth). If the character does not have the necessary equipment then the spell fails. All spell choices, irrespective of the outcome, incur a Stamina penalty.\n\nWarriors and wizards share the ability to call on the character's patron goddess, Libra, once each adventure. The goddess can perform a range of services, such as restoring lost Skill/Stamina/Luck points or curing a curse, or in specific locations, providing an automatic escape from that situation.\n\nThe series features strong continuity: it is possible for a reader to use the same character – complete with any upgraded abilities and equipment – through each of the titles, and also use hidden clues found in one title to assist with a situation in another. Each title also features dice images at the bottom of each page, making it possible for the player to randomly \"flick\" through the pages for the equivalent of a dice roll.\n\nThe story is set on the fictional \"Fighting Fantasy\" world of Titan, on the continent known as The Old World. A powerful artifact known as the Crown of Kings, which bestows magical powers of leadership upon its owner, has been stolen from the land of Analand by the cruel Archmage of Mampang Fortress. With the Crown, the Archmage will be able to gain leadership of the lawless and brutal region of Kakhabad and begin an invasion of surrounding kingdoms. The player takes on the role of the lone hero, referred to only as the Analander, who has been dispatched to retrieve the Crown, thereby averting the invasion and saving Analand from terrible disgrace. The quest itself is divided between the four titles in the series:\n\n\"The Shamutanti Hills\"\n\"Kharé – Cityport of Traps\"\n\"The Seven Serpents\"\n\"The Crown of Kings\"\n\nThe first three gamebooks in the series were converted into 40-page d20 System multi-player role-playing adventures by Jamie Wallis. They were published by Myriador in 2003 and 2004 respectively, and reissued in pdf format by Greywood Publishing in 2009. The fourth and final installment was never released.\n\n\nThe gamebook series have been ported to computerized media as \"Steve Jackson's Sorcery!\" by Inkle. The first part was released for iOS in 2013, and by 2016 all four parts were available for iOS, Android, and Steam (on Mac and PC).\n\nThe four gamebooks were converted into a RPG adventure book by Graham Bottley, for the Advanced Fighting Fantasy system. The book was titled \"Crown of Kings:The Sorcery! Campaign\", and was published in 2012 by Arion Games. The book was credited to Jackson and Bottley. The book also reprinted Blanche's illustrations.\n\nPete Tamlyn reviewed \"Sorcery\" for \"Imagine\" magazine, and stated that \"\"Sorcery\" is actually a fine example of back-to-basics role-playing.

Jesus has just reported that he came not to destroy the law, but fulfil it. In this verse this claim is reinforced.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 5:18.\n\nThe opening \"for truly I say to you,\" which can also be translated as \"amen I say to you,\" is the first occurrence of one of the author of Matthew's favourite turns of phrase. Boring notes that it occurs thirty-two more times in the Gospel.Schweizer states that it was a typical statement among Koine Greek speaking Jews, but could also have sometimes been used by Aramaic speakers like Jesus.\n\nThis verse is the origin of two common English expressions. In Greek the word translated as \"jot\" in the KJV is iota, and \"not one iota\" is used to refer to something with not even the smallest change. The expression \"dotting the Is and crossing the Ts\", meaning paying attention to detail or putting the final touches on something, also has its origin in this verse.\n\nJesus probably would have been speaking about the Aramaic alphabet, see Aramaic of Jesus, and scholars have long tried to guess what would originally have been referred to by this phrase. Iota is the smallest letter of the Greek alphabet, and was often left out by transcribers, however, since only capitals were used at the time the Greek New Testament was written (Ι), it probably represents the Aramaic yodh (י) which is the smallest letter of the Aramaic alphabet, and like iota it was frequently forgotten. Lachs notes that this expression only works with the Aramaic alphabet or square script, and not the Ancient Hebrew alphabet. This is historically consistent as the Aramaic script had largely displaced the ancient one by this period. \n\nThe word translated as tittle in the KJV in Greek is \"keraia\", and there is much debate as to what it might have referred to. The word \"keraia\" literally translates as horns. One possibility is that it refers to the decorative crowns placed atop some Hebrew letters, this would not work for Jesus, however, as such markings only began to be used in the later part of the first century. Burkitt feels it would have been waw, the second smallest letter. Gundry notes that it could also have referred to the small projections that separate certain letters. It could refer to accents in Greek but more likely hooks on Aramaic letters, (ב) versus (כ), or additional marks such as crowns (as Vulgate \"apex\") found in Jewish Bibles. \n\nThe main debate over the interpretation of this verse is just how absolute it is. Schweizer feels that \"until heaven and earth pass away\" means that the Mosaic Law will only last until the end times, and will be superseded in the messianic age. He argues that the opening \"for truly I say to you\" is \"typical of statements concerning the eschaton.\" He also believes that this verse is a modification of the clearly eschatological one at Mark 13:31. France disagrees feeling that \"until heaven and earth pass away\" is simply an idiom for the inconceivable.\n\n\"Until all things are accomplished\" is also the subject of controversy. It is uncertain what \"all\" is referring to and how it will be accomplished. France lists three interpretations: until the end of the world, until all the requirements of the Law are met, until the arrival of the messiah. The three interpretations all imply very different understandings of how absolute Mosaic law is for Christians in the current era (see also antinomianism).\n"}

Most of his personal achievements derived from his time with Seattle. In February, 2010 he was ranked 11th in the USL First Division Top 25 of the Decade, which announced a list of the best and most influential players of the previous decade.\n\nHe grew up in the Pacific Northwest, graduating from Federal Way High School in 1994. He played college soccer at the University of San Diego, redshirting his freshman season after an early season injury sidelined him.\n\nO'Brien was drafted by the New England Revolution in the third round of the 1999 MLS College Draft. He never played for the Revs before being waived on March 31, 1999. On April 5, 1999, the San Jose Clash claimed O'Brien in the waiver draft. He spent most of the season on loan with MLS Pro-40 and only four games with the Clash first team before being released at the end of the season. In 2000, he signed with the San Diego Flash of the USL A-League. At some point, he also played for the Sacramento Knights of the World Indoor Soccer League.\n\nOn April 30, 2001, Leighton signed with the Seattle Sounders, where he had a successful season by posting 11 goals and seven assists, All-League honors. Following the completion of the USL season, he signed with the Sacramento Knights of the World Indoor Soccer League for the remainder of their season. In 2002, the Sounders loaned him to the Clash. In 2002, he had another successful campaign with the Sounders where his 13 goals and 11 assists helped the Sounders claim the regular season championship. His efforts also earned him All-League recognition, Assist Leader honor, and was named the USL A-League MVP. He then signed on loan from the Sounders with the Milwaukee Wave of Major Indoor Soccer League for the 2002–2003 season. He played two winter indoor seasons, 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 with the Wave.

At the time, he was still under contract with the Sounders. The Sounders released him to Salt Lake in exchange for the team to play an exhibition against Seattle. Salt Lake loaned O'Brien back to Seattle several times during the season before releasing him on August 19, 2005. O'Brien immediately signed with the Sounders. His free kick in the 2005 USL-1 Final started what would become Seattle Sounders tying goal. His kick was redirected twice before Maykel Galindo scored Seattle's goal in a 1-1 draw with Richmond Kickers. O'Brien then scored one of four penalty kicks for Seattle as they won the 2005 Championship in penalty kicks. Leighton signed back on with Seattle for the 2006 season, and in 2007, he helped the Sounders claim the double. He remained with the club for its final season as the team folded at the end of 2008 due to Seattle Sounders FC joining Major League Soccer.\n\nHaving been unable to secure a professional contract, O'Brien signed with Tacoma Tide of the USL Premier Development League for the 2009 season.\n\nOn August 7, 2009 O'Brien signed a contract for the remainder of the season with the Montreal Impact, joining his brother Ciaran O'Brien who was on loan with the same team.

{"id": "2193975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193975", "title": "EtherChannel", "text": "EtherChannel\n\nEtherChannel is a port link aggregation technology or port-channel architecture used primarily on Cisco switches. It allows grouping of several physical Ethernet links to create one logical Ethernet link for the purpose of providing fault-tolerance and high-speed links between switches, routers and servers. An EtherChannel can be created from between two and eight active Fast, Gigabit or 10-Gigabit Ethernet ports, with an additional one to eight inactive (failover) ports which become active as the other active ports fail. EtherChannel is primarily used in the backbone network, but can also be used to connect end user machines.\n\nEtherChannel technology was invented by Kalpana and conceptualized by Kalpana employee Scott Childs in the early 1990s. It was later acquired by Cisco Systems in 1994. In 2000 the IEEE passed 802.3ad which is an open standard version of EtherChannel.\n\nUsing an EtherChannel has numerous advantages, and probably the most desirable aspect is the bandwidth. Using the maximum of 8 active ports a total bandwidth of 800 Mbit/s, 8 Gbit/s or 80 Gbit/s is possible depending on port speed. This assumes there is a traffic mixture, as those speeds do not apply to a single application only. It can be used with Ethernet running on twisted pair wiring, single-mode and multimode fiber.\n\nBecause EtherChannel takes advantage of existing wiring it makes it very scalable. It can be used at all levels of the network to create higher bandwidth links as the traffic needs of the network increase. All Cisco switches have the ability to support EtherChannel.\n\nWhen an EtherChannel is configured all adapters that are part of the channel share the same Layer 2 (MAC) address. This makes the EtherChannel transparent to network applications and users because they only see the one logical connection; they have no knowledge of the individual links.\n\nEtherChannel aggregates the traffic across all the available active ports in the channel. The port is selected using a Cisco-proprietary hash algorithm, based on source or destination MAC addresses, IP addresses or TCP and UDP port numbers. The hash function gives a number between 0 and 7, and the following table shows how the 8 numbers are distributed among the 2 to 8 physical ports. In the hypothesis of real random hash algorithm, 2, 4 or 8 ports configurations lead to fair load-balancing, whereas other configurations lead to unfair load-balancing.\nFault-tolerance is another key aspect of EtherChannel. Should a link fail, the EtherChannel technology will automatically redistribute traffic across the remaining links. This automatic recovery takes less than one second and is transparent to network applications and the end user. This makes it very resilient and desirable for mission-critical applications.\n\nSpanning tree protocol (STP) can be used with an EtherChannel. STP treats all the links as a single one and BPDUs are only sent down one of the links. Without the use of an EtherChannel, STP would effectively shutdown any redundant links between switches until one connection goes down. This is where an EtherChannel is most desirable, it allows use of all available links between two devices.\n\nEtherChannels can be also configured as VLAN trunks. If any single link of an EtherChannel is configured as a VLAN trunk, the entire EtherChannel will act as a VLAN trunk. Cisco ISL, VTP and IEEE 802.1Q are compatible with EtherChannel.\n\nA limitation of EtherChannel is that all the physical ports in the aggregation group must reside on the same switch except in the case of a switch stack, where they can reside on different switches on the stack. Avaya's SMLT protocol removes this limitation by allowing the physical ports to be split between two switches in a triangle configuration or 4 or more switches in a mesh configuration. Cisco's Virtual Switching System (VSS) allows the creation of a Multichassis Etherchannel (MEC) similar to the DMLT protocol allowing ports to be aggregated towards different physical chassis that form a single \"virtual switch\" entity. Also Extreme Networks may do this functionality via M-LAG Multilink Agreggation. Cisco Nexus series of switches allow the creation of a \"Virtual PortChannel\" (VPC) between a remote device and two individual Nexus switches. The two Cisco Nexus switches involved in a VPC differ from stacking or VSS technology in that stacking and VSS create a single data and control plane across the multiple switches, whereas VPC creates a single data plane across the two Nexus switches while keeping the two control planes separate.\n\nEtherChannel is made up of the following key elements:\n\n\nEtherChannel and IEEE 802.3ad standards are very similar and accomplish the same goal. There are a few differences between the two, other than the fact that EtherChannel is Cisco proprietary and 802.3ad is an open standard, listed below:\n\nBoth technologies are capable of automatically configuring this logical link. EtherChannel supports both LACP and Cisco's PAgP, whereas 802.3ad uses LACP.\n\nLACP allows for up to 8 active and 8 standby links, whereas PAgP only allows for 8 active links.\n\n\n\n"}

The poems date to the second half of the 13th century, and if their purported author is historical, he would be the first documented Jewish poet of the German language.\n\nThe town of is today part of the Elfershausen municipality, in Lower Franconia, Bavaria, at the time within the Bishopric of Würzburg.\n\nThere are no records about Susskind's life and not even proof that the poems recorded under his name are from a single author. Yet Susskind (\"Süßkind\") was a specifically Jewish name, and the spelling of the poems corresponds to an author raised in the Rhinelands, where Susskind is alleged to have come from. There is a Jewish motive in V,2, where the poet proclaims his intention to leave the courtly sphere and live humbly \"in the manner of old Jews\", possible allusions to Hebrew prayers in I,3. and, while wandering minstrels generally were unmarried, the poet praises his wife in III,2 and sings of the hunger of his children in V,1, which, if based on facts, would correspond to the Jewish religious obligation to marry and propagate. Written between 1250 and 1300, the poems were incorporated into the collection around 1330, when memories of their possible author could have still been prevalent.\n\nThe frontispiece preceding Süßkind's works in the Codex Manesse (which is not to be taken as a portrait in the modern sense) identifies him as a Jew by means of a characteristically pointed Judenhut (the headgear which Jews were required to wear by law in the later German Middle Ages) and a long curled beard, also frequently associated with Jews. Though Süßkind refers to himself as an impoverished, itinerant minstrel in his verses, the painter depicts him wearing an expensive fur-lined cloak. The poet stands before a seated dignitary who is either a bishop or an abbot: he carries a crozier but lacks a mitre. This figure is enthroned under a standard which is variously said to be the flag of the town of Constance (whose bishop was closely associated with the codex), of Fulda (near Frankfurt/Main) or of the archbishop of Cologne. Two additional figures serve as intermediaries. All four figures gesticulate animatedly, denoting a lively exchange of words.\n\nThe subject of their discourse is a matter of controversy. It has been interpreted as a recitation of verse by the poet before an episcopal audience; a legal proceeding between Süßkind and two Christians presided over by the bishop; or a theological debate between Christianity and Judaism.\n\nWhile most of the content of \"Codex Manesse\" is Minnesang, Susskind was not a \"minnesinger\", his poems belonging to the more general category of medieval \"Spruchdichtung\".\n\nHe sang of the worth of the virtuous wife (III,2), and of the hunger and misery of his children (V,1). \nThere are possible allusions to Hebrew prayers and benedictions in his texts, as in I,3, where his comparison of the briefness of man's days and his salvation through God correspond to the 33rd benediction said on the eve of the Jewish New Year.\nHe stated that nobility – and this at the high time of chivalry, in a collection where every singer of remotely noble descent is portrayed with a coat of arms – is not dependent on birth, but on one's deeds: “Nobility is not dependent on a piece of paper / Who acts nobly, him will I account noble.”\n\nIn one of the last poems in the \"Codex\" (V,2) he bitterly complains that he fooled himself with his attempts to be an artist (\"Ich var ûf der tôren vart /\nmit mîner künste zwâre\"), that he is now determined to let his grey beard grow long and henceforth go his way humbly as a Jew, wrapped in a long coat, his hat pulled deep in his face, and won't sing any chivalrous (\"hovelîchen\") song, since the noblemen (\"herren\") won't grant him any further support.\n\nThe most characteristic of his poems is the \"Fable of the Wolf\", where a wolf complains about his bad reputation, and argues that he is innocent because he is forced to steal geese to survive, while the false man does much greater damage.\n\nAs the only Jewish poet of the \"Codex Manesse\", Susskind was the subject of particular attention in scholarship since the 18th century. \nHis historicity was controversially debated, his poems were translated into modern German and into Polish.\nGerhardt (1997) is a summary of the history of the modern reception of the Susskind poems.\n\nFriedrich Torberg wrote a fictionalized biography of the poet, entitled \"Süsskind von Trimberg\" (Frankfurt am Main: Fischer, 1972).\n\n\n"}

A functional model of a system is thereby replaced by a series of functional models of subsystems.\n\nA decomposition paradigm in computer programming is a strategy for organizing a program as a number of parts, and it usually implies a specific way to organize a program text. Usually the aim of using a decomposition paradigm is to optimize some metric related to program complexity, for example the modularity of the program or its maintainability.\n\nMost decomposition paradigms suggest breaking down a program into parts so as to minimize the static dependencies among those parts, and to maximize the cohesiveness of each part. Some popular decomposition paradigms are the procedural, modules, abstract data type and object oriented ones.\n\nThe concept of decomposition paradigm is entirely independent and different from that of model of computation, but the two are often confused, most often in the cases of the functional model of computation being confused with procedural decomposition, and of the actor model of computation being confused with object oriented decomposition.\n\nA decomposition diagram shows a complex, process, organization, data subject area, or other type of object broken down into lower level, more detailed components. For example, decomposition diagrams may represent organizational structure or functional decomposition into processes.

{"id": "2194001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194001", "title": "Douglas Preston", "text": "Douglas Preston\n\nDouglas Jerome Preston (born May 31, 1956) is an American journalist and author. Although he is best known for his thrillers in collaboration with Lincoln Child (including the \"Agent Pendergast\" series and \"Gideon Crew\" series), he has also written six solo novels, including the \"Wyman Ford\" series and a novel entitled \"Jennie\", which was made into a movie by Disney. He has authored a half-dozen nonfiction books on science and exploration and writes occasionally for \"The New Yorker\", \"Smithsonian\", and other magazines.\n\nPreston was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts and grew up in Wellesley, Massachusetts. A graduate of the Cambridge School of Weston in Weston, Massachusetts, and Pomona College in Claremont, California, Preston began his writing career at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1985, Preston worked for the American Museum of Natural History as a writer, editor, and manager of publications. He served as managing editor for the journal \"Curator\" and was a columnist for \"Natural History\" magazine. In 1985 he published a history of the museum, \"Dinosaurs In The Attic: An Excursion into the American Museum of Natural History\", which chronicled the explorers and expeditions of the museum's early days. The editor of that book at St. Martin's Press was his future writing partner, Lincoln Child. They soon collaborated on a thriller set in the museum titled \"Relic\". It was subsequently made into a motion picture by Paramount Pictures starring Penelope Ann Miller, Tom Sizemore, and Linda Hunt.\n\nIn 1986, Preston moved to New Mexico and began to write full-time. Seeking an understanding of the first moment of contact between Europeans and Native Americans in America, he retraced on horseback Francisco Vásquez de Coronado's violent and unsuccessful search for the legendary Seven Cities of Gold. That thousand mile journey across the American Southwest resulted in the book \"Cities of Gold: A Journey Across the American Southwest\". Since that time, Preston has undertaken many long horseback journeys retracing historic or prehistoric trails, for which he was inducted into the Long Riders' Guild. He has also participated in expeditions in other parts of the world, including a journey deep into Khmer Rouge-held territory in the Cambodian jungle with a small army of soldiers, to become the first Westerner to visit a lost Angkor temple. He was the first person in 3,000 years to enter an ancient Egyptian burial chamber in a tomb known as KV5 in the Valley of the Kings. Preston participated in an expedition that led to the discovery of an ancient city in an unexplored valley in the Mosquitia mountains of Eastern Honduras, which he chronicled in a nonfiction book, \"The Lost City of the Monkey God: A True Story\". On that expedition he and other expedition members contracted an incurable tropical disease known as mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, for which he received treatment at the National Institutes of Health. In 1989 and 1990 he taught nonfiction writing at Princeton University. In 2019, he was elected President of the Authors Guild, and he has also been active in the International Thriller Writers organization.\n\nWith his frequent collaborator Lincoln Child, he created the character of FBI Special Agent Pendergast, who appears in many of their novels, including \"Relic\", \"The Cabinet of Curiosities\", \"Brimstone\", and \"White Fire\". Additional novels by the Preston and Child team include \"Mount Dragon\", \"Riptide\", \"Thunderhead\", and \"The Ice Limit\". Later, the duo created the Gideon Crew series, which consists of \"Gideon's Sword\", \"Gideon's Corpse\", and \"The Lost Island\".\n\nFor his solo career, Preston's fictional debut was \"Jennie\", a novel about a chimpanzee who is adopted by an American family. His next novel was \"The Codex\", a treasure hunt novel with a style that was much closer to the thriller genre of his collaborations with Child. \"The Codex\" introduced the characters of Tom Broadbent and Sally Colorado. Tom and Sally return in \"Tyrannosaur Canyon\", which also features the debut of Wyman Ford, an ex-CIA agent and (at the time) a monk-in-training. Following \"Tyrannosaur Canyon\", Ford leaves the monastery where he is training, forms his own private investigation company, and replaces Broadbent as the main protagonist of Preston's solo works. Ford subsequently returns in \"Blasphemy\", \"Impact\", and \"The Kraken Project\".\n\nIn addition to his collaborations with Child and his solo fictional universe, Preston has written several nonfiction books of his own, mainly dealing with the history of the American Southwest. He has written about archaeology and paleontology for \"The New Yorker\" magazine and has also been published in \"Smithsonian\", \"Harper's\", \"The Atlantic\", \"Natural History\", and \"National Geographic\".\n\nIn May, 2011, Pomona College conferred on Preston the degree of Doctor of Letters (Honoris Causa). He is the recipient of writing awards in the United States and Europe.\n\nIn 2000, Preston moved to Florence, Italy with his young family and became fascinated with an unsolved local murder mystery involving a serial killer nicknamed the \"Monster of Florence\". The case and his problems with the Italian authorities are the subject of his 2008 book \"The Monster of Florence\", co-authored with Italian journalist Mario Spezi. The book spent three months on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list and won a number of journalism awards in Europe and the United States. It is being developed into a movie by 20th Century Fox, produced by George Clooney. Clooney will play the role of Preston.\n\nPreston has criticized the conduct of Italian prosecutor Giuliano Mignini in the trial of American student Amanda Knox, one of three convicted, and eventually cleared, of the murder of British student Meredith Kercher in Perugia in 2007. In 2009, Preston argued on \"48 Hours\" on CBS that the case against Knox was \"based on lies, superstition, and crazy conspiracy theories\". In December 2009, after the verdict had been announced, he described his own interrogation by Mignini on \"Anderson Cooper 360°\" on CNN. Preston said of Mignini, \"this is a very abusive prosecutor. He makes up theories. He's ... obsessed with satanic sex.\"\n\nIn 2010, Preston participated in the first USO tour sponsored by the International Thriller Writers organization, along with authors David Morrell, Steve Berry, Andy Harp, and James Rollins. After visiting with wounded soldiers and giving away books at National Navy Medical Center and Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the group spent over a week in Kuwait and Iraq, marking “the first time in the USO’s 69-year history that authors visited a combat zone.” Of the experience, Preston said, “As always, we learn a great deal from all of the amazing and dedicated people we meet.”\n\nIn 2014, during a disagreement over terms between Hachette Book Group and Amazon.com, Inc., Preston initiated an effort which became known as Authors United. During the contract dispute, books by Hachette authors faced significant shipment delays, blocked availability, and reduced discounts on the Amazon website. Frustrated with tactics he felt unjustly injured authors who were caught in the middle, Preston began garnering the support of like-minded authors from a variety of publishers. In the first open letter from Authors United, over 900 signatories urged Amazon to resolve the dispute and end the policy of sanctions, while calling on readers to contact CEO Jeff Bezos to express their support of authors. Not long after, a second open letter, signed by over 1100 authors, was sent to Amazon's board of directors asking if they personally approved the policy of hindering the sale of certain books.\n\nDescribing the motivation behind the campaign, Preston explained: “This is about Amazon’s bullying tactics against authors. Every time they run into difficulty negotiating with a publisher, they target authors’ books for selective retaliation. The authors who were first were from university presses and small presses... Amazon is going to be negotiating with publishers forever. Are they really going to target authors every time they run into a problem with a publisher?”\n\nIn 2015, Preston took part in an expedition into the Mosquitia mountains of Honduras that penetrated one of the last scientifically unexplored areas on the surface of the earth. The expedition, led by Steve Elkins and sponsored by Benenson Productions, the Honduran government, and \"National Geographic\" magazine, explored a previously unknown pre-Columbian city built by a mysterious civilization that had been influenced by the Maya, but was not Maya itself. The city was discovered in an area long rumored to contain a legendary “lost city” known as La Ciudad Blanca, the White City, or the Lost City of the Monkey God. The extensive archaeological site, in a remote valley ringed by mountains, had been discovered in 2012 in an aerial overflight by a team using the powerful technology of lidar (Light Detection and Ranging), able to map the terrain under dense, triple-canopy jungle.\n\nThe 2015 expedition explored and mapped the city’s plazas, pyramids, and temples. It also discovered a cache of stone sculptures at the base of the city’s central earthen pyramid. When excavated in 2016 and 2017, the cache revealed over 500 sacred objects which appeared to have been ceremonially broken and left as an offering at the time the city was abandoned. Preston wrote about that discovery in his 2017 nonfiction book, \"The Lost City of the Monkey God: A True Story\", which became a #1 New York Times bestseller. Preston was one of many on the expedition who contracted an aggressive parasitic disease, called mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, in the lost city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This was to develop the physics, collision and A.I. for the game. Sony had an extensive reference library for the tracks including aerial photographs, close-ups of the tracks and over 200 hours of race footage from F1 Digital+. The PlayStation 2 graphical capabilities allowed the team to include more detail such as trackside details which were previously omitted and unique cockpit camera angles.\n\nStudio Liverpool managed to contact Formula One Administration who provided audio samples for all the cars. However, some of the audio samples provided were believed to be unsuitable. To rectify this, the developers spoke to Jordan and Prost and Sound Engineer Michael de Belle visited the garages to record the engine noises from the cars. The original PlayStation's central processing unit was used for sound processing.\n\nAt the 2001 United States Grand Prix, Sony held a variety of sport promotions with Jenson Button and a multi-million advertising campaign. The advertising efforts in the United States included a national television campaign via network, cable and syndication sports programming. Promotions in print spreads and online advertising were also used.\n\nA Formula One 2001 American Challenge was held on 29 September 2001 in Castleton, Indiana. The event saw a time trial competition using the game and was played by Jenson Button against consumer Chris Ohanian. Ohanian made it into the final round by scoring one of the top 2 times but in the final, he was defeated by Button who set a lap time of 1:15.6 compared to Ohanian's 1:16.0.\n\nThe game features all the drivers and tracks from the 2001 Formula One World Championship, although Tarso Marques' name is never mentioned by Murray Walker. Instead on the PS1 version, Murray Walker calls him 'Minardi', however on the PS2 version nothing is mentioned. Depending on which version the player has, some of the replacement drivers that appeared in the real 2001 Formula One World Championship are in the game, however drivers such as Ricardo Zonta, Alex Yoong and Tomáš Enge are not featured.\n\nIn the European version of the game, released earlier in the year, Jean Alesi can be seen driving for the Prost Grand Prix team while German driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen drives for the Jordan Grand Prix. In the American version, released on September of the same year, both drivers have switched roles as they also did in real life. On top of this, in the European version Luciano Burti drives for Jaguar Racing, whilst Gastón Mazzacane drives for the Prost Grand Prix.

His long career led him to become one of Europe's leading opera stars. He also wrote a number of songs, of minor importance, although \"The Death of Nelson\" is still remembered. His success, and that of his offspring in marrying into the British aristocracy, are also notable examples of Jewish social mobility in the early 19th century.\n\nBraham's precise origins are uncertain. The favoured (but specious) present account in contemporary sources of reference is that he was possibly a son of John Abraham or Abrahams, who was possibly an operative at the Drury Lane Theatre who died in 1779 and his wife, who may have been Esther, who may have been a sister of the hazzan at the Great Synagogue of London, Myer Lyon. Braham has also been held to be related to various other London musicians with the surname of Abrahams. There is however no documentary evidence for any of these supposed connections.\n\nIt is however fairly certain that Braham was left an orphan at an early age. There are stories of his selling pencils in the street as an urchin (a common trade for the Jewish poor at the time). Braham was a \"meshorrer\" (descant singer) at the Great Synagogue, and here his abilities were noted by Lyon, who led a double life as an operatic tenor at the theatre at Covent Garden (under the name of Michaele Leoni).\n\nBraham's first stage appearance was in fact at Leoni's Covent Garden 1787 benefit, when he sang Thomas Arne's \"The soldier tir’d of war’s alarms\". He next appeared in June at the Royalty Theatre, again with Leoni.\n\nAfter 1788 however we do not hear of a public performance until Braham appeared at Bath under the aegis of his teacher, the male soprano Venanzio Rauzzini in 1794. This empty period will have coincided with the departure of Leoni and also with Braham's voice breaking. It also therefore suggests a birthdate of around 1774 or 1775, rather than the 1777 date given by nearly all modern sources. During this period he was supported by the Goldsmid family. The Goldsmids were influential financiers who maintained their friendship with Braham later in his career and also used him as entertainment at their soirées. Their neighbour and occasional guest there was Horatio Nelson, whose heroic fate was later to prompt Braham's greatest song-writing success, \"The Death of Nelson\". (It first appeared in the opera \"The Americans\", (Lyceum Theatre, 1811). Lady Hamilton, who was in a private box for the performance, was reported to have been so overcome that she suffered a fit of hysterics and had to leave the theatre).\n\nBraham was trained by Rauzzini from 1794 to 1796. It is very likely in fact that the Goldsmids paid for Braham to be articled to Rauzzini, who was a leader in Bath's musical society. After his first performance at Bath in 1794, the \"Bath Chronicle\" eulogised him as ‘a sweet singer of Israel’ and explained that he\n\n\"derived […] from the synagogue, though by the simple expedient of dropping the A at the beginning of his name, he got rid of the patriarchal appellation and Christianized himself.\"\n\nAt this point, despite the implications of the article, in fact Braham had made no moves to conversion, although he may well have attended church as social custom of the time required.\n\nRauzzini's pupils included the celebrated Irish tenor Michael Kelly, creator of Don Basilio in Mozart's \"Marriage of Figaro\". Braham certainly benefited from Rauzzini's influence and promotion, and acquired from him the basic precepts of the old Italian school and a virtuoso technique which was thought by some to be surpassed only by the soprano Angelica Catalani.\n\nThis 1794 performance also marked Braham's first encounter with the Storace family. Stephen Storace (1762–1796), the son of an Italian musician based in Dublin was an accomplished composer; and his sister Anna, known as Nancy (1765–1817), formerly also a student of Rauzzini, a talented soprano. They had already had much experience in Italy and in Vienna, where in 1786 Nancy created the first Susanna in Mozart's \"Figaro\", and both had been friends of the composer. In Vienna Nancy had contracted an unfortunate marriage with the psychopathic English composer John Abraham Fisher, from whom she soon separated. At Braham's début, which was the first of the season at Bath, Nancy also performed, as a soloist and in a duet with him. It was the starting-point of a liaison which was to last for over twenty years, during which Nancy bore Braham a son, Spencer.\n\nStephen invited Braham to take the lead role in his new opera \"Mahmoud\" in 1796; Braham triumphed at the première. Later that year he sang lead roles, also to acclaim, at the Italian Opera in London, an extraordinary attainment for a Briton. In 1797 he appeared in the role created for his mentor Leoni, as Carlos in Sheridan's \"The Duenna\" at Covent Garden. The long triumphant phase of Braham's career was launched, which in its early years saw him and Nancy singing in every major continental house as well as in Britain, to audiences which contained, in Paris (1797), Napoleon, in Livorno (1799), Nelson, and similar notables wherever else they appeared. Braham became the first English male singer to command a European reputation. In 1809 he sang in Dublin at the unheard of fee of 2000 guineas for fifteen concerts, an indisputable sign both of his fame and popularity, and of the growth of music and entertainment as industries in this period.\n\nHowever, both by his own choice and by the sentiments of his audiences in England, Braham's Jewishness remained a prominent feature of his career until his marriage in 1816, and as the most famous English Jew of this period he became a significant incarnation of 'the Jew' in the British consciousness. He also regularly supported Jewish charities and causes.\n\nBraham's physical appearance made it in any case difficult to disguise his origins, being short, stocky, swarthy and in general the epitome of a caricature Jew. The quality of his singing rendered his looks irrelevant to his audience; as was unpleasantly expressed by the satirist John Williams, who at the end of a long catalogue of supposed Jewish malpractices and some lubricious references to Braham's supposed venery, concludes his passage:\n\n\"His voice and his judgement completely atone\n\n\" For that heap of repulsion he cannot disown.\"\n\n\"[...] When he breathes his divisions and liquidly soars,\"\n\n\"Frigid Science first hears, then bows low and adores!\"\n\nThe writer and essayist Charles Lamb is effusive, if patronising, about Braham in a letter of 1808:\nDo you like Braham’s singing. The little Jew has bewitched me. I follow him like as the boys follow Tom the Piper. He cures me of melancholy as David cured Saul […]Braham’s singing when it is impassion’d is finer than Mrs. Siddons or Mr. Kemble's acting & when it is not impassion'd it [is] as good as hearing a person of fine sense talking. The brave little Jew!\n\nIn his published essays however Lamb, whilst continuing to profess admiration for Braham, lets his prejudices rip. His attitude does not differ much, in fact, from that of Williams already referred to, accepting Braham’s talents only in the context of supposed distasteful practices of his people. In his essay \"‘Imperfect Sympathies’\" published in 1821, he wrote:\n\nB–[raham] would have been more in keeping if he had abided by the faith of his forefathers. There is a fine scorn in his face, which nature meant to be of - Christians. The Hebrew spirit is strong in him, in spite of his proselytism. He cannot conquer the Shibboleth. How it breaks out, when he sings, \"The Children of Israel passed through the Red Sea!\" The auditors, for the moment, are as Egyptians to him, and he rides over our necks in triumph. There is no mistaking him. – B– has a strong expression of sense in his countenance, and it is confirmed by his singing. The foundation of his vocal excellence is use. He sings with understanding, as Kemble delivered dialogue. He would sing the Commandments, and give an appropriate character to each prohibition.\n\nLamb had earlier attacked Braham rather more personally, and at some length, in the essay \"The Religion of Actors\", not subsequently collected into the 'Elia' series.\nA celebrated performer has seen fit to oblige the world with a confession of his faith; or, Br–’s RELIGIO DRAMATICI. This gentleman, in his laudable attempt to shift from his person the obloquy of Judaism, with the forwardness of a new convert, in trying to prove too much, has, in the opinion of many, proved too little. A simple declaration of his Christianity was sufficient; but, strange to say, his apology has not a word about it. [….] We can do no less than congratulate the general state of Christendom upon the accession of so extraordinary a convert.\n\nIt is not known to what statement by Braham Lamb refers in this passage; no document or publication has been identified in which Braham writes of his religion. Nor, as Lamb hints, is there any evidence of Braham's actual conversion. However the passage is undoubtedly associated with Braham's marriage to (the Gentile) Miss Bolton of Manchester in 1816. This followed a traumatic period for Braham in which his personal affairs were often before the public. Having fallen out with, and abandoned, Nancy Storace, he had travelled to France in 1815 with a Mrs. Wright, whose husband sued him for criminal conversation (and eventually was awarded £1000). While the suit was pending, Braham had the unusual experience of being hissed during a performance of Handel's \"Israel in Egypt\" (the very piece cited by Lamb in his 1821 essay), on which he stepped forward and addressed the audience:\nI am now before you in a public character. If, in that situation, I have given you offence, you have an undoubted right to call for an apology or defence; but if I have erred as a private individual, the nature of that error cannot with discretion come under your notice. It will probably be investigated by a court, constituted to hear both the accuser and the accused, and where justice only can be done.\nLamb clearly carried some baggage regarding Judaism which was not shared by (or at least not as evident in) most other writers of the time; on the three occasions he mentions Braham the latter's Jewish origin is always prominent. Lamb's friend Leigh Hunt admittedly takes the opportunity for some snide comments in his memories of Braham from the retrospect of 1850, when\nfrom [the] wonderful remains of power in his old age we may judge what he must have been in his prime. […]He had wonderful execution as well as force, and his voice could also be very sweet, though it was too apt to betray something of the nasal tone which has been observed in Jews, and which is, perhaps […] a habit in which they have been brought up […] it might not be difficult to trace it to moral, and even to monied, causes; those, to wit, that induce people to retreat inwardly upon themselves; into a sense of their shrewdness and resources; and to clap their finger in self-congratulation upon the organ through which it pleases them occasionally to intimate as much to a bystander, not choosing to trust it wholly to the mouth.\n\nOther writers, such as Crabb Robinson or Mount Edgcumbe, mention Braham frequently without reference to his religion. Robinson writes in 1811:\nHis trills, shakes and quavers are, like those of all the other great singers, tiresome to me; but his pure melody, the simple song clearly articulated, is equal to anything I ever heard. His song was acted as well as sung delightfully; I think Braham a fine actor while singing; he throws his soul into his throat, but his whole frame is animated, and his gestures and looks are equally impassioned.\n\nMount Edgcumbe, in his memoirs, discriminates Braham's styles more closely:\nAll must acknowledge that his voice is of the finest quality […] he has great knowledge of music and can sing extremely well. It is therefore the more to be regretted that he should ever do otherwise, that he should ever quit the normal register of his voice by raising it to an unpleasant falsetto […], that he should depart from a good style and correct taste […] to adopt at times the over-florid and frittered Italian manner; at others, to fall into the coarseness and vulgarity of the English. The fact is, he can be two different singers according to the audience before whom he performs, and that to gain applause he condescends to sing as ill at the playhouse as he has done well at the opera.\n\nIn 1826 a writer in the \"Quarterly Musical Magazine and Review\", in a letter entitled 'Foreign Instruction and English Judgement', states:\nWe have no English male vocalist who is entitled to the character of impassioned but Braham […] I remember Braham before he went to Italy [i.e. before 1798]. He was bred in the Italian school, but though he sung with great feeling, he was young and exhibited more of what I would call instrumentation than mind before he went abroad.\n\nAll this is further evidence that Braham's singing showed similar traces of ‘otherness’ to that of Leoni, whose use of falsetto was also characteristic, and that this relic of Braham's early training was amongst the factors enabling him to present a singing style clearly demarcated, for the cognoscenti, from both the prevalent Italian and home-grown English styles.\n\nIt further indicates that Braham was very conscious of his market, more so than he was for the purity of his art. In this of course he was no different from his many Gentile colleagues, and Mount Edgcumbe deplores him for his betrayal of art, not for his origins. However similar arguments against other musicians of Jewish origin were however also later to be given specific anti-Jewish spins in continental Europe.\n\nFollowing his marriage, Braham seems to have brought to a close any overt identification with the Jewish community. We do not find after this date appearances at Jewish charities or functions. This withdrawal also follows the publication of Byron's and Nathan’s \"Hebrew Melodies\", to which he had lent his name (although he had no part in creating them) in return for a share of the profits. Despite the intention that Braham would publicise the songs there seems to be no record of his ever having performed them. His marriage, and the vehement anti-Jewish reviews which Byron's poetry received, may have both provided significant disincentives to do so. Although Nathan's first edition of the Melodies seems to have been profitable, Braham declined lending his name on the same terms to the second edition in 1824. Thus the year 1816 marks the turning of the tide as regards Braham's self-identification. Leigh Hunt, writing in 1850, gives an ironic indication of Braham's eventual Anglicization, dropping many of his Jewish mannerisms:\nByron would pleasantly pretend that Braham called 'enthusiasm' entoozy-moozy; and in the extraordinary combination of lightness, haste, indifference and fervour with which he would pitch out that single word from his lips, accompanied with a gesture to correspond, he would really set before you the admirable singer in one of his (then) characteristic passages of stage dialogue. He did not live to see Braham become an exception in his dialogue as in his singing.\n\nDespite the dip in public support when he broke with Storace, Braham's reputation remained strong until at least the mid-1820s, when he created in London the role of Huon in Weber’s opera, \"Oberon\" and sang in Mozart’s \"Requiem\" at Weber's funeral service not long afterwards (June 1826). In the 1830s critics began to dispute whether his voice still served, and he began to abandon tenor roles for baritone parts. Poor investments, including an unhappy venture into theatre management at the St. James's Theatre, which he built in 1835, meant that he was forced to continue to exploit his reputation long after his voice could justify it, at times retiring to the continent to avoid bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nIn 1840 he sang in Mendelssohn's \"Lobgesang\" (Second Symphony) at Birmingham under the composer's baton, and subsequently undertook a tour of America with his son Charles Braham. His last public performance was given in London in March 1852 (that is, when he was probably 78 years old) and he died there on 16 February 1856.\n\nHe also worked as a singing teacher. Two of his notable pupils included mezzo-soprano Adelaide Kemble and soprano Fanny Corri-Paltoni.\n\nBraham continued to be dogged by the aftermath of the Storace affair, most notably through the antipathy, (fuelled by personal enemies), of his son by Storace, Spencer. Spencer ended up, having taken the surname Meadowes, as a canon of Canterbury Cathedral.\n\nMost notable of his children was his eldest daughter Frances (1821–1879). In a sequence of four brilliant marriages she wed the eldest, but illegitimate, son of the 6th Earl Waldegrave; then his brother, the 7th Earl; the elderly, wealthy and well-connected politician George Harcourt (1785–1861); and, finally, the politically ambitious Chichester Fortescue, later Lord Carlingford. (Asked once on which day of the week she had been married, she allegedly replied 'Oh, my dear, I have been married nearly every day of the week'). Restoring, with Harcourt, Horace Walpole's Strawberry Hill estate, which she had inherited from the Waldegraves, she became one of the leading society and political hostesses of her era. Gladstone, Disraeli, the Prince and Princess of Wales and the Duc d'Aumale, youngest son of Louis-Philippe, were all frequent guests. She was also a friend and patroness of the nonsense pioneer, Edward Lear. Her wealth enabled her to bail out her father and her various siblings on sundry occasions.\n\nBut Frances's marriages were not the family's only social coup. Charles Braham's daughter Constance was married, with some help from her aunt, to Edward Strachey, later first Baron Strachie.\n\nThe social transformation that had been achieved within a generation, the foundation of which was Braham's reputation and achievement as a musician, is obvious.\n\nThe tenor Michael Kelly, who had a long professional association with Braham, remarked in 1826 that 'he is, decidedly, the greatest vocalist of his day.' John Braham became seen (retrospectively) as the founder of a dynasty of leading British tenors of the concert and oratorio stage. His immediate successor was the Englishman John Sims Reeves who sang into the 1880s. Reeves was succeeded by Edward Lloyd, who between 1874 and his retirement in 1900 took part in every Handel Triennial Festival at the Crystal Palace. Braham's 'Death of Nelson' remained in Lloyd's repertoire during the 1900s: in Lloyd's declamatory style, ringing but without much vibrato, there may be an echo of the stentorian style of Braham himself. In the early twentieth century the declamatory delivery in Handel's music was maintained by Walter Widdop and Joseph Hislop among others.\n\n"}

The 4.3 acre (1.7 hectare) Water Gardens were designed by noted New York architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee and were dedicated to the City of Fort Worth by the Amon G. Carter Foundation.\n\nThe urban park is frequently billed as a \"cooling oasis in the concrete jungle\" of downtown. Its focal points are three pools of water and a terraced knoll, which helps to shield the park from the rest of the City. Interstate 30 was relocated from its former site immediately adjacent to the Water Gardens, making the south end of the park quieter. The park now sits adjacent to Lancaster Avenue, recently landscaped and prepared for redevelopment.\n\nThe quiet, blue meditation pool is encircled with cypress trees and towering walls that are covered in thin plane of water that cascades almost 90 degrees down to the sunken blue water feature. The sound of the water on the walls evokes thoughts of a gentle rain shower. The aerating pool features multiple illuminated spray fountains under a canopy of large oak trees.\n\nThe main attraction of the Water Gardens is the active pool which has water cascading 38 feet (11 m) down terraces and steps into a small pool at the bottom. The active pool experience was built for people to be able to walk down the terraced steps to be surrounded by and experience the power, sounds and motion of water crashing around them.\n\nIn March 1991, Larry James Watkins, 43, of Greensboro N.C. was one of two people killed when the light pole toppled about 6 p.m. in gusty winds.

As a disclosure officer for the IRS's Greensboro district, his job was to make sure that taxpayer information remained confidential. \n\nLibby Watson, an assistant Fort Worth city manager, said Friday that investigators had not determined what caused the metal pole to snap at the base and fall. She said, though, that the wind may have contributed. ``I'm afraid it's too early to speculate' on the cause, she said. A South Carolina man also was killed by the falling pole.\n\nThe pole was one of six at Fort Worth Water Garden, a 4.3-acre multilevel concrete and stone park built in the downtown area in 1975.

The game also includes the new one-shot qualifying rules and points system introduced for the 2003 Formula One World Championship, as well as the alterations to the Hungaroring and Suzuka circuits.\n\nThere are eleven game modes available for single and multiplayer, including single-player arcade and simulation single race, time trial and championship modes, multiplayer for up to 4 players and a non-interactive spectator option. Online connectivity is not supported.\n\nThe game features all the drivers and tracks from the 2003 Formula One World Championship, but does not represent the replacement drivers that featured in the real 2003 Formula One World Championship, therefore Nicolas Kiesa, Zsolt Baumgartner, Marc Gené and Takuma Sato are not featured.\n\n\"Formula One 2003\" was announced in a press release from Sony Computer Entertainment on 16 June 2003 with a July release date. The game was the first \"Formula One\" series to have an exclusive license from the Formula One Administration (FOA), which is responsible for the commercial rights and promotion of the Formula One world championship. The exclusive license granted Sony Computer Entertainment the sole rights to the \"Formula One\" series for four years.\n\nThe game features 16 official Formula One circuits based on the 2003 Formula One World Championship.\n\n\nSimilar to the FIFA series, Formula One 2003 has different cover art depending on the region. David Coulthard's McLaren MP4-17D is used on the European/Global release. Fernando Alonso's Renault R23B was used on the Spanish release. Michael Schumacher's Ferrari F2003-GA is moved from the second car to the leading car for the Italian release. Heinz-Harald Frentzen's Sauber C22 is featured on the Swiss and Dutch releases.

He gave the game 8 out of 10. Brodie Gibbons of \"Futuregamez\" also praised the graphics but criticised the sound and replay value, scoring the game 77%. Writing in \"The Guardian\", Jack Schofield noted that the game did not offer a large improvement over its predecessor outside the rule changes, but concluded that it \"offers more than enough to keep casual gamers happy.\"\n\nAll alcohol and tobacco sponsors are censored.\n\n"}

ISL is Cisco's VLAN encapsulation protocol and is supported only on some Cisco equipment over the Fast and Gigabit Ethernet links. It is offered as an alternative to the IEEE 802.1Q standard, a widely used VLAN tagging protocol, although the use of ISL for new sites is deprecated by Cisco. \n\nWith ISL, an Ethernet frame is encapsulated with a header that transports VLAN IDs between switches and routers. With IEEE 802.1Q the tag is internal. This is a key advantage for IEEE 802.1Q as it means tagged frames can be sent over standard Ethernet links.\n\nISL does add overhead to the frame as a 26-byte header containing a 10-bit VLAN ID. In addition, a 4-byte CRC is appended to the end of each frame. This CRC is in addition to any frame checking that the Ethernet frame requires. The fields in an ISL header identify the frame as belonging to a particular VLAN.\n\nA VLAN ID is added only if the frame is forwarded out a port configured as a trunk link. If the frame is to be forwarded out a port configured as an access link, the ISL encapsulation is removed.\n\nThe size of an Ethernet encapsulated ISL frame can be expected to start from 94 bytes and increase up to 1548 bytes because of the overhead (additional fields) the protocol creates via encapsulation. ISL adds a 26-byte header (containing a 15-bit VLAN identifier) and a 4-byte CRC trailer to the frame. ISL functions at the data-link layer of the OSI model.\n\nAnother related Cisco protocol, \"Dynamic Inter-Switch Link Protocol\" (\"DISL\"), simplifies the creation of an ISL trunk from two interconnected Fast Ethernet devices. Fast EtherChannel technology enables aggregation of two full-duplex Fast Ethernet links for high-capacity backbone connections. DISL minimizes VLAN trunk configuration procedures because only one end of a link needs to be configured as a trunk.\n\n\n"}

Algeria High School in Dorado, Puerto Rico.\n\nIn 1995 he was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 31st round of the amateur draft and began his professional career with the Great Falls Dodgers in the Pioneer League. His progress through the minor leagues was slow and marred by injuries. After four years in the Rookie and Class A leagues, he suffered a shoulder injury in which prevented him from playing all season. He returned in , pitching at the AA level, with one inning for the AAA Albuquerque Dukes. In , he struggled in AAA after pitching well in AA. After six years of service in the minor leagues without promotion to the Majors, he became a free agent.\n\nFeliciano signed with the Cincinnati Reds for the season, but was traded to the New York Mets in August along with Brady Clark for Shawn Estes. On September 4, 2002, Feliciano made his Major League debut pitching two scoreless innings of relief against the Florida Marlins. In the three years following, he had mixed success with the Mets, being recalled from and optioned to the AAA Norfolk Tides several times in and .\n\nFeliciano spent the season with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks of the Japanese Pacific League.\n\nFeliciano returned to the Mets as a left-handed specialist for the and seasons. In 2008 and 2009, he operated in the bullpen as the Mets' primary situational left-hander.\n\nIn 2007, he recorded his first career big-league save against the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nIn 2008, he led the majors in games pitched, with 86. In 58 of those games, the greatest number in the majors, he recorded fewer than three outs. He also led the majors in days pitched on zero days rest, with 36.\n\nDue to his large number of appearances, he has been nicknamed \"Perpetual Pedro\" by Mets broadcaster Gary Cohen.\n\nIn 2010, he passed Hall of Famer Tom Seaver in games pitched for the Mets with 459 and is now second all time to John Franco.\n\nPedro lead the majors in appearances in 2008, 2009, and 2010. He has had the most appearances from 2007 to 2010. His 344 relief appearances over those four years, is a Major League Baseball record.\n\nIn January 2011, Feliciano signed a two-year deal worth approximately $8 million with the New York Yankees. Early in the 2011 season, Feliciano began to experience soreness in his left shoulder, and was placed on the disabled list. On April 25, orthopedist James Andrews recommended a six-week strengthening program for Feliciano. The Yankees front office revealed that the reason behind Feliciano's injury was that the Mets had overused him within the recent years. It was eventually revealed that Feliciano had a torn anterior capsule and rotator cuff in his left shoulder, which required surgery, and ended his 2011 season.\n\nFeliciano began the 2012 season on the 60-day disabled list in an effort to continue recovering from his shoulder surgery from the previous year. Late in the 2012 season between August and September, Feliciano was issued to rehab at the Double-A Trenton Thunder. Still, Feliciano failed to make an appearance with the Yankees for the entire 2012 year.

Both a critical and commercial success, \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that no song on \"Eat 'Em and Smile\" was as slick as any of the singles from Van Halen's \"5150\" album, (which featured Roth's replacement Sammy Hagar) and also opined that \"Eat 'Em and Smile\" was much more \"trashy fun\". Indeed, many of the reviews of \"Eat 'Em and Smile\" compared it directly with Van Halen's synth-heavy \"5150\", often favorably.\n\nThe extensive North American Eat 'Em and Smile Tour ran from mid-1986 through early 1987.\n\nWhile there’s no evidence of a direct link to Roth, the phrase ‘Eat ‘Em And Smile’ was part of a trademark registered in 1928 by the now-defunct Ward-Owsley Co candy company in Aberdeen, South Dakota. The trademark also included a racist caricature of a black man smiling.\n\nIn a nod to his hit solo EP, Roth included two lounge songs on \"Eat 'Em and Smile\", \"That's Life\" and \"I'm Easy\". Roth also included a cover of the '60s garage band classic, \"Tobacco Road\". Two of the album's original songs, however, became its biggest hits. \"Yankee Rose\", a tongue-in-cheek tribute to the Statue of Liberty, became an MTV and radio hit, rising into the \"Billboard\" Top 20. The would-be theme to Roth's then-planned movie, \"Goin' Crazy!\" also became an MTV staple while hovering near the middle of \"Billboard\"s Hot 100 during the early autumn of 1986.\n\nA version of \"Kids in Action\", originally by Kim Mitchell (of Max Webster), was also recorded for this album. However, due to time constraints, the song was not included on the release. Billy Sheehan was briefly a member of Max Webster, according to Kim Mitchell: \"He was in the band for about three weeks...[but] it didn’t work out. There were no hard feelings and he went on and did really well. I got a call from him one day and he goes 'Hey man I'm in the studio with David Lee Roth, Ted Templeman and Steve Vai and we're covering your tune \"Kids in Action\" and we need the words to the second verse'. I was shaking on the phone; this was right after Roth left Van Halen. Then at the last minute it got bumped off the record for \"Tobacco Road\", they thought they needed a cover. See there's those darn covers again.\" There is no known studio version of Roth's cover available to the public.\n\nThis is the first of two Roth albums to feature the duo of Steve Vai and Billy Sheehan on guitar and bass respectively. Throughout the album the two would often sync complicated bass lines together with the lead guitar parts, as on tracks such as \"Shyboy\" and \"Elephant Gun\". The album brought Steve Vai into the public eye as a contender with Edward Van Halen, the previous guitarist who worked with Roth. This album features some of Steve Vai's most prominent guitar work.\n\n\"Sonrisa Salvaje\" (literally \"Wild Smile\") is the Spanish-language version of \"Eat 'Em and Smile\". According to the Van Halen Encyclopedia, the idea to re-record the album in Spanish was the idea of bassist Billy Sheehan, who had read an article in a magazine which reported that over half the Mexican population was between the ages of 18–27, a prime record buying market. Roth re-cut all his vocals with the help of a Spanish tutor in the studio. He changed around some of the racier lyrics, so as not to offend the more conservative Spanish-speaking population. With the exception of the vocals, the basic music tracks are the same as the \"Eat 'Em and Smile\" version, with the only exception being \"Big Trouble\", which ends abruptly as opposed to fading out on the English version.\n\nAccording to Sheehan, the album wasn't well-received, with many people considering it \"gringo Spanish\". Any future Spanish-version ideas were dropped. \"Sonrisa Salvaje\" was originally released on vinyl and cassette, but deleted almost immediately; a CD version did not appear until 2007. All of the liner notes on the original release were written in Spanish, except for the copyright notice and the Dolby noise reduction information on the cassette version.\n\nDaniel Brogan of the \"Chicago Tribune\" found the album to be a \"manic spree\" where Steve Vai's \"stinging guitar work\" is the most appealing component. Terry Atkinson of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"And the Ted Templeman-produced \"Eat 'Em,\" which stands up well alongside the best Van Halen albums, features the Roth you know: rock's answer to those pop-eyed libidinous wolves of the old Tex Avery cartoons.\" \n\n\n\nAlbum\nSingles\n"}
{"id": "2194117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194117", "title": "Jacob Gade", "text": "Jacob Gade\n\nJacob Thune Hansen Gade (Vejle, Denmark, 29 November 1879 – 20 February 1963, Assens) was a Danish violinist and composer, mostly of orchestral popular music. He is remembered today for a single tune, the familiar \"Jalousie\", also known as \"Jalousie 'Tango Tzigane' \" and \"Tango Jalousie\".\n\nJacob Thune Hansen Gade was born in Vejle, Denmark on 29 November 1879 and died on 20 February 1963. He belonged to a family of musicians. His grandfather and his father used to go around the nearby villages to play at all kinds of parties. And it was natural that, from an early age, he also began to play and was another member of the musical group.\n\nHe was 9 when he made his debut as trumpeter. He might have been an attraction because only a year later he was invited to Copenhagen to become a soloist in the orchestra of the Tivoli Garden, a famous amusement park. It was only at age 12 when he began to study violin, firstly with his father and later with teachers of greater knowledge. Soon he evidenced his ambition, he wanted to be recognized and for that he decided to move to the capital.\n\nHe began to compose country music, polkas and similar rhythms. With a scarce capital he left hurrying up his fate. He dreamed of being an orchestra conductor, and of writing waltzes, by then he was convinced that it was the best music in the world. He had a hard time, at night, he used to sleep at the entrance of buildings, at the hall near the stairs.\n\nHe started to work at small cafeterias and, about two years later, when he was only 18, he began to be connected with people who summoned him to play at an operetta in Frederiksberg, the night center of entertainment at that time.\n\nA prolific composer, in 1900, for the first time a toast song of his was published titled “Der er sollys i modne druer” (There is sunshine in ripe grapes), with lyrics by his finder, Lorry Feilberg. It turned out a very popular song and, among others, it was sung by Elna From, a theater actress ten years older than he, who was his first love. Although they never married, he had three children with her. They separated in 1906 and two years later, in Christiania, then capital of Norway, he married another actress: Mimi Mikkelsen, with whom he lived until she died in 1951.\n\nHe joined several orchestras up to 1903 when he already led his own. He didn't change his orientation; he was creator and diffuser of danceable music. In 1909, the recognition he achieved by his work made him be hired by the famous Hotel Bristol, located in front of the main plaza of Copenhagen. In order enhance his musical knowledge he turned to maestro Max Schlüler, an important concert player. Gade was already 30 and was too old to become a concert instrumentalist of classical music. Some time before, because of the same reason he had not been accepted in the Royal Conservatory of Danish Music.\n\nIn 1914 he began to lead orchestras that played at theaters and as well at the most important cinema theaters as accompaniment to silent films. At the same time he performed a series of concerts as soloist including a Paganini's composition. As composer he was in a period when he wrote waltzes with a title in French. He adopted several pseudonyms like Maurice Ribot, Leon Bonnard, James Wellington, Fred Marshall and Jascha Tjenko. He used to say that they made him widely known and provided him with an international touch. The principal paper of the city mentioned him as the king of waltz. His juvenile dream was coming true.\n\nIn 1919 he traveled to New York, joined orchestras that played at cinema theaters, and put together aggregations that included up to 80 members and, soon he had another satisfaction, he was chosen in a contest to join the Philharmonic Orchestra of New York. For two years he only devoted to playing classical music.\n\nHe returned to his country to conduct the orchestra of the Palads Cinema theater and to compose and arrange music to be played during the projection of movies. By that time he composed “Jalousie”. They say that its title had inspired the melody. He was on leave in Christiania, near a windmill far from the city, when he read on a paper that a man had murdered his wife because of jealousy.\n\nHis golden period lasted until 1929 when sound films arrived. But it scarcely affected him. In 1931 he opened the National Scala theater, and there he continued to play entertainment music for dancing. His career as orchestra leader and player before public audiences ended by his own decision.\n\nHis tzigane tango “Jalousie” was a worldwide hit. Performed for the first time on Monday 14 September 1925 at the premiere of the American movie Don Q. Son of Zorro, starring Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Astor, it placed Denmark in the world map of music. His royalties as composer were so ample that in the 70s it was estimated that the song was played, at least, once every minute on some radio of the planet.\n\nAfter “Jalousie” he devoted solely to musical composition, retired and based in a country house. There, among others, were born “Rhapsodietta” and another tango “Romanesca” which were published in Copenhagen and in Paris. He returned to the United States of America in 1939 where they offered to publish his whole output.\n\nOn 8 April 1940 he returned to his country. The following day the Nazis invaded Denmark. He endured it by settling on the Fiskerleje island where he continued composing. There a successful waltz was born: “Capricious”. Also other tangos: “El matador”, “Tango charmeuse”, “Lille Mary Anne”, “Laila” and “Tango Glamour”.\n\n“Jalousie” was born as an instrumental, but later in every country a lyric was written, according to their taste and commercial preference. This is the case of the above-mentioned Vera Bloom for the previously cited Frankie Laine. In Finland a lyric written by Kuliervo is known. In Great Britain, the then famous orchestra led by Gerald Bright presented his vocalist Monterrey (his true name was Montgomery) singing a lyric by E. Way and so appeared many others of the kind.\n\nIn our country its instrumental form was always respected. We highlight the renditions of the Sexteto Mayor; Nito Farace's who made an original delicate arrangement featuring the soloist Simón Bajour on violin; Osvaldo Requena's with Fernando Suárez Paz on violin; Francisco Lomuto's and Florindo Sassone's which has a good tango flavor but the violin is hardly heard. The piece possesses beauty because of its violin solos, without them the number is deprived of its charm.\n\nThe boom of “Jalousie” stirred up a legal conflict with the Danish publishing house Wilhelm Hansen to which Gade had granted the royalties of all the pieces he would compose until a certain date. The composer did not stick to what was agreed and published “Jalousie” by his own publishing house, Gade & Warny, thinking that the contract had expired, on the same day of the above-mentioned premiere. The issue was solved after Gade yielded a part of his royalties.\n\nThe number was included totally or partially in over 100 movies, in numerous television series and on all new ways of playing back since records appeared.\n\nWhen he drew up his will in 1956, he included his wish that all his estate and future royalties were granted to a foundation that had to be created under his name to sponsor young talented musicians. Explaining that reason, he said: «I still remember the financial and educational difficulties I had when I was young, when I arrived in Copenhagen with the purpose of making a living with music».\n\nWith his will he opened a bank account with the deposit of 100,000.00 DDK. In 1993 the publishing house founded by Gade sued Hansen's for the huge figures that the latter collected as royalties from “Jalousie”, but the court passed judgment against the former. Agreements had to be respected.\n\nEvery year the foundation holds a contest for young violinists in Gade's hometown. On 8 November 1970 a postage stamp commemorating the centenary of his birth was issued.\n\nThere is a peculiar arrangement of “Jealousy” for a woodwind quintet which was premiered on the celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the accession to the throne of the queen Margaret of Denmark, in the Elsinore Castle in June 1992.\n\nIn 1998 Dacapo Recordings published a record with a part of his works—some unpublished—, performed by the Odense Symphonic Orchestra conducted by Mathias Aeschbacher featuring the soloist Bjarne Hansen on violin. Critics commented: «It is incredible that an unknown and so good music has been displayed because of the popularity of “Jealousy”».\n\nWritten to accompany the silent era blockbuster \"Son of Zorro\" when Gade was leader of the orchestra of the Palads Cinema, the tango premiered on 14 September 1925 and was an instant international hit. When talkies were introduced it was featured in numerous films. \n\nThe royalties allowed Gade to devote himself to composition full-time for the rest of his life. Arthur Fiedler made the first recording of the piece with the Boston Pops in 1935, further increasing Gade's income. The royalties now fund a foundation for young musicians.\n\nAs a symphony composer Gade did not fare as well. In an interview two years before his death, Fiedler recalled that Gade came especially to Boston to thank him for the recording. Gade also presented Fiedler with a score of a symphony which Fiedler recalled as \"one of the worst pieces of music I ever looked at\".\n\n"}

Franz stated the request for his resignation and his subsequent disfellowshipping resulted from allegations of apostasy. Following his removal, Franz wrote two books that related his personal experiences with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and his views on Jehovah's Witnesses teachings.\n\nFranz was born in 1922. His uncle, Frederick Franz, was influential in the denomination's development, practices and doctrines. His father associated with the Bible Student movement (from which Jehovah's Witnesses developed) and was baptized in 1913. Raymond joined the Jehovah's Witnesses in 1938, and became a baptized member in 1939. \n\nIn 1944 Franz graduated from Gilead, the group's school for training missionaries, and temporarily served the organization as a traveling representative in the continental United States until receiving a missionary assignment to Puerto Rico in 1946. Franz became a representative of Jehovah's Witnesses throughout the Caribbean, traveling to the Virgin Islands and the Dominican Republic, until at least 1957 when Jehovah's Witnesses were banned in the Dominican Republic by dictator Rafael Trujillo. At the age of 37, Franz married his wife, Cynthia, who joined him on missionary work. Both returned to the Dominican Republic in 1961 to evangelize for four more years and were then assigned to Watch Tower headquarters in Brooklyn, New York. \n\nAccording to Franz, he began working in the organization's writing department and was assigned to collaboratively write \"Aid to Bible Understanding\", the first religious encyclopedia published by Jehovah's Witnesses. On October 20, 1971 he was appointed as a member of the Governing Body. In his personal memoir, Franz said that at the end of 1979 he reached a personal crossroad: \n\nFrustrated by what he viewed as the Governing Body's dogmatism and overemphasis on traditional views rather than reliance on the Bible in reaching doctrinal decisions, Franz and his wife decided in late 1979 they would leave the international headquarters.\n\nIn March 1980, Franz and his wife took a leave of absence from the world headquarters for health reasons and moved to Alabama, where he took up laboring work on a property owned by a fellow Witness. The following month, a committee of the Governing Body raised concerns about \"wrong teachings\" being spread by headquarters staff and began questioning staff about their beliefs. Staff were also questioned about comments Franz had made that may have contradicted Watch Tower doctrine. The March 15, 1980 issue of \"The Watchtower\" issued a statement of regret that its assertions of probability of Armageddon arriving before 1975 had \"apparently overshadowed the cautionary ones and contributed to a buildup of expectation already initiated.\" It told disappointed Jehovah's Witnesses, \"including \"persons having to do with the publication of the information\" that contributed to the buildup of hopes centred on that date\" to \"concentrate on adjusting his viewpoint\". This statement, which placed blame for the disappointment about 1975 on Raymond Franz as the former chairman of the writing committee, precipitated a purge of that committee. On May 8, 1980, Franz was told that he had been implicated as an apostate. He was called back to Brooklyn on May 20 for two days of questioning by the Chairman's Committee. According to Franz, the discussion involved allegations that some Witnesses were meeting privately to discuss various teachings of the Watch Tower Society that may have constituted apostasy.\n\nOn May 21, 1980, Franz was called to a Governing Body session where he was questioned for three hours about his biblical viewpoints and commitment to Watch Tower doctrines. Consequently, he agreed to a request to resign from the Governing Body and headquarters staff. Franz refused the Watch Tower Society's offer of a monthly stipend as a member of the \"Infirm Special Pioneers\". The Governing Body investigation resulted in the disfellowshipping of several other headquarters staff.\n\nOn September 1, 1980, the Governing Body distributed a letter to all Circuit and District overseers stating that apostates need not be promoting doctrines to be disfellowshipped. The letter stated that individuals who persisted in \"believing other doctrine despite scriptural reproof\" were also apostatizing and therefore warranted \"appropriate judicial action\".\n\nOn March 18, 1981 Franz' employer in Alabama submitted a letter of disassociation from Jehovah's Witnesses. The September 15, 1981 issue of \"The Watchtower\" announced a change of policy on disassociation, directing that those who formally withdrew from the group were to be shunned by Witnesses in the same manner as those who have been disfellowshipped. Franz, who continued to socialize with his employer, was summoned to a judicial hearing on November 25 and disfellowshipped for disobeying the edict. Determined to present his point of view, not only with respect to his having been disfellowshipped, but with respect to broader doctrinal issues, in 1982 he sent Heather and Gary Botting proofs of his book \"Crisis of Conscience\" so that they could chronicle the more widespread discord within the Watch Tower Society. They wrote regarding Franz' contribution to their exposé on the Witnesses that his recommendations \"undoubtedly strengthened the veracity of the text; we were impressed by his insistence on both fairness and frankness with respect to representing the view of the Watch Tower Society.\" After he was disfellowshipped, Franz published two books—\"Crisis of Conscience\" (1983) and \"In Search of Christian Freedom\" (1991)—presenting detailed accounts of his experiences as a Jehovah's Witness, a Governing Body member, and his experiences throughout various levels of the organization.\n\nOn May 30, 2010, at age 88, Franz fell and suffered a brain hemorrhage. He died on June 2, 2010.\n\n\n\n"}

Narrative inquiry uses field texts, such as stories, autobiography, journals, field notes, letters, conversations, interviews, family stories, photos (and other artifacts), and life experience, as the units of analysis to research and understand the way people create meaning in their lives as narratives.\n\nNarrative inquiry has been employed as a tool for analysis in the fields of cognitive science, organizational studies, knowledge theory, sociology, occupational science and education studies, among others. Other approaches include the development of quantitative methods and tools based on the large volume capture of fragmented anecdotal material, and that which is self signified or indexed at the point of capture. Narrative Inquiry challenges the philosophy behind quantitative/grounded data-gathering and questions the idea of “objective” data, however, it has been criticized for not being “theoretical enough.\"\n\nNarrative inquiry is a form of qualitative research, that emerged in the field of management science and later also developed in the field of knowledge management, which shares the sphere of Information Management. Thus Narrative Inquiry focuses on the organization of human knowledge more than merely the collection and processing of data. It also implies that knowledge itself is considered valuable and noteworthy even when known by only one person.\n\nKnowledge management was coined as a discipline in the early 1980s as a method of identifying, representing, sharing, and communicating knowledge. Knowledge management and Narrative Inquiry share the idea of Knowledge transfer, a theory which seeks to transfer unquantifiable elements of knowledge, including experience. Knowledge, if not communicated, becomes arguably useless, literally unused.\n\nPhilosopher Andy Clark speculates that the ways in which minds deal with narrative (second-hand information) and memory (first-hand perception) are cognitively indistinguishable. Narrative, then, becomes an effective and powerful method of transferring knowledge.\n\nNarrative is a powerful tool in the transfer, or sharing, of knowledge, one that is bound to cognitive issues of memory, constructed memory, and perceived memory. Jerome Bruner discusses this issue in his 1990 book, \"Acts of Meaning\", where he considers the narrative form as a non-neutral rhetorical account that aims at “illocutionary intentions,” or the desire to communicate meaning. This technique might be called “narrative” or defined as a particular branch of storytelling within the narrative method. Bruner’s approach places the narrative in time, to “assume an experience of time” rather than just making reference to historical time.\n\nThis narrative approach captures the emotion of the moment described, rendering the event active rather than passive, infused with the latent meaning being communicated by the teller. Two concepts are thus tied to narrative storytelling: memory and notions of time, both as time as found in the past and time as re-lived in the present.\n\nA narrative method accepts the idea that knowledge can be held in stories that can be relayed, stored, and retrieved.\n\n1. Develop a research question\n2. Select or produce raw data \n\n3. Organize data\n\n\n4. Interpret data\n\n\n\nThe idea of imagination is where narrative inquiry and storytelling converge within narrative methodologies. Within narrative inquiry, storytelling seeks to better understand the “why” behind human action. Story collecting as a form of narrative inquiry allows the research participants to put the data into their own words and reveal the latent “why” behind their assertions.\n\n“Interpretive research” is a form of field research methodology that also searches for the subjective \"why.\" Interpretive research, using methods such as those termed “storytelling” or “narrative inquiry,” does not attempt to predefine independent variables and dependent variables, but acknowledges context and seeks to “understand phenomena through the meanings that people assign to them.”\n\nTwo influential proponents of a narrative research model are Mark Johnson and Alasdair MacIntyre. In his work on experiential, embodied metaphors, Johnson encourages the researcher to challenge “how you see knowledge as embodied, embedded in a culture based on narrative unity,” the “construct of continuity in individual lives.”\n\nThe seven “functions of narrative work” as outlined by Riessman\n1. Narrative constitutes past experiences as it provides ways for individuals to make sense of the past. \n2. Narrators argue with stories.\n3. Persuading. Using rhetorical skill to position a statement to make it persuasive/to tell it how it “really” happened. To give it authenticity or ‘truth’.\n4. Engagement, keeping the audience in the dynamic relationship with the narrator. \n5. Entertainment.\n6. Stories can function to mislead an audience.\n7. Stories can mobilize others into action for progressive change.\n\nNarrative analysis therefore can be used to acquire a deeper understanding of the ways in which a few individuals organize and derive meaning from events \n. It can be particularly useful for studying the impact of social structures on an individual and how that relates to identity, intimate relationships, and family. For example:\n\n\n\n"}

The town consists mainly of facilities for the workers and companies that operate at the nearby Prudhoe Bay Oil Field. Deadhorse is accessible via the Dalton Highway from Fairbanks, south, or Deadhorse Airport. Limited accommodation is also available for tourists.\n\nThe permanent population is variously listed as being between 25 and 50 residents. Temporary residents (employed by various firms with local interests) can range as high as 3,000.\n\nCompanies with facilities in Deadhorse service Prudhoe Bay, nearby oil fields, and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), which brings oil from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez on the south-central Alaska coast. Facilities in Deadhorse are built entirely on man-made gravel pads and usually consist of pre-fabricated modules shipped to Deadhorse via barge or air cargo.\n\nThe Prudhoe Bay, Alaska area was developed to house personnel, provide support for drilling operations, and transport oil to the Alaskan pipeline. Prior to 1977, oil seeps (small pores or fissure networks through which liquid petroleum emerges at the surface of the land) on the Arctic coastal plain had caught the attention of the U.S. petroleum interests. The U.S. Navy drilled for oil between 1944 and 1953 with little success. However, in 1967, after several attempts at drilling for oil, oil company mergers, and competitive bidding for state lease sales, the Prudhoe Bay oil field was discovered.\n\nSources conflict on the origin of the area's name. The most cited theory appears to be that the area takes its name from a local business prominent in the late 1960s and 1970s, the \"Dead Horse Haulers\" trucking company. How the trucking company got its name remains in dispute.\n\nDeadhorse first appeared on the 1970 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It was made a census-designated place (CDP) in 1980. It appeared last on the 1990 census. After 2000, it was merged into the Prudhoe Bay CDP.\n\nTourists traveling to Deadhorse and Prudhoe Bay typically take tour buses from Fairbanks via the James Dalton Highway, a two-day journey with an overnight stop in Coldfoot. During the summer months, visitors can arrange for tours to the Arctic Ocean via a guided tour only. There is no longer any public Arctic Ocean access from Deadhorse. All tours must be booked 24 hours in advance to allow time for background checks on all passengers going through the oilfield check point. Tourists can also experience the midnight sun due to Deadhorse's location above the Arctic Circle. In winter, the opposite phenomenon, polar night, occurs.\n\nThe area often features large herds of caribou and over 200 bird and waterfowl species, including geese, swans, gulls and eagles. Other indigenous wildlife include Arctic foxes, Arctic ground squirrels, grizzly bears, polar bears, musk oxen, and Arctic hares.\n\nBecause alcoholic beverages are not sold in Deadhorse, a humorous slogan for the town is \"All that far and still no bar.\"\n\nThis is the beginning or end of an Iron Butt Association motorcycle rider challenge called \"The Ultimate Coast to Coast\". This ride starts from Key West, Florida, and gives riders 30 days to reach Deadhorse, Alaska. It is also the midpoint of the \"Haul Road 1000\" and the beginning or end of the \"Alaska Insanity Gold\" challenge (riders allotted 24 hours for those two challenges).\n\nDeadhorse features a borderline semi-arid-tundra climate (Köppen \"ET\"), as even the warmest month, July, has a daily average temperature of only [Although Deadhorse reaches an average of every 4 years, and there has never been a year where it didn't reach ]. The mean annual temperature is , with daytime temperatures reliably remaining below freezing from early/mid October to late April. As the area is located in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 2, temperatures below −40 °F/°C can be expected during the height of winter.\n\nDeadhorse (including Prudhoe Bay) is classified as an isolated town/Sub-Regional Center. It is found in EMS Region 6A in the North Slope Region. Emergency Services have limited highway, coastal, and airport access. Emergency service is provided by paid EMS service and Fairweather Deadhorse Medical Clinic (open daily and on call 24 hours a day [907-685-1800] for emergencies and urgent care). Auxiliary health care is provided by oil company medical staff and the Greater Prudhoe Bay Fire Dept. Individuals requiring hospital care are usually transported to the nearest hospital/medical center, Sammuel Simmonds Memorial Hospital, in Utqiagvik, Alaska. Because no roads connect Deadhorse to Utqiagvik, individuals are transported by plane or helicopter (an approximately 45 minute flight).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bernazard served as an assistant to Mets general manager Omar Minaya before being dismissed on July 27, 2009.\n\nDuring his ten-year major league career, Bernazard played second base, shortstop, and designated hitter for the Montreal Expos, Chicago White Sox, Seattle Mariners, Cleveland Indians, Oakland Athletics, and Detroit Tigers. He hit 75 home runs in 3700 at-bats with 523 runs, 177 doubles, 30 triples, 391 RBI, 113 stolen bases and 428 bases on balls. His career hitting line (BA/OBP/SLG) stands at .262/.339/.387.\n\nBernazard missed out on the Chicago White Sox divisional pennant run of 1983 when he was traded to the Mariners for second baseman Julio Cruz on June 15 of that year. The speedier Cruz helped spur the Sox to win the division by 20 games.\n\nIn 1984 with the Indians, he went through an 0 for 44 stretch at the plate, tying a major league hitless streak for non-pitchers in the last 50 years. He hit only .221 that year. He rebounded to have two productive seasons with the Indians batting .274 in 1985 and a career high .301 in 1986 while also hitting 17 home runs. Inexplicably, Topps pictured Bernazard as an American League All Star in its 1987 set (card number 607) though Bernazard was not named to the American League All Star Team in 1986, or any other season.\n\nFrom 1988–1990, he played for the Nankai/Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (now the Fukuoka Softbank Hawks) in the Japanese Pacific League. After a brief major league comeback in 1991 with the Tigers, in which he went 2-for-12 in six games, his career was over.\n\nBernazard became the vice president of development for the New York Mets in December 2004 after serving as a special assistant to general manager Omar Minaya.\n\nDuring the 2004 off-season, then-free agent first baseman Carlos Delgado was offended when Bernazard—a fellow Puerto Rican—attempted to gain an advantage in wooing Delgado to the Mets by utilizing what Delgado termed \"street Spanish.\" Delgado was heavily critical in public of the Mets negotiating tactics. He reportedly referred to Bernazard as \"the highest-paid translator on the planet\" after meeting him and Minaya for a face-to-face negotiating session at baseball's Winter Meetings. Bernazard, who was known for his flamboyant antics around the Mets offices and Shea Stadium, downplayed the incident.\n\nBernazard came under scrutiny again during the 2008 season, when it was reported that he was allegedly the person who orchestrated the firing of then Mets manager Willie Randolph. Bernazard came under renewed scrutiny in late July during the 2009 season after removing his shirt and challenging several Binghamton Mets players to fights. The same week Bernazard had another tirade at Citi Field when a Diamondbacks scout occupied a seat that he wanted and one of his deputies suggested to him that he wait until the end of the half inning, prompting Bernazard to become angry. In addition, Bernazard had an angry confrontation with Mets closer Francisco Rodríguez on the team bus, while returning to the team's hotel after an 11–0 loss to the Atlanta Braves.\n\nThe Mets organization issued a statement by general manager Minaya saying, in part, \"I spoke with Tony [Bernazard] this morning and informed him of my decision to terminate his employment with the Mets\", confirming an earlier report. At the press conference announcing the firing, Minaya angrily challenged the accuracy of past news reports, claiming that \"New York Daily News\" reporter Adam Rubin, who initially broke the story about Bernazard challenging Binghamton Mets players to a fight, was angling for a position in the Mets organization, a claim Rubin denied. Omar Minaya fired Bernazard from the Mets on Monday July 27, 2009.\n\nIn October 2009, Adam Rubin reported in his blog that Bernazard was close to joining the renowned sports agency Boras Corp., led by baseball super agent Scott Boras. Bernazard later denied this in an interview with FOX Sports' Ken Rosenthal. In the interview (dated April 27, 2010), Bernazard claimed that the media reports about his behavior were untrue. He also claimed that the Mets organization did not support him because the team needed a scapegoat for the 2009 season. As far as his career was concerned, Bernazard was not employed by a baseball team at that time, despite the fact that Bernazard claims he \"had some calls\" from unspecified sources at the end of December 2009. He additionally claimed that he \"[hasn't] been looking for a job.\"\n\n"}

Jind town is the administrative headquarters of the district. It is part of Hisar Division and was created in 1966.\n\nDuring the Sikh Empire, Jind lies in the heart of Haryana and is the fourth district of the Jat belt along with Sonipat, Rohtak and Hissar.\n\nThe district derives its name from its headquarters town Jind that is said to be derived from \"Jaintapuri\". It is also said that this town had been founded at the time of the Mahabharata. According to a legend, the Pandavas built a temple in honour of \"Jainti Devi\" (the goddess of victory), offered prayers for success, and then launched the battle with the Kauravas. The town grew up around the temple and was named Jaintapuri (Abode of Jainti Devi) which later on came to be known as Jind.\n\nRaja Gajpat Singh, a great-grandson of Phul, the founder of the Phulkian Misl, established an independent kingdom by seizing a large tract of the country, which included the territory occupied by the present district of Jind, from the Afghan governor Zain Khan in 1763 and created Jind city, the capital of the state in 1776. He built a fort here in 1775. Later, Sangrur was chosen as the capital of Jind State by Raja Sangat Singh (reigned 1822 to 1834).\n\nThe Raja of Jind is of the same family as the Maharaja of Patiala, being like him, descended from Mr. Phul.\n\nThe Originator of the Phulkian Dynasty, Phul left six sons, of whom Tiloka was the eldest, and from him are descended the families of Jind and Nabha.\n\nFrom Rama, the second son, sprang the greatest of the Phulkian houses, that of Patiala besides Bhadaur, Kot Duna and Malaudh.\n\nIn 1627 Phul founded and gave his name to a village which was an important town in the State of Nabha. His two elder sons founded Bhai Rupa while Rama also built Rampura Phul.\n\nPunjab history reveals that Jind was founded by descendants of Mr.Phool. Jind was a native state in Haryana. Jind was a state of Siddus founded by the grandson of Chaudhary Phul Singh.\n\nClaiming descent from Jaisal, founder of the State of Jaisalmer in 1156, the founder of this Sikh dynasty, Phul, was Chaudhary (Governor) of a country located at the southeast of Dihli. Phul's descendants founded 3 States: Patiala, Jind, and Nabha.\n\nTiloka had two sons namely, 1. Gurudutta 2. Sukh Chain. Sukh Chain's descendants ruled Jind state and Gurudatta's descendants ruled Nabha state.\n\nAfter independence, Jind State was merged with the Indian union and the territory of the present district became part of Sangrur district of Patiala and East Punjab States Union on 15 July 1948. At the time of its creation of Haryana state on 1 November 1966, Sangrur district was bifurcated and its Jind and Narwana tehsils were merged to form Jind district, one of the seven districts of the newly formed state. Jind tehsil was bifurcated to two tehsils: Jind and Safidon in 1966.\n\nThe district comprises three sub-divisions: Jind, Narwana and Safidon. Jind sub-division is further divided into three tehsils: Jind, Julana and Alewa (sub-tehsil). Narwana sub-division is further divided into two tehsils: Narwana and Uchana (sub-tehsil), and Safidon sub-division is also divided into two tehsils: Safidon and Pillu-Khera (sub-tehsil).\n\nThere are five Vidhan Sabha constituencies in this district: Jind, Julana, Safidon, Uchana Kalan and Narwana. Jind, Julana and Safidon are part of Sonipat Lok Sabha constituency. Narwana and Uchana Kalan are part of Sirsa and Hisar Lok Sabha constituencies respectively.\n\nJind town, the administrative headquarters, has an Arjun stadium, milk plant, cattle feed plant, and a large grain market. There are facilities for stay at PWD rest house, canal rest house, and market committee rest house. The town is well provided with schools, colleges, hospitals, and other basic amenities. Jind is noted for its numerous temples sacred to the worship of Shiva. Tradition assigns the settlement of the town to the Mahabharat period. Rani Talab is the major tourist attraction and Pandu-Pidara and Ramrai are the main devotional places attracting devotees for Amaavas bath.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census Jind district has a population of 1,334,152, roughly equal to the nation of Mauritius or the US state of Maine. This gives it a ranking of 364th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 11.95%.

Orion Television, then-owners of the \"Hollywood Squares\" format rights, licensed the format to Goodson.\n\nThe show began with two new contestants playing a round of 1970s-style \"Match Game\" with a six-person panel consisting of Bauman and five other celebrities. The game-play format was the one used on the syndicated \"Match Game PM\"; Rayburn read a humorous fill-in-the-blank question, and each celebrity wrote down a response. The contestant in control answered verbally and scored one point for each celebrity he/she matched. Three rounds were played, with each contestant having one turn per round and matched celebrities not playing subsequent questions. The contestant with the higher final score advanced to play \"Hollywood Squares\", while the loser was eliminated.\n\nIn case of a tie, a modified version of the \"Match Game PM\" tiebreaker was used. As before, a Super Match-like question (example: \"_____, New Jersey\") was played. The difference was that instead of writing their answers on a card, the contestants were secretly shown four numbered answer choices (examples: \"Atlantic City\", \"Hoboken\", \"Newark\", \"Trenton\"). Each contestant chose one answer by number, after which Rayburn read the question to the panel and polled them, one at a time. The first contestant whose chosen answer matched any panel member won the game.\n\nThe \"Hollywood Squares\" half of the show pitted the \"Match Game\" winner against the previous day's champion.\n\nFor \"Squares\", three more celebrities joined the panel along with Rayburn, who took Bauman's seat at bottom left. A third tier of the panel set swung into place to accommodate the new panelists, and the celebrity who was already sitting in the top center seat for \"Match Game\" became the center square. As on the original \"Squares\", contestants took turns attempting to claim squares on a tic-tac-toe board. The contestant in control chose a celebrity, who was asked a question by Bauman. If the contestant correctly agreed or disagreed with the answer, he/she claimed that celebrity's square; a miss awarded it to the opponent. The first contestant to get three of his/her own symbol in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) or capture five squares won the game.\n\nThere were several differences in game play compared to the original \"Squares\". Here, the champion always played \"X\" and the opponent \"O\", regardless of the gender of the contestants. This has been the only version of \"Squares\" not to use the traditional \"Mr. X\" or \"M(r)s. Circle\" distinction. Each individual square earned was worth $25; the first game was worth $100, and the value increased by $100 for each subsequent game. No \"Secret Square\" was played in this version. Most questions asked were of the true/false or multiple choice variety.\n\nThe most significant rule change involved winning a game. On all versions of \"Squares\" before and since, if a contestant missed a question on a square that the opponent needed for a win, control would simply pass back to the opponent and they would have to earn the square on their own. This version of \"Squares\" eliminated that rule, enabling a contestant to win a game on an opponent's error.\n\nThe contestants played as many games as time allowed, with the champion starting the first game and the loser of each game starting the next one. When the final bell rang, the contestant in the lead became the day's champion and joined Rayburn on stage to play the Super Match bonus round. Both contestants kept any money they earned in this segment.\n\nIf the match ended in a tie, one final question was played with the star of one contestant's choosing. If the contestant agreed or disagreed correctly, he/she won the match; otherwise, the match went to the opponent.\n\nThe champion played for a grand prize of up to $30,000 in the Super Match, whose rules were nearly identical to the 1973–82 version of \"Match Game\", but with Bauman and all eight of the other celebrities as panelists.\n\nThe round began with the Audience Match, in which the champion tried to match one of the three most popular responses given by a previous studio audience to a short phrase such as \"Trading ______ .\" The champion was allowed to call on any three celebrities for help and was not bound to use any of their responses. $1,000 was awarded for matching the most popular response, with $500 and $250 for the second and third, respectively. If the champion failed to match any of these three responses, the round did not end as on previous versions of \"Match Game\"; rather, he/she was given $100.\n\nNext, in the Head-to-Head Match, the champion attempted to match against one celebrity of his/her choice; the Star Wheel was not used. Each celebrity held a secret multiplier number (four held 10's, four held 20's, one held a 30). The celebrity and champion were given another short phrase similar to the Audience Match, and the celebrity wrote down a response. The champion then stated an answer verbally; if it was an exact match to the written response, he/she won an additional cash prize equal to the Audience Match value multiplied by the celebrity's number. A champion could win up to $31,000 in a single Super Match, by scoring $1,000 in the Audience Match, choosing the celebrity with the 30, and making a successful Head-to-Head Match to win another $30,000.\n\nRegardless of the end result of the Super Match, the champion would return the next day to play \"Hollywood Squares\" against the next day's \"Match Game\" winner. Champions remained on the show until they either lost to a challenger or played the Super Match five times.\n\n\"The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour\" debuted on October 31, 1983 at 3:00 PM in the Eastern time zone (2:00 PM in the Central and Pacific time zones and 1:00 PM in the Mountain time zone) on NBC. Both \"Match Game\" and \"Hollywood Squares\" had been aired on NBC, with \"(The) Match Game\" (albeit with different rules) airing from 1962 to 1969 and \"(The) Hollywood Squares\" airing from 1966 to 1980.\n\nThe show's only regular panelists were the co-hosts; Bauman sat on the panel during \"Match Game\" and the Super Match, while Rayburn took his place during \"Hollywood Squares\". The most frequent semi-regular panelist was actress Nedra Volz, who appeared for nine weeks, followed closely by \"Mr. Smith\" star Leonard Frey and returning \"Match Game\" regular Charles Nelson Reilly, who each appeared for seven weeks. Several of the panelists were previously regulars or semi-regulars on \"Match Game\", including Fannie Flagg (who appeared four weeks), McLean Stevenson, Marcia Wallace, Fred Travalena and Bill Daily; Bauman himself, as Bowzer, had also previously appeared on \"Match Game\". George Gobel, who appeared one week, and Abby Dalton, who appeared two weeks, were the only \"Hollywood Squares\" regulars to ever appear on the program. \n\nFollowing the practice of both parent shows, the same group of eight celebrity guests appeared on an entire week of episodes. Five were introduced at the start of the episode to play \"Match Game\"; at the end of that segment, the remaining three emerged onstage for \"Hollywood Squares\". Aside from Rayburn and Bauman, the panelists rotated so that different groups of three played only \"Squares\" from one day to the next.\n\nCast members of other NBC series often appeared on the show. It was also a starting point for new, unknown, and up-and-coming stars who would go on to greater fame, such as Jay Leno and Arsenio Hall (both of which would become successes as late-night talk show hosts). Game show hosts also appeared on the show, including Bill Cullen, Bob Eubanks, Pat Sajak, Bill Rafferty, and Chuck Woolery (who promoted \"Scrabble\" during the week before it premiered). The cast of \"Leave It to Beaver\" was reunited for one week at the end of 1983, while a week in May 1984 featured NBC soap opera stars. Also, the cast of \"Too Close For Comfort\" and the cast of \"St. Elsewhere\" appeared in '84, as well as a special salute to the fifties.\n\nThe series went up against the highly-rated soap operas \"General Hospital\" and \"Guiding Light\" in its time slot. Near the end of its run, NBC announced plans to begin production of the Dobson Productions-created soap opera \"Santa Barbara\", which would result in the show's cancellation. The final episode of the series aired on July 27, 1984.\n\nOriginal \"Squares\" host Peter Marshall, in his autobiography, states that he expected to be asked to host the \"Hollywood Squares\" portion once he heard that they had secured Rayburn's participation, but he was never approached. He also admitted having some schadenfreude at the show's cancellation, saying: \"I kind of hate to admit that I was happy when it didn't even last one season.\"\n\nThis version was the last time to date that \"Hollywood Squares\" aired on a broadcast network; in 1986, a syndicated revival aired for three years with John Davidson as host. A further revival, hosted by Tom Bergeron, aired in syndication from 1998 to 2004. A hip hop-themed series based on the format, \"Hip Hop Squares\", aired on MTV2 in 2012, and was revived for VH1 in 2017. A fourth spinoff, this one pertaining to country music, \"Nashville Squares\", debuted on CMT in 2019. This was in addition to several parodies and one-offs of varying degrees of official endorsement; Howard Stern's version, \"Homeless Howiewood Squares\", for example, included Rayburn reprising his role as a regular panelist.\n\n\"Match Game\" did not return to the airwaves until a revival on ABC in 1990, with Ross Shafer as host. \"Match Game\" was again revived in 1998, hosted by Michael Burger. Each lasted one season. \"Match Game\" was used as one of the semifinal games in CBS' Summer 2006 airing of \"Game $how Marathon\" hosted by Ricki Lake; a version of the show produced in Canada aired for two seasons beginning in 2012, and a prime time version on ABC debuted in 2016 with Alec Baldwin as host.\n\nRayburn went on to host two more game shows: \"Break the Bank\" (from which he was fired after 13 weeks) and the short-lived game \"The Movie Masters\" for AMC from 1989 to 1990. Bauman, whose only other hosting credit was the concurrent \"The Pop 'N Rocker Game\", has not hosted another game show since.\n\nPrior to 2019, the program had never been re-broadcast due to cross-ownership issues between MGM (Orion’s successor and copyright owner for \"Hollywood Squares\" episodes produced until 1989), Fremantle (Goodson/Todman’s successor), CBS Television Distribution (a successor of King World, which acquired format rights only from Orion in 1991) and the distribution agents originally responsible for the original NBC run until Fremantle's digital multicast network, Buzzr, aired four episodes (the Tuesday-Friday shows of premiere week) on February 17, 2019. Buzzr also mentioned that they will be working on digitizing and cleaning up the original master tapes in order to get the show on their regular schedule later in the year. Fremantle noted that the addition was being done for two reasons: to increase the number of \"Match Game\" episodes available for the network to rerun, and to add some form of \"Hollywood Squares\" (which the network does not own; ViacomCBS' CBS Television Distribution unit is the current rightsholder to the show's format and episodes produced since 1998 and additionally MGM owns rights to \"Hollywood Squares\" episodes produced until 1989) onto the channel's lineup. Former host Bauman wrote on Twitter, \"Understand that this was the only completely honest version of Hwd Squares ever where no Squares were sitting there with the punch lines of the jokes in front of them.\" On September 12, 2019, it was reported that Buzzr's new primetime lineup would feature the show, starting September 30.\n\nThe theme of \"The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour\" was composed by Edd Kalehoff. The theme and the music played during the show's ticket plug are used as car and showcase cues on \"The Price Is Right\", as well as the 1986–89 version of \"Card Sharks\".\n\nA revamp of the theme, \"Lottery\", was used by WNEV-TV/WHDH-TV in Boston during the late 1980s and early 1990s as well as several local Illinois game shows; it can also be heard at the stage show \"The Price Is Right Live!\"\n\nThe theme was also used as a cue on the British version of \"The Price Is Right\" (more specifically \"The New Price Is Right\") hosted by Bob Warman, which briefly aired on Sky from 1989 until 1990.\n"}

{"id": "2194161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194161", "title": "Formula One 05", "text": "Formula One 05\n\nFormula One 05 is a racing video game developed by SCE Studio Liverpool and published by Sony Computer Entertainment exclusively for PlayStation 2. It is a sequel to the 2004 video game \"Formula One 04\" and was based on the 2005 Formula One World Championship.\n\nIt featured the 'Career Mode' concept from \"Formula One 04\", which allows players to work their way through the Formula One teams over the course of five years (albeit a repeat version of the 2005 Formula One World Championship each time). This game also supports \"EyeToy: Cameo\", allowing players to place their own face on a driver when creating their profile, but unlike \"F1 04\", though they cannot choose their own helmet at the start, the player assumes a white unmarked helmet and only later unlocks other colours and designs.\n\nPlayers start out testing for smaller teams (Minardi, Jordan and Red Bull Racing (Like in \"F1 04\", a generic car does exist, but it is only used in Time Attack mode)). Players then work their way up the grid throughout their 'career' through a mixture of good tests and impressive race performances. As before, consistently poor performances will lead to dismissal from the player's current team. There are also occasional 'shoot-out' tests against the team's second driver (or third driver, depending on the player's current status within the team), in which both drivers complete a set of five laps each and whoever has the fastest overall time (one time based on the fastest first, second and third sectors added together) then takes the race seat. Players can now also view trophies they have received from winning races and championships after each is won in Career Mode for the first time.\n\nAs with \"F1 04\", \"classic\" cars (like the Williams FW11) are unlocked once certain terms are fulfilled, such as winning a World Championship. Helmets for Career Mode are also unlocked, and there is also a hidden track (the Detroit street circuit which was used for Detroit Grand Prix and the Paul Ricard circuit in France()) available for Time Attack Mode. Notably, since this game was developed before the change in the qualifying regulations midway through the actual 2005 Formula One World Championship, this game runs the original \"aggregated times\" format from the early part of the actual 2005 Formula One World Championship in every race in Race Weekend, Championship and Career Mode. This game also has Net Play available. A notable credit is the opening video features the song \"Butterflies & Hurricanes\" from English alternative rock band Muse.\n\nThe game features all the drivers and tracks from the 2005 Formula One World Championship, but does not represent the replacement drivers that featured in the real 2005 Formula One World Championship, therefore Vitantonio Liuzzi, Alexander Wurz, Ricardo Zonta, Anthony Davidson, Pedro de la Rosa, Robert Doornbos and Antônio Pizzonia are not featured.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of all four sevens for a total of 28 out of 40.\n\nFor the first time in a number of years, the fans agreed that this was a massive improvement in the series and the shot in the arm it had so desperately needed. A lot of people had criticised Studio Liverpool for the lack of ambition and progress since the series appeared on the PS2 platform up to that point. With the release of \"Formula One 05\", people saw that great strides had been made by Studio Liverpool in terms of gameplay handling and AI.\n\nHowever, there were criticisms in terms of the AI being too easy on the most difficult of settings, and about the penalty system that had been introduced on \"Formula One 05\" which automatically reduced the revs during a penalty instead of the traditional \"drive-through\" penalties that previous games had seen. Overall though, the fans agreed that apart from these minor issues, Studio Liverpool had redeveloped the brand as a stepping stone for improvement for the inevitable release of the 2006 edition.\n"}
{"id": "2194169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194169", "title": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III", "text": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III is a 1993 American martial arts superhero comedy film written and directed by Stuart Gillard. Based on the fictional superhero team the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, it is the sequel to the film \"\" (1991) and is the final installment of the original trilogy. It was produced by Clearwater Holdings Ltd. and Golden Harvest. With the voices of Brian Tochi, Corey Feldman, Tim Kelleher, Robbie Rist, and James Murray. It was the last \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" film released by New Line Cinema and released on VHS along with Columbia TriStar Home Video. Like the previous film, it was internationally distributed by 20th Century Fox.\n\nThe creature effects were provided by the All Effects Company, rather than Jim Henson's Creature Shop, which acted as the providers for the previous films. Despite being a moderate box office success, it is the lowest rated entry in the series.\n\nIn 1603, in feudal Japan, a young man is being chased by four samurai on horseback. As they go into the woods, a mysterious woman emerges from the underbrush and watches closely. However, the samurai eventually capture and take the youth, revealed to be a prince named Kenshin, with them.\n\nIn the present, two years after the events of the previous film with the defeat of The Shredder and The Foot Clan, April O'Neil has been shopping at the flea market in preparation for her upcoming vacation. She brings her friends the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles gifts to cheer them up. Michelangelo is given an old lamp (the lampshade of which he wears as an impression of Elvis Presley in \"Blue Hawaii\"), Donatello is given a broken radio to fix, Leonardo is given a book on swords, and Raphael is to receive a fedora but, having stormed off earlier, he is never formally given it. For Splinter, she brings an ancient Japanese scepter.\n\nBack in the past, Kenshin is being scolded by his father, Lord Norinaga, for disgracing their family name, but Kenshin argues that his father's desire for war is the true disgrace. Their argument is interrupted by Walker, an English trader who has come to supply Norinaga with added manpower and firearms, and Kenshin leaves his father's presence to brood alone in a temple. There, he finds the same scepter and reads the inscription: \"Open Wide the Gates of Time\".\n\nIn the present, April is looking at the scepter and it begins to light up. She is then sent back in time, while Kenshin takes her place; each wears what the other did. Upon arrival, April is accused of being a witch, but Walker deduces she has no power and has April put in prison to suffer. Back in the present, Kenshin is highly distressed upon seeing the turtles and calls them \"kappa\". After learning from Kenshin of the situation, the turtles decide to go back in time to get April. However, according to Donatello's calculations, they have to do it within 60 hours, otherwise the scepter's power will disappear due to the space-time continuum being out of sync. They bring in Casey Jones to watch over the lair and use the scepter to warp through time. When doing so, the turtles are replaced by four of Norinaga's Honor Guards and are confused at their new surroundings.\n\nBack in time, the turtles awake on horseback and make a poor show of riding their steeds. During the confusion, Mikey (who is carrying the scepter) ends up riding off alone into the forest and gets ambushed by an unknown assailant. The others go to search for April at Norinaga's castle, where their identity as Honor Guards allows them cover in their search. After following Niles, one of Walker's thugs into the prison, the turtles rescue April and also free another prisoner named Whit (locked up for trying to start a mutiny against Walker, and who bears a striking resemblance to Casey), but their sloppy escape ends up leaving them all alone in the wilderness and without a clue where to go. Meanwhile, in the present, Kenshin is getting impatient and anticipates a fight from Casey. Casey instead introduces him and the Honor Guards to television hockey, which manages to calm them down for the time being.\n\nOut in the woods, the turtles, April, and Whit are again attacked, this time by villagers mistaking them for Norinaga's forces. The attack stops when Mitsu, leader of the rebellion against Lord Norinaga, unmasks Raphael and sees that he looks just like one of her prisoners. The turtles realize that she is talking about Mikey and accompany Mitsu to her village. When they arrive, the village is being burned down by Walker's men. As the turtles help the villagers save it, Mikey is let out by a pair of clueless soldiers and joins in the fight. Walker is forced to retreat, but the fire continues to burn and has trapped a young boy named Yoshi inside a house. Michelangelo saves Yoshi from the fire, then Leonardo helps him recover by performing CPR.\n\nAs Walker continues bargaining with Lord Norinaga over buying guns in exchange for gold, the turtles spend some time in the village. Donatello decides to have a replica scepter made so they can get back home, while Michaelangelo teaches some of the people about pizza and later tries to console Mitsu about Kenshin, whom she is in love with. Raphael also gets in touch with his sensitive side through the child Yoshi, and teaches Yoshi how to control his temper. Back in the present, the Honor Guards from the past are quickly adjusting to life in the 20th Century, and Casey decides to challenge them to a hockey game. To Casey's dismay, the Honor Guards think hockey is about beating up each other. Meanwhile, Kenshin and Splinter fear that the ninja turtles will not return home in time before their sixty hours are up.\n\nIn the past, the replica scepter is completed, but an argument between Michelangelo and Raphael ends up breaking it. To make matters worse, Mitsu informs them that Lord Norinaga has agreed to purchase Walker's guns and will attack the village in the morning. However, when Raphael sneaks off to visit Yoshi, he is surprised to find the original scepter in the child's possession. The turtles are overjoyed to see it but are angry at Mitsu for hiding it and essentially forcing them to fight her war. However, Mitsu's grandfather clarifies that it was \"his\" idea to have the turtles fight in her place.\n\nSuddenly, Whit betrays everybody and captures Mitsu, and the turtles return to Norinaga's palace to save her. After rescuing her, they are cornered by Norinaga and are made to fight waves of his soldiers. The turtles respond by freeing the prisoners in the palace, starting an all-out war on the palace grounds. After a while of fighting, Leo defeats Lord Norinaga in a heated sword duel, comedically finishing him by cutting his hair and then trapping him inside of a bell. Deciding to cut his losses, Walker takes the scepter and tries to escape to his boat. When cornered by the turtles at the dock, Walker throws the scepter into the air as a distraction. The turtles catch the scepter, while Whit (who reformed after Walker went back on a deal they had made) launches a fireball from a catapult at Walker and knocks him off the dock to his death.\n\nThe turtles are now ready to return to their own time, but Mikey says he would rather stay (in particular because he wanted to be with Mitsu). Raphael decides he wants to stay as well because he feels like the Turtles are appreciated in Japan unlike back home. The other turtles and April try to convince them otherwise until Kenshin activates the scepter and makes the decision harder. After a long debate (which included Mitsu telling Mikey to keep his promise about Kenshin returning to the past), Michelangelo reluctantly agrees to go home with his brothers, but just barely misses grabbing the scepter in time. The Honor Guards switch back with the Turtles (all except for Michelangelo). Fortunately, the last remaining Honor Guard Benkei activates the scepter and swaps places with Mikey just before the scepter burns out.\n\nIn the past, Norinaga admits surrender to Mitsu and Kenshin (who hand the scepter to him), and the two lovers share a tender reunion. Meanwhile, Michaelangelo is depressed over the thought of growing up, but Splinter cheers him up by performing the \"lampshade Elvis\" impression, and the rest of the turtles join in with a final dance number.\n\n\n\nRist and Tochi (who did the voices of Michelangelo and Leonardo, respectively) are the only 2 voice actors to voice the same character throughout all 3 live-action \"TMNT\" movies. Corey Feldman returned as the voice of Donatello, after being absent for the second movie.\n\n\n\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III\" debuted at number 1 at the U.S. box office with a gross of $12.4 million from 2,087 screens. The film grossed $42.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $12.2 internationally, giving a worldwide gross of $54.5 million. Although it made twice its production budget, returns were barely more than half that of the previous film and roughly one-quarter that of the first; thus, it was considered a disappointment. There would not be another live-action adaptation until the 2014 reboot.\n\nReviews for the film have been largely negative by critics. Based on a sample of 30 reviews, the film holds a 23% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus \"It's a case of one sequel too many for the heroes in a half shell, with a tired time-travel plot gimmick failing to save the franchise from rapidly diminishing returns.\" On Metacritic it has a score of 40 out of 100, based on reviews from 12 critics.\n\nMichael Wilmington of \"Los Angeles Times\" noted that distributors deliberately kept the film away from critics. Despite mild praise for the look of the film, Wilmington called the first film a fluke hit and called this third film \"sequel hell\". James Berardinelli gave it one out of four stars, citing that \"any adults accompanying their kids will have to invent new and interesting ways to stay awake. Not only is this movie aimed at young children, the script could have been written by them.\" \"TV Guide\" gave it two out of four stars and said in their review, \"If the time-travel gimmick has to be employed twice in a row then it's probably best to banish these characters to a retirement sewer\", when commenting about a possible future film invoking time travel.\n\nAs with both of the previous films, the British PG version was censored due to usage of forbidden weapons (Michelangelo's nunchaku). For these scenes, alternate material was used. The cuts were waived for the DVD release.\nThe German theatrical and video version was based on the censored UK cut; the DVD is uncut.\n\nThe film was released to VHS and Laserdisc in 1993.\n\nThe film has been released on DVD, and also two Blu-ray box sets with both of its predecessors.\n"}

World War II was a total war; homeland production became even more invaluable to both the Allied and Axis powers. Life on the home front during World War II was a significant part of the war effort for all participants and had a major impact on the outcome of the war. Governments became involved with new issues such as rationing, manpower allocation, home defense, evacuation in the face of air raids, and response to occupation by an enemy power. The morale and psychology of the people responded to leadership and propaganda. Typically women were mobilized to an unprecedented degree.\n\nAll of the powers used lessons from their experiences on the home front during World War I. Their success in mobilizing economic output was a major factor in supporting combat operations. Among morale-boosting activities that also benefited combat efforts, the home front engaged in a variety of scrap drives for materials crucial to the war effort such as metal, rubber, and rags. Such drived helped strengthen civilian morale and support for the war effort. Each country tried to suppress rumors, which typically were negative or defeatist.\n\nThe major powers devoted 50–61 percent of their total GDP to munitions production. The Allies produced about three times as much in munitions as the Axis powers.\n\nSource: Goldsmith data in Harrison (1988) p. 172\nSource: Jerome B Cohen, \"Japan's Economy in War and Reconstruction\" (1949) p 354\n\nThe Allies called themselves the \"United Nations\" (even before that organization formed in 1945), and pledged their support to the Atlantic Charter of 1941. The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war: no territorial aggrandizement; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people; restoration of self-government to those deprived of it; free access to raw materials; reduction of trade restrictions; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all; freedom from fear and want; freedom of the seas; and abandonment of the use of force, as well as the disarmament of aggressor nations.\n\nThe sudden German invasion of neutral Belgium in May 1940 led in a matter of 18 days to the collapse of the Belgian army; King Leopold obtained an armistice that involved direct German military administration. The King refused the government's demand that he flee with them to Britain; he remained as a puppet ruler under German control. The Belgian bureaucracy remained in place and generally cooperated with the German rulers. Two pro-German movements, the Flemish National Union comprising Flemish (Dutch-speaking) separatists and the Walloon (French-speaking) Rexists led by Léon Degrelle (1906–94), supported the invaders and encouraged their young men to volunteer for the German army. Small but active resistance movements, largely Communist, provided intelligence to the Allies. During the Holocaust in Belgium, the Nazis hunted down the 70,000 Jews living in Belgium, most of them refugees, and killed 29,000 of them.\n\nThe Germans expected to exploit Belgium's industrial resources to support their war machine. Their policies created severe shortages for the Belgian people, but shipped out far less than Germany had expected. They set up the \"Armaments Inspection Board\" in 1940 to relay munitions orders to factories; the Board came under the control of the German Minister of Armaments, Albert Speer in 1943, and had offices in industrial areas that were supposed to facilitate orders for materiél, and supervise production. However, factory production fell sharply after 1942. Although collaboration with the Nazis, especially among the Flemish, was evident in 1940, it soon faded in importance. Labor strikes and systematic sabotage slowed production, as did the emigration of workers to rural areas, Allied bombing, food shortages, and worker resentment of forced labor.\n\nThe Allies retook all of Belgium in September 1944 as the Germans retreated. They reappeared briefly during the hard fighting of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, but were finally expelled in January 1945. The London‐based government‐in‐exile returned, but had to confront the resistance movements that demanded radical political change.\n\nChina suffered the second highest number of casualties of the entire war. Civilians in the occupied territories had to endure many large-scale massacres, including that in Nanjing. In a few areas, Japanese forces also unleashed newly-developed biological weapons on Chinese civilians, leading to an estimated 200,000 dead. Tens of thousands died when Nationalist troops broke the levees of the Yangtze to stop the Japanese advance after the loss of the Chinese capital, Nanjing. Millions more Chinese died because of famine during the war.\n\nAt the end of the war Japan was bombed with two atomic bombs and surrendered. Japan had captured major coastal cities like Shanghai early in the war, cutting the rest of China off from its chief sources of finance and industry. Millions of Chinese moved to remote regions to avoid invasion. Cities like Kunming ballooned with new arrivals. Entire factories and universities were relocated to safe areas so society could still function. Japan replied with hundreds of air raids on the new capital of Chongqing.\n\nAlthough China received much aid from the United States, China did not have sufficient infrastructure to properly arm or even feed its military forces, let alone its civilians.\n\nChina was divided into three zones, with the Nationalists in the southwest and the Communists led by Mao Zedong (Mao) in control of much of the northwest. Coastal areas were occupied by the Japanese, and civilians were treated harshly; young men were drafted into a puppet Chinese army.\n\nAfter the stunningly quick defeat in June 1940, France was knocked out of the war; part of it, with its capital in Vichy, became an informal ally of the Germans. A powerful Resistance movement sprang up, as the Germans fortified the coast against an Allied invasion and occupied the northern half of the country. The Germans captured 2,000,000 French soldiers, and kept them as prisoners of war in camps inside of Germany for the duration of the war, using them as hostages to guarantee French cooperation. The Vichy French government cooperated closely with the Germans, sending food, machinery and workers to Germany. Several hundred thousand Frenchmen and women were forced to work in German factories, or volunteered to do so, as the French economy itself deteriorated. Nevertheless, there was a strong Resistance movement, with fierce anti-resistance activities carried out by the Nazis and the French police. Most Jews were rounded up by the Vichy police and handed over to the Germans, who sent them to death camps.\n\nThe two million French soldiers held as POWs and forced laborers in Germany throughout the war were not at risk of death in combat, but the anxieties of separation for their 800,000 wives were high. The government provided a modest allowance, but one in ten became prostitutes to support their families. Meanwhile, the Vichy regime promoted a highly traditional model of female roles. After the war, France gave women the vote and additional legal and political rights, although nothing on the scale of the enfranchisement that followed World War I.\n\nWomen suffered shortages of all varieties of consumer goods and the absence of the men in POW camps. The rationing system was stringent and very badly managed, leading to pronounced malnourishment, black markets and hostility to state management of the food supply. The Germans seized about 20% of the French food production, which caused severe disruption to the household economy of the French people. French farm production fell by half because of the lack of fuel, fertilizer and workers; even so, the Germans seized half the meat and 20% of the produce.\n\nSupply problems quickly affected French stores, which lacked most items. The government responded by rationing, but German officials set the policies and hunger prevailed, especially affecting young people in urban areas. In shops, the queues lengthened. Some people—including German soldiers who could take advantage of arbitrary exchange rates that favored Germany—benefited from the black market, where food was sold without coupons at very high prices. Farmers diverted meat to the black market, so there was much less for the open market. Counterfeit food coupons were also in circulation. Direct buying from farmers in the countryside and barter against cigarettes became common. These activities were strictly forbidden, and carried the risk of confiscation and fines. Food shortages were most acute in the large cities. Vitamin deficiencies and malnutrition were prevalent.\n\nAdvice about eating a healthier diet and home growing produce was distributed. Slogans like \"Digging for Victory\" and \"Make Do and Mend\" appeared on national posters and became a part of the war effort. The city environment made these efforts nearly negligible. In the more remote country villages, however, clandestine slaughtering, vegetable gardens and the availability of milk products permitted survival. The official ration provided starvation-level diets of 1,300 or fewer calories a day (5400 kJ), supplemented by home gardens and, especially, black market purchases.\n\nThe Dutch famine of 1944, known as the \"Hongerwinter\" (\"Hunger winter\") was a man-made famine imposed by Germany in the occupied western provinces during the winter of 1944–1945. A German blockade cut off food and fuel shipments from farm areas. A total of 4.5 million people were affected, of whom 18,000 died, despite an elaborate system of emergency soup kitchens.\n\nThe Nazi Hunger Plan was to kill the Jews of Poland quickly, and slowly to force the Poles to leave by threat of starvation, so that they could be replaced by German settlers. The Nazis coerced Poles to work in Germany by providing favorable food rations for families who had members working in the Reich. The ethnic German population in Poland (\"Volksdeutsche\") were given good rations and were allowed to shop for food in special stores. The German occupiers created a draconian system of food controls, including severe penalties for the omnipresent black market. There was a sharp increase in mortality due to the general malnutrition, and a decline in birth rates.\n\nBy mid 1941, the German minority in Poland received 2,613 calories (11,000 kJ) per day, while Poles received 699 and Jews in the ghetto 184. The Jewish ration fulfilled just 7.5% of their daily needs; Polish rations only 26%. Only the ration allocated to Germans provided the full required calorie intake.\n\nDistribution of food in Nazi occupied Poland as of December 1941\n\nAdditionally the Generalplan Ost of the Nazis, which envisioned the elimination of the Slavic population in the occupied territories and artificial famines-as proposed in the Hunger Plan, were to be used.\n\nOn September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, conquering it in three weeks, as the Soviets invaded the eastern areas. During the German occupation, there were two distinct civilian uprisings in Warsaw, one in 1943, the other in 1944. The first took place in a zone less than two square miles (5 km) in area, which the Germans had carved out of the city and called \"Ghetto Warschau\". The Germans built high walls around the ghetto, and crowded 550,000 Polish Jews into it, many from the Polish provinces. At first, people were allowed to enter and leave the ghetto, but soon its border became an \"iron curtain\".\n\nUnless on official business, Jews could not leave, and non-Jews, including Germans, could not enter. Entry points were guarded by German soldiers. Because of extreme conditions and hunger, mortality in the ghetto was high. In 1942, the Germans moved 400,000 ghetto residents to Treblinka where they were gassed on arrival. By April 19, 1943, when the Ghetto Uprising commenced, the population of the ghetto had dwindled to 60,000 individuals. In the following three weeks, virtually all died as the Germans fought and systematically destroyed the buildings in the ghetto.\n\nThe uprising by Poles began on August 1, 1944, when the Polish underground, the \"Home Army\", aware that the Soviet Army had reached the eastern bank of the Vistula, sought to liberate Warsaw much as the French resistance had liberated Paris a few weeks earlier. Joseph Stalin had his own group of Communist leaders for the new Poland and did not want the Home Army or its leaders (based in London) to control Warsaw. So he halted the Soviet offensive and gave the Germans free rein to suppress it. During the ensuing 63 days, 250,000 Poles of the Home Army surrendered to the Germans. After the Germans forced all the surviving population to leave the city, Hitler ordered that any buildings left standing be dynamited – 98 percent of the buildings in Warsaw were destroyed.\n\nDuring the invasion of the Soviet Union in the early months of the war, rapid German advances almost captured the cities of Moscow and Leningrad. The bulk of Soviet industry which could not be evacuated was either destroyed or lost due to German occupation. Agricultural production was interrupted, with grain crops left standing in the fields. This caused hunger reminiscent of the early 1930s. In one of the greatest feats of war logistics, factories were evacuated on an enormous scale, with 1,523 factories dismantled and shipped eastwards along four principal routes to the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Ural, and Siberia. In general, the tools, dies and production technology were moved, along with the blueprints and their management, engineering staffs and skilled labor.\n\nThe whole of the Soviet Union become dedicated to the war effort. The people of the Soviet Union were probably better prepared than any other nation involved in World War II to endure the material hardships of the war – primarily because they were so used to shortages and economic crisis in the past, especially during wartime—World War I had brought similar restrictions on food. Conditions were nevertheless severe. World War II was especially devastating to citizens of the USSR because it was fought on Soviet territory and caused massive destruction. In Leningrad, under German siege, over a million people died of starvation and disease. Many factory workers were teenagers, women and old people.\n\nThe government implemented rationing in 1941 and first applied it to bread, flour, cereal, pasta, butter, margarine, vegetable oil, meat, fish, sugar and confectionery all across the country. The rations remained largely stable in other places during the war. Off-ration food was often so expensive that it could not add substantially to a citizen's food supply unless they were especially well-paid. Peasants received no rations and had to make do with any local resources they farmed themselves. Most rural peasants struggled and lived in unbearable poverty, but others sold their surplus food at a high price; a few became rouble millionaires, until a currency reform two years after the end of the war wiped out their wealth.\n\nDespite harsh conditions, the war led to a spike in Soviet nationalism and unity. Soviet propaganda toned down extreme Communist rhetoric of the past as the people now rallied to protect their Motherland against the evils of the German invaders. Ethnic minorities thought to be collaborators were forced into exile. Religion, which was previously shunned, became a part of a Communist Party propaganda campaign to mobilize religious people.\n\nSoviet society changed drastically during the war. There was a burst of marriages in June and July 1941 between people about to be separated by the war, and in the next few years the marriage rate dropped off steeply, with the birth rate following shortly thereafter to only about half of what it would have been in peacetime. For this reason mothers with several children during the war received substantial honors and money benefits if they had several children—mothers could earn around 1,300 rubles for having their fourth child and up to 5,000 rubles for their tenth.\n\nThe city of Leningrad endured more suffering and hardships than any other city in the Soviet Union during World War II. Hunger, malnutrition, disease, starvation, and even cannibalism became common during the siege, which lasted from September 1941 until January 1944. Many people lost weight, and grew weaker and more vulnerable to disease. If malnutrition persisted for long enough, its effects were irreversible. People's feelings of loyalty disappeared if they got hungry enough; they would steal from their closest family members in order to survive.\n\nOnly some of the citizens of Leningrad survived. Only 400,000 were evacuated before the siege began; this left 2.5 million in Leningrad, including 400,000 children. Subsequently, more managed to escape; especially when the nearby Lake Ladoga froze over and people could walk over the ice road—or \"road of life\"—to safety. Those in influential political or social positions used their connections to other elites to leave Leningrad both before and after the siege began. Some factory owners even looted state funds to secure transport out of the city during the first summer of the war. The most risky means of escape, however, was to defect to the enemy and hope to avoid governmental punishment.\n\nMost survival strategies during the siege, though, involved staying within the city and facing the problems through resourcefulness or luck: for instance by securing factory employment, because many factories became autonomous and possessed more of the requirements for survival during the winter, such as food and heat. Workers received larger rations than other civilians, and factories were likely to have electricity if they produced vital goods. Factories also served as mutual support centers, and had clinics and other services like cleaning crews and teams of women who would sew and repair clothes. Factory employees were still driven to desperation on occasion and people resorted to eating glue or horsemeat in factories where food was scarce, but factory employment was the most consistently successful method of survival, and at some food production plants not a single person died.\n\nSurvival opportunities open to the wider Soviet community included barter and farming on private land. Black markets thrived as private barter and trade became more common, especially between soldiers and civilians. Soldiers, who had more food to spare, were eager to trade with civilians who had extra warm clothes to exchange. Planting vegetable gardens in the spring became popular, primarily because citizens could keep everything grown on their own plots. The campaign also had a potent psychological effect and boosted morale, a survival component almost as crucial as bread.\n\nMany of the most desperate Soviet citizens turned to crime to support themselves. Most common was the theft of food and of ration cards; this could prove fatal for a malnourished person if their card was stolen more than a day or two before a new card was issued. For these reasons, the stealing of food was severely punished and a person could be shot for as little as stealing a loaf of bread. More serious crimes such as murder and cannibalism also occurred, and special police squads were set up to combat these crimes, though by the end of the siege, roughly 1,500 had been arrested for cannibalism.\n\nIn the United States, farming and other production was increased. For example, citizens were encouraged to plant \"victory gardens\", personal farms that children sometimes worked on. Sociologist Alecea Standlee (2010) argues that during the war the traditional gender division of labor changed somewhat, as the \"home\" or domestic female sphere expanded to include the \"home front\"; meanwhile the public sphere—the male domain—was redefined as the international stage of military action.\n\nThe Philippines was an American possession on the way to independence (scheduled in 1946) and controlled its own internal affairs. The Japanese invaded and quickly conquered the islands in early 1942. The Japanese military authorities immediately began organizing a new government structure in the Philippines and established the Philippine Executive Commission. They initially organized a Council of State, through which they directed civil affairs until October 1943, when they declared the Philippines an independent republic. The Japanese-sponsored Second Philippine Republic headed by President José P. Laurel proved to be ineffective and unpopular as Japan maintained very tight controls.\n\nJapanese occupation of the Philippines was opposed by large-scale underground and guerrilla activity. The Philippine Army, as well as remnants of the U.S. Army Forces Far East continued to fight the Japanese in a guerrilla war. They formed an auxiliary unit of the United States Army. Their effectiveness was such that by the end of the war, Japan controlled only twelve of the forty-eight provinces. One element of resistance in the Central Luzon area was furnished by the Hukbalahap, which armed some 30,000 people and extended their control over much of Luzon. The Allies as well as the combined American and Filipino soldiers invaded in 1944–45; the battle for Manila was contested street by street with large numbers of civilians killed.\n\nAs in most occupied countries, crime, looting, corruption, and black markets were endemic. With a view of building up the economic base of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese Army envisioned using the islands as a source of agricultural products needed by its industry. For example, Japan had a surplus of sugar from Taiwan, and a severe shortage of cotton, so they try to grow cotton on sugar lands with disastrous results. They lacked the seeds, pesticides, and technical skills to grow cotton. Jobless farm workers flock to the cities, where there was minimal relief and few jobs.\n\nThe Japanese Army also tried using cane sugar for fuel, castor beans and copra for oil, derris for quinine, cotton for uniforms, and abaca (hemp) for rope. The plans were very difficult to implement in the face of limited skills, collapsed international markets, bad weather, and transportation shortages. The program was a failure that gave very little help to Japanese industry, and diverted resources needed for food production. As Karnow reports, Filipinos \"rapidly learned as well that 'co-prosperity' meant servitude to Japan's economic requirements.\"\n\nLiving conditions were bad throughout the Philippines during the war. Transportation between the islands was difficult because of lack of fuel. Food was in very short supply, with sporadic famines and epidemic diseases\n\nThe Japanese tried to remove all Western and American cultural influences. They met fierce resistance when they tried to undermine the Catholic Church by arresting 500 Christian missionaries. The Filipinos came to feel morally superior to the brutal Japanese and rejected their advances. Newspapers and the media were tightly censored. The Japanese tried to reshape schools and impose the Japanese language. They formed neighborhood associations to inform on the opposition.\n\nConscription was the main means for raising forces in Britain and the dominions. This was a reversal of policy from 1914, when too many men who were vitally needed on the home front volunteered for the military.\nBritain's total mobilisation during this period proved to be successful in winning the war, by maintaining strong support from public opinion. The war was a \"people's war\" that enlarged democratic aspirations and produced promises of a postwar welfare state.\n\nFor the military story see Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II.\n\nIn mid-1940, the Royal Air Force (RAF) was called on to fight the Battle of Britain, but suffered serious losses. It lost 458 aircraft in France—more than current production— and was hard pressed. The government decided to concentrate on only five types of aircraft in order to optimise output. They were: Wellingtons, Whitley Vs, Blenheims, Hurricanes and Spitfires. These aircraft received extraordinary priority, which covered the supply of materials and equipment and even made it possible to divert from other types the necessary parts, equipment, materials and manufacturing resources. Labour was moved from other aircraft work to factories engaged on the specified types. Cost was no object. The delivery of new fighters rose from 256 in April to 467 in September—more than enough to cover the losses—and Fighter Command emerged triumphantly from the Battle of Britain in October with more aircraft than it had possessed at the beginning. Starting in 1941, the US provided munitions through Lend-Lease that totalled $15.5 billion\n\nFood, clothing, petrol, leather and other items were rationed. Perishable items such as fruit were not rationed. Access to luxuries was severely restricted, although there was also a significant black market. Families also grew \"victory gardens\", and small home vegetable gardens. Many goods were conserved to turn into weapons later, such as fat for nitroglycerin production. People in the countryside were less affected by rationing as they had greater access to locally sourced unrationed products than people in cities, and were more able to grow their own.\n\nThe rationing system, which was originally based on a specific basket of goods for each consumer, was much improved by switching to a points system which allowed housewives to make choices based on their own priorities. Food rationing also permitted the upgrading of the quality of the food available, and housewives approved—except for the absence of white bread and the government's imposition of an unpalatable wheat meal \"national loaf\". Surveys of public opinion showed that most Britons were pleased that rationing brought equality and a guarantee of a decent meal at an affordable cost.\n\nFrom very early in the war, it was thought that the major industrial cities of Britain, especially London, would come under Luftwaffe air attack; this did happen in The Blitz. Some children were sent to Canada, the US and Australia, and millions of children and some mothers were evacuated from London and other major cities to safer parts of the country when the war began, under government plans for the evacuation of civilians, but they often filtered back. When the Blitz bombing began on September 6, 1940, they evacuated again. The discovery of the poor health and hygiene of evacuees was a shock to many Britons, and helped prepare the way for the Beveridge Report. Children were evacuated if their parents agreed; but in some cases they had no choice. The children were only allowed to take a few things with them, including a gas mask, books, money, clothes, ration book and some small toys.\n\nAn Emergency Hospital Service was established at the beginning of the war, in the expectation that it would be required to deal with large numbers of casualties.\n\nA common theme called for an expansion of the welfare state as a reward to the people for their wartime sacrifices. This was set out in a famous report by William Beveridge. It recommended that the various forms of assistance that had grown up piecemeal since 1911 be rationalised. Unemployment benefits and sickness benefits were to be universal. There would be new benefits for maternity. The old-age pension system would be revised and expanded, and require that a person retired. A full-scale National Health Service would provide free medical care for everyone. All the major political parties endorsed the principles, and they were largely put into effect when peace returned.\n\nThe themes of equality and sacrifice were dominant during the war, and in the memory of the war. Historian Jose Harris points out that the war was seen at the time and by a generation of writers as a period of outstanding national unity and social solidarity. There was little antiwar sentiment during or after the war. Furthermore, Britain turned more toward the collective welfare state during the war, expanding it in the late 1940s and reaching a broad consensus supporting it across party lines. By the 1970s and 1980s, however, historians were exploring the subtle elements of continuing diversity and conflict in society during the war period. For example, at first historians emphasized that strikes became illegal in July 1940, and no trade union called one during the war. Later historians pointed to the many localised unofficial strikes, especially in coal mining, shipbuilding, the metal trades and engineering, with as many as 3.7 million man days lost in 1944.\n\nThe BBC collected 47,000 wartime recollections and 15,000 images in 2003-6 and put them online. The CD audiobook \"Home Front 1939–45\" also contains a selection of period interviews and actuality recordings.\n\nCanada joined the war effort on September 10, 1939; the government deliberately waited after Britain's decision to go to war, partly to demonstrate its independence from Britain and partly to give the country extra time to import arms from the United States as a non-belligerent. War production was ramped up quickly, and was centrally managed through the Department of Munitions and Supply. Unemployment faded away.\n\nCanada became one of the largest trainers of pilots for the Allies through the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Many Canadian men joined the war effort, so with them overseas and industries pushing to increase production, women took up positions to aid in the war effort. The hiring of men in many positions in civilian employment was effectively banned later in the war through measures taken under the \"National Resources Mobilization Act\"..\n\nShipyards and repair facilities expanded dramatically as over a thousand warships and cargo vessels were built, along with thousands of auxiliary craft, small boats and others.\n\nCanada expanded food production, but shipped so much to Britain that food rationing had to be imposed. In 1942 it shipped to Britain 25 per cent of total meat production (including 75% of the bacon), 65% of the cheese and 13% of the eggs.\n\n20% of Canada's population were neither of British nor French origin, and their status was of special concern. The main goal was to integrate the marginalized European ethnicities—in contrast to the First World War policy of internment camps for Ukrainians and Germans. In the case of Germany, Italy and especially Japan, the government watched minorities closely for signs of loyalty to their homelands. The fears proved groundless. In February 1942 21,000 Japanese Canadians were rounded up and sent to internment camps that closely resembled similar camps in the US, because the two governments had agreed in 1941 to coordinate their evacuation policies. Most had lived in British Columbia, but in 1945 they were released from detention and allowed to move anywhere in Canada \"except\" British Columbia, or they could go to Japan. Most went to the Toronto area.\n\nCanadian women responded to urgent appeals to make do, recycle and salvage in order to come up with needed supplies. They saved fats and grease; gathered recycled goods; handed out information on the best ways to get the most out of recycled goods; and organized many other events to decrease the amount of waste. Volunteer organizations led by women also prepared packages for the military overseas and for prisoners of war in Axis countries.\n\nWith World War II came a dire need for employees in the workplace. Without women to step in, the economy would have collapsed. By autumn 1944 there were twice as many women working full-time in Canada's paid labour force as in 1939: between 1.0 and 1.2 million; and this did not include part-time workers or women working on farms.\" Women had to take on this intensive labour and still find time to make jam, clothes, and undertake other acts of volunteering to aid the men overseas.\n\nThe government greatly expanded its powers in order to better direct the war effort, and Australia's industrial and human resources were focused on supporting the Australian and American armed forces. There were a few Japanese attacks, most notably on Darwin in February 1942, along with the widespread fear in 1942, that Australia would be invaded.\n\nAustralia entered the war in 1939 and sent its forces to fight the Germans in the Middle East (where they were successful) and Singapore (where they were captured by the Japanese in 1942). By 1943, 37% of the Australian GDP was directed at the war effort. Total war expenditure came to £2,949 million between 1939 and 1945.\n\nThe Curtin Labor Government took over in October 1941, and energised the war effort, with rationing of scarce fuel, clothing and some food. When Japan entered the war in December 1941, the danger was at hand, and all women and children were evacuated from Darwin and northern Australia. The Commonwealth Government took control of all income taxation in 1942, which gave it extensive new powers and greatly reduced the states' financial autonomy.\n\nManufacturing grew rapidly, with the assembly of high performance guns and aircraft a specialty. The number of women working in factories rose from 171,000 to 286,000. The arrival of tens of thousands of Americans was greeted with relief, as they could protect Australia where Britain could not. The US sent in $1.1 billion in Lend Lease, and Australia returned about the same total in services, food, rents and supplies to the Americans.\n\nNew Zealand, with a population of 1.7 million, including 99,000 Maori, was highly mobilised during the war. The Labour party was in power and promoted unionisation and the welfare state. The armed forces peaked at 157,000 in September 1942; 135,000 served abroad, and 10,100 died. Agriculture expanded, sending record supplies of meat, butter and wool to Britain. When American forces arrived, they were fed as well. The nation spent £574 million on the war, of which 43% came from taxes, 41% from loans and 16% from American Lend Lease. It was an era of prosperity as the national income soared from £158 million in 1937 to £292 million in 1944. Rationing and price controls kept inflation to only 14% during 1939–45.\n\nMontgomerie shows that the war dramatically increased the roles of women, especially married women, in the labour force. Most of them took traditional female jobs. Some replaced men but the changes here were temporary and reversed in 1945. After the war, women left traditional male occupations and many women gave up paid employment to return home. There was no radical change in gender roles but the war intensified occupational trends under way since the 1920s.\n\nDuring World War II, India was a colony of Britain known as British Raj. Britain declared war on behalf of India without consulting with Indian leaders. This resulted in resignation of Congress Ministries.\n\nThe British recruited some 2.5 million Indian volunteers, who played major roles as soldiers in the Middle East, North Africa and Burma in the British Indian Army. India became the main base for British operations against Japan, and for American efforts to support China.\n\nIn Bengal, with an elected Muslim local government under British supervision, the cutoff of rice imports from Burma led to severe food shortages, made worse by maladministration. Prices soared and millions starved because they could not buy food. In the Bengal famine of 1943, three million people died.\n\nA small anti-British force of about 40,000 men (and a few women) formed in Southeast Asia, the Indian National Army (INA) under Subhas Chandra Bose. It was under Japanese army control and performed poorly in combat. Its members were captured Indian soldiers from British Indian Army who gained release from extreme conditions in POW camps by joining the Japanese-sponsored INA. It participated in Battle Of Kohima and Battle of Imphal. In postwar Indian politics, some Indians called them heroes.\n\nThe Congress Party in 1942 demanded immediate independence, which Britain rejected. Congress then demanded the British immediately \"Quit India\" in August 1942, but the Raj responded by immediately jailing tens of thousands of national, state and regional leaders; knocking Congress out of the war. Meanwhile, the Muslim League supported the war effort and gained prestige and membership, as well as British support for its demands for a separate Muslim state (which became Pakistan in 1947).\n\nHong Kong was a British colony captured by Japan on December 25, 1941, after 18 days of fierce fighting. The conquest was swift, but was followed by days of large-scale looting; over ten thousand Chinese women were raped or gang-raped by the Japanese soldiers. The population halved, from 1.6 million in 1941 to 750,000 at war's end because of fleeing refugees; they returned in 1945.\n\nThe Japanese imprisoned the ruling British colonial elite and sought to win over the local merchant gentry by appointments to advisory councils and neighbourhood watch groups. The policy worked well for Japan and produced extensive collaboration from both the elite and the middle class, with far less terror than in other Chinese cities. Hong Kong was transformed into a Japanese colony, with Japanese businesses replacing the British. The Japanese Empire had severe logistical difficulties and by 1943 the food supply for Hong Kong was problematic.\n\nThe overlords became more brutal and corrupt, and the Chinese gentry became disenchanted. With the surrender of Japan the transition back to British rule was smooth, for on the mainland the Nationalist and Communists forces were preparing for a civil war and ignored Hong Kong. In the long run the occupation strengthened the pre-war social and economic order among the Chinese business community by eliminating some conflicts of interests and reducing the prestige and power of the British.\n\nGermany had not fully mobilized in 1939, nor even in 1941, as society continued in prewar channels. Not until 1943, under Albert Speer (the minister of armaments in the \"Reich\"), did Germany finally redirect its entire economy and manpower to war production. Instead of using all available Germans, it brought in millions of slave workers from conquered countries, treating them badly (and getting low productivity in return). Germany's economy was simply too small for a longer all-out war. Hitler's strategy was to change this by a series of surprise blitzkriegs. This failed with defeats in Russia in 1941 and 1942, and against the economic power of the allies.\n\nInstead of expanding the economies of the occupied nations, the Nazis seized the portable machinery and rail cars, requisitioned most of their industrial output, took large quantities of food (15% of French output), and forced the victims to pay for their military occupation.\n\nThe Nazis forced 15 million people to work in Germany (including POWs); many died from bad living conditions, mistreatment, malnutrition, and executions. At its peak, forced laborers comprised 20% of the German work force and were a vital part of the German economic exploitation of the conquered territories. They were especially concentrated in munitions and agriculture. For example, 1.5 million French soldiers were kept in POW camps in Germany as hostages and forced workers and, in 1943, 600,000 French civilians were forced to move to Germany to work in war plants.\n\nAlthough Germany had about double the population of Britain (80 million versus 46 million), it had to use far more labor to provide food and energy. Britain imported food and employed only a million people (5% of the labour force) on farms, while Germany used 11 million (27%). For Germany to build its twelve synthetic oil plants with a capacity of 3.3 million tons a year required 2.3 million tons of structural steel and 7.5 million man-days of labor. (Britain imported all its oil from Iraq, Persia and North America). To overcome this problem, Germany employed millions of forced laborers and POWs; by 1944, they had brought in more than five million civilian workers and nearly two million prisoners of war—a total of 7.13 million foreign workers.\n\nRationing in Germany was introduced in 1939 immediately upon the outbreak of hostilities. Hitler was at first convinced that it would affect public support for the war if a strict rationing program was introduced. The Nazis were popular partly because Germany was relatively prosperous, and Hitler did not want to lose popularity or public support. Hitler felt that food and other shortages had been a major factor in destroying civilian morale during World War I, leading to defeatism and surrender.\n\nDespite the rationing, civilians had enough food and clothing; witness Howard K. Smith later wrote that \"[f]or a people engaged in a life-and-death war ... the German people for two years of war ate amazingly well.\" The meat ration, for example, was 500 g per week per person. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, however, this changed to 400 g per week, then fell further. Estimating that the meat ration had dropped by up to 80% in five months of fighting in Russia, and citing many other sudden changes in living conditions, Smith wrote that by the time he left Germany in late 1941, \"for the first time ... \"the German people are undernourished\"\". The system gave extra rations for men involved in heavy industry, and extremely low starvation rations for Jews and Poles in the areas occupied by Germany, but not to the Poles inside Germany, many of whom had been brought in to perform heavy labor in German war industries.\n\nAccording to a 1997 post by Walter Felscher to the \"Memories of the 1940s\" electronic mailing list:\n\nThe rations were enough to live from, but clearly did not permit luxuries. Whipped cream was unknown from 1939 until 1948, as well as chocolates, cakes with rich creams etc. Meat could not be eaten every day. Other items were not rationed, but simply became unavailable as they had to be imported from overseas: coffee in particular, which throughout was replaced by substitutes made from roasted grains. Vegetables and local fruit were not rationed; imported citrus fruits and bananas were unavailable. In more rural areas, farmers continued to bring their products to the markets, as large cities depended on long distance delivery. Many people kept rabbits for their meat when it became scarce in shops, and it was often a child's job to care for them each day.\n\nBy spring 1945, food distribution and the ration system were increasingly in collapse, due to insurmountable transportation disruption and the rapid advance of the Allied armies from west and east with consequent loss of food storage facilities. In Berlin, at the start of the Battle of Berlin, the authorities announced a special supplementary food ration on April 20, 1945. It consisted of a pound (450 g) of bacon or sausage, half a pound of rice, half a pound of peas or pulses, a pound of sugar, four ounces (110 g) of coffee substitute, one ounce of real coffee, and a tin of vegetables or fruit. They also announced that standard food ration allocations for the next fortnight could be claimed in advance. The extra allocation of rations were dubbed by Berliners \"Himmelfahrtsrationen\", Ascension-day rations, \"because with these rations we shall now ascend to heaven\"\n\nGermany had a very large and well organized nursing service, with three main organizations, one for Catholics, one for Protestants, and the DRK (Red Cross). In 1934 the Nazis set up their own nursing unit, the Brown nurses, which absorbed one of the smaller groups, bringing it up to 40,000 members. It set up kindergartens in competition with the other nursing organizations, hoping to seize control of the minds of the younger Germans. Civilian psychiatric nurses who were Nazi party members participated in the killing of invalids, although this was shrouded in euphemisms and denials.\n\nMilitary nursing was primarily handled by the DRK, which came under partial Nazi control. Frontline medical services were provided by male doctors and medics. Red Cross nurses served widely within the military medical services, staffing the hospitals that perforce were close to the front lines and at risk of bombing attacks. Two dozen were awarded the highly prestigious Iron Cross for heroism under fire. They are among the 470,000 German women who served with the military.\n\nThe conquest of Germany in 1945 freed 11 million foreigners, called \"displaced persons\" (DPs)- chiefly forced laborers and POWs. In addition to the POWs, the Germans seized 2.8 million Soviet workers to labor in factories in Germany. Returning them home was a high priority for the Allies. However, in the case of Russians and Ukrainians returning often meant suspicion or prison or even death. The UNRRA, Red Cross and military operations provided food, clothing, shelter and assistance in returning home. In all, 5.2 million were repatriated to the Soviet Union, 1.6 million to Poland, 1.5 million to France, and 900,000 to Italy, along with 300,000 to 400,000 each to Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Belgium.\n\nIn 1944–45, over 2.5 million ethnic Germans fled from Eastern Europe in family groups, desperately hoping to reach Germany before being overtaken by the Russians. Half a million died in the process, the survivors were herded into refugee camps in East and West Germany for years. Meanwhile, Moscow encouraged its troops to regard German women as targets for revenge. Russian Marshal Georgi Zhukov called on his troops to, \"Remember our brothers and sisters, our mothers and fathers, our wives and children tortured to death by Germans...We shall exact a brutal revenge for everything.\" Upwards of two million women inside Germany were raped in 1945 in a tidal wave of looting, burning and vengeance.\n\nThe Japanese home front was elaborately organized, block by block, with full-scale food rationing and many controls over labor. The government used propaganda heavily and planned in minute detail regarding the mobilization of manpower, identification of critical choke points, food supplies, logistics, air raid shelters, and the evacuation of children and civilians from targeted cities. Food supplies were very tight before the heavy bombing began in fall 1944, then grew to a crisis. There was only a small increase of 1.4 million women entering the labor force between 1940 and 1944. Intense propaganda efforts by the government to promote savings and postpone consumer purchases were largely successful, especially on the part of housewives who generally control their family budget. The minister of welfare announced, \"In order to secure its labor force, the enemy is drafting women, but in Japan, out of consideration for the family system, we will not draft them.\"\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>The weaknesses in the maximum utilization of womanpower was indicated by the presence of 600,000 domestic servants in wealthy families in 1944. The government wanted to raise the birthrate, even with 8.2 million men in the armed forces, of whom three million were killed. Government incentives helped to raise the marriage rate, but the number of births held steady at about 2.2 million per year, with a 10% decline in 1944–45, and another 15% decline in 1945–46. Strict rationing of milk led to smaller babies. There was little or no long-term impact on the overall demographic profile of Japan.\n\nThe government began making evacuation plans in late 1943, and started removing entire schools from industrial cities to the countryside, where they were safe from bombing and had better access to food supplies. In all 1.3 million children were moved—with their teachers but not their parents. When the American bombing began in earnest in late 1944, 10 million people fled the cities to the safety of the countryside, including two-thirds of the residents of the largest cities and 87% of the children. Left behind were the munitions workers and government officials. By April 1945, 87% of the younger children had been moved to the countryside.\n\nCivil defense units were transformed into combat units, especially the Peoples Volunteer Combat Corps, enlisting civilian men up to the age of 60 and women to age 40. Starting in January 1945 the government operated an intensive training program to enable the entire civilian population to fight the \"decisive battle\" with the American invaders using grenades, explosive gliders and bamboo spears. Everyone understood they would probably die in what the government called, the \"Grand Suicide of the One Hundred Million.\"\nHealth conditions became much worse after the surrender in September 1945, with so much housing stock destroyed, and an additional 6.6 million Japanese repatriated from Manchuria, China, Indochina, Formosa, Korea, Saipan and the Philippines.\n\nThere was great civilian support for the war by July 1937. The successful Japanese invasion of Manchuria in the early 1930s fueled the rise of aggressive foreign policy and radical nationalism. The Japanese shimbun's and radio station's reporting of the events helped spread this sentiment quickly. Understanding the benefits of educating the populace about the war efforts, the Japanese government soon followed suite. Starting in January 1938, ten minutes of war news was broadcast at 7:30 PM every day.\n\nAt the start of the war, the Home Ministry of Japan established more campaigns to generate support for the war. For instance, citizens were encouraged to avoid luxuries and save wealth for the state. The government even reformed its education system by rewriting ethics textbooks to be more nationalistic and militaristic. Schoolchildren were also taught nationalistic songs such as the Umi Yukaba: \n\n\"\"If I go away to the sea,\"\"I shall be a corpse washed up.\"\"If I go away to the mountain,\"\"I shall be a corpse in the grass\"\"But if I die for the Emperor,\"\"It will not be a regret.\"\" In 1937, the Shinmin no michi (The Way of the Subjects) was given to all Japanese citizens in order to teach them how they should behave. Similarly, the Japanese war ministry issued the Senjinkun (Field Service Code) in 1941, which tried to educate the soldiers on how to behave during wartime. Specifically, the Senjinkun contained the famous ideal of no-surrender which inspired many Japanese servicemen to commit suicide than risk capture or surrender. Observation of civilian wartime diaries and letters suggest that the government was successful in garnering massive support for the war. Despite the rationing that causes food shortages, many Japanese were happy to oblige. Sakamoto Kane, Kōchi housewife wrote: \"For fish, the community council gave us a distribution of only shrimp and swordfish; we can't get either pork or beef. I have the feeling that little by little there will be shortages but that in war, we must aim for frugality even in small ways and we must be careful about waste–for the sake of the country.\" Such sentiments were very common in Japan.\n\nFurther speaking to the success of the Japanese government, there were only ~1000 deserters every year for the six years of World War II. In comparison, ~40,000 Americans and more than 100,000 British servicemen deserted during World War II. While there was some resistance from the Japanese, most were supportive of the WW II efforts. In fact, many were prepared to fight against the invaders if the opportunity came. In some areas of Japan, women practiced fighting with bamboo spears; girls vowed to kill at least one invader before they died; children practiced throwing balls in anticipation that they would be throwing grenades at the enemy. There were even reports of mass civilian suicides near the end of World War II, an attempt to avoid capture. This was partially due to loyalty for the emperor and fear tactics from the Japanese government, which had spread misinformation that the American soldiers would commit atrocities against innocent civilians. For the other Japanese civilians, there was a general sense of sorrow at the time of Japan's surrender. Inoue Tarō, a Japanese teenager who was tasked with war work, wrote a statement in his diary at the announcement that Japan had surrendered: \"Cry! Let's cry until we can't any longer. Later we'll probably see the outpouring of a new power.\"\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>669 is the combined number of deserters and defectors in 1939.\n\nAgricultural production in the home islands held up well during the war until the bombing started. It fell from an index of 110 in 1942 to 84 in 1944 and only 65 in 1945. Worse, imports dried up. The Japanese food rationing system was effective throughout the war, and there were no serious incidences of malnutrition. A government survey in Tokyo showed that in 1944 families depended on the black market for 9% of their rice, 38% of their fish, and 69% of their vegetables.\n\nThe Japanese domestic food supply depended upon imports, which were largely cut off by the American submarine and bombing campaigns. Likewise there was little deep sea fishing, so that the fish ration by 1941 was mostly squid harvested from coastal waters. The result was a growing food shortage, especially in the cities. There was some malnutrition but no reported starvation. Despite government rationing of food, some families were forced to spend more than their monthly income could offer on black market food purchases. They would rely on savings or exchange food for clothes or other possessions.\nThe American aerial bombing of a total of 65 Japanese cities took from 400,000 to 600,000 civilian lives, with 100,000+ in Tokyo alone, over 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. The Battle of Okinawa resulted in 80,000–150,000 civilian deaths. In addition civilian death among settlers who died attempting to return to Japan from Manchuria in the winter of 1945 were probably around 100,000. The total of Japanese military fatalities between 1937 and 1945 were 2.1 million; most came in the last year of the war and were caused by starvation or severe malnutrition in garrisons cut off from supplies.\n\nAccording to oral history studied by Thomas R.H. Havens, traditional paternalistic norms proved a barrier when the government wanted to exploit woman power more fully for the war effort. Compulsory employment in munitions factories was possible for unmarried women, but social norms prevented married women from doing that sort of work, in sharp contrast to Russia, Britain, Germany and the United States. The absence of so many young men dramatically disrupted long-standing patterns of marriage, fertility, and family life. Severe shortages of ordinary items, including food and housing, were far more oppressive than governmental propaganda efforts. Japanese women obediently followed orders, and there were no serious disruptions such as rioting over food shortages. Forced prostitution for the benefit of Japanese soldiers created the \"comfort women\" program that proved highly embarrassing to Japan for decades after the war. Non-Japanese women from colonies such as Korea and Formosa were especially vulnerable.\n\nBeginning in the late 20th century cultural historians turned their attention to the role of women in wartime, especially the Second World War. Sources often used include magazines published—by men—for female readers. Typically fictional and nonfictional stories focused on social roles as mothers and wives, especially in dealing with hardships of housing and food supplies, and financial concerns in the absence of menfolk at war. Problems of fashion wartime were a high priority in such magazines in all major countries. Historians report that the Japanese textile and fashion industries were highly successful in adapting to wartime shortages and propaganda needs. Magazines for teenage girls emphasized they must follow patriotic demands that compelled them to give up their adolescent freedoms and transform themselves from \"shōjo\", which connotes adolescent playfulness, into \"gunkoku shōjo\" [girls of a military nation], with significant home front responsibilities. Evacuation of women and children from the major cities, out of fear of Allied bombing, was covered in detail to emphasize willingness to sacrifice for patriotism portrayed through fiction, news articles and photographs. The government controlled all the media, and supervise the popular magazines so their Content would strategically spread the government's goals and propaganda.\n\nHealth and living conditions worsened after the surrender in September 1945. Most of the housing stock in large cities was destroyed, just as refugees tried to return from the rural areas. Adding to the crisis there was an influx of 3.5 million returning soldiers and 3.1 million Japanese civilians forcibly repatriated from Imperial outposts in Manchuria, China, Indochina, Formosa, Korea, Saipan and the Philippines; about 400,000 civilians were left behind and not heard of again. Meanwhile, 1.2 million Koreans, POWs and other non-Japanese left Japan. The government implemented pro-natalist policies, which led to an increase in the marriage rate, but birth rates remained steady until they declined by 10% in the stress of the last year of the war, and another 15% during the hardship of the postwar period.\n\nThe American bombing campaign of all major cities severely impacted the economy, as did the shortages of oil and raw materials that intensified when Japanese merchant shipping was mostly sunk by American submarines. When industrial production was available to the military, for example, 24 percent of Japan's finished steel in 1937 was allocated to the military, compared to 85 percent in 1945. By the end of the war, output percent of the highest capacity was still 100 percent for steel, although only 75 percent for aluminum, 63 percent for machine tools, 42 percent for vacuum tubes, 54 percent cement, 32 percent cotton fabric, and 36 percent for wool.\n\nSevere food shortages were common throughout the war zones, especially in Europe where Germany used starvation as a military weapon. Japan did not use it as a deliberate policy, but the breakdown of its transportation and distribution systems led to famine and starvation conditions among its soldiers on many Pacific islands. Bose (1990) studies the three great Asian famines that took place during the war: Bengal in India, Honan in China, and Tonkin in Vietnam. In each famine at least two million people died. They all occurred in densely populated provinces where the subsistence foundations of agriculture was failing under the weight of demographic and market pressures. In each cases famine played a role in undermining the legitimacy of the state and the preexisting social structure.\n\nA great deal of housing was destroyed or largely damaged during the war, especially in the Soviet Union, Germany, and Japan. In Japan, about a third of the families were homeless at the end of the war. In Germany, about 25% of the total housing stock was destroyed or heavily damaged; in the main cities the proportion was about 45%. Elsewhere in Europe, 22% of the prewar housing in Poland was totally destroyed; 21% in Greece; 9% in Austria, 8% in the Netherlands; 8% in France, 7% in Britain, 5% Italy and 4% in Hungary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0960777318000255\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He served as Judge of the High Court of Admiralty from 1798 to 1828.\n\nScott was born at Heworth, a village about four miles from Newcastle upon Tyne, the son of a tradesman engaged in the transport of coal. His younger brother John Scott became Lord Chancellor and was made Earl of Eldon. He was educated at Newcastle Royal Grammar School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he gained a Durham scholarship in 1761. In 1764 he graduated and became first a probationary fellow and then as successor to William (afterwards the well known Sir William) Jones a tutor of University College. As Camden reader of ancient history he rivalled the reputation of Blackstone. Although he had joined the Middle Temple in 1762, it was not till 1776 that Scott devoted himself to a systematic study of law.\n\nScott graduated as doctor of civil law, and, after a customary year of silence, commenced practice in the ecclesiastical courts. His professional success was rapid. In 1783 he became registrar of the court of faculties, and in 1788 judge of the consistory court and advocate-general, in that year too receiving the honour of knighthood; and in 1798 he was made judge of the high court of admiralty. In this capacity he heard on appeal two important cases having to do with the abolition of the slave trade.\n\nOn 22 May 1809 took \"Donna Marianna\" on the Cape Coast for breach of the Act for the abolition of the slave trade. The Vice admiralty court at Sierra Leone condemned the vessel. Although \"Donna Marianna\" was ostensibly a Portuguese vessel, Scott upheld the seizure on the grounds that she was actually a British vessel and her Portuguese papers were a fraud.\n\nThe second case involved the French ship \"Le Lois\" after it had been seized by the West Africa Squadron for slave trading off the African coast at Cape Mesurado. HMS \"Queen Charlotte\" had originally vindicated the seizure and confiscation of the ship and cargo. However Scott overturned this judgement, saying that the way \"Le Lois\" had been stopped and boarded was illegal as \"No nation can exercise a right of visitation and search on the common and unappropriated parts of the sea, save only on the belligerent claim.\" He accepted that this would constitute a serious impediment to the suppression of the slave trade, but argued that this should be remedied through international treaties rather than Naval officers exceeding what they were permitted to do.\n\nHe twice contested Oxford University in 1780 without success, but successfully in 1801. He also sat for Downton in 1790. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1793.\n\nUpon the coronation of George IV in 1821 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Stowell, of Stowell Park in the County of Gloucester, taking his title from the name of his estate. After a life of judicial service Lord Stowell retired from the bench – from the consistory court in August 1821, and from the high court of admiralty in December 1827.\n\nLord Stowell married twice. His first marriage, in 1781, was to Anna Maria, eldest daughter and heiress of John Bagnall of Erleigh Court, near Reading, in Berkshire, where the two later resided. They had four children, one of whom, a daughter, survived him. He married again, in 1813, the dowager Marchioness of Sligo, née Louisa Catharine Howe, younger daughter of the first and last Earl Howe of the 1788 creation, widow of John Browne, 1st Marquess of Sligo.\n\nHe died on 28 January 1836 at Erleigh Court, aged 90, and the barony became extinct.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2194237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194237", "title": "The Dog in the Manger", "text": "The Dog in the Manger\n\nThe story and metaphor of The Dog in the Manger derives from an old Greek fable which has been transmitted in several different versions. Interpreted variously over the centuries, the metaphor is now used to speak of one who spitefully prevents others from having something for which one has no use. Although the story was ascribed to Aesop's Fables in the 15th century, there is no ancient source that does so.\n\nThe short form of the fable as cited by Laura Gibbs is: \"There was a dog lying in a manger who did not eat the grain, but who nevertheless prevented the horse from being able to eat anything either.\"\n\nThe story was first glossed in the 1st century CE lexicon of Diogenianus as \"The dog in the manger, concerning those who neither themselves use nor allow others to use: Insofar as the dog neither itself eats the barleycorns, nor allows the horse to\". It was twice used in the following century by Greek writer Lucian: in \"Remarks addressed to an illiterate book-fancier\" and in his play \"Timon the Misanthrope\". One other contemporary poetic source is a paederastic epigram by Straton of Sardis in the \"Greek Anthology\".\n\nAt roughly the same time, an alternative version of the fable was alluded to in Saying 102 of the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas. This example involves oxen rather than a horse: \"Jesus said, 'Woe to the Pharisees, for they are like a dog sleeping in the manger of oxen, for neither does he eat nor does he let the oxen eat'.\" Assuming that this gospel is not an original document, the saying seems to be an adaptation of criticism of the Pharisees in the canonical Gospel of Matthew (23.13): \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces; you do not enter yourselves, nor will you let others enter.\"\n\nThe fable does not appear in any of the traditional collections of Aesop's Fables and is not attributed to him until Steinhöwel's \"Esopus\" (c. 1476). There it is titled \"Of the envious dog\" (\"de cane invido\") and illustrates a moral proposition: \"People frequently begrudge something to others that they themselves cannot enjoy. Even though it does them no good, they won't let others have it.\" After the cattle that it hinders from eating remonstrate with it, Steinhöwel goes on to mention that \"The same thing happened when a dog was holding a bone in his mouth: the dog couldn't chew on the bone that way, but no other dog was able to chew on it either.\"\n\nThere were, however, earlier 14th century poetic references to the fable. In John Gower's \"Confessio Amantis\" (c.1390) it is related:\nThough the next reference in English is in John Langland's \"The Pilgrimage of the Life of Man\" (1426), where it is applied to a personification of miserliness, the work was written almost a century before in French by Guillaume de Deguileville (1335).\n\nWhile a horse figures in some allusions by later writers, the ox is the preferred beast in Renaissance emblem books. It appears as such in a Latin poem by Hieronymus Osius (1564), although the accompanying illustration shows both an ox and an ass and the dog there, as in Steinhöwel, carries a bone clenched between its teeth. Oxen appear also in the Latin prose version of Arnold Freitag (1579) and in the English poem by Geoffrey Whitney (1586). Most of these authors follow Steinhöwel in interpreting the fable as an example of envy, but Christoph Murer's emblem of 1622 is titled meanness (\"Kargheit\") and the accompanying verse explains that such behaviour is miserly, not using what one has for oneself nor for the relief of others in need.\n\nLater on the dog's behaviour is reinterpreted as malicious, a reading made clear in Roger L'Estrange's pithy version: \"A churlish envious Cur was gotten into a manger, and there lay growling and snarling to keep the Provender. The Dog eat none himself, and yet rather ventur'd the starving his own Carcase than he would suffer any Thing to be the better for't. THE MORAL. Envy pretends to no other Happiness than what it derives from the Misery of other People, and will rather eat nothing itself than not to starve those that would.\" Samuel Croxall echoes L'Estrange's observation in \"Fables of Aesop and Others\" (1722). \"The stronger the passion is, the greater torment he endures; and subjects himself to a continual real pain, by only wishing ill to others.\" It is with this understanding that the idiom of \"a dog in a manger\" is most often used currently. However, a recent study has noted that it seems to be falling out of use, in America at least, concluding that \"the majority of [respondents] do not know it or even recall ever having heard it\".\n\nOne of Lucian's allusions to the fable gives it a metaphorically sexual slant: \"You used to say that they acted absurdly in that they loved you to excess, yet did not dare to enjoy you when they might, and instead of giving free rein to their passion when it lay in their power to do so, they kept watch and ward, looking fixedly at the seal and the bolt; for they thought it enjoyment enough, not that they were able to enjoy you themselves, but that they were shutting out everyone else from a share in the enjoyment, like the dog in the manger that neither ate the barley herself nor permitted the hungry horse to eat it.\" (\"Timon the Misanthrope\")\n\nIn the 1687 Francis Barlow edition of the fables, Aphra Behn similarly sums up the sexual politics of the idiom: \"Thus aged lovers with young beautys live, Keepe off the joys they want the power to give.\" It was of exactly such a situation involving a eunuch and his slaveboys that Straton had complained in the Greek anthology. But the idiom was also applied to occasions of heterosexual jealousy between equals, as for example in Emily Brontë's \"Wuthering Heights\", where it arises during an argument between Catherine Linton and Isabella Linton over Isabella's love for Heathcliff.\n\nA Spanish story involving sexual jealousy and selfishness appears in Lope de Vega's play \"El Perro del Hortelano\" (The Gardener's Dog, in 1618). In this case, De Vega's title alludes to the parallel European idiom involving a variant story in which a gardener sets his dog to guard his cabbages (or lettuces). After the gardener's death the dog continues to forbid people access to the beds, giving rise to the simile \"He's like the gardener's dog that eats no cabbage and won't let others either\" or, for short, \"playing the gardener's dog\" (\"faire le chien du jardinier\"). In the Martinique Creole there is also the similar-sounding proverb, \"The dog doesn’t like the banana and he doesn’t want the hen to eat it.\"\n\nPopular artistic allusions to the fable, or the idiom arising from it, were especially common during the 19th century. Where Lope de Vega had adapted the theme to a problem play in the 17th century, the Belgian composer Albert Grisar used it as the basis for his one-act comic opera of 1855, \"Le chien du jardinier\". The idiom was also taken up in the US by the successful writer of farces, Charles H. Hoyt, where a horse rather than the more common ox figured on the 1899 poster (see left). The title has also been used in various media since then, but without reference to the fable in publicity or on covers.\n\nSeveral well-known artists had illustrated fable collections and their designs were recycled for various purposes. Among these may be mentioned Wenceslaus Hollar's print for the 1666 Ogilby edition of Aesop's fables, in which a dog occupies the manger and barks at a single ox being driven into a wooden barn. Shortly afterwards, Francis Barlow pictured the dog snarling on a pile of hay in a brick-built barn, while the dog does so in a more open farmyard structure in Samuel Howitt's \"A New Work of Animals\" (1810). Hollar's design of the ox turning its head to look round at the dog with the barn's brick entrance behind was clearly an influence on later illustrators, including those for the various editions of Samuel Croxall's fable collection and for Thomas Bewick's of 1818.\n\nSuch illustrations were influential too on those who created designs for crockery. That on a Spode serving dish from 1831 is also related to the Barlow design, although the action takes place outside the barn. A Staffordshire nursery dish of 1835, however, has more in common with Howitt's design. The fable also figured on the popular alphabet plates from Brownhills Pottery later in the 19th century, although in this case only the ox's head is featured as it gazes at the dog reared up and barking.\n\nIn Britain artistic preference was for the anecdotal and the sentimental among 19th century genre artists, who found the fable ideal for their purposes. The most successful, and typical of many others, was Walter Hunt (1861–1941), whose \"Dog in the Manger\" (1885) was bought by the Chantrey Bequest and is now in Tate Britain. At least two versions exist of the work. In one two calves peer at a Jack Russell puppy that sits looking back in the hay that they want to eat. In the Tate version, a different breed is curled up asleep in their manger.\n\nThe idiom was also put to figurative use during the 19th century. In much the same anecdotal tradition, the print-maker Thomas Lord Busby (active 1804–37) used the title to show a dyspeptic man eyeing askance a huge dinner, while hungry beggars and an importunate dog look on, in a work from 1826. Later on Charles H. Bennett revisited the scene in his \"The Fables of Aesop and Others Translated into Human Nature\" (1857), where a dog dressed as a footman and carrying food to his master bares his teeth at the poor ox begging at the door. In this case the fable was rewritten to fit the scenario.\n\nSuch work, bordering on the cartoon, provided a profitable avenue for social commentary. An American example appeared in the illustration to a children's book of 1880, where a dog dressed as a ruffian stands on the straw, cudgel in hand, warning off a cow and her calf (see above). It ushers in use of the theme in illustrated papers a little later. J. S. Pughe's centrefold in \"Puck\" pictures a dog in the uniform of a U.S. Marine holding off European nations that wish to participate in the Nicaragua Canal scheme. It was followed by the cover cartoon of \"Harper's Weekly\" picturing William Jennings Bryan as the dog, obstructing the choice of the Democratic presidential candidacy and preventing others getting at the White House oats.\n\n"}

Ram-air inflation forces the parafoil into a classic wing cross-section. Parafoils are most commonly constructed out of ripstop nylon.\n\nThe device was developed in 1964 by Domina Jalbert (1904–1991). Jalbert had a history of designing kites and was involved in the development of hybrid balloon-kite aerial platforms for carrying scientific instruments. He envisaged the parafoil would be used to suspend an aerial platform or for the recovery of space equipment. A patent was granted in 1966. \n\nDeployment shock prevented the parafoil's immediate acceptance as a parachute. It was not until the addition of a drag canopy on the riser lines (known as a \"slider\") which slowed their spread that the parafoil became a suitable parachute. Compared to a simple round canopy, a parafoil parachute has greater steerability, will glide further and allows greater control of the rate of descent; the parachute format is mechanically a hang glider of the free-flight kite type and such aspects spawned paraglider use. \n\nThe air flow into the parafoil is coming more from below than the flight path might suggest, so the frontmost ropes tow against the airflow. When gliding, the angle of attack is lowered and the airflow meets the parafoil head on. This makes it difficult to achieve an optimum gliding angle without the parafoil deflating.\n\nIn 1984 Jalbert was awarded the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) Gold Parachuting Medal for inventing the parafoil.\n\nParafoils see wide use in a variety of windsports such as kite flying, powered parachutes, paragliding, kitesurfing, speed flying, wingsuit flying and skydiving. The world's largest kite is a parafoil-variant.\n\n\n"}

In response to a message that it receives, an Actor can make local decisions, create more Actors, send more messages, and designate how to respond to the next message received. Actor model theory incorporates theories of the events and structures of Actor computations, their proof theory, and denotational models.\n\nFrom the definition of an Actor, it can be seen that numerous events take place: local decisions, creating Actors, sending messages, receiving messages, and designating how to respond to the next message received.\n\nHowever, this article focuses on just those events that are the arrival of a message sent to an Actor.\n\nThis article reports on the results published in Hewitt [2006].\n\nThe activation ordering (codice_1) is a fundamental ordering that models one event activating another (there must be energy flow in the message passing from an event to an event which it activates).\n\n\nThe arrival ordering of an Actor codice_10 ( codice_11) models the (total) ordering of events in which a message arrives at codice_10. Arrival ordering is determined by \"arbitration\" in processing messages (often making use of a digital circuit called an arbiter). The arrival events of an Actor are on its world line. The arrival ordering means that the Actor model inherently has indeterminacy (see Indeterminacy in concurrent computation).\n\n\nThe combined ordering (denoted by codice_24) is defined to be the transitive closure of the activation ordering and the arrival orderings of all Actors.\n\n\nThe combined ordering is obviously transitive by definition.\n\nIn [Baker and Hewitt 197?], it was conjectured that the above laws might entail the following law:\n\nHowever, [Clinger 1981] surprisingly proved that the Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering is independent of the previous laws, \"i.e.\",\n\nTheorem. \"The Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering does not follow from the previously stated laws.\"\n\nProof. It is sufficient to show that there is an Actor computation that satisfies the previously stated laws but violates the Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering.\n\nHowever, we know from physics that infinite energy cannot be expended along a finite trajectory. Therefore, since the Actor model is based on physics, the Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering was taken as an axiom of the Actor model.\n\nThe Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering is closely related to the following law:\n\nIn fact the previous two laws have been shown to be equivalent:\n\nThe law of discreteness rules out Zeno machines and is related to results on Petri nets [Best \"et al.\" 1984, 1987].\n\nThe Law of Discreteness implies the property of unbounded nondeterminism. The combined ordering is used by [Clinger 1981] in the construction of a denotational model of Actors (see denotational semantics).\n\nClinger [1981] used the Actor event model described above to construct a denotational model for Actors using power domains. Subsequently Hewitt [2006] augmented the diagrams with arrival times to construct a technically simpler denotational model that is easier to understand.\n\n\n"}

They released three albums on Mud Records.\n\nSarge was formed in Champaign, Illinois by singer-songwriter, Elizabeth Elmore and bassist, Rachel Switzky. They later recruited a drummer, Chad Romanski. A second guitarist, Pat Cramer, volunteered to work for the band later. The band's first gig was at the Blind Pig in January of 1996.\n\nThe band was considered \"punk rock\" and called \"thoroughly solid\" by \"CMJ New Music Monthly\". In 1999, the \"Chicago Tribune\" called the band a \"well-honed pop group.\" The band broke up in 1999 when Elmore returned to law school.\n\nSarge released albums on Mud Records, as well as released a number of singles.\n\n\n"}

Examples of these special items include a cup of coffee, a tailored suit, and a car. Outside of the business world, the term is used to describe a child or young adult who is learning how to do tasks and is sent to fetch items. A similar job is that of peon in Commonwealth countries.\n\nGofer is a linguistic simplification of the two words go + for = gofor. Simplified, in English, it means go for this or go for that. Gofor reflects the likelihood of instructions to \"go for\" coffee, dry cleaning, or stamps, or to make other straightforward, familiar or unfamiliar procurements. The term \"gofer\" originated in North America.\n\nLikewise \"gofer\" may refer to a junior member of an organisation who generally receive the most vexing and thankless work. Law firms with a top-heavy management structure, having not enough junior lawyers to take care of menial yet necessary tasks, can be referred to as having \"too many loafers and not enough \"gophers\"\".\n\nIn the 1953 movie \"She's Back on Broadway\", at about the 11 minute mark, the word is used backstage at a Broadway show, with a clear explanation.\n\nIn the first season (1976) of the television series \"The Muppet Show\", Scooter was given the stage manager job because his uncle owned the theater where the Muppets performed. The pun was that a gopher not only is an animal, like the Muppets supposedly are, but is a fast animal, collecting food and delivering it somewhere else. At some point in the Muppets series, Kermit the Frog suggested that he himself was a gofer, but probably didn't last long in the job.\n\nIn the fourth season of Boy Meets World, Corey gets a job as a gofer for two shady businessmen (Buddy Hackett and Soupy Sales).\n\nAnother example of a gofer is the fictional character of Salvatore \"Turtle\" Assante (Jerry Ferrara) on the comedy-drama HBO television series \"Entourage\".\n\nIn the \"Taxi\" episode \"Alex the Gofer\", Alex takes a part-time job as an assistant to Broadway producers.\n\nThe term gofer is used in the anime Zombie-Loan.\n\nBrad Pitt's character Cliff Booth is a gofer for Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the 2019 movie \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\".\n"}

It lies superiorly to the medial pterygoid.\n\nThe upper/superior head originates on the infratemporal surface and infratemporal crest of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone and inserts onto the articular disc and fibrous capsule of the temporomandibular joint.\n\nThe lower/inferior head originates on the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate and inserts onto the neck of condyloid process of the mandible; upper/superior head\n\nThe mandibular branch of the fifth cranial nerve, the trigeminal nerve, specifically the lateral pterygoid nerve, innervates the lateral pterygoid muscle.\n\nThe primary function of the lateral pterygoid muscle is to pull the head of the condyle out of the mandibular fossa along the articular eminence to protrude the mandible. A concerted effort of the lateral pterygoid muscles helps in lowering the mandible and opening the jaw, whereas unilateral action of a lateral pterygoid produces contralateral excursion (a form of mastication), usually performed in concert with the medial pterygoids.\n\nUnlike the other three muscles of mastication, the lateral pterygoid is the only muscle of mastication that assists in depressing the mandible (opening the jaw). At the beginning of this action it is assisted by the digastric, mylohyoid and geniohyoid muscles.\n\n"}

It is made of granite, steel, and glass, and weighs 60 tons. The \"sand\" (actually glass granules) flows from the upper to the lower glass chamber for one year. \n\nThe sand runs out on New Year's Eve and the Timewheel is then turned 180 degrees so the flow of the sand can resume for the next year. The turning is accomplished by four people pulling cables, and takes roughly 45 minutes to complete. The Timewheel was unveiled on 1 May 2004 to commemorate the historic enlargement of the European Union that admitted Hungary (along with nine other countries) to the EU.\n\nJános Herner designed and built the Timewheel after an architectural design done by István Janáky.\n\n"}
