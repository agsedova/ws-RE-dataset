{"id": "1826993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826993", "title": "The Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps", "text": "The Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps\n\nThe Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps (formerly the Holy Name Cadets, Cadets of Garfield, Garfield Cadets, and Cadets of Bergen County) is a World Class competitive junior drum and bugle corps. Based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, The Cadets was one of the thirteen founding corps of Drum Corps International (DCI), is a ten-time DCI World Champion, and is the oldest continuously active junior drum and bugle corps in North America.\nCharles Mura, Michael Koeph, and the Rev. Edwin Garrity of the Holy Name Catholic parish in Garfield, New Jersey founded the Holy Name Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps in 1934 as an activity for the boys in the parish. The corps quickly became one of the top competitive corps in the country. In 1940, the Cadets won the American Legion Junior National Championship in Boston, the first of a record nine Legion titles the corps would win between 1940 and 1964. The corps was known not only for its talent but for its traveling to compete. In 1950, the Cadets went on the road for three weeks in order to defend their Legion title in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1958, the Holy Name parish declined to support the corps' travel and disbanded the corps. The members and staff, however, were not willing to cease the corps operations, and reorganized as a new organization, even though the parish kept the uniforms and instruments. The corps traveled to Chicago for Legion Nationals at the members' own expense. Marching as the Cadets of Garfield; wearing uniforms of white shorts, red golf shirts, and \"Aussie\" hats; and using instruments borrowed from the Chicago Cavaliers, the corps managed to finish in second place (one spot ahead of the defending champion Cavaliers). Midway through the 1959 season, the parish allowed the corps to once more wear the uniform that remains their trademark.\n\nIn the second half of the Sixties, the Garfield Cadets became more of an also-ran than a champion. In 1969, the corps became coed. In 1971, the Cadets marched a show they called, \"No More War\"; at VFW Nationals in Dallas. They reportedly tried to convince the VFW officials that the peace symbol in their drill was actually the Mercedes-Benz logo. Also in 1971, the Garfield Cadets, along with the 27th Lancers, Boston Crusaders, Blessed Sacrament Golden Knights, and Blue Rock, formed the United Organization of Junior Corps (also known as the \"Alliance\"). This action was taken in reaction to the rigid, inflexible rules of the American Legion and VFW (the primary rule makers and sponsors of both corps and shows) and the low or nonexistent performance fees paid for appearing in the various competitions. The corps felt that not only were they having their creative potential as artistic performing groups stifled, but they were being financially starved. (A similar group of Midwestern corps, the Midwest Combine, was formed by the Blue Stars, Cavaliers, Madison Scouts, Santa Clara Vanguard, and the Troopers.) The Alliance members felt that the corps should be making their own rules, operating their own competitions and championships, and keeping the bulk of the monies those shows earned. For the 1971 season, the corps stuck together, offering show promoters the five corps as a package. Despite pressure on show sponsors, judges, and other drum corps, the corps were booked into a number of shows together.\n\nIn 1972, the Garfield Cadets, along with the nine other corps from the Alliance and the Midwest Combine, plus the Anaheim Kingsmen, Argonne Rebels, and De La Salle Oaklands were founding members of Drum Corps International, which remains as the sanctioning body for junior corps in North America. At the first DCI World Championships in Whitewater, Wisconsin, the Cadets just missed making Finals and finished in thirteenth place in a competition that featured thirty-nine corps from the East, the South, the West Coast, the Midwest and Great Plains, and Canada. The corps would fail to make DCI Finals for the first four years they were held and for six of DCI's first eight seasons. After their third Finals appearance in 1980, the Cadets quickly regained the corps' former championship form. In 1983-85, the Garfield Cadets became the first DCI corps to earn a three-peat—three consecutive DCI titles. On July 4, 1986 the Cadets performed as a part of the Liberty Weekend celebrating both the hundredth anniversary and the restoration of the Statue of Liberty. In 1987, the corps won its fourth DCI crown in five years.\n\nThe Garfield Cadets relocated outside Garfield to Hackensack and became the Cadets of Bergen County in 1989. The Cadets of Bergen County won DCI Championships in 1990, '93, '98, and 2000. In 1996, sponsorship of the corps was passed to Youth Education in the Arts (YEA), an umbrella organization sponsoring several youth and musical activities. Also in '96, the Cadets performed at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. In 2003, Yea! and the corps moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania, and the corps dropped any reference to locale from its name, becoming simply, The Cadets.. In January 2009, The Cadets marched in President Barack Obama's Inaugural Parade in Washington, D.C. The Cadets won additional DCI championships in 2005 and 2011, the corps' ninth and tenth in forty seasons.\n\nTo honor their 75th anniversary, the corps was called the Holy Name Cadets for the 2009 season.\n\nOn April 5, 2018, allegations were made in published reports that the longstanding corps director, George Hopkins, sexually harassed or abused multiple members of the corps and staff over a period of years. Later that day, Hopkins stepped down as director of The Cadets and YEA! CEO while denying the allegations. Sean King was named as interim CEO for YEA! On April 11, 2018 the board of directors tendered its resignation and a new board and officers immediately took over operations of the organization. Claiming to have received no letter of resignation, the new board terminated Hopkins for cause. (In his federal lawsuit seeking severance pay and other monies, Hopkins asserts that he resigned from the organization by letter on April 5, and that his departure was \"mutually agreed\"-upon.) The organization also hired a Chicago labor and employment law firm, Franczek Radelet, to investigate the accusations against Hopkins as well as YEA!’s policies and procedures for providing a safe environment for youth members, employees, and volunteers. In addition, YEA! established a hotline for calls to report concerns or complaints.\n\nThe YEA! organization was immediately put on a probationary status by DCI with the statement that, \"The terms of the probation include multiple steps for YEA! to take in order for its drum corps to participate in the upcoming 2018 DCI Summer Tour.\" As a part of the terms of probation, the corps' reassessed their planned travel to the West Coast to open the season, and instead decided to proceed with a schedule redrawn for East Coast shows. The corps' compliance with the terms of probation was sufficient for DCI to allow the corps to compete in 2018, and the probation was lifted in May of 2019.\n\nOn November 13, Hopkins was indicted in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania for sexual assault, based on accusations of two women who are former employees of YEA. The charges are second-degree felonies. Hopkins surrendered to authorities, was arraigned, and was released on $50,000 bail with a preliminary hearing scheduled for December 4.\n\nIn response to Hopkins suing YEA! for more than $500,000 in severance and back pay, the organization filed a counter suit against the former director for $1.5 million in losses which it alleges to have lost due to the sexual misconduct scandal. This amount of the lawsuit includes recovery for lost sponsorships and pledged donations to The Cadets and YEA!, a major loss of participants in the US Bands program, as well as legal fees incurred due to the scandal.\n\nThe Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps is currently part of Youth Education in the Arts (YEA!), a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization that has a Board of Directors, corps directors, and staff assigned to carry out the organization's mission. In addition to The Cadets, YEA! had also sponsored the recently inactive 2016 DCA Champion Cadets2 all-age drum and bugle corps which has been put on hold until the financial situation is in a better state (November 28, 2018); USBands (formerly United States Scholastic Band Association); the Urban Arts Center Of The Lehigh Valley, which includes the Xcape Dance Studio; and YEA! Education programs including seminars, webinars, and the Music Is Cool program.\n\nAs announced on February 10, 2020, the drum corps will begin operating independently of YEA! beginning March 31, 2020.\n\n\"Source:\"\n\n\"Gold background indicates DCI Championship; pale blue background indicates DCI Class Finalist; pale green background indicates DCI semifinalist.\"\nAt the annual World Championship Finals, Drum Corps International (DCI) presents awards to the corps with the high average scores from prelims, semifinals, and finals in five captions. The Cadets have won these caption awards: \n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to 2000 and the adoption of the current scoring format, the Cadets won these captions:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many, many years, The Cadets had a distinctly recognizable maroon and cream uniform from which the corps rarely deviated until recent years. Since their founding in 1934 the uniform had gone relatively unchanged, except for the 1958 season and part of the '59 season, after they had parted company with the Holy Name parish, which refused to allow the corps to have the uniforms for that period.\n\nFor the 2005 program, \"The Zone: Dreamscapes in Four Parts with a Door,\" the corps used the normal color scheme for the uniform, but with both the back and the front appearing to be a front side. On the true front, the uniform was the normal maroon jacket, cream white pants and trim, but the \"fake\" front had maroon pants and an overlay that gave the appearance of a cream-fronted jacket with maroon trim, while the sash remained gold on either side. The shako had a visor and badge on both front and back, and the sash was white in front and maroon in back, maintaining the double-front appearance. Also, to keep with this \"twilight-zone-like\" experience, much of the marching was also done in a manner that helped make either side seem to be the correct side.\n\nIn the 2006 show, \"Volume 2: Through the Looking Glass,\" a similar trend as 2005 was followed, though this time, the \"fake\" front had a new overlay, giving the appearance of a baby blue front with different designs for each performer. The shako also was changed to appear maroon in the front and back, though the double visor was still used. Following this year, the uniform was changed back to its traditional design.\n\nIn 2011, the corps had the usual uniform design, but changed the colors in a different way. To support the show \"Between Angels and Demons,\" which had the corps split in half with one half being \"Angels,\" and the other \"Demons,\" they had the two sides wear different colors. The \"Demons\" wore a full maroon uniform (shako, plume, jacket, pants, and shoes) while the \"Angels\" wore a full white uniform, both with the exception of the yellow sash adorned by both.\n\nFor the 2012 season, the full white uniform was extended to the entire corps for their \"12.25\" Christmas season show, and the sash was changed to maroon.\n\nIn 2014, the field corps wore the traditional uniform, while the pit wore white. Through the show, panels were removed from sashes worn by the field corps, changing the color worn from light blue to gold to yellow.\n\nOn July 30, 2015, The Cadets revealed new uniforms, which were black with silver lining. To create hype for the unveiling of the new uniforms, The Cadets had a blackout on their Facebook page.\n\nIn 2017, The Cadets utilized a new uniform for their program \"The Faithful, The Fallen, The Forgiven\" consisting of full length maroon cassocks with gold shoes before changing in to a more traditional \"Cadets\" style uniform with white pants before changing once again into a full white body suit for the show's closer.\n\nIn 2018, the corps featured white, close fitting uniforms with black mis-matched, horizontal stripes with a few maroon, sparkly stripes over top. Black collars, cuffs and shoulder points were made out of a black pvc material and studded with silver buttons. The back of the uniform, shoes and gloves were entirely black. The shako was black and white striped with a black panel in the front and a black, white and maroon plume during the beginning of the season and than changed to a straight black plume with silver mylar strands.\n\n\"O Holy Name\" is sung by the corps members before every performance. The lyrics are set to the tune of \"O Tannenbaum.\"\n\n\"Rocky Point Holiday\" (or simply Rocky Point) was included in the Cadets warmup exercises after the success of their first winning show in 1983. Other pieces include \"On a Hymnsong by Phillip Bliss\" and the newest addition \"Ballet Sacra,\" both from 1993's 1st placing show, with the piece \"Mahler's Symphony No. 2\" which is the ending segment of Gustav Mahler's Second Symphony.\n\nOf the thirteen founding member corps of DCI, The Cadets are one of only four that have attended every World Championships, with the others being the Santa Clara Vanguard, The Cavaliers, and Madison Scouts. Of the four, only Santa Clara has advanced to Finals every year.\n\nThe only junior drum and bugle corps older than The Cadets is the Racine Scouts, which was founded in 1927. The Scouts, however, have not competed on the field since 2015, making The Cadets the oldest continuously active junior corps. The Govenaires, an all-age/senior corps founded in 1927, retain the title of oldest continuously active corps.\n\nWhere every other corps begins to march by \"stepping off\" on the left foot, beginning in 1985, The Cadets started stepping off on the right.\n\nThe Cadets' 2005 show \"The Zone: Dreamscapes in Four Parts with a Door\" tied the 2002 Cavaliers show \"Frameworks\" for the highest score ever achieved at DCI Finals, with a score of 99.15. This record stood for nine more years until it was broken by the undefeated 2014 Blue Devils, when their show \"Felliniesque\" earned a score of 99.650. Despite this, The Cadets' 2005 championship season remains the only one with a champion to win all captions and sub-captions. Many corps have won all of the overall captions, but only 2005 Cadets won all of the performance and ensemble subcaptions.\n\nWhile in many ways The Cadets are a very traditional corps, they have also been one of the innovators of the activity. This was especially true during their early DCI championship seasons, when they pioneered the use of complex, asymmetrical drills under the direction of drill designer George Zingali. Later, The Cadets and their then-director, George Hopkins, led the move toward the use of electronics, amplification, and vocals in drum corps.\n\n"}

{"id": "1826998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826998", "title": "Launchd", "text": "Launchd\n\nlaunchd is an init and operating system service management daemon created by Apple Inc. as part of macOS to replace its BSD-style init and SystemStarter. There have been efforts to port launchd to FreeBSD and derived systems.\n\nThere are two main programs in the launchd system: launchd and launchctl.\n\n\"launchd\" manages the daemons at both a system and user level. Similar to xinetd, launchd can start daemons on demand. Similar to watchdogd, launchd can monitor daemons to make sure that they keep running. launchd also has replaced init as PID 1 on macOS and as a result it is responsible for starting the system at boot time.\n\nConfiguration files define the parameters of services run by launchd. Stored in the LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons subdirectories of the Library folders, the property list-based files have approximately thirty different keys that can be set. launchd itself has no knowledge of these configuration files or any ability to read them - that is the responsibility of \"launchctl\".\n\n\"launchctl\" is a command line application which talks to launchd using IPC and knows how to parse the property list files used to describe launchd jobs, serializing them using a specialized dictionary protocol that launchd understands. launchctl can be used to load and unload daemons, start and stop launchd controlled jobs, get system utilization statistics for launchd and its child processes, and set environment settings.\n\nlaunchd has two main tasks. The first is to boot the system, and the second is to load and maintain services.\n\nHere is a simplified view of the Mac OS X Tiger system startup on a PowerPC Mac (on an Intel Mac, EFI replaces Open Firmware and codice_1 replaces BootX):\n\n\nIn step 4, the startup scripts scan through a few different directories for jobs to run. There are two different directories that are scanned:\nThese directories are all kept in the typical Library directories of Mac OS X.\n\nlaunchd is very different from SystemStarter in that it may not actually launch all the daemons at boot time. Key to launchd, and similar to xinetd, is the idea of launch-on-demand daemons. When launchctl scans through the job plists at boot time, it asks launchd to reserve and listen on all of the ports requested by those jobs. If so indicated in the plist by the \"OnDemand\" key, the daemon is not actually loaded at the time. Rather, launchd will listen on the port, start the daemon when needed, and shut it down when it is no longer needed. After a daemon is loaded, launchd will keep track of it and make sure it is running if needed. In this way it is like watchdogd, and shares watchdogd's requirement that processes do not attempt to fork or daemonize on their own. If a process goes into the background, launchd will lose track of it and attempt to relaunch it.\n\nMac OS X Tiger, consequently, boots much faster than previous releases. The system only has to register the daemons that are to run and does not actually launch them until they are needed. In fact, the progress bar that appears during boot time is just a placebo application (named WaitingForLoginWindow) that does not really show anything other than the passage of time.\n\nThe hardest part to manage during a launchd boot is dependencies. SystemStarter had a very simple system of dependencies that used the \"Uses\", \"Requires\", and \"Provides\" keys in the plist of a startup item. There are two main strategies when creating launchd dependencies on Tiger: IPC allows daemons to talk amongst themselves to work out dependencies, or daemons can watch files or paths for changes. Using IPC is much more subtle than the SystemStarter's keys and requires more work from the developer, but it may lead to cleaner and quicker startups. SystemStarter was still supported up to OS X Mountain Lion, but was removed in OS X Yosemite.\n\nIn launchd, control of services is centralized in the codice_5 application. \n\nOn its own, launchctl can take commands from the command line, from standard in, or operate in interactive mode. With superuser privileges, launchctl can be used to make changes on a global scale. A set of launchctl commands can be made permanent when stored in /etc/launchd.conf. (A per-user ~/.launchd.conf file appears to have been considered, but is not supported in any existing version of macOS.)\n\nlaunchctl communicates with launchd via a Mach-specific IPC mechanism.\n\nA property list (plist) is a type of file that launchd uses for program configuration. When launchd scans a folder, or a job is submitted with launchctl, it reads a plist file that describes how the program is to be run.\n\nA list of often used keys follows below. All keys are optional unless otherwise noted. For a full list, see Apple's manpage for codice_6.\n\nThe name of each key under Sockets will be placed into the environment of the job when it is run, and the file descriptor of that socket will be available in that environment variable. This differs from systemd's socket activation in that the name of a socket definition inside of the job configuration is hardcoded into the application. This protocol is less flexible, although it does not, as systemd does, require the daemon to hardcode a starting file descriptor (as of 2014, it is 3).\n\nThe software was designed and coded by Dave Zarzycki at Apple. The company planned for all of the following to be superseded in OS X environments –\n\n\n– and most of those things \"were\" superseded when launchd was introduced with Mac OS X v10.4 (Tiger). \n\nIn 2005, R. Tyler Croy ported launchd to FreeBSD as part of Google Summer of Code Project. It could not be run as PID 1 (only a session init), and it was not commonly used on that platform. \n\nIn 2006, the Ubuntu Linux distribution considered using launchd. The option was rejected because the source code was subject to the Apple Public Source License – described as an \"inescapable licence problem\". Ubuntu instead developed and switched to its own service management tool, Upstart.\n\nIn August 2006, Apple relicensed launchd under the Apache License, Version 2.0 in an effort to make adoption by other open source developers easier. Most Linux distributions use systemd or Upstart, or continue with init, and the BSDs also continue with init.\n\nIn December 2013, R. Tyler Croy announced his intent to resume work on his port of launchd to FreeBSD, and his \"openlaunchd\" Github repo subsequently rose in activity.\n\nThe last Wayback Machine capture of the Mac OS Forge area for launchd was in June 2012, and the most recent open source version from Apple was 842.92.1 in code for OS X 10.9.5. \n\nIn 2014, with OS X 10.10 and iOS 8, Apple moved code for launchd to closed source libxpc.\n\nIn August 2015 Jordan Hubbard and Kip Macy announced NextBSD, which is based on FreeBSD-CURRENT kernel while adding in Mach IPC, Libdispatch, notifyd, asld, launchd, and other components derived from Darwin, Apple's open-source code for OS X.\n\n\nApple Developer: \n\nApple Developer Retired Documents Library: \n\nOther links: \n"}

The win from the incumbent Liberal Democrat in 2015 by the Labour Party's candidate was a strong swing. The 2015 result made the seat the 137th safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.\n\nIn the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, the constituency is estimated to have voted between 66% and 82% to Remain in the EU.\n\nThe constituency was created in 1983 from the safe Conservative seat of Hornsey and the more Labour-inclined Wood Green. In those boundary changes the Wood Green seat was broadly divided into two, with half being merged with Hornsey and the rest being transferred to the neighbouring constituency of Tottenham, to the east — a very small part of the Hornsey seat was also transferred to Tottenham at the same time.\n\nThis was a Conservative Party seat until 1992 but by 1997 swung so heavily it suggested a Labour Party safe seat — Barbara Roche enjoyed a majority of over 20,000. The Liberal Democrats, however, supplanted those parties in the area, both at Parliamentary level where they won the seat in 2005 and held it until 2015; and in local terms. At the 2015 election this seat had the lowest combined Conservative and UKIP percentage in England (11.45%).\n\nThe seat had a large swing to Labour of over 15% in the 2017 general election, similar to that of two years earlier, meaning it now has a history of political volatility; in five out of the last six general elections, there have been swings to Labour or the Liberal Democrats of between 13 and 16%.\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Charles Gabriel Gaboriau, a public official and his mother was Marguerite Stéphanie Gaboriau. Gaboriau became a secretary to Paul Féval, and after publishing some novels and miscellaneous writings, found his real gift in \"L'Affaire Lerouge\" (1866).\n\n\"L'Affaire Lerouge\", which was Gaboriau's first detective novel, introduced an amateur detective. It also introduced a young police officer named Monsieur Lecoq, who was the hero in three of Gaboriau's later detective novels. The character of Lecoq was based on a real-life thief turned police officer, Eugène François Vidocq (1775–1857), whose own memoirs, \"Les Vrais Mémoires de Vidocq\", mixed fiction and fact. It may also have been influenced by the villainous Monsieur Lecoq, one of the main protagonists of Féval's \"Les Habits Noirs\" book series.\n\nThe book was published in \"Le Siècle\" and at once made his reputation. Gaboriau gained a huge following, but when Arthur Conan Doyle created Sherlock Holmes, Monsieur Lecoq's international fame declined. The story was produced on the stage in 1872. A long series of novels dealing with the annals of the police court followed, and proved very popular. Gaboriau died in Paris of pulmonary apoplexy.\n\nGaboriau's books were generally well received. About \"The Mystery of the Orcival\", \"Harper's\" wrote in 1872: \"Of its class of romance—French sensational—this is a remarkable and unique specimen\".\nA film version of \"Le Dossier n° 113\" (File No. 113) was released in 1932.\n\nIn \"A Study in Scarlet\", Arthur Conan Doyle has Watson ask Sherlock Holmes what he thinks of Gaboriau's work.

{"id": "1827014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827014", "title": "Identity document forgery", "text": "Identity document forgery\n\nIdentity document forgery is the process by which identity documents issued by governing bodies are copied and/or modified by persons not authorized to create such documents or engage in such modifications, for the purpose of deceiving those who would view the documents about the identity or status of the bearer. The term also encompasses the activity of acquiring identity documents from governing bodies by falsifying the required supporting documentation in order to create the desired identity.\n\nIdentity documents differ from other credentials in that they are intended to be usable by only the person holding the card. Unlike other credentials, they may be used to restrict the activities of the holder as well as to expand them.\n\nDocuments that have been forged in this way include driver's licenses (historically forged or altered as an attempt to conceal the fact that persons desiring to consume alcohol are under the legal drinking age); birth certificates and Social Security cards (likely used in identity theft schemes or to defraud the government); and passports (used to evade restrictions on entry into a particular country). At the beginning of 2010, there were 11 million stolen or lost passports listed in the global database of Interpol.\n\nSuch falsified documents can be used for identity theft, age deception, illegal immigration, organized crime, and espionage.\n\nA distinction needs to be made between the different uses of an identity document. In some cases, the fake ID may only have to pass a cursory inspection, such as flashing a plastic ID card for a security guard. At the other extreme, a document may have to resist scrutiny by a trained document examiner, who may be equipped with technical tools for verifying biometrics and reading hidden security features within the card. To make forgery more difficult, most modern IDs contain numerous security features that require specialised and expensive equipment to duplicate. School IDs are typically easier to fake, as they often do not have the same level of security measures as government-issued IDs.\n\nModern fake ID cards almost invariably carry a picture of the authorized user, a simple and effective form of biometric identification. However, forgery of basic photographic ID cards has become simple in recent years with the availability of low-cost high-resolution printers, scanners and photo-editing software. Basic fake ID cards are commonly made using an inkjet or laser printer to print a replica document which is then laminated to resemble a real ID card. Most designs are made using computer programs, re-creating scanned copies of a license.\n\nMore complex ID cards are now being created by printing on a material called Teslin or Artisyn, which are paper-like materials that are actually micro-porous plastic sheets. When butterfly pouches and holograms are applied, the card is then run through a heat laminator, creating a professional-looking ID card.\n\nNumerous security printing techniques have been used to attempt to enhance the security of ID cards. For example, many modern documents include holograms, which are difficult to replicate without expensive equipment not generally available. Though accurate recreation of these holograms is extremely difficult, using a mixture of pigments and base can create a similar shiny multi-coloured look that may pass cursory inspection. Another form of document security is UV-light visible ink. \n\nIn addition, some documents include a magnetic strip, which contains the similar information to that printed on the card. The data may thus be checked against other data on the card, such as printed information or a machine-readable barcode. Magnetic strips may also contain other secret identifying information. Although magnetic strips can also be faked, they provide another barrier to entry for the amateur forger. Other hidden security devices can also be added, including embedded secure cryptoprocessor chips which are designed to be very difficult to forge, and RFID tags⁠ ⁠—⁠ ⁠the two technologies may also be combined, in the case of contactless smart cards.\n\nAnother effective technique is the use of online verification of security information against a central database. In many cases, online verification can detect simple copying of a document by detecting attempted use in multiple places at the same time, or completely false IDs, as the information on the ID will be found to be invalid. A simple method of confirming that an ID is genuine is to print a serial number on it unique to the card and stored on a centralized database. If checked, it will quickly become clear that the ID is false; either the number on the ID is not registered for the holder, or no ID has the number at all. Online verification also has the advantage that it allows easy revocation of lost or stolen documents.\n\nMany modern credentials now contain some kind of barcode. For example, many U.S. driving licences include a 2-dimensional code in PDF417 format, which contains the same information as on the front of the license. Barcodes allow rapid checking of credentials for low-security applications, and may potentially contain extra information which can be used to verify other information on the card.\n\nThe combination of multiple high-security features, biometrics, and well-trained document inspectors with technical assistance can be very effective at preventing forged documents from being easily produced. Instead of acquiring the expensive specialized equipment needed to make fake documents, it may be more economical to produce a \"genuine fake\"⁠ ⁠—⁠ ⁠a legitimate document, but one which contains false information.\n\nOne way of doing this is to present the document issuing authority with false credentials, which they will then endorse by issuing a new document. In this way, false identities and credentials can be \"bootstrapped\" over a period of time.\n\nAnother simpler way of generating false credentials is to suborn one of the officials involved in the document-issuing process through bribery or intimidation. This may also be combined with the bootstrapping process mentioned above to mount complex attacks.\n\nCorruption in the document-issuing process is hard to counter, since as the value of a credential increases, the economic incentives for corruption also increase. This is particularly true in the case of fake ID cards that combine many functions in one document, and for documents which are issued in large numbers, thus requiring many thousands of people to have authorizing powers, thus creating a longer chain of people who can possibly be exploited. Detection of a \"genuine fake\" document is also a difficult process; as such a fake is a legitimate document, it will pass any tests for forgery. To detect such fakes, it is necessary to perform a background check on the individual in question to confirm the legitimacy of the document's information. \n\n"}

Located near the Oregon Zoo in Washington Park, the organization was established in 1964 as the Western Forestry Center, with the actual building opening in 1971.\n\nThe World Forestry Center has its roots in the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial American Pacific Exposition and Oriental Fair for which an enormous log cabin was built of huge native trees and advertised as the world's largest. Public interest in the Forestry Building, which was turned over to the State of Oregon, lasted long after the exposition ended, right up until it was destroyed by fire on August 17, 1964.\n\nThe day after the fire, a group of civic and industry leaders conceived The Western Forestry Center. A new, more fire-resistant forestry building designed by Oregon architect John Storrs was built in Washington Park. It opened to the public on June 5, 1971. The name was changed to \"World Forestry Center\" in 1986 to reflect the center's revised focus on forestry on a global scale.\n\nOn June 30, 2005, after a $7 million, 6-month renovation, the museum reopened with new interactive exhibits about the sustainability of forests and trees of the Pacific Northwest and the world.\n\nThe World Forestry Center's mission is to \"educate and inform people about the world's forests and trees, and their importance to all life, in order to promote a balanced and sustainable future.\"\n\nThe center achieves its mission with three programs: the Discovery Museum, two donated working forests—the Magness Memorial Tree Farm and the Johnson-Swanson Tree Farm—and the World Forest Institute which was established in 1989. The primary program is the International Fellowship Program.\n\nIn 1989, the World Forestry Center established the World Forest Institute to meet a growing demand for forestry information. As the forestry sector becomes increasingly complex, there is a greater need for international collaboration and exchange of information on forest trade, regulation, management, and forest resources. The World Forest Institute was created through the vision and support of Harry A. Merlo, a pioneer of the forest products industry, and an early visionary of the globalization of the forestry sector.\nThe fellowship program brings young forestry and forest products professionals from around the world to work at the World Forest Institute for 6 to 12 months. Fellows are commonly sponsored by their employer, government institutions, the forest industry, or an NGO, and carry out applied research projects of interest to their sponsors. In addition to completing a practical research project, the program works to get Fellows a broad exposure to natural resource management in the U.S. so that when they return to their home countries they have a basic understanding of the owners and managers of land and natural resources throughout the country.\n\nThe institute won the 2012 Portland Mayor's International Business Award from the Oregon Consular Corps. This award recognizes businesses that contribute to a global environment in Oregon.\n\nThe World Forestry Center campus also accommodates three other buildings: Julian N. Cheatham Hall, Harold A. Miller Hall and Harry A. Merlo Hall, which houses the administrative offices and the World Forest Institute.\n\nThe Leadership Hall of Fame commemorates people who have made important contributions to forestry. The photographs and biographies of nearly 200 forestry leaders are displayed in three chests constructed of select Black Walnut from the eastern U.S.\n\nParking at the World Forestry Center costs $2 per hour, to a maximum of $8 per day. The Washington Park light rail station provides regional public transit access to the World Forestry Center. Additionally, TriMet bus route 63-Washington Park provides daily service to the World Forestry Center via Washington Park.\n\n\n"}

Its publication in 1971 \"caused a sensation within the photographic community\", leading to a new interest in autobiographical work.\n\nLater better known for directing the movie \"Kids,\" Clark was a Tulsa native and a drug addict during the period (1963–1971) when he took the photographs. The book is prefaced by the statement:i was born in tulsa oklahoma in 1943. when i was sixteen i started shooting amphetamine. i shot with my friends everyday for three years and then left town but i've gone back through the years. once the needle goes in it never comes out. L.C.\n\n\"Tulsa\", Clark's first book, was published in 1971 by Lustrum Press, owned by Ralph Gibson. It has been claimed that thanks to Gene Pitney's 1960 song \"Twenty Four Hours from Tulsa\", Tulsa then represented \"young love and family values\"; Clark's book challenged this with scenes of young people having sex, shooting up drugs, and playing with guns.\n\nClark has said that he \"didn't take these photographs as a voyeur, but as a participant in the phenomenon\", and commentary on the book has emphasized how Clark did not just live with the teenagers portrayed but \"did drugs with them, slept with them, and included himself in the photographs\"; this conferred an authenticity on the work, which brought it great praise.\n\nCriticism of \"Tulsa\" has not been limited to a visceral rejection of images of drugtaking, casual sex, and gunplay; Martin Parr and Gerry Badger say that the \"incessant focus [of \"Tulsa\" and Clark's 1983 book \"Teenage Lust\"] on the sleazy aspect of the lives portrayed, to the exclusion of almost anything else — whether photographed from the 'inside' or not — raises concerns about exploitation and drawing the viewer into a prurient, voyeuristic relationship with the work.\"\n\nClark discusses his techniques in the book \"Darkroom\", published in 1977 by Lustrum Press. Referring specifically to \"Tulsa\" he says: \"I do a lot of burning and dodging when making a print and then use bleach. There's not a straight print in the TULSA book. when I'm photographing I always try to shoot against the light (refers to the cover image from \"Tulsa\" entitled 'Dead,1970'). The film can't handle this and everything gets burned up, since I'm exposing for the shadows.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1827032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827032", "title": "History of democracy", "text": "History of democracy\n\nA democracy is a political system, or a system of decision-making within an institution or organization or a country, in which all members have an equal share of power. Modern democracies are characterized by two capabilities that differentiate them fundamentally from earlier forms of government: the capacity to intervene in their own societies and the recognition of their sovereignty by an international legalistic framework of similarly sovereign states. Democratic government is commonly juxtaposed with oligarchic and monarchic systems, which are ruled by a minority and a sole monarch respectively.\n\nDemocracy is generally associated with the efforts of the ancient Greeks and Romans, who were themselves considered the founders of Western civilization by the 18th century intellectuals who attempted to leverage these early democratic experiments into a new template for post-monarchical political organization. The extent to which these 18th century democratic revivalists succeeded in turning the democratic ideals of the ancient Greeks and Romans into the dominant political institution of the next 300 years is hardly debatable, even if the moral justifications they often employed might be. Nevertheless, the critical historical juncture catalyzed by the resurrection of democratic ideals and institutions fundamentally transformed the ensuing centuries and has dominated the international landscape since the dismantling of the final vestige of empire following the end of the Second World War.\n\nModern representative democracies attempt to bridge the gulf between the Hobbesian 'state of nature' and the grip of authoritarianism through 'social contracts' that enshrine the rights of the citizens, curtail the power of the state, and grant agency through the right to vote. \nWhile they engage populations with some level of decision-making, they are defined by the premise of distrust in the ability of human populations to make a direct judgement about candidates or decisions on issues.\n\nAnthropologists have identified forms of proto-democracy that date back to small bands of hunter-gatherers that predate the establishment of agrarian, sedentary societies and still exist virtually unchanged in isolated indigenous groups today. In these groups of generally 50-100 individuals, often tied closely by familial bonds, decisions are reached by consensus or majority and many times without the designation of any specific chief. Given that these dynamics are still alive and well today, it is plausible to assume that democracy in one form or another arises naturally in any well-bonded group or tribe.\n\nThese types of democracy are commonly identified as tribalism, or \"primitive democracy\". In this sense, a \"primitive democracy\" usually takes shape in small communities or villages when there are face-to-face discussions in a village council or with a leader who has the backing of village elders or other cooperative forms of government. This becomes more complex on a larger scale, such as when the village and city are examined more broadly as political communities. All other forms of rule – including monarchy, tyranny, aristocracy, and oligarchy – have flourished in more urban centers, often those with concentrated populations.\n\nThe concepts (and name) of democracy and constitution as a form of government originated in ancient Athens circa 508 B.C. In ancient Greece, where there were many city-states with different forms of government, democracy was contrasted with governance by elites (aristocracy), by one person (monarchy), by tyrants (tyranny), etc.\n\nIn recent decades scholars have explored the possibility that advancements toward democratic government occurred somewhere else (i.e. other than Greece) first, as Greece developed its complex social and political institutions long after the appearance of the earliest civilizations in Egypt and the Near East.\n\nStudying pre-Babylonian Mesopotamia, Thorkild Jacobsen used Sumerian epic, myth, and historical records to identify what he has called \"primitive democracy\". By this, Jacobsen means a government in which ultimate power rests with the mass of free (non-slave) male citizens, although \"the various functions of government are as yet little specialised [and] the power structure is loose\". In early Sumer, kings like Gilgamesh did not hold the autocratic power that later Mesopotamian rulers wielded. Rather, major city-states functioned with councils of elders and \"young men\" (likely free men bearing arms) that possessed the final political authority, and had to be consulted on all major issues such as war.\n\nThe work has gained little outright acceptance. Scholars criticize the use of the word \"democracy\" in this context since the same evidence also can be interpreted convincingly to demonstrate a power struggle between primitive monarchy and noble classes, a struggle in which the common people function more like pawns rather than any kind of sovereign authority. Jacobsen conceded that the vagueness of the evidence prohibits the separation between the \"Mesopotamian democracy\" from a \"primitive oligarchy\".\n\nAnother claim for early democratic institutions comes from the independent \"republics\" of India, \"sanghas\" and \"ganas\", which existed as early as the 6th century B.C. and persisted in some areas until the 4th century. The evidence for this is scattered, however, and no pure historical source exists for that period. In addition, Diodorus—a Greek historian who wrote two centuries after the time of Alexander the Great's invasion of India—mentions, without offering any detail, that independent and democratic states existed in India. Modern scholars note the word \"democracy\" at the time of the 3rd century B.C. and later suffered from degradation and could mean any autonomous state, no matter how oligarchic in nature.\nKey characteristics of the \"gana\" seem to include a monarch, usually known by the name raja, and a deliberative assembly. The assembly met regularly. It discussed all major state decisions. At least in some states, attendance was open to all free men. This body also had full financial, administrative, and judicial authority. Other officers, who rarely receive any mention, obeyed the decisions of the assembly. Elected by the \"gana\", the monarch apparently always belonged to a family of the noble class of \"Kshatriya Varna\". The monarch coordinated his activities with the assembly; in some states, he did so with a council of other nobles. The Licchavis had a primary governing body of 7,077 rajas, the heads of the most important families. On the other hand, the Shakyas, Koliyas, Mallas, and Licchavis, during the period around Gautama Buddha, had the assembly open to all men, rich and poor. Early \"republics\" or Gaṇa sangha, such as Mallas, centered in the city of Kusinagara, and the Vajji (or Vriji) confederation, centered in the city of Vaishali, existed as early as the 6th century BCE and persisted in some areas until the 4th century CE. The most famous clan amongst the ruling confederate clans of the Vajji Mahajanapada were the Licchavis. The Magadha kingdom included republican communities such as the community of Rajakumara. Villages had their own assemblies under their local chiefs called Gramakas. Their administrations were divided into executive, judicial, and military functions.\n\nScholars differ over how best to describe these governments, and the vague, sporadic quality of the evidence allows for wide disagreements. Some emphasize the central role of the assemblies and thus tout them as democracies; other scholars focus on the upper-class domination of the leadership and possible control of the assembly and see an oligarchy or an aristocracy. Despite the assembly's obvious power, it has not yet been established whether the composition and participation were truly popular. The first main obstacle is the lack of evidence describing the popular power of the assembly. This is reflected in the \"Arthashastra\", an ancient handbook for monarchs on how to rule efficiently. It contains a chapter on how to deal with the \"sangas\", which includes injunctions on manipulating the noble leaders, yet it does not mention how to influence the mass of the citizens—a surprising omission if democratic bodies, not the aristocratic families, actively controlled the republican governments. Another issue is the persistence of the four-tiered Varna class system. The duties and privileges on the members of each particular caste—rigid enough to prohibit someone sharing a meal with those of another order—might have affected the roles members were expected to play in the state, regardless of the formality of the institutions. A central tenet of democracy is the notion of shared decision-making power. The absence of any concrete notion of citizen equality across these caste system boundaries leads many scholars to claim that the true nature of \"ganas\" and \"sanghas\" is not comparable to truly democratic institutions.\n\nAncient Greece, in its early period, was a loose collection of independent city states called poleis. Many of these poleis were oligarchies. The most prominent Greek oligarchy, and the state with which democratic Athens is most often and most fruitfully compared, was Sparta. Yet Sparta, in its rejection of private wealth as a primary social differentiator, was a peculiar kind of oligarchy and some scholars note its resemblance to democracy. In Spartan government, the political power was divided between four bodies: two Spartan Kings (diarchy), gerousia (\"Council of Gerontes\" (Elders), including the two kings), the ephors (representatives of the citizens who oversaw the Kings) and the apella (assembly of Spartans).\n\nThe two kings served as the head of the government. They ruled simultaneously, but they came from two separate lines. The dual kingship diluted the effective power of the executive office. The kings shared their judicial functions with other members of the gerousia. The members of the gerousia had to be over the age of 60 and were elected for life. In theory, any Spartan over that age could stand for election. However, in practice, they were selected from wealthy, aristocratic families. The gerousia possessed the crucial power of legislative initiative. Apella, the most democratic element, was the assembly where Spartans above the age of 30 elected the members of the gerousia and the ephors, and accepted or rejected gerousia's proposals. Finally, the five ephors were Spartans chosen in apella to oversee the actions of the kings and other public officials and, if necessary, depose them. They served for one year and could not be re-elected for a second term. Over the years, the ephors held great influence on the formation of foreign policy and acted as the main executive body of the state. Additionally, they had full responsibility for the Spartan educational system, which was essential for maintaining the high standards of the Spartan army. As Aristotle noted, ephors were the most important key institution of the state, but because often they were appointed from the whole social body it resulted in very poor men holding office, with the ensuing possibility that they could easily be bribed.\n\nThe creator of the Spartan system of rule was the legendary lawgiver Lycurgus. He is associated with the drastic reforms that were instituted in Sparta after the revolt of the helots in the second half of the 7th century BCE. In order to prevent another helot revolt, Lycurgus devised the highly militarized communal system that made Sparta unique among the city-states of Greece. All his reforms were directed towards the three Spartan virtues: equality (among citizens), military fitness, and austerity. It is also probable that Lycurgus delineated the powers of the two traditional organs of the Spartan government, the gerousia and the apella.\n\nThe reforms of Lycurgus were written as a list of rules/laws called Great Rhetra, making it the world's first written constitution. In the following centuries, Sparta became a military superpower, and its system of rule was admired throughout the Greek world for its political stability. In particular, the concept of equality played an important role in Spartan society. The Spartans referred to themselves as \"όμοιοι\" (\"Homoioi\", \"men of equal status\"). It was also reflected in the Spartan public educational system, agoge, where all citizens irrespective of wealth or status had the same education. This was admired almost universally by contemporaries, from historians such as Herodotus and Xenophon to philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. In addition, the Spartan women, unlike elsewhere, enjoyed \"every kind of luxury and intemperance\" including rights such as the right to inheritance, property ownership, and public education.\n\nOverall, the Spartans were remarkably free to criticize their kings and they were able to depose and exile them. However, despite these \"democratic\" elements in the Spartan constitution, there are two cardinal criticisms, classifying Sparta as an oligarchy. First, individual freedom was restricted, since as Plutarch writes \"\"no man was allowed to live as he wished\"\", but as in a \"\"military camp\"\" all were engaged in the public service of their polis. And second, the gerousia effectively maintained the biggest share of power of the various governmental bodies.\n\nThe political stability of Sparta also meant that no significant changes in the constitution were made. The oligarchic elements of Sparta became even stronger, especially after the influx of gold and silver from the victories in the Persian Wars. In addition, Athens, after the Persian Wars, was becoming the hegemonic power in the Greek world and disagreements between Sparta and Athens over supremacy emerged. These led to a series of armed conflicts known as the Peloponnesian War, with Sparta prevailing in the end. However, the war exhausted both poleis and Sparta was in turn humbled by Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BCE. It was all brought to an end a few years later, when Philip II of Macedon crushed what remained of the power of the factional city-states to his South.\n\nAthens is often regarded as the birthplace of democracy and remains an important reference-point for democracy.\n\nAthens emerged in the 7th century BCE, like many other poleis, with a dominating powerful aristocracy. However, this domination led to exploitation, creating significant economic, political, and social problems. These problems exacerbated early in the 6th century; and, as \"\"the many were enslaved to few, the people rose against the notables\"\". At the same time, a number of popular revolutions disrupted traditional aristocracies. This included Sparta in the second half of the 7th century BCE. The constitutional reforms implemented by Lycurgus in Sparta introduced a hoplite state that showed, in turn, how inherited governments can be changed and lead to military victory. After a period of unrest between the rich and poor, Athenians of all classes turned to Solon to act as a mediator between rival factions, and reached a generally satisfactory solution to their problems.\n\nSolon ( 638 –  558 BC), an Athenian (Greek) of noble descent but moderate means, was a lyric poet and later a lawmaker; Plutarch ranked him as one of the Seven Sages of the ancient world. Solon attempted to satisfy all sides by alleviating the suffering of the poor majority without removing all the privileges of the rich minority. Solon divided the Athenians into four property-classes, with different rights and duties for each. As the Rhetra did in Lycurgian Sparta, Solon formalized the composition and functions of the governmental bodies. All citizens gained the right to attend the Ecclesia (Assembly) and to vote. The Ecclesia became, in principle, the sovereign body, entitled to pass laws and decrees, elect officials, and hear appeals from the most important decisions of the courts. All but those in the poorest group might serve, a year at a time, on a new Boule of 400, which was to prepare the agenda for the Ecclesia. The higher governmental posts, those of the archons (magistrates), were reserved for citizens of the top two income groups. The retired archons became members of the Areopagus (Council of the Hill of Ares), which like the Gerousia in Sparta, was able to check improper actions of the newly powerful Ecclesia. Solon created a mixed timocratic and democratic system of institutions.\n\nOverall, Solon devised the reforms of 594 BC to avert the political, economic, and moral decline in archaic Athens and gave Athens its first comprehensive code of law. The constitutional reforms eliminated enslavement of Athenians by Athenians, established rules for legal redress against over-reaching aristocratic archons, and assigned political privileges on the basis of productive wealth rather than of noble birth. Some of Solon's reforms failed in the short term, yet he is often credited with having laid the foundations for Athenian democracy.\n\nEven though the Solonian reorganization of the constitution improved the economic position of the Athenian lower classes, it did not eliminate the bitter aristocratic contentions for control of the archonship, the chief executive post. Peisistratus became tyrant of Athens three times from 561 BCE and remained in power until his death in 527 BCE. His sons Hippias and Hipparchus succeeded him.\n\nAfter the fall of tyranny (510 BCE) and before the year 508–507 was over, Cleisthenes proposed a complete reform of the system of government, which later was approved by the popular Ecclesia. Cleisthenes reorganized the population of citizens into ten tribes, with the aim to change the basis of political organization from the family loyalties to political ones, and improve the army's organization. He also introduced the principle of equality of rights for all male citizens, isonomia, by expanding access to power to more citizens. During this period, Athenians first used the word \"democracy\" (Greek: δημοκρατία – \"rule by the people\") to define their new system of government. In the next generation, Athens entered its Golden Age, becoming a great center of literature and art. Greek victories in Persian Wars (499–449 BCE) encouraged the poorest Athenians (who participated in the military campaigns) to demand a greater say in the running of their city. In the late 460s, Ephialtes and Pericles presided over a radicalization of power that shifted the balance decisively to the poorest sections of society, by passing laws which severely limited the powers of the Council of the Areopagus and allowed thetes (Athenians without wealth) to occupy public office. Pericles became distinguished as the Athenians' greatest democratic leader, even though he has been accused of running a political machine. In the following passage, Thucydides recorded Pericles, in the funeral oration, describing the Athenian system of rule:\n\nThe Athenian democracy of Cleisthenes and Pericles was based on freedom of citizens (through the reforms of Solon) and on equality of citizens (isonomia) - introduced by Cleisthenes and later expanded by Ephialtes and Pericles. To preserve these principles, the Athenians used lot for selecting officials. Casting lots aimed to ensure that all citizens were \"\"equally\"\" qualified for office, and to avoid any corruption allotment machines were used. Moreover, in most positions chosen by lot, Athenian citizens could not be selected more than once; this rotation in office meant that no-one could build up a power base through staying in a particular position.\n\nThe courts formed another important political institution in Athens; they were composed of a large number of juries with no judges, and they were selected by lot on a daily basis from an annual pool, also chosen by lot. The courts had unlimited power to control the other bodies of the government and its political leaders. Participation by the citizens selected was mandatory, and a modest financial compensation was given to citizens whose livelihood was affected by being \"drafted\" to office. The only officials chosen by elections, one from each tribe, were the \"strategoi\" (generals), where military knowledge was required, and the \"treasurers\", who had to be wealthy, since any funds revealed to have been embezzled were recovered from a treasurer's private fortune. Debate was open to all present and decisions in all matters of policy were taken by majority vote in the Ecclesia (compare direct democracy), in which all male citizens could participate (in some cases with a quorum of 6000). The decisions taken in the Ecclesia were executed by the Boule of 500, which had already approved the agenda for the Ecclesia. The Athenian Boule was elected by lot every year and no citizen could serve more than twice.\n\nOverall, the Athenian democracy was not only \"direct\" in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people, but also \"directest\" in the sense that the people through the assembly, boule, and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business. And even though the rights of the individual (probably) were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern sense, the Athenians enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government, but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person.\nWithin the Athenian democratic environment, many philosophers from all over the Greek world gathered to develop their theories. Socrates (470-399 BCE) was the first to raise the question, further expanded by his pupil Plato (died 348/347), about the relation/position of an individual within a community. Aristotle (384–322 BCE) continued the work of his teacher, Plato, and laid the foundations of political philosophy. The political philosophy developed in Athens was, in the words of Peter Hall, \"\"in a form so complete that hardly added anyone of moment to it for over a millennium\"\". Aristotle systematically analyzed the different systems of rule that the numerous Greek city-states had and divided them into three categories based on how many ruled: the many (democracy/polity), the few (oligarchy/aristocracy), a single person (tyranny, or today: autocracy/monarchy). For Aristotle, the underlying principles of democracy are reflected in his work \"Politics\":\n\nThe Athenian democracy, in its two centuries of life-time, twice voted against its democratic constitution (both times during the crisis at the end of the Pelopponesian War of 431 to 404 BC), establishing first the Four Hundred (in 411 BCE) and second Sparta's puppet régime of the Thirty Tyrants (in 404 BCE). Both votes took place under manipulation and pressure, but democracy was recovered in less than a year in both cases. Reforms following the restoration of democracy after the overthrow of the Thirty Tyrants removed most law-making authority from the Assembly and placed it in randomly selected law-making juries known as \"nomothetai\". Athens restored its democratic constitution again after King Phillip II of Macedon (reigned 359-336 BCE) and later Alexander the Great (reigned 336–323 BCE) unified Greece, but it was politically over-shadowed by the Hellenistic empires. Finally, after the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC, Athens was restricted to matters of local administration.\n\nHowever, democracy in Athens declined not only due to external powers, but due to its citizens, such as Plato and his student Aristotle. Because of their influential works, after the rediscovery of classics during the Renaissance, Sparta's political stability was praised,\nwhile the Periclean democracy was described as a system of rule where either the less well-born, the mob (as a collective tyrant), or the poorer classes held power. Only centuries afterwards, after the publication of \"A History of Greece\" by George Grote from 1846 onwards, did modern political thinkers start to view the Athenian democracy of Pericles positively. In the late 20th century scholars re-examined the Athenian system of rule as a model of empowering citizens and as a \"post-modern\" example for communities and organizations alike.\n\nRomes history has helped preserve the concept of democracy over the centuries. The Romans invented the concept of classics and many works from Ancient Greece were preserved.\nAdditionally, the Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern (representative) democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models.\n\nRome was a city-state in Italy next to powerful neighbors; Etruscans had built city-states throughout central Italy since the 13th century BCE and in the south were Greek colonies. Similar to other city-states, Rome was ruled by a king elected by the Assemblies. However, social unrest and the pressure of external threats led in 510 BCE the last king to be deposed by a group of aristocrats led by Lucius Junius Brutus. A new constitution was crafted, but the conflict between the ruling families (patricians) and the rest of the population, the plebeians continued. The plebs were demanding for definite, written, and secular laws. The patrician priests, who were the recorders and interpreters of the statutes, by keeping their records secret used their monopoly against social change. After a long resistance to the new demands, the Senate in 454 BCE sent a commission of three patricians to Greece to study and report on the legislation of Solon and other lawmakers. When they returned, the Assembly in 451 BCE chose ten men – a \"decemviri\" – to formulate a new code, and gave them supreme governmental power in Rome for two years. This commission, under the supervision of a resolute reactionary, Appius Claudius, transformed the old customary law of Rome into Twelve Tables and submitted them to the Assembly (which passed them with some changes) and they were displayed in the Forum for all who would and could read. The Twelve Tables recognised certain rights and by the 4th century BCE, the plebs were given the right to stand for consulship and other major offices of the state.\n\nThe political structure as outlined in the Roman constitution resembled a mixed constitution and its constituent parts were comparable to those of the Spartan constitution: two consuls, embodying the monarchic form; the Senate, embodying the aristocratic form; and the people through the assemblies. The consul was the highest ranking ordinary magistrate. Consuls had power in both civil and military matters. While in the city of Rome, the consuls were the head of the Roman government and they would preside over the Senate and the assemblies. While abroad, each consul would command an army. The Senate passed decrees, which were called \"senatus consultum\" and were official advices to a magistrate. However, in practice, it was difficult for a magistrate to ignore the Senate's advice. The focus of the Roman Senate was directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict, the Senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs. Also, it managed Rome's civil administration. The requirements for becoming a senator included having at least 100,000 denarii worth of land, being born of the patrician (noble aristocrats) class, and having held public office at least once before. New Senators had to be approved by the sitting members. The people of Rome through the assemblies had the final say regarding the election of magistrates, the enactment of new laws, the carrying out of capital punishment, the declaration of war and peace, and the creation (or dissolution) of alliances. Despite the obvious power the assemblies had, in practice, the assemblies were the least powerful of the other bodies of government. An assembly was legal only if summoned by a magistrate and it was restricted from any legislative initiative or the ability to debate. And even the candidates for public office as Livy writes \"\"levels were designed so that no one appeared to be excluded from an election and yet all of the clout resided with the leading men\"\". Moreover, the unequal weight of votes was making a rare practice for asking the lowest classes for their votes.\n\nRoman stability, in Polybius’ assessment, was owing to the checks each element put on the superiority of any other: a consul at war, for example, required the cooperation of the Senate and the people if he hoped to secure victory and glory, and could not be indifferent to their wishes. This was not to say that the balance was in every way even: Polybius observes that the superiority of the Roman to the Carthaginian constitution (another mixed constitution) at the time of the Hannibalic War was an effect of the latter's greater inclination toward democracy than to aristocracy. Moreover, recent attempts to posit for Rome personal freedom in the Greek sense – \"eleutheria\": living as you like – have fallen on stony ground, since \"eleutheria\" (which was an ideology and way of life in the democratic Athens) was anathema in the Roman eyes. Rome's core values included order, hierarchy, discipline, and obedience. These values were enforced with laws regulating the private life of an individual. The laws were applied in particular to the upper classes, since the upper classes were the source of Roman moral examples.\n\nRome became the ruler of a great Mediterranean empire. The new provinces brought wealth to Italy, and fortunes were made through mineral concessions and enormous slave run estates. Slaves were imported to Italy and wealthy landowners soon began to buy up and displace the original peasant farmers. By the late 2nd century this led to renewed conflict between the rich and poor and demands from the latter for reform of the constitution. The background of social unease and the inability of the traditional republican constitutions to adapt to the needs of the growing empire led to the rise of a series of over-mighty generals, championing the cause of either the rich or the poor, in the last century BCE.\n\nOver the next few hundred years, various generals would bypass or overthrow the Senate for various reasons, mostly to address perceived injustices, either against themselves or against poorer citizens or soldiers. One of those generals was Julius Caesar, where he marched on Rome and took supreme power over the republic. Caesar's career was cut short by his assassination at Rome in 44 BCE by a group of Senators including Marcus Junius Brutus. In the power vacuum that followed Caesar's assassination, his friend and chief lieutenant, Marcus Antonius, and Caesar's grandnephew Octavian who also was the adopted son of Caesar, rose to prominence. Their combined strength gave the triumvirs absolute power. However, in 31 BC war between the two broke out. The final confrontation occurred on 2 September 31 BCE, at the naval Battle of Actium where the fleet of Octavian under the command of Agrippa routed Antony's fleet. Thereafter, there was no one left in the Roman Republic who wanted to, or could stand against Octavian, and the adopted son of Caesar moved to take absolute control. Octavian left the majority of Republican institutions intact, though he influenced everything using personal authority and ultimately controlled the final decisions, having the military might to back up his rule if necessary. By 27 BCE the transition, though subtle, disguised, and relying on personal power over the power of offices, was complete. In that year, Octavian offered back all his powers to the Senate, and in a carefully staged way, the Senate refused and titled Octavian \"Augustus\" — \"the revered one\". He was always careful to avoid the title of \"rex\" — \"king\", and instead took on the titles of \"princeps\" — \"first citizen\" and \"imperator\", a title given by Roman troops to their victorious commanders.\n\nThe Roman Empire had been born. Once Octavian named Tiberius as his heir, it was clear to everyone that even the hope of a restored Republic was dead. Most likely, by the time Augustus died, no one was old enough to know a time before an Emperor ruled Rome. The Roman Republic had been changed into a despotic régime, which, underneath a competent and strong Emperor, could achieve military supremacy, economic prosperity, and a genuine peace, but under a weak or incompetent one saw its glory tarnished by cruelty, military defeats, revolts, and civil war.\n\nThe Roman Empire was eventually divided between the Western Roman Empire which fell in 476 AD and the Eastern Roman Empire (also called the Byzantine Empire) which lasted until the fall of Constantinople in 1453 AD.\n\n\nMost of the procedures used by modern democracies are very old. Almost all cultures have at some time had their new leaders approved, or at least accepted, by the people; and have changed the laws only after consultation with the assembly of the people or their leaders. Such institutions existed since before the times of the \"Iliad\" or of the \"Odyssey\", and modern democracies are often derived from or inspired by them, or what remained of them.\n\nNevertheless, the direct result of these institutions was not always a democracy. It was often a narrow oligarchy, as in Venice, or even an absolute monarchy, as in Florence, in the Renaissance period; but during the medieval period guild democracies did evolve.\n\nEarly institutions included:\n\n\nHistorian Jack Weatherford has argued that the ideas leading to the United States Constitution and democracy derived from various indigenous peoples of the Americas including the Iroquois. Weatherford claimed this democracy was founded between the years 1000–1450, and lasted several hundred years, and that the U.S. democratic system was continually changed and improved by the influence of Native Americans throughout North America.\n\nTemple University professor of anthropology and an authority on the culture and history of the Northern Iroquois Elizabeth Tooker has reviewed these claims and concluded they are myth rather than fact. The idea that North American Indians had a democratic culture is several decades old, but not usually expressed within historical literature. The relationship between the Iroquois League and the Constitution is based on a portion of a letter written by Benjamin Franklin and a speech by the Iroquois chief Canasatego in 1744. Tooker concluded that the documents only indicate that some groups of Iroquois and white settlers realized the advantages of a confederation, and that ultimately there is little evidence to support the idea that eighteenth century colonists were knowledgeable regarding the Iroquois system of governance.<ref name=\"Tooker E 1990 https://books.google.com/books?id=ARbVmr941TsC&pg=PA107#v=onepage&q&f=false 107–128\"></ref>\n\nWhat little evidence there is regarding this system indicates chiefs of different tribes were permitted representation in the Iroquois League council, and this ability to represent the tribe was hereditary. The council itself did not practice representative government, and there were no elections; deceased chiefs' successors were selected by the most senior woman within the hereditary lineage in consultation with other women in the clan. Decision making occurred through lengthy discussion and decisions were unanimous, with topics discussed being introduced by a single tribe. Tooker concludes that \"...there is virtually no evidence that the framers borrowed from the Iroquois\" and that the myth is largely based on a claim made by Iroquois linguist and ethnographer J.N.B. Hewitt which was exaggerated and misinterpreted after his death in 1937.\n\nThe Aztecs also practiced elections, but the elected officials elected a supreme speaker, not a ruler.\n\n\n\n\nThe notion of a secret ballot, where one is entitled to the privacy of their votes, is taken for granted by most today by virtue of the fact that it is simply considered the norm. However, this practice was highly controversial in the 19th century; it was widely argued that no man would want to keep his vote secret unless he was ashamed of it.\n\nThe two earliest systems used were the Victorian method and the South Australian method. Both were introduced in 1856 to voters in Victoria and South Australia. The Victorian method involved voters crossing out all the candidates whom he did not approve of. The South Australian method, which is more similar to what most democracies use today, had voters put a mark in the preferred candidate's corresponding box. The Victorian voting system also was not completely secret, as it was traceable by a special number.\n\nThe end of the First World War was a temporary victory for democracy in Europe, as it was preserved in France and temporarily extended to Germany. Already in 1906 full modern democratic rights, universal suffrage for all citizens was implemented constitutionally in Finland as well as a proportional representation, open list system. Likewise, the February Revolution in Russia in 1917 inaugurated a few months of liberal democracy under Alexander Kerensky until Lenin took over in October. The terrible economic impact of the Great Depression hurt democratic forces in many countries. The 1930s became a decade of dictators in Europe and Latin America.\n\nIn 1918 the United Kingdom granted the women over 30 who met a property qualification the right to vote, a second one was later passed in 1928 granting women and men equal rights. On August 18, 1920 the Nineteenth Amendment (Amendment XIX) to the United States Constitution was adopted which prohibits the states and the federal government from denying the right to vote to citizens of the United States on the basis of sex. French women got the right to vote in 1944, but did not actually cast their ballot for the first time until April 29, 1945.\n\nThe Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted full U.S. citizenship to America's indigenous peoples, called \"Indians\" in this Act. (The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees citizenship to persons born in the U.S., but only if \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\"; this latter clause excludes certain indigenous peoples.) The act was signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on 2 June 1924. The act further enfranchised the rights of peoples resident within the boundaries of the United States.\n\nWorld War II was ultimately a victory for democracy in Western Europe, where representative governments were established that reflected the general will of their citizens. However, many countries of Central and Eastern Europe became undemocratic Soviet satellite states. In Southern Europe, a number of right-wing authoritarian dictatorships (most notably in Spain and Portugal) continued to exist.\n\nJapan had moved towards democracy during the Taishō period during the 1920s, but it was under effective military rule in the years before and during World War II. The country adopted a new constitution during the postwar Allied occupation, with initial elections in 1946.\n\nWorld War II also planted seeds of democracy outside Europe and Japan, as it weakened, with the exception of the USSR and the United States, all the old colonial powers while strengthening anticolonial sentiment worldwide. Many restive colonies/possessions were promised subsequent independence in exchange for their support for embattled colonial powers during the war.\n\nIn 1946, the United States granted independence to the Philippines, which preserved a democratic political system as a presidential republic until the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nThe aftermath of World War II also resulted in the United Nations' decision to partition the British Mandate into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. On 14 May 1948 the state of Israel declared independence and thus was born the first full democracy in the Middle East. Israel is a representative democracy with a parliamentary system and universal suffrage.\n\nIndia became a Democratic Republic in 1950 after achieving independence from Great Britain in 1947. After holding its first national elections in 1952, India achieved the status of the world's largest liberal democracy with universal suffrage which it continues to hold today. Most of the former British and French colonies were independent by 1965 and at least initially democratic; those that were formerly part of the British Empire often adopted the Westminster parliamentary system. The process of decolonisation created much political upheaval in Africa and parts of Asia, with some countries experiencing often rapid changes to and from democratic and other forms of government.\n\nIn the United States of America, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act enforced the 15th Amendment. The 24th Amendment ended poll taxing by removing all tax placed upon voting, which was a technique commonly used to restrict the African American vote. The Voting Rights Act also granted voting rights to all Native Americans, irrespective of their home state. The minimum voting age was reduced to 18 by the 26th Amendment in 1971.\n\nNew waves of democracy swept across Southern Europe in the 1970s, as a number of right-wing nationalist dictatorships fell from power. Later, in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, the communist states in the USSR sphere of influence were also replaced with liberal democracies.\n\nMuch of Eastern Europe, Latin America, East and Southeast Asia, and several Arab, central Asian and African states, and the not-yet-state that is the Palestinian Authority moved towards greater liberal democracy in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nAn analysis by the U.S. Government funded Freedom House shows that there was not a single liberal democracy with universal suffrage in the world in 1900, but that in 2000, 120 of the world's 192 nations, or 62% were such democracies. They count 25 nations, or 13% of the world's nations with \"restricted democratic practices\" in 1900 and 16, or 8% of the world's nations today. They counted 19 constitutional monarchies in 1900, forming 14% of the world's nations, where a constitution limited the powers of the monarch, and with some power devolved to elected legislatures, and none in the present. Other nations had, and have, various forms of non-democratic rule. While the specifics may be open to debate (for example, New Zealand actually enacted universal suffrage in 1893, but is discounted due to a lack of complete sovereignty and certain restrictions on the Māori vote), the numbers are indicative of the expansion of democracy during the twentieth century.\n\nThe 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq led to a toppling of President Saddam Hussein and a new constitution with free and open elections.. Later, around 2011, the Arab Spring led to much upheavel, as well as to the establishing of a democracy in Tunisia and some increased democratic rights in Morocco. Egypt saw a temporary democracy before the re-establishment of military rule. The Palestinian Authority also took action to address democratic rights.\n\nIn Africa, out of 55 countries, democratization seems almost stalled since 2005 because of the resistance of some 20 non-democratic regimes, most of which originated in the 1980s.. In exception to this, in 2016, after losing an election, the president of the Gambia attempted to cling to power but a threatened regional military intervention forced him to leave.\n\nIn Asia, Myanmar (also known as Burma) the ruling military junta in 2011 made changes to allow certain voting-rights and released a prominent figure in the National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi, from house arrest. Myanmar did not allow Suu Kyi to run for election. However, conditions partially changed with the election of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party and her appointment as the \"de facto\" leader of Burma (Myanmar) with the title \"state councellor\", as she is still not allowed to become president and therefore leads through a figurehead, Htin Kyaw. Human rights, however, have not improved. In Bhutan, in December 2005, the 4th King Jigme Singye Wangchuck announced that the first general elections would take place in 2008, and that he would abdicate the throne in favor of his eldest son. Bhutan is currently undergoing further changes to allow for a constitutional monarchy. In the Maldives, protests and political pressure led to a government reform which allowed democratic rights and presidential elections in 2008. These were however undone by a coup in 2018.\n\nUkraine saw several protest movements leading to a switch from effective oligarchy to more democracy; , since the Maidan revolution of February 2014 Ukraine has seen two presidential elections and the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nNot all movement has promoted democracy, however. In Poland and Hungary, so-called \"illiberal democracies\" have taken hold, with the ruling parties in both countries considered by the EU and by civil society to be working to undermine democratic governance. Meanwhile, in Thailand military junta twice overthrew democratically elected governments (2006 and 2014) and in 2014 changed the constitution in order to increase their own power. The authoritarian regime of Hun Sen in Cambodia\ndissolved the main opposition party (Cambodia National Rescue Party) in 2017 and effectively implemented a one-man dictatorship.\nLarge parts of the world, such as China, Russia, Central and South East Asia, the Middle East and much of Africa have consolidated authoritarian rule rather seeing it weaken.\n\nIn 2018 dictatorships in Sudan and Algeria fell; it remains unclear what type of regimes will emerge in these two countries.\n\nUnder the influence of the theory of deliberative democracy, there have been several experiments since the start of the new millennium with what are called deliberative fora, places (in real life or in cyber space) where citizens and their representatives assemble to exchange reasons. One type of deliberative forum is called a minpublic: a body of randomly chosen or actively selected citizens that represents the whole population. The use of random selection to form a representative deliberative body is known as sortition. Examples of this are citizens' assemblies and citizens' juries. Citizens' assemblies have been used in Canada (2004, 2006) and the Netherlands (2006) to debate electoral reform, and in Iceland (2009 and 2010) for broader constitutional change.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her first piece, \"The Chapter of Accidents\", a three-act drama based on Denis Diderot's \"Le père de famille\", was produced by George Colman the Elder at the Haymarket Theatre on 5 August 1780 and was an immediate success.\n\nWhen her father died in 1781, Lee spent the proceeds of the play on establishing a school at Bath, where she made a home for her sisters Anne and Harriet. Her novel \"The Recess, or a Tale of other Times\" (1783–85) was a historical romance. \"The Recess\" is set in Elizabethan times and revolves around two fictional daughters of Mary, Queen of Scots. Lee also wrote the play \"Almeyda, Queen of Grenada\" (1796) was a long tragedy in blank verse, which opened at Drury Lane on 20 April 1796 but ran for only five nights.\n\n\"The Recess\" can also be regarded as a formative work of the original Gothic, echoing and pre-dating themes from other contemporary Gothic writers. It was so popular that a spin-off novelette appeared in 1820, \"Rose Douglas; or, The Court of Elizabeth\" William Hazlitt might consider it \"dismal\" by comparison with the works of Ann Radcliffe, but its influence both on the Gothic school of the Minerva Press, and on figures like Walter Scott is nonetheless clear.

{"id": "1827041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827041", "title": "The Mind of an Ape", "text": "The Mind of an Ape\n\nThe Mind of an Ape is a 1983 book by David Premack and his wife Ann James Premack. The authors argue that it is possible to teach language to (non-human) great apes. They write: \"We now know that someone who comprehends speech must know language, even if he or she cannot produce it.\"\n\nDavid Premack, emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, and Ann James Premack, a science writer, began teaching language to apes in 1964. Premack started his work at the Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology in Orange Park, Florida, a program at the University of Florida, continued it at the University of Missouri, then at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe subjects of the program, nine chimpanzees, were reared in a laboratory environment specifically designed to stimulate their intellect, as animals raised otherwise fail to thrive. This was in contrast to the traditional psychology lab where the animals are caged and remain in solitude. Sarah, born in 1962, demonstrated use of an invented language. Gussie failed to learn any words. Elizabeth and Peony were trained in the language. Walnut, a late arrival, also was trained in the language, but failed to learn any words. Jessie, Sadie, Bert, and Luvie, 1975 controls, were not trained in the language, but demonstrated pointing.\n\nThe language designed by Premack for an ape was not verbal; Premack's chimpanzee program differed from that of a separate research program in which other chimpanzees were raised in a human family in parallel with human babies, and taught words. Eventually, the chimpanzees might get to a two-year-old human's list of words, but no further. Vicki was eventually trained to speak four words. The experiments with those chimpanzees did not demonstrate the existence of the faculties shown by Sarah discussed below, in her command of a language, for example. In other experiments, other chimpanzees have been taught American Sign Language (ASL), notably Washoe. Washoe could use 68 gestures after three years of training, eventually getting to 150 gestures. However, Nim, trained in ASL, was found to demonstrate no forms with grammar, his linguistic productions being sets of gestures in no particular order. Koko and Chantek were also trained in ASL. See also Kanzi's 400-word vocabulary of spontaneous productions as of 2005.\n\nThe language consisted of a series of colored plastic tokens, which the chimpanzees could manipulate and stick to a magnetic board. Each token stood for a word which was never spoken in the chimpanzee's presence. Sarah began her language training in 1967 at age 5, beginning with food exchanges, to establish a social exchange with the instructor. The Premacks note that the chimpanzees \"gave\" food reluctantly and unwillingly, far preferring to \"receive\" food. In a series of experiments, Premack was able to train Sarah, Elizabeth, and Peony to parse sentences:\nwhich might result in Peony touching the trainer's nose.\nThe tokens did not resemble the objects; an apple was symbolized by a blue triangle token. The chimpanzee Elizabeth would be symbolized by a decorated E token, a copy of which would dangle from a necklace around her neck. The trainer would also wear a corresponding token, as would other investigators whom the chimpanzee would have to name in the formation of the target sentence. It took Sarah, Elizabeth, and Peony each hundreds of trials to first form an association between the tokens and the objects. Sarah in particular was trained in the token manipulations for 18 months. Sarah was able to learn imperative sentences with a grammar, \nin which the trainer allowed her to take the bread and jam, and also negative sentences\nin which the trainer restrained her from taking the cracker and honey, which taught Sarah to suppress her impulse to take the negated object. In particular, the noun had to be at the beginning and the verb had to be at the end of the production, or else the trainer would not respond to Sarah's ungrammatical sentence. After hundreds of trials, Sarah could reliably produce the grammatical form\n\n\n\n\nSarah was also able to answer questions in the form of a question token \"?\" which she could answer by selecting a resolving token. However, Sarah was never able to ask questions by manipulating the \"?\" token. The question \"What is the color of apple?\"\nwould be answered with the token for 'red' (a gray curved token).\n\nPremack was able to demonstrate that Sarah could understand how to decode a symbol stream after training. First, she had to learn the token \"name-of\" and then learn that some new, but real objects had the name-of \"fig token1\" and \"crackerjack token2\".\n\nShe learned\nand\n\nShe was tested with\nwhich she answered correctly with \n\nFinally, with the trainer placing a ripe fig on the table, and the tokens \"fig token1\", \"crackerjack token2\", give, Mary, Sarah, orange, banana, Sarah produced the new sentence\nand with the trainer placing a crackerjack on the table, Sarah produced the new sentence\n\nSarah, Peony, and Elizabeth were able to respond to and formulate analogies and to express judgements. In these trials, problems were formulated by videotaped situations involving an actor, both friendly and unfriendly. With no training, and with observation of the laboratory only, Sarah was able to select answers requiring judgement, based on her experiences in the laboratory, such as the fact that a light cord had to be plugged in to solve some problems. Sarah was able to select proposed solutions for resolving the situations.\n\nSarah was most accurate on judgements of sameness, less so on similarity, and least accurate on judgements of difference. Human children were then tested with the same protocols, using speech. Young children passed the tests on number, but failed on tests measuring conservation of liquid and solid. Five- to six-year-old children passed the tests on conservation of liquid and solid, suggesting a similar process for the cognition of measurement of conservation of liquid and solid, between ape and human.\n\nSarah was able to parse the following sentence in a way to give her the most reward:\nIn this sentence, if Sarah were to take the apple, then Mary, the trainer, would give her the chocolate, but if Sarah were to take the banana, then Mary would not give her the chocolate.\n\nThe chimpanzees do not spontaneously point outside of the psychological laboratory. The control chimpanzees, which were not trained in the language, could all point to communicate with the trainers.\n\nThe chimpanzees of Premack's laboratory were not able to navigate given training on a map, unless the map was an exact-scale replica of the mission situation.\n\nNot all individuals in a given species have equivalent capabilities to produce spontaneous communications. Washoe,\n\nThe Premacks note that chimpanzees use some gestures with each other, which the trainers use to communicate with both the language-trained chimpanzees and the control chimpanzees.\n\nThe Premacks stated that the chimpanzees had specific traits, such as favorite trainers, and that some chimpanzees, such as Gussie, seemed more fearful than the others. As previously noted, the Premacks noticed that Jessie seemed to be the brightest of the nine chimpanzee subjects. For example, she did not hesitate to unmask a masked researcher, which none of the other chimpanzees attempted.

Since 1994, its Member of Parliament has been Margaret Hodge DBE.\n\nThe area has elected Labour MPs since its creation in 1945, on strong majorities of 20.4% of the vote or greater; except for results in 1983 and 1987.\n\nThe rise in support for the British National Party since the turn of the 21st century saw the party attain 17% of the vote at the 2005 general election. Party members and supporters were optimistic that the party would soon make the breakthrough into UK parliament, and party leader Nick Griffin stood in Barking for the 2010 general election. However, his performance in Barking was poor as he polled 14.8% of the vote (which actually represented a decline in percentage terms compared to 2005) and Margaret Hodge retained the seat with more than half of the vote. During the run-up to the 2010 election, filmmaker Laura Fairrie had access to the British National Party and Labour Party campaigns and later produced a documentary \"The Battle for Barking\", which was premiered on More 4 on 30 November 2010.\n\nBucking the national trend, the incumbent MP Margaret Hodge almost doubled her majority at the 2010 general election.\n\nSet in the east of Greater London, the Barking constituency is one of the areas identified for London's planned expansion in housing. The Barking Riverside regeneration project aims to create new homes, jobs and services on the site of the former power station.\n\nHaving returned Labour MPs since 1945, Margaret Hodge has served as the MP for the seat since 1994. A challenge from the BNP in 2005 saw the Labour vote reduced by over 13% from the 2001 general election. The BNP, with 16.9% of the vote, out-polled the Liberal Democrats for third place and were 27 votes behind the Conservatives.\n\nAccording to 2011 United Kingdom census data, the seat had the 21st highest proportion of unemployed people amongst constituencies in England and Wales, at 7.4%. It also has the third-highest proportion of people from Africa, while one in six identifies as Asian/Asian British. In 2010, Labour won with 54.3% of the vote, Conservatives 17.8%, BNP 14.6%.\n\nIn 2015, the UKIP vote increased to almost 23%, this was predicted as they came the runners up in every ward in the 2014 Barking and Dagenham Council election, they came within 200 votes of winning 4 seats on the council.\n\nIn 2017, the UKIP vote collapsed, and Labour and the Conservatives both increased their share of the vote, although Labour's increase of 10.1% saw them claim 67.8% of the vote overall (their largest share in Barking at any election since the 1994 by-election and the greatest at a general election since 1970), increasing their majority from 35.5% to 45.3%.\n\nThe constituency has benefited from the 2012 Summer Olympics in London and its districts include a larger than average proportion of social housing and earners on low incomes.\n\n1945–1974: The Municipal Borough of Barking.\n\n1974–1983: The London Borough of Barking wards of Abbey, Cambell, Gascoigne, Longbridge, and Manor.\n\n1983–1997: The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham wards of Abbey, Cambell, Eastbury, Gascoigne, Goresbrook, Longbridge, Manor, Parsloes, and Thames.\n\n1997–2010: The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham wards of Abbey, Becontree, Cambell, Eastbury, Gascoigne, Goresbrook, Longbridge, Manor, Parsloes, and Thames.\n\n2010–present: The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham wards of Abbey, Alibon, Becontree, Eastbury, Gascoigne, Goresbrook, Longbridge, Mayesbrook, Parsloes, Thames, and Valence.\n\nFollowing their review of parliamentary representation the Boundary Commission for England recommended that the wards of Alibon, Parsloes and Valence be transferred from the old Dagenham constituency to Barking, and that following a review of ward boundaries a small part of River ward be transferred from Barking to help form the new Dagenham and Rainham constituency. These boundaries were first contested for the 2010 general election.\n\nUnder this review, consulted on in 2016, Alibon and Valence Wards would transfer out to Dagenham-and-Rainham constituency, and Goodmayes and Mayfield Wards would transfer in from Ilford South constituency.\n\n<section begin=\"By-election 1994\"/>\n\n<section end=\"By-election 1994\"/>\n\n\n"}

Sarah was one of nine chimpanzees in David Premack's psychology laboratory in Pennsylvania. Sarah was born in Africa in 1959. She first worked in Missouri, then in Santa Barbara, and then Pennsylvania. She first was exposed to language token training in 1967.\n\nSarah was the subject, along with three other chimpanzees which were exposed to language token training. One of the chimpanzees failed to learn a single word, but Sarah, Elizabeth, and Peony were able to parse and also produce streams of tokens which obeyed a grammar.\n\nShe used a special board with plastic symbols to correctly parse various syntactic expressions including if-then-else.\n\nWhen the Premacks decided they no longer wanted to work with chimpanzees in 1987, Sarah was sent to Sarah Boysen's Chimp Center at the Ohio State University, where she lived and worked with other enculturated chimpanzees: Kermit, Darrell, Bobby, Sheba, Keeli, Ivy, Harper, and Emma. In February 2006, the Chimp Center was closed and OSU sent the chimps to a private animal collection in Texas, and subsequently transferred to another chimpanzee sanctuary, Chimp Haven, in Louisiana, where she was well-known for her blanket nesting techniques.

The regional airline operated scheduled services in mainland Portugal and to Madeira, as well as scheduled passenger services in France and charter services to the United Kingdom and Spain, from bases at Lisbon(-Portela de Sacavem) and Funchal/Madeira(-Santa Cruz/Santa Catarina), and its flight school in Cascais(-Tires) Aerodrome.\n\nThe airline began operations in 1975, under the auspices of the \"Aerocondor Group\". Aerocondor was founded by former Colonel in the Portuguese Air Force, Victor Brito, with the assistance of his oldest son, Victor João Brito. During the course of its first years, the airline operated regular flights between Bragança and Vila Real, with particular flights of passengers and cargo to destinations in Europe, Africa and Middle East. It operated a small fleet of robust bi-motor turbohelice aircraft.\n\nThe need for qualified pilots lead the Aerocondor Group to provide flight-training school operations. This sector was enhanced with the addition of Victor Brito's second oldest son, José Manuel Brito, who served as vice-president of the company.\n\nIt was owned by Aerocondor SGPS (85.15%) and Gestair Group (14.85%) and had 90 employees, with headquarters at Cascais-Tires Aerodrome.\n\nIn May 2008, the airline suspended scheduled domestic operations in Portugal.\n\nYet, as flight operations failed, its aviation school continued to grow, under the hands of Spanish investors who changed its name to Gestair (between 2010 and 2013), when it became part of the GAir Group. Under this umbrella GAir Training Centres expanded flight school bases into Bergamo (Italy), Madrid (Spain) and a new base northeast of their headquarters in Ponte de Sor, supported by an investment of over 50 million euros. This provided the company with capital to develop an ambitious plan to train the next generation of pilots, offering training and installation services in a multicultural environment. After one year the school changed their headquarters from their base in Cascais to Ponte de Sor. It was integrated into the L3 Commercial Training Solutions company, one of the largest pilot training facilities, along with CTC Aviation (now L3 CTC).\n\nAerocondor operated services to the following scheduled domestic destinations:\nIn addition, it served international seasonal services to and from Agen and Bragança, as well as charter fights between the islands of Madeira and Porto Santo.\n\nSince June 2008, Aerocondor is not in possession of any aircraft any more due to financial problems.

Daniel in command.\n\n\"Ammen\" put to sea on 30 March bound for San Diego where she completed her shakedown training. The destroyer departed San Diego on 20 April and arrived in San Pedro the following day. Two days later, she embarked upon a voyage to Alaskan waters as part of the screen for Task Force 51 (TF 51), built around . The task force arrived at Cold Bay, Alaska, on 1 May and, 10 days later, participated in the landings on Attu Island. During that operation, \"Ammen\"s primary responsibility consisted of providing antisubmarine and antiaircraft protection for the ships of the invasion force. Since the air threat never materialized and the submarine menace proved almost as benign, she fired no shots at the enemy but struggled mightily against the inhospitable Aleutian climate.\n\nAt the conclusion of her part in the operation, \"Ammen\" headed back to California, arriving in San Diego on 31 May. The destroyer underwent two weeks of repairs at San Diego and then moved north to San Francisco where she resumed post-shakedown availability. On 11 July, she departed San Francisco in the screen of another convoy bound for Alaska. She escorted the convoy to a point about 900 miles from Adak Island where other escorts took over the mission. \"Ammen\" returned to San Francisco on 21 July but remained there only eight days. On 29 July, the destroyer put to sea with another Alaska-bound convoy. She shepherded her charges into port at Adak on 5 August and began preparations for the occupation of Kiska. That operation proved to be a walkover for the simple reason that the Japanese had evacuated Kiska. The destroyer returned to Adak on 12 September and remained there until 24 September. She put to sea again on the 24th, made a brief stop back at Kiska on the 25th, and then headed on to Pearl Harbor. \"Ammen\" arrived at her destination on 2 October and spent the ensuing nine days practicing gunnery, torpedo, and antisubmarine warfare (ASW) techniques. On 11 October, she departed Pearl Harbor in company with . The destroyer arrived back at Adak on 16 October and, for the next six weeks patrolled in the Aleutian Islands.\n\nOn 26 November, \"Ammen\" left Adak bound for the southwestern Pacific. She made a five-day stop at Pearl Harbor before resuming her voyage on 9 December. Steaming by way of Funafuti in the Ellice Islands and Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides, the warship arrived at Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 18 December. There, she became a unit of the 7th Fleet. For the next nine months, \"Ammen\" focused her energies on the series of operations that wrested control of the northern coast of New Guinea from the Japanese and isolated their big bases in the Bismarck Archipelago at Rabaul on New Britain and Kavieng on New Ireland. Between late December 1943 and late January 1944, \"Ammen\" supported the Allied landings at Cape Gloucester on the western end of New Britain as an element of the Cruiser Bombardment Unit under Rear Admiral V.A.C. Crutchley VC, RN. In addition to providing antisubmarine and antiaircraft protection for the larger ships, she transported casualties from the battle ashore and conducted shore bombardments.\n\nIn February, the destroyer visited Sydney, Australia, returning to the New Guinea area at Milne Bay on 22 February. A week later, \"Ammen\" put to sea in the screen of an LST task unit, the first resupply echelon for the reconnaissance in force of Los Negros Island that burgeoned into the occupation of the Admiralty Islands. During the first half of March, \"Ammen\" busied herself providing gunfire support for the soldiers securing a hold on Los Negros and fighting off air attacks. Between 17 and 19 March, she joined , , , and in a fruitless anti-shipping sweep along the coast of New Guinea near enemy-held Wewak.\n\nAfter several weeks of upkeep at Milne Bay and training exercises in that vicinity, \"Ammen\" put to sea once again on 18 April in company with Rear Admiral Crutchley's cruiser-destroyer force to support the next hop in the leapfrog along the northern coast of New Guinea-the Aitape-Hollandia invasion. During the assault at Tanamerah Bay, the destroyer provided antisubmarine and antiaircraft protection to gunfire support ships of the force and contributed her share of call fire as well. Later, she joined the screen of Task Group 78.2 (TG 78.2), one of two escort carrier task groups providing close air support for the troops ashore, until the middle of the first week in May.\n\nAfter a respite at Manus, \"Ammen\" departed Seeadler Harbor in mid-May in company again with Admiral Crutchley's Australian and American cruisers and destroyers. The warships steamed to Hollandia, New Guinea, where they took station offshore to cover the invasion force assembled there. After sundown on 16 May, the entire force began the voyage to the Wakde-Sarmi area of northwestern New Guinea. From 17 to 21 May, \"Ammen\" and her consorts brought their guns to bear on Japanese targets in support of the troops charged with the seizure of the region. On 27 May, the destroyer was off Biak in the Schouten Islands located just to the north of the western end of New Guinea and, due east of the peninsula then known as the Vogelkop. During the amphibious assault at Bosnik on the southeastern coast of Biak, \"Ammen\"s guns struck at enemy positions once more. After the initial landings, \"Ammen\"s cruiser-destroyer force alternated with Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey's TF 75 built around , , and in covering the invasion forces from enemy air and naval interference. \"Ammen\"s group fought off several half-hearted air attacks and foiled an attempted reinforcement by destroyers on the night of 8–9 June. The destroyer and her colleagues concluded their part in the Biak operation at the end of the third week in June and entered Seeadler Harbor for a week of upkeep.\n\nOn 30 June, the warship put to sea in the screen of the bombardment force assigned to the seizure of Noemfoor, an island located between Biak and the Vogelkop. During the landings on 2 July, \"Ammen\" drew no gunfire support missions and so, contented herself with antisubmarine and antiaircraft defense patrols against an enemy notable only for his absence. Between the conclusion of her part in the Noemfoor occupation and the Sansapor operation late in July, the destroyer carried out harassment missions against bypassed Japanese garrisons on the New Guinea coast from the base at Aitape. During the last four days of July, \"Ammen\" participated in the unopposed landings at Cape Sansapor on the northwestern coast of the Vogelkop. After Sansapor, the warship embarked upon a voyage to Sydney, Australia, for an 18-day liberty and upkeep call.\n\nOn 26 August, \"Ammen\" headed back to the combat zone. Steaming by way of Milne Bay, New Guinea, she arrived in Seeadler Harbor, Manus, on 1 September. The destroyer spent the first 10 days of September engaged in drills and upkeep at Manus. On the 11th, she got underway for Morotai and another uncontested landing. The warship spent only two days at Morotai before returning to Seeadler Harbor via Mios Woendi.\n\n\"Ammen\" remained at Manus from 29 September until 11 October. On the latter day, she put to sea on a circuitous voyage bound ultimately for the invasion of the Philippines at Leyte. That circuit took her first to the northern coast of New Guinea where-at Humboldt Bay-she became a unit of the screen of the invasion force flagship . The flagship group weighed anchor on 15 October and laid in a course for Leyte Gulf. The destroyer escorted the command ship into Leyte Gulf in the predawn darkness of 20 October. The preparatory shore bombardment began about 0700 and lasted until just before 0945. At that point the landing craft began their approach to the beaches. Assigned to protect the force flagship, \"Ammen\" took no part in the festivities but watched dutifully for the intrusion of enemy aircraft and submarines. For the first five days of the Leyte undertaking, she continued to provide antiair and antisubmarine coverage to \"Wasatch\" and escorted her out to sea during her nightly retirements from San Pedro Bay.\n\nHer duties with respect to the flagship kept \"Ammen\" out of both the surface actions launched by the Japanese to contest the invasion of Leyte. By the time she was detached to join TG 77.3 on the afternoon of 25 October to guard the eastern entrance to Leyte Gulf, the Japanese had shot their bolt. The forces that had tried to charge through Surigao Strait to the south received a shattering welcome from the battleships, cruisers, and destroyers under Rear Admiral Jesse Oldendorf, and the force that had sneaked through San Bernardino Strait went about to retrace its path in face of the desperate resistance put up off Samar by the escort carriers and, particularly, by the destroyers and destroyer escorts screening them.\n\nThough the major Japanese effort to disrupt the Leyte landings had been foiled, it was not immediately apparent. As a consequence, \"Ammen\" served with several defensive formations on an ad hoc basis. As already stated, she joined TG 77.3 on the afternoon of 25 October to help guard the eastern entrance to Leyte Gulf. That assignment lasted until the early morning hours of the 27th when she transferred to TG 77.4, the escort carrier group that had been mauled off Samar on the 25th. Soon thereafter, she was assigned more specifically to Task Unit 77.4.2 (TU 77.4.2) built around and five other escort carriers. \"Ammen\" served with that outfit until the early morning hours of 29 October when she was reassigned to TG 77.2 inside Leyte Gulf. Later that day, the destroyer resumed duty screening the flagship as an element of TG 77.1.\n\nRebuffed on the surface, the Japanese resorted to an aerial blitz. \"Ammen\" spent the first 16 days of November helping to ward off enemy aircraft. On the very first day, 1 November, a burning Yokosuka P1Y \"Frances\" twin-engine bomber struck \"Ammen\" 15 feet from the bridge crew taking off a searchlight and two stacks. The plane caromed off the ship into the sea but caused considerable topside damage and inflicted 26 casualties, including five dead. \"Ammen\", however, carried on with her duties and claimed a number of hits and two probable kills in the aerial onslaught over the following two weeks. On 16 November, the warship laid in a course for the Admiralty Islands. She entered Seeadler Harbor on 21 November and spent the next nine days preparing for the voyage back to the United States. On 30 November, \"Ammen\" departed Manus and pointed her bow east toward the United States. After stops at Majuro and Pearl Harbor, she arrived in San Francisco on 21 December.\n\nRepairs to her battle damage carried out at the Mare Island Navy Yard kept \"Ammen\" out of the Lingayen Gulf operation in January 1945, and their completion at the beginning of the second week in February came too late for the destroyer to play a part in the mid-February seizure of Iwo Jima. On 9 February 1945, she sailed out of the Golden Gate in company with and set a course for Pearl Harbor. The two warships reached Oahu on 15 February, and \"Ammen\" performed training and carrier escort missions in the Hawaiian Islands until the middle of the first week in March. On 4 March, the destroyer departed Pearl Harbor in company with and her old division mate, . The three warships made one stop-at Eniwetok on the 10th for fuel-before arriving at Ulithi Atoll on 13 March. Leaving \"St. Louis\" at Ulithi, \"Ammen\" and \"Beale\" returned to sea on their way back to Leyte. \"Ammen\" and her colleague reached their destination on St. Patrick's Day 1945 and set about practicing for the invasion of the Ryukyu Islands.\n\nOn 27 March, she stood out of Leyte Gulf with TF 55, the Southern Attack Force, bound for the assault on Okinawa. The task force arrived off the assault beaches early in the morning of 1 April-Easter Sunday, April Fool's Day, and L-day for the invasion of Okinawa. \"Ammen\" took up screening station in the transport area while the troops in the transports made final preparations. The first wave rolled ashore just after 0830. \"Ammen\" spent the first 10 days of April providing antisubmarine and antiaircraft protection for the troop and cargo ships unloading at Okinawa. On the 10th, the destroyer joined TG 51.2 in a voyage to the Marianas, arriving back in the Ryukyus on the 20th.\n\nHer return to Okinawa on 20 April marked the beginning of \"Ammen\"s service on various of the radar picket stations established in the waters surrounding Okinawa to warn of approaching air raids and to help repulse them. Few tasks in World War II proved more arduous. It consisted of a grueling schedule of duty against fanatical and, more often than not, suicidal Japanese aviators. \"Ammen\" received her baptism in the Okinawa hail storm that night. After tracking her first bogey on radar picket duty just after midnight on the 21st, she failed to detect a second plane that flew in low and dropped a bomb fairly close aboard on her starboard quarter. The near miss exploded in the water, showering the warship with fragments. In that brief encounter, eight of her crew suffered wounds. \"Ammen\" remained on station until the evening of the 21st, when she was relieved by . The destroyer proceeded to the Hagushi beaches where she transferred the more serious of her casualties to before entering Kerama Retto for repairs and replenishment.\n\nFollowing patrol duty on the 26th and 27th, she took over support ship duties from on radar picket station number 1 north of Okinawa late in the morning of the 28th. That afternoon, an enemy raid-part of the fourth of the 10 major air assaults mounted by the Japanese in the effort to thwart the Okinawa invasion-approached \"Ammen\" and , the ship she was supporting on the radar picket station. A Nakajima Ki-43 \"Oscar\" dove on \"Ammen\" and \"Bennion\". Both destroyers opened fire on the intruder but failed to stop him. He crashed \"Bennion\"s fantail but caused only minor damage.\n\nWhile snoopers probed the area throughout the night, none approached nearer than three or four miles, and no new attacks developed until the following night. Just before 02:00 on 30 April, a group of between six and eight bogies appeared on \"Ammen\"s radar screen headed directly for her station. The destroyer opened fire about five minutes after the contacts were made. Smart ship handling caused the first two suiciders to overshoot \"Ammen\" and splash into the sea fairly close aboard to port. \"Bennion\" suffered additional minor damage when the third \"kamikaze\" struck another glancing blow to her fantail. \"Ammen\" received the attention of the fourth member of the group, but he, too, went into the sea. The two destroyers then combined forces to knock the fifth intruder out of the sky with antiaircraft fire. The sixth bandit went into the sea about three or four miles off to starboard. The final plane in the group fell before the guns of an American night fighter.\n\nRelative quiet returned to her station during the daylight hours of the 30th and the following night. Not long before noon on 1 May, \"Ammen\", relieved by , headed for Hagushi anchorage to receive on board a fighter director team along with its equipment. After refueling and replenishing at Kerama Retto, the destroyer headed for radar picket station 9 during the evening of 3 May. She remained on station until the 9th, directing combat air patrol (CAP) fighters put to meet sporadic raids of one, two, and three planes. Relieved by on the morning of 9 May, \"Ammen\" replenished at Kerama Retto that day and then moved on to Hagushi anchorage on the 10th. While at Hagushi, the destroyer opened fire briefly on the evening of 12 May at an \"Oscar\" and a Nakajima Ki-44 \"Tojo.\" Both planes attempted suicide dives on . The \"Oscar\" overshot the mark, but the \"Tojo\" struck \"New Mexico\" amidships.\n\nOn 13 May, \"Ammen\" returned to radar picket duty, relieving as fighter director on station 16 about 50 miles west northwest of the peninsula on Okinawa known as Zampa Misaki. Over the next six days, the destroyer directed her CAP fighters out to meet a number of raids, but she, herself, fought no engagements with enemy aircraft. On the 18th, \"Ammen\" stood down and headed back to Hagushi. On the 19th, she put into Kerama Retto for repairs alongside until the 22d. After two days back at Hagushi, the destroyer resumed duty with the radar pickets in the afternoon of 24 May.\n\nHer return coincided with the seventh of Japan's 10 \"kikusui\" attacks on Okinawa shipping. The onslaught had begun the previous evening but had subsided somewhat during the daylight hours of the 24th when \"Ammen\" resumed duty as a fighter director. Just before 2000, the Japanese renewed their attacks with increasing intensity. The first six raids she detected posed no real threat to \"Ammen\" and her colleagues at radar picket station 15. The seventh raid closed to within five miles of her station but kept its distance in face of antiaircraft fire from \"Ammen\"s consorts. From that time until about 0300 on the 25th, aircraft flew back and forth over station 15. The warships assigned there let fly with their antiaircraft batteries whenever enemy planes approached.\n\nThroughout the night of 24–25 May, no Japanese aviator made a really determined attack on radar picket station 15. In fact, \"Ammen\"s radar screen remained clear of bogies during the morning watch of 25 May. Half an hour into the forenoon watch, however, things began to warm up. She detected a group of enemy planes approaching from the north about 40 miles distant. The destroyer dispatched her CAP fighters to meet the enemy, and they bagged two Nakajima Ki-44 \"Tojo\" Army fighters and two Kawasaki Ki-61 \"Tony\" Army fighters. Unfortunately, a fifth plane-another \"Tojo\"-slipped through and, a little after 0900, began a suicide dive, apparently at \"Ammen\". The destroyer opened fire, but the \"kamikaze\" maintained his course and gathered speed. Instead of striking \"Ammen\", though, he passed along her length and did a wingover into crashing her after torpedo mount. Though battered, \"Stormes\" remained afloat and, after repairs, continued in active service for almost three decades.\n\nRelative peace returned to radar picket station 15 that night, and continued until early on 27 May when the Japanese launched their eighth \"kikusui\" attack-the last in which 100 or more planes were involved. Attacks on other stations began as early as the end of the morning watch. \"Ammen\" made no contact with the enemy until about 1730 when she detected an enemy formation approaching Okinawa from the north. No bogies closed her station until after 2000 hours; but, between 2030 and 0200, she and fought off eight coordinated air attacks and sustained no damage in the effort. By 0330, the radar screen showed the skies to be clear of bogies within an eight-mile radius of \"Ammen\". Forty minutes later, the destroyer headed via Hagushi anchorage to Kerama Retto to refuel and replenish.\n\n\"Ammen\" served on radar picket duty for another four weeks. During that time Japanese air activity began to diminish rapidly. The enemy made two more \"kikusui\" efforts, both mere shadows of the murderous affairs of April and May but still lethal nonetheless. Enemy planes still ventured within range of her guns and fell victim to them. Efficient American air power directed by radar picket destroyers such as \"Ammen\", however, generally caught them and knocked them out of the air at some distance from the ships around Okinawa. The warship completed her last tour of duty as a radar picket on 23 June. After taking on fuel at Kerama Retto the following morning, she put to sea in company with several other destroyers on their way to Leyte in the Philippines.\n\n\"Ammen\" arrived at Leyte on 27 June and began a fortnight of recreation and upkeep. On 13 July, she got underway from Leyte with TF 95, built around . Her task force arrived at Okinawa on 16 July but returned to sea that same day to conduct a surface anti-shipping sweep of the East China Sea. Following a detour to avoid a typhoon, \"Ammen\" and her colleagues began their sweep on 22 July. Unfortunately, they encountered no targets of any consequence and returned to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on the morning of 24 July. The destroyer participated in two more similarly futile anti-shipping sweeps of the East China Sea during the last days of July and the first week in August.\n\nFollowing the cessation of hostilities in mid-August, \"Ammen\" operated in the Ryukyu Islands until the end of the first week in September. On 7 September, she departed Okinawa on her way to Japan proper, arriving at Nagasaki on the 15th. Six days later, she moved to Sasebo. \"Ammen\" served in Japanese waters until 17 November when she embarked upon the voyage back to the United States. Steaming by way of Midway, Pearl Harbor, San Diego, and the Panama Canal, the warship arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, two days before Christmas 1945. After completing inactivation overhaul, \"Ammen\" was placed out of commission on 15 April 1946 and was berthed with the Charleston Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet.\n\nThe outbreak of war in Korea in the summer of 1950 and American support for South Korea in that conflict compelled the Navy to expand its active fleet. Preparations for \"Ammen\"s reactivation began late in 1950, and she was recommissioned at Charleston, South Carolina, on 5 April 1951, Comdr. Ralph P. Desmond in command. Though officially deemed to be active, the destroyer required three additional months of reconditioning before putting to sea. After refresher training out of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in July and August, \"Ammen\" returned to Charleston in September for a modernization overhaul that lasted until the spring of 1952. Following refresher training in the West Indies, the warship reported for duty with the Atlantic Fleet as an element of Destroyer Division 182 (DesDiv 182) based at Newport, Rhode Island\n\nOn 26 August 1952, \"Ammen\" stood out of Newport bound for her first tour of duty in European waters. She cruised in the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet until early 1953, participating in various training operations and showing the flag in ports on the European, North African, and Middle Eastern coasts of the Mediterranean. The destroyer returned to Newport in February 1953 and operated with the 2d Fleet until August. On 10 August 1953, she departed Boston for the Far East. The warship served with the 7th Fleet, frequently in waters adjacent to the Korean peninsula, through the end of the year. \"Ammen\" concluded her tour of duty in the Orient on 14 January 1954. Making the westward voyage by way of the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal, she arrived in Newport on 10 March. In April, the warship entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for regular overhaul. She completed repairs early that summer and then conducted refresher training in the West Indies in August and September.\n\nThat fall, Destroyer Squadron 18 (DesRon 18) was reassigned to the Pacific Fleet. Accordingly, on 30 November 1954, \"Ammen\" got underway from Newport in company with her squadron mates to make the transit to San Diego. Upon reporting to the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet, after navigating the Panama Canal, DesRon 18 became DesRon 21. In January 1955 the destroyer embarked upon another assignment with the 7th Fleet in the western Pacific. During that assignment, she supported the evacuation of Nationalist Chinese from the Tachen Islands then under pressure from communist forces on the nearby mainland. Before completing that deployment, \"Ammen\" also served on the Taiwan Strait patrol.\n\nAfter her return to San Diego on 19 June 1955, the warship took up normal 1st Fleet operations, conducting type training and participating in fleet exercises in the eastern Pacific. That employment occupied her through January 1956. On 7 February of that year, \"Ammen\" left San Diego again on her way to the Far East. That deployment lasted until late July when she headed back to the west coast of the United States. The destroyer reached San Diego on 11 August and, on the 30th, began a three-month overhaul at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard near San Francisco. She returned to San Diego and to active service on 7 December.\n\nOn 16 April 1957, \"Ammen\" stood out of San Diego bound for another tour of duty with the 7th Fleet in the Far East. En route, she took quite a detour, steaming via Suva in the Fiji Islands to Melbourne, Australia, to participate in the celebration of the 15th anniversary of the Allied victory in the Battle of the Coral Sea. After the commemoration, \"Ammen\" headed north via Manus in the Admiralty Islands and Guam to Yokosuka where she arrived on 1 June. A little less than four months later she concluded her assignment with the 7th Fleet and stood out of Yokosuka on 29 September to return to the United States.\n\n\"Ammen\" arrived back in San Diego on 14 October and, after post-deployment stand down, resumed normal 1st Fleet operations along the California coast. She remained so occupied until late June 1958. On the 25th, the destroyer got underway again for the western Pacific. She arrived in Yokosuka on 13 July to begin five months of duty with the 7th Fleet. In a deployment plagued by engineering casualties, \"Ammen\" still managed extended service at sea with the fast carriers of TF 77 and on the Taiwan Strait patrol. On 6 December, she departed Yokosuka to return to San Diego. \"Ammen\" steamed into San Diego on 18 December and remained there exactly 10 weeks completing the usual post-deployment and holiday leave and upkeep period and preparing for regular overhaul.\n\nAt the end of February 1959, the destroyer began her overhaul at San Francisco. Repairs complete, she resumed active duty late in June. In mid-August, \"Ammen\" departed San Diego for operations between Pearl Harbor and Guam. At the end of September, she returned briefly to the California coast at Long Beach. Early in October, the destroyer embarked upon the final western Pacific deployment of her career. She returned to the west coast from that tour of duty early in 1960. Later that spring the warship began preparations for inactivation.\n\nOn 19 July 1960, while making the transit between Seal Beach and San Diego for decommissioning, \"Ammen\" was struck by . The collision killed 11 \"Ammen\" sailors and injured 20 others. The USCGC \"Heather\" (WAGL / WLB-331) participated in the assistance effort. \"Ammen\" was initially towed into Long Beach and, later, from there to San Diego where she was decommissioned on 15 September 1960. \"Ammen\"s name was struck from the Navy List on 1 October 1960, and she was sold to the National Metal and Steel Corporation on 20 April 1961 for scrapping.\n\"Ammen\" earned eight battle stars during World War II.\n\n"}

{"id": "1827079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827079", "title": "Stone Fleet", "text": "Stone Fleet\n\nThe Stone Fleet consisted of a fleet of aging ships (mostly whaleships) purchased in New Bedford and other New England ports, loaded with stone, and sailed south during the American Civil War by the Union Navy for use as blockships. They were to be deliberately sunk at the entrance of Charleston Harbor, South Carolina in the hope of obstructing blockade runners, then supplying Confederate interests. Although some sank along the way and others were sunk near Tybee Island, Georgia, to serve as breakwaters, wharves for the landing of Union troops, the majority were divided into two lesser fleets. One fleet was sunk to block the south channel off Morris Island, and the other to block the north channel near Rattlesnake Shoals off the present day Isle of Palms in what proved to be failed efforts to block access the main shipping channels into Charleston Harbor.\n\nVarious old ships, specifically purchased by the Navy for this purpose, were loaded with stone and sand, or filled with dirt, then towed to a designated spot and sunk as a hazard to all craft that passed. Twenty-four whaleships were sunk in Charleston Harbor by Captain Charles Henry Davis, beginning on 19 December 1861. A second fleet of 12 to 20 vessels was sunk in nearby Mafitt's Channel in 1862. The operation was under the direction of Samuel Francis DuPont, Flag Officer commanding the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Confederate general Robert E.

He was Director of Campaigns & Elections for the Liberal Democrats from 1989 to 2003, and Chief Executive of the party from 2003 to 2009.\n\nRennard was born in 1960 the second of three sons to Cecil Rennard (1888-1963) and Jean Winfred Watson (1923-1976/77). He has an older step sister from his father's first marriage, his father also had two step children through that marriage.\n\nRennard was educated at the Liverpool Blue Coat School and gained a BA (Hons) Social Studies in 1982 from the University of Liverpool. From his early teens he was an active member of the Liberal Party. He began his political activism in Liverpool in the late 1970s, where he chaired the Liverpool University Liberals. He cites the early pioneers of community politics in Liverpool, including Cyril Carr, Trevor Jones and David Alton, as having had a major influence on him. Rennard was Deputy Chair of the Liverpool Liberal Party and organised many of the party's election campaigns in the 1980s, at a time when the Liberal Party controlled the City Council. The first successful parliamentary by-election campaign he worked on was the Liverpool Edge Hill by-election in March 1979, at which the party's candidate was David Alton. Rennard was Alton's agent when he successfully contested the newly created Liverpool Mossley Hill constituency in 1983 (after boundary changes) and helped to secure an excellent result there in a general election that saw a landslide Conservative victory nationally.\n\nIn 1984 he became one of the party's national Area Agents, based in Leicester, when the party won its first seats there for over 20 years. He was a member of many of the Liberal/Alliance by-election campaign teams, including those in West Derbyshire in 1986 and Greenwich in 1987. He was a member of the standing committee of ALC (Association of Liberal Councillors) and wrote some party publications on election campaigning and party organisation.\n\nIn 1989 Rennard was appointed as Director of Campaigns and Elections for the Liberal Democrats. He married Ann McTegart (whom he had met when they were both Liberal Party agents in Merseyside in the 1980s) and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1989 New Year Honours.\n\nIn the 1997 general election he oversaw the party's target-seat campaign, which resulted in the Liberal Democrats nearly doubling its number of MPs from 26 to 46. In 2001 and 2005, with Tim Razzall (Baron Razzall) as Campaign Chair and Charles Kennedy as Leader, he also directed the Liberal Democrats' general-election campaigns, which further increased the number of Lib Dem MPs respectively to 52 and 62, the largest total of Liberal or Liberal Democrat MPs since 1923.\n\nHe was the party's Chief Executive between 2003 and 2009. During his employment by the Liberal Democrats at a national level, he was credited with winning 13 parliamentary by-elections for the party (11 gains and 2 holds), out of a total of 74 by-elections held—a success rate of 17.5%. The Eastbourne by-election in 1990 was claimed by Rennard as rescuing the Liberal Democrats from their very weak position following the merger of the Liberal Party and the SDP, and saw a 16,923 Conservative majority become a Liberal Democrat majority of 4,550. The by-election followed a major row between Rennard and Paddy Ashdown over the party leader's initial opposition to the Liberal Democrats fighting the by-election. A by-election in Christchurch during July 1993 saw the Liberal Democrats gain the seat from the Conservatives by the largest swing (35%) against any British government since 1918.\n\nFormer party leader Charles Kennedy has described Rennard as \"a quite extraordinary figure in British politics\", while his predecessor Paddy Ashdown praised Rennard as \"a formidable and widely-respected practitioner of political campaigning across all parties\". Iain Dale said in an interview in \"Total Politics\" (June 2011) that Rennard \"is probably the most formidable and feared political campaigner of the last 20 years.\"\n\nConcerning the 2001 general election, Andrew Stunell, a friend of Rennard's, is reported as having said: \"Last time people didn't follow Chris [Rennard's] instructions and the difference between those who did and who didn't – like in the Isle of Wight [which the party lost] – was very clear. The message got through.\"\n\nRennard has claimed credit for pioneering the successful Liberal Democrat election strategy of claiming narrow majorities when in second or even third place and ruthlessly squeezing third-party votes in Tory–Lib Dem and Labour–Lib Dem marginals; although this technique has been in use by the Liberal Party's campaigns teams since at least October 1974, when Rennard was 14 years old.\n\nRennard served as the Liberal Democrats Chief Executive from 2003 to 2009, during which time he was in overall charge of the party's election campaigns and organisation. His campaigns team continued to build the party's successes through by-elections such as Brent East in 2003 and Leicester South in 2004. Following the Lib Dems' victory at Brent East in 2003, \"The Independent\" profiled Lord Rennard, saying calling him \"a Liberal democrat who knows how to win elections\" and saying that \"In recent years thoughtful Conservatives surveying their wretched political predicament sometimes wondered aloud where \"their\" Peter Mandelson was. As usual they were asking the wrong question. They should have been seeking \"their\" Chris Rennard. For while Rennard enjoys a rather lower profile than New Labour's sultan of spin, the Liberal Democrats' own election guru is a no less formidable operator. True, Rennard has not managed to take the Liberal Democrats to Downing Street with a landslide majority, but it is in large part to him that the party owes its revival, the latest evidence of which was its victory in Brent East.\" As Chief Executive, Rennard oversaw the party’s recovery from a series of crises in January 2006 when Charles Kennedy resigned as Leader, Mark Oaten resigned as the party’s Home Affairs spokesman and Simon Hughes was claimed to be gay by \"The Sun\" newspaper. This turbulent period came to an end in March when he oversaw victory in the 2006 Dunfermline and West Fife by-election, which brought the total of Liberal Democrats MPs to 63. He chaired the Liberal Democrat general election campaign for both Sir Menzies Campbell and Nick Clegg between summer 2006 and May 2009, when he stood down as Chief Executive of the Party.\n\nRennard announced that he would be standing down as chief executive of the Liberal Democrats in May 2009. He indicated that he had discussed standing down some time earlier with the party leader, Nick Clegg, and that this was for family and health reasons, saying that he had \"struggled to maintain good diabetic control with the rigours of a very demanding lifestyle\". Clegg subsequently conceded that sexual harassment allegations against Rennard from multiple women also contributed to Rennard's resignation, stating that \"He left on health grounds but of course the issues of his inappropriate behaviour were in the background.\"\n\nAfter relinquishing the full-time position, Rennard continued to contribute to some party election campaigns on a constituency-by-constituency basis. However, Lib Dem President and future Party Leader Tim Farron insisted that \"Under no circumstances\" would Rennard have a future campaigning role. Rennard was appointed to chair a Commission on the Big Society set up by the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (ACEVO) to articulate a civil society vision of what charities wanted to achieve through the Big Society agenda. He was formerly a trustee of the charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH).\n\nHe is a Patron of The Crescent, a centre in St Albans which provides help and support to those living with, or otherwise affected by, HIV.\n\nLord Rennard provides advice and support on campaign, communication, fundraising and management issues through the consultancy Rennard & McTegart Ltd. He is the Director of Communications for the British Healthcare Trades Association (BHTA) and writes a regular \"Westminster Watch\" column for their Bulletin.\n\nRennard was created a life peer on 21 July 1999 as Baron Rennard, of Wavertree in the County of Merseyside, and was introduced in the House of Lords on 27 July 1999. He is the treasurer of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Diabetes and a vice chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Smoking and Health.\n\nIn the House of Lords, Rennard has mostly spoken on political and constitutional reform issues. He led for the Liberal Democrats in debate on what became the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, that set the framework for rules such as those governing party finance. He spoke in favour of replacing large donor funding of parties, with limited state funding. He has campaigned against abuses of the postal vote system and helped to bring about some reforms to it. He has spoken out strongly for and voted for reform of the House of Lords at every possible stage. In the 2010–2015 Parliament he was responsible for changing proposals to move electoral registration to an entirely voluntary system that some say would have greatly favoured the Conservatives. He was also responsible in the House of Lords for the cross-party amendment that blocked the proposed review of parliamentary boundaries, thought by some to favour the Conservatives by up to 30 seats at the next general election. He also speaks in the Lords on other issues, including some associated with public health including diabetes and smoking.\n\nIn May 2009 Rennard was criticised for claiming a House of Lords member's allowance of £41,678, having designated a flat in Eastbourne as his main residence and his central London house as his second home. A subsequent complaint made by the Sunlight Centre for Open Politics was investigated by the Clerk of the Parliaments Michael Pownall, who did not uphold it, \"In view of the assurances by Lord Rennard about the change in his circumstances and the time he spends in Eastbourne, and in the absence of any definition of main address in the current guidance to the House of Lords’ Members Expenses Scheme\".\n\nIn February 2013, \"Channel 4 News\" ran a report on Lord Rennard, alleging a history of sexual harassment during his time as an official of the party. Channel 4 stated that the alleged victims decided to comment publicly since Rennard had begun to again play an 'active role in the Party'. He strongly denied the allegations.\n\nThe earliest claims go back to 2007 when two women met Paul Burstow, then the party's Chief Whip in the Commons, to raise the issue with him. In a February 2013 statement issued shortly after \"Channel 4 News\" had broken the story, Nick Clegg wrote that claims about the improper conduct of Lord Rennard had been brought to his attention in 2008, but Rennard had denied any wrongdoing when challenged. The \"indirect and non-specific concerns\" he had been told about meant that he could take no further action, but Danny Alexander, Clegg's chief of staff at the time, had warned Rennard that the alleged behaviour would be \"wholly unacceptable\". A subsequent independent report in June 2013 by Helena Morrissey into \"processes and culture within the Liberal Democrats\" said that the leadership should have held an inquiry into the allegations at that time (when Rennard was still a member of staff).\n\nThere was no such inquiry until that conducted by Alistair Webster QC, who concluded after examining over a hundred statements (including those made by the complainants as a result of interviews with specially trained police officers) that the evidence was insufficient to proceed to a disciplinary hearing. While staffing disciplinary matters would have required a civil standard of proof to be met, at that time Liberal Democrat regulations demanded a criminal standard of proof to uphold allegations against a Party member.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police carried out their own investigation after one of the complainants went to them on 27 February 2013. On 26 September 2013 the Metropolitan Police announced they had dropped the investigation, because they had found \"insufficient evidence\". They did not submit a file to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration.\n\nFollowing the police \"No Further Action\" decision, the Liberal Democrats resumed their own inquiry with Alistair Webster QC acting as \"independent investigator.\" According to a later public statement by Lord Rennard, there were three complaints by the deadline of 22 November 2013, and Alistair Webster reported that there was insufficient evidence to proceed further. A fourth complaint was then also considered and Alistair Webster again reported (on 22 December 2013) that there was insufficient evidence to proceed any further. The party rules required the independent QC to either recommend a disciplinary hearing to investigate further, or to say that there was insufficient evidence to proceed.\n\nAlistair Webster informed Lord Rennard on 15 January 2014 that the decision was \"No Further Action\", and that the party statement that day was \"not his responsibility.\" Webster's public statement on his conclusions from his report stated that there was \"broadly credible\" evidence of \"behaviour which violated the personal space and autonomy of the complainants.\" The question of the standard of proof required did not arise as the evidence was insufficient to hold a disciplinary hearing - except that Webster did consider this question, noting in his statement that \"my task was to review the evidence which I received and consider whether there was a greater than 50% chance that such a charge could be proved to the standard required by the rules, i.e. proof beyond reasonable doubt [a criminal, rather than civil standard of proof] ... My view, judging the evidence as a whole, is that there is a less than 50% chance that a charge against Lord Rennard could be proved to the requisite standard\". Webster concluded that it was \"unlikely that it could be established beyond reasonable doubt that Lord Rennard had intended to act in an indecent or sexually inappropriate way\" and that \"I have specifically discounted suggestions made during the investigation that the incidents had been invented as part of a political campaign against Lord Rennard. In my view Lord Rennard ought to reflect upon the effect that his behaviour has had and the distress which it caused and that an apology would be appropriate, as would a commitment to change his behaviour in future\".\n\nNeither Nick Clegg nor Tim Farron had read the Webster report (Webster stated 'I do not consider it appropriate to publish the evidence') and Lord Rennard was initially also denied sight of it, in spite of earlier promises that he would see it. Farron asked Lord Rennard to apologise to the women involved. It was reported in \"The Daily Telegraph\" that Clegg had stated that \"it is right that Chris Rennard has been asked in this report to apologise, to reflect on his behaviour.\" Clegg went on to state that Rennard would not be \"playing any role in my general election plans for the campaign in 2015.\"\n\nThe report was eventually provided to Lord Rennard and to the four complainants in March 2014 and it did not contain any request or recommendation for an apology - though Webster made this request in his Jan 2014 public statement on conclusions from his investigation. A statement from Lord Rennard in August 2014 said that a Liberal Democrat English Appeals Committee ruling in July 2014 found that \"I could not be criticised over my reaction to the previous report by Alistair Webster QC, as I was not given sight of the report for 11 weeks\".\n\nOn 20 January 2014, Rennard was suspended from the Liberal Democrats; he was informed that this was on the basis of \"Media and social media comments made by you, endorsed by you and made on your behalf that have attacked the party and the party processes publicly since the announcement of the Webster report results.\" Lord Rennard's friend and legal adviser, Lord Carlile, wrote a strongly critical article in \"The Mail on Sunday\" about \"the party's unjust and arbitrary conduct of the case\". The week following the suspension, \"The Times\" reported from 'allies' of Rennard that the peer knew \"where the bodies are buried\" and that were he expelled from the Liberal Democrats he would reveal two decades of sex scandal in the Party: \"We have had a Cuban missile crisis over the past week.\"\n\nLord Rennard issued a lengthy personal statement in response to his suspension explaining some of the background to the allegations made against him and the party's handling of them.\n\nThe seven-month suspension of his party membership was lifted in August 2014, when there was a \"No Further Action\" decision in relation to his criticisms of party processes and he was restored to full membership of the party. A later statement was issued by Rennard on 21 August 2014 saying that:\nHelena Morrissey was invited to report on processes and culture within the Liberal Democrats, and her report in December 2014 concluded, in relation to Lord Rennard, that:\n\nDuring his campaign to become Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron said that if elected he would have \"no intention of appointing him [Rennard] to any role in the party.\"\n\nIn November 2017, the Party's Deputy Leader (and future Leader), Jo Swinson, expressed her desire in a comment piece that Lord Rennard would not be a Liberal Democrat member, writing \"That Lord Rennard remains in the party, showing no remorse or contrition, while many of the women involved have left, fills me with sadness and anger ... I do not want Lord Rennard to continue as a member of the party. As far as I am concerned, he is not welcome.\"\n\nIn November 2015 Rennard was chosen to serve as the Liberal Democrat Lords' representative to the Liberal Democrats' governing Federal Executive Committee. A Special Conference triggered by Party members opposed to the decision was averted when Rennard agreed to resign his Committee membership following a public intervention by Tim Farron, who stated \"Chris serving on the FE is not in our best interest, as the levels of anger and division have shown. I am therefore asking Chris to step down from the FE in the best interests of the party\".\n\nThe first volume of his memoirs, \"Winning Here\", went on sale on 25 January 2018.\nThe launch was mired in controversy, when it turned out Lord Rennard was being investigated by the information commissioner for a breach of data protection law by sending unsolicited emails promoting the book to Lib Dem supporters. \"Private Eye\" reported that the email offered a 25% discount \"when you click through to the shopping page\". Readers who accepted would then be treated to how \"I started running council elections in my teens, was a successful constituent agent at 22, the Lib Dem director of campaigns and elections at 29, a peer at 39\". \"Private Eye\" titled the article \"Comeuppance Corner\", as Lord Rennard was one of those that voted for a change in the data protection law to make newspapers pay both sides' costs in data protection cases.\n\n"}

{"id": "1827086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827086", "title": "Clamshell Alliance", "text": "Clamshell Alliance\n\nThe Clamshell Alliance is an anti-nuclear organization co-founded by Paul Gunter, Howie Hawkins, Howard Morland, Harvey Wasserman, Guy Chichester, Robert \"Renny\" Cushing, Jeff Brummer, Anna Gyorgy, Kristie Conrad, Kate Walker, Robin Read, and other activists in 1976. \n\nThe Granite State Alliance, a NH social-change organization, had launched PEP, the People's Energy Project, several years earlier, in opposition to the proposed Seabrook nuclear power plant. PEP had opposed investment in the plant and had helped gather petitions and organize town meeting votes against its construction. The Clamshell Alliance's coalescence began in 1975 as New England activists and organizations began to respond to U.S. President Richard Nixon's \"Project Independence\" which sought to build 1000 nuclear power plants by 2000.\n\nThe group conducted non-violent demonstrations against nuclear power in New England in the late 1970s and 1980s. In May, 1977 over 2,000 Clamshell protesters occupied the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant construction site. 1,414 of these activists were arrested and held in jails and National Guard armories for up to two weeks after refusing bail.\n\nIn 2007, veterans of the Clamshell Alliance marked the 30th anniversary of its founding with the creation of a website called, \"To the Village Square: Nukes, Clams and Democracy\", which relates the story of the Clamshell Alliance and why it matters today. The Clamshell Alliance opposes all nuclear power in New England.\n\nIn July 1976 the Clamshell Alliance adopted a Declaration of Nuclear Resistance as a guiding set of principles in a meeting of 60-75 activists.\n\nThe alliance conducted non-violent demonstrations in the late 1970s and 1980s. On August 1, 1976, 18 New Hampshire residents were arrested for criminal trespass and disorderly conduct in Clamshell's first civil disobedience action on the Seabrook site. Three weeks later, a second occupation involved 180 New England residents who were arrested and held in a local armory overnight. In May, 1977 over 2,000 protesters occupied the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant construction site. 1,414 of these activists were arrested and held in jails and National Guard armories for up to two weeks after refusing bail. Clamshell activists used this detention for training and networking, and long considered the detention a blunder on the part of Republican Governor Meldrim Thomson, Jr.\n\nRichard Asinof wrote:\n\nIn later years, New Hampshire authorities minimized the impact of mass civil disobedience at the Seabrook plant by treating activist trespass as a violation, and allowing community service in lieu of fines. Actions were still media events capable of swaying public opinion, but their larger impact was limited. Clamshell Alliance members attempted to have their actions taken more seriously by the courts, and began staging sit-ins of the office of Republican Governor Judd Gregg. While this action resulted in jail time for criminal trespass, the local courts would not rule on the question of \"competing harms\" or the \"Right of Revolution\" granted by the New Hampshire Constitution. Activist Guy Chichester eventually sawed down a Seabrook Station emergency warning siren pole, resulting in charges of \"criminal mischief\", a Class B felony. Although there was no doubt that he had cut down the pole, Chichester was acquitted. In his appeal Chichester's lawyer Patrick Fleming argued that according to article 10 of the New Hampshire state constitution, any citizen has a right to act to protect his or herself when the state fails to do so, which is known as the \"Right of Revolution:\"\n[Art.] 10. [Right of Revolution.] Government being instituted for the common benefit, protection, and security, of the whole community, and not for the private interest or emolument of any one man, family, or class of men; therefore, whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought to reform the old, or establish a new government. The doctrine of nonresistance against arbitrary power, and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind.\nThe Clamshell Alliance was an inspiration to other communities who wished to organize opposition to nuclear power plants. Hundreds of groups with similar names, such as the Abalone Alliance in California, adopted similar non-violent organizing techniques to oppose nuclear power and nuclear weapons around the country and internationally.\n\nIn 1978 the Clamshell Alliance split after the Coordinating Committee (CC) agreed to call off a large disobedience planned at the power plant site in June. This was made as an \"Emergency Decision\" bypassing the normal consensus process obtaining input and consensus by regional Clam groups. The state government of New Hampshire feeling that a massive arrest on the site would overwhelm the state, undermine support and finance for the Seabrook nuclear project, and also result in the costs of hiring police from neighboring states, incarcerating thousands of Clams and paying court expenses offered to let Clamshell hold a solar power fair and concert on the site. This proposal was eventually accepted by Clamshell and a highly successful rally of 20,000 people was held on the site with thousands of Clams also camped out on the Seabrook site. But the political consequences within Clamshell led to a split in the Alliance and the eventual formation of the Coalition for Direct action at Seabrok (CDAS).\n\nThe Rath Proposal, made by NH attorney General Tom Rath, for a rally on the site was first vigorously debated within Clamshell. Clamshell eventually \"accepted\" the Rath proposal, through normal Alliance wide consensus process,with a list of conditions very unfavorable to continued Seabrook nuclear construction and operation that the State of NH and Public Service Company would not accept. But the Rath proposal helped exacerbate tensions within the Alliance among those calling for more radical action, those supporting more classic civil disobedience, and those who were beginning to question the usefulness of large CD actions in the Seacoast; as well as tensions between local Seacoast residents and supporters, who were providing land for thousands of Clams to camp and stage the occupation, and Clams living far away, many of whom scheduled vacations for a non-violent occupation and likely time in custody. The political tension within Clamshell, combined with pressure from authorities on locals, a media frenzy with anticipatory headlines such as \"Kent State at Seabrook?\", finally resulted in local landowners withdrawing their land as camping and staging sites near the Seabrook site. What is clear is that Seacoast landowners did not feel that the thousands of Clams expected to arrive on their land were thousands of supporters who would do what was needed to help protect them from harm. Clamshell had allowed a gap to grow between the local supporters and the Alliance as a whole that was exploited by the State and the Seabrook builders.\n\nThe Emergency Decision was undertaken to accept the Rath proposal and hold a legal rally on site and at the same time to hold a mass non-violent civil disobedience at NRC headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C. The original intent was for a \"Clamtrack\"journey by train of thousands of Clams to blockade the NRC that would license the Seabrook plant. It seemed like an excellent tactical pivot at the time by those making the decision. Seabrook construction had been halted before by an NRC Board meeting in Manchester NH in a building surrounded by perhaps two thousand Clams ringing the building. Thousands of Clams showing up in Washington for a nonviolent action at the NRC would certainly shake things up. Clam organizer Chuck Matthai in discussions of what to do after the landowners withdrew land advised Clams to reshape our imagination in response to changed circumstances. This led to what key organizers and the CC felt was a good path forward. Unfortunately, the Emergency Decision was widely considered a violation of the spirit of the consensus process that had governed Clam decision making. The Rally at Seabrook took place, but the civil disobedience action at the NRC was spirited, but small.\n\nBy the spring of 1978, in preparation for the June 24 action, over 5,000 clams had been trained in non-violence by Clamshell non-violence trainers, and organized into affinity groups of roughly 5 to 20 people, with the affinity groups organized into regional cluster groups of roughly 200 to 500 members. Each affinity group met to decide issues by consensus, and the clusters operated typically by an affinity groups spokes council. The highly anticipated action, scheduled to begin June 24, 1978, would have been by-far the largest civil disobedience action of its kind.\n\nMany Clamshell members felt that the agreement which was made as an \"emergency decision\" was a betrayal of the democratic consensus process that was an integral part of Clamshell's organization just at the time when the state and the Public Service Company of New Hampshire appeared at their most vulnerable. The Emergency Decision mechanism had been adopted in spring of 1978 after NH State Police were discovered by Robin Read and Cathy Wolff looking out the window at a van parked across the street from the Clamshell office at 92 Congress St. in Portsmouth photographing members attending a New England wide Coordinating Committee meeting. It was reasonably feared that the state would undertake preemptive arrests of the CC (Coordinating Committee) members to disrupt the action.\n\nThe Emergency Decision mechanism to allow decisions without the normal consensus process of sending CC proposals back to Clamshell regions and their affinity to obtain consensus and was suggested by Roy Morrison of the ORTF (Occupation/Restoration Task Force) that was planning the June 1978 action. All plans of the ORTF were submitted to the CC and the normal consensus process. The intent of the Emergency Decision making mechanism was to allow, in cases of mass arrests of CC member or other similar disruptive state action, to allow the CC or a reconstituted CC, to make emergency decisions by consensus without sending the proposal back to regional groups for the normal and necessarily slow back and forth consensus process. This Emergency Decision making mechanism was adopted after concerns were raise that it was a means to allow the action to become more radical, and to adopt measures such as fence cutting to gain access to the Seabrook site.No one suggested it was potentially a tool to abandon an action.\n\nThe dissidents within Clam broke off to form another organization to be called the Coalition for Direct Action at Seabrook (CDAS) which would take more militant but still nonviolent action on the site. \n\nComposed of several \"clusters\" throughout New England and metropolitan New York that were themselves composed of smaller \"affinity groups\", CDAS decided using the consensus process, to attempt to occupy the power plant site. The first attempted occupation was planned for October, 1979 and activists agreed that they would be willing to tear down fencing protecting the site but avoid fighting with police when confronted and also try to avoid arrest. The new strategy was controversial and many former Clamshell members decided to not get involved once the more confrontational tactics were decided on. Many of the demonstrators would equip themselves with helmets and gas masks in anticipation of police violence against them and the critics argued that this would be too provocative. \n\nNevertheless, the attempted occupation drew over 3,500 activists who felt energized after growing disillusionment with nuclear power with the near meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania a few months earlier. The activists made several attempts to get through fencing and at one point entered the site but were met by state police equipped with pepper spray, tear gas, and in one case, a fire hose spraying water on them. Dozens of arrests were made. The occupation was not successful in taking over the site but drew much national media attention. \n\nCDAS, regrouping over the following winter, again attempted an occupation on the site in April, 1980. This time, a smaller group of activists, about 2,000 met police at the fences but were also repulsed by the police. \n\nThe following year several hundred Clams attempted to block the delivery of the first reactor containment vessel to the site but police kept the roads clear. This was the last large New England Clamshell Action. The Coalition dissolved not long afterward after stirring a lot of debate in the anti-nuclear movement about what could be considered appropriate tactics in a non-violent movement.\n\nIn the 1980s numerous civil disobedience actions were organized by NH based Clams with a Concord Clam office headquarters. Several thousands were arrested at the Seabrook site. One of the largest actions took place on the day of the Tiananmen Square massacre, on June 4 , 1989. Over 1000 clams were arrested after climbing the fence opposing Seabrook plant licensing and operation. Clamshell carpenters had built hinged ladders which allowed Clams to quickly climb over the fence without cutting fences, and kept the enforcers on the inside of the fence and unable to come out and attack demonstrators. Numerous actions took place at the NH State house with sitins at the Governor's office to oppose Seabrook licensing.\n\nPublic Service Company of New Hampshire, the utility with majority ownership of the Seabrook Station, was bankrupted by the project. Governor Hugh J. Gallen had signed legislation prohibiting the utility from billing consumers for the costs of construction work in progress (CWIP), and the Three Mile Island accident had increased awareness and added the requirement for an evacuation plan prior to commissioning. In the end, only one of the two planned reactors went on line.\n\nIn 2007, veterans of the Clamshell Alliance marked the 30th anniversary of its founding with the creation of a website called, \"To the Village Square: Nukes, Clams and Democracy\", which relates the story of the Clamshell Alliance and why it matters today. In addition, a book and a travelling exhibit are planned.\n\n\n"}

The group's activities primarily targeted infrastructure carrying water to the English city of Liverpool.\n\nMAC was initially set up in response to the flooding of the Afon Tryweryn valley and the flooding of the village of Capel Celyn to provide water for Liverpool. Its founders were Owain Williams, John Albert Jones and Emyr Llewelyn Jones. On 10 February 1963 a transformer at the dam construction site was blown up by three men, of whom one, Emyr Llywelyn Jones, was identified, convicted and sentenced to one year imprisonment. MAC blew up an electricity pylon at Gellilydan on the day of his conviction. This led to the arrest and conviction of Owain Williams and John Albert Jones.\n\nThe leadership of the organisation was later taken over by John Barnard Jenkins, a former non-commissioned officer in the British Army's Royal Army Medical Corps. Under his leadership, MAC was suspected by British police to have been behind the bombing of the Clywedog dam construction site in 1966. In 1967 a pipe carrying water from Lake Vyrnwy to Liverpool was blown up. Later the same year MAC exploded a bomb at the Temple of Peace and Health in Cardiff's civic centre, close to a venue which was to be used for a conference to discuss the Investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales. In 1968 a tax office in Cardiff was blown up, followed the same year by the Welsh Office building in the same city, then another water pipe at Helsby, Cheshire. In April 1969 a tax office in Chester was the next target. On 30 June 1969, the evening before the investiture, two members of MAC, Alwyn Jones and George Taylor, were killed when a bomb they had been placing near government offices exploded prematurely. On the day of the investiture, two other bombs were planted in Caernarfon, one in the local police constable's garden which exploded as the 21 gun salute was fired. Another was planted in an iron forge near the castle but failed to go off. The final bomb was placed on Llandudno Pier and was designed to stop the Royal Yacht Britannia from docking - this too failed to explode. In November 1969 John Jenkins was arrested, and in April 1970 was convicted of eight offences involving explosives and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. In an interview shown on the BBC2 4 July 2009, John Jenkins repeated his intention that the bombs were never planted or timed to hurt people but just to disrupt the ceremony. Although there were further bombings, there is no evidence that MAC were involved.\n\n\n"}

Most of the submarines completed by Lake Torpedo Boat were completed from 1918 to 1922.\n\nThe firm competed with the Electric Boat Company until financial difficulties led to the company's demise in 1924. The Navy ceased awarding contracts to Lake shortly before that time, partly because , the company's entry in the S-class submarine design competition, was not selected for further production. Only nine S-boats were built by Lake. Also, the yard was not physically able to build the large submarine cruisers then envisioned, such as . The Washington Naval Treaty's limits on submarines were also a major factor. At the time, the Navy wished to concentrate submarine construction at Navy Yards, particularly Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine.\n\nThe company completed 26 submarines for the US Navy, designed two US Navy submarines that were built in other yards, and built several other submarines for civilian use or that were not accepted by the Navy.

When he was three, the household moved to Crocketford in Kirkcudbrightshire. He attended the local school where the teacher found him to be of average ability. The area around Crocketford was renowned for martyrdom and Anderson seems to have taken inspiration from his walks in the hills in his later poetry. At 16 he was back in his native village working in a quarry; some two years later (1862), he became a surfaceman or platelayer on the Glasgow and South-western railway, and generally wrote under the name of Surfaceman.\n\nSpending all his leisure in self-culture, he mastered German, French, and Spanish sufficiently to read the chief masterpieces in these languages. His poetic vein, which was true if somewhat limited in range, soon manifested itself, and in 1870 he began to send verses to the ‘People's Friend’ of Dundee, and subsequently his first book ‘A Song of Labour and other Poems’, was published in 1873 by the \"Dundee Advertiser\" in a run of 1000. Thanks to the support of \"The People's Friend\" this issue sold out within a fortnight. He was also aided by the support of the Rev George Gilfillan, a poetry critic in Dundee. Gilfillan wrote to Thomas Aird \"You will be greatly interested in his simple manner and appearance-an unspoiled Burns is these respects and not without a little real . Of course you know his poetry and his remarkable history\". and there followed \"Two Angels\" (1875), \"Songs of the Rail\" (1878), and \"Ballads and Sonnets\" (1879). In the following year he was made assistant librarian in the University of Edinburgh, and after an interval as secretary to the Philosophical Institution there, he returned as Chief Librarian to the University. Thereafter he wrote little. Of a simple and gentle character, he made many friends, including the Duke of Argyll, Thomas Carlyle, and Lord Houghton.\n\nA famous poem of his is \"Cuddle Doon\".\n\n\n\n"}

The song was first performed on television in 1970, and released as a successful recording, topping the UK Singles Chart in 1971, reaching the Christmas number one spot.\n\nThe lyric's story line is inspired by Hill's early experience as a milkman for Hann's Dairies in Eastleigh, Hampshire. Market Street, mentioned in the lyrics, is a real-life street in Eastleigh. The song tells the fictional exploits of Ernie Price, a 52-year-old (68, in the original television version) milkman who drives a horse–drawn milk cart. It relates his feud with the bread delivery man (\"Two-Ton Ted\" from Teddington) and their efforts to win the heart of Sue, a widow who lives alone at No. 22, Linley Lane.\n\nWhen Ted sees Ernie's cart outside Sue's house all afternoon, he becomes enraged and violently kicks Price's horse, Trigger. The two men resort to a duel, using the wares they carry on their respective carts for weapons, and Ernie is killed by a rock cake underneath his heart, followed by a stale pork pie in his eye; in the original television version it was a fresh meat pie.\n\nSue and Ted then marry, but Ernie's ghost returns to haunt them on their wedding night.\n\n\"Ernie\" was originally written in 1955 as the introduction to an unfilmed screenplay about Hill's milkman experiences.\n\nIn 1966, Frank Gallop had a US hit with \"The Ballad of Irving\", which had a similar metre. \"The Ballad of Irving\" was itself inspired by Lorne Green's song \"Ringo\" from 1964, which had the same style and structure.\n\nHill performed the song on \"The Benny Hill Show\" in 1970. The original clip is seldom repeated as it was made in black and white owing to a technicians' strike, but the episode has been released on DVD, in both the United Kingdom and United States.\n\nIn the original television broadcast version, as part of the song's comedy plot, Benny incorrectly sings the name \"Ernie\" several times as: \"Hernie\", to which the backing singers would correct him, by strongly replying the name as: \"Ernie!\". To this, Benny would then pull an embarrassed/annoyed face. This comedy plot was concluded at the end of the song when Benny, pulling a mischievous face, sang a final: \"Hernie!\". On the record release, only the final: \"Hernie!\" is heard.\n\nThe following year, it was included with minor lyrical revisions on Hill's album \"Words and Music\". When it was released as a single on EMI's Columbia label, it became a surprise number-one hit, topping the UK Singles Chart for four weeks at Christmas 1971. A promotional film was shot starring Hill as Ernie, Henry McGee as Ted, and Jan Butlin as Sue.\n\nHill re-recorded the song shortly before his death in 1992 for the album \"Benny Hill... The Best Of\".\n\nOn \"Desert Island Discs\" in May 2006, Conservative Party leader, later Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron picked it as one of his eight favourite records.\n\nErnie was referenced in the Superhero segment of one episode of BBC TV's \"Basil's Swap Shop\", with an Ernie lookalike appearing at the superhero's flat, only to be told that speedy delivery of milk was not a super-power.\n\nThe single's B-side, \"Ting-A-Ling-A-Loo\", is a music hall parody.\n\n\n"}

It was originally released on September 17, 1991 on Carey's second studio album, \"Emotions\". Lyrically, the song tells of a romance that has withered, and finds the protagonist asking her lover \"if it's over, let me go.\" Several months after the release of \"Emotions\", Carey performed the song during her appearance on the television show \"MTV Unplugged\".\n\nFollowing the release of the \"MTV Unplugged\" EP, the song's live version was used as the second single released from the EP in late 1992. The live single version omits the second verse and chorus, as the songs were shortened for the show. It received a very limited release, being featured as an airplay only single in certain territories. Its only peak was in the Netherlands, where it reached number eighty. Carey performed \"If It's Over\" live during the 34th annual Grammy Awards and on \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\nDuring promotion for Carey's self-titled debut album (1990), she appeared on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" to perform her first single, \"Vision of Love\". During the very much talked about performance, singer-songwriter Carole King had been watching Carey perform, taking interest in her and her material. One year later, during the recording sessions for Carey's second studio album, \"Emotions\" (1991), King contacted Carey, asking if she would be interested in covering \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\", a song she had written alongside Gerry Goffin for Aretha Franklin. Carey declined, feeling uneasy about covering a song one of her musical influences executed so perfectly. Still determined to work with Carey, King flew out to New York City for one day, in hopes of writing and composing a ballad of some sort. Throughout the day, the two songwriters exchanged musical ideas and melodies on the piano until \"If It's Over\" came into conception. In an interview following the collaboration, King said the following regarding Carey: \"I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings.\"\n\n\"If It's Over\" is a downtempo ballad, which incorporates several genres and influences into its sound and instrumentation. Of them are R&B, soul and jazz, as well as drawing inspiration from 1950s and 1960s music and style. The song was written by Carey and Carole King, with both helming the song's production as well. Instrumentally, \"If It's Over\" features several musical melodies including baritone, tenor, alto and soprano saxophone notes, as well as the piano, trumpet, horn and bass. In the song, Carey makes brief use of the whistle register, prior to the last belted crescendo. According to author Chris Nickson, the song's instrumentation and basis was crucial to Carey's performance throughout the song. Additionally, he described its content and instrumentation:\n\n\"As a song full of gospel and soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show what she could do – which in reality was far more than the vocal gymnastics that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.\"\nCarey performed \"If It's Over\" on the 17th season of \"Saturday Night Live\", alongside \"Can't Let Go\". During the performance, Carey appeared on stage wearing a black leather sports jacket, as well as matching black pants and boots. Walter Afanasieff played the piano, while Trey Lorenz, Patrique McMillan and Melonie Daniels provided the live background vocals. Additionally, five additional musicians were provided; Lew Delgado, baritone saxophone; Lenny Pickett, tenor saxophone; George Young, alto saxophone; Earl Gardner, trumpet; and Steve Turre, trombone. Additionally, Carey performed \"If It's Over\" at the 34th annual Grammy Awards, held on February 26, 1992. As the curtain was drawn, Carey walked on stage wearing a red and black evening gown, while sporting a golden-curly hairstyle. Behind a large red curtain held behind her, several back up singers were placed standing on a concealed elevated platform. On March 16, 1992, Carey performed the song live as part of a seven piece set-list for \"MTV Unplugged\". The show aired on MTV several times, and was eventually released as an EP titled, \"MTV Unplugged\".\n\nFollowing the release of \"I'll Be There\" as the lead single from \"MTV Unplugged\" a month prior to the EP's public arrival, Carey's live version of \"If It's Over\" from \"MTV Unplugged\" was released as an airplay-only single in a few countries. It was released on CD and cassette as a commercial single in Australia on November 23, 1992. Following its release, promotion for Carey's second studio effort \"Emotions\" was halted.\n\nUpon release, \"If It's Over\" garnered generally positive critical appreciation from contemporary music critics. Bill Lamb from About.com commented that the song \"stands with Carey's best,\" and complimented its gospel infusion. Allmusic's Ashley S. Battel wrote \"it will take you on a musical journey,\" while describing the song's vocals and instrumentation. Jan DeKnock from \"The Chicago Tribune\" compared it to \"the style of the great soul ballads of the `60s.\" Rob Tannenbaum from \"Rolling Stone\" gave \"If It's Over\" a mixed review, comparing it to the work of Aretha Franklin, but called it \"translates into such excesses as the falsetto whoops.\" \"If It's Over\" only managed to chart at number 80 in the Netherlands, lasting five weeks in the chart.\n\nNetherlands/European CD single\n\nEuropean CD maxi-single\nJapanese CD single\n\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Emotions\".\n"}
{"id": "1827146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827146", "title": "End-group", "text": "End-group\n\nEnd groups are an important aspect of polymer synthesis and characterization. In polymer chemistry, end groups are functionalities or constitutional units that are at the extremity of a macromolecule or oligomer (IUPAC). In polymer synthesis, like condensation polymerization and free-radical types of polymerization, end-groups are commonly used and can be analyzed for example by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to determine the average length of the polymer. Other methods for characterization of polymers where end-groups are used are mass spectrometry and vibrational spectrometry, like infrared and Raman spectrometry. Not only are these groups important for the analysis of the polymer, but they are also useful for grafting to and from a polymer chain to create a new copolymer. One example of an end group is in the polymer poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate where the end-groups are circled.\n\nEnd groups are seen on all polymers and the functionality of those end groups can be important in determining the application of polymers. Each type of polymerization (free radical, condensation or etc.) have end groups that are typical for the polymerization, and knowledge of these can help to identify the type of polymerization method used to form the polymer.\n\nStep-growth polymerization involves two monomers with bi- or multifunctionality to form polymer chains. Many polymers are synthesized via step-growth polymerization and include polyesters, polyamides, and polyurethanes. A sub class of step-growth polymerization is condensation polymerization.\n\nCondensation polymerization is an important class of step-growth polymerization, which is formed simply by the reaction of two monomers and results in the release of a water molecule. Since these polymers are typically made up of two or more monomers, the resulting end groups are from the monomer functionality. Examples of condensation polymers can be seen with polyamides, polyacetals and polyesters. An example of polyester is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is made from the monomers terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. If one of the components in the polymerization is in excess, then that polymers functionality will be at the ends of the polymers (a carboxylic acid or alcohol group respectively). \nThe end groups that are found on polymers formed through free radical polymerization are a result from the initiators and termination method used. There are many types of initiators used in modern free radical polymerizations, and below are examples of some well-known ones. For example, azobisisobutyronitrile or AIBN forms radicals that can be used as the end groups for new starting polymer chains with styrene to form polystyrene. Once the polymer chain has formed and the reaction is terminated, the end group opposite from the initiator is a result of the terminating agent or the chain transfer agent used.\n\nGraft copolymers are generated by attaching chains of one monomer to the main chain of another polymer; a branched block copolymer is formed. Furthermore, end groups play an important role in the process of initiation, propagation and termination of graft polymers. Graft polymers can be achieved by either “grafting from” or “grafting to”; these different methods are able to produce a vast array of different polymer structures, which can be tailored to the application in question. The “grafting from” approach involves, for example, generation of radicals along a polymer chain, which can then be reacted with monomers to grow a new polymer from the backbone of another. In “grafting from” the initiation sites on the backbone of the first polymer can be part of the backbone structure originally or generated in situ. The “grafting to” approach involves the reaction of functionalized monomers to a polymer backbone. In graft polymers, end groups play an important role, for example, in the “grafting to” technique the generation of the reactive functionalized monomers occurs at the end group, which is then tethered to the polymer chain. There are various methods to synthesize graft polymers some of the more common include redox reaction to produce free radicals, by free radical polymerization techniques avoiding chain termination (ATRP, RAFT, Nitroxide mediated, for example) and step-growth polymerization. A schematic of “grafting from” and “grafting to” is illustrated in the figure below. \n\nThe \"grafting from\" technique involves the generation of radicals along the polymer backbone from an abstraction of a halogen, from either the backbone or a functional group along the backbone. Monomers are reacted with the radicals along the backbone and subsequently generate polymers which are grafted from the backbone of the first polymer. The schematic for \"grafting to\" shows an example using anionic polymerizations, the polymer containing the carbonyl functionalities gets attacked by the activated polymer chain and generates a polymer attached to the associated carbon along with an alcohol group, in this example. These examples show us the potential of fine tuning end groups of polymer chains to target certain copolymer structures.\n\nBecause of the importance of end groups, there have been many analytical techniques developed for the identification of the groups. The three main methods for analyzing the identity of the end group are by NMR, mass spectrometry (MS) or vibrational spectroscopy (IR or Raman). Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages, which are details below.\n\nThe advantage of NMR for end groups is that it allows for not only the identification of the end group units, but also allows for the quantification of the number-average length of the polymer. End-group analysis with NMR requires that the polymer be soluble in organic or aqueous solvents. Additionally, the signal on the end-group must be visible as a distinct spectral frequency, i.e. it must not overlap with other signals. As molecular weight increases, the width of the spectral peaks also increase. As a result of this, methods which rely on resolution of the end-group signal are mostly used for polymers of low molecular weight (roughly less than 20,000 g/mol number-average Molecular weight). By using the information obtained from the integration of a 1H NMR spectrum, the degree of polymerization (Xn) can be calculated. With knowledge of the identity of the end groups/repeat unit and the number of protons contained on each, the Xn can then be calculated. For this example above, once the 1H NMR has been integrated and the values have been normalized to 1, the degree of polymerization is calculated by simply dividing the normalized value for the repeat unit by the number of protons continued in the repeat unit. For this case, Xn = n = 100/2, and therefore Xn = 50, or there are 50 repeat units in this monomer.\nMass Spectrometry is helpful for the determination of the molecular weight of the polymer, structure of the polymer etc. Although chemists utilize many kinds of MS, the two that are used most typically are matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS). One of the biggest disadvantages of this technique is that much like NMR spectroscopy the polymers have to be soluble in some organic solvent. An advantage of using MALDI is that it provides the simpler data to interpret for end group identification compared ESI, but a disadvantage is that the ionization can be rather hard and as a result some end groups do not remain intact for analysis. Because of the harsh ionization in MALDI, one of the biggest advantages of using ESI is for its ‘softer’ ionization methods. The disadvantages of using ESI is that the data obtained an be very complex due to the mechanism of the ionization and thus can be difficult to interpret.\n\nThe vibrational spectroscopy methods used to analyze the end groups of a polymer are Infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy. These methods are useful in fact that the polymers do not need to be soluble in a solvent and spectra can be obtained simply from solid material. A disadvantage of the technique is that only qualitative data is typically obtained on the identification end groups.\n\nControlled radical polymerization, namely reversible addition−fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT), is a common method for the polymerization of acrylates, methacrylates and acrylamides. Usually, a thiocarbonate is used in combination with an effective initiator for RAFT. The thiocarbonate moiety can be functionalized at the R-group for end group analysis. The end group is a result of the propagation of chain-transfer agents during the free-radical polymerization process. The end groups can subsequently be modified by the reaction of the thiocarbonylthio compounds with nucleophiles and ionic reducing agents. \n\nThe method for removal of thiocarbonyl containing end groups includes reacting the polymers containing the end-groups with en excess of radicals which add to the reactive C=S bond of the end group forming an intermediate radical (shown below). The remaining radical on the polymer chain can be hydrogenated by what is referred to as a trapping group and terminate; this results in a polymer that is free of the end groups at the α and ω positions. \n\nAnother method of end group removal for the thiocarbonyl containing end-groups of RAFT polymers is the addition of heat to the polymer; this is referred to as thermolysis. One method of monitoring thermolysis of RAFT polymers is by thermogravietric analysis resulting in a weight-loss of the end group. An advantage of this technique is that no additional chemicals are required to remove the end group; however, it is required that the polymer be thermally stable to high temperature and therefore may not be effective for some polymers. Depending on the polymers sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation (UV) it has been reported in recent years that decomposition of end-groups can be effective, but preliminary data suggest that decomposition by UV leads to a change in the distribution of molecular weights of the polymer.\n\nSurface modification has gained a lot of interest in recent years for a variety of applications. An example of the application of free radical polymerizations to forming new architectures is through RAFT polymerizations which result in dithioester end groups. These dithioesters can be reduced to the thiol which can be immobilized on a metal surface; this is important for applications in electronics, sensing and catalysis. The schematic below demonstrates the immobilization of copolymers onto a gold surface as reported for poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) by the McCormick group at the University of Southern Mississippi.\n"}

However, he won once, for his work on the Alfred Hitchcock film \"Rebecca\" (1940). \"Barnes’ photographic interpretation of Rebecca is the sort of thing to which his fellow cinematographers may point, as indeed they did in bestowing upon it the industry's premiere Award, as a complete example of what truly great camerawork can mean to a production\".\n\nHe was married to Joan Blondell from 1933 to 1936 and filmed five of Blondell's Warner Bros. pictures. In fact, they met on \"The Greeks Had a Word for Them\" set in which she had the leading role. Their relationship is often said to have been intense. In an interview, Blondell explained that Barnes cured her from lying.

{"id": "1827174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827174", "title": "Alexander Gardner (photographer)", "text": "Alexander Gardner (photographer)\n\nAlexander Gardner (October 17, 1821 – December 10, 1882) was a Scottish photographer who immigrated to the United States in 1856, where he began to work full-time in that profession. He is best known for his photographs of the American Civil War, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, and the execution of the conspirators to Lincoln's assassination.\n\nAlexander was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, on 17 October 1821. He became an apprentice jeweller at the age of 14, lasting seven years. Gardner had a Church of Scotland upbringing and was influenced by the work of Robert Owen, Welsh socialist and father of the cooperative movement. By adulthood he desired to create a cooperative in the United States that would incorporate socialist values. In 1850, Gardner and others purchased land near Monona, Iowa, for this purpose, but Gardner never lived there, choosing to return to Scotland to raise more money. He stayed there until 1856, becoming owner and editor of the \"Glasgow Sentinel\" in 1851. Visiting The Great Exhibition in 1851 in Hyde Park, London, he saw the photography of American Mathew Brady, and thus began his interest in the subject.\n\nIn 1856, Alex and his family immigrated to the United States. Finding that many friends and family members at the cooperative he had helped to form were dead or dying of tuberculosis, he stayed in New York. He initiated contact with Brady and came to work for him that year, continuing until 1862. At first, Gardner specialized in making large photographic prints, called Imperial photographs, but as Brady’s eyesight began to fail, Gardner took on increasing responsibilities. In 1858, Brady put him in charge of his Washington, D.C. gallery.\n\nAbraham Lincoln became the American President in the November 1860 election and along with his election came the threat of war. Gardner, being in Washington, was well-positioned for these events, and his popularity rose as a portrait photographer, capturing the visages of soldiers leaving for war.\n\nBrady had the idea to photograph the Civil War. Gardner's relationship with Allan Pinkerton (who was head of an intelligence operation that would become the Secret Service) was the key to communicating Brady's ideas to Lincoln. Pinkerton recommended Gardner for the position of chief photographer under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Topographical Engineers. Following that short appointment, Gardner became a staff photographer under General George B. McClellan, commander of the Army of the Potomac. At this point, Gardner's management of Brady's gallery ended. The honorary rank of captain was bestowed upon Gardner, and he photographed the Battle of Antietam in September 1862, developing photos in his travelling darkroom.\n\nGardner has often had his work misattributed to Brady, and despite his considerable output, historians have tended to give Gardner less than full recognition for his documentation of the Civil War. Lincoln dismissed McClellan from command of the Army of the Potomac in November 1862, and Gardner’s role as chief army photographer diminished. About this time, Gardner ended his working relationship with Brady, probably in part because of Brady's practice of attributing his employees' work as \"Photographed by Brady\". That winter, Gardner followed General Ambrose Burnside, photographing the Battle of Fredericksburg. Next, he followed General Joseph Hooker. In May 1863, Gardner and his brother James opened their own studio in Washington, D.C, hiring many of Brady's former staff. Gardner photographed the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1863) and the Siege of Petersburg (June 1864–April 1865) during this time.\n\nIn 1866, Gardner published a two-volume work, \"Gardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the Civil War\". Each volume contained 50 hand-mounted original prints. The book did not sell well. Not all photographs were Gardner's; he credited the negative producer and the positive print printer. As the employer, Gardner owned the work produced, as with any modern-day studio. The sketchbook contained work by Timothy H. O'Sullivan, James F. Gibson, John Reekie, William Pywell, James Gardner (his brother), John Wood, George N. Barnard, David Knox and David Woodbury, among others. Among his photographs of Abraham Lincoln were some considered to be the last taken of the President, four days before his assassination, although later this claim was found to be incorrect, while the pictures were actually taken in February 1865, the last one being on the 5th of February. Gardner would photograph Lincoln on a total of seven occasions while Lincoln was alive. He also documented Lincoln's funeral, and photographed the conspirators involved (with John Wilkes Booth) in Lincoln's assassination. Gardner was the only photographer allowed at their execution by hanging, photographs of which would later be translated into woodcuts for publication in \"Harper's Weekly\".\n\nAfter the war, Gardner was commissioned to photograph Native Americans who came to Washington to discuss treaties; and he surveyed the proposed route of the Kansas Pacific railroad to the Pacific Ocean. Many of his photos were stereoscopic. After 1871, Gardner gave up photography and helped to found an insurance company. Gardner stayed in Washington until his death. When asked about his work, he said, \"It is designed to speak for itself. As mementos of the fearful struggle through which the country has just passed, it is confidently hoped that it will possess an enduring interest.\" He became sick in the late fall of 1882 and died shortly afterward on December 10, 1882, at his home in Washington, D.C. He was survived by his wife and two children. He was buried in local Glenwood Cemetery.\n\nIn 1893, photographer J. Watson Porter, who had worked for Gardner years before, tracked down hundreds of glass negatives made by Gardner, that had been left in an old house in Washington where Gardner had lived. The result was a story in the \"Washington Post\" and renewed interest in Gardner's photographs.\n\nA century later, photographic analysis suggested that Gardner had manipulated the setting of at least one of his Civil War photos by moving a soldier's corpse and weapon into more dramatic positions. In 1961, Frederic Ray of the \"Civil War Times\" magazine compared several of Gardner's Gettysburg photos showing \"two\" dead Confederate snipers and realized that the same body had been photographed in two separate locations. One of his most famous images, \"Home of a Rebel Sharpshooter\", has been argued to be a fabrication. This argument, first put forth by William Frassanito in 1975, goes this way: Gardner and his assistants Timothy O'Sullivan and James Gibson had dragged the sniper's body into the more photogenic surroundings of the Devil's Den to create a better composition. Though Ray's analysis was that the same body was used in two photographs, Frassanito expanded on this analysis in his 1975 book \"Gettysburg: A Journey in Time\", and acknowledged that the manipulation of photographic settings in the early years of photography was not frowned upon.\n\n\n\n"}

Parker was the last serving MP to have been elected before the Second World War, and with 48 years in Parliament, remains the longest-serving Labour MP in history.\n\nDagenham was held by Labour its inception and was without exception rated by election predictions as a safe seat. Dagenham hosts an at times shrinking skilled manual industry such as the Ford Motor Company works, which downscaled production in 2001, leading to replacement distribution and warehousing businesses as well as local regeneration under the Thames Gateway project from 2005 however higher than national unemployment immediately, including following the seat's abolition. See the main successor seat, Dagenham and Rainham for statistics. The largest-polling opposition candidate was Conservative since 1979, with the Liberal Party a greater or equal opponent in elections before that, vying for second place with that party.\n\nUnusually, the far-right British National Party was very active in this area periodically and its support led to some retained deposits by polling more than 5% of the vote on several occasions. Their candidate received nearly 10% of the vote in the 2005 general election and in the 2006 local elections returned 12 councillors to Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council.\n\nThe new constituency of Dagenham and Rainham included wards which had not traditionally supported the BNP or Labour, and published leaks of BNP databases that year showed that its membership in the area shown was diminishing.\n\n"}
{"id": "1827200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827200", "title": "David Premack", "text": "David Premack\n\nDavid Premack (October 26, 1925 – June 11, 2015) was Emeritus Professor of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, United States. He was educated at the University of Minnesota when logical positivism was in full bloom. The departments of Psychology and Philosophy were closely allied. Herbert Feigl, Wilfred Sellars, and Paul Meehl led the philosophy seminars, while Group Dynamics was led by Leon Festinger and Stanley Schachter.\n\nPremack started in primate research in 1954 at the Yerkes Primate Biology Laboratory at Orange Park outside Jacksonville, Florida. His first two chimpanzee subjects, Sarah and Gussie, started at the University of Missouri and traveled with him to the University of California, Santa Barbara, and then to the University of Pennsylvania, where he had nine chimpanzee subjects.\n\nPremack's first publication (1959) was a new theory of reinforcement (which became known as Premack's principle). It argued that the more probable response in any pair of responses could reinforce the less probable response—demonstrating that reinforcement is a relative, not an absolute property.\n\nThis theory predicts six conditions, all of which have been supported by evidence:\n\nPremack introduced the concept of Theory of Mind, with Guy Woodruff, in an article published in 1978. This has proven to be a fruitful concept in psychology and neuroscience. For example, hundreds of articles have been published on theory of mind in fields ranging from comparative psychology studies of cognitive capacities of animals to human developmental psychology studies of infant cognition to social neuroscience studies of the brain substrates that mediate simulations of mental processes in other individuals.\n\nPremack's analysis of same/different led him and his associates to show that chimpanzees can do analogies. Sameness/difference is not a relation between objects (e.g., A same A, A different B) or properties, it is a relation between relations:\nFor example: consider the relation between AA and BB, CD and EF on the one hand; and AA and CD on the other. AA and BB are both instances of same; the relation between them is \"same.\" CD and EF are both instances different; the relation between them therefore is \"same.\" \nAA is an instance of same, and CD an instance of different; the relation between them is \"different.\" This analysis set the stage for teaching chimpanzees the word \"same\" for AA, and \"different\" for CD. When taught these words, chimpanzees spontaneously formed simple analogies between: physically similar relations (e.g., small circle is to large circle as small triangle is to large triangle), and functionally similar relations (e.g., key is to lock as can opener is to can).\n\nA nonverbal method for testing causal inference designed by Premack made it possible to show that both young children and chimpanzees are capable of causal inference.\n\nPremack demonstrated that chimpanzees can reassemble a disassembled face, placing the eyes, nose, mouth in the appropriate place. In addition he showed that chimpanzees are capable of symbolic behavior. After viewing themselves in a mirror wearing, on different occasions, a hat, glasses, necklace, and given the picture of a face, 48 hours later, the chimpanzees applied clay to the top of the head (hat), to the eyes (glasses), and the throat (necklace) respectively.\n\nPremack further argued that young children divide the world into two kinds of objects, those that move only when acted upon by other objects, and those that are self-propelled and move on their own.\n\nHe argued that infants attribute intentionality to self-propelled objects that show goal-directed action. Further that infants attribute value to the interaction of intentional objects, e.g. positive value to gentle actions such as one object caressing another, negative value to harsh actions such as one object hitting another. In addition infants assign positive value when one object helps another to achieve its goal, negative value when one object hinders another from achieving its goal. Finally, he and Ann Premack argued: infants equate caressing with helping (despite their physical dissimilarity); and equate hitting with hindering (despite their physical dissimilarity.\n\nPremack has focused on cognitive differences between the intelligence of animals and humans. Human competence is domain general, capable of serving indeterminately many goals; animal competence is a narrow adaptation, serving only one goal. For instance, humans teach all possible activities (different ones in different cultures), whereas meerkats and cats, two of very few animals that teach at all, teach one activity: how to eat dangerous food such as scorpions in the one case, and how to stalk mice in the other. What explains the domain-generality of human competence? Human competence is composed of an interweaving of multiple evolutionarily-independent components; animal competence of a single evolutionary component.\nPremack debated of the nature of linguistic performance in apes with Jean Piaget and Noam Chomsky at the Centre Royaumont pour une Science de l'Homme, during one of the last moments when Jacques Monod could participate in intellectual debates shortly before his death.\n\nHe died at the age of 89, and was buried at Riverside National Cemetery in June 17, 2015.\n"}

As of March 2020, there are 479 species included in the official list. Of them, 70 are classed as accidental, 12 are classed as hypothetical, and five have been introduced to North America. In addition to the 479, two species are extinct and one has been extirpated.\n\nOnly birds that are considered to have established, self-sustaining, wild populations in Kansas are included on this list. This means that birds that are considered probable escapees, although they may have been sighted flying free in Kansas, are not included.\n\nThis list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the \"Check-list of North and Middle American Birds\", 7th edition through the 60th Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the \"Check-list\".\n\nThese tags are used to annotate some species:\n\n\nOrder: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae\n\nThe family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, bills which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils.\n\n\nOrder: GalliformesFamily: Odontophoridae\n\nThe New World quails are small, plump, terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits.\n\n\nOrder: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae\n\nPhasianidae consists of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump with broad relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans.\n\n\nOrder: PhoenicopteriformesFamily: Phoenicopteridae\n\nFlamingos are gregarious wading birds, usually tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down.\n\n\nOrder: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae\n\nGrebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.\n\n\nOrder: ColumbiformesFamily: Columbidae\n\nPigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere.\n\n\nOrder: CuculiformesFamily: Cuculidae\n\nThe family Cuculidae includes cuckoos, roadrunners, and anis. These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails, and strong legs.\n\n\nOrder: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Caprimulgidae\n\nNightjars are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs, and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically colored to resemble bark or leaves.\n\n\nOrder: ApodiformesFamily: Apodidae\n\nThe swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have very long, swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.\n\nOrder: ApodiformesFamily: Trochilidae\n\nHummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards.\n\n\nOrder: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae\n\nRallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and tend to be weak fliers.\n\n\nOrder: GruiformesFamily: Gruidae\n\nCranes are large, long-legged, and long-necked birds. Unlike the similar-looking but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Most have elaborate and noisy courting displays or \"dances\".\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Recurvirostridae\n\nRecurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds which includes the avocets and stilts. The avocets have long legs and long up-curved bills. The stilts have extremely long legs and long, thin, straight bills.\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Charadriidae\n\nThe family Charadriidae includes the plovers, dotterels, and lapwings. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short thick necks, and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water.\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Scolopacidae\n\nScolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the sandpipers, curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers, and phalaropes. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Different lengths of legs and bills enable multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Stercorariidae\n\nSkuas and jaegers are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They have longish bills with hooked tips and webbed feet with sharp claws. They look like large dark gulls, but have a fleshy cere above the upper mandible. They are strong, acrobatic fliers.\n\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Alcidae\n\nThe family Alcidae includes auks, murres, and puffins. These are short winged birds that live on the open sea and normally only come ashore for breeding.\n\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Laridae\n\nLaridae is a family of medium to large seabirds and includes jaegers, skuas, gulls, terns, kittiwakes, and skimmers. They are typically gray or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet.\n\nOrder: GaviiformesFamily: Gaviidae\n\nLoons are aquatic birds the size of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. Their plumage is largely gray or black, and they have spear-shaped bills. Loons swim well and fly adequately, but are almost hopeless on land, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body.\n\n\nOrder: CiconiiformesFamily: Ciconiidae\n\nStorks are large, heavy, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long stout bills and wide wingspans. They lack the powder down that other wading birds such as herons, spoonbills, and ibises use to clean off fish slime. Storks lack a pharynx and are mute.\n\n\nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae\n\nFrigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black, or black-and-white, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week.\n\n\nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae\n\nThe sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish.\n\n\nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae\n\nCormorants are medium-to-large aquatic birds, usually with mainly dark plumage and areas of colored skin on the face. The bill is long, thin, and sharply hooked. Their feet are four-toed and webbed.\n\nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae\n\nDarters are cormorant-like water birds with very long necks and long, straight beaks. They are fish eaters which often swim with only their neck above the water.\n\nOrder: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae\n\nPelicans are very large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. Like other birds in the order Pelecaniformes, they have four webbed toes.\n\n\nOrder: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae\n\nThe family Ardeidae contains the herons, egrets, and bitterns. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more secretive. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises, and spoonbills.\n\n\nOrder: PelecaniformesFamily: Threskiornithidae\n\nThe family Threskiornithidae includes the ibises and spoonbills. They have long, broad wings. Their bodies tend to be elongated, the neck more so, with rather long legs. The bill is also long, decurved in the case of the ibises, straight and distinctively flattened in the spoonbills.\n\n\nOrder: CathartiformesFamily: Cathartidae\n\nThe New World vultures are not closely related to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers, however, unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have a good sense of smell with which they locate carcasses.\n\nOrder: AccipitriformesFamily: Pandionidae\n\nPandionidae is a family of fish-eating birds of prey, possessing a very large, powerful hooked beak for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen eyesight. The family is monotypic.\n\n\nOrder: AccipitriformesFamily: Accipitridae\n\nAccipitridae is a family of birds of prey which includes hawks, eagles, kites, harriers, and Old World vultures. These birds have very large powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen eyesight.\n\n\nOrder: StrigiformesFamily: Tytonidae\n\nBarn-owls are medium to large owls with large heads and characteristic heart-shaped faces. They have long strong legs with powerful talons.\n\nOrder: StrigiformesFamily: Strigidae\n\nTypical owls are small to large solitary nocturnal birds of prey. They have large forward-facing eyes and ears, a hawk-like beak, and a conspicuous circle of feathers around each eye called a facial disk.\n\n\nOrder: CoraciiformesFamily: Alcedinidae\n\nKingfishers are medium-sized birds with large heads, long, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails.\n\nOrder: PiciformesFamily: Picidae\n\nWoodpeckers are small to medium-sized birds with chisel-like beaks, short legs, stiff tails, and long tongues used for capturing insects. Some species have feet with two toes pointing forward and two backward, while several species have only three toes. Many woodpeckers have the habit of tapping noisily on tree trunks with their beaks.\n\nOrder: FalconiformesFamily: Falconidae\n\nFalconidae is a family of diurnal birds of prey, notably the falcons and caracaras. They differ from hawks, eagles, and kites in that they kill with their beaks instead of their talons.\n\nOrder: PsittaciformesFamily: Psittacidae\n\nParrots are small to large birds with a characteristic curved beak. Their upper mandibles have slight mobility in the joint with the skull and they have a generally erect stance. All parrots are zygodactyl, having the four toes on each foot placed two at the front and two to the back. Most of the more than 150 species in this family are found in the New World.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Tyrannidae\n\nTyrant flycatchers are Passerine birds which occur throughout North and South America. They superficially resemble the Old World flycatchers, but are more robust and have stronger bills. They do not have the sophisticated vocal capabilities of the songbirds. Most, but not all, are rather plain. As the name implies, most are insectivorous.\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Laniidae\n\nShrikes are passerine birds known for their habit of catching other birds and small animals and impaling the uneaten portions of their bodies on thorns. A shrike's beak is hooked, like that of a typical bird of prey.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Vireonidae\n\nThe vireos are a group of small to medium-sized passerine birds. They are typically greenish in color and resemble wood warblers apart from their heavier bills.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Corvidae\n\nThe family Corvidae includes crows, ravens, jays, choughs, magpies, treepies, nutcrackers, and ground jays. Corvids are above average in size among the Passeriformes, and some of the larger species show high levels of intelligence.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Alaudidae\n\nLarks are small terrestrial birds with often extravagant songs and display flights. Most larks are fairly dull in appearance. Their food is insects and seeds.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Hirundinidae\n\nThe family Hirundinidae is a group of passerines adapted to aerial feeding. These adaptations include a slender streamlined body, long pointed wings, and short bills with a wide gape. The feet are adapted to perching rather than walking, and the front toes are partially joined at the base.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Paridae\n\nThe Paridae are mainly small stocky woodland species with short stout bills. Some have crests. They are adaptable birds, with a mixed diet including seeds and insects.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Aegithalidae\n\nLong-tailed tits are a group of small passerine birds with medium to long tails. They make woven bag nests in trees. Most eat a mixed diet which includes insects.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Sittidae\n\nNuthatches are small woodland birds. They have the unusual ability to climb down trees head first, unlike other birds which can only go upwards. Nuthatches have big heads, short tails, and powerful bills and feet.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Certhiidae\n\nTreecreepers are small woodland birds, brown above and white below. They have thin pointed down-curved bills, which they use to extricate insects from bark. They have stiff tail feathers, like woodpeckers, which they use to support themselves on vertical trees.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Troglodytidae\n\nWrens are small and inconspicuous birds, except for their loud songs. They have short wings and thin down-turned bills. Several species often hold their tails upright. All are insectivorous.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Polioptilidae\n\nThese dainty birds resemble Old World warblers in their structure and habits, moving restlessly through the foliage seeking insects. The gnatcatchers are mainly soft bluish gray in color and have the typical insectivore's long sharp bill. Many species have distinctive black head patterns (especially males) and long, regularly cocked, black-and-white tails.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Regulidae\n\nThe kinglets are a small family of birds which resemble the titmice. They are very small insectivorous birds in the genus \"Regulus\". The adults have colored crowns, giving rise to their names.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Muscicapidae\n\nThe Old World flycatchers are a large family of small passerine birds. These are mainly small arboreal insectivores, many of which, as the name implies, take their prey on the wing.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Turdidae\n\nThe thrushes are a group of passerine birds that occur mainly but not exclusively in the Old World. They are plump, soft plumaged, small to medium-sized insectivores or sometimes omnivores, often feeding on the ground. Many have attractive songs.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Mimidae\n\nThe mimids are a family of passerine birds which includes thrashers, mockingbirds, tremblers, and the New World catbirds. These birds are notable for their vocalization, especially their remarkable ability to mimic a wide variety of birds and other sounds heard outdoors. The species tend towards dull grays and browns in their appearance.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Sturnidae\n\nStarlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds. They are medium-sized passerines with strong feet. Their flight is strong and direct and they are very gregarious. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country, and they eat insects and fruit. Plumage is typically dark with a metallic sheen.\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Bombycillidae\n\nThe waxwings are a group of passerine birds with soft silky plumage and unique red tips to some of the wing feathers. In the Bohemian and cedar waxwings, these tips look like sealing wax and give the group its name. These are arboreal birds of northern forests. They live on insects in summer and berries in winter.\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Ptiliogonatidae\n\nThe silky-flycatchers are a small family of passerine birds which occur mainly in Central America, although the range of one species extends to central California. They are related to waxwings and like that group, have soft silky plumage, usually gray or pale-yellow. They have small crests.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Passeridae\n\nOld World sparrows are small passerine birds. In general, sparrows tend to be small plump brownish or grayish birds with short tails and short powerful beaks. Sparrows are seed eaters, but they also consume small insects.\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Motacillidae\n\nMotacillidae is a family of small passerine birds with medium to long tails. They include the wagtails, longclaws, and pipits. They are slender ground-feeding insectivores of open country.\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Fringillidae\n\nFinches are seed-eating passerine birds that are small to moderately large and have a strong beak, usually conical and in some species very large. All have twelve tail feathers and nine primaries. These birds have a bouncing flight with alternating bouts of flapping and gliding on closed wings, and most sing well.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Calcariidae\n\nThe Calcariidae are a group of passerine birds that had been traditionally grouped with the New World sparrows, but differ in a number of respects and are usually found in open grassy areas.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Passerellidae\n\nUntil 2017, these species were considered part of the family Emberizidae. Most of the species are known as sparrows, but these birds are not closely related to the Old World sparrows which are in the family Passeridae. Many of these have distinctive head patterns.\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Icteriidae\n\nThis species was historically placed in the wood-warblers (Parulidae) but nonetheless most authorities were unsure if it belonged there. It was placed in its own family in 2017.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Icteridae\n\nThe icterids are a group of small to medium-sized, often colorful passerine birds restricted to the New World and include the grackles, New World blackbirds, and New World orioles. Most species have black as a predominant plumage color, often enlivened by yellow, orange, or red.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Parulidae\n\nThe wood warblers are a group of small often colorful passerine birds restricted to the New World. Most are arboreal, but some like the ovenbird and the two waterthrushes, are more terrestrial. Most members of this family are insectivores.\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Cardinalidae\n\nThe cardinals are a family of robust, seed-eating birds with strong bills.

Current features of the park include a bandstand, tennis courts, boating lake, bowls club, skatepark, and a statue of Queen Victoria.\n\nOriginally Victoria Park was called \"The Marsh\", however by the turn of the 20th century the name Victoria Park had arisen. This is likely due to the Queen's popularity and the fact that many public celebrations, such as the Queen's jubilee were held in the park. The statue of her was originally placed in the Market Place in 1903, subsequently moved to Greenham House in 1933 and then to Victoria Park 1966.\n\nUp until the 1930s the park was common land, which included the right to graze cattle. The park used to be larger, however it has been gradually encroached upon by housing and the nearby A339 road to the eastern edge of the park, which up until the building of the Newbury bypass was the main route for traffic between Oxford and Southampton.\n\nThe A339 was in fact built on the path of a stream called the \"Minny Flush\", because of the number of minnows to be found in it.\n\nDuring the Second World War a temporary or emergency bridge was built over the Kennet and Avon canal, joining the park with the centre of town. The reason for this was because it was feared the Town Bridge was to be bombed which would have effectively split the town in two. Although it was supposed to be a temporary bridge it became a key crossing point and lasted up until 2001 when it was replaced with a new structure. Erroneously this was called the \"American Bridge\" because although it was built by civilian contractors for the War Office its plans had been stamped by the American Army, certifying its use for their forces. A major problem with the temporary bridge was that it was only 7 ft high, much lower than the recommended height of 8 ft 6 in.\n\n\n"}

As he grows up, Ataru became a bane on the town of Tomobiki thanks to his legendary misfortune, which has attracted all kinds of weirdos and aliens.\n\nEven as a child, he was extremely lecherous, but he had a constant friend in Shinobu Miyake, who eventually became his girlfriend by the time the manga began. Despite the steady date, Ataru continued to flirt with other women, but Shinobu stood by him. But all this changed one day when government agents took him to his house to explain a crisis that only he could remedy.\n\nOnce he arrived, he met Lum Invader, a gorgeous bikini-clad alien princess, for the first time. Ataru had been randomly selected by a computer to represent mankind in a game of tag with the fate of the Earth on the line. Lum herself represented the invading Oni race. Unable to catch the flying beauty, Shinobu promised to marry him if he won. Determined to do \"the stuff that married people do\", he succeeded in catching Lum by stealing her bikini top and grabbing her horns when she tried to get it back. In his moment of triumph, Ataru loudly declared \"Now I can get married!!\" However, Lum mistook this as a proposal to herself, which she accepted, and the two were immediately engaged.\n\nAtaru is a 17-year-old student at Tomobiki High School, Class 2-4. He is very lecherous and irreverent, and often tries to escape from his classwork due to laziness. Whenever he sees or hears a pretty girl, he immediately asks for her address and telephone number, but never succeeds. He chases after and tries to grope every woman, except his \"wife\" Lum Invader, no matter what the situation. However, it is revealed on several occasions that she is the only one he actually loves which he vehemently denies at any opportunity. Despite this, he typically treats her like a nuisance and constantly disobeys her. Perhaps as a form of irony, he is rather prudish about other matters, becoming outraged at the idea of his mom having an affair with Rei. Despite his behaviour towards women, he is remarkably chivalrous at other times claiming that if he hurt so much as one woman he couldn't call himself a man, something which the girls in his class all acknowledge.\n\nDespite how stupid he seems, Ataru often displays remarkable intelligence, particularly when escaping from Lum. At times he appears to be superhuman, with the durability of a cockroach and the rejuvenation of a lizard, possessing remarkable tenacity for a boy of his age and physique when trying to achieve something. As a result, he never gives up on his girl hunting, no matter how many times he fails or how badly Lum shocks him. Ataru is also very fast, and can often be seen wearing a track uniform. This blinding speed comes in handy when escaping from Lum.\n\nAtaru has occasionally let his good side shine through, most notably when he took care of the class caterpillar everyone else hated it, and when he went on a date with the ghost of a sick girl who had admired him from afar. But because of his reputation as a lecherous idiot, most of the cast is surprised whenever he does such a thing, believing that something is wrong with him. Actions like these, however, reveal his true personality, which may be the reason Lum fell in love with him despite his many flaws.\n\nA running gag throughout the series due to the fact that none of the cast has any respect for him. They will automatically believe he is the reason Lum is upset or has left for a period of time, despite the fact he had absolutely nothing to do with it.\n\nIn the beginning he is cold-hearted towards Lum and sees her as a nuisance preventing him from girl hunting, but by the time of the story (Vol. 18) he was completely okay with sharing a bed with her. Though he may not seem to really care for her, it is clear that Lum is the only one he truly cares for, something that she is grateful for. She just wishes Ataru would show it more often.\n\nIn the story (Vol. 21), in which he accidentally puts on boxing gloves that force him to grab and punch anyone who gets close enough to him, he continuously puts his own face in front of Lum's each time she gets too close, punching himself instead. This is just one of many instances when Ataru does everything he can to protect Lum from physical harm.\n\nWhen faced with the prospect of losing Lum, Ataru goes all-out to try to prevent it from happening, even at the expense of his own health. Near the end of the series, in the story introducing Inaba, he decides to protect the future where he and Lum get married after he sees how happy she is in this future. In Ataru's own ideal future, he had a harem containing every prominent female in the cast, but he decided to abandon it after he learned that Lum would not be with him, further signifying the love he has for her. But once the danger has passed, he goes back to his girl hunts as though nothing happened. Even so, the fact that he sacrifices himself to rescue Lum is enough to prove he truly cares. Also when she leaves for an extended period of time, he becomes very depressed and lonely in her absences.\n\nAs highlighted in the final story arc, where, even faced with the prospective of losing Lum and all his memories of her he refuses to give in her request of a proper love declaration, most the friction between Lum and Ataru stems from their clashing personalities: while Lum is utterly naïve and innocent about Earth customs and uses, but still truly wishes to be a proper and mature wife for Ataru and a prim daughter-in-law for her family, Ataru is more world-weary and savvy, yet he prefers to act as a flirty, happy-go-lucky teen, thus making Lum doubt of his commitment.\n\nAtaru can catch a katana blade with his bare hands. He had to teach himself this to help him deal with Shuutaro Mendou, who often carries such a sword and threatens to use it on him when insulted. At times, (mostly involving fights with Mendou) Ataru has demonstrated knowledge with some ninja abilities—one such skill is the Kawarimi no Jutsu (Body Replacement Technique). Another worthy note is his speed when properly motivated (a cute girl in sight or promises of special service from a girl); in the anime, Ataru has been seen (whether for comedic or serious purposes) to outrun a jet, and even Superman himself. Ataru also appears to have a good knowledge of the human body and its nerve points; in \"\"The Final Chapter\"\" movie, when Carla attempted to use her trademark bazooka, Ataru 'poked' her on a part of her back and caused her to spasm and lose control of her weapon, firing it randomly. In \"\"Beautiful Dreamer\"\", Ataru was able to escape Mujaki's dream trap where the priestess Sakura failed. In the sixth feature, \"\"Always, My Darling\"\", Ataru, powered by his lust, was able to pass traps similar to the ones of \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" through the use of a lecherous 6th sense. Also to be noted from this movie is his ability to draw out his h-chi/h-ki (hentai chi/ki) to create a powerful lust aura similar to that of Happosai from \"Ranma ½\". In the series, there was a time (through Ten's idiot ideas) when Sakura was haunted by a dream Ataru made originally for Lum. In the dream world where one's power is only limited to one's imagination, Ataru demonstrated powers similar to Neo from \"The Matrix\", including stopping projectiles with a wave of his hand. He learned how to counter Ten's firebreath with a frying pan. At times he's able to escape from his restraints and to top it up, he learned to exploit other characters weaknesses such as Rei's desire for food and Mendo's fear of darkness.\n\n\nEnglish\n\nCastilian Spanish\n\nItalian\n\nGilles Poitras has compared Ataru to Ryo Saeba stating that \"Ryo Saeba can best be described as what would happen if Ataru grew up to be handsome, physically fit, a crack shot with any given firearm and a hotshot gun for hire in Tokyo.\" Ataru was ranked third in Mania Entertainment's 10 Most Iconic Anime Heroes written by Thomas Zoth who commented that \"Against all odds, he finds himself the target of affection of beautiful, powerful women, making him the first protagonist with a harem.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1827237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827237", "title": "Factorial experiment", "text": "Factorial experiment\n\nIn statistics, a full factorial experiment is an experiment whose design consists of two or more factors, each with discrete possible values or \"levels\", and whose experimental units take on all possible combinations of these levels across all such factors. A full factorial design may also be called a fully crossed design. Such an experiment allows the investigator to study the effect of each factor on the response variable, as well as the effects of interactions between factors on the response variable.\n\nFor the vast majority of factorial experiments, each factor has only two levels. For example, with two factors each taking two levels, a factorial experiment would have four treatment combinations in total, and is usually called a \"2×2 factorial design\".\n\nIf the number of combinations in a full factorial design is too high to be logistically feasible, a fractional factorial design may be done, in which some of the possible combinations (usually at least half) are omitted.\n\nFactorial designs were used in the 19th century by John Bennet Lawes and Joseph Henry Gilbert of the Rothamsted Experimental Station.\n\nRonald Fisher argued in 1926 that \"complex\" designs (such as factorial designs) were more efficient than studying one factor at a time. Fisher wrote, \n\nNature, he suggests, will best respond to \"a logical and carefully thought out questionnaire\". A factorial design allows the effect of several factors and even interactions between them to be determined with the same number of trials as are necessary to determine any one of the effects by itself with the same degree of accuracy.\n\nFrank Yates made significant contributions, particularly in the analysis of designs, by the Yates analysis.\n\nThe term \"factorial\" may not have been used in print before 1935, when Fisher used it in his book \"The Design of Experiments\".\n\nMany people examine the effect of only a single factor or variable. Compared to such one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) experiments, factorial experiments offer several advantages\n\nIn his book, \"Improving Almost Anything: Ideas and Essays\", statistician George Box gives many examples of the benefits of factorial experiments. Here is one. Engineers at the bearing manufacturer SKF wanted to know if changing to a less expensive \"cage\" design would affect bearing life. The engineers asked Christer Hellstrand, a statistician, for help in designing the experiment.\n\nBox reports the following. \"The results were assessed by an accelerated life test. … The runs were expensive because they needed to be made on an actual production line and the experimenters were planning to make four runs with the standard cage and four with the modified cage. Christer asked if there were other factors they would like to test. They said there were, but that making added runs would exceed their budget. Christer showed them how they could test two additional factors \"for free\" – without increasing the number of runs and without reducing the accuracy of their estimate of the cage effect. In this arrangement, called a 2×2×2 factorial design, each of the three factors would be run at two levels and all the eight possible combinations included. The various combinations can conveniently be shown as the vertices of a cube ... \"\n\"In each case, the standard condition is indicated by a minus sign and the modified condition by a plus sign. The factors changed were heat treatment, outer ring osculation, and cage design. The numbers show the relative lengths of lives of the bearings. If you look at [the cube plot], you can see that the choice of cage design did not make a lot of difference. … But, if you average the pairs of numbers for cage design, you get the [table below], which shows what the two other factors did. … It led to the extraordinary discovery that, in this particular application, the life of a bearing can be increased fivefold if the two factor(s) outer ring osculation and inner ring heat treatments are increased together.\"\n\"Remembering that bearings like this one have been made for decades, it is at first surprising that it could take so long to discover so important an improvement. A likely explanation is that, because most engineers have, until recently, employed only one factor at a time experimentation, interaction effects have been missed.\"\n\nThe simplest factorial experiment contains two levels for each of two factors. Suppose an engineer wishes to study the total power used by each of two different motors, A and B, running at each of two different speeds, 2000 or 3000 RPM. The factorial experiment would consist of four experimental units: motor A at 2000 RPM, motor B at 2000 RPM, motor A at 3000 RPM, and motor B at 3000 RPM. Each combination of a single level selected from every factor is present once.\n\nThis experiment is an example of a 2 (or 2×2) factorial experiment, so named because it considers two levels (the base) for each of two factors (the power or superscript), or #levels, producing 2=4 factorial points.\n\nDesigns can involve many independent variables. As a further example, the effects of three input variables can be evaluated in eight experimental conditions shown as the corners of a cube.\n\nThis can be conducted with or without replication, depending on its intended purpose and available resources. It will provide the effects of the three independent variables on the dependent variable and possible interactions.\n\nThe notation used to denote factorial experiments conveys a lot of information. When a design is denoted a 2 factorial, this identifies the number of factors (3); how many levels each factor has (2); and how many experimental conditions there are in the design (2 = 8). Similarly, a 2 design has five factors, each with two levels, and 2 = 32 experimental conditions. Factorial experiments can involve factors with different numbers of levels. A 23 design has five factors, four with two levels and one with three levels, and has 16 × 3 = 48 experimental conditions.\nTo save space, the points in a two-level factorial experiment are often abbreviated with strings of plus and minus signs. The strings have as many symbols as factors, and their values dictate the level of each factor: conventionally, formula_1 for the first (or low) level, and formula_2 for the second (or high) level. The points in this experiment can thus be represented as formula_3, formula_4, formula_5, and formula_6.\n\nThe factorial points can also be abbreviated by (1), a, b, and ab, where the presence of a letter indicates that the specified factor is at its high (or second) level and the absence of a letter indicates that the specified factor is at its low (or first) level (for example, \"a\" indicates that factor A is on its high setting, while all other factors are at their low (or first) setting). (1) is used to indicate that all factors are at their lowest (or first) values.\n\nFor more than two factors, a 2 factorial experiment can usually be recursively designed from a 2 factorial experiment by replicating the 2 experiment, assigning the first replicate to the first (or low) level of the new factor, and the second replicate to the second (or high) level. This framework can be generalized to, \"e.g.\", designing three replicates for three level factors, \"etc\".\n\nA factorial experiment allows for estimation of experimental error in two ways. The experiment can be replicated, or the sparsity-of-effects principle can often be exploited. Replication is more common for small experiments and is a very reliable way of assessing experimental error. When the number of factors is large (typically more than about 5 factors, but this does vary by application), replication of the design can become operationally difficult. In these cases, it is common to only run a single replicate of the design, and to assume that factor interactions of more than a certain order (say, between three or more factors) are negligible. Under this assumption, estimates of such high order interactions are estimates of an exact zero, thus really an estimate of experimental error.\n\nWhen there are many factors, many experimental runs will be necessary, even without replication. For example, experimenting with 10 factors at two levels each produces 2=1024 combinations. At some point this becomes infeasible due to high cost or insufficient resources. In this case, fractional factorial designs may be used.\n\nAs with any statistical experiment, the experimental runs in a factorial experiment should be randomized to reduce the impact that bias could have on the experimental results. In practice, this can be a large operational challenge.\n\nFactorial experiments can be used when there are more than two levels of each factor. However, the number of experimental runs required for three-level (or more) factorial designs will be considerably greater than for their two-level counterparts. Factorial designs are therefore less attractive if a researcher wishes to consider more than two levels.\n\nA factorial experiment can be analyzed using ANOVA or regression analysis. To compute the main effect of a factor \"A\", subtract the average response of all experimental runs for which A was at its low (or first) level from the average response of all experimental runs for which A was at its high (or second) level.\n\nOther useful exploratory analysis tools for factorial experiments include main effects plots, interaction plots, Pareto plots, and a normal probability plot of the estimated effects.\n\nWhen the factors are continuous, two-level factorial designs assume that the effects are linear. If a quadratic effect is expected for a factor, a more complicated experiment should be used, such as a central composite design. Optimization of factors that could have quadratic effects is the primary goal of response surface methodology.\n\nMontgomery gives the following example of analysis of a factorial experiment:.An engineer would like to increase the filtration rate (output) of a process to produce a chemical, and to reduce the amount of formaldehyde used in the process. Previous attempts to reduce the formaldehyde have lowered the filtration rate. The current filtration rate is 75 gallons per hour. Four factors are considered: temperature (A), pressure (B), formaldehyde concentration (C), and stirring rate (D). Each of the four factors will be tested at two levels.Onwards, the minus (−) and plus (+) signs will indicate whether the factor is run at a low or high level, respectively.\n\nThe non-parallel lines in the A:C interaction plot indicate that the effect of factor A depends on the level of factor C. A similar results holds for the A:D interaction. The graphs indicate that factor B has little effect on filtration rate. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) including all 4 factors and all possible interaction terms between them yields the coefficient estimates shown in the table below.\nBecause there are 16 observations and 16 coefficients (intercept, main effects, and interactions), p-values cannot be calculated for this model. The coefficient values and the graphs suggest that the important factors are A, C, and D, and the interaction terms A:C and A:D.\n\nThe coefficients for A, C, and D are all positive in the ANOVA, which would suggest running the process with all three variables set to the high value. However, the main effect of each variable is the average over the levels of the other variables. The A:C interaction plot above shows that the effect of factor A depends on the level of factor C, and vice versa. Factor A (temperature) has very little effect on filtration rate when factor C is at the + level. But Factor A has a large effect on filtration rate when factor C (formaldehyde) is at the − level. The combination of A at the + level and C at the − level gives the highest filtration rate. This observation indicates how one-factor-at-a-time analyses can miss important interactions. Only by varying both factors A and C at the same time could the engineer discover that the effect of factor A depends on the level of factor C.\n\nThe best filtration rate is seen when A and D are at the high level, and C is at the low level. This result also satisfies the objective of reducing formaldehyde (factor C). Because B does not appear to be important, it can be dropped from the model. Performing the ANOVA using factors A, C, and D, and the interaction terms A:C and A:D, gives the result shown in the following table, in which all the terms are significant (p-value < 0.05). \n\n"}

It extends from the Front Range of the Rockies in central Colorado eastward approximately 80 miles toward the town of Limon. The western end of the Palmer Divide is popularly considered to be at Palmer Lake, located south of Denver and north of Colorado Springs. However, the divide between the two river basins actually extends west and then north to a junction with the Continental Divide at McNamee Peak.\n\nFor much of its length, it travels very roughly along the northern border of El Paso County. Thus, it forms a natural separator between the Denver and Colorado Springs metropolitan areas. The elevation along the divide varies between about , with the high point being Bald Mountain in southern Douglas County. This peak can be seen from I-25 just northeast of Monument Hill.\n\nThis uplifted area causes a slight increase in precipitation from the rest of eastern Colorado, resulting in the presence of the Black Forest, a peninsula of trees surrounded by dryer grassland plains.. The Palmer Divide is also implicated in enhanced landspout and tornado activity to the east of Denver in the Denver convergence vorticity zone (DCVZ).\n\nThis terrain feature is the cause of several small scale (microscale or mesoscale) weather patterns and it can make a great difference in the weather between Denver and Colorado Springs. Although the elevation technically qualifies it for the foothills category, it does not parallel a mountain chain as foothills generally do; instead, the Palmer Divide is perpendicular to the main chain of mountains. Due to the orientation of the Palmer Divide with respect to the eastern plains, the weather can be similar to that of the foothills during active weather with enhanced precipitation, especially during snowstorms. Cities and towns near the Palmer Divide include Parker, Castle Rock, Franktown, Elizabeth, Kiowa, Elbert, Sedalia, Larkspur, Palmer Lake, Monument, and northern communities of Colorado Springs, such as Gleneagle, Black Forest, and Briargate.\n\n"}

The Second Republic reincarnation of the Northern Elements Progressive Union and the Fourth Republican reincarnation of a similar namesake, the party was created by the supporters of Mallam Aminu Kano after his withdrawal from the National Party of Nigeria. The PRP was highly regarded as a progressive left of center political party. Some well known members of the party included Governors Abubakar Rimi, Balarabe Musa, Sabo Bakin Zuwo, Michael Imoudu, Dr. Edward Ikem Okeke, Bala Usman, Abdullahi Aliyu Sumaila, Sule Lamido, .S.G. Ikoku , Uche Chukwumerije, Muhammadu Dikko Yusufu, Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, Bashir Yusuf Ibrahim, Ghali Umar Na'Abba and Chinua Achebe — who served briefly as Deputy National President in the early 1980s.\n\nThe original party was banned following the Military Coup of 1984 led by General Buhari. In the Fourth Republic, the party with the same name resurfaced under the leadership of Abdulkadir Balarabe Musa; it could however not gather the same level of support as its Second Republic namesake.\n\nFollowing the formulation of a new constitution and an impending return to civil rule, Nigeria's top political elites organized a series of political conferences with a view to creating a political party that can transcend tribal boundaries, this culminated in the formation of the National Movement. In September 1978, however a brawl in one of the finalizing meetings of the movement between Malam Aminu Kano (then a significant leftist champion) and some former members of the Northern People's Congress led to a section of mostly Marxist intellectuals breaking off, alleging a sidelining of leftists in Nigeria, these leftist on 27 September 1978 formally pronounced the birth of the PRP.\n\nIn the 1980s, a coalition of politicians styling themselves 'Progressives' called for a national front against the ruling NPN and by 1981 a conference of opposition Governors in Nigeria had organized into a 'Progressive Governors Forum'. The active participation of PRP governors and MPs in these conferences that were by 1982 calling for a mega progressive party soon led to a crisis within the party. In mid 1982, suspension of PRP Governors by pro Aminu Kano elements and a subsequent rejection of the suspension by Michael Imoudu (then Vice President of the party) led to official fractioning.\n\nUpon formation of the PRP, an invitation was extended to Aminu Kano and other prominent leftists, and he was soon elected as the party's national president. In 1979, the party was able to capture 2 out of 19 states and came fourth in the national elections. Aminu Kano died in April 1983, just before that year's presidential election. Khalifa Hassan Yusuf succeeded him as party leader and presidential candidate.\n\nWith the return to Democratic rule in 1999, some former members of the now defunct PRP tried to reinstate it with little success. Though most of its former members still claim some sort of allegiance to the Sawabist block, they mostly have remained subsumed in other political parties.\n\nAlhaji Balarabe Musa was its chairman since its reincarnation during the 4th Republic. On 31 August 2018, Balarabe Musa quits active politics due to health issues, and stepped down from his chairmanship position of the party to allow young politicians take over. Falalu Bello was announced new chairman of the party.\n\n"}

She is also known for her authorship of wildlife pieces and books, including children's books.\n\nFaith Trumbull Corrigan was born in New York City, the daughter of a judge. She attended Barnard College for one year, then attended Rhode Island State College. But she dropped out of college once she got a job as a copy girl at the \"New York Daily News\". She later went to work for \"Life\" magazine. She worked for the U.S. Office of War Information in London during World War II.\n\nMcNulty was a staff writer at \"The New Yorker\" magazine from 1953 to 1994. In 1980, a collection of her \"New Yorker\" work was published as \"The Wildlife Stories of Faith McNulty\". For many years, she edited the annual \"New Yorker\" compilation of the year's best children's books.\n\nShe also frequently wrote children's books on wildlife, including \"How to Dig a Hole to the Other Side of the World\" in 1979 and \"When I Lived With Bats\" in 1998. Her 1966 book \"The Whooping Crane: The Bird that Defies Distinction\" was written for adults.\n\nHer husband, John McNulty, was also a writer for \"The New Yorker\" and with Thomas Wolfe, Truman Capote, Gay Talese and James Baldwin, a major figure in the development of the literary genre of Creative nonfiction, which is also known as literary journalism or literature in fact. As earlier here noted, having herself been years exposed to Harold Ross' New Yorker magazine's rarefied environment, which was then so promoting of this evolving genre, Faith's own major nonfiction work, \"The Burning Bed\", is, itself, a quintessential and quality example of the genre of literary journalism or, as Thomas Wolfe once labeled it, the “New Journalism”. After her husband John died in 1956, Faith remarried, to Richard Martin, a set designer and an inventive designer of set props.\n\n\"The Burning Bed\" was based on the true story of Francine Hughes, who set fire to the bedroom in which her husband was sleeping. Hughes defended herself by saying that her husband had been abusing her for 13 years. The jury at her trial ruled that she had been temporarily insane, and she was found not guilty.\n\nFaith had fonder memories of life with kinder family, however. \"\"I can remember my father in his nightshirt, digging for worms for the baby robin in the bathroom. That's the kind of household it was; I had woodchucks in the bathroom, cats, squirrels, chipmunks\"\", McNulty once said.\n\nTowards the end of her life, she wrote a weekly column for \"The Providence Journal\" on a local animal shelter run by the Animal Welfare League. Her mother had founded the Animal Welfare League in southern Rhode Island. McNulty had long been known for taking in stray animals at her farm.\n\nShe suffered a stroke in 2004. She died at her farm in Wakefield, Rhode Island.\n\nMcNulty's last book was illustrated by Steven Kellogg and published by Scholastic Books in 2005, \"If You Decide to Go to the Moon\"—a picture book written in the second person. Next year (after McNulty's death) it won a major \"year's best\" children's literary award, the Boston Globe–Horn Book Award for Nonfiction.\n\n"}
{"id": "1827286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827286", "title": "Germanic SS", "text": "Germanic SS\n\nThe Germanic SS () was the collective name given to paramilitary and political organisations established in parts of German-occupied Europe between 1939 and 1945 under the auspices of the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS). The units were modeled on the \"Allgemeine SS\" in Nazi Germany and established in Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway whose populations were considered in Nazi ideology to be especially \"racially suitable\". They typically served as local security police augmenting German units of the Gestapo, \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (SD), and other departments of the German Reich Main Security Office.\n\nBefore the war, both Denmark and Norway had fascist parties. The Danish National Socialist Workers' Party (\"Danmarks Nationalsocialistiske Arbejderparti\"; DNSAP) was founded in 1930, however, only held three seats in parliament by 1939. By 1933, Vidkun Quisling was the leader of a Norwegian political party, National Unity (\"Nasjonal Samling\", NS). However, it was not effective as a political party until the pro-German government took over after Norway was occupied. At that point, its state police, abolished in 1937, was reestablished to assist the Gestapo in Norway. In the Netherlands, the National Socialist Movement (\"Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging\", or NSB) had greater success before the war. The party had four per cent of the vote in the 1937 national elections. After the occupation in 1940, all these groups worked in their respective countries in support of Nazi Germany and became recruiting grounds for the Waffen-SS.\n\nThe Nazi idea behind co-opting additional Germanic people into the SS stems to a certain extent from the \"Völkisch\" belief that the original Aryan-Germanic homeland rested in Scandinavia and that, in a racial-ideological sense, people from there or the neighbouring northern European regions were a human reservoir of Nordic/Germanic blood. Conquest of Western Europe gave the Germans, and especially the SS, access to these \"potential recruits\" who were considered part of the wider \"Germanic family\". Four of these conquered nations were ripe with Germanic peoples according to Nazi estimations (Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, and Flanders). Heinrich Himmler referred to people from these lands in terms of their Germanic suitability as, \"\"blutsmässig unerhört wertvolle Kräfte\"\" (\"by blood exceptionally highly qualified people\"). Accordingly, some of them were recruited into the SS and enjoyed the highest privileges as did foreign workers from these regions, to include unrestrained sexual contact with German women. Eager to expand their reach, fanatical Nazis like Chief of the SS Main Office, Gottlob Berger considered the Germanic SS as foundational for a burgeoning German Empire.\n\nHimmler's vision for a Germanic SS started with grouping the Netherlands, Belgian, and French Flanders together into a western-Germanic state called \"Burgundia\", which would be policed by the SS as a security buffer for Germany. In 1940, the first manifestation of the Germanic SS appeared in Flanders as the \"Allgemeene SS Vlaanderen\" to be joined two-months later by the Dutch \"Nederlandsche SS\", and in May 1941 the Norwegian \"Norges SS\" was formed. The final nation to contribute to the Germanic SS was Denmark, whose \"Germansk Korpet\" (later called the Schalburg Corps) came into being in April 1943. For the SS, they did not think of their compatriots in terms of national borders but in terms of Germanic racial makeup, known conceptually to them as \"Deutschtum\", a greater idea which transcended traditional political boundaries. While the SS leadership foresaw an imperialistic and semi-autonomous relationship for the Nordic or Germanic countries like Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway as co-bearers of a greater Germanic empire, Hitler refused to grant them the same degree of independence despite ongoing pressure from ranking members of the SS.\n\nThe purpose of the Germanic SS was to enforce Nazi racial doctrine, especially anti-Semitic ideas. They typically served as local security police augmenting German units of the Gestapo, \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (SD), and other main departments of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA). Their principal responsibilities during wartime were to root-out partisans, subversive organizations, and any group opposed to Nazi ideas. In other cases, these foreign units of the SS were employed by major German firms to distribute propaganda for the Nazi cause among heir compatriots and to police and control workers. In addition, the inclusion of other Germanic peoples was part of the Nazi attempt to collectively Germanize Europe, and for them, Germanization entailed the creation of an empire ruled by Germanic people at the expense of other races.\n\nOne of the most notorious groups was in the Netherlands where the Germanic SS was employed to round-up Jews. Of the 140,000 Jews that had lived in the Netherlands prior to 1940, around 24,000 survived the war by hiding. Despite their relatively small numbers, a total of 512 Jews from Oslo were hunted down by the Norwegian Police and the \"Germanske SS Norge\" (Norwegian General SS); once caught, they were deported to Auschwitz. More Jews were rounded-up elsewhere, but the total number of Norwegian Jews captured never reached a thousand throughout the course of the war. Similar measures were planned by the SS against Danish Jews who totaled about 6,500 but most of them managed to go into hiding or escape to Sweden before the senior German representative in Denmark, SS-General Werner Best could marshal the SS forces at his disposal and complete his planned raids and deportations.\n\nThe following countries raised active Germanic SS detachments:\n\nAn underground Nazi organization also existed in Switzerland, known as the \"Germanische SS Schweiz\". It had very few members and was considered merely a splinter Nazi group by Swiss authorities.\n\nAfter World War II, many Germanic SS members were tried by their respective countries for treason. Independent war crimes trials (outside the jurisdiction of the Nuremberg Trials) were conducted in several European countries, such as the Netherlands, Norway and Denmark, leading to several death sentences, e.g. for the commander of the Schalburg Corps Knud Børge Martinsen.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1827303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827303", "title": "Striking clock", "text": "Striking clock\n\nA striking clock (also known as chiming clock) is a clock that sounds the hours audibly on a bell or gong. In 12-hour striking, used most commonly in striking clocks today, the clock strikes once at 1:00 A.M., twice at 2:00 A.M., continuing in this way up to twelve times at 12:00 P.M., then starts again, striking once at 1:00 P.M., twice at 2:00 P.M., up to twelve times at 12:00 A.M.\n\nThe striking feature of clocks was originally more important than their clock faces; the earliest clocks struck the hours, but had no dials to enable the time to be read. The development of mechanical clocks in 12th century Europe was motivated by the need to ring bells upon the \"canonical hours\" to call the community to prayer. The earliest known mechanical clocks were large striking clocks installed in towers in monasteries or public squares, so that their bells could be heard far away. Though an early striking clock in Syria was a 12-hour clock, many early clocks struck up to 24 strokes, particularly in Italy, where the 24-hour clock, keeping Italian hours, was widely used in the 14th and 15th centuries. As the modern 12-hour clock became more widespread, particularly in Great Britain and Northern Europe, 12-hour striking became more widespread and eventually became the standard. In addition to striking on the hour, many striking clocks play sequences of chimes on the quarter-hours. The most common sequence is Westminster Quarters.\n\nToday the time-disseminating function of clock striking is almost no longer needed, and striking clocks are kept for historical, traditional, and aesthetic reasons. Historic clock towers in towns, universities, and religious institutions worldwide still strike the hours, famous examples being Big Ben in London, the Peace Tower in Ottawa, and the Kremlin Clock in Moscow. Home striking clocks, such as mantel clocks, cuckoo clocks, grandfather clocks and bracket clocks are also very common.\n\nA typical striking clock will have two gear trains, because a striking clock must add a \"striking train\" that operates the mechanism that rings the bell in addition to the \"timekeeping train\" that measures the passage of time.\n\nThe most basic sort of striking clock simply sounds a bell once every hour. This sort of striking clock is called a \"passing strike\" clock. It is far simpler to create such a clock; all that must be done is to attach a cam to a shaft that rotates once an hour; the cam raises and then lets a hammer fall that strikes the bell. Originating before the mechanical clock itself, are water clocks. Such clocks were the earliest striking clocks; they rang once for each canonical hour. This sort of striking is still found in some skeleton clocks. It does not require a separate gear train to arm and release the single stroke sounded.\n\nThe Tang Dynasty Chinese Buddhist monk and inventor Yi Xing (683–727) created a rotating celestial globe that was given motive power by hydraulics of a turning waterwheel (acting as a large escapement), in the tradition of Zhang Heng (78–139). This featured two wooden gear jacks on its horizon surface with a drum and a bell, the bell being struck automatically every hour and the drum being struck automatically every quarter-hour. It is recorded that Confucian students in the year 730 were required to write an essay on this device in order to pass the Imperial examinations. The use of clock jacks to sound the hours were used in later clock towers of Song Dynasty China, such as those designed by Zhang Sixun and Su Song in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively.\n\nA striking clock outside of China was the clock tower near the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria, which struck once every hour. It was constructed by the Arab engineer al-Kaysarani in 1154. The Florentine writer Dante Alighieri made a reference to the gear works of striking clocks in 1319. The most famous original striking clock tower still standing is possibly the one in St Mark's Clocktower in St Mark's Square, Venice. The St Mark's Clock was assembled in 1493, by the famous clockmaker Gian Carlo Rainieri from Reggio Emilia, where his father Gian Paolo Rainieri had already constructed another famous device in 1481. In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell, which was put on the top of the tower where it is alternately beaten by the \"Due Mori\" (\"Two Moors\"), two bronze statues handling a hammer.\n\nDuring the great wave of tower clock building in 14th-century Europe, around the time of the invention of the mechanical clock itself, striking clocks were built that struck the bell multiple times, to count out the hours. The clock of the Beata Vergine (later San Gottardo) in Milan, built around 1330, was one of the earliest recorded that struck the hours. In 1335, Galvano Fiamma wrote: \n\nThe astronomical clock designed by Richard of Wallingford in 1327 and built around 1354, also struck 24 hours.\n\nSome rare clocks use a form of striking known as \"Roman Striking\" invented by Joseph Knibb, in which a large bell or lower tone is sounded to represent \"five\", and a small bell or high tone is sounded to represent \"one\". For example, four o'clock would be sounded as a high tone followed by a low tone, whereas the hour of eleven o'clock would be sounded by two low tones followed by a high tone. The purpose is to conserve the power of the striking train. For example, \"VII\" would be a total of three strikes instead of seven, and \"XII\" would be four strikes instead of twelve. Clocks using this type of striking usually represent four o'clock on the dial with an \"IV\" rather than the more common \"IIII\", so that the Roman numerals correspond with the sequence of strikes on the high and low bells.\nOne small table clock of this type sold from the George Daniels collection at Sotheby's on 6 November 2012 for £1,273,250.\n\nTwo mechanisms have been devised by clockmakers to enable striking clocks to correctly count out the hours. The earlier, which appeared in the first striking clocks in the 14th century, is called \"countwheel striking\". This uses a wheel that contains notches on its side, spaced by unequal, increasing arc segments. This countwheel governs the rotation of the striking train. When the striking train is released by the timekeeping train, a lever is lifted from a notch on the countwheel; the uneven notches allow the striking train to move only far enough to sound the correct number of times, after which the lever falls back into the next notch and stops the striking train from turning further.\n\nThe countwheel has the disadvantage of being entirely independent of the timekeeping train; if the striking train winds down, or for some other reason the clock fails to strike, the countwheel will become out of synch with the time shown by the hands, and must be resynchronized by manually releasing the striking train until it moves around to the correct position.\n\nIn the late seventeenth century, \"rack striking\" was invented. Rack striking is so called because it is regulated by a \"rack and snail\" mechanism. The distance a rack is allowed to fall is determined by a snail-shaped cam, thereby regulating the number of times the bell is allowed to sound. There was a misconception during the 20th century that the rack and snail mechanism was invented by British clergyman Edward Barlow in 1675-6. In fact, the inventor is unknown.\n\nThe snail-shaped cam is a part of the timekeeping train that revolves every twelve hours; often the snail is attached to the same pipe on which the hour hand is mounted. The diameter of the cam is largest at the one o'clock position, permitting the rack to move only a short distance, after which the striking train is stopped; it is smallest at the 12 o'clock position, which allows the rack to move the farthest. Striking stops when the last tooth of the rack has been taken up by the gathering pallet.\n\nBecause the number of strikes on the hour is determined by the position of the snail which rotates in tandem with the hour hand, rack striking seldom becomes desynchronized. Rack striking also made possible the repeating clock, which can be made to repeat the last hour struck by pressing a button. Rack striking became the standard mechanism used in striking clocks down to the present.\n\nAll hour striking mechanisms have these parts. The letters below refer to the diagram.\n\nClocks that have more elaborate functions than just striking the hours, such as chiming the quarter hours, or playing tunes, are called \"chiming clocks\" by clockmakers. The additional functions are usually run by a second complete striking mechanism separate from the (hour) striking train, called the \"chiming train\". These clocks have three weights or mainsprings, to power the timing train, striking train, and chiming train.\n\nThis describes how the rack and snail striking mechanism works. The labels refer to the drawing above.\n\nThe release lever \"(L)\" holds the rack \"(M)\" up when the clock is not striking. On the shaft of the minute hand (not shown), which rotates once per hour, there is a projection. As the change of the hour approaches, this projection slowly lifts the release lever, allowing the rack to fall until its point rests on the snail \"(N)\". The amount the rack can fall, and thus the number of strikes, is determined by the position of the snail. Exactly on the hour the striking train \"(G, H, K)\" is released and begins to turn. As it turns, the pins \"(G)\" repeatedly lift the hammer \"(F)\" and allow it to drop, ringing the gong \"(E)\". The gear ratios are arranged so that the gear wheel \"(H)\" makes one revolution each strike. A small pin \"(S)\" on this wheel engages the rack teeth, lifting the rack up by one tooth each turn. When the rack reaches the end of its teeth it stops the striking train from turning (using a mechanism not shown in the diagram, in such a way that gear \"(H)\" is held stationary with the pin \"(S)\" not engaging the rack, so that the rack is able to fall freely again on the next hour). So the number of strikes is equal to the number of teeth of the rack which are used, which depends on the position of the snail.\n\nSpecialized types of striking clocks:\n\nSome quartz clocks also contain speakers and sound chips that electronically imitate the sounds of a chiming or striking clock. Other quartz striking clocks use electrical power to strike bells or gongs.\n\n\n"}

In addition to many small fragments, at least eight large fragments with a total mass of 58 tons have been recovered, the largest weighing . The meteorite is named after the location where the largest fragment was found: near Cape York, in Savissivik, Meteorite Island, Greenland.\n\nThe date of the meteorite fall is debated, but was probably within the last few thousand years. It was known to local Inuit for centuries, who used it as a source of meteoritic iron for tools. The first foreigner to reach the meteorite was Robert Peary in 1894, with the assistance of Inuit guides. Large pieces are on display at the American Museum of Natural History and the University of Copenhagen Geological Museum.\n\nThe meteorite fell to Earth after the retreat of glaciers from the area. All fragments recovered were found at the surface, partly buried, some on unstable terrain. The largest fragment was recovered in an area where the landscape consists of \"flowing\" gravel or clay-like sediments on permafrost, indicating that it had been in place for no more than a few thousand years. Other estimates have put the date of the fall as 10,000 years ago.\n\nThe iron masses were known to Inuit as \"Saviksoah\" (Great Iron, later renamed \"Ahnighito\" by Robert Edwin Peary) weighing ; \"the Woman\", weighing ; and \"the Dog\", weighing . For centuries, Inuit living near the meteorites used them as a source of metal for tools and harpoons. The Inuit would work the metal using cold forging—that is, by hammering the metal with stones. Excavations of a Norse farm in 1976 located an arrowhead made of iron from the meteorite, dating from the 11th to 14th century AD; its presence is evidence of Norse journeys to northern Greenland.\nIn 1818, the British First Ross Expedition (led by Captain John Ross) made contact with Inuit on the northern shore of Melville Bay, who stated they had settled in the area to exploit a nearby source of iron. The Inuit described the location of this iron, but poor weather and sea ice prevented Ross from investigating further. Ross correctly surmised that the large iron rocks described by the Inuit were meteorites, and purchased several tools with blades made of the meteoritic iron.\n\nBetween 1818 and 1883, five further expeditions to the area were mounted by Britain, Sweden and Denmark, which all failed to find the source of the iron. Only in 1894 did a Western explorer reach the meteorite: Robert E. Peary, of the US Navy. Peary enlisted the help of a local Inuit guide, who brought him to Saviksoah Island, just off northern Greenland's Cape York. It took Peary three years to arrange and carry out the loading of the heavy iron meteorites onto ships. This process required the building of small, short railroad. Peary sold the pieces for in $40,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City where they are still on display. It is unknown whether the fragments were purchased from the Inuit or stolen.\n\nToday the piece named \"Ahnighito\" is open for viewing at the American Museum of Natural History in the Arthur Ross Hall. It is the second-heaviest meteorite to have been relocated (after El Chaco, at 37 tons). It is so heavy that it was necessary to build its display stand so that the supports reached directly to the bedrock below the museum. \n\nIn 1963, a fourth major piece of the Cape York meteorite was discovered by Vagn F. Buchwald on Agpalilik peninsula. The Agpalilik meteorite, also known as \"the Man\", weighs about , and it is currently on display in the Geological Museum of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Other smaller pieces have also been found, such as the Savik I meteorite found in 1911 and the Tunorput fragment found in 1984. Surveys of the area with a magnetometer in 2012 and georadar in 2014 found no evidence of further large iron fragments, either buried or on the surface.\n\nThe Cape York asteroid has been suggested by the crater discoverers to be a part of the asteroid which created the Hiawatha crater, but which split off prior to impact.\n\nEach of the most important fragments of Cape York has its own name (listed in order of discovery date):\n\n\nIt is an iron meteorite (medium octahedrite) and belongs to the chemical group IIIAB.\nThere are abundant elongated troilite nodules. The troilite nodules contain inclusions of chromite, sulfides, phosphates, silica and copper. The rare nitride mineral carlsbergite (CrN) occurs within the matrix of the metal phase. Graphite was not observed and the nitrogen isotopes are in disequilibrium.\n\n\n\n"}

The campus is adjacent to the Großhadern hospital campus, housing most of the Faculty of Medicine of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. The Faculty of Chemistry and a part of the Biology Faculty of the university also relocated to this new campus in 1999 and 2005.\n\nMunich's other \"science suburb\" is Garching, situated to the north on the opposite end of the U6 subway, with a large part of the Technische Universität München and several Max Planck Institutes.\n\nMartinsried is located in the \"Münchner Schotterebene\" and borders directly the urban area of Munich near Großhadern. The village center lies about 2.5 km from the centre of Planegg and about 15 km southwest of Munich's city centre.\n\nNorth of Martinsried, state road 2343 goes from Gräfelfing to Munich. To the south, state road 2344 goes from Planegg to the junction with the Munich-Fürstenried A95 motorway.\n\nThe Martinsried research campus can be reached by the Munich subway line U6 from the Großhadern (change to bus 266) or Klinikum Großhadern stations (15 min. walk). Planning is now underway for a possible future extension of the U6 line to Martinsried.\n\nIt is expected that from 2020, Martinsried will be connected directly to the Munich U-Bahn. On December 16, 2014, the Bavarian government decided to continue the Munich U-Bahn line 6-West from Klinikum Großhadern to Martinsried. 73.5 million euro were invested and an approximately 900-meter long route is to be built starting in 2016 and is due to go into operation in 2020. The extension of the U6 in the south to Martinsried was already decided on July 20, 2009 by the Munich City Council, but the originally projected 2014/2015 opening could not be realized. After the construction of the U9 clasp, the U6 at the Klinikum Großhadern would end and the U9 would continue beyond Martinsried. Later, Martinsried and Planegg could also be connected via S-Bahn.\n\nThe Catholic and Evangelical Churches each have a kindergarten in the village, and there are also three nursery schools maintained by the worker's welfare.

It followed a reunion of the band after a five-year breakup, and subsequent lineup changes which saw drummer Casey Royer and original guitarist Frank Agnew replaced, respectively, by Sandy Hanson of the Mechanics and by Agnew's younger brother, Alfie Agnew. \"Brats in Battalions\" explores several styles of punk rock and features new recordings of all three songs from 1981's \"Welcome to Reality\" EP, as well as cover versions of the traditional folk song \"The House of the Rising Sun\" and the Stooges' \"I Got a Right\". Singer Tony Brandenburg (here using the stage name Tony Montana) left the band after this album, and the Adolescents recorded one more album without him, 1988's \"Balboa Fun*Zone\", before breaking up for another 12 years.\n\nThe Adolescents had broken up in August 1981, two months before the release of their \"Welcome to Reality\" EP. Guitarist Rikk Agnew, who had left the band earlier that year after the release of their debut album, \"Adolescents\", joined the gothic rock band Christian Death, playing on their 1982 album \"Only Theatre of Pain\", and released a solo album, \"All by Myself\" (1982). Singer Tony Brandenburg formed a new band, the Abandoned, who released one album, \"Killed by Faith\" (1985). Bassist Steve Soto and guitarist Frank Agnew joined Los Angeles punk band Legal Weapon, playing on their 1982 album \"Death of Innocence\"; Agnew remained with them for \"Your Weapon\", released later that year, then moved on to Hvy Drt, playing on their 1985 \"Hvy Drt\" EP. Drummer Casey Royer, meanwhile, started D.I., taking on the role of singer, and was joined by Rikk Agnew for the \"D.I.\" EP (1983). Agnew then brought in his younger brother, Alfie Agnew, and the two remained in D.I. until 1987, playing on the albums \"Ancient Artifacts\" (1985) and \"Horse Bites Dog Cries\" (1986), and the \"Team Goon\" EP (1987).\n\nThe Adolescents lineup of Brandenburg (now using the stage name Tony Montana), Soto, Royer, and Rikk and Frank Agnew played a reunion show in April 1986 at Fender's Ballroom in Long Beach, California which led to the band re-forming. They played more shows and began working on material for a new album, recording a demo of two new songs, \"The Liar\" and \"Peasant Song\". Frank Agnew left the band after a few months, however, and was replaced by his younger brother Alfie, then Royer left the group that August. \"Casey wanted to keep D.I. going, and I lost interest\", said Frank. \"I think that when Casey left, the band lost a major part of its sound\", reflected Brandenburg in 1989. \"Casey always played this kinda surf beat. On top of that, he was a major part of the vocal attack. When Casey left, the band...changed\". Royer's replacement was Sandy Hanson, formerly of the Mechanics, a fellow Fullerton, California band that had been a key influence on the Adolescents.\n\nThe new Adolescents lineup entered Advanced Media Systems in Orange, California in the summer of 1986 to record their new album, co-produced by the band members and Gordon R. Cox. In addition to \"The Liar\" and \"Peasant Song\", they recorded five new songs: \"Brats in Battalions\", \"I Love You\", \"Skate Babylon\", \"Marching with the Reich\", and \"She Wolf\". They also rewrote one of the band's early songs, \"Do the Eddie\"—a joke song from a July 1980 demo tape written about Eddie Joseph of the band Eddie and the Subtitles, who had engineered the demo and subsequently became the band's manager—as \"Do the Freddy\". The remainder of the album consisted of new recordings of all three songs from the Adolescents' 1981 EP \"Welcome to Reality\" (\"Welcome to Reality\", \"Losing Battle\", and \"Things Start Moving\"), and cover versions of the traditional folk song \"The House of the Rising Sun\" and the Stooges' \"I Got a Right\". Mike McKnight played additional guitar parts on \"The Liar\"; he would go on to join Soto and Hanson in their post-Adolescents band Joyride during the early 1990s, and join the re-formed Adolescents from 2008–2013, playing on the albums \"The Fastest Kid Alive\" (2011) and \"Presumed Insolent\" (2013). Brandenburg came up with the concept for \"Brats in Battalions\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> cover art, a photograph of young boys holding various firearms.\n\nAfter completing the album, the Adolescents toured through much of the second half of 1986. Alfie Agnew then left the band at the end of the year to attend college and was replaced by Dan Colburn. The band toured for most of 1987, and \"Brats in Battalions\" was released that August in LP and cassette formats on the group's own label, SOS Records. In a retrospective review, Stewart Mason of AllMusic gave the album 2.5 stars out of 5, commenting that \"much had changed on the hardcore scene since the band's [1981] split, and \"Brats in Battalions\" finds the group foundering a bit as they try to decide which of the several available fragmentary mini-genres they slot into best: Queers/Descendents-style pop/punk, Redd Kross-style sarcastic power pop, Social Distortion-like Americana, Suicidal Tendencies-like punk metal? All are tried on, and while most of them suit the band fine, none of them are exactly right. Interestingly, the best tracks are the Flamin' Groovies-inspired raucous covers of the proto-punk classic 'I Got a Right' and a 'House of the Rising Sun' that turns the Animals' version of the song into a grinding howl of post-hardcore energy.\"\n\n\"Brats in Battalions\" was the Adolescents' last album with Brandenburg during the 1980s; both he and Colburn left the band by the end of 1987. Brandenburg stated in 1989, \"I was interested in other things (I had joined another band, the Flower Leperds), and the Adolescents touring cut into my school work\". Soto, Hanson, and Rikk Agnew decided to continue as the Adolescents with Soto and Agnew sharing lead vocal duties, and recruited guitarist Paul Casey, who left after a few months of touring. Frank Agnew rejoined the band and they recorded the album \"Balboa Fun*Zone\" (1988), released by Triple X Records. The band then broke up in April 1989. Triple X re-released \"Brats in Battalions\" in compact disc format in 1991. The Adolescents would reunite, with Brandenburg, in 2001.\n\nSongs from \"Brats in Battalions\" are performed on each of the band's live albums: \"I Got a Right\", \"The Liar\", \"Peasant Song\", and all three of the \"Welcome to Reality\" songs appear on \"Live 1981 & 1986\" (1989); \"Brats in Battalions\", \"Welcome to Reality\", \"I Love You\", \"Losing Battle\", and \"I Got a Right\" appear on \"Return to the Black Hole\" (1997), and \"Welcome to Reality\" and \"Things Start Moving\" appear on \"Live at the House of Blues\" (2004).\n\nWriting credits adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\n\n"}

The Wenchang dialect is considered the prestige form of the Hainanese language and is used by the island's provincial broadcasting media.\n\nIt was promoted from a county to a city on November 7, 1995, and had a population of 86,551 in 1999 (estimated 2006: 115,000).\n\nLocated in the northeastern part of Hainan, Wenchang covers a total area of . The east side has a long coastline along the South China Sea while the west borders Dongzhai Harbor, Haikou's Meilan District, Qionghai, and Ding'an County. The land is mostly hilly and contains both forest and agricultural areas. The entire area is populated with countless towns, farms, and villages.\n\nWencheng Town is located in the south of Wenchang, southeast of the provincial capital, Haikou. There is a central park and covered market downtown. Also located downtown is a large, modern campus. A new hospital is under construction on the outskirts.\n\nThe centre of the town is at near sea level with a canal running between one of the main streets and Wennan Old Street. This area has been subject severe flooding a number of times in the past. Another main road runs from the centre, uphill to the south. This road leads to Yilong Bay. Directly to the north of the town centre lies a fairly affluent hilltop community occupied by numerous housing compounds for retired military and other government workers.\n\nAuto-rickshaws and motorbikes provide the taxi service in the town. There are no car taxis.\n\nWennan Old Street is a visitor attraction located in the heart of the town.

It operates scheduled passenger, cargo and mail services around the Azores. It provides its own maintenance and handling services and manages four regional airports. Its main base is at João Paulo II Airport, Ponta Delgada. It also maintains a subsidiary for mid- and long-haul flights, Azores Airlines, the former \"SATA International\".\n\nOn August 21, 1941, a group of investors that included Augusto Rebelo Arruda, José Bensaude, Augusto d'Athayde, Corte Real Soares de Albergaria, Albano de Freitas da Silva and the company Bensaude & Co. Lda. (through its managing director António de Medeiros e Almeida) established Sociedade Açoreana de Estudos Aéreos Lda. (English: \"Azorean Aviation Studies Company, Ltd.\") to look into the feasibility of developing an inter-island airline that would link the Azorean archipelago and continental Portugal, and to obtain the governmental concession to do so. Augusto Rebelo Arruda eventually transferred his shares to Bensaude & Co. Lda. on September 15, 1947, although the first Sociedade Açoreana de Transportes Aéreos (English: \"Azorean Air Transport Company\") flight occurred from Santa Maria Airport in June, 1947. Captain Marciano Veiga piloted the first flight at the controls of a twin-engine Beechcraft (named \"Açor\") with seven passengers.\n\nThe Portuguese government granted temporary concession to the airline, which operated mail, cargo and air passenger services between São Miguel (Santana Field, until 1969), Terceira (at Achada, Lajes) and Santa Maria airports. By May 23, 1948, the airline had received two de Havilland DH.104 Dove aircraft to supplement its operations. On August 5, 1948, one of these Beechcraft failed to take to the air and crashes on take-off: all the passengers and crew were killed, prompting the suspension of flight operations. Two new DH.104 Doves would be delivered on May 23, 1949, with the capacity for nine passengers, and a Douglas DC-3 Dakota (CS-TAD) with capacity for 26 passengers would enter into by July 1, 1964.\n\nIn 1969, Nordela Airport (which would eventually be rechristened João Paulo II International) in Ponta Delgada (Relva) was inaugurated to civil traffic and would become the SATA base of operations. By 1971, TAP Air Portugal would begin Lisbon-Ponta Delgada service, and the airport in Horta, Faial would be inaugurated on August 24, 1971. The airline would eventually replace its aging fleet with Hawker Siddeley HS 748 turboprops (1972) with a larger capacity and range, that would fly between the newer airports constructed in all nine islands of the archipelago (between 1981 and 1983). In 1976, the Portuguese Air Force offered two Douglas DC-6 airplanes with a continental range. They were to be used effectively during a TAP strike that allowed SATA to extend their services to Lisbon. By April 14, 1977 it would have transported 1 million passengers throughout the regional market.\n\nIt was originally formed as a private company (50% interest held by Bensaude & Co.Lda.), but on 17 October 1980 it was reborn as a state-owned enterprise (SOE) operated by the Regional Government and TAP Air Portugal. It became a signatory of the European Regions Airline Association (ERA) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) charters in 1980 when it became a SOE, which it remains as of March 2014. The name of the airline changed in 1980 to SATA Air Açores.\n\nBetween 1989 and 1990, the inter-island HS 748 aircraft were gradually replaced by BAe ATP, after the first aircraft (named \"Santa Maria\") entered service in 1989. Eventually other planes would be added, reflecting the regional politics, each aircraft would be named after an island (\"Flores\", in 1990, and \"Graciosa\", in 1991), including a small Dornier 228-212 that was added to link the small island of Corvo, which substituted a CASA C-212 Aviocar Series 100 operated by the Portuguese Air Force. A revitalization program was initiated in the late part of the 2000s to rationalize and upgrade existing aircraft, resulting in a competition between ATR and Bombardier to supply the necessary equipment that met the needs of the archipelago. The decision to purchase Bombardier NextGen aircraft was not without controversy. The latest phase of its fleet renovation, which complies with a 15-20 year plan, began in July 2009, with the entry into service of two Bombardier Q200. It was followed up with a ceremony in Toronto, Ontario, on 25 January 2010, when the first \"next-generation\" Bombardier Q400, registration CS-TRD, was unveiled. The first of a series (four in all) began arriving at the end of January 2010; the second, registration CS-TRE, was received on 11 February, and the remaining planes arrived in March (registered CS-TRF and CS-TRG). The Q400 aircraft were projected for the short distance, high density markets with the archipelago and Macaronesian destinations. Its two PW150A engines, allows the planes to cruise at 667 km/hour, while transporting 80 passengers comfortably for distances up 2500 km, markedly within the limits of the archipelago.\n\nSATA introduced a new logo with the new fleet revitalization; referred to as \"Blue Island Açor\", it was inaugurated with the appearance of the first Bombardier aircraft, the Q200. Based on a year-long effort, and over 100 drafts, the re-imagined modern \"Açor\" brand was designed by Ivity-Corp. It is basically a geometric composite of nine-shapes, representing the nine islands of the archipelago, joined to form the ubiquitous \"Açor\" identified in legend. When exploded, each shape can be placed alone in geographical context to form a modernist map of the Azores.\n\nThe SATA Air Açores fleet consists of the following (as of April 2019):\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Cuffs may be either factory-designed or an after-market add-on modification.\n\nA leading-edge cuff is a wing leading-edge modification, usually a lightly drooped outboard leading-edge extension. In most cases of outboard leading-edge modification, the wing cuff starts about 50–70% half-span and spans the outer leading edge of the wing.\n\nThe main goal is to produce a more gradual and gentler stall onset, without any spin departure tendency, particularly where the original wing has a sharp/asymmetric stall behaviour with a passive, non-moving, low-cost device that would have a minimal impact on performance. A further benefit is to lowering stall speed, with lower approach speeds and shorter landing distances. They may also, depending on cuff location, improve aileron control at low speed.\n\nLeading-edge cuffs were called droop concept or drooped leading edge (DLE), or modified outboard leading edge in technical reports on stall/spin resistance. In these reports and others NASA reports on the same object, \"leading-edge cuff\" expression was not used.\n\nOther authors use simply \"cuff\" or \"wing cuff\".\n\nNASA led a general aviation stall/spin research program during the 1970s and 1980s, using model and full-scale experiments, seeking an effective means to improve stall/spin characteristics of general aviation airplanes.\n\nThe effect of a central notch at mid-span on the wing maximum lift was demonstrated in 1976. Following the testing of different leading-edge modifications on models and full-sized aircraft NASA eventually selected the semi-span \"drooped leading edge\" (DLE) that was tested first on an American Aviation AA-1 Yankee (1978).\n\nA 1979 NASA report explains that at high angles of attack the cuff discontinuity generates a vortex that acts as a fence, preventing the separated flow from progressing outboard. The lift slope has a flatter top and the stall angle is delayed to a higher angle. To reach high angles of attack, the outboard airfoil has to be drooped, some experiments investigating \"exaggerated\" drooped leading edges. The physical reason for the cuff effect was not clearly explained. \nSome much older reports gave some similar results. A 1932 NACA report about the effect of leading-edge slots of various lengths said, \"this is an indication that the slotted portion on each tip of the wing operates to some extent as a separate wing\".\n\nGetting higher lift coefficients as a result of boundary layer removal is well known on propellers (centrifugal force causing an outward displacement of the boundary layer), or wings (boundary-layer suction). The leading-edge cuff inboard vortex and wing tip vortex act both to remove the boundary layer of the wing's outer section, helping this low-aspect-ratio virtual wing to achieve a higher stall angle.\n\nAn important point is that the wing seems to be aerodynamically split in two parts, the inner stalled part and the outer part that behaves as an isolated low-aspect-ratio wing, able to reach a high angle of attack. The sharp discontinuity of the cuff is a key factor; all attempts by gradual fairing to suppress the vortex and the positive effects of the modification reintroduced an abrupt tip stall.\n\nAccording to a NASA stall/spin report,\"The basic airplanes: AA-1 (Yankee), C-23 (Sundowner), PA-28 (Arrow), C-172 (Skyhawk) entered spins in 59 to 98 percent of the intentional spin-entry attempts, whereas the modified aircraft entered spins in only 5 percent of the attempts and required prolonged, aggravated control inputs or out-of-limit loadings to promote spin entry.\"\n\nThe most successful NASA experimental results were obtained on a quite low 6:1 aspect ratio wing (Grumman Yankee AA-1), with a DLE placed at 57% of the semi-span. As the vortices (inboard cuff and wing tip) are efficient on a limited span length (about 1.5 times the local chord), a DLE alone is unable to preserve enough outboard lift to keep the roll control in case of high aspect ratio wing. Wings of more than 8 or 9 aspect ratio features other devices to complete the cuff effect, for example stall strips (as used on the Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 400), \"Rao slots\" (as used on the Questair Venture), vortex generators or segmented droop (as used on a NASA modified Cessna 210). In the case of the high aspect ratio Cessna 210 wing (AR =11:1), roll damping at stall was not as efficient.\n\nThe case of high-wing configuration wing was different. Full scale testing of a modified Cessna 172 showed that the outboard leading-edge cuff alone was not sufficient to prevent a spin departure, the aircraft lacking directional stability at high angles of attack. With a ventral fin added, the aircraft entered a controlled spiral in lieu of a spin.\n\nDepending on the cuff length and shape, the leading-edge cuff can exert an aerodynamic penalty for the stall/spin resistance speed obtained, resulting in some loss of cruise airspeed, although sometimes too small \"to be detected with production instruments\". In the case of the best wing modification of the AA-1 Yankee, the loss of cruise speed amounted to 2 mph or 2% and there was no speed loss in climb. Impact on cruise speed of the Piper PA-28 RX (modified T-tail) was not measurable. For the Questair Venture, \"In carefully controlled performance tests, the penalty in cruise performance was found to be imperceptible (1 kt)\".\n\nThe first use of outboard cuffs, other than on NASA research airplanes, was on the Rutan VariEze in 1978. They were wind tunnel tested in 1982, and later (1984) replaced by vortilons.\n\nFollowing aircraft were modified for experiments with the addition of an outboard leading-edge cuff as a result of NASA stall/spin research program :\n\nLeading-edge cuffs are used on 1900s high-performance light aircraft like the Cirrus SR20 and Columbia 350, which both gained FAA-certification with the device.\n\nSeveral after-market suppliers of STOL kits make use of leading-edge cuffs, in some cases in conjunction with such other aerodynamic devices as wing fences and drooping ailerons.\n\n\n"}

Portoviejo is the main political and economical centre of the Portoviejo River valley, which also includes the cantons of Santa Ana and Rocafuerte, where about are cultivated every year. The valley is rich in the production of tomatoes, onions, peppers, bananas, mangoes and other tropical fruits. The city, which was affected by economic crisis in the eighties and nineties, is now recovering but severe budget limitations and a huge unemployment rate present difficulties for local authorities. Portoviejo is a large commercial center for the province, where there are two shopping malls, one with a large hypermarket, 8 movie theaters, food court, and other stores. The city is home of the cancer treatment hospital \"Dr Julio Villacreses Colmont\" serving the provinces of Manabí and Esmeraldas. \n\nPortoviejo is the capital of Manabí Province and is important for coffee, cattle and fishing. Founded on March 12, 1535, it is one of the oldest cities in Ecuador and is the sixth largest.\n\nPortoviejo has a thriving agricultural-processing industry and is an important commercial center, with good road connections to Quito and Guayaquil.\n\nThe city houses over 200,000 inhabitants and is the capital of Manabi province as well as the main center for commercial activity such as coffee production, fishing and cattle ranching.\n\nFounded March 12, 1535 by the Spanish captain Francisco Pacheco as \"Villa Nueva de San Gregorio de Portoviejo\".\n\nOne of the greatest poets to come from Portoviejo was Vicente Amador Flor, who wrote many poems about the city.\n\nSandra Vinces, Miss Ecuador 2009 was born in the city.\n\nOn April 16 and 17, 2016, a large earthquake struck the region. Portoviejo sustained fatalities and building damage.\n\nPortoviejo has one of the richest and varied cuisines in the Ecuador. You can usually eat at a countryside restaurants located on the side of Portoviejo-Crucita roads. Also Manabí province is most important when it comes to gastronomy. \n\nIts typical meals eaten are: 1) Viche Fish or Shrimp 2) Corviche 3) Bolones de verde (with cheese or mixed) 4) Encebollado - Ceviche Braised Chicken 5) Broth of Hen Rice served with breaded fish or with shrimp 6) Cangrejada - White Serum or curd and among others.\n\nBeing in the Ecuadorian coast Portoviejo has many attractions inside and outside the city, one of them is the Crucita Beach that along with the Mangrove La Boca conform the coastal profile of this canton. Crucita is recognized worldwide as a great place for the practice of paragliding. Also as part of the rural area is the Enchanted Lagoon located in the parish of San Placido.\n\nChanging location towards the city, we find the Mamey Ecological Park (much visited by athletes and children) located beside the River Portoviejo, the UTM park and Botanical Garden is the largest park in the city and it also has a large animal reserve, The Forest Park is located in the north of the city and is the busiest, and finally the Central Park Vicente Amador Flor, whose interior is full of history. \nThe Cerro Jaboncillo archeological complex is a large complex with an archeological site and museum that exposes the history of the ancestors that inhabited the southern part of Manabí Province before the Spanish colonization.\n\nYou can stroll around the city easily by foot and visit the Parque Eloy Alfaro which faces the local cathedral. An interesting nearby village to visit is Sosote just a few minutes from Portoviejo, it's worth visiting because of its tagua workshops. \n\nThe local airport is used for domestic flights.\n\nPortoviejo has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen \"BSh\") with consistently very warm to hot conditions all year round. The advance and retreat of the cold Humboldt Current means there are two seasons: a lengthy dry season from May to December and a short wet season from January to April. The wet season is quite erratic owing to the El Niño Southern Oscillation:. in El Niño years rainfall may be several times the long-term mean.\n"}

He is a Member of Parliament representing Karnataka state in the Rajya Sabha. In July 2011, Jairam Ramesh was elevated to the Union Council of Ministers of India and appointed Minister of Rural Development and Minister (additional charge) of the new Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. However, in the cabinet reshuffle in October 2012, he has been divested of the portfolio of Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. He was previously the Indian Minister of State (Independent Charge) at the Ministry of Environment and Forests from May 2009 to July 2011.\nJairam Ramesh was born on 9 April 1954 in Chikmagalur, Karnataka, India. His father was C. K. Ramesh, and his mother, Sridevi Ramesh. His father was a Professor of Civil Engineering in IIT Bombay. He considers himself a practising Hindu with Buddhism ingrained and calls himself a 'Hind-Budh'.\n\nHe married K. R. Jayashree on 26 January 1981. He currently resides at Lodi Gardens, Rajesh Pilot Marg, New Delhi. Till his election to Rajya Sabha from Karnataka in July 2016, his permanent residence was at Khairatabad, Hyderabad, Telangana. His wife died in early 2019. \n\nSince childhood, Ramesh has been strongly influenced by Jawaharlal Nehru. He was fascinated by Nehru's modern approach to life, his bringing change in a traditional society and his liberal, humanist, rational approach to life, religion, men and civic matters. He considers himself a product of the Nehruvian era in many ways. An additional influence was Mohandas Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi), whom he originally saw as anti-modern, anti-science and anti-West. As he grew older and read Gandhi more and viewed him in the political and historical context in which he operated, he came to appreciate and acknowledge Gandhi much more. He has also studied Rabindranath Tagore deeply.\n\nJairam Ramesh attended St. Xavier's School, Ranchi in 1961–1963 in classes 3 to 5. He read Paul Samuelson (an American economist who won the Nobel Prize in 1970) and found him very interesting. His presentation, the substance of issues such as population and growth got him thinking of economics and the larger issues of life. Also when he was 17, in 1971, he read \"Asian Drama\", one of the early books of Gunnar Myrdal (a Swedish economist who won the Nobel Prize in 1974) and wrote to him at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Myrdal sent a very nice reply and said to stay in touch with him. \"Asian Drama\" was very influential to Ramesh's understanding of development planning in India.\n\nRamesh graduated from IIT Bombay in 1975 with a B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering. Between 1975–77 he studied at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College and received a Master of Science in Public Policy and Public Management. In 1977–78, he started on the Doctoral program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he had planned to study technology policy, economics, engineering, and management, as part of the newly established interdisciplinary technology policy programme. Family exigencies required him to return to India and that program remained incomplete.\n\nHe is a founding member of the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad and is a member of the International Council of the New York-based Asia Society. Ramesh has been a Visiting Fellow and Affiliated Researcher of the Institute of Chinese Studies, New Delhi, since 2002.\n\nIn 1978, Jairam Ramesh joined the World Bank for a short assignment. He returned to India in December 1979 and worked as assistant to economist Lovraj Kumar at the Bureau of Industrial Costs and Prices. From 1983 to 1985 he was Officer on Special Duty in the Advisory Board of Energy. He then worked in the Planning Commission (advisor to Abid Hussain), Ministry of Industry and other economic departments of the Central Government, including: analysing energy policy during 1983–85, reorganising the CSIR in 1986 and implementing technology missions during 1987–89.\n\nIn 1990, he worked as an \"Officer on Special Duty\" during the National Front administration of the V.P. Singh government. He reorganised India's international trade agencies in 1990 and was OSD to the Prime Minister in 1991. But he was removed from PMO within few weeks. In 1991 he worked in Manmohan Singh's finance ministry in the Narasimha Rao administration.\n\nRamesh participated in India's economic reforms in 1991 and 1997.

He was a member of the Congress Party's electoral strategy team for the 2004 Lok Sabha cycle.\n\nIn June 2004, he was elected to represent Adilabad District, Andhra Pradesh in the Rajya Sabha. Following the formation of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in 2004, he joined the National Advisory Council, where he helped put together UPA's National Common Minimum Program. From August 2004 – January 2006 he was a member of three committees of Parliament: the Public Accounts Committee, the Standing Committee on Finance and the Committee on Government Assurances and was a member of the Court of the Jawaharlal Nehru University.\nIn February 2009, with the 15th Lok Sabha elections approaching, he led the party's Poll Strategy Panel. At that time he resigned his posts as Minister of State for Power and Minister of State for Commerce and Industry. \n\nFollowing his 2009 re-election to the Indian Parliament, on 28 May 2009 Ramesh was given independent charge of Environment and Forests as Minister of State in the Congress-led administration.

Pedro was actively involved in the Reconquista and was also responsible for ousting and defeating the Vikings when they invaded Galicia in 858. Besides Vímara, Pedro was also the father of Hermenegildo Pérez. The old christian version of ‘Vímara’ is believed to be derived from ‘Weimar’ a name from any of several places called Weimar in Hesse and Thuringia, from Old High German wīh \"holy\" and mari \"standing water\". Although old-fashioned, it is still used in Portugal today as Guímaro.\n\nVímara was a vassal of the King of Asturias, Alfonso III, and was sent to reconquer and secure from the Moors (Arabs and Berbers who had invaded Visigothic Hispania), in the west coastal fringe of Gallaecia, the area from the Minho River to the Douro River, including the city of \"Portus Cale\", later Porto and Gaia, from where the name of Portugal emerged.\n\nThe Kingdom of Asturias was divided internally into several counties or royal provinces. Portus Cale was one of these asturian counties. In 868, Vímara Peres was named Count of Portugal by King Alfonso III after the reconquest of the region north of the Douro river. Later Portuguese historians viewed this event as the earliest milestone in the history of the state of Portugal, although Portugal did not achieve independence until the 12th century.\n\nHe was able to expel the Moors and founded a fortified town under his own name \"Vimaranis\" (of Vimar) which later became \"Guimaranis\", present day Guimarães (the Portuguese call it \"The Cradle City\"). Vímara Peres died in 873 in the territory of A Coruña.\n\nAlthough the identity of his wife is not recorded in any contemporary charters, her name could have been Trudildi. If that was the case, Vímara would have been the father of:\n\nDespite the lack of documentary proof, most historians agree that he was the father of:\n\n"}

He has also performed guest vocals for Cannabis Corpse, Overkill, Gojira, Eyehategod, Bad Brains and in 2018, his voice appears in the Soulfly song \"Dead Behind the Eyes\", and he is also the lead singer of side-project band Halo of Locusts.\n\nIn June 2012, Blythe was arrested in the Czech Republic and was indicted on manslaughter charges related to the 2010 death of Daniel Nosek, a 19-year-old fan, after a Lamb of God concert. The Czech court found that Blythe had pushed the fan off the stage and was \"morally responsible\" for the killing, but held that liability for Nosek's death also lay with promoters and security members, and ultimately acquitted Blythe of the criminal charges specifically.\n\nAfter his acquittal, Blythe recorded the album \"\" with Lamb of God, an album inspired by the manslaughter case and his detention time in the Czech Republic.\n\nBlythe joined Lamb of God in 1995, when they were still known as Burn The Priest. Before Lamb of God was successful, he had previously worked as a cook. He also has a side project band known as Halo of Locusts, who were founded around 2004. A full-length release was planned, but has yet to be released. They contributed to \"For the Sick\", the tribute album for Eyehategod, covering \"Dixie Whiskey\". \n\nIn 2005, Blythe worked with the metalcore outfit A Life Once Lost on their album \"Hunter\". He provided additional vocals on the track \"Vulture\" as well as helped in the vocal processing of the track. He later worked with them again in 2007 on \"Iron Gag.\" He also appeared on the song \"Skull and Bones\"\" by the band Overkill and \"Adoration for None\" on Gojira's album The Way of All Flesh. He was also featured on Shadows Fall song, King of Nothing, on their 2009 release, Retribution. Blythe was featured in many of his peers' DVDs, such as Killswitch Engage's \"(Set This) World Ablaze\" and Machine Head's \"Elegies\". Blythe was also featured in \"\", \"Working Class Rock Star\" and Melissa Cross's \"The Zen of Screaming\".\n\nHe appears as Luke in the movie \"The Graves\" (2009), written and directed by Brian Pulido.\n\nOn January 5, 2012, Blythe announced that he would be running for President of the United States via a blog entry entitled \"I want to be The Big Cheese\". His official campaign slogan was \"Fuck the dumb shit. Let's get real here.\" Blythe did not appear on the ballot in any of the fifty states or the District of Columbia.\n\nOn November 20, 2014, was announced that Blythe is to star in an action movie being made by Taiwanese metal band Chthonic. On July 14, 2015, Blythe's first book, \"Dark Days: A Memoir\" was released by Da Capo Press. During its first week of sales, it made the \"Publishers Weekly\" non-fiction National Best Sellers list.\n\nIn September 2015, Blythe revealed that during the first ten years of his career with Lamb of God he had also worked as a roofer and a restaurant worker in order to survive.\n\nIn February 2016, he joined Deafheaven on stage at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles with their song \"Dream House\". Seven months later, in September 2016, he was recruited by Eyehategod as a replacement for lead singer Mike Williams during their US tour.\n\nIn May 2017 he collaborated with DevilDriver on a Johnny Cash cover of \"Ghost Riders in the Sky\" from their country covers album.\n\nIn November 2019, Blythe was a member of the supergroup, Pigface, during the group's first tour in fourteen years. Initially, Blythe had agreed to perform with the group for the first five dates of the twelve-date tour but due to his enjoyment of it, he agreed to stay on for the remaining seven dates.\n\nIn April 2019, Blythe and Scottish brewery BrewDog announced a collaboration that yielded a non-alcoholic beer named \"Ghost Walker\". The name is taken from the Lamb of God song \"Ghost Walking\" which is on their 2012 album Resolution. Blythe wrote the lyrics to the song whilst beginning his journey to live an alcohol-free lifestyle.\n\nAt the end of June 2012, Blythe was arrested, charged and remanded in custody by the Czech authorities in connection with an incident that had happened during Lamb of God's previous concert in Prague two years earlier. According to the prosecution, Blythe shoved Daniel Nosek, a 19-year-old fan, off stage, thus inflicting fatal wounds on him. After being released on bail, which was contended by the State Attorney, Blythe denied responsibility for Nosek's death and pledged to return to attend the trial, which began on February 4, 2013.\n\nAccording to a verdict delivered by the Municipal Court in Prague on March 5, 2013, it was proven that Blythe had shoved Nosek off the stage and Blythe thus has the moral responsibility for his death. Due to the circumstances, however, Blythe was held not criminally liable with most of the blame lying with the promoters and the security members. The State Attorney appealed the verdict, but the acquittal was upheld by the Prague High Court on June 5, 2013.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has also been introduced in Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (south England, the Midlands, east Wales), Ireland, and Japan. It takes its name from John Reeves, an employee of the British East India Company in the 19th century.\n\nReeves's muntjac grows to high at the shoulder and in length, plus a short tail up to long. It weighs between when fully grown. It is reddish-brown in appearance with striped markings on its face. The belly is creamy-white, with lighter fur extending to the neck, chin, and the underside of the tail. The males have short antlers, usually or less, and long upper canines (tusks), usually about long. Females have bony lumps on their foreheads and localized black spots. The Taiwanese subspecies (\"M. r. micrurus\"), commonly known as the Formosan Reeves' muntjac, is darker than other subspecies.\n\nReeves's muntjac feeds on herbs, blossoms, succulent shoots, fungi, berries, grasses, and nuts, and has also been reported to eat tree bark. Eggs and carrion are eaten opportunistically. It is also called the barking deer due to its distinctive barking sound, though this name is also used for other species of muntjacs. The barking sound is common during mating or when provoked. Its preferred habitats are forest and shrubland. It is a solitary and crepuscular animal. Both males and females defend small territories that they mark with preorbital gland secretions that are thought to be pheromonal in nature. When fighting, males first use their antlers to push enemies off balance so they can wound them with their upper canine teeth.\nFemale muntjacs (known as \"does\") become sexually mature within the first year of life. Mating occurs throughout the year. Their gestation period lasts from 209 to 220 days. Females limit the number of mating bouts, though time between successive bouts is determined by males (known as \"bucks\").\n\nReeves's muntjacs were introduced to the grounds of Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire in the 19th century by the then Duke of Bedford. While a small number reportedly escaped, they are extremely unlikely to be the source of the current UK population. Larger numbers of Reeves's muntjac escaped from Whipsnade Zoo, and they are the more likely ancestors, in addition to other releases.\n\nSince the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, it has been illegal to release the species except where already established. Colonies exist throughout England south of Derbyshire, and the population continues to grow. In Ireland, sightings in 2008 caused the government, concerned at the risk of the species becoming established, to quickly introduce a year-round hunting season.\n\nIn the 1960s, several specimens escaped from an exhibition zoo in the Bōsō Peninsula in eastern Japan. By 2017, their numbers had reached at least 60,000. It is considered a harmful invasive species and has inflicted severe damage to ashitaba plantations. Also, Reeves's muntjac escaped a zoo on Izu Ōshima in 1970 when a fence fell due to a typhoon. A muntjac eradication effort on Izu Ōshima was undertaken in 2007–2014 but failed, and as of 2014, at least 11,000 individuals exist and have a yearly population growth rate of 15%. This failure has been blamed on inadequate survey methods that underestimated the population of the nocturnal species.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Reeve's muntjac is a protected species under the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance Cap 170. It is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN due to being generally common and widespread.\n\nThe tanned skin of Reeves's muntjac is notable for its softness and is occasionally used in beauty-care products, musical instruments, lenses, and antique items packaging. Low-fat muntjac meat is also noted for its culinary qualities.\n\nThis article incorporates material from the article in the Japanese Wikipedia, retrieved on 29 June 2017.\n"}

{"id": "1827412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827412", "title": "Air Force Systems Command", "text": "Air Force Systems Command\n\nThe Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) is an inactive United States Air Force Major Command. It was established in April 1951, being split off from Air Materiel Command. The mission of AFSC was Research and Development for new weapons systems.\n\nAFSC took on engineering functions which formerly resided in the Air Materiel Command (AMC), the Army Air Forces Technical Service Command (TSC), and the Air Technical Service Command (ATSC) as a separate research and development command in 1950. It incorporated Air Proving Ground Command in 1957. On 1 July 1992, AFSC and Air Force Logistics Command were merged to form the Air Force Materiel Command, located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.\n\nIn the reorganization of 1961, Air Force Systems Command acquired the materiel procurement function from Air Force Logistics Command. It was re-integrated with Air Force Logistics Command in 1992.\n\nThe origins of Air Force Systems Command date at least to the establishment of the Airplane Engineering Department by the Chief Signal Officer, U.S. Army, on 13 October 1917 at McCook Field, Ohio. Re-designated the Engineering Division of the U.S. Army Air Service in March 1919, this organization carried out the research, development and testing of military aircraft, engines, airships and accessories. Renamed the Materiel Division of the newly established Army Air Corps in October 1926, it undertook the procurement, supply and maintenance activities of Army aviation.\n\nAmerican aviation development fell behind its European rivals after the mid-1930s when Germany started a continental arms race. The threat of war at the decade's end began to change the situation. During the late 1930s American industry spent over $100 million annually on aviation research. University grants grew and military personnel enrollment in science courses increased. Leaders of the Army Air Forces (AAF) were alarmed by many of the new weapons that would revolutionize air warfare which had emerged from foreign laboratories. Radar, jet aircraft (Messerschmitt Me 262, Fieseler Fi 103 (V-1 flying bomb)) and ballistic missiles (V-2 rocket) had all either originated or been perfected outside the United States. Congress greatly increased funds for R&D. Subsequently, the engineering function resided in the Materiel Command, the AAF Technical Service Command, the Air Technical Service Command, and the Air Materiel Command.\n\nThe war had shown the destructiveness of aerial attack and made Arnold an aggressive advocate for aeronautical research. On 7 November 1944, General Henry H. \"Hap\" Arnold, Commanding General of the Army Air Forces, directed the AAF Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) to study the technological achievements of America's wartime allies and provide a blueprint for large-scale research and development of science and advanced technology for the Air Force.\n\nHowever, the Army Air Forces needed to achieve independence, which it did on 18 September 1947, with its transition into an independent United States Air Force. Also, the role of the Air Force in the postwar world had to be defined. The 1948 Finletter Commission published its report, \"Survival in the Air Age\", in January 1948. It set forth a new concept of airpower, i.e., a powerful peacetime force able to counter any enemy air attack. The Finletter Report inspired a group of senior USAF officers with backgrounds in engineering and related fields to analyze the existing R&D organization. Their findings, and the salesmanship of Generals Jimmy Doolittle and Donald Putt, convinced Air Force Chief of Staff General Hoyt S. Vandenberg to put the R&D mission on a more equal footing with the operational Air Force. Accordingly, and in the face of intense Air Staff opposition, on 23 January 1950, the Research and Development Command (RDC) came into being. Eight months later it was re-designated the Air Research and Development Command (ARDC) as a separate organization devoted strictly to research and development.\n\nResearch and Development Command was redesignated the Air Research and Development Command (ARDC) on 16 September 1950, and the Arnold Engineering Development Center was dedicated by President Harry S. Truman on 25 June 1951.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the new command began to make its mark. ARDC developed many ambitious aircraft and missile prototypes. Among the successes of this period were the North American F-86 Sabre swept wing fighter, the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress intercontinental bomber, the Lockheed C-130 Hercules turboprop transport and the Lockheed U-2 very high-altitude strategic reconnaissance aircraft. In addition, ARDC played a major contribution in the development of Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which became a priority after the world learned that the Soviet Union had detonated a thermonuclear (hydrogen) bomb on 23 August 1953. A crash program was employed which developed America's first ICBM (the SM-65D Atlas), that became operational in 1959. In terms of importance, resources, and success, the ICBM program was rivaled only by the famed Manhattan Project of World War II.\n\nAIMACO, the \"Supply Control Command compiler\" for Air Materiel Command, began circa 1959 with the definition of a high level programming language influenced by the UNIVAC Flow-Matic and COMTRAN programming languages. The draft AIMACO language definition was developed by an AMC-chaired committee of industry representatives from IBM, United States Steel, and AMC Programming Services. AIMACO had two compilers specified/designed (never produced), and AMC originally intended all programming for AMC systems would be in AIMACO and compiled on a UNIVAC at the AMC headquarters at Wright-Patterson AFB for operation on UNIVAC or IBM computers. An alternative compiler was designed by AMC Programming Services to compile systems on IBM computers for operation on IBM computers. AIMACO, along with FLOW-MATIC and COMTRAN, influenced development of the COBOL programming language.\n\nThe Atlas program led to the belief that the entire responsibility for deploying new weapons systems – from research, development and testing through procurement and production – should be vested in one command, rather than split between Air Materiel Command (AMC) and ARDC. It was the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1 in October 1957 that greatly influenced HQ USAF and ARDC thinking. The Stever Report, completed in June 1958, which proposed a new Air Force command for weapons acquisition. With this report and a realization of DoD's desire to assign the military space mission to the Air Force, the Air Force won the approval of Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara in 1961 for a new major command. In the reorganization and re-designation actions of 1961, Air Materiel Command was re-designated Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC) while Air Research and Development Command, gaining responsibility for weapon system acquisition, was re-designated Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) under General Bernard Schriever.\n\nUnder the Kennedy Administration, Secretary McNamara instituted powerful centralization tools in acquisition such as the Total Package Procurement concept (TPP). This system shifted many major program management functions to the Pentagon. Stressing computer modeling, concurrency, and paper competitions among the contractors, TPP sharply curtailed the flexibility of Systems Command program managers. Cost overruns and serious technical difficulties in such TPP programs as the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy and General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark lead to drastic changes in DoD acquisition practices. In 1970, Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard revised many McNamara policies. He decentralized the acquisition system and reemphasized prototyping in weapons development.\n\nAs the Vietnam War dominated the late 1960s and early 1970s, AFSC focused on quick solutions to the needs of operational units in the Southeast Asia (SEA) war zone. Areas such as Electronic warfare (ECM) (Douglas EB-66 Destroyer) were greatly expanded in response to the North Vietnamese Surface-to-air missile (SAM) air defense systems. The modification of transports (AC-130 Hercules, AC-119 Flying Boxcar) into gunships, improved reconnaissance sensors, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, Forward Looking Infrared Sensors (FLIR), and Precision-guided munitions all represented significant AFSC contributions to Air Force operations in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe sustained growth of Soviet power after the Cuban Missile Crisis challenged the entire spectrum of U.S. military capabilities. These factors led to a new wave of Air Force weapons development beginning in the late 1960s. Systems Command found itself managing a broad array of new tactical and strategic programs including the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters, the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II ground support aircraft, the LGM-118 Peacekeeper, the AGM-86 (air) and BGM-109 (ground) cruise missiles, the Boeing E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System, the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III transport, the Rockwell B-1 Lancer bomber, and a new generation of orbiting Reconnaissance satellites. These programs were the main activities of AFSC during the 1970s.\n\nWith the Reagan Administration's military buildup during the 1980s, the pace and scope of Air Force acquisition again escalated. Now the focus centered on the modernization of strategic systems which had atrophied during the Vietnam era and afterward. But increased activity and defense spending brought acquisition reform issues to the forefront. Cost, schedule, and quality problems troubled some major weapons programs.\nMedia stories about spare parts overpricing and questionable contractor overhead charges created a national sensation. This negative publicity, coupled with soaring federal deficits and reductions in domestic spending, contributed by the middle of the decade to a political backlash against Ronald Reagan's military programs. The situation gave enormous political impetus to reductions of defense spending and an overhaul of the nation's military establishment, including its weapons acquisition practices. AFSC led the way for acquisition improvements with greater reliance on multi-year contracting to stabilize weapons programs and increased investment in modernization programs for the defense industrial base. On 26 April 1984 the vice-commander of AFSC, Lieutenant General Robert M. Bond, was killed during a retirement visit to the 6513th Test Squadron at Groom Lake while flying a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 at over Mach 2.\n\nDuring this turbulent period, new and updated weapons systems continued to join the USAF. The B-1B Lancer was delivered to SAC in record time, though with significant problems that would hamper its service career for some time. Stealth technology found its way to the ramps in the form of the F-117 Nighthawk fighter-bomber and the B-2 Spirit bomber. After the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, AFSC helped restore the nation's space launch capability by quickly making available a family of new expendable launch vehicles such as the Delta II. Major gains were made in operational readiness rates through the Reliability and Maintainability (R&M) 2000 program.\n\nWith the 1992 reorganization of the Air Force, the functions of AFSC and Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC) were once again merged into the new Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its headquarters was located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. In 1961, the command was redesignated the Air Force Logistics Command with some of its functions transferred to the new Air Force Systems Command.\n\nThe logistics function can be traced before the earliest days of the Air Service, when the Equipment Division of the U.S. Army Signal Corps established a headquarters for its new Airplane Engineering Department at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe Airplane Engineering Department was established by the Equipment Division of the U.S. Army Signal Corps in 1917 for World War I experimental engineering. The department had a 1917 Foreign Data Section, and the Airplane Engineering Department was on McCook Field at Dayton, Ohio. McCook Field established the Air School of Application in 1919 and after WW I, the department was renamed the Airplane Engineering Division on 31 August 1918 under Lt Col Jesse G. Vincent (Packard co-engineer of the 1917 V-12 Liberty engine) to study and design American versions of foreign aircraft. The division merged in 1926 with the Air Service's Supply Division (formed by 1919) to form the Materiel Division (Air Corps). In 1920, the Engineering Division's Bureau of Aircraft Production completed the design of the Ground Attack, Experimental, (GAX) aircraft built as the Boeing GA-1, and designed the VCP-1 that won the initial Pulitzer Race in 1920 at Roosevelt Field (the division also designed the TP-1 and TW-1).\n\nThe \"Materiel Division\" was set up near Dayton, Ohio on 15 January 1926. The Materiel Division, controlled by the Office of the Chief of Air Corps (OCAC), possessed many characteristics of a major command. It brought together four major functions performed previously by three organizations: research and development (R&D), procurement, supply, and maintenance.\n\nWith the construction of nearby Wilbur Wright Field, McCook Field was closed on April 1, 1927, and was subsequently demolished after its assets moved to the new Wright Field, the latter serving as the Air Corps', and later the Army Air Forces', principal R&D center from 1927 to 1947, including the Physiological Research Laboratory which opened in 1935. By August 22, 1935, the division operated an Army Aeronautical Museum at Wright Field, and by November 22, 1935, had an \"Industrial War Plans Section\". F.B. Vose became the Materiel Division commander on October 19, 1940, with the division employing procurement inspectors at Wright Field the same year. The division had four Field Service Sections: San Antonio, Fairfield, Middletown, and Sacramento.\n\nThe Air Corps Maintenance Command was established under the Materiel Division on June 25, 1941 - less than a week after the creation of the USAAF itself on June 20, 1941 - to control supply and maintenance and retained the \"Air Corps\" designation that remained in effect for the USAAF's training and logistics units. \nOn December 11, 1941, with United States newly engaged in World War II, these four functions were divided between two organizations.\n\nMaintenance Command was redesignated Air Service Command and kept responsibility for supply and maintenance functions.\n\nThe chief of the Air Service Command, Brig. Gen. Henry J. F. Miller, was charged with supervision in the United States of all AAF activities pertaining to storage and issue of supplies procured by the Air Corps and with overhaul, repair, maintenance, and salvage of all Air Corps equipment and supplies beyond the limits of the first two echelons of maintenance. The command was directed to compile AAF requirements for Air Corps and other supplies, to procure equipment and supplies needed for the operation and maintenance of AAF units, to prepare and issue all technical orders and instructions regarding Air Corps materiel, and to exercise technical control* over air depots outside of the continental limits of the United States. In addition, ASC received responsibility for coordination with the Army technical services in the supply and maintenance of equipment and supplies procured by them for the use of the AAF. The new command was separated from the Materiel Division but remained a part of the Office of the Chief of Air Corps.\n\nBetween October 1941 and March 1942 the Air Service Command remained under the jurisdiction of the Chief of the Air Corps. Immediately after the beginning of the war it moved its headquarters to Washington, where it began operations on 15 December 1941. But a large portion of the headquarters organization remained at Wright Field, where it carried on the greater part of the command's activities.\nOn 15 December 1942 its headquarters moved back to Dayton, establishing itself at Patterson Field, immediately adjacent to Wright Field.\n\nOn 9 March 1942, the Air Service Command now became one of the major AAF commands, with relatively clear lines of responsibility\nand authority. Four air service area commands (San Antonio, Fairfield, Middletown, and Sacramento?), successors to the maintenance wings (and field service sections, originally activated in 1940?), had been activated in December 1941 to supervise the depots in given geographical areas. The depots, of which there were eleven by April 1942, became the centers of depot control areas, which directed the activities of subdepots within defined geographical limits. Unfortunately, the boundaries of some of the depot control areas overlapped those of air service areas, and since the depots were the real focal points of supply and maintenance activities, the air service areas never attained the status of fully functioning ASC subcommands. The air service areas were disbanded on 1 February 1943, to be succeeded by air depot control area commands, which were simply the eleven former depot control areas under a new name. The elimination of the four air service areas was apparently justified by subsequent operations; according to Maj. Gen. Walter H. Frank, commander of the ASC, the step proved \"most beneficial.\"\n\nIn May 1943 the air depot control area commands were redesignated air service commands with appropriate geographical designations, and from then to the end of the war the ASC conducted its operations in the continental United States through its eleven air service commands, each serving a separate geographical area. These air service commands included the Middletown Air Service Command (Olmsted Field, Middletown, Pennsylvania), Mobile ASC, Ogden Air Service Command, Oklahoma City Air Service Command, Rome Air Service Command, Sacramento Air Service Command, the San Antonio Air Service Command, the San Bernardino Air Service Command, Warner Robins Air Service Command, Warner Robins, as well as five-six others. In 1944 the air service commands were redesignated air technical service commands.\n\nThe Materiel Division was assumed responsibility for R&D and procurement, and was redesignated \"Air Corps Materiel Command\" on April 1, 1942. This became Air Force Materiel Command in April 1942; Materiel Command in April 1943, and AAF Materiel Command on January 15, 1944.\nOn July 17, 1944, Air Service Command and AAF Materiel Command were placed under a new organization, AAF Materiel and Services.\nOn August 31, 1944 AAF Materiel and Services was redesignated Army Air Forces Technical Service Command.\n\nThe 4000th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Command) was among units assigned directly to AAFTSC when it was established at Wright-Patterson Field on 1 April 1944.\n\nArmy Air Forces Technical Service Command was redesignated Air Technical Service Command (ATSC) on July 1, 1945.\n\nBy 1945, 14 bases in the United States were home to Air Technical Service Commands: Newark, New Jersey; Fairfield, California; Miami, Florida; Middletown, Pennsylvania; Mobile, Alabama; Ogden, Utah; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Oakland, California; Rome, New York; Sacramento, California; San Antonio, Texas; San Bernardino, California; the Spokane Air Technical Service Command at Spokane, Washington State; and Warner Robins, Georgia. (e.g., Chico AAF transferred to ATSC on 15 October 1944). In 1945, planning began for a separate United States Air Force as an independent service, and in January 1946, General of the Army Eisenhower and Army Air Forces General Spaatz agreed on an Air Force organization of seven major commands, including the Air Technical Service Command. ATSC centers were also renamed, e.g., the Kelly Field Logistics Depot's San Antonio Air Technical Services Command became the San Antonio Air Materiel Area in 1946.\n\nIn 1946 AAF Technical Service Command was redesignated Air Materiel Command, and the air technical service commands were reorganized as Air Materiel Areas:\n\nTwo further Air Materiel Areas were established in the late 1940s and early 1950s:\n\nThe functions of research and development and logistics were operated separately during World War II until they were reunited for several years in the late 1940s under Air Materiel Command. Among its forces was the Air Materiel Force, European Area, which was transferred from USAFE in on 1 January 1956. Air Materiel Force, European Area, at Chateauroux Air Depot, France, and Air Materiel Force, Pacific Area, at Tachikawa Air Base, Japan, were of Numbered Air Force status. Often these formations supervised Air Depot Wings, for example the 75th Air Depot Wing which was based at Chinhae Air Base in South Korea during the Korean War.\n\nIn 1950, research and development were split off into a separate formation, the Air Research and Development Command.\nFrom the early 1950s to 1962, the 3079th Aviation Depot Wing under AMC, headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, was a weapons of mass destruction unit of key strategic importance.

A violent cyborg with the face of Ernest Borgnine, a button on his chest which delivers orgasmic pleasure when pressed, and a phobia about vegetation, he was created by Steve Moore (under the pseudonym \"Pedro Henry\") and Alan Moore (no relation, under the pseudonym \"Curt Vile\").\n\nAxel first appeared in the strip \"Three-Eyes McGurk and his Death Planet Commandos,\" serialized in four issues of the British rock music magazine \"Dark Star\" in 1979–1980. Further Axel stories appeared in \"Sounds\" in the period 1980–1983; these were mostly written and drawn by \"Curt Vile.\". From that period onward, all Axel stories were written by \"Pedro Henry\" (Steve Moore).\n\n\"Warrior\" magazine, launched in 1982, featured \"Laser Eraser and Pressbutton\" stories in most issues, mostly drawn by Steve Dillon, in which Pressbutton was partnered with Mysta Mistralis, the \"Laser Eraser\" (a futuristic hit woman). A few other stories featured the bizarre supporting character Zirk, drawn by such artists as Garry Leach and Brian Bolland. (Zirk won the 1983 Eagle Award for Favourite Supporting Character.) \n\nAxel got his own six-issue title in 1984 from Eclipse Comics, which contained reprints of the Axel stories and other back-up material from \"Warrior\". This was followed by a further six issues of \"Laser Eraser and Pressbutton\" and a 3-D Special in 1985. This series contained new material written by \"Henry\" and drawn by Mike Collins.\n\nAxel and Mysta appeared in backup stories in \"Miracleman\" issues #9–12 (also published by Eclipse, 1986–1987); later one-off stories appeared in anthology publications, always written by \"Henry.\"\n\nIn 2006, British comics artist Jon Haward announced he was drawing a new story featuring Laser Eraser and Pressbutton. Written by Steve Moore (aka Pedro Henry) and with his approval, the story would go online on Haward's website in October 2006. However, Steve Moore died in 2014 and the story remains unpublished.\n\nPressbutton's origin was given in a stand-alone story in the \"Warrior Summer Special\" (Quality Communications, 1983), drawn by Steve Jackson. Originally a mild-mannered and plant-loving florist, he took delivery of plant matter which included a sentient, telepathic, anesthetic, carnivorous fungus which attacked his body from the feet upwards. All the time it was consuming him, it was empathising with him, apologising for eating him and preventing him from feeling the pain. By the time he was rescued, the only remaining parts of his body were his head, right arm and part of his chest. As a result of this damage, he became extremely embittered, especially against vegetation. When rebuilt as Pressbutton, he was fitted with a cleaver as a left arm and, because of his lack of genital equipment, an orgasm-inducing button on his chest clearly marked \"Press\". Unfortunately, this was sometimes used by later adversaries to disable him (in rapture) while he was attacking them.\n\n"}

Once a national leader in hog slaughtering, the company had the capacity to process most of the 850,000 hogs raised annually in Pennsylvania for slaughtering. In its heyday, Arbogast & Bastian slaughtered an average of 4,000 hogs daily.\n\nArbogast & Bastian, which was founded in 1887, operated for nearly one hundred years before filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1984, citing cash flow issues brought about by market turmoil and labor disputes. The company filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy the following year.\n\nWith the exception of the company's offices and the storage building, the Arbogast & Bastian plant was demolished in the late 1990s. These surviving offices were later incorporated into the America On Wheels museum, which was opened on the site of the former Arbogast & Bastian plant in 2008, while the storage building was redeveloped, becoming RB Collection - Ruozzi Brothers Collection: a trading and restoration center for classic and vintage automobiles along with Palazzo Reale, a residential complex with 7 luxury residences.\nThe Arbogast & Bastian Company was founded in 1887 by Wilson Arbogast and Morris Clinton Bastian. Arbogast, who was born in Freeburg, Snyder County, Pennsylvania, in 1851, was a school teacher by training who entered the wholesale provisioning business in the early 1880s in Phillipsburg, New Jersey. Bastian, who was born in Lower Macungie Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, in 1859, operated a general store in Allentown. \n\nThe two partners built a two-story building and stable at 25 Hamilton Street in Allentown, purchased two horses, and started supplying provisions and lard to local businesses and distributors. They used their building as a smoke house, and offered \"freshly-smoked\" hams and bacon that were prepared using meat purchased ready-cured from other suppliers. Ready-cured meat is that which, after slaughter and butchery, has been treated by curing in order to prevent the growth of bacteria and to reduce the opportunity for botulism to grow, allowing for much safer transport and storage. This grew into a strong business for Arbogast & Bastian, as previously these goods had to be imported from larger cities, such as New York City and Philadelphia, and suffered in freshness and quality because of the additional time and handling required to get the finished product to Allentown.\n\nIn 1890, the company added a hog slaughtering department, in order to offer fresh pork and sausages to their customers. The capacity of the plant increased from 150 hogs per week at inception, to over 1,500 hogs per week in 1905. Pork brands offered included \"Pure Home Rendered Lard\" and \"Old Dutch\" hams and bacon. With their venture in pork successful, Arbogast & Bastian soon expanded in a similar manner with beef, lamb, and mutton, first by purchasing ready-cured meat from suppliers in the West to learn the trade, then by building a full-scale abattoir and cold-storage facilities on-site. By 1905, the company was processing over 150 head of cattle, and a similar number of lambs and sheep, weekly.\n\nArbogast & Bastian Company was formally incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, with $200,000 in capital ($ million in dollars, adjusted for inflation.), on June 19, 1902. The additional capital raised by the corporation was used to purchase more land and to build larger refrigeration facilities and a power plant. By 1905, Arbogast & Bastian's revenues exceeded $1 million per year ($ million in dollars, adjusted for inflation.)\nThe large Arbogast & Bastian facility now occupied a prominent location at Hamilton and Front streets in Allentown, along the Lehigh River. The facility received livestock and transported goods via tracks run to the plant by the Lehigh Valley Railroad. On July 14, 1905, a large fire destroyed the original Arbogast & Bastian plant and the company rebuilt a larger, more modern facility. It was the first reinforced concrete meat packing plant in the United States. The Arbogast & Bastian plant, which allowed for more sanitary and safer operations, was designed and built in direct response to the unsanitary conditions in Chicago's meat packing plants exposed by Upton Sinclair in his book, \"The Jungle\", which led to the passage of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906.\n\nDuring World War II, 70 percent of Arbogast & Bastian's output went to the United States armed forces and through the Lend-Lease program to the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, China, France and other Allied nations. By 1973, Arbogast & Bastian had 700 employees processing 160 million pounds (73 million kg) of meat a year, and the company had the capacity to butcher 7,200 hogs and 1,000 cattle a week.\n\nArbogast & Bastian filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 11, 1984, citing cash flow issues brought about by \"two years of turbulent market conditions in the pork industry,\" a labor dispute with the Teamsters labor union and the recent shutdown of A&B's slaughtering operations. The bankruptcy was immediately triggered because one of the company's customers had issued a stop-payment on $800,000 worth of checks paid to Arbogast & Bastian. The firm's financial woes were further complicated by four large meat packing companies - Pork Cutters, Inc., Rotches Pork Packers, Inc., Otto Doerrer and Son, Inc. and Crissman, Inc. - who collectively failed to pay for nearly $5 million worth of pork carcasses and meat products purchased from Arbogast & Bastian in 1983 and 1984, according to charges made by the United States Department of Agriculture. In total, about 380 workers lost their jobs. Within months of filing for bankruptcy, Purity Bacon Products Corp., one of A&B's most profitable divisions, was sold for $1 million to an investor group led by Richard A. Strouce, the president of Arbogast & Bastian at the time it filed for bankruptcy. \n\nThe corporation filed for Chapter 7 liquidation on January 9, 1985. With the closure of Arbogast & Bastian, only two major meat processing facilities remained operating in the state of Pennsylvania - Hatfield Quality Meats of Hatfield, Pennsylvania, and Martins Abattoir & Wholesale Meats, Inc., with headquarters in Godwin, North Carolina.\n\nAs early as 1989, city officials in Allentown had announced plans to revitalize brownfield land along the Lehigh River, which included the abandoned Arbogast & Bastian plant. This redevelopment, which was to be known as \"Lehigh Landing,\" was originally to include a museum, a brewery, walking trails, a footbridge across the river, and a promenade for festivals. Allentown businessman Raymond E. Holland, former president of Holiday Hair Fashions, had purchased the abandoned Arbogast & Bastian plant for $250,000 in 1985 and gave it to the Allentown Economic Development Corp. as a charitable contribution in 1990. Development of \"Lehigh Landing\" was hindered by fundraising problems, environmental remediation issues, and even a national debate on pork barrel government spending. The iconic Arbogast & Bastian plant remained vacant for over a decade, often the victim of vandalism and suspicious fires. The plant was finally dismantled in late 1990s, and the company's large heart-shaped sign, long a fixture of the Allentown skyline, was taken down on June 30, 1998. The offices and the storage building of Arbogast & Bastian, had not been torn down and were later incorporated into the America On Wheels museum, which was opened on the site of the former Arbogast & Bastian plant in 2008 and RB Collection-Ruozzi Brothers Collection / Palazzo Reale, occupying the redeveloped storage building.\n\n"}

The borough was created following the 2002 municipal reorganization of Montreal. It comprises two main neighbourhoods, Côte-des-Neiges and Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, both former towns that were annexed by the city of Montreal in 1910.\n\nCôte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce is the most populous borough of Montreal, with a population of 165,031 according to the 2011 Census. It is an ethnically diverse borough, with 75 different nationalities present. There is also a large student population due to the presence of two universities, Université de Montréal and the Loyola campus of Concordia University.\n\nThe colonization of the territory of the borough of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, located on the western and northern flanks of Mount Royal, began in the era of New France. In the beginning, Côte-des-Neiges was frequented by vacationing members of the Montreal bourgeoisie. The first inhabitants of the area worked in the tanning industry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The area urbanized following the arrival of its first public and religious institutions in the late nineteenth century. The establishment of Université de Montréal in Côte-des-Neiges in the 1930s accelerated its growth.\n\nNotre-Dame-de-Grâce was agricultural land prior to the arrival of streetcars in 1908. The inhabitants of the area were predominantly anglophone. The urbanization of this area occurred between the 1910s and the 1930s. The establishment of Loyola College (today Concordia University) contributed to the growth of the area.\n\nSaint Joseph's Oratory opened on Queen Mary Road in Côte-des-Neiges in 1955. It is the most important pilgrimage site dedicated to St. Joseph in the world. The Décarie Expressway opened to motorists in 1966, in time for Expo 67. The construction of the expressway, which cuts through both Côte-des-Neiges and Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, resulted in the displacement of 285 families from their homes.\n\nLocated to the north and west of Mount Royal, it was part of the City of Montreal prior to the 2002 municipal mergers. It is composed of the districts of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and Côte-des-Neiges, and also includes the redeveloped neighbourhood Le Triangle.\n\nThe irregularly shaped borough is bounded on the north by the town of Mount Royal, on the east by Outremont, on the southeast by Ville-Marie and Westmount, on the south by Le Sud-Ouest, and on the west by Côte Saint-Luc, Hampstead, and Montreal West. The Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery is in the south east corner of the borough.\n\nIt has an area of 20,01 km² and a population of 163,110, making it the most populous of Montreal's boroughs.\n\nFollowing the 5 November 2017 Montreal municipal election, the current borough council consists of the following councillors:\n\nThe borough is divided among the following federal ridings:\n\nIt is divided among the following provincial electoral districts:\n\nCôte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce is served by two lines and ten stations of the Montreal Metro. There are seven stations in the borough on the Orange line: the Vendôme and Villa-Maria stations in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, and the Snowdon, Côte-Sainte-Catherine, Plamondon, Namur and De La Savane stations in Côte-des-Neiges. The borough is served by four stations on the Blue line, all of which are in Côte-des-Neiges: Snowdon, Côte-des-Neiges, Université-de-Montréal and Édouard-Montpetit.\n\nThe borough is currently served by two stations on four lines on the Réseau de transport métropolitain's commuter rail network. The Vendôme station, in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, is served by three lines, the Vaudreuil-Hudson line, the Saint-Jérôme line and the Candiac line. The Canora station in Côte-des-Neiges is served by the Deux-Montagnes and Mascouche line lines.\n\nThe borough is traversed by the Décarie Expressway.\n\nTwo universities are located in the borough. Université de Montréal and École Polytechnique de Montréal are located on Édouard Montpetit Boulevard in Côte-des-Neiges. HEC Montréal, the independent affiliated business school of Université de Montréal, is located nearby on Côte-Sainte-Catherine Road.\n\nConcordia University's Loyola campus, is located on Sherbrooke Street West in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, near Montreal West.\n\nThe \"Commission scolaire de Montréal\" operates Francophone public schools.\n\nThe English Montreal School Board (EMSB) operates Anglophone public schools.\n\nSeveral private high schools are located in the borough. These include the francophone \"Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf\", \"Collège Notre-Dame\" and \"Collège International Marie de France\", the bilingual Villa Maria High School and the anglophone Lower Canada College, Loyola High School and College Prep International.\n\nThe borough has four libraries of the Montreal Public Libraries Network: Benny, \"Bibliothèque interculturelle\", Côte-des-Neiges, and Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.\n\nAttractions in the borough include the Segal Centre for Performing Arts, Snowdon Theatre, the Empress Theatre, Saint Joseph's Oratory and the Gibeau Orange Julep fast-food restaurant. Other attractions also include the Montreal Holocaust Memorial Center and the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue of Montreal. The Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery is also located in the borough.\n\n\n"}

Beat poet and author Allen Ginsberg was a cousin.\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles in 1950, setting up a private practice and later teaching at the University of California at Irvine. \n\nAs a pioneer advocate of hallucinogens, Janiger introduced LSD to Cary Grant, Aldous Huxley, and other celebrities, taking the drug 13 times himself. He was interested in the relationship between creativity and mind-expanding drugs. He said,\nIt really took me out of a state in which I saw the boundaries of myself and the world around me very rigorously prescribed, to a state in which I saw that many, many things were possible... \n\nHe bought the then-legal drugs from a Swiss company, Sandoz Laboratories, abandoning his research when the U.S. Government began investigating researchers in 1962. The drugs were made illegal in 1966.\n\nIn 1986, he formed the Albert Hofmann Foundation for psychedelic research, named after the chemist who first synthesized LSD.\n\nHis work pre-dated Timothy Leary's but was not recognised widely because he did not publish his data. Janiger administered the drugs in his Los Angeles office.\n\nHe had 900 people take LSD (usually 2 micrograms per kilogram of bodyweight) and recorded their experiences. The participants included celebrities, actors, writers, college students, a Deputy Marshall, housewives, attorneys, clerical assistants, counselors, medical personnel, dentists, physicians, and engineers.\n\nA sub-study within Janiger's research focused specifically on artists and creativity. One patient of Janiger's, bipolar and alcoholic artist Frank Murdoch, was given a controlled, experimental dose of LSD for several months as an attempt to cure his late stage alcoholism (probably a less well-known purpose to his LSD experiments, but very common in the era). Janiger had Murdoch paint still lifes both on and off LSD, including a Kachina doll (that he reportedly had 70 other patients also paint).\n\nThe artists produced some 250 paintings and drawings after ingesting LSD. Historian Carl Hertel analyzed the art in 1971 and compared it to the artists' non-LSD work. Hertel found while the LSD art was neither superior nor inferior to the artists' other work, it was brighter, more abstract and non-representational, and tended to fill the entire canvas.\n\nTwo follow-up studies have been done. The first, done by Janiger around 1968, collected questionnaires from about 200 of the original participants. Much of this data remains unanalyzed and only a limited amount has been published.\n\nA second follow-up study was conducted in 1999 by Rick Doblin, Jerome E. Beck, Kate Chapman and Maureen Alioto, 40 years after the original experimental LSD sessions. Taped interviews were completed by 45 of Janiger's original participants, as well as Janiger himself. The study concluded that the experiences were positive overall, but only 1/3 of the follow-up subjects reported long-term benefits from the LSD experiences.\n\nAlso at the Irvine faculty, he studied the connection between hormones and premenstrual depression in women. Janiger was also involved with a group studying dolphins in their natural environment.\n\nJaniger published a few journal articles and one book entitled \"A Different Kind of Healing\" in 1993 with Philip Goldberg. The book details physicians' views on the use of alternative medicine within traditional medical practice. Janiger also coauthored a second book with Marlene Dobkin de Rios about his LSD research—which was published posthumously in 2003 by Park Street Press—entitled \"LSD, Spirituality, and the Creative Process\".\n\nHe took part in a documentary on psychedelics and creativity, \"Drug-taking, and the Arts.\"\n\nA dedicated ocean swimmer, in his 60s, Janiger won a race from Santa Monica to Venice Pier and swam regularly in the ocean for a further 10 years.\n\nJaniger was affectionately referred to as \"Oz \"by his close friends. He married three times; his third wife, Kathleen Delaney Janiger, died before him, in February 2001.\n\nHe died of heart and kidney failure at the Little Company of Mary Hospital on August 14 2001, in Torrance, California. He was 83.\n\nHe was survived by sons Robert and David; sister, Estelle Rosten and a brother, Nat. Oscar Janiger continued his psychicatric practice until a month before his death.\n\n"}

According to the American Association of School Librarians (AASL), a division of the American Library Association (ALA), the official title for a certified librarian who works in a school in the United States is \"school librarian\".\n\nThe school librarian performs four main leadership roles: teacher, instructional partner, information specialist, and program administrator. \n\nSchool librarians may read to children, assist them in selecting books, and assist with schoolwork. Some school librarians see classes on a \"flexible schedule\". A flexible schedule means that rather than having students come to the library for instruction at a fixed time every week, the classroom teacher schedules library time when the expertise of the school librarian, library and information skills, or materials are needed as part of a learning experience.\n\nIn the instructional partner role, school librarians collaborate with classroom teachers to create independent learners by fostering students' research, information literacy, technology, communication, and critical thinking skills. School librarians play a major role in infusing Information Literacy concepts and skills into secondary school curricula as well as enhances implementation of Information Literacy knowledge practices and dispositions into the secondary school education system.\n\nAs information specialists, school librarians develop a resource base for the school by using the curriculum and student interests to identify and obtain library materials, organize and maintain the library collection in order to promote independent reading and lifelong learning. Materials in the library collection can be located using an Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC).\n\nThis role also encompasses many activities relating to technology including the integration of resources in a variety of formats: periodical databases; Web sites; digital video segments; podcasts; blog and wiki content; digital images; virtual classrooms, etc. School librarians are often responsible for audio-visual equipment and are sometimes in charge of school computers and computer networks. \n\nAs program administrators, school librarians define, lead, and manage school library media programs by establishing library policies; overseeing the library budget; planning the physical and virtual library space; and maintaining a welcoming, positive, and innovative learning atmosphere. Librarians also maintain the collection by adding items to enhance curriculum and entice readers in order to have a good relationships with the patrons, both teachers and students. Many times, librarians are also responsible for repairing damaged books and periodicals.\n\nIn the United States, a teacher-librarian must have a baccalaureate degree and a certificate in secondary or elementary education, and must also complete a school library media program and gain a state certification. Programs in library science vary between institutions; however, state requirements must be met before a library media specialist is allowed to teach. Some school library media specialists hold the full Master of Library Science (MLS) or Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) degree, while others do not. In many instances, school librarians who have an MLS degree but do not have the requisite teaching credentials must obtain these teaching credentials and classroom teaching experience first before they are permitted to work as teacher-librarians. Often additional library science graduate coursework is required, focused specifically on issues pertaining to school librarianship.\n\nTeacher-librarians rely on the support of local, state, national, and international professional organizations for career and professional development, employment opportunities, and awards/grants/funding. Groups like the International Association of School Librarianship; the American Association of School Librarians; the School Library Association in the United Kingdom and the Australian School Library Association host websites, publish journals, and sponsor conferences, workshops, and other events which showcase current research and practices in the field.\n\nIn the United States, teacher-librarians are also supported by state organizations which advocate for teachers at the district and school level. A comprehensive list is available from the ALA.\n\nIn December 2015, school library programs fell under the benefits for the Every Student Succeeds Act, a law that opens the use of federal funding for school library programs.\n\n\n"}

Filming started 15 May 1934 with \"A Demon for Trouble\" (1934). \n\nOther films included \"Western Justice\" (1934), \"The Brand of Hate\" (1934), \"Smokey Smith\" (1935), \"Tombstone Terror\" (1935), \"Trail of Terror\" (1935), \"Alias John Law\" (1935), \"Big Calibre\" (1935), \"Sundown Saunders\" (1935), \"Brand of the Outlaws\" (1936) and \"The Kid Ranger\" (1936).\n\nIn June 1935 Katzman announced he would make six films written by Peter Kyne for Fox, starting with \"Danger Ahead\". He ended up taking over Bryan Foy's studios at Culver City and doing the films through his own company, Victory Pictures.\n\nFrom 1935–40 Victory produced two serials and 30 features, including Western film series starring Tom Tyler and Tim McCoy, and action pictures with Herman Brix and Bela Lugosi. Puritan ceased production in 1939.\n\nKatzman's films included crime films like \"Hot Off the Press\" (1935), \"Bars of Hate\" (1935), \"The Fighting Coward\" (1935) and \"Danger Ahead\" (1935), many of which were written by Peter B. Kyne.\n\nHe did \"The Phantom of the Range\" (1936), a Western. Katzman entered the world of serials with \"Shadow of Chinatown\" (1936) starring Bela Lugosi.\n\nIn June 1937 a fire damaged the building where Victory was based.\n\nIn January 1939 Victory announced they would make 20 more Westerns. However the company soon wound up.\n\nIn 1940 Katzman moved to Monogram Pictures and co-produced with Jack Dietz, under the names Banner Productions, the East Side Kids features of the 1940s, eight thrillers starring Bela Lugosi, and two musicals.\n\nIn April 1941 Katzman signed Lugosi to make three films, including one in collaboration with the East Side Kids. Lugosi wound up making nine films for Katzman.\n\nIn January 1943 Katzman signed a contract with stage star Frank Fay and screen comic Billy Gilbert for four films. Fay walked out on the series after the first film, \"Spotlight Scandals\" (1943), and Katzman replaced him with Gilbert's closest friend, Shemp Howard.\n\nIn September 1944 Katzman was offered a job producing serials for Columbia Pictures, starring with \"Brenda Starr, Reporter\" (1945) He followed this with the serials \"Jungle Raiders\" (1945) and \"Who's Guilty?\" (1945). With typical thrift, he produced them on the side, using Monogram's actors and technicians. \n\nThey were followed by \"Hop Harrigan\" (1946), \"Chick Carter, Detective\" (1946) and \"Son of the Guardsman\" (1947).\n\nHe continued to produce features for Monogram through 1948.\n\nKatzman's final East Side Kids movies were \"Docks of New York\" (1945), \"Mr. Muggs Rides Again\" (1945) and \"Come Out Fighting\" (1945). The series came to an abrupt end when its star Leo Gorcey wanted double the usual salary from Katzman. Katzman reacted by pulling the plug on the series. (Gorcey stayed with Monogram, which retooled the series as The Bowery Boys.)\n\nIn November 1945 Katzman replaced the rowdy East Side Kids with The Teen Agers, a wholesome gang of high-schoolers. These were vehicles for singer Freddie Stewart. It was an early example of Katzman's output aimed specifically at a teenage audience. He produced four in total: \"Freddie Steps Out\" (1946), \"Junior Prom\" (1946), \"High School Hero\" (1946) and \"Vacation Days\" (1948). \n\nIn June 1946 Katzman announced he would make his first feature for Columbia, a remake of \"The Last of the Mohicans\" starring Jon Hall. However, the first movies he ended up making at the studio were musicals. In August 1946 he signed Jean Porter to star in \"Betty Co-Ed\" (1946), made by Katzman's Monogram director Arthur Dreifuss. The film received excellent reviews, prompting Columbia to ask for three more. Porter left Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which was downsizing, to sign with Katzman. The three musicals were \"Little Miss Broadway\" (1947), \"Sweet Genevieve\" (1947) and \"Two Blondes and a Redhead\" (1947).\n\nKatzman and Dreifuss then made two films with singer Gloria Jean, who had been a star at Universal Pictures. Katzman was so pleased by \"I Surrender Dear\" (1948) that he devoted more time to it, and economized on her other picture, \"Manhattan Angel\" (1949). These were budgeted at about $140,000 per film. \n\nHe made some sports-themed features starring Gloria Henry, \"Racing Luck\" (1948) and \"Triple Threat\" (1948), and the musicals \"Mary Lou\" (1948) and \"Glamour Girl\" (1948). Boxoffice on these pictures declined, and Katzman started focusing on action pictures instead.\n\nDuring this time Katzman continued to produce serials for Columbia such as \"Jack Armstrong\" (1947), \"The Vigilante\" (1947), \"The Sea Hound\" (1947) with Buster Crabbe, \"Brick Bradford\" (1948), \"Congo Bill\" (1948) and the outstandingly successful \"Superman\" (1948). \n\nIn February 1948 Katzman had signed a five-year deal with screen Tarzan [Johnny Weissmuller]] to make \"jungle movies\" starting with two films a year for two years where the budgets would be at least $350,000. These turned into the \"Jungle Jim\" series starting with \"Jungle Jim\" (1948)\n\nKatzman continued to make musicals such as \"Mary Lou\" (1948) and \"Glamour Girl\" (1948) with Gene Krupa. However the box office performance of Katzman's action movies and serials, particularly \"Superman\" was outstripping those for his musicals and comedies, leading him away from those genres. From 1949 to 1954 he would produce only action fare for Columbia. These were Arabian Nights fantasies (bluntly euphemized by Katzman as \"tits and sand\"), western, action, and prison pictures. He would average ten features a year, producing them in four to ten weeks.\n\nIn October 1948 Katzman signed a seven-year, $4 million contract with Columbia to make four feature films a year through his Kay Pictures corporation, four serials a year via his Esskay Productions, and a \"Jungle Jim\" film series starring Johnny Weissmuller.. \n\nKatzman allowed a budget of $400,000 for \"The Prince of Thieves\" (1948), a version of the Robin Hood story starring Hall. Other action-orientated Katzman product around this time included \"The Lost Tribe\" (1949), a Jungle Jim movie; the serial \"Tex Granger\" (1948), \"Adventures of Sir Galahad\" (1949), \"Batman and Robin\" (1949) and \"Bruce Gentry – Daredevil of the Skies\" (1949); the action thriller \"The Mutineers\" (1949) with Hall; the swashbuckler \"Barbary Pirate\" (1949) and the crime movie \"Chinatown at Midnight\" (1949). \n\nCharles Schneer, who worked for Katzman in the 1940s and 1950s, said the producer:\nKnew everything there was to know about making a movie. He was a very enterprising fellow, and was enormously intuitive. But, he was a very tough taskmaster and a real skinflint. I managed to get along well with Sam, because I knew what he was and respected what he did. Unfortunately, all his input was negative. He never contributed anything positive. I would suggest an idea, and he would knock it down. I would argue with him, but I never got very far. He wouldn't say: 'Do this instead of that.' He would only say: 'Don't do this' — and I didn't. I certainly learned the value of a dollar from Sam.\nHis Monogram cameraman Robert Cline later recalled \"we did 106 features in six years, working six days a week - an average of 20 to 22 features a year. Those were \"B\" pictures... There was a clever writer in the unit. Sam would pick up a newspaper and say, \"Oh, here's a story.\" He'd give it to the writer and the writer would turn out a script. We'd go all over. We were actually a traveling unit, a very cohesive unit, and I really learned my trade from that experience.\"\n\nKatzman's main directors in this time were Lew Landers, William Berke, and Spencer Gordon Bennet. Berke specialised in Jungle Jim films such as \"Mark of the Gorilla\" (1950), \"Pygmy Island\" (1950), \"Captive Girl\" (1951) and \"Fury of the Congo\" (1951). Bennett did serials like \"Pirates of the High Seas\" (1950), \"Atom Man vs. Superman\" (1950), \"Cody of the Pony Express\" (1950), \"Mysterious Island\" (1951), \"Roar of the Iron Horse\" (1951) and \"Son of Geronimo\" (1952). Landers handled the other action films like \"State Penitentiary\" (1950), \"Revenue Agent\" (1950) with Lyle Talbot, \"Last of the Buccaneers\" (1950) with Paul Henreid, \"Chain Gang\" (1950), \"Tyrant of the Sea\" (1950) with Ron Randell, \"The Magic Carpet\" (1951) with Lucille Ball, \"Hurricane Island\" (1951) and \"When the Redskins Rode\" (1951) with Hall, \"A Yank in Korea\" (1951) with Lon McAllister. \n\nRichard Quine, then under contract to Columbia, made one of his first films as director for Katzman, \"Purple Heart Diary\" (1951); he later did \"Siren of Bagdad\" (1953) with Paul Henreid.\n\nLew Landers took over direction of Jungle Jim movies for \"Jungle Manhunt\" (1951) and \"Jungle Jim in the Forbidden Land\" (1952), and did \"California Conquest\" (1952) with Cornel Wilde. Fred F. Sears started work for Katzman with \"Last Train from Bombay\" (1952) starring Hall. Wallace Grissell directed \"A Yank in Indo-China\" (1952) and Sidney Salkow directed \"The Golden Hawk\" (1952) with Sterling Hayden and \"The Pathfinder\" (1952) with George Montgomery.\n\nBennett continued to make serials like \"Blackhawk\" (1952) and \"King of the Congo\" (1952), and branched into features such as \"Brave Warrior\" (1952) with Hall and a Jungle Jim film, \"Voodoo Tiger\" (1952). (In February 1952 Katzman renewed his options to make more Jim movies.) Paul Henreid returned to Katzman to star in \"Thief of Damascus\" (1952), directed by Will Jason.\n\nIn July 1952 Katzman announced he would make at least 15 films a year for seven years. In November 1952 this contract was amended so Katzman would make twenty films (seventeen features and three serials).\n\nWilliam Castle joined the Katzman group as director in 1953, starting with \"Serpent of the Nile\" (1953) with Rhonda Fleming and Raymond Burr. Castle later wrote in his memoirs that Katzman \"was a smallish man with a round cherubic face and twinkling eyes. Few people in the motion picture industry took him seriously as a producer of quality films, but to me, Sam was a great showman.\" Castle went on to make a series of films for Katzman including \"Slaves of Babylon\" (1953) with Richard Conte, \"Conquest of Cochise\" (1953) with John Hodiak, and two Westerns with Montgomery, \"Fort Ti\" (1953) and \"Masterson of Kansas\" (1954), \"The Law vs. Billy the Kid\" (1954) with Scott Brady, and \"The Saracen Blade\" (1954) with Ricardo Montalban.\n\nRichard L. Bare directed \"Prisoners of the Casbah\" (1953) with Gloria Grahame. William Berke returned to the Jungle Jim franchise with \"Valley of the Head Hunters\" (1953). Sidney Salkow made \"Jack McCall, Desperado\" (1953) with Montgomery and \"Prince of Pirates\" (1954) with John Derek. Spencer Bennet directed the Jungle Jim films \"Savage Mutiny\" (1953) and \"Killer Ape\" (1953). Former Columbia actor Fred Sears directed \"Target Hong Kong\" (1953) with Richard Denning, \"Sky Commando\" (1953) with Dan Duryea, \"The 49th Man\" (1953) with John Ireland and Denning, and \"Mission Over Korea\" (1953) with Hodiak and Derek. Seymour Friedman made \"Flame of Calcutta\" (1953). \n\nKatzman continued to produce serials such as \"The Great Adventures of Captain Kidd\" (1953), \"The Lost Planet\" (1953), \"Riding with Buffalo Bill\" (1954), and \"Gunfighters of the Northwest\" (1954)\n\nLee Sholem directed \"Jungle Man-Eaters\" (1954) which was the last official Jungle Jim movie although Weissmuller continued to make jungle action adventures for Katzman playing himself in \"Cannibal Attack\" (1954).\n\nIn July 1954 it was announced that Katzman's company, now called Clover Productions, would make 15 films for Columbia. Castle directed \"Jesse James vs. the Daltons\" (1954) in 3-D, \"The Iron Glove\" (1954) with Robert Stack, \"Charge of the Lancers\" (1954) with Paulette Goddard, \"Drums of Tahiti\" (1954) with Dennis O'Keefe and \"The Battle of Rogue River\" (1954) with Montgomery. Fred Sears had a solid hit with \"The Miami Story\" (1954).\n\nBy the mid 1950s television was making inroads into the action market. The Weissmuller series wound up after \"Jungle Moon Men\" (1955) and \"Devil Goddess\" (1955). Serials were gradually phased out, with his last ones being \"The Adventures of Captain Africa\", \"Perils of the Wilderness\" (1956) and \"Blazing the Overland Trail\" (1956). Instead Katzman decided to focus on films that would appeal to the 15-25 age group, which meant more sci-fi, horror, and rock musicals.\n\nIn August 1954 Katzman said he had 14 films lined up, with four more to come, and had assigned four writers to projects: Curt Siodmak to \"The Creature with the Atom Brain\", Berne Giler on \"Dressed to Kill\", Ray Buffum on a juvenile delinquency story, and Robert E. Kent on a Western.\n\n\"Creature with the Atom Brain\" (1955) led to a series of science fiction films, such as \"It Came from Beneath the Sea\" (1955), with effects from Ray Harryhausen. That was produced by Charles H. Schneer who had worked with Katzman for a number of years; Schneer and Harryhausen went on to make \"Earth vs. the Flying Saucers\" (1956) for Katzman before Schneer left to form his own unit at Columbia.\n\nKatzman would still make Westerns such as \"The Gun That Won the West\" (1955), \"Seminole Uprising\" (1955), \"Blackjack Ketchum, Desperado\" (1955) and \"Duel on the Mississippi\" (1955), swashbucklers like \"Pirates of Tripoli\" (1955) and crime films such as \"New Orleans Uncensored\" (1955), \"Chicago Syndicate\" (1955), \"The Crooked Web\" (1955), \"The Houston Story\" (1956), \"Miami Exposé\" (1956) and \"Inside Detroit\" (1956). He also did the occasional thriller like \"Uranium Boom\" (1956).\n\nHowever his work had an increasing teenage focus, such as \"Teen-Age Crime Wave\" (1955) and \"Rumble on the Docks\" (1956), which were teen orientated crime films. He also started making musicals again, with rock music. \n\nIn 1955, when Columbia wanted to release the first rock-and-roll musical, Katzman reworked elements from his Gloria Jean musical \"I Surrender Dear\" into one of Columbia's biggest hits, \"Rock Around the Clock\" (1956) with Bill Haley and His Comets. This cost $300,000 and earned over $4 million. This was followed by \"Cha-Cha-Cha Boom!\" (1956), \"Don't Knock the Rock\" (1957, again with Bill Haley), \"Calypso Heat Wave\" (1957) and \"Juke Box Rhythm\" (1959, scheduled for Bill Haley but ultimately made with singer Jack Jones). \n\nKatzman also produced horror films for the teenage audience, including \"The Werewolf\" (1956), \"The Man Who Turned to Stone\" (1957), \"The Giant Claw\" (1957), \"Zombies of Mora Tau\" (1957) and \"The Night the World Exploded\" (1957).\n\nIn May 1957 Katzman told \"Variety\" that he felt, “A picture that makes money is a good picture —- whether it is artistically good or bad. I’m in the five and dime business and not in the Tiffany business. I make pictures for the little theatres around the country.” He added that his movies were normally budgeted between $250,000 and $500,000. He said at Columbia he had made 110 pictures, none of which lost money, and the average gross was $1 million. He said at least 40% of the 110 pictures made were still in release.\n\n“Every picture I make now has a selling gimmick aimed at the young audience,\" he said in 1957, and he made car movies, horror stories, science fiction and music. He said his pictures are the “bread and butter” pictures of the industry. “I don't get ulcers with the type of pictures I make,” he said. \n\nIn 1957 Katzman made seven films for Columbia, including non-teenage fare such as \"Utah Blaine\" (1957), \"Escape from San Quentin\" (1957), \"The Tijuana Story\" (1957) and \"The World Was His Jury\" (1957). He announced in December of that year he would double this amount over the following twelve months.\n\nKatzman's later films at Columbia included some teen melodramas \"Going Steady\" (1958) and \"Life Begins at 17\" (1958);\"Crash Landing\" (1958), a disaster film based on Pan Am Flight 6; a pair of war films starring Van Johnson shot in Europe, \"The Last Blitzkrieg\" (1959) and \"The Enemy General\" (1960); and a drama about trapeze artists, \"The Flying Fontaines\" (1959).\n\nKatzman signed a deal with 20th Century Fox starting with \"The Wizard of Baghdad\" (1960), an \"Eastern\" with Dick Shawn. He did this under a verbal agreement with Buddy Adler then in September 1960 Robert Goldstein signed him to a three picture contract. These were to be \"Gentlemen Pirates\" written by Mel Levy, a film about Mississippi gamblers written by Jesse Lasky Jr. and Pat Silver, and \"Cypress Gardens\" by Lou Morheim. He said at the time that Hollywood was making too many blockbusters and \"the motion picture business must deal in a saleable product of entertainment at a price the public can afford and not price itself out. of the market.”\n\nHe wound up making only one more film at Fox, \"Pirates of Tortuga\" (1961), a swashbuckler similar to many of the films he made at Columbia. \n\nHe returned to Columbia to make \"The Wild Westerners\" (1962), a Western, as well as two \"twist\" movies starring Chubby Checker, \"Twist Around the Clock\" (1961) and \"Don't Knock the Twist\" (1962). These were scene-for-scene remakes of Katzman's Bill Haley musicals, with almost identical scripts.\n\nKatzman accepted an offer to move his operation to MGM in 1963. He started with a low budget musical \"Hootenanny Hoot\" (1963), which led to several more musicals: \"Get Yourself a College Girl\" (1964) and \"When the Boys Meet the Girls\" (1965) (a remake of \"Girl Crazy\"). MGM also financed three of Katzman's best known movies: two films starring Elvis Presley, \"Kissin' Cousins\" (1964) and \"Harum Scarum\" (1965), as well as \"Your Cheatin' Heart\" (1964), a biopic of Hank Williams starring George Hamilton. Hamilton later wrote in his memoirs that \"Jungle Sam cracked the whip, whacked the cane and the whole film was in the can right on time. But he gave me free rein creatively and our director... brought in something memorable, and even Sam knew it.\"\n\nIn December 1964 Katzman announced he would make five films that year for MGM in his third year at the studio.\n\nKatzman made the Herman's Hermits film \"Hold On!\" (1966) and singer Roy Orbison's only film, \"The Fastest Guitar Alive\".\n\nIn 1967 he signed a new contract with MGM to make at least two films a year. These were \"Hot Rods to Hell\" (1967), the last film for John Brahm, and \"Riot on Sunset Strip\" (1967). Katzman wound up selling the latter to AIP for release.\n\nHis last films for MGM were \"A Time to Sing\" (1967) with Hank Williams, Jr. and \"The Young Runaways\" (1968).\n\nIn 1967 Columbia Pictures wanted two quick, topical films about love-ins and singles-only apartments. Sam Katzman got the call and recruited his 1940s cronies, Arthur Dreifuss and writer Hal Collins, to make \"The Love-Ins\" and \"For Singles Only\" (both 1967)\n\nKatzman's final films were produced by his son Jerry. These included \"Angel, Angel, Down We Go\" (1969) for AIP, \"How to Succeed with Sex\" (1970) and \"The Loners\" (1972) for Fanfare Productions.\n\nHe was the uncle of television producer Leonard Katzman, and, in turn, the great-great-uncle of Ethan Klein of the Israeli-American YouTube comedy channel h3h3Productions.\n\nHe was married to Hortense Katzman. They married on the set of the film \"The Diplomats\" in 1928.\n\nShe sued for divorce in 1955, but the two reconciled.\n\nSam Katzman died on August 4, 1973, in Hollywood. He is interred in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.\n\n\"NME\" – February 1962\n\nAs producer unless otherwise mentioned.\n\n\n"}

In 1874, Hudon — a cotton factory- moved in. Two years later, the North railway was extended through Hochelaga (the railway was renamed the Canadian Pacific in 1881) further catalyzing its industrial development and encouraging urbanization. In December 1883, Hochelaga was annexed to the city of Montreal against the demands of proprietors in Hochelaga. In response, they founded the village Maisonneuve and in only 15 years Maisonneuve became the 5th industrial slum of Canada. However, the area flourished. By 1918, however, the area was saddled with debt and aging factories and infrastructure. It was annexed to Montreal the same year.\n\nTwo years later, in 1920, many factories closed and moved east to Mercier. Mercier was an agglomeration of old villages: Beau-Rivage, Longue-Pointe and Tétreaultville. It was annexed to Montreal in 1910, before Maisonneuve. In 1960, the construction of the Autoroute 25 saw the demolition of many residential buildings in Mercier and divided it into two districts: Mercier-Ouest and Mercier-Est. Factories would continue to shut down well into the 1980s, leaving the borough ridden with poverty and a high concentration of welfare, especially in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. This has led to a population exodus, high crime rates and a general negative portrait of the area. It is, still today, often seen as the French ghetto of Montreal.\n\nThe 2010s have been marked by increased gentrification, leading to cases vandalism of new commerces.\n\nLocated in the east end of the Island of Montreal, it was part of the City of Montreal prior to the 2002 municipal mergers. It is composed of the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Mercier-Ouest and Mercier-Est areas. Each area has roughly the same population, but they differ in their commercial and social characteristics. The western region of the borough is composed of older districts while the Northern and Eastern regions have gone through a more recent urbanization. The borough is mainly composed of working class Québécois with a notable presence of Vietnamese immigrants in western regions and Italians as well as French immigrants to the North and East.\n\nThe largely oblong borough is bounded on the northwest by the borough of Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, on the north by Saint Leonard, on the northeast by Anjou, and on the east by Montréal-Est. To the south is the Saint Lawrence River.\n\nIt has an area of 24,60 km² and the evolution of industry and transportation has profoundly transformed the borough, The presence of large industrial zones (especially in Mercier-Ouest), Montreal's port and the area's importance as a transportation axis has determined the organization of the territory's area and its urban character.\n\nThere are 128,440 inhabitants: 46 085 in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve (36%), 41 011 in Mercier-Ouest (32%) and 41 344 in Mercier-Est (32%). ranking it amongst the five most populated boroughs in Montreal. The borough represents roughly 7.1% of Montreal's population.\n\nFor the first time in several decades the population in the borough stopped decreasing. Between 1996 and 2001 it grew roughly 2.3%. However this growth was mainly concentrated in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district (+8.2%) while Mercier-Est (+0.6%) grew very little and Mercier-Ouest (-2.0%) actually continued decreasing. It is worth noting that the population in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve decreased 48% between 1961 and 1996, so this population growth truly represents a revitalization in the region.\n\nThe urbanization of the three sectors differ, namely because of the varying population densities. Hochelaga-Maisonneuve has a density of 8 274 inhabitants per square kilometer. Mercier-Est has a lower density at 5 734 inhabitants per square kilometer. This density drops off quickly in Mercier-Ouest with 3 476 inhabitants mainly due to space being primarily industrial as opposed to huge residential zones in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and Mercier-Est.\n\n92.9% of the population speaks French at home, the highest of any region in Montreal, followed by English at 2.4% and Italian at 0.8%. The immigrant population represents 12.1% of the population, significantly under the Montreal average (27.6%). Most of the immigrants are concentrated in Mercier-Ouest (17%) while there are significantly lower levels of immigrants living in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve (9%) or Mercier-Est (10%). Many Italians are concentrated in the Louis-Rield district in the north end of Mercier-Ouest which is a natural extension of St. Leonard. However, Italians have also formed communal ghettos in Mercier-Est nestled around Sherbrooke street, especially near the San Domenico Savio Church. Between 1996 and 2001 there's been an increase in immigration to the area. There are currently 15 135 landed immigrants in the borough, mainly from Italy, Vietnam, Algeria and France.\n\nThe sectors also differ when it comes to age demographics. Hochelaga-Maisonneuve has the youngest age demographics, with a higher percentage of people aged 20 – 39 years. But the age distinction between districts is really noticeable with young adults aged 20–29 years. In recent years, there has been an arrival of young adults to the district, searching for cheap rent close to downtown. This has brought up disputes over the negative and positive effects of gentrification. However, for now, there is evidence that the new population is simply in co-habitation with previous tenants of the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district, taking up residents in renewed abandoned infrastructure. Condo projects, however, may lead to intense gentrification in the coming decade, although some claim these projects would have less impact than it did in the Plateau-Mont-Royal and Little Burgundy areas. Problems of gentrification seem to take little notice in Mercier-Ouest or Mercier-Est whose populations tend to be aging. The oldest population in the borough is located north of Sherbrooke in the Mercier-Ouest sector.\n\nThe borough is often cast in a negative light, mainly due to its economic planning and high poverty rate. However, it is often neglected to mention that the borough, despite a descriptive accent on its poverty, has large industrial zones and is commercially dynamic. It is often considered 'up and coming' with new revitalization plans for its residential zones.\n\nAccording to 'Recensement des établissements et de l'emploi à Montréal (REEM 2000)' there's been an increase of 95% in professional and technical jobs in the borough. However, this can be attributed to gentrification in the area, specifically in the Hochelaga district.\n\nThe average family income in Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is $49,804, considerably below the Montreal average ($62 409). The average individual makes $23,479. Nearly 32.9% of the borough's population is considered low-income, and there are patches of poverty scattered throughout the borough and heavily concentrated in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district.\n\nAs of the November 5, 2017 Montreal municipal election, the current borough council consists of the following councillors:\n\nThe borough is divided among the following federal ridings:\n\n\nIt is divided among the following provincial electoral districts:\n\n\nThe borough is bisected by Autoroute 25 and contains the Montreal entrance to the Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine Tunnel. It is served by the eastern end of the green line of the Montreal metro; the Honoré-Beaugrand and Radisson stations are connected to important bus termini.\n\nAttractions in the area include the Olympic Stadium, Saputo Stadium and Montreal Biodome, the Montreal Botanical Garden, the Château Dufresne, Collège de Maisonneuve, the Marché Maisonneuve, the Théâtre Denise-Pelletier, the Hôpital Louis-H.-La Fontaine, and the Place Versailles shopping centre.\n\nThe borough is home to the Church of Nativité-de-la-Sainte-Vierge-d'Hochelaga.\n\nThe \"Commission scolaire de Montréal\" (CSDM) operates French-language public schools.\n\nThe English Montreal School Board (EMSB) operates English-language schools.\n\nThe Montreal Public Libraries Network operates the Hochelaga, Langelier, Maisonneuve, and Mercier libraries.\n\n\nLa ville de Montreal, \"Arrondissement de Mercier-Hochelaga Maisonneuve: Plan strategic de developpement economique 2005-2008 (Plan D'action local pour l'economie et l'emploi)\" Le Groupe DBSF, Corporation de developpement de l'Est, May 2005\n\n"}

{"id": "1827491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827491", "title": "Leonard Katzman", "text": "Leonard Katzman\n\nLeonard Katzman (September 2, 1927 – September 5, 1996) was an American film and television producer, writer and director. He was most notable for being the showrunner (originally as producer, and later executive producer) of the CBS prime time soap opera \"Dallas\".\n\nLeonard Katzman was born in New York City on September 2, 1927, to a Jewish family. He began his career in the 1940s, while still in his teens, working as an assistant director for his uncle, Hollywood producer Sam Katzman. He started out on adventure movie serials such as \"Brenda Starr, Reporter\" (1945), \"Superman\" (1948), \"Batman and Robin\" (1949), \"The Great Adventures of Captain Kidd\" (1951), \"Riding with Buffalo Bill\" (1954), et al. During the 1950s he continued working as assistant director, mostly with his uncle, in feature films such as \"A Yank in Korea\" (1951), \"The Giant Claw\" (1957), \"Face of a Fugitive\" (1959) and \"Angel Baby\" (1961). Besides his big screen work, Katzman also served on television shows, including \"The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok\", \"\" and \"Bat Masterson\".\n\nIn 1960, Katzman made his production debut, serving not only as assistant director, but also as associate producer, on all four seasons of adventure drama \"Route 66\" (1960-1964), which he would later regard as his favorite production. His additional early work in television production (and occasional writing and directing) includes shows crime drama \"Tallahassee 7000\" (1961), western drama \"The Wild Wild West\" (1965-1969), the second season of crime drama \"Hawaii Five-O\" (1969-1970), legal drama \"Storefront Lawyers\" (1970-1971), the final five seasons of western drama \"Gunsmoke\" (1970-1975) as well as its spinoff series \"Dirty Sally\" (1974), legal drama \"Petrocelli\" (1974-1976) for which he was nominated an Edgar Allan Poe Award, and the two science fiction dramas \"The Fantastic Journey\" (1977) and \"Logan's Run\" (1977-1978). In 1965, he wrote, produced and directed the science fiction film \"Space Probe Taurus\" (also known as \"Space Monster\"). Aside from his work as assistant director, this was his only venture into feature films.\n\nIn 1978, Katzman served as producer for the five-part miniseries \"Dallas\", which would evolve into one of television's longest running dramas, lasting until 1991. While the series was created by David Jacobs, Katzman became the \"de facto\" show runner during the second season of the show, as Jacobs stepped down to create and later run \"Dallas\" spin-off series \"Knots Landing\". Under Katzman's lead, \"Dallas\", whose first episodes had consisted of self-contained stories, evolved into a serial, leading into the '80s trend of prime time soap operas.\n\nWhile Katzman headed \"Dallas\"' writing staff from the show's second season, he remained producer, with Philip Capice serving as executive producer. The creative conflicts between Capice and Katzman eventually led to Katzman stepping down from his production duties on the show for season nine, instead being billed as \"creative consultant\" (during this time he also worked on the short-lived drama series \"Our Family Honor\"). However, increased production costs and decreasing ratings caused production company Lorimar—along with series star Larry Hagman (J. R. Ewing)—to ask Katzman to return to the show in his old capacity. Katzman agreed, reportedly under the condition that he would have \"total authority\" on the show, and as of the tenth season premiere he was promoted to executive producer, and Capice was let go.\n\nKatzman remained as executive producer on \"Dallas\" until the series finale in May 1991. Besides his production work, he also wrote and directed more episodes of the series than anyone else.\n\nFollowing \"\"Dallas\"\", Katzman went on to create the short-lived crime drama \"Dangerous Curves\" (1992-1993), which aired as a part of CBS' late-night drama block Crimetime After Primetime, and serve as executive producer for the second season of the action drama \"Walker, Texas Ranger\" (1994-1995). His last work was the 1996 \"Dallas\" reunion movie \"\", which he also wrote and directed.\n\nLeonard Katzman and his wife, LaRue had three children. His daughter, actress Sherril Lynn Rettino (1956-1995), predeceased her father by one year. She played the recurring character Jackie Dugan on \"Dallas\" from 1979-91. His sons Mitchell Wayne Katzman and Frank Katzman, as well as son-in-law John Rettino, all worked on the production of \"Dallas\"' later seasons. Both sons were also involved in the production of \"Dangerous Curves\"; \"Walker, Texas Ranger\"; and \"J. R. Returns\".\n\nKatzman died of a heart attack in Malibu, California on September 5, 1996, three days after his 69th birthday, and more than two months prior to the airing of his last production, \"\". He was interred in the Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\nKatzman fathered a fourth child (his first born) Gary Katzman, with Eileen Leener (1929-2019), before meeting his wife. The child was eventually adopted and took the surname Klein. Through Gary, Katzman is the biological grandfather of Ethan Klein of the Israeli-American YouTube comedy channel h3h3Productions, who is Gary's son.\n\nExcluding work as assistant director.\n1997: Lone Star Film & Television Awards - Special Award\n"}

He has worked on numerous vehicle modification and repair projects. Many of these projects are unique in terms of the final results.\n\nThe types of vehicles David works on range from off-road four wheel drives to hot rod street trucks to around the woods all-terrain vehicles—or just about anything else that has an engine and some way to steer it.\n\nStacey David was born and raised in Idaho. He earned his reputation in the hot rod club driving a 1930 5 Window Coupe to school every day. David has had a fascination for motor vehicles for as long as he can remember.\n\nBy installing 440cc snowmobile engines, he was able to make his go-karts lightning fast even before he was a teenager. At the age of twelve, he did his first restoration: his sister's 1963 Volkswagen Beetle. His father's flat fender Willys Jeep started his passion for Four Wheel Drive and off-roading.\n\nDuring his college days at Boise State University, he spent the time that would have otherwise been spent in a \"boring\" Biology class learning how to race at the local tracks. While there, he absorbed everything he could about racing legends such as Richard Petty, Don Garlits, and Carroll Shelby.\nDavid's desire to own and drive a unique vehicle led him to the best way (in his opinion) to achieve this goal - to build it himself. To fulfill that goal, he became a student of legendary hot-rodders (custom car builders) George Barris, John Buttera and Darryl Starbird.\n\nWith those skills now in hand, David went to Nashville and opened his own custom car shop named \"Rattletrap.\" He continued to build his reputation by working on whatever was pushed, pulled, or dragged into his shop. The services that \"Rattletrap\" offered included engine building, custom paint, fabrication, and more.\n\nDavid's career took a turn to \"TV land\" when, in the late 1990s, he was offered a position to host the TV series \"Trucks!\". Eager to seize the opportunity, David joined Mel Fair to host the show beginning in its 1999 season. In 2000, however, Fair left the show and David remained the only host.\n\nDuring the eight years he hosted \"Trucks!\", the show became one of the highest rated on Spike TV's weekend lineup partially because David both designed and built his own projects, unlike many other shows during the same period. \"Trucks!\" maintained the highest viewership of any automotive how-to television show throughout the years David hosted it.\n\nDavid continued to host and produce the show until the end of the 2005 season, when he chose to pursue, in his own words, \"other opportunities\". On March 31, 2007—and a bit before that for his loyal fan base—the meaning of \"other opportunities\" was revealed as a new show called \"Stacey David’s GearZ\", airing on ESPN2.\n\nSeason two of \"GearZ\" moved to the Speed Channel, with the first episode premiering February 23, 2008. GearZ remained on SPEED channel for six seasons.\n\nSeason eight of \"GearZ\" moved to MavTV, with the first episode premiering March 7, 2014.

These include Saint-Henri, Little Burgundy, and Griffintown to the north of the canal, and Ville-Émard, Côte-Saint-Paul, and Pointe-Saint-Charles to the south.\n\nLocated southwest of downtown Montreal (hence the name), the borough is bordered to the northwest by Côte-des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, to the northeast by the Ville-Marie borough, to the south by the borough of Verdun, to the west by the borough of LaSalle and to the north by the city of Westmount. The Saint Lawrence River is located upon part of its eastern edge.\n\nOriginally devoted to agriculture, the various municipalities and districts of the Sud-Ouest underwent rapid industrialization following the opening of the Lachine Canal in 1825, becoming the cradle of Canadian industry thanks to both the transportation and the water power offered by the canal. The Canadian National Railway and Grand Trunk Railway also came through Saint-Henri and Pointe-Saint-Charles. The area became a stronghold of the working class, often in difficult conditions such as those described in Gabrielle Roy's \"The Tin Flute\", set in Saint-Henri.\nThe areas of the borough had highly specific identities. The western part of the borough - Saint-Henri, Ville-Émard, and Côte-Saint-Paul - were chiefly French Canadian, while Pointe-Saint-Charles and Griffintown were considered the seat of Irish culture in Montreal, with street names such as Hibernia and St. Patrick testifying to it. Starting in 1887, a large English-speaking Black community arose in Little Burgundy, attracted from the United States, other parts of Canada, and the Caribbean by jobs in the railways whose stations lay nearby; the area became famed for musical figures such as Oscar Peterson.\n\nThe city of Montreal annexed the town of Saint-Henri in 1905, Sainte-Cunégonde (Little Burgundy) in 1906, and Côte-Saint-Paul and Ville-Émard in 1910.\nHowever, with vessels constantly growing and finally exceeding the capacity of the canal, the coming of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1956 and the closure of the Lachine Canal in 1970 put an end to the area's industrial prosperity. Population fell sharply and conditions became still more difficult. Projects such as the Décarie Expressway, Turcot Interchange, Bonaventure Expressway, and Expo '67 destroyed entire neighbourhoods, such as Goose Village and part of Côte-Saint-Paul. However, community mobilization preserved the area's social fabric; in particular, the Pointe-Saint-Charles Community Clinic became the model for the CLSC system now used throughout the province.\n\nThe reorganization of Montreal in 2002 following the municipal mergers saw the creation of the borough council system, and accordingly, the creation of the borough of Le Sud-Ouest. The borough council met in several temporary locations, including the Marie Uguay cultural centre in Ville-Émard, before the inauguration of the current borough hall in a repurposed factory in Saint-Henri.\n\nToday, Le Sud-Ouest is undergoing an economic and social renaissance, stimulated by the reclamation of the canal for recreation in 2002; businesses opened up and numerous factories were converted into lofts and condominiums. This revival is bringing its own pressures, however, as gentrification increases property taxes and costs of living on the many low-income residents and puts pressure on the availability of low-income housing. The pending reconstruction of the Turcot Interchange and its impact on local residents is a major political issue in the borough.\n\nThe borough is divided into two districts:\n\n\nThe composition of the borough council remained unchanged following the 2017 municipal election, and consists of the following councillors:\n\nThe borough is divided among the following federal ridings:\n\n\nThe bulk of the borough constitutes the provincial electoral district of Saint-Henri–Sainte-Anne; the industrial and railway area in the northeast is in the district of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.\n\nLe Sud-Ouest has a visible minority population of 28%, smaller than that of the overall City of Montreal of 33%. The number of Visible minorities in the borough varies by neighborhood, averaging 22% in Ville-Émard/Côte-Saint-Paul, 30% in St-Henri, to 49% in Little Burgundy.\n\nThe borough is served by the green and orange lines of the Montreal Metro, including Place-Saint-Henri, Lionel-Groulx, Charlevoix, Angrignon, Georges-Vanier, Monk, and Jolicoeur stations.\n\nThe borough is traversed and partly delimited by Quebec Autoroutes 15 (Décarie Aut.) and 20 (Ville-Marie Aut.); Autoroute 10 (Bonaventure Aut.) also passes through it. The Montreal ends of the Champlain Bridge and Victoria Bridge lie in Le Sud-Ouest, as does the Turcot Interchange (autoroutes 15 and 20), Quebec's largest highway interchange. The CN rail lines exiting Central Station pass through the borough.\n\nMajor thoroughfares include Notre Dame St., Laurendeau St., St. Patrick St., La Vérendrye Blvd., De l'Église St., Monk Blvd., Centre St., Charlevoix St., Wellington St., Atwater Ave., and Guy St..\n\nThe Lachine Canal is crossed by the Boul. Monk, Rue Charlevoix, Rue des Seigneurs, and Rue Wellington bridges and by the Saint Rémi and Atwater tunnels.\n\nBicycle paths run along the Lachine Canal, through the Parc du Premier-Chemin-de-Fer and Rue Lionel-Groulx, and through Pointe-Saint-Charles. Pedestrian- and cyclist-only bridges across the canal are located at the Saint-Gabriel Locks, the Atwater Market, Gédéon de Catalogne Park (rue Beaudoin), and Rue de l'Église.\n\nThe two largest green spaces in the borough are the Lachine Canal and its recreational facilities (including the Lachine Canal National Historic Site of Canada), and Angrignon Park in Ville-Émard. Other important parks include Ignace Bourget Park (Ville-Émard), Sir George-Étienne Cartier Square and Saint-Henri Park (Saint-Henri), Vinet Park and Oscar Peterson Park (Little Burgundy), and Saint-Gabriel Park, Marguerite Bourgeoys Park, and Le Ber Park (Pointe-Saint-Charles).\n\nThe borough boasts numerous historic buildings, such as the Maison Saint-Gabriel (built in 1698), the former Negro Community Centre, the Atwater Market, Union United Church, Corona Theatre, the Atwater pumping station, the Saint-Henri fire hall, and the area's churches. In Saint-Henri, the Musée-des-Ondes Emile-Berliner tells the story of the radio and phonograph industry.\n\nThe borough's community centres include the Centre Saint-Zotique, the Centre d'éducation populaire (CEDA), Tyndale-St. George's Community Centre, Maison Saint-Charles, and Centre Monseigneur-Pigeon. It is served by four libraries: Marie-Uguay, Saint-Henri, Georges-Vanier, and Saint-Charles. Sporting facilities include the Complexe récréatif Gadbois, one of the largest on the island, as well as the Piscine Émard, Piscine Saint-Henri, Centre sportif de la Petite-Bourgogne, and Piscine Saint-Charles.\n\nThe territory of Le Sud-Ouest is served by the Centre de santé et des services sociaux du Sud-Ouest–Verdun, which operates the CLSCs Saint-Henri and Ville-Émard–Côte-Saint-Paul. The Clinique communautaire Pointe-Saint-Charles, though it inspired the CLSC system and is the provider of CLSC services for Pointe-Saint-Charles, continues to operate independently of the CLSC system. The nearest hospitals are the Hôpital de Verdun, Hôpital de LaSalle and the McGill University Health Centre superhospital is immediately northwest of the borough.\n\nMajor commercial streets include Boulevard Monk (Ville-Émard), Avenue de l'Église (Côte Saint-Paul), Rue du Centre (Pointe-Saint-Charles), and Rue Notre-Dame (Saint-Henri and Little Burgundy). Rue Notre-Dame in Little Burgundy is notable as a centre for antiques dealers.\n\nThe Atwater Market, is located beside the Lachine Canal. Joe Beef Restaurant is on Notre Dame Street West in Little Burgundy.\n\nThe \"Commission scolaire de Montréal\" (CSDM) operates Francophone public schools.\n\nThe English Montreal School Board (EMSB) operates Anglophone public schools.\n\nThe Montreal Public Libraries Network operates four libraries: Georges-Vanier, Marie-Uguay, Saint-Charles, and Saint-Henri.\n\nThe borough is home to the École de technologie supérieure technical university.\n\n\n"}

The borough includes the neighbourhoods of Villeray, Saint-Michel, and Parc-Extension.\n\nUntil the late Nineteenth century, the area that today comprises the borough of Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension was predominately rural and dotted with farms. The inauguration of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1878 and the arrival of electric streetcars in 1892 permitted the growth of Villeray. It was also in this era that the Italian immigrant community chose the neighbourhood as their preferred location.\n\nIn the early Twentieth century, Park Extension became industrialized, and a dozen quarries opened which led to the economic development of the area. Beginning in the 1940s, the exploitation of the Miron and Francon quarries attracted workers to Saint Michel and Park Extension.\n\nConstruction of the Metropolitan Expressway was completed in 1959. It cut the area in two, but also attracted multiple industries, which opened along the expressway. In less than twenty years, the population of Saint Michel increased from 6,000 to 68,000 inhabitants.\n\nJobs derived from competing industries along with the efficient transportation infrastructure resulted in strong demographic growth. The growth of the manufacturing sector, notably the textile industry, were incentives for new immigrants to settle in the borough.\n\nThe borough of Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension was created on January 1, 2002, following the municipal reorganization of Montreal. The borough includes three neighbourhoods that were part of Montreal before the reorganization:Villeray, Saint-Michel, and Park Extension. The Saint-Michel neighbourhood was formerly an independent city known as Saint-Michel-de-Laval which was annexed to Montreal in 1968. Villeray was once also an autonomous municipality but has been part of the city of Montreal since 1905. Parc Extension left the parish of St-Laurent to join the city of Montreal in 1910.\n\nLocated in north central Montreal, the pipe-shaped borough is bordered by Ahuntsic-Cartierville to the northwest, Montreal North to the northeast, Saint Leonard to the east, Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie to the southeast, Outremont to the southwest, and Mount Royal to the west.\n\nSaint-Michel is the easternmost neighbourhood of the borough, Park Extension is the westernmost neighbourhood and Villeray is in the centre.\n\nThe current borough mayor is Giuliana Fumagalli of Projet Montréal.\n\nThe borough is divided into four districts located in three different neighborhoods.

It is debated whether it is a separate language with heavy Latvian influence, due to historical mutual exposure, or a distinct Eastern dialect of Latvian. Nevertheless, its standardized form is recognized and protected as a \"historical variety of the Latvian language\" \"(vēsturisks latviešu valodas paveids)\" according to Latvian Language Law. The 2011 Latvian census established that 8.8% of Latvia's inhabitants, or 164,500 people, speak Latgalian daily. 97,600 of them live in Latgale, 29,400 in Riga and 14,400 in the Riga region.\n\nOriginally Latgalians were a tribe living in modern Vidzeme and Latgale. It is thought that they spoke the Latvian language, which later spread through the rest of modern Latvia, absorbing features of the Old Curonian, Semigallian, Selonian and Livonian languages. The Latgale area became politically separated during the Polish–Swedish wars, remaining part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as the Inflanty Voivodeship, while the rest of Latvians lived in lands dominated by Baltic German nobility. Both centuries of separate development and the influence of different prestige languages likely contributed to the development of modern Latgalian as distinct from the language spoken in Vidzeme and other parts of Latvia.\n\nThe modern Latgalian literary tradition started to develop in the 18th century from vernaculars spoken by Latvians in the eastern part of Latvia. The first surviving book published in Latgalian is \"Evangelia toto anno\" (\"Gospels for the whole year\") in 1753. The first systems of orthography were borrowed from Polish and used Antiqua letters. It was very different from the German-influenced orthography, usually written in Blackletter or Gothic script, used for the Latvian language in the rest of Latvia. Many Latgalian books in late 18th and early 19th century were authored by Jesuit priests, who came from various European countries to Latgale as the north-eastern outpost of the Roman Catholic religion; their writings included religious literature, calendars and poetry.\n\nPublishing books in the Latgalian language along with the Lithuanian was forbidden from 1865 to 1904. The ban on using Latin letters in this part of the Russian Empire followed immediately after the January Uprising, where Polish insurgents in Poland, and also in Lithuania and Latgale, challenged the czarist rule. During the ban, only a limited number of smuggled Catholic religious texts and some hand-written literature was available, e.g. calendars written by the self-educated peasant Andryvs Jūrdžys.\n\nAfter the repeal of the ban in 1904 there was a quick rebirth of the Latgalian literary tradition; first newspapers, textbooks and grammars appeared. In 1918 Latgale became part of the newly created Latvian state. From 1920 to 1934 the two literary traditions of Latvians developed in parallel. A notable achievement during this period was the original translation of the New Testament into Latgalian by the priest and scholar Aloizijs Broks, published in Aglona in 1933. After the coup staged by Kārlis Ulmanis in 1934, the subject of the Latgalian dialect was removed from the school curriculum and was invalidated for use in state institutions; this was as part of an effort to standardize Latvian language usage. Latgalian survived as a spoken language during the Soviet annexation of Latvia (1940–1991) while printed literature in Latgalian virtually ceased between 1959 and 1989. Some Latgalian intellectuals in emigration continued to publish books and studies of the Latgalian language, most notably Mikeļs Bukšs, see bibliography.\n\nSince the restoration of Latvian independence there has been a noticeable increase of interest in the Latgalian language and cultural heritage. It is taught as an optional subject in some universities; in Rēzekne the Publishing House of Latgalian Culture Centre (\"Latgales kultūras centra izdevniecība\") led by Jānis Elksnis, prints both old and new books in Latgalian.\n\nIn 1992, Juris Cibuļs together with Lidija Leikuma published one of the first Latgalian Alphabet books after the restoration of the language.\n\nIn the 21st century the Latgalian language has become more visible in Latvia's cultural life. Apart from its preservation movements, Latgalian can be more often heard in different interviews on the national TV channels, and there are modern rock groups such as Borowa MC and Dabasu Durovys singing in Latgalian who have had moderate success also throughout the country. Today, Latgalian is also found in written form in public signs, such as some street names and shop signs, evidences of growing use in the linguistic landscape.\n\nLatgalian is a member of the Eastern Baltic branch of the Baltic group of languages included in the family of Indo-European languages. The branch also includes Latvian, Samogitian and Lithuanian. Latgalian is a moderately inflected language; the number of verb and noun forms is characteristic of many other Baltic and Slavic languages (see Inflection in Baltic Languages).\n\nLatgalian is spoken by about 150,000 people, mainly in Latgale, Latvia; there are small Latgalian-speaking communities in Russia, Siberia.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1934 Latgalian was used in local government and education in Latgale. Now Latgalian is not used as an official language anywhere in Latvia. It is formally protected by the Latvian Language Law stating that \"The Latvian State ensures the preservation, protection and development of the Latgalian literary language as a historical variant of the Latvian language\" (§3.4). There is a state-supported orthography commission of the Latgalian language. Whether the Latgalian language is a separate language or a dialect of Latvian has been a matter of heated debate throughout the 20th century. Proponents of Latgalian such as linguists Antons Breidaks and Lidija Leikuma have suggested Latgalian has the characteristics of an independent language. Officially Latgalian is considered a variety of Latvian, meaning that Latvian language has two different written standards - Latvian and Latgalian.\n\nLatgalian speakers can be classified into three main groups – Northern, Central and Southern. These three groups of local accents are entirely mutually intelligible and characterized only by minor changes in vowels, diphthongs and some inflexion endings. The regional accents of central Latgale (such as those spoken in the towns and rural municipalities of Juosmuiža, Vuorkova, Vydsmuiža, Viļāni, Sakstygols, Ūzulaine, Makašāni, Drycāni, Gaigalova, Bierži, Tiļža and Nautrāni) form the phonetical basis of the modern standard Latgalian language. The literature of the 18th century was more influenced by the Southern accents of Latgalian.\n\nThe Latgalian language uses an alphabet with 35 letters. Its orthography is similar to Latvian orthography, but has two additional letters: represents ), an allophone of which is absent in standard Latvian. The letter survives from the pre-1957 Latvian orthography.\n\nTik skrytuļam ruodīs: iz vītys jis grīžās,<br>\nA brauciejam breinums, kai tuoli ceļš aizvess,<br>\nTai vuorpsteite cīši pret sprāduoju paušās,<br>\nJei naatteik – vacei gi dzejis gols zvaigznēs.\n\nPruots naguorbej ramu, juos lepneibu grūžoj,<br>\nVys jamās pa sovam ļauds pasauli puormeit,<br>\nBet nak jau sevkuram vīns kuorsynoj myužu<br>\nI ramaņu jumtus līk īguodu kuormim.\n\nNa vysim tai sadar kai kuošam ar speini,<br>\nSirds narymst i nabeidz par sātmalim tēmēt,<br>\nA pruots rauga skaitejs pa rokstaudža zeimem,<br>\nKai riedeits, kod saulei vēļ vaiņuku jēme.\n\nTāvs myusu, kas esi debesīs,<br>\nsvēteits lai tūp Tovs vōrds.<br>\nLai atnōk Tova vaļsteiba.<br>\nTova vaļa lai nūteik, kai debesīs,<br> \ntai ari vērs zemes.<br>\nMyusu ikdīneiškū maizi dūd mums šudiņ.<br>\nUn atlaid mums myusu porōdus,<br>\nkai ari mes atlaižam sovim porōdnīkim.<br>\nUn naīved myusu kārdynōšonā,<br> \nbet izglōb myusus nu ļauna Amen.\nNote the impact of foreign influences on Latvian (German in Kurzeme and Vidzeme, Polish, Lithuanian in Latgale).\n\n"}

Gionta began his NHL career in 2001 with the New Jersey Devils and has served as captain of the Montreal Canadiens and the Buffalo Sabres. He also was the captain for the United States in the 2018 Winter Olympics, for which he stepped away from the NHL for most of its 2017–18 season (NHL refused to release its players to the Olympics for the first time since 1994). After the Olympics, he briefly played for the Boston Bruins, and retired following their elimination from the playoffs.\n\nAs a youth, Gionta played in the 1993 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Rochester, New York.\n\nGionta was drafted 82nd overall by the New Jersey Devils in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. The diminutive but fiery forward attended high school at the Aquinas Institute in Rochester, New York, where in 1993–94 he was selected as their Rookie of the Year. He then skated for Boston College from 1997 to 2001, winning a national championship as Eagles captain in the 2000–01 season. He was mentored by former NHL forward Marty Reasoner, also a Rochester native, and enjoyed his best statistical season in his freshman year on a line with Reasoner, posting 30 goals and 62 points in 40 games as the Eagles fell to the University of Michigan in the national championship game in Boston.\n\nGionta followed up with a 60-point season his sophomore year as Boston College was eliminated by their Hockey East rival, the University of Maine, in the Frozen Four semi-finals. In his junior year, he posted a 33-goal, 56-point season as the Eagles fell to the University of North Dakota in that year's national championship game.\n\nIn his senior season as captain, Gionta's point total dipped again to 54 points. Nevertheless, a roster stocked with future NHL talent produced a national championship as Boston College defeated North Dakota 3–2 in overtime in Albany, New York. During his senior season, he led the nation in goal-scoring with 33 goals, including a performance against the University of Maine in which he scored on each of his first five shots.\n\nGionta, who joined the New Jersey Devils during the 2001–02 season, was a member of the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals-winning team that prevailed over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, he played for the Devils' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Albany River Rats. In 2006, he was a member of the 2006 United States' men's team that competed in Turin, Italy.\n\nLargely serving on the right wing of the Devils' prolific \"EGG\" line – which included Patrik Eliáš and Scott Gomez – Gionta was one of the Devils' most effective offensive players during his tenure in New Jersey. On March 28, 2006, Gionta became the first Devils player to score 40 goals in a season since Eliáš and Alexander Mogilny each reached the mark in the 2000–01 season.\n\nIn the last game of the 2005–06 season, Gionta broke Pat Verbeek's franchise record for goals in a season, finishing with 48. In that season, he also finished with his highest point total to date, with 89 in all 82 games of the regular season. On October 27, 2007, Gionta scored the first Devils' goal in the history of the Prudential Center in the second period of a 4–1 loss to Ottawa. (Chris Neil scored the first ever).\n\nGionta played 473 regular season games in total for New Jersey, in addition to 67 Stanley Cup Playoff games. , Gionta holds the franchise all-time power play goal-scoring record in one season, with 24.\n\nOn July 1, 2009, Gionta signed a five-year contract for $25 million with the Montreal Canadiens. It reunited him with former Devils teammate Scott Gomez.\n\nJust prior to his second season with the club, in 2010–11, on September 29, 2010, Gionta became only the second American-born player to serve as team captain of the Canadiens, after Chris Chelios.\n\nDuring the 2012–13 season, Gionta played in all 48 games of the lockout-shortened season and registered 14 goals and 12 assists while leading the Canadiens on a remarkable comeback from last in the Eastern Conference to their 23rd Northeast Division title. On March 5, 2013, Gionta scored the 20,000th NHL goal in the history of the Canadiens in a game against the New York Rangers. Entering the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs as the second seed against the Ottawa Senators, Gionta tore his bicep in Game 1 and was forced to undergo season-ending surgery to repair it.\n\nOn July 1, 2014, Gionta signed a three-year free-agent deal with hometown team, the Buffalo Sabres, for $4.25 million per year. On October 7, 2014, Gionta was named captain of the Sabres. Gionta played in his 1,000th NHL game on March 27, 2017 against the Florida Panthers in Buffalo.\n\nOn February 25, 2018, Gionta signed a one-year, $700,000 contract for the remainder of the season with the Boston Bruins.\n\nGionta announced his retirement on September 24, 2018, and revealed that he had joined the Sabres as a development coach.\n\nThe Sabres opted not to re-sign Gionta in the 2017 offseason after reacquiring Jason Pominville in a trade. The Sabres' owned-and-operated American Hockey League club, the Rochester Americans, signed Gionta to their practice squad on October 9, 2017. Since the practice-only contract is not with the NHL, Gionta was able to participate in the Winter Olympics, following the NHL's announcement not to accommodate an Olympic break due to financial disputes with the IOC. Gionta was officially named to Team USA's pre-Olympic roster on October 18, 2017. Gionta has since been named USA team captain. Gionta admitted turning down NHL offers to participate in the Olympics and intends to re-sign with the league after the Olympics end.\n\nOn January 29, 2018, the Americans upgraded Gionta's practice-squad contract to a one-game professional tryout contract, allowing him to play the Americans February 2, 2018 game against the Toronto Marlies before leaving for the Olympics. Gionta scored a goal in the game but the Americans lost 4-2.\n\nGionta is the middle child of Sam and Penny Gionta. He and his wife, Harvest, have three children. Gionta has a brother, Stephen, who plays for the New York Islanders. He also has an older brother Joe, who also played for the Aquinas Institute Hockey Team and graduated in 1994. Brian Gionta has a home in the Rochester, New York area where his parents still reside.\n\n\n1: Michael Cammalleri had previously scored the 20,000th goal in Canadiens' franchise history in 2009.

He was promoted to the rank of general, and served as one of the leading European officers in the Punjab Army\n\nCourt was born at Saint-Cézaire-sur-Siagne, France, on 24 September 1793. He was educated at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris.\n\nIn 1813, he joined the French army. After Napoleon's defeat in the Waterloo in 1815 he was dismissed from service. He left France in 1818 for Baghdad and joined the Persian forces which were trained at Kermanshah by a handful of ex-officers of Napoleon's army including Jean-Baptiste Ventura. While in Persia, he met Paolo Avitabile, another Neapolitan adventurer, and together they travelled on to Lahore reaching there in early 1827.\n\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh gave Court employment in the artillery befitting his talents and scientific attainments. Court was responsible for the training of artillerymen, the organization of batteries and the establishment of arsenals and magazines on European lines. The Maharaja had his own foundries for casting guns and for the manufacture of shells. Court supervised these in collaboration with Sardar Lahina Singh Majithia.\n\nWhen Court produced the first shell at the Lahore foundry, the Maharaja bestowed upon him a prize of Rs 30,000, and when he produced the fuse, he was rewarded with an award of Rs 5,000. Court received a salary of Rs 2,500 per month, besides a jagir.\n\nHe took part in the expedition of Peshawar (1834) and the battle of Jamrud (1837).\nHe was promoted to general in 1836.\n\nClaude Auguste Court continued to serve the State after the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.\nAfter the death of Kanvar Nau Nihal Singh on 5 November 1840, Court along with Ventura sided with Sher Singh who was installed as Maharaja, with their help in investing the Fort of Lahore, on 20 January 1841.\n\nAfter Maharaja Sher Singh's assassination in September 1843, he fled to Firozpur, in British territory, and, ultimately securing his discharge from the Sikh army, proceeded with his Punjabi wife and the children to France in 1844. He purchased an estate in the countryside and a residence in the city of Paris where he lived until his death in 1880. A very useful overview of Court's life in India is found in Jean-Marie Lafont's book \"Indika: Essays in Indo-French Relations, 1630-1976 \"[New Delhi, 2000]. Lafont presents an enormous amount of new information of the 'French Generals\" serving in Lahore in the 1820s-30s as well as the intellectual interest France showed in all things Indian in the 19th century.\n\nCourt was one of the first Europeans to become interested in the coins of South Asia, which he collected from 1829. Part of the collection was described in \"Revue Numismatique\" in 1839 and Court talks of his coin collection in his valuable \"Memoires\" published in Paris in 1856-57. Court died in Paris in January 1880 leaving his heirs his rich coin collection. We know almost nothing of its fate since then until three albums came to light in an English book sale. They contained 627 coin rubbings, allowing many of Court's coins to be identified. These had been bought by a coin collector, Alexander Cunningham, whose collection was acquired by the British Museum in 1888–94. Cunningham may also have owned the albums.\n\n"}

It borders Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) to the south and Central Denmark Region to the north and is connected to Region Zealand via the Great Belt Fixed Link.\n\nThe regional capital is Vejle but Odense is the region's largest city and home to the main campus of the University of Southern Denmark with branch campuses in Esbjerg, Kolding and Sønderborg.\nThe responsibilities of the regional administration include hospitals and regional public transport, which is divided between two operators, Sydtrafik on the mainland and Als, and Fynbus on Funen and adjacent islands. On the island municipalities of Ærø (since 2016) and Fanø (since 2018), the municipalities themselves are responsible for public transport.\n\nThe Region of Southern Denmark is the westernmost of the Danish administrative regions (Region Zealand being the southernmost).\n\nIt consists of the former counties of Funen, Ribe and South Jutland, adding ten municipalities from the former Vejle County. The territories formerly belonging to Vejle County consist of the new municipalities of Fredericia (unchanged by the reform), Vejle (a merger of Vejle, Børkop, parts of Egtved, Give, and Jelling) and Kolding (a merger of Kolding, parts of Lunderskov, Vamdrup, and parts of both Egtved and Christiansfeld - the latter from South Jutland County). A total of 78 municipalities were combined to a total of 22 new entities.\n\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 57.3 billion € in 2018, accounting for 19.0% of Denmarks economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 35,100 € or 116% of the EU27 average in the same year.\n\nThe Region of Southern Denmark is home to the only officially recognised ethno-linguistic minority of Denmark proper, the North Schleswig Germans of North Schleswig. This minority makes up about 6% of the total population of the municipalities of Aabenraa/Apenrade, Haderslev/Hadersleben, Sønderborg/Sonderburg and Tønder/Tondern. In these four municipalities, the German minority enjoys certain linguistic rights in accordance with the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.\n"}

Its population was 5,791 as of the 2010 census.\n\nTellico Village is a planned community. Governmental functions are managed by the Tellico Village Property Owners Association.\n\nTellico Village exists because of the actions of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which decided to dam up the Little Tennessee River at its confluence with the Tennessee River. Tellico Dam was completed in November 1979 after a long battle, which involved the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and a fish called the snail darter. As part of the project, the TVA acquired additional land above the high water line of the reservoir (Tellico Lake), much of it taken by eminent domain. Part of this additional land was later sold to Cooper Communities, Inc., which established Tellico Village in 1986.\n\nThe community has three golf courses and a yacht and country club. The names of the golf courses, like the names of the streets and neighborhoods (each neighborhood within Tellico Village has its own name) are derived from American Indian words and names, mostly Cherokee. These include \"Toqua\", meaning \"fish,\" and \"Tanasi\", which was the name of a town that was the capital of the Cherokee Nation between 1721 and 1730. \"Tanasi\" is also the word from which the name \"Tennessee\" was derived.\n\nThe postal addresses for the community are Loudon (37774) and Vonore (37885), Tennessee.\n\nTellico Village did have a branch post office through a More Than Mail! store but the store's Postal service contract was terminated in November 2013. It operated for 15 years.\n\nTellico Village has a Food Lion grocery store and a pharmacy, Preferred Pharmacy. For other shopping residents drive to Loudon, Lenoir City or Vonore.\n\n"}

{"id": "1827600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827600", "title": "Environmental history", "text": "Environmental history\n\nEnvironmental history is the study of human interaction with the natural world over time, emphasising the active role nature plays in influencing human affairs and vice versa.\n\nEnvironmental history emerged in the United States out of the environmental movement of the 1960s and 1970s, and much of its impetus still stems from present-day global environmental concerns. The field was founded on conservation issues but has broadened in scope to include more general social and scientific history and may deal with cities, population or sustainable development. As all history occurs in the natural world, environmental history tends to focus on particular time-scales, geographic regions, or key themes. It is also a strongly multidisciplinary subject that draws widely on both the humanities and natural science.\n\nThe subject matter of environmental history can be divided into three main components. The first, nature itself and its change over time, includes the physical impact of humans on the Earth's land, water, atmosphere and biosphere. The second category, how humans use nature, includes the environmental consequences of increasing population, more effective technology and changing patterns of production and consumption. Other key themes are the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer communities to settled agriculture in the neolithic revolution, the effects of colonial expansion and settlements, and the environmental and human consequences of the industrial and technological revolutions. Finally, environmental historians study how people think about nature - the way attitudes, beliefs and values influence interaction with nature, especially in the form of myths, religion and science.\n\nIn 1967 Roderick Nash published \"\"Wilderness and the American Mind\"\", a work that has become a classic text of early environmental history. In an address to the \"Organization of American Historians\" in 1969 (published in 1970) Nash used the expression \"environmental history\", although 1972 is generally taken as the date when the term was first coined. The 1959 book by Samuel P. Hays, \"Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement, 1890-1920\", while being a major contribution to American political history, is now also regarded as a founding document in the field of environmental history. Hays is Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Pittsburgh. Alfred W. Crosby's book \"The Columbian Exchange\" (1972) is another key early work of environmental history.\n\nBrief overviews of the historiography of environmental history have been published by J. R. McNeill, Richard White, and J. Donald Hughes. In 2014 Oxford University Press published a volume of 25 essays in \"The Oxford Handbook of Environmental History\".\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of environmental history. In general terms it is a history that tries to explain why our environment is like it is and how humanity has influenced its current condition, as well as commenting on the problems and opportunities of tomorrow. Donald Worster's widely quoted 1988 definition states that environmental history is the \"interaction between human cultures and the environment in the past\".\n\nIn 2001, J. Donald Hughes defined the subject as the “study of human relationships through time with the natural communities of which they are a part in order to explain the processes of change that affect that relationship”. and, in 2006, as \"history that seeks understanding of human beings as they have lived, worked and thought in relationship to the rest of nature through the changes brought by time\". \"As a method, environmental history is the use of ecological analysis as a means of understanding human history...an account of changes in human societies as they relate to changes in the natural environment”. Environmental historians are also interested in \"what people think about nature, and how they have expressed those ideas in folk religions, popular culture, literature and art”. In 2003, J. R. McNeill defined it as \"the history of the mutual relations between humankind and the rest of nature\".\n\nTraditional historical analysis has over time extended its range of study from the activities and influence of a few significant people to a much broader social, political, economic, and cultural analysis. Environmental history further broadens the subject matter of conventional history. In 1988, Donald Worster stated that environmental history “attempts to make history more inclusive in its narratives” by examining the “\"role and place of nature in human life\"”, and in 1993, that “Environmental history explores the ways in which the biophysical world has influenced the course of human history and the ways in which people have thought about and tried to transform their surroundings\"”. The interdependency of human and environmental factors in the creation of landscapes is expressed through the notion of the cultural landscape. Worster also questioned the scope of the discipline, asking: \"\"We study humans and nature; therefore can anything human or natural be outside our enquiry?\"\"\n\nEnvironmental history is generally treated as a subfield of history. But some environmental historians challenge this assumption, arguing that while traditional history is human history – the story of people and their institutions, \"humans cannot place themselves outside the principles of nature\". In this sense, they argue that environmental history is a version of human history within a larger context, one less dependent on anthropocentrism (even though anthropogenic change is at the center of its narrative).\n\nJ. Donald Hughes responded to the view that environmental history is \"\"light on theory\"\" or lacking theoretical structure by viewing the subject through the lens of three \"dimensions\": nature and culture, history and science, and scale. This advances beyond Worster's recognition of three broad clusters of issues to be addressed by environmental historians although both historians recognize that the emphasis of their categories might vary according to the particular study as, clearly, some studies will concentrate more on society and human affairs and others more on the environment.\n\nSeveral themes are used to express these historical dimensions. A more traditional historical approach is to analyse the transformation of the globe's ecology through themes like the separation of man from nature during the neolithic revolution, imperialism and colonial expansion, exploration, agricultural change, the effects of the industrial and technological revolution, and urban expansion. More environmental topics include human impact through influences on forestry, fire, climate change, sustainability and so on. According to Paul Warde, “\"the increasingly sophisticated history of colonization and migration can take on an environmental aspect, tracing the pathways of ideas and species around the globe and indeed is bringing about an increased use of such analogies and ‘colonial’ understandings of processes within European history.\"” The importance of the colonial enterprise in Africa, the Caribbean and Indian Ocean has been detailed by Richard Grove. \nMuch of the literature consists of case-studies targeted at the global, national and local levels.\n\nAlthough environmental history can cover billions of years of history over the whole Earth, it can equally concern itself with local scales and brief time periods. Many environmental historians are occupied with local, regional and national histories. Some historians link their subject exclusively to the span of human history – \"\"every time period in human history\"\" while others include the period before human presence on Earth as a legitimate part of the discipline. Ian Simmons's \"Environmental History of Great Britain\" covers a period of about 10,000 years. There is a tendency to difference in time scales between natural and social phenomena: the causes of environmental change that stretch back in time may be dealt with socially over a comparatively brief period.\n\nAlthough at all times environmental influences have extended beyond particular geographic regions and cultures, during the 20th and early 21st centuries anthropogenic environmental change has assumed global proportions, most prominently with climate change but also as a result of settlement, the spread of disease and the globalization of world trade.\n\nThe questions of environmental history date back to antiquity, including Hippocrates, the father of medicine, who asserted that different cultures and human temperaments could be related to the surroundings in which peoples lived in \"Airs, Waters, Places\". Scholars as varied as Ibn Khaldun and Montesquieu found climate to be a key determinant of human behavior. During the Enlightenment, there was a rising awareness of the environment and scientists addressed themes of sustainability via natural history and medicine. However, the origins of the subject in its present form are generally traced to the 20th century.\n\nIn 1929 a group of French historians founded the journal \"Annales\", in many ways a forerunner of modern environmental history since it took as its subject matter the reciprocal global influences of the environment and human society. The idea of the impact of the physical environment on civilizations was espoused by this Annales School to describe the long term developments that shape human history by focusing away from political and intellectual history, toward agriculture, demography, and geography. Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, a pupil of the Annales School, was the first to really embrace, in the 1950s, environmental history in a more contemporary form. One of the most influential members of the Annales School was Lucien Febvre (1878–1956), whose book \"A Geographical Introduction to History\" is now a classic in the field.\n\nThe most influential empirical and theoretical work in the subject has been done in the United States where teaching programs first emerged and a generation of trained environmental historians is now active. In the United States environmental history as an independent field of study emerged in the general cultural reassessment and reform of the 1960s and 1970s along with environmentalism, \"conservation history\", and a gathering awareness of the global scale of some environmental issues. This was in large part a reaction to the way nature was represented in history at the time, which “portrayed the advance of culture and technology as releasing humans from dependence on the natural world and providing them with the means to manage it [and] celebrated human mastery over other forms of life and the natural environment, and expected technological improvement and economic growth to accelerate”. Environmental historians intended to develop a post-colonial historiography that was \"\"more inclusive in its narratives\"\".\n\nMoral and political inspiration to environmental historians has come from American writers and activists such as Henry Thoreau, John Muir, Aldo Leopold, and Rachel Carson. Environmental history \"frequently promoted a moral and political agenda although it steadily became a more scholarly enterprise\". Early attempts to define the field were made in the United States by Roderick Nash in “The State of Environmental History” and in other works by frontier historians Frederick Jackson Turner, James Malin, and Walter Prescott Webb, who analyzed the process of settlement. Their work was expanded by a second generation of more specialized environmental historians such as Alfred Crosby, Samuel P. Hays, Donald Worster, William Cronon, Richard White, Carolyn Merchant, J. R. McNeill, Donald Hughes, and Chad Montrie in the United States and Paul Warde, Sverker Sorlin, Robert A. Lambert, T.C. Smout, and Peter Coates in Europe.\n\nAlthough environmental history was growing rapidly as a field after 1970 in the United States, it only reached historians of the British Empire in the 1990s. Gregory Barton argues that the concept of environmentalism emerged from forestry studies, and emphasizes the British imperial role in that research. He argues that imperial forestry movement in India around 1900 included government reservations, new methods of fire protection, and attention to revenue-producing forest management. The result eased the fight between romantic preservationists and laissez-faire businessmen, thus giving the compromise from which modern environmentalism emerged.\n\nIn recent years numerous scholars cited by James Beattie have examined the environmental impact of the Empire. Beinart and Hughes argue that the discovery and commercial or scientific use of new plants was an important concern in the 18th and 19th centuries. The efficient use of rivers through dams and irrigation projects was an expensive but important method of raising agricultural productivity. Searching for more efficient ways of using natural resources, the British moved flora, fauna and commodities around the world, sometimes resulting in ecological disruption and radical environmental change. Imperialism also stimulated more modern attitudes toward nature and subsidized botany and agricultural research. Scholars have used the British Empire to examine the utility of the new concept of eco-cultural networks as a lens for examining interconnected, wide-ranging social and environmental processes.\n\nIn the United States the American Society for Environmental History was founded in 1975 while the first institute devoted specifically to environmental history in Europe was established in 1991, based at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. In 1986, the Dutch foundation for the history of environment and hygiene \"Net Werk\" was founded and publishes four newsletters per year. In the UK the White Horse Press in Cambridge has, since 1995, published the journal \"Environment and History\" which aims to bring scholars in the humanities and biological sciences closer together in constructing long and well-founded perspectives on present day environmental problems and a similar publication \"Tijdschrift voor Ecologische Geschiedenis\" (\"Journal for Environmental History\") is a combined Flemish-Dutch initiative mainly dealing with topics in the Netherlands and Belgium although it also has an interest in European environmental history. Each issue contains abstracts in English, French and German. In 1999 the Journal was converted into a yearbook for environmental history. In Canada the Network in Canadian History and Environment facilitates the growth of environmental history through numerous workshops and a significant digital infrastructure including their website and podcast.\n\nCommunication between European nations is restricted by language difficulties. In April 1999 a meeting was held in Germany to overcome these problems and to co-ordinate environmental history in Europe. This meeting resulted in the creation of the European Society for Environmental History in 1999. Only two years after its establishment, ESEH held its first international conference in St. Andrews, Scotland. Around 120 scholars attended the meeting and 105 papers were presented on topics covering the whole spectrum of environmental history. The conference showed that environmental history is a viable and lively field in Europe and since then ESEH has expanded to over 400 members and continues to grow and attracted international conferences in 2003 and 2005. In 1999 the \"Centre for Environmental History\" was established at the University of Stirling. Some history departments at European universities are now offering introductory courses in environmental history and postgraduate courses in Environmental history have been established at the Universities of Nottingham, Stirling and Dundee and more recently a Graduierten Kolleg was created at the University of Göttingen in Germany. In 2009, the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society (RCC), an international, interdisciplinary center for research and education in the environmental humanities and social sciences, was founded as a joint initiative of Munich's Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität and the Deutsches Museum, with the generous support of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The Environment & Society Portal (environmentandsociety.org) is the Rachel Carson Center's open access digital archive and publication platform. \nEnvironmental history prides itself in bridging the gap between the arts and natural sciences although to date the scales weigh on the side of science. A definitive list of related subjects would be lengthy indeed and singling out those for special mention a difficult task. However, those frequently quoted include, historical geography, the history and philosophy of science, history of technology and climate science. On the biological side there is, above all, ecology and historical ecology, but also forestry and especially forest history, archaeology and anthropology. When the subject engages in environmental advocacy it has much in common with environmentalism.\n\nWith increasing globalization and the impact of global trade on resource distribution, concern over never-ending economic growth and the many human inequities environmental history is now gaining allies in the fields of ecological and environmental economics.\n\nEngagement with sociological thinkers and the humanities is limited but cannot be ignored through the beliefs and ideas that guide human action. This has been seen as the reason for a perceived lack of support from traditional historians.\n\nThe subject has a number of areas of lively debate. These include discussion concerning: what subject matter is most appropriate; whether environmental advocacy can detract from scholarly objectivity; standards of professionalism in a subject where much outstanding work has been done by non-historians; the relative contribution of nature and humans in determining the passage of history; the degree of connection with, and acceptance by, other disciplines - but especially mainstream history. For Paul Warde the sheer scale, scope and diffuseness of the environmental history endeavour calls for an analytical toolkit \"a range of common issues and questions to push forward collectively\" and a \"core problem\". He sees a lack of \"human agency\" in its texts and suggest it be written more to act: as of information for environmental scientists; incorporation of the notion of risk; a closer analysis of what it is we mean by \"environment\"; confronting the way environmental history is at odds with the humanities because it emphasises the division between \"materialist, and cultural or constructivist explanations for human behaviour\".\n\nMany of the themes of environmental history inevitably examine the circumstances that produced the environmental problems of the present day, a litany of themes that challenge global sustainability including: population, consumerism and materialism, climate change, waste disposal, deforestation and loss of wilderness, industrial agriculture, species extinction, depletion of natural resources, invasive organisms and urban development. The simple message of sustainable use of renewable resources is frequently repeated and early as 1864 George Perkins Marsh was pointing out that the changes we make in the environment may later reduce the environments usefulness to humans so any changes should be made with great care - what we would nowadays call enlightened self-interest. Richard Grove has pointed out that \"\"States will act to prevent environmental degradation only when their economic interests are threatened\"\".\n\nIt is not clear whether environmental history should promote a moral or political agenda. The strong emotions raised by environmentalism, conservation and sustainability can interfere with historical objectivity: polemical tracts and strong advocacy can compromise objectivity and professionalism. Engagement with the political process certainly has its academic perils although accuracy and commitment to the historical method is not necessarily threatened by environmental involvement: environmental historians have a reasonable expectation that their work will inform policy-makers.\n\nA recent historiographical shift has placed an increased emphasis on inequality as an element of environmental history. Imbalances of power in resources, industry, and politics have resulted in the burden of industrial pollution being shifted to less powerful populations in both the geographic and social spheres. An critical examination of the traditional environmentalist movement from this historical perspective notes the ways in which early advocates of environmentalism sought the aesthetic preservation of middle-class spaces and sheltered their own communities from the worst effects of air and water pollution, while neglecting the plight of the less privileged.\n\nCommunities with less economic and sociopolitical power often lack the resources to get involved in environmental advocacy. Environmental history increasingly highlights the ways in which the middle-class environmental movement has fallen short and left behind entire communities. Interdisciplinary research now understands historic inequality as a lens through which to predict future social developments in the environmental sphere, particularly with regard to climate change. The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs cautions that a warming planet will exacerbate environmental and other inequalities, particularly with regard to: \"(a) increase in the exposure of the disadvantaged groups to the adverse effects of climate change; (b) increase in their susceptibility to damage caused by climate change; and (c) decrease in their ability to cope and recover from the damage suffered.\" As an interdisciplinary field that encompasses a new understanding of social justice dynamics in a rapidly changing global climate, environmental history is inherently advocative.\n\nNarratives of environmental history tend to be what scholars call \"declensionist,\" that is, accounts of increasing decline under human activity.\n\nUnder the accusation of \"presentism\" it is sometimes claimed that, with its genesis in the late 20th century environmentalism and conservation issues, environmental history is simply a reaction to contemporary problems, an \"attempt to read late twentieth century developments and concerns back into past historical periods in which they were not operative, and certainly not conscious to human participants during those times\". This is strongly related to the idea of culpability. In environmental debate blame can always be apportioned, but it is more constructive for the future to understand the values and imperatives of the period under discussion so that causes are determined and the context explained.\n\nFor some environmental historians \"the general conditions of the environment, the scale and arrangement of land and sea, the availability of resources, and the presence or absence of animals available for domestication, and associated organisms and disease vectors, that makes the development of human cultures possible and even predispose the direction of their development\" and that \"history is inevitably guided by forces that are not of human origin or subject to human choice\". This approach has been attributed to American environmental historians Webb and Turner and, more recently to Jared Diamond in his book \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\", where the presence or absence of disease vectors and resources such as plants and animals that are amenable to domestication that may not only stimulate the development of human culture but even determine, to some extent, the direction of that development. The claim that the path of history has been forged by environmental rather than cultural forces is referred to as environmental determinism while, at the other extreme, is what may be called cultural determinism. An example of cultural determinism would be the view that human influence is so pervasive that the idea of pristine nature has little validity - that there is no way of relating to nature without culture.\n\nUseful guidance on the process of doing environmental history has been given by Donald Worster, Carolyn Merchant, William Cronon and Ian Simmons. Worster's three core subject areas (the environment itself, human impacts on the environment, and human thought about the environment) are generally taken as a starting point for the student as they encompass many of the different skills required. The tools are those of both history and science with a requirement for fluency in the language of natural science and especially ecology. In fact methodologies and insights from a range of physical and social sciences is required, there seeming to be universal agreement that environmental history is indeed a multidisciplinary subject.\n\n\nIn 2004 a theme issue of \"Environment and History 10(4)\" provided an overview of environmental history as practiced in Africa, the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, China and Europe as well as those with global scope. J. Donald Hughes (2006) has also provided a global conspectus of major contributions to the environmental history literature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental history, like all historical studies, shares the hope that through an examination of past events it may be possible to forge a more considered future. In particular a greater depth of historical knowledge can inform environmental controversies and guide policy decisions.\n\nThe subject continues to provide new perspectives, offering cooperation between scholars with different disciplinary backgrounds and providing an improved historical context to resource and environmental problems. There seems little doubt that, with increasing concern for our environmental future, environmental history will continue along the path of environmental advocacy from which it originated as “\"human impact on the living systems of the planet bring us no closer to utopia, but instead to a crisis of survival\"” with key themes being population growth, climate change, conflict over environmental policy at different levels of human organization, extinction, biological invasions, the environmental consequences of technology especially biotechnology, the reduced supply of resources - most notably energy, materials and water. Hughes comments that environmental historians “\"will find themselves increasingly challenged by the need to explain the background of the world market economy and its effects on the global environment. Supranational instrumentalities threaten to overpower conservation in a drive for what is called sustainable development, but which in fact envisions no limits to economic growth\"”. Hughes also notes that \"\"environmental history is notably absent from nations that most adamantly reject US, or Western influences\"\".\n\nMichael Bess sees the world increasingly permeated by potent technologies in a process he calls “artificialization” which has been accelerating since the 1700s, but at a greatly accelerated rate after 1945. Over the next fifty years, this transformative process stands a good chance of turning our physical world, and our society, upside-down. Environmental historians can “\"play a vital role in helping humankind to understand the gale-force of artifice that we have unleashed on our planet and on ourselves\"”.\n\nAgainst this background “\"environmental history can give an essential perspective, offering knowledge of the historical process that led to the present situation, give examples of past problems and solutions, and an analysis of the historical forces that must be dealt with\"” or, as expressed by William Cronon, \"\"The viability and success of new human modes of existing within the constraints of the environment and its resources requires both an understanding of the past and an articulation of a new ethic for the future\".\"\n\nKey journals in this field include: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1827606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827606", "title": "Master argument", "text": "Master argument\n\nThe master argument is George Berkeley's argument that mind-independent objects do not exist because it is impossible to conceive of them. The argument is against intuition and has been widely challenged. The term \"Berkeley's master argument\" was introduced by Andre Gallois in 1974. His term has firmly become currency of contemporary Berkeley scholarship.\n\nIn order to determine whether it is possible for a tree to exist outside of the mind, we need to be able to think of an unconceived tree. But as soon as we try to think about this tree, we have conceived it. So we have failed and there is no good reason to believe that trees exist outside of the mind.\n\nThe Master Argument has been seen by several prominent philosophers as having a crucial mistake; see criticisms of idealism. However, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact mistake Berkeley makes. Bertrand Russell among others believed the problem is Berkeley fails to differentiate between the act of perception and the content of it:\n\n\"If we say that the things known must be in the mind, we are either un-duly limiting the mind's power of knowing, or we are uttering a mere tautology. We are uttering a mere tautology if we mean by 'in the mind' the same as by 'before the mind', i.e. if we mean merely being apprehended by the mind. But if we mean this, we shall have to admit that what, in this sense, is in the mind, may nevertheless be not mental. Thus when we realize the nature of knowledge, Berkeley's argument is seen to be wrong in substance as well as in form, and his grounds for supposing that 'idea'-i.e. the objects apprehended-must be mental, are found to have no validity whatever. Hence his grounds in favour of the idealism may be dismissed.\" \n\nSome claim that Berkeley was not making a Master Argument at all and that what he was actually trying to show was that the substance 'matter' was actually an abstract concept that passed itself off in peoples' minds as an object of immediate experience. Rather than say that the matter cannot exist, the critics claim, Berkeley is saying that it can only exist as an abstract concept and that this abstract concept was conceptually useless.\n\n"}

She began playing the guitar at the age of seven. She also played drums in local fife-and-drum bands, beginning with the band led by her paternal grandfather, Sid Hemphill, in which she played snare drum and bass drum. Aside from sitting in at Memphis bars a few times in the 1950s, most of her playing was done in family and informal settings, such as picnics with fife-and-drum music, until she was recorded in 1979.\n\nHer first recordings were field recordings made by the blues researcher George Mitchell in 1967 and the ethnomusicologist David Evans in 1973, but they were not released. She was then known as Jessie Mae Brooks, using the surname from a brief early marriage. \n\nIn 1978, Evans came to Memphis, Tennessee, to teach at Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis). The school founded the High Water Recording Company in 1979 to promote interest in the regional music of the South. Evans made the first high-quality field recordings of Hemphill in that year and soon after produced her first sessions for High Water.\n\nHemphill launched a recording career in the early 1980s. In 1981 her first full-length album, \"She-Wolf\", was licensed from High Water and released by the French label Disques Vogue. In the early 1980s, she performed in a Mississippi drum corps assembled by Evans; it included Hemphill, Abe Young, and Jim Harper (who also played on Tav Falco's Panther Burns's album \"Behind the Magnolia Curtain\"). Hemphill performed in another drum group with Young and fife-and-drum band veteran Othar Turner for the television program \"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood\". The French label Black & Blue Records released other recordings by her. Hemphill played concerts across the United States and in other countries, including France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and Canada. In 1987 and 1988 she received the W. C. Handy Award for best traditional female blues artist. In 1987 she made her New York debut, accompanied by Evans and Walter Perkins. Her first American full-length album, \"Feelin' Good\", released in 1990, won a Handy Award for best acoustic album.\n\nIn 1993 Hemphill had a stroke, which paralyzed her left side, preventing her from playing guitar; she retired from her blues career. She continued to play by accompanying her band on the tambourine.\n\nIn 2004, the Jessie Mae Hemphill Foundation released \"Dare You to Do It Again\", a double album and DVD of gospel standards, newly recorded by the ailing vocalist, singing and playing tambourine with accompaniment from Steve Gardner, DJ Logic, and descendants of the late musicians Junior Kimbrough, R.

He wrote this paper when he was 22, a year after receiving his medical degree from Columbia University in New York. He first read the paper before the Meigs and Mason Academy of Medicine in Middleport, Ohio on February 15, 1872 and then published it in the Medical and Surgical Reporter of Philadelphia on April 13, 1872.\n\nHuntington's father and grandfather, George Lee Huntington (1811–1881) and Abel Huntington (1778–1858), were also physicians in the same family practice. Their longitudinal observations combined with his own were invaluable in precisely describing this hereditary disease in multiple generations of a family in East Hampton on Long Island.\n\nIn a 1908 review, the eminent physician William Osler said of this paper: \"In the history of medicine, there are few instances in which a disease has been more accurately, more graphically or more briefly described.\"\n\nIn 1874 George Huntington returned to Dutchess County, New York to practice medicine. He joined a number of medical associations and started working for the \"Matteawan General Hospital\". In 1908 the scientific journal \"Neurograph\" dedicated him a special edition.\n\nGeorge Huntington should not be confused with George Sumner Huntington (1861–1927), the anatomist.

The MBCBL was a member of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize co-laureate International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), Mines Action Canada, and the Cluster Munition Coalition.\n\nThe MBCBL was launched on 1 March 2002 at a ceremony at the Manitoba Legislature in Winnipeg. Premier Gary Doer and Deputy Premier Jean Friesen attended the ceremony and were joined by students from a number of Winnipeg area schools.\n\nThe main goals of the MBCBL were to raise awareness in Manitoba of the global landmine crisis and to encourage Manitobans to take action to help solve that problem. Much of the MBCBL's outreach work was focused on engaging with schools throughout Manitoba.\n\nIn early 2005, the MBCBL launched a fundraising campaign for the One Love Project in Rwanda which raised nearly $40,000. The One Love Project builds and repairs prostheses and orthoses for landmine survivors and other disabled people. Its orthopedic workshop is based in Kigali, and its mobile clinic travels to all of Rwanda's twelve provinces. In 2007, the One Love Project began to expand its operations into neighbouring Burundi. In 2008, the MBCBL added the National Committee for Demining and Rehabilitation (NCDR) in Jordan to its fundraising efforts.\n\nIn 2014, the MBCBL underwent a change in focus and was rebranded as Manitobans Against Indiscriminate Weapons (MBAIW).

Lascellas is a first cousin once removed to Queen Elizabeth II and in line of succession to the British throne.\n\nWhen young, Lascelles had classical piano and drum lessons, and claims that \"John Tavener 'taught' him to improvise\" by performing duets on a church organ.\n\nHe then became interested in jazz, blues, and rock and roll.\n\nLascelles was a co-founder of the Global Village Trucking Company, known to its fans as \"The Glob's\", in the early 1970s. The band, the road crew and their families all lived together in a commune in an old farm house in Sotherton, Suffolk, and undertook numerous benefit concerts and free festivals, playing extended free-form jams, making them a well known UK live act. The band shunned record companies, but played on the \"Greasy Truckers Live at Dingwalls Dance Hall\" benefit album at Dingwalls in 1973, and in November 1974 they recorded an eponymous album at Rockfield Studios, Monmouth, Wales.\n\nIn 1973 the BBC made a documentary about Global Village Trucking Company, their communal living and their aim to make it without a record company. The BBC updated the documentary for the \"What Happened Next\" series, shown in May 2008, which included their first gig in 30 years.

It was choreographed by Twyla Tharp. The title refers to the sunlit summer nights of Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), the setting for the majority of the film, situated just a few degrees below the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe film is notable both for the dancing of Hines and Baryshnikov and for the Academy Award–winning song \"Say You, Say Me\" by Lionel Richie in 1986, as well as \"Separate Lives\" performed by Phil Collins and Marilyn Martin and written by Stephen Bishop (also nominated). The film was the American film debut of Isabella Rossellini and Taylor Hackford met his future wife, Helen Mirren, during filming.\n\nNikolai 'Kolya' Rodchenko (Baryshnikov) is a Soviet ballet dancer who had defected from the Soviet Union. The plane carrying him to a next performance in Tokyo has electrical problems and crash lands in Siberia. He is hurt and is soon recognized by KGB officer Colonel Chaiko (Jerzy Skolimowski). Chaiko then contacts African-American tap dancer, Raymond Greenwood (Hines), who has defected to the Soviet Union, and gets them both to Leningrad. Chaiko wants Rodchenko to dance at the season's opening night at the Kirov, and Greenwood to babysit Rodchenko. To convince Rodchenko, Chaiko uses Galina Ivanova (Helen Mirren), a former ballerina who never left the Soviet Union and is an old flame of Rodchenko.\n\nAfter an initial period of racial and artistic friction, the two dancers (and defectors in opposite directions) become strong friends. When Raymond finds that his wife Darya Greenwood (Isabella Rossellini) is pregnant, he decides he does not want their child to grow up in the Soviet Union, and together, with Rodchenko, they plan an escape with the help of Galina, who still has feelings for Rodchenko. While the escape plan is going on, Raymond chooses to stay behind to delay Chaiko, gaining time for Nikolai and Darya to get to the Consulate at Leningrad. Even though Raymond is incarcerated when the whole plan is revealed, he is finally traded by the Soviets for a political prisoner from Latin America, and reunites with Darya and Nikolai.\n\n\nThe opening ballet sequence, \"Le Jeune Homme et La Mort\", originally choreographed by Roland Petit in 1946 and performed anew by Baryshnikov and Florence Faure, was filmed at the Bristol Hippodrome. The gentleman paging the curtain for Baryshnikov is John Randall, the theatre's technical director at the time.\n\nIn 1985, many western Cold War movies supposedly set in Russia would use locations in the Finnish capital Helsinki with an architectural style resembling Leningrad. For \"White Nights\", a team of travelogue filmmakers from Finland, who previously had done work in the Soviet Union, were hired to film a number of locations in Leningrad, such as the Kirov Theatre and the Lenin monument, as well as a Chaika state-limousine. These scenes were then inserted into the movie, some being in-car scenes. Hackford was disappointed with critics who wrote negative reviews based on their belief that Helsinki had been used.\n\nThe film was also shot in Finland (including the island of Reposaari) and Lisbon, Portugal, as well as other parts of the United Kingdom including Elstree Studios and RAF Machrihanish in Scotland.\n\nFilmmakers normally utilized models to film the crash-landing of an aircraft as expensive as a Boeing 747. For the filming of the crash sequence of a British Orient 747 at the beginning of \"White Nights\", two different full-sized aircraft were used. \n\nThe film contains an early-career performance by Maryam d'Abo, later to star as a Bond girl in the James Bond film \"The Living Daylights\".\n\n\"White Nights\" was dedicated \"in loving memory\" to Mary E. Hackford (mother of Taylor) and Jerry Benjamin (father of executive supervisor Stuart Benjamin), both of whom died prior to its release.\n\nThe film opened the Chicago International Film Festival on November 8, 1985 at McClurg Court. It then opened at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on November 22 as well as in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Toronto before expanding nationally on December 6.\n\n\"White Nights\" received mixed reviews from critics, as it currently holds a 46% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 reviews. \"The New York Times\" film critic Vincent Canby criticized the script as \"ludicrous\" but praised the acting and dance choreography, including Baryshnikov's \"all of the dynamic force and intelligence that distinguish his dance performances\" and Hines as \"a great tap dancer but not in the same league with Mr. Baryshnikov as a film personality\". \"Los Angeles Times\" film critic Sheila Benson criticized the story as \"wretched high-concept, low-intelligence\", the film's \"oversimplification\" of Russians as \"hateful and corrupt\" with an exception of \"old Russian \"\"\" without the film explaining the character's transition \"to kindness\", and dance performances as \"jazzed-up and simplistic\". However, the film was a commercial success at the box office, grossing over $42 million in the United States.\n\nThe soundtrack album for the film contains the most successful single on the album, \"Separate Lives\" by Phil Collins and Marilyn Martin, which reached the top of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart and was nominated for an Academy Award in 1986. The prize instead went to Lionel Richie's \"Say You, Say Me\", another chart topper which appeared in the film but was not included on the original soundtrack due to licensing issues. It was included in the album reissue as a bonus track along with \"I Don't Wanna Know\" by Phil Collins.\n\nAllmusic gave the soundtrack three stars out of five.\n\n\nSingles\n"}

Klengel also became a soloist at that point, frequently giving solo performances.\n\nKlengel rose to become principal cellist of the orchestra, aged 22, in 1881. There he remained for over four decades: to celebrate his fifty years of service, Wilhelm Furtwängler conducted a jubilee concert, in which Klengel played the cello part in a double concerto he composed for the occasion. During that time period, Klengel became professor at the Leipzig Conservatory, where he was briefly a member of Adolph Brodsky's string quartet, and began composing.

At age six, Bu was first introduced to chess by an elder cousin (his grandfather was a strong \"xiangqi\" player), and his interest grew with his compatriot Xie Jun's women's world championship victory in 1991. He began taking chess seriously at the age of nine years and received early training from then on. During this time, the newspaper \"Qingdao Daily\" founded a local chess club which many children in the city went to, including the \"Qingdao Daily\"'s chief editor's son. His first chess book was a translation of the famous \"My 60 Memorable Games\" by Bobby Fischer, a player Bu admires.

Aulick, \"Aulick\" was laid down on 3 December 1918 and launched on 11 April 1919 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation; sponsored by Mrs. Phillip J. Willett. The ship was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 26 July 1919, Lieutenant Commander Lee P. Johnson in command.\n\nFollowing her shakedown cruise, \"Aulick\" proceeded to the west coast where she joined Destroyer Flotilla 10 of the Pacific Fleet. While operating along the California coast, the vessel was given the designation DD-258 on 17 July 1920. \"Aulick\" continued to carry out routine fleet duties until she was decommissioned on 27 May 1922 at the Mare Island Navy Yard.\n\nAfter over 17 years laid up in reserve, the destroyer was recommissioned on 18 June 1939 at San Diego, California. Upon her reactivation, \"Aulick\" returned to the east coast where she served until the fall of 1940. On 8 October 1940, \"Aulick\" was decommissioned at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and transferred to the British under the agreement with the United Kingdom exchanging American destroyers for bases in the Atlantic. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 8 December 1941.\n\nRenamed HMS \"Burnham\" - in part in honour of Burnham, Pennsylvania and Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset - the destroyer began escort duties with the British Navy in December 1940. In early 1941, \"Burnham\" began a series of escort voyages between Iceland and Newfoundland. \"Burnham\" was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original /50 caliber guns and three of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar. Throughout 1942 and 1943, \"Burnham\" worked mainly between Newfoundland and Londonderry Port, Derry, Northern Ireland. \"Burnham\" was assigned to Escort Group C-2 of the Mid-Ocean Escort Force for convoys ON 113, HX 201, ON 119, SC 97, ON 129 and SC 102 and then to Escort Group C-3 for convoys ON 152, HX 221, ON 163, HX 226, ON 172, SC 124, ON 180 and HX 238 during the winter of 1942-43.\n\nIn 1942, \"Burnham\" was formally adopted by Burnham-On-Sea, Somerset, and after woollen comforts were gratefully received by the crew on board the ship from time to time. In 1944, she was used on aircraft training duties in the Western Approaches Command, which allowed a contingent from the ship to visit the Somerset town and march the streets.\n\n\"Burnham\" was reduced to reserve at Milford Haven, Wales, in November 1944. She was ultimately scrapped at Pembroke, Wales, in December 1948.\n\nOn Thursday 21 October 2004, exactly 60 years after the crew of the vessel marched through the streets of the Somerset town to cheering crowds, Ron Giles, president of the former HMS Burnham Association, unveiled a plaque on the seawall of Burnham-on-Sea.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1827682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827682", "title": "Male reproductive system", "text": "Male reproductive system\n\nThe male reproductive system consists of a number of sex organs that play a role in the process of human reproduction. These organs are located on the outside of the body and within the pelvis.\n\nThe main male sex organs are the penis and the testicles which produce semen and sperm, which, as part of sexual intercourse, fertilize an ovum in the female's body; the fertilized ovum (zygote) develops into a fetus, which is later born as an infant.\n\nThe corresponding system in females is the female reproductive system.\n\nThe penis is the male intromittent organ. It has a long shaft and an enlarged bulbous-shaped tip called the glans penis, which supports and is protected by the foreskin. When the male becomes sexually aroused, the penis becomes erect and ready for sexual activity. Erection occurs because sinuses within the erectile tissue of the penis become filled with blood. The arteries of the penis are dilated while the veins are compressed so that blood flows into the erectile cartilage under pressure. The penis is supplied by the pudendal artery.\n\nThe scrotum is a pouch-like structure that hangs behind the penis. It holds and protects the testicles. It also contains numerous nerves and blood vessels. During times of lower temperatures, the Cremaster muscle contracts and pulls the scrotum closer to the body, while the Dartos muscle gives it a wrinkled appearance; when the temperature increases, the Cremaster and Dartos muscles relax to bring down the scrotum away from the body and remove the wrinkles respectively.\n\nThe scrotum remains connected with the abdomen or pelvic cavity by the inguinal canal. (The spermatic cord, formed from spermatic artery, vein and nerve bound together with connective tissue passes into the testis through inguinal canal.)\n\nTestis has two major functions: To produce sperm by meiotic division of germ cells within the seminiferous tubules, and to synthesize and secrete androgens that regulate the male reproductive functions. The site of production of androgens is the Leydig cells that are located in the interstitium between seminoferous tubules.\n\nThe epididymis is a long whitish mass of tightly coiled tube. The sperm that are produced in the seminiferous tubules flow into the epididymis. During passage via the epididymis, the sperm undergo maturation and are concentrated by the action of ion channels located on the apical membrane of the epididymis.\n\nThe vas deferens, also known as the sperm duct, is a thin tube approximately long that starts from the epididymis to the pelvic cavity. It carries the spermatozoa from the epididymis to ejaculatory duct.\n\nThree accessory glands provide fluids that lubricate the duct system and nourish the sperm cells. They are the seminal vesicles, the prostate gland, and the bulbourethral glands (Cowper glands).\n\nThe embryonic and prenatal development of the male reproductive system is the process whereby the reproductive organs grow, mature and are established. It begins with a single fertilized egg and culminates 38 weeks later with birth of a male child. It is a part of the stages of sexual differentiation. The development of the male reproductive system coincides with the urinary system. The development of them can also be described together as the development of the urinary and reproductive organs.\n\nSexual identity is determined at fertilization when the genetic sex of the zygote has been initialized by a sperm cell containing either an X or Y chromosome. If this sperm cell contains an X chromosome it will coincide with the X chromosome of the ovum and a female child will develop. A sperm cell carrying a Y chromosome results in an XY combination, and a male child will develop.\n\nGenetic sex determines whether the gonads will be testes or ovaries. In the developing embryo if the testes are developed, it will produce and secrete male sex hormones during late embryonic development and cause the secondary sex organs of the male to develop.\n\nThe structures are masculinized by secretions of the testes:\nThe prostate gland derives from the urogenital sinus, and the other embryonic structures differentiate into the external genitalia. In the absence of testicular secretions, the female genitalia are formed.\n\nAt six weeks post conception, the differentiation of the external genitalia in the male and female has not taken place. At eight weeks, a distinct phallus is present during the indifferent stage. By the 10th-12th week, the genitalia are distinctly male or female being and derived from their homologous structures. At 16 weeks post conception, the genitalia are formed and distinct.\n\nThe masculinization of the embryonic reproductive structures occurs as a result of testosterone secreted by the embryonic testes. Testosterone, however, is not the active agent within these organs. Once inside the target cells, testosterone is converted by means of an enzyme called 5α-reductase into the dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT mediates the androgen effect in these organs.\n\nAt nine weeks, male differentiation of the gonads and the testes is well underway. Internal changes include the formation of the tubular seminar Chris tubules in the Rete testis from the primary sex cord. Developing on the outside surface of each testis is a Phibro muscular cord called the gubernaculum. This structure attaches to the inferior portion of the testis and extends to the labial sacral fold of the same side at the same time, a portion of the embryonic mesonephric duct adjacent to the testis becomes attached and convoluted informs the epididymis. Another portion of the mesonephritic duct becomes the ductus deferens.\n\nThe seminal vesicles form from lateral outgrowths of the caudal and of each mesonephritic duct the prostate gland arises from an Indo dermal outgrowth of the urogenital sinus the bulbourethral glands develop from outgrowths in the membrane-like portion of the urethra. \n\nThe descent of the testes to its final location at the anterior abdominal wall, followed by the development of the gubernaculum, which subsequently pulls and translocates the testis down into the developing scrotum. Ultimately, the passageway closes behind the testis. A failure in this process can cause indirect inguinal hernia or an infantile hydrocoele.The testes descend into the scrotal sac between the sixth and 10th week. Dissent into this not occur until about the 28th week when compared and we know canals form and the abdominal wall to provide openings from the pelvic cavity to the scrotal sac. The process by which a testis to send is not well understood but it seems to be associated with the shortening of the gubernaculum, which is attached to the testis and extends to the inguinal canal to the wall of the scrotum as a testis to sense it passes to the side of the urinary bladder and anterior to the symphysis pubis. It carries with it the ductus deference, that is testicular vessels and nerves, a portion of the abdominal muscle, and lymph vessels. All of the structures remain attached to the testis and form what is known as the spermatic cord by the time the testis is in the scrotal sac, the gubernaculum is no more than a remnant of scar like tissue.\n\nThe external genitalia of the male is distinct from those of the female by the end of the ninth week. Prior to that, the genital tubercle in both sexes is a phallus. The urethral groove forms on the ventral surface of the phallus early in development during the differentiation of the external genitalia. This is caused by the androgens produced and secreted by the testes. Androgen induced development causes the elongation and differentiation of the phallus into a penis, a fusion of the urogenital folds surrounding the urethral groove along the ventral surface of the penis, and a midline closure of the labioscrotal folds. This closure forms the wall of the scrotum the external genitalia. The external genitalia are completely formed by the end of the 12th week.\n\nAt birth, the development of the prepubertal male reproductive system is completed. During the second trimester of pregnancy, testosterone secretion in the male declines so that at birth the testes are inactive. Gonadotropin secretion is low until the beginning of puberty.\n\nThe genetic sex is determined by whether a Y bearing or next bearing sperm fertilizes the open; the presence or absence of a Y chromosome in turn determines whether the gonads of the embryo will be testes or ovaries; and the presence or absence of testes, finally, determines whether the sex accessory organs and external genitalia will be male or female. This sequence is understandable in light of the fact that both male and female embryos develop within the maternal environment - high in estrogen secreted by the mother's ovaries and the placenta. If estrogen determined the gender, all embryos would become feminized.\n\nDuring puberty, increased gonadotropin secretion stimulates a rise in sex steroids creation from the testes. The increased secretion of testosterone from the testes during puberty causes the male secondary sexual characteristics to be manifested.\n\nMale secondary sex characteristics include:\n\n\nSecondary development includes the increased activity of the eccrine sweat glands and sebaceous glands along with the darkening of the skin in the scrotal region.\n\nChromosomal abnormalities can occur during fertilization impacting the development of the male reproductive system. The genotype of the male consists of a Y chromosome paired with an X chromosome. Female gender is determined by the absence of a Y chromosome. Some individuals are male who have the XX male syndrome and androgen insensitivity syndrome. This occurs when one X chromosome contains a segment of the Y chromosome, which was inserted into the X chromosome of the father's sperm. Rarely females are born with the XY genotype. They are found to be missing the same portion of the Y chromosome it was inserted into the chromosome of XX males. The gene for sexual differentiation in humans, called the testis determining factor (TDF), is located on the short arm of the Y chromosome. The presence or absence of the Y chromosome determines whether the embryo will have testes or ovaries. An abnormal number of sex chromosomes (aneuploidy) may can occur. This includes Turner's syndrome - a single X chromosome is present, Klinefelter's syndrome - two X chromosomes and a Y chromosome are present, XYY syndrome and XXYY syndrome. Other less common chromosomal arrangements include: triple X syndrome, 48, XXXX, and 49, XXXXX. \nThe observable, visual differences become apparent between male or the female reproductive organs are not seeing initially. Maturation continues as the medial aspect of each mesonephros grows to form the gonadal ridge. The gonadal ridge continues to grow behind the developing peritoneal membrane. By week six, string-like cell congregations called primitive sex cords form within the enlarging gonadal ridge. Externally, a swelling called the genital tubercle appears above the cloacal membrane. \n\nExternal distinctions are not observed even by the eighth week of pre-embryonic development. This is the indifferent stage during which the gonads are relatively large and have an outer cortex of primitive sex cords and an inner medulla.\n\nSpecialized primordial germ cells are forming and migrating from the yolk sac to the embryonic gonads during week eight and nine. These are the spermatagonia in the developing male. Before seven weeks after fertilization, the gonads have the potential to become either testes or ovaries. Reproductive sex organs for both male and female are derived from the same embryonic tissues and are considered homologous tissues or organs.\n\nAfter the testes have differentiated, male sex hormones, called androgens, are secreted from interstitial cells (cells of Leydig). The major androgens secreted by these cells is testosterone and secretion begins 8 to 10 weeks after conception. Testosterone secretion reaches a peak at 12 to 14 weeks, and declines to very low levels by the end of the second trimester (about 21 weeks). Levels are the barely detectable 4–6 months of age postnatal. High levels of testosterone will not appear again until the time of puberty.\n\nInternal accessory sex organs to develop and most of these are derived from two systems of embryonic ducts. Male accessory organs are derived from mesonephric (wolfian) ducts. The developing tubules within the testes secretes a polypeptide Müllerian inhibition factor (MIF). MIF causes the regression of the paramesonephritic ducts 60 days after fertilization. Testosterone secretion by the interstitial cells of the testes then causes the growth and development of the mesonephric ducts into male secondary sex organs. The Müllerian ducts atrophy, but traces of their anterior ends are represented by the appendices testis (hydatids of Morgagni of the male), while their terminal fused portions form the utriculus on the floor of the prostatic urethra. This is due to the production of Anti-Müllerian hormone by the Sertoli cells of the testes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1827690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827690", "title": "Bedford (UK Parliament constituency)", "text": "Bedford (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nBedford is a constituency. The seat dates to the earliest century of regular parliaments, in 1295; its double representation was halved in 1885, then being altered by the later-termed Fourth Reform Act in 1918.\n\nSave for two elections in 1974 and one in 1964 when the seat leant to the right bucking the national result, the affiliation of the winning candidate was that of the winning party nationally for the years 1951–2015 – a bellwether.\n\nBedford is a marginal seat between the Labour Party and the Conservatives. The main settlement is Bedford, a well-developed town centre with a considerable amount of social housing relative to Bedfordshire and higher poverty index but on a fast railway link to London and other destinations, the town is at the north end of the Thameslink service to Brighton and is not far from Milton Keynes which has a larger economy. The smaller and contiguous town of Kempston is also in the constituency.\n\nBedford was first represented in the Model Parliament of 1295. The constituency was originally a parliamentary borough electing two Members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons, and consisted of the five parishes making up the town of Bedford.\n\nBefore the Reform Act of 1832, the right to vote was exercised by all freemen and burgesses of the town (whether or not they lived within the borough boundaries) and by all householders who were not receiving alms. This was a fairly wide franchise for the period, but potentially subject to abuse since the Corporation of the borough had unlimited power to create freemen. The Corporation was usually under the influence of the Dukes of Bedford, but their influence usually fell well short of making Bedford a pocket borough.\n\nIn 1768, a majority of the corporation apparently fell out with the Duke at the time, and decided to free the borough from his influence. They elected a Huntingdonshire squire, Sir Robert Bernard, as Recorder of the borough, and made 500 new freemen, mostly Bernard's Huntingdonshire neighbours or tenants. As there were only 540 householders, this gave him the effective power to choose Bedford's MPs; at the next election the defeated candidates petitioned against the result, attempting to establish that so many non-residents should not be allowed to vote, but the Commons dismissed the petition and confirmed the right of all the freemen, however created, to vote.\n\nBernard cemented his control with the creation of hundreds of further freemen in the next few years; at around the same period he lent the Corporation £950, and it is not unreasonable to assume this was payment for services rendered. However, in 1789, the young Duke of Bedford managed to regain the Corporation's loyalty, and had 350 of his own retainers made freemen.\n\nEven at other periods, the influence of the Dukes seems sometimes to have been more nominal than real. In the 1750s and 1760s, before Bernard's intervention, a frequent compromise was that the Duke nominated one MP and the Corporation (representing the interests of the town) the other; but it seems that on occasion the Duke had to be flexible to retain the semblance of local deference towards him, and that his \"nominee\" had in reality been imposed upon him. Nor was the outcome invariably successfully predetermined: at the 1830 election the result swung on one individual's vote – the defeated candidate being Lord John Russell, who was not only one of the Whig leaders but The Duke of Bedford's son.\n\nIn 1831, the population of the borough was 6,959, and contained 1,491 houses. This was sufficient for Bedford to retain both its MPs under the Great Reform Act, with its boundaries unaltered. The reformed franchise introduced in 1832 gave the borough 1,572 inhabitants qualified to vote. The town was growing, and Bedford retained its borough status until the 1918 general election, although under the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885, its representation was reduced to a single MP. On the eve of the First World War, its population was just under 40,000, of whom 6,500 people were eligible to vote.\n\nUnder the Representation of the People Act 1918, the Parliamentary Borough was abolished; but the town gave its name to a new county constituency (formerly The Bedford division of Bedfordshire). As well as the town of Bedford, it covered the northern end of the county and included Kempston and Eaton Socon together with the surrounding rural area, which had previously been part of the abolished Biggleswade Division.\n\nUnder the Representation of the People Act 1948, a boundary change which came into effect at the 1950 election reduced its size somewhat, with part of the Bedford Rural District, including Eaton Socon, being transferred to the Mid Bedfordshire constituency.\n\nUnder the Third Review of Westminster Constituencies in 1983, the constituency was abolished and absorbed into the new County Constituency of North Bedfordshire, with the exception of Kempston, which was transferred to Mid Bedfordshire.\n\nUnder the Fourth Review, effective from the 1997 general election, Bedford was restored as a Borough Constituency, comprising the town of Bedford from the now abolished constituency of North Bedfordshire, and Kempston, regained from Mid Bedfordshire.\n\nIn the latest boundary changes under the Fifth Review, effective from the 2010 general election, there were marginal gains from Mid Bedfordshire due to the revision of local authority wards.\n\n1918–1950: The Municipal Borough of Bedford, the Urban District of Kempston, and the Rural Districts of Bedford and Eaton Socon.\n\n1950–1983: The Municipal Borough of Bedford, the Urban District of Kempston, and part of the Rural District of Bedford.\n\n1997–2010: The Borough of Bedford wards of Brickhill, Castle, Cauldwell, De Parys, Goldington, Harpur, Kempston East, Kempston West, Kingsbrook, Newnham, Putnoe, and Queen's Park.\n\n2010–present: The Borough of Bedford wards of Brickhill, Castle, Cauldwell, De Parys, Goldington, Harpur, Kempston Central and East, Kempston North, Kempston South, Kingsbrook, Newnham, Putnoe, Queens Park.\n\nThis was the smallest Labour majority at the 2019 general election.\n\nGeneral Election 1914/15\n\nAnother General Election was required to take place before the end of 1915. The political parties had been making preparations for an election to take place and by the July 1914, the following candidates had been selected;\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Apart from four early years, the constituency has returned a Conservative since its creation in 1918.\n\nMid Bedfordshire was created under the Representation of the People Act 1918.\n\nIt has elected Conservative MPs since 1931. It was held from 1983 to 1997 by the Attorney General (for the English, Welsh and Northern Irish aspects of the legal system and as advisor to HM Government) Sir Nicholas Lyell, who then transferred to the newly created seat of North East Bedfordshire; his old seat was won by Jonathan Sayeed, a former MP in Bristol. Sayeed was forced to retire in 2005 due to ill health, following a row over allegations he had profited from his private educational tours of Parliament and a resulting deselection attempt by the constituency party. Nadine Dorries has held the seat since, but the Conservative whip was withdrawn from her in 2012 and returned six months later, after appearing on \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\".

{"id": "1827695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827695", "title": "The Bluest Eye", "text": "The Bluest Eye\n\n\"The Bluest Eye,\" published in 1970, is the first novel written by author Toni Morrison. Morrison was an African-American novelist, a Pulitzer and Nobel Prize winner whose works are praised for addressing the harsh consequences of racism in the United States.\n\nThe novel takes place in Lorain, Ohio (Morrison's own home town), and tells the story of a young African-American lady named Pecola who grows up during the years following the Great Depression. Set in 1941, the story tells that due to her mannerisms and dark skin, she is consistently regarded as \"ugly\". As a result, she develops an inferiority complex, which fuels her desire for the blue eyes she equates with \"whiteness\".\n\nThe point of view of the novel switches between various perspectives of Claudia MacTeer, the daughter of Pecola's foster parents, at different stages in her life. In addition, there is an omniscient third-person narrative which includes inset narratives in the first person.\n\nIts controversial topics of racism, incest, and child molestation have led to numerous attempts to ban the novel from schools and libraries.\n\nIn Lorain, Ohio, nine-year-old Claudia MacTeer and her 10-year-old sister Frieda live with their parents, a tenant named Mr. Henry, and Pecola Breedlove, a temporary foster child whose house was burned down by her unstable, alcoholic, and sexually abusive father. Pecola is a quiet, passive young girl who grows up with little money and whose parents are constantly fighting, both verbally and physically. Pecola is continually reminded of what an \"ugly\" girl she is by members of her neighborhood and school community. In an attempt to beautify herself, Pecola wishes for blue eyes. Additionally, most chapters' titles are extracts from the \"Dick and Jane\" paragraph in the novel's prologue, presenting a white family that may be contrasted with Pecola's. The chapter titles contain sudden repetition of words or phrases, many cut-off words, and no interword separations.\n\nThe novel, through flashbacks, explores the younger years of both of Pecola's parents, Cholly and Pauline, and their struggles as African Americans in a largely White Anglo-Saxon Protestant community. Pauline now works as a servant for a wealthier white family. One day in the novel's present time, while Pecola is doing dishes, drunk Cholly rapes her. His motives are largely confusing, seemingly a combination of both love and hate. After raping her a second time, he flees, leaving her pregnant.\n\nClaudia and Frieda are the only two in the community that hope for Pecola's child to survive in the coming months. Consequently, they give up the money they had been saving to buy a bicycle, instead planting marigold seeds with the superstitious belief that if the flowers bloom, Pecola's baby will survive. The marigolds never bloom, and Pecola's child, who is born prematurely, dies. In the aftermath, a dialogue is presented between two sides of Pecola's own deluded imagination, in which she indicates conflicting feelings about her rape by her father. In this internal conversation, Pecola speaks as though her wish for blue eyes has been granted, and believes that the changed behavior of those around her is due to her new eyes, rather than the news of her rape or her increasingly strange behavior.\n\nClaudia, as narrator a final time, describes the recent phenomenon of Pecola's insanity and suggests that Cholly (who has since died) may have shown Pecola the only love he could by raping her. Claudia laments on her belief that the whole community, herself included, have used Pecola as a scapegoat to make themselves feel prettier and happier.\n\n\nWhen asked about her motivations for writing \"The Bluest Eye\" in an interview, Morrison claimed that she wanted to remind readers \"how hurtful racism is\" and that people are \"apologetic about the fact that their skin [is] so dark.\" Reminiscing about her own experience, she recalled: \"When I was a kid, we called each other names but we didn't think it was serious, that you could take it in.\" Expanding on this point of self-esteem, Morrison elaborated that she \"wanted to speak on behalf of those who didn't catch that [they were beautiful] right away. [She] was deeply concerned about the feelings of ugliness.\" As seen throughout \"The Bluest Eye\", this idea of \"ugliness\" is conveyed through a variety of characters. For example, Pecola, the main character, wishes for blue eyes as a way to escape the oppression that results from her having dark skin. Through Pecola's characterization, Morrison seeks to demonstrate the negative impact racism can have on one's self-confidence and worth. As she concluded in her interview, she \"wanted people to understand what it was like to be treated that way.\"\n\nMorrison commented on her motivations to write the novel, saying, \"I felt compelled to write this mostly because in the 1960s, black male authors published powerful, aggressive, revolutionary fiction or nonfiction, and they had positive racially uplifting rhetoric with them that were stimulating and I thought they would skip over something and thought no one would remember that it wasn't always beautiful.\"\n\nMorrison's writing of the book began because she was \"interested in talking about black girlhood.\" Dr. Jan Furman, professor of English at the University of Michigan, notes that the book allows the reader to analyze the \"imprinting\" factors that shape the identity of the self during the process of maturing in young black girls. She references parts in the book where the main characters are taught to feel less than human, specifically when the shopkeeper avoids touching Pecola's hand when giving her candy.\n\nSusmita Roye, an associate professor of English at Delaware State University, notes that the novel emphasizes that living in a world defined by Euro-centric beauty standards creates a longing for whiteness, such as Pecola's desire for blue eyes, which attacks young black girls' confidence and perceived beauty. References to Shirley Temple and Dick and Jane serve similarly.\n\nDick and Jane novels were popular in the mid-20th century, and Morrison includes references to their titles in \"The Bluest Eye\". They promoted the importance of the nuclear family and helped to foster literacy in young children as well. Morrison presents a more critical view of the novel's family standards. Morrison's graphic storytelling within \"The Bluest Eye\" challenged existing attitudes about keeping children's literature free of sex and violence. The lifestyle standards found in Dick and Jane were not achievable for many children who shared backgrounds similar to Pecola.\n\nDebra Werrlein, professor at George Mason University, contends that the excerpts of \"Dick and Jane\" throughout the book project an image of an ideal family that contrasts with the family structures of the main characters. She argues that because the novel takes place in a time of post-World War II social sentiments, the \"Dick and Jane\" primer emphasizes an importance of raising children a certain way to mold the future of the United States. However, as Werrlein points out, the whiteness of these characters stood to represent the ideal American family. In addition, the string of letters describing Dick and Jane's perfect parents as strong and kind are used to contrast Pecola's parents in the novel. Pecola's father is thus emasculated, Werrlein argues, because his behavior deviates from this standard for American family life. Finally, Werrlein claims that the black parents have experienced oppression throughout their lives, and that same oppression has negatively influenced their familial structure. Thus, racism is a prevalent factor in their broken homes.\n\nIn the article \"Racism and Appearance in The Bluest Eye: A Template for an Ethical Emotive Criticism\", Jerome Bump explains how the novel suggests that physical beauty is a virtue embedded in society. Bump asserts that the novel reveals the belief that the outside of people ultimately reflects their character and personality. This belief compromises people's judgement and they act upon internal bias. These biases are displayed throughout the novel, especially through the mistreatment of Pecola by family, friends and community.\n\nLiterary critic Lynn Scott argues that the constant images of whiteness in \"The Bluest Eye\" serve to represent society's perception of beauty, which ultimately proves to have destructive consequences for many of the characters in the novel. Scott explains that in the novel, superiority, power, and virtue are associated with beauty, which is inherent in whiteness. She further asserts that white beauty standards are perpetuated by visual images in the media as well as the attitude of Pecola's family. When Pauline first arrives in Lorain, she feels pressure to conform and begins to develop a construct of femininity based on the actresses such as Jean Harlow. Pecola is also surrounded by constant images that perpetuate white beauty standards, including references to Shirley Temple and an image of Mary Jane that appears on her candy wrappers. Scott believes that Pecola attempts to seek the power associated with whiteness, and in her attempt to conform, she develops a destructive desire for blue eyes.\n\nHarihar Kulkarni, an author of a book on African-American feminist fiction literature, recognizes that these Euro-centric ideals of family and beauty present in \"The Bluest Eye\" are shown to be transferred generationally, often between female relationships. In addition to living in a white-dominant society, this intergenerational oppression manifests itself into shame and self-hatred as demonstrated through Pecola's character development.\n\nCritic Allen Alexander argues that religion is an important theme in \"The Bluest Eye\", since Morrison's work possesses a \"fourth face\" outside of the Christian Trinity, which represents \"the existence of evil, the suffering of the innocent.\" Alexander claims Pecola's suffering stems from her attempts to rationalize her misfortune with the notion of an omnipotent God. He further argues that much of Pecola's story suggests the insufficiency of Christian beliefs for minorities who exist in a predominantly white society. This ideology damages Pecola and her mother, Pauline, who fully accepts Christianity and spends her time caring for a white family as opposed to her own. Alexander suggests that the image of a more human God represents a traditional African view of deities, better suiting the lives of the African-American characters.\n\nIn the essays \"Disconnections from the Motherline: Gender Hegemonies and the Loss of the Ancient Properties; \"The Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby\"\" and \"Maternal Interventions: Resistance and Power; \"The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, Beloved, Paradise\",\" Andrea O'Reilly, a women's studies professor, proclaims that African-American women pass on cultural knowledge to successive generations through the process of motherline: “the ancestral memory and ancient properties of traditional black culture. O’Reilly claims that \"The Bluest Eye\" portrays how attempting to assimilate to white American ideologies effectively undermines the motherline process for African-American women.\n\nKuenz shows that Claudia conforms to what white society expects of her, as her affinity for Shirley Temple and other manifestations of whiteness illustrates the influence of the power of mass media.[49] Kuenz insists that The Bluest Eye demonstrates the impact of mass-produced images in a hegemonic society.\n\nIn the article “Treatment of Violence: A Study of Morrison's the \"Bluest Eye\" and \"Beloved,\"\" Shubhanku Kochar argues that the theme of violence in the \"Bluest Eye\" is not discussed enough. Kochar, a professor of English in India, asserts that the powerful white characters psychologically abuse people of inferior cultures and races, which results in a dominant theme of violence in the novel. She adds that psychoanalytical study focuses on these race-based tensions that consistently cause emotional harm. The Marxist frame targets class relations, while the feminist lens centers on violence perpetrated on women. Kochar argues that to comprehend the complex violence inflicted on Pecola, one must analyze the novel through the Marxist and Feminist lens in addition to the psychoanalytical lens.\nJ. Brooks Bouson, English professor at Loyola University Chicago, claims that \"The Bluest Eye\" is a \"shame drama and trauma narrative,\" that uses Pecola and its other characters to examine how people respond to shame. Bouson argues that some characters, like Claudia, show how people can respond violently to shame: Claudia does this by rejecting the racist system she lives in and destroying the white dolls she is given. However, most characters in the novel pass on their shame to someone below them on the social and racial ladder. For example, Soaphead Church comes from a family obsessed with lightening their skin tone, and passes on the shame of his African-American heritage by molesting young girls. Bouson suggests that all of the African-American characters in \"The Bluest Eye\" exhibit shame, and eventually much of this shame is passed onto Pecola, who is at the bottom of the racial and social ladder.\n\nIn the article \"Probing Racial Dilemmas in the Bluest Eye with the Spyglass of Psychology\", Anna Zebialowicz and Marek Palasinski discuss the racial climate of the society set forth in the novel. Zebialowicz and Palasinski explain how Pecola struggles with her identity as a black girl: \"Ethnic identity and gender dilemmas are still both anecdotally and empirically linked to a decrease in self-esteem, adaptiveness and well-being\". Pecola's race and gender both work adversely against her to create a complex form of oppression. Morrison's novel confronts self-hatred and destructive behaviors black women participate in to fit into the hegemonic image of beauty and whiteness.\n\nAuthor Phillip Page focuses on the importance of duality in \"The Bluest Eye\". He claims that Morrison presents an \"inverted world,\" entirely opposite from the Dick and Jane story that is at the beginning of the novel. The idea of breaks and splitting is common, as seen in the context of the war occurring in the time period of the story, the split nature of Pecola's family, and the watermelon that Cholly observes break open during a flashback. Page argues that breaks symbolize the challenges of African-American life, as seen in the rip in the Breedloves' couch that symbolizes poverty, or the break in Pauline's tooth that ruins her marriage and family. He goes on to identify how each of the characters are broken personally, since Cholly's former and present life is described as chaotic and jumbled, and Pauline both is responsible for her biological family as well as the white family she works for. The epitome of this, Page argues, is seen in Pecola at the end of the novel. The events of her life, having broken parents in a broken family, have resulted in a totally fractured personality which drives Pecola into madness.\n\nToni Morrison's work \"The Bluest Eye\" breaks the long tradition of narratives that discuss the hardships of war and depression in the 1940s, as she brings forth a unique and untold point of view in American historical fiction. Morrison purposefully writes stories that defy the “American mainstream ideology” by focusing in on the realities of African-American life at the time. Thus, \"The Bluest Eye\" serves as a counter narrative, a method of the telling the accounts of people whose stories are rarely told and deliberately hidden. As Morrison once stated, “my job becomes how to rip that veil drawn over proceedings too terrible to relate. The exercise is also critical for any person who is black, or who belongs to any marginalized category, for, historically, we were seldom invited to participate in the discourse even when we were its topic.” In this novel, Morrison depicts a protagonist, Pecola, an ugly black young girl who is a victim of this perpetual racism and denial that Morrison discusses.\n\nAs the Civil Rights Movement began to decline in favor of conservative ideals and white power, American culture soon fostered a national identity that excluded anyone who was not white. One example of this is how historically racist ideologies influence the Soaphead Church in the novel. University of Oxford professor Tessa Roynon, who studies African-American literature, states that “the racial theories of Hume, Kant, Jefferson, and others, derived from innovations in classificatory systems by scientists such as Linnaeus, have been collected in useful readers such as Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze's anthology Race and the Enlightenment (1997). The well-read, race-obsessed Soaphead Church in The Bluest Eye is the inevitable product of these theories.\" These perpetual racist beliefs shape Pecola's self destructiveness, she is suspicious of even her own blackness, and desires the characteristics of a white person, like those in the Dick and Jane primers. As Abdellatif Khayati, professor at the Moroccan Cultural Studies Center, articulates, \"The Bluest Eye\" shows how the historic white narrative creates an “epistemic violence of the Other [which] operates through the internalization of the self-as-other. Pecola exists only in the image reflected by the Other.” Just as Pecola's rape is concealed throughout the story, the novel exposes a history of failed pursuits of hiding the racist and sexist establishments that directly provoke each character's hardships.\n\nWhile Morrison is a notable female writer, she is quick to deny her works being categorized as “feminist,” as she believes the title denies the specific necessities of black women. Rather than depict strong female protagonists, Morrison creates characters who are actually defeated by the racism and sexism of the historic time period. Anne Salvatore, a professor of English at Rider University, interprets this failure of the “anti heroine” as a stark contrast to the typical bildungsroman, where a male character defeats obstacles and grows from experience. Instead, in \"The Bluest Eye,\" Pecola fails to develop an individual identity in the face of an oppressive society, and her self-hatred forces her to retreat from reality completely.\n\nThe point of views in the novel are also significant to its unique style. Morrison combines many narratives: two perspectives of Claudia at different times in her life, as well as an omniscient third person who connects the many tragedies of the characters. By the end of the novel, the jumbled words of the Dick and Jane primer, as well as the increasingly confusing narratives, hint at Pecola's descent into madness. This breakdown in the novel's structure also represents a destruction of the harmful ideologies which Morrison's stories seeks to debase.\n\nThe novel received minimal critical attention when first published; however, it was placed on many university reading lists in black-studies departments, which promoted further recognition. Morrison was praised for her handling of difficult themes: critic Haskel Frankel said, \"Given a scene that demands a writer's best, Morrison responds with control and talent.\" The first major sign that the book would succeed was an extremely positive review in \"The New York Times\" in November 1970. Morrison was also positively reviewed for her break from the status quo of usual novels from the time period, writing to a wider audience and focusing on black subculture in the 1940s, rather than the military culture of the time. African-American critic Ruby Dee wrote, \"Toni Morrison has not written a story really, but a series of painfully accurate impressions.\" Morrison was additionally praised for her wide coverage of emotion in the novel, extending from Pecola Breedlove's quiet descent into madness, to Cholly Breedlove's skewed mindsets.\n\nCritics picked up on Morrison's shortcomings as a first time published author. A common critique of her writing included her language in the novel, as it was often viewed as being made too simple for the reader. Early critics were also ambivalent about Morrison's portrayal of the black woman as an object in society rather than a person, only ever going so far as to bring this fact to light and rarely commenting past it. The most in-depth analysis of the novel began with feminist critique. There were also notable differences between African-American critics (who often identified more with the characters of the novel) and Euro-American critics (who often only focused on the actual writing of the novel).\n\nWithin classrooms across the country, educators also disagreed over whether or not the novel was appropriate for children. One African-American educator, founder of the IFE Academy of Teaching & Technology Shekema Silveri, has stated: \"Teaching novels like \"The Bluest Eye\" helps us break down barriers with students. After reading the book, I had a student who said that she is the product of incest. And I’ve had a student who said that she was molested by her uncle. Books allow us to help them heal in ways that we as educators couldn’t help them heal on our own.\" In an interview, American Library Association (ALA) editor Robert P. Doyle also recognized the potential of novels like \"The Bluest Eye\" to affect positive change within schools, stating that, “The book community realized that [they] have not only an opportunity, but a responsibility to engage the American public in a conversation about the First Amendment as it relates to books and literature.” \"The Bluest Eye\" is one of many novels on the ALA's lists of challenged books, appearing as 15th out of 100 of the most challenged novels in the most recent decade.\n\nAs time passed, more reviews and analyses were written in praise of Morrison's writing of the \"colonization of the mind,\" her critique of white versus black beauty standards, and even began to analyze her use of simplistic language, calling it a stylistic choice rather than a pitfall of the novel. Despite initial controversies surrounding the subject matter of \"The Bluest Eye\", Morrison was eventually recognized for her contributions to literature when she received the Nobel Prize in 1993, over 20 years following the original publication of the novel.\n\n\"The Bluest Eye\" landed the fifth spot on the American Library Association (ALA) list of most challenged books in 2006. It was the second most challenged book of 2013 and the fourth most challenged book of 2014. According to the ALA, the reasons reported for challenges are \"offensive language, sexually explicit, unsuited to age group, [and] violence\".\n\n\"The Bluest Eye\" was legally challenged on February 10, 1998 by a mother from Montgomery County, Maryland named Christine Schwalm. She brought \"The Bluest Eye\" and four other books to the attention of the Montgomery County school board, describing \"The Bluest Eye\" and others as \"lewd, adult books.\" Ms. Schwalm argued for the removal of the book from the syllabus because she deemed them to be \"at odds with the character education programme\" promoted within the schools. In court, Ms Schwalm read a passage specifically from \"The Bluest Eye\" in order to demonstrate the inappropriate nature of the content within the novel. The passage in question featured Soaphead Church and presented pedophelia and child molesting, leading to Schwalm's objections to its presence in schools. The book, however, was not removed from the curriculum as Schwalm's objections were not upheld in court.\n\nIn March 1999, \"The Bluest Eye\" was successfully banned from Baker High School language arts program in Baker City, Oregon after multiple complaints from parents about the content of the book. The original source of contention for this novel was the rape scene between Cholly and Pecola. Later, the book was banned for being \"sexually explicit,\" \"unsuited for age group,\" and containing \"controversial issues.\" The decision was made by Baker City schools superintendent Arnold Coe, and was supported by the school board.\n\nIn 1999, parents of students at Stevens High School in Claremont, New Hampshire, objected to the book's being assigned to lower grade levels. The case started when parents complained to the school that they thought the book contained content that was sexually inappropriate for children. As a result, the school decided to remove the book from freshmen and sophomore reading lists, and deemed that the novel was only \"suitable\" for juniors and seniors. In addition, the school also ruled that teachers must send reading lists to parents early on in the year to get their approval as to which books their children could read and discuss in class. While some parents would have preferred heavier restrictions against the book at Stevens High School, they were glad that action was taken, as they viewed \"The Bluest Eye\" to be an \"adult book.\"\n\nIn August 2005 in Littleton, Colorado, the Littleton school board voted to ban \"The Bluest Eye\" from reading lists, where it was listed as optional, and remove it from the libraries of the Heritage and Arapahoe high schools, despite the recommendation of a committee that the book be restricted to juniors and seniors. The ban was enacted in response to a complaint received by a parent of a ninth-grader student who was on the board and who took issue with the novel's sexual content, specifically the scene of Pecola's rape. Students protested the ban by reading passages from the book in their school libraries. In response to the ban, Camille Okoren, a student attending the sit-in acknowledged that \"students hear about rape and incest in the news media. It's better to learn about those subjects from a Nobel Prize winner...and to discuss it with a teacher in class.\" Ultimately, the book was reinstated after English teacher Judy Vlasin filed an application to the board explaining why it should not be banned.\n\nIn February 2007, a group called LOVE (the Livingston Organization for Values in Education) challenged four books in the Howell High School curriculum, including \"The Bluest Eye,\" \"Black Boy\" by Richard Wright, \"Slaughterhouse Five\" by Kurt Vonnegut, and \"The Freedom Writers Diary\". The National Coalition Against Censorship published a letter in response to the criticism, claiming that the scenes which involve sex \"represent small but essential parts of the novels, consistent with the kind of material that high school students frequently read.\" Their letter also argued that the books in question \"are widely recognized as works of significant literary and artistic merit,\" and \"are widely taught in high schools and colleges around the country\".\n\nDespite controversy, the curriculum was in fact approved in a 5-to-2 decision by the Howell School Board. In response to the legal concerns raised by LOVE, Livingston Prosecutor David Morse, the Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, and the U.S. Attorney confirmed that no laws, state or federal, had been broken by including the selected books in the curriculum. Since the case, the books have been included in 11th grade advanced English curriculum.\n\nIn 2013, a group of parents challenged \"The Bluest Eye's\" inclusion in Legacy High School's AP English curriculum due to the book's sexual content and \"subject matter\" of a girl getting raped by her father. In their petition launched through \"Change.org\", the parents argued that they \"did not want developmentally inappropriate and graphic books used for classroom instruction.\" In a formal petition submitted to the superintendent, parent Janela Karlson claimed the introduction of sexually graphic material including rape and incest could be developmentally harmful to minors as supported by scientific research.\n\nIn response to the challenge, Legacy High School student Bailey Cross created a petition to maintain the book in the curriculum, and expressed the importance of retaining the book because \"Banning and censoring this tells students that ... racism, incest, rape, abuse, are taboo subjects that should not be mentioned.\" Numerous teachers also spoke out against the ban, stating that the book was used to analyze Morrison's writing style and that banning it could set a precedent for censorship in the district. Ultimately, the Adams County School Board voted to retain the Superintendent's original ruling of the 2010 challenge, which not only restricted the book to AP curriculum but also required teachers to notify parents before their child read the book.\n\nIn September, 2013, \"The Bluest Eye\" was challenged by the Ohio Board of Education President Debe Terhar. This book was listed as recommended reading in the state's Common Core standards, but was challenged at the state's Board of Education, with teachers pushing to ban it from the classroom due to its explicit content. Terhar took particular issue when it came to the scene regarding Pecola being raped by her father. Although not seen commenting on previous challenges to her books, Morrison specifically commented on this particular incident: \"I mean if it's Texas or North Carolina as it has been in all sorts of states. But to be a girl from Ohio, writing about Ohio having been born in Lorain, Ohio. And actually relating as an Ohio person, to have the Ohio, what—Board of Education?—is ironic at the least.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to Debe Terhar, explaining that it was her personal opinion that novel was \"pornographic.\" This received major push-back, with Mark Smith, Ohio Christian University president, saying, \"I see an underlying socialist-communist agenda ... that is anti what this nation is about.\" Despite the publicity, \"The Bluest Eye\" remained on the recommended reading list.\n\nIn July, 2014, East Wake High School in North Carolina removed \"The Bluest Eye\" from their reading lists due to what was deemed inappropriate content. In particular, the school highlighted the fact that the book contains \"a description of a father raping his daughter.\" Furthermore, East Wake High assigned an alternative book to their reading list, \"The Color Purple\". \"The Bluest Eye\", however, was still left available within their libraries for students to read if they wish at their own discretion, as the school wished to make clear that they were not \"denying students access to that level of literature.\"\n\nIn 2016, \"The Bluest Eye\" was challenged in the Northville, Michigan school district after a parent filed a complaint petitioning for the removal of the book from the AP Literature and Composition curriculum, stating the book's portrayal of sexual assault was not age-appropriate. A committee, consisting of a school administrator and other educators, evaluated the book and recommended that the board vote to maintain the book in the AP curriculum and allow students the option to choose an alternative book. The committee announced their decision explaining that removing the book \"would eliminate the opportunity for deep study by our student[s] on critical themes in our society.\" Despite some support for the ban, many parents and students objected to it, with one student stating, \"The purpose of AP literature as a class is to expand our understanding and enlarge our world, not make us more comfortable inside boxes of ignorance.\" Parents and students opposed to the ban were also supported by national organizations including the National Council of Teachers of English, NCAC, and ALA. After voting, the board ultimately sided with the evaluation of the committee and retained the book in the AP curriculum.\n\nIn September 2017, \"The Bluest Eye\" was challenged at North Buncombe High School in Buncombe County, North Carolina, by a parent, Tim Coley. Tim Coley, a self-described \"Christian single dad\", took notice of the book for its sexual content and formed a committee concerning the removal of the book in the English honors academics. Coley told WLOS-13 that \"It's astounding really that somebody thinks it's OK for kids to be reading this in school.\" Eric Grant, the English coordinator, defended the book by making the committee aware that the school offered an alternative assignment for those who were not comfortable with the book. He also mentioned that the book was in the syllabus that was handed out at the beginning of the year. The committee was given time to read the book and determine if there was academic value offered from the book.\n\nAn adaptation of \"The Bluest Eye\" by Lydia R. Diamond was first performed in Chicago, Illinois in 2005, before seeing further adaptations around the United States.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1827698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827698", "title": "A Legend of Old Egypt", "text": "A Legend of Old Egypt\n\n\"A Legend of Old Egypt\" (Polish: \"\"Z legend dawnego Egiptu\"\") is a short story by Bolesław Prus, originally published January 1, 1888, in New Year's supplements to the Warsaw \"Kurier Codzienny\" (Daily Courier) and \"Tygodnik Ilustrowany\" (Illustrated Weekly). It was his first piece of historical fiction and later served as a preliminary sketch for his only historical novel, \"Pharaoh\" (1895), which would be serialized in the Illustrated Weekly.\n\n\"A Legend of Old Egypt\" and \"Pharaoh\" show unmistakable kinships in setting, theme and denouement.\n\nThe centenarian pharaoh Ramses is breathing his last, \"his chest... invested by a stifling incubus [that drains] the blood from his heart, the strength from his arm, and at times even the consciousness from his brain.\" He commands the wisest physician at the Temple of Karnak to prepare him a medicine that kills or cures at once. After Ramses drinks the potion, he summons an astrologer and asks what the stars show. The astrologer replies that heavenly alignments portend the death of a member of the dynasty; Ramses should not have taken the medicine today. Ramses then asks the physician how soon he will die; the physician replies that before sunrise either Ramses will be hale as a rhino, or his sacred ring will be on the hand of his grandson and successor, Horus.\n\nRamses commands that Horus be taken to the hall of the pharaohs, there to await his last words and the royal ring. Amid the moonlight, Horus seats himself on the porch, whose steps lead down to the River Nile, and watches the crowds gathering to greet their soon-to-be new pharaoh. As Horus contemplates the reforms that he would like to introduce, something stings his leg; he thinks it was a bee. A courtier remarks that it is fortunate that it was not a spider, whose venom can be deadly at this time of year.\n\nHorus orders edicts drawn up, ordaining peace with Egypt's enemies, the Ethiopians, and forbidding that prisoners of war have their tongues torn out on the field of battle; lowering the people's rents and taxes; giving slaves days of rest and forbidding their caning without a court judgment; recalling Horus' teacher Jethro, whom Ramses had banished for instilling in Horus an aversion to war and compassion for the people; moving, to the royal tombs, the body of Horus' mother Sephora which, because of the mercy that she had shown the slaves, Ramses had buried among the slaves; and releasing Horus' beloved, Berenice, from the cloister where Ramses had imprisoned her.\n\nMeanwhile, Horus' leg has become more painful. The physician examines it and finds that Horus has been stung by a very poisonous spider. He has only a short time to live.\n\nThe ministers enter with the edicts that they have drawn up at his bidding, and Horus awaits the death of Ramses so that he may touch and thus confirm his edicts with the sacred ring of the pharaohs.\n\nAs death approaches Horus, and it becomes increasingly unlikely that he will have time to touch every edict with the ring, he lets successive edicts slip to the floor: the edict on the people's rents and the slaves' labor; the edict on peace with the Ethiopians; the edict moving his mother Sephora's remains; the edict recalling Jethro from banishment; the edict on not tearing out the tongues of prisoners taken in war. There remains only the edict freeing his love, Berenice.\n\nJust then, the high priest's deputy runs into the hall and announces a miracle. Ramses has recovered and invites Horus to join him in a lion hunt at sunrise.\n\nThe inspiration for the short story was investigated in a 1962 paper by the foremost Prus scholar, Zygmunt Szweykowski.\n\nWhat prompted Prus, erstwhile foe of historical fiction, to take time in December 1887, in the midst of writing ongoing newspaper instalments of his second novel, \"The Doll\" (1887–89), to pen his first historical story? What could have moved him so powerfully?\n\nSzweykowski follows several earlier commentators in concluding that it was contemporary German dynastic events. In late October 1887, Germany's first modern emperor, the warlike Kaiser Wilhelm I, had taken cold during a hunt and soon appeared to be at death's door; by November 2 a rumor spread that he had died. He rallied, however. Meanwhile, his son and successor, the -minded Crown Prince Friedrich (in English, \"Frederick\"), an inveterate smoker, had for several months been undergoing treatment for a throat ailment; the foreign press had written of a dire situation, but only on November 12 did the official German press announce that he in fact had throat cancer.\nPrince Frederick had been an object of lively interest among progressive Europeans, who hoped that his eventual reign would bring a broad-based parliamentary system, democratic freedoms, peace, and equal rights for non-German nationalities, including Poles, within the German Empire.\n\nSzweykowski points out that the \"Legend's\" contrast between the despotic centenarian Pharaoh Ramses and his humane grandson and successor Horus was, in its historic German prototypes, doubled, with Prince Frederick actually facing \"two\" antagonists: his father, Kaiser Wilhelm I, and the \"Iron Chancellor\", Otto von Bismarck. In a curious further parallel, a month after Kaiser Wilhelm's illness, Bismarck suffered a stroke.\n\nBolesław Prus, who in his \"Weekly Chronicles\" frequently touched on political events in Germany, devoted much of his December 4, 1887, column to Prince Frederick and his illness. The latest news from Germany and from San Remo, Italy, where the Prince was undergoing treatment, had been encouraging. Prus wrote with relief that \"the Successor to the German Throne reportedly does not have cancer.\" By mid-December, however, the politically inspired optimism in the Berlin press had again yielded to a sense of despair.\n\n\"It was then [states Szweykowski] that Prus wrote 'A Legend of Old Egypt,' shifting a contemporary subject into the past. Prus must have found this maneuver necessary in order to bring to completion what had not yet been completed, avoid sensationalism, and gain perspectives that generalized a particular fact to all human life; the atmosphere of legend was particularly favorable to this.\n\n\"In putting Horus to death while Prince Frederick still lived, Prus anticipated events, but he erred only in details, not in the essence of the matter, which was meant to document the idea that 'human hopes are vain before the order of the world.' Frederick, to be sure, did mount the throne (as Frederick III) in March the following year (Kaiser Wilhelm I died on March 9, 1888) and for a brief time it seemed that a new era would begin for Germany, and indirectly for Europe.\"\n\nBut it was not to be. Frederick III survived his father by only 99 days, dying at Potsdam on June 15, 1888, and leaving the German throne to his bellicose son Wilhelm II, who a quarter-century later would help launch World War I.\n\nThe connection between the German dynastic events and the genesis of Prus' \"Legend of Old Egypt\" was recognized in the Polish press already in 1888, even before Frederick's accession to short-lived impotent power, by a pseudonymous writer who styled himself \"Logarithmus.\"\n\nAs Szweykowski observes, \"the direct connection between the short story and political events in contemporaneous Germany doubtless opens new suggestions for the genesis of \"Pharaoh\".\"\n\nIn addition to the German elements, there were other influences on the composition of the short story. These included:\n\nFor Prus it was axiomatic that historical fiction must distort history. Characteristically, at times, in historical fiction, his choices of characters' names show considerable arbitrariness: nowhere more so than in \"A Legend of Old Egypt.\" \n\n\"A Legend of Old Egypt,\" published in 1888, shows unmistakable kinships in setting, theme and denouement with Prus' 1895 novel \"Pharaoh\", for which the short story served as a preliminary sketch.\n\nBoth works of fiction are set in ancient Egypt — the \"Legend,\" at some indeterminate time, presumably during the 19th or 20th Dynasty, when all the Ramesside pharaohs reigned; \"Pharaoh\", at the fall of the 20th Dynasty and New Kingdom in the 11th century BCE.\n\nIn each, the protagonist (Horus, and Ramses XIII, respectively) aspires to introduce social reforms. (Ramses also plans preventive war against a rising Assyrian power.)\n\nIn each, the protagonist perishes before he can implement his plans — though, in the novel, some of these are eventually realized by Ramses' adversary and successor, Herihor.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1827701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827701", "title": "Fauj-i-Khas", "text": "Fauj-i-Khas\n\nThe Fauj-i-Khas was a brigade of the Fauj-i-Ain section of the Sikh Khalsa Army of Punjab. It consisted of very experienced elites and had separate flag and emblem. It was strictly disciplined on French pattern. All the equipment and weapons were of the best type. It grew to be the best organised section of the regular army (Fauj-i-Ain)\n\nBefore the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh the armies in Punjab were consisting purely of cavalry. As Ranjit Singh became the Sardar of Sukerchakia Misl he tried to unify with his conquests most of the Punjab. With clever diplomacy and many battles he gradually unified most of Punjab under him. However the Afghans, The British and the Gurkhas were still a very big threat, while his empire was still in its infancy. Therefore, in 1805,he started recruiting regular forces and employing East India Company deserters as officers or soldiers. This didn't went very well as most of these deserters were constantly in touch with the British. The British where alarmed with the rapid conquests of Ranjit Singh and sent many diplomatic missions to help the Phulkian sardars from a possible conquest of their lands and check the growing power of the Sikh Sovereign.\n\nA Muslim regiment under Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe was sent to Amritsar for talks with the Maharaja. The soldiers created noise through their chants as they approached Ranjit Singh’s fort in Amritsar and passed near the Golden Temple and caused an irregular detachment of Nihang guards to inquire about the disturbances during prayer, before they were challenged by the Muslim soldiers who fired upon them. The Sikh Nihangs shot off many Musket and matchlock volleys rather than a sword charge. It resulted in the death of many of Metcalfe's escorts, while others were wounded. This impressed Ranjit Singh and left a deep impact on him, as the Nihangs had quickly adopted the line formations of Metcalfe's escorts and then shot off their volleys. The Maharaja then accepted The Treaty of Amritsar (1809), and saw the British as allies for the moment as he took the British refusal to engage after the assault on Metcalfe's convoy as well as the Sikh army's frequent unanswered incursions and attacks south of the Sutlej on British army officers in Ludhiana as signs of weakness on the British's part.\nIt was the Maharaja Ranjit Singh who started to hire European officers to train and command parts of his army. The Fauj-i-Khas was a model brigade trained and equipped after European model under the command of General Jean-Baptiste Ventura. It consisted of 11000 horsemen(Ghor Charras), divided into fifteen Dera led by eminent sardars, among them Sham Singh Atariwala, Gurmukh Singh Lamba, Hari Singh Nalwa, and two by non Sikhs, the Mulraj Derah of Dewan Mulraj and Dorgra Derah of Dhian Dogra. Izazi-i-sardari was the highest honour, most distinguished Sikh generals, sardar Gurmukh Singh Lamba, Hari Singh Nalwa, and Dal Singh Nahama were the recipient.\nThe Fauj-i-Khas had its own Flag,with the Punjabi inscription of the motto of the Sikh Khalsa Army:\"Deg Tegh Fateh.It had also many banners,all of them blue in colour with circles,horses,flowers and corn plants\n\nThe \"Fauj-i-Khas\" had 4 battalions of infantry, 2 regiments of cavalry and a troop of artillery. The cavalry was built on a British model and the infantry on French pattern. This was the first unit in the army to be equipped European-style. Impressed by its performance, the Maharaja ordered a total reorganisation of his whole regular force on the model of Fauj-i-Khas in 1835. This alarmed the British, who had come to see the emerging military power of Punjab as a threat, to such a degree that they in 1837 issued orders \"to be vigilant and try to arrest any French officer travelling in disguise to join Ranjit Singh’s army.\"\nBefore Ranjit Singh, the Punjab army was mainly a pure cavalry army. Under the supervision of the European officers, and encouragement by the Maharaja, the infantry and artillery gained importance, and by the time of the death of Ranjit Singh, the infantry service had become the preferred service in the army.\n\nOver the years many Europeans served in the army of the Punjab.

{"id": "1827706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827706", "title": "Hurricane Edna", "text": "Hurricane Edna\n\nHurricane Edna was a deadly and destructive major hurricane that impacted the United States East Coast in September of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season. It was one of two hurricanes to strike Massachusetts in that year, the other being Hurricane Carol. The fifth tropical cyclone and storm of the season, as well as the fourth hurricane and second major hurricane, Edna developed from a tropical wave on September 2. Moving towards the north-northwest, Edna skirted the northern Leeward Islands as a tropical depression before turning more towards the west. The depression attained tropical storm status to the east of Puerto Rico and strengthened further to reach hurricane status by September 7. The storm rapidly intensified and reached its peak intensity of 125 mph (205 km/h) north of the Bahamas before weakening to Category 2 status near landfall in Massachusetts on September 11. Edna transitioned into an extratropical cyclone in Atlantic Canada before its remnants dissipated in the northern Atlantic.\n\nEdna caused 20 fatalities throughout its lifetime as a tropical cyclone, as well as a moderate amount of damage. It first caused rainfall-induced flooding in Puerto Rico, and it later brushed the Bahamas. High waves affected the coastline of North Carolina. Edna resulted in the heaviest day of rainfall in New York City in 45 years, while strong waves cut off Montauk from the remainder of Long Island. There were six highway deaths in the state, and $1.5 million in crop damage. There were widespread evacuations in southern New England, after Hurricane Carol struck the same area only 11 days prior. Strong winds caused extensive power outages for 260,000 people, including nearly all of Cape Cod. Edna became the costliest hurricane in the history of Maine, where the hurricane caused flooding that washed out roads and rail lines. There were 21 deaths in New England, eight of whom in Maine due to drownings. Later, high winds severely damaged crops in Atlantic Canada.\n\nHurricane Edna originated in an easterly tropical wave which modern research has estimated to have spawned a tropical depression east of the Caribbean Sea on September 2, 1954. The low pressure area was not observed in real time until several days later, on September 5, while situated between Puerto Rico and The Bahamas. Near the disturbance, a ship reported heavy squalls and wind gusts to . Additionally, the island of Puerto Rico experienced torrential rainfall in association with the storm. Operationally, the system was not recognized to have organized into a tropical cyclone until September 6; it is listed in the Atlantic hurricane database as achieving tropical storm intensity early on September 4. Edna proceeded west-northwestward, bypassing Hispaniola to the north, and by September 7 it had strengthened into a minimal hurricane on the present-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.\n\nInitially a rather small storm in terms of physical size, the hurricane steadily intensified throughout the day. Reconnaissance aircraft flew into the storm frequently to take observations on the cyclone's structure. The center of circulation passed near San Salvador Island, and on September 8, Edna further strengthened into a Category 3 major hurricane while broadly curving northward. Reconnaissance flights indicated a maturing and evolving eye, approximately in diameter. The overall circulation increased in size as banding features became more well-defined. The storm reached its peak winds of and maintained them for over two days. However, reconnaissance data was at times inconsistent and inaccurate, leading to suspicious and unlikely jogs in the storm's track. The cause of these errors is attributed to misinterpretation of radar information.\n\nMidday on September 9, while tracking nearly due north, Edna's minimum central barometric pressure fell to , but is believed to have leveled off shortly thereafter. The radius of hurricane-force winds increased, and the storm may have become asymmetrical, with convection concentrated to the right of the center, although this was not confirmed due to a lack of data. An approaching weak frontal boundary spread overcast conditions over the Eastern Seaboard north of North Carolina. By September 10, Edna was located just south of Cape Hatteras, passing east of the Outer Banks early the next day. As the hurricane accelerated to the northeast, it began to deteriorate and weaken. Closely following the recent track of Hurricane Carol, Edna approached New England, but diverged from Carol's track upon skirting the eastern coast instead of moving inland. Weather reporting stations in the Mid-Atlantic States reported rapid clearing as the storm gained latitude, while heavy rain and gusty winds enveloped New England. On September 11, Edna passed directly over Cape Cod after weakening to Category 2 status, although surface weather analysis depicted a central pressure of . It subsequently tracked just east of Eastport, Maine. The storm continued northeastward into Atlantic Canada and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, although the exact time of this transition is unknown. The storm's extratropical remnants reemerged into the northern Atlantic after crossing eastern Canada and were last noted on September 15.\n\nIn advance of the storm, hurricane warnings were issued for parts of The Bahamas and South Florida, as winds of up to hurricane force were expected. Farther to the north, storm warnings were posted from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to Eastport, Maine. Along the coast of North Carolina and the Virginia Capes, where gale-force winds and high tides were expected, residents were advised to take precautions. In New York City, it was to be considered \"a miracle\" if Edna did not strike the area directly, and the storm was predicted to be one of the most severe hurricanes in the history of the New York Weather Bureau. In the 24 hours before the storm struck, New York Telephone received 361,392 calls, which was the third highest volume the company ever recorded. In the Montauk area, 500 residents evacuated their homes by early September 11, while all businesses closed in Westerly, Rhode Island. Businesses in Providence, which was flooded during Hurricane Carol, prepared sandbags to mitigate flooding. Most beach homes had closed for the summer season, and hundreds of people who lived along the southern New England coast evacuated. Other threatened areas were evacuated, including Milford, Connecticut, where 3,000 families left their homes. Sirens alerted other residents to remain indoors and drivers to stay off the highways. Along the coast of Connecticut, bus and train service was halted. A state of emergency was declared in New London, and mail service was canceled in some areas. On September 10, the Navy ordered the evacuation of hundreds of warships and aircraft. Coast Guard planes evacuated from Rhode Island and Massachusetts. About 40 Red Cross shelters, which were opened during Hurricane Carol 11 days prior, were reopened to provide food. Officers at Fort Devens sent 40 trucks with cots, blankets, and generators to areas expected to be struck by the storm. Advance warning was credited with a lower death toll in Edna than Carol.\n\nOn September 7, a bulletin from San Juan, Puerto Rico reported extensive, flood-inducing rainfall along the western and southern coasts of the island. Over of precipitation fell within a two-day period. The easternmost islands of The Bahamas, including San Salvador, experienced gale-force winds and high seas.\n\nEdna's path near North Carolina was about east of Carol. Winds blew at up to along the shore, accompanied by strong surf, although no fatalities or major property damage resulted from the storm. Tides at Norfolk, Virginia were only slightly above normal during the storm's passage to the east, and winds were moderate in strength. Peripheral rainfall in Maryland and Delaware eased drought conditions. In coastal New Jersey, northwesterly winds reached , and Long Branch received around of rainfall. Further north, Long Island also suffered moderate to strong winds, blowing from the north at their peak. A Weather Bureau station in New York City recorded winds midday on September 11. Rainfall reached in the city, becoming the wettest day in 45 years. The storm cut off Montauk Point on eastern Long Island at its height, prompting the Coast Guard to temporarily relocate 500 families. Rainfall in Suffolk County amounted to . Crop damage in New York was estimated at $1.5 million, and six people died in the city due to highway deaths.\n\nWhen Edna struck New England, it was moving quickly to the northeast at . It struck eastern Massachusetts about east of where Hurricane Carol struck only a week prior. Hurricane-force winds affected much of the coastline, with peak gusts of on Martha's Vineyard offshore Massachusetts, and on Block Island offshore Rhode Island. Along the coast, wind gusts peaked at at Hyannis, Massachusetts. The high winds caused widespread power outages, including for nearly all of Cape Cod. The storm surge reached along the Massachusetts coast, causing flooding and heavy boating damage. Further west, there was lesser coastal flooding, although heavy rainfall after previously wet conditions caused urban and stream flooding; rainfall peaked at around . Damage in Connecticut and Rhode Island was mainly in areas already affected by Hurricane Carol. Several streets were washed out, and rivers rose above flood stage.\n\nDamage was heaviest in Maine, estimated at $25 million, which made Edna the costliest hurricane in the state's history. Strong wind gusts, reaching , and heavy rainfall, peaking at , extended into the state; these were considered the heaviest rains in the state in 58 years. The Androscoggin and Kennebec rivers both reached above-normal levels, causing flooding and washing out roads. In Augusta, the Kennebec River reached , which was above the peak level after the spring snow melt. Flooding entered basements, affected fields, and covered bridges. In West Peru, the floods washed out a bridge that was under construction. In addition, the winds downed trees, which blocked widespread roads and caused power outages in 18% of the state. Washed out roads and rail lines cut off the state from the rest of New England. In Lewiston, a trapped car in deep waters required rescue by boat. Another stranded family was rescued after seven hours in Unity, in which one child and a rescuer were killed. There were eight deaths in the state, most of whom related to cars being swept away by floods.\n\nThere were 21 deaths in New England, including eight drownings in Maine. Throughout the United States, damage was estimated at $42,815,000. Damage was less from Edna than from Carol, primarily due to its strongest winds not occurring at the time of highest tides, and its track farther to the east. Throughout New England, 260,000 people lost power, most of whom in Massachusetts.\n\nWhile rapidly losing characteristics of a tropical cyclone, Edna traversed central New Brunswick. In contrast with the smaller, more compact Hurricane Juan, which struck Atlantic Canada in 2003, Edna was a much larger storm with strong winds extending hundreds of miles from the center. The tightest pressure gradient was focused on the east side of the storm, over mainland Nova Scotia. Edna brought down approximately 700 million board feet of timber, and although the amount of trees the storm destroyed was comparable to that of Juan, its effects were more widespread and not as locally severe. Sustained winds reached at Yarmouth and at Halifax. The intense winds downed power and telephone lines and destroyed many barns; one such structural collapse killed a man, and livestock were lost throughout the region. Other damage to property included several fallen chimneys, a toppled church steeple in Pictou, and roof failures. In Kentville, an apartment building undergoing construction was destroyed. Approximately $3 million CAD in apple crops were decimated, while in Yarmouth, both live lobsters and lobster pots were lost. Debris blocked streets across the province, and at least of road was washed out. Damage in Nova Scotia totaled $6 million CAD: in the aftermath, Yarmouth and Kentville declared states of emergency.\n\nIn New Brunswick, the storm dropped of rain and produced winds of . Wind damage was less significant than in Nova Scotia, although still evident in structures and utility lines. A theatre in McAdam was destroyed, and several people were injured across the area. The storm flooded streets in St. Stephen. About 400 salmon, valued at $10,000 CAD, were lost in Dalhousie. Total damage in the province is estimated at $1.78 million CAD. Elsewhere, power outages were reported in Montreal.\n\nThroughout New England, 20 counties were declared states of emergency. After the storm, Southern New England Telephone sent a crew of 100 workers in 50 trucks to Maine to assist in restoring power. Power was quickly restored, and in some places the outages were less severe than during Carol. For only the third time in its history, the Portland Evening Express was not delivered due to the storm. Most primary roads were re-opened by two days after the storm, although rural areas and rail lines took longer to repair. There was a temporary travel ban for all but emergency vehicles in Maine due to washed out roads. Affecting densely populated portions of the state, Edna struck the day before the governor race between Republican Burton M. Cross and Democratic Edmund Muskie. Before the election, politicians commented how a suppressed turnout as a result of the storm would benefit Muskie, in a state where no Democrat had won governorship since 1934. Muskie ultimately won the election in a close race, which saw a lower turnout than 1950, likely due to Edna suppressing the rural, Republican turnout.\n\nAfter a survey from the Federal Civil Defense Administration described damage as \"tremendous\", President Dwight Eisenhower declared portions of Maine as a disaster area, which allocated federal funding for relief. The president also authorized additional aid to Rhode Island and Massachusetts due to additional damage there from Edna. Due to the severity of the storm, the name \"Edna\" was retired after this usage, for ten years before it was reintroduced for the 1968 season. At the 1969 Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, it was proposed that the names Edna, Carol, and Hazel be permanently retired because of their importance to the research community. Despite the proposal, the name Edna was added to the 1972 naming list, but was ultimately unused.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1827712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827712", "title": "Carissa", "text": "Carissa\n\nCarissa is a genus of shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Australia and Asia. Until recently about 100 species were listed, but most of them have been relegated to the status of synonyms or assigned to other genera, such as \"Acokanthera\".\n\nDifferent species of \"Carissa\" grow as shrubs or trees, attaining respective heights of 2 to 10 m tall. They bear smooth, sharp thorns that often are formidable; they are true botanical thorns, being modified branches, morphologically speaking. The thorns may be simple, as in \"Carissa spinarum\", dichotomously forked as in \"Carissa bispinosa\", or dichotomously branched as in \"Carissa macrocarpa\".\n\nThe leaves are a rich, glossy, waxy green, smooth, simple, entire and elliptic to ovate or nearly lanceolate. They are 2–8 cm long, partly depending on the species, and generally are thick and leathery. In suitable climates some species flower through most of the year. The flowers are nearly sessile, 1–5 cm diameter, with a five-lobed white or pink-tinged corolla. They may be solitary or borne in clusters in an umbel or corymb. The flowers of some species some have a fragrance reminiscent of Gardenia, which adds to their popularity as garden plants. The fruit is a plum-like berry in the shape of a prolate spheroid, like that of a rugby ball. In colour they vary according to species. In some species they are red when ripe, whereas others turn a glossy purple-black. Typically they are 1.5–6 cm in length, and usually contain 1-4 flat brown seeds, but up to 16 in some species.\n\nThe fruit of the carissa is an oblong berry which contains numerous small seeds. The green fruit is poisonous, sometimes dangerously so. The ripe fruit are edible, but may be fairly tart, and they taste like a giant cranberry, though some species have fruity flavours with overtones of strawberry or apple. They are rich in Vitamin C, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus. The fruit of \"C. macrocarpa\" are especially relished and eaten raw or used to make jelly. Various birds eat \"Carissa\" fruit and distribute the seed. If eaten before fully ripe, a bitter, poisonous latex is released from the skin. Other than the ripe fruit, the plant is poisonous, much like the related and dangerously poisonous genus \"Acokanthera\".\n\n\"Carissa carandas\" is grown in several Asiatic countries for its fruit, which is variously used in cooking and in folk medicine (see article).\n\n\"Carissa\" species generally respond well to gardening and are valued in topiary and in forming strong, dense, decorative, thorny, flowering hedges. Some sprawling varieties are useful as ground covers.\n\"Carissa\" species are grown from seed or cuttings and tolerate slight frost.\n\nThe following species are recognised.\n\n"}
{"id": "1827716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827716", "title": "Solow residual", "text": "Solow residual\n\nThe Solow residual is a number describing empirical productivity growth in an economy from year to year and decade to decade. Robert Solow, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences-winning economist, defined rising productivity as rising output with constant capital and labor input. It is a \"residual\" because it is the part of growth that is not accounted for by measures of capital accumulation or increased labor input. Increased physical throughput – i.e. environmental resources – is specifically excluded from the calculation; thus some portion of the residual can be ascribed to increased physical throughput. The example used is for the intracapital substitution of aluminium fixtures for steel during which the inputs do not alter. This differs in almost every other economic circumstance in which there are many other variables. The Solow Residual is procyclical and measures of it are now called the rate of growth of multifactor productivity or total factor productivity, though Solow (1957) did not use these terms.\n\nIn the 1950s, many economists undertook comparative studies of economic growth following World War II reconstruction. Some said that the path to long-term growth was achieved through investment in industry and infrastructure and in moving further and further into capital intensive automated production. Although there was always a concern about diminishing returns to this approach because of equipment depreciation, it was a widespread view of the correct industrial policy to adopt. Many economists pointed to the Soviet command economy as a model of high-growth through tireless re-investment of output in further industrial construction.\n\nHowever, some economists took a different view: they said that greater capital concentrations would yield diminishing returns once the marginal return to capital had equalized with that of labour – and that the apparently rapid growth of economies with high savings rates would be a short-term phenomenon. This analysis suggested that improved labour productivity or total factor technology was the long-run determinant of national growth, and that only under-capitalized countries could grow per-capita income substantially by investing in infrastructure – some of these undercapitalized countries were still recovering from the war and were expected to rapidly develop in this way on a path of convergence with developed nations.\n\nThe Solow residual is defined as per-capita economic growth above the rate of per-capita capital stock growth, so its detection indicates that there must be some contribution to output other than advances in industrializing the economy. The fact that the measured growth in the standard of living, also known as the ratio of output to labour input, could not be explained entirely by the growth in the capital/labour ratio was a significant finding, and pointed to innovation rather than capital accumulation as a potential path to growth.\n\nThe 'Solow growth model' is not intended to explain or derive the empirical residual, but rather to demonstrate how it will affect the economy in the long run when imposed on an aggregate model of the macroeconomy exogenously. This model was really a tool for demonstrating the impact of \"technology\" growth as against \"industrial\" growth rather than an attempt to understand where either type of growth was coming from. The Solow residual is primarily an observation to explain, rather than predict the outcome of a theoretical analysis. It is a question rather than an answer, and the following equations should not obscure that fact.\n\nSolow assumed a very basic model of annual aggregate output over a year (\"t\"). He said that the output quantity would be governed by the amount of capital (the infrastructure), the amount of labour (the number of people in the workforce), and the productivity of that labour. He thought that the productivity of labour was the factor driving long-run GDP increases. An example economic model of this form is given below:\n\nwhere:\n\nTo measure or predict the change in output within this model, the equation above is differentiated in time (\"t\"), giving a formula in partial derivatives of the relationships: labour-to-output, capital-to-output, and productivity-to-output, as shown:\n\nObserve:\n\nSimilarly:\n\nTherefore:\n\nThe growth factor in the economy is a proportion of the output last year, which is given (assuming small changes year-on-year) by dividing both sides of this equation by the output, \"Y\":\n\nThe first two terms on the right hand side of this equation are the proportional changes in labour and capital year-on-year, and the left hand side is the proportional output change. The remaining term on the right, giving the effect of productivity improvements on GDP is defined as the Solow residual:\n\nThe residual, \"SR\"(\"t\") is that part of growth not explicable by measurable changes in the amount of capital, \"K\", and the number of workers, \"L\". If output, capital, and labour all double every twenty years the residual will be zero, but in general it is higher than this: output goes up faster than growth in the input factors. The residual varies between periods and countries, but is almost always positive in peace-time capitalist countries. Some estimates of the post-war U.S. residual credited the country with a 3% productivity increase per-annum until the early 1970s when productivity growth appeared to stagnate.\n\nThe above relation gives a very simplified picture of the economy in a single year; what growth theory econometrics does is to look at a sequence of years to find a statistically significant pattern in the changes of the variables, and perhaps identify the existence and value of the \"Solow residual\". The most basic technique for doing this is to assume constant rates of change in all the variables (obscured by noise), and regress on the data to find the best estimate of these rates in the historical data available (using an Ordinary least squares regression). Economists always do this by first taking the natural log of their equation (to separate out the variables on the right-hand-side of the equation); logging both sides of this production function produces a simple linear regression with an error term, formula_8:\n\nA constant growth factor implies exponential growth in the above variables, so differentiating gives a linear relationship between the growth factors which can be deduced in a simple regression.\n\nIn a regression analysis, the equation one would estimate is:\n\nwhere:\n\n\"y\" is (log) output, ln(Y)\n\n\"k\" is capital, ln(K)\n\n\"ℓ\" is labour, ln(L)\n\n\"C\" can be interpreted as the co-efficient on log(\"A\") – the rate of technological change – (1 − \"α\").\n\nGiven the form of the regression equation, we can interpret the coefficients as elasticities.\n\nFor calculation of the actual quantity/ level of technology formula_11 we simply refer back to our equation in levels.\n\nKnowing quantities of output formula_13, Capital formula_14, Labor formula_15 and estimates for formula_16,formula_17 and formula_18 we can solve for formula_19 as:\n\nMankiw, Romer, and Weil augmented the Solow-Swan model with a human capital term. The explicit inclusion of this term in the model transfers the effect of changes in human capital from the Solow residual to capital accumulation. As a consequence, the Solow residual is smaller in the augmented Solow model:\n\nwhere:\nThe associated regression to estimate this model is:\n\nBreton estimates the Solow residual for the human capital-augmented version of the Solow-Swan model over the 20th century. He finds that from 1910 to 2000 formula_23 in 42 of the world's leading economies increased at an average rate of 1%/year and formula_24 increased at 0.3%/year.\n\nThe Solow residual measures total factor productivity, but the productivity variable is normally attached to the labor variable in the Solow-Swan model to make technological growth labor-augmenting. This type of productivity growth is required mathematically to keep the shares of national income accruing to the factors of production constant over time. These shares appear to have been stable historically in developing nations, and developed nations. However, Thomas Piketty's famous study of inequality in 2014, using a version of the Solow model, argued that a stable, relatively low profit share of national income was largely a twentieth century phenomenon.\n\nRapidly expanding countries (catching up after a crisis or trade liberalization) tend to have a rapid turn-over in technologies as they accumulate capital. It has been suggested that this will tend to make it harder to gain experience with the available technologies and that a zero Solow residual in these cases actually indicates rising labour productivity. In this theory, the fact that \"A\" (labour output productivity) is not falling as new skills become essential indicates that the labour force is capable of adapting, and is likely to have its productivity growth underestimated by the residual—This idea is linked to \"learning-by-doing\".\n\n\n\n"}

Boundary changes in 1997 reduced the Conservative majority from 13,094 to 7,357, and it was 81st on Labour's list of target seats; Labour duly gained it on a 17.1% swing, and since then the Labour MP elected in 1997, Kelvin Hopkins, has held the seat with comfortable majorities.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2015, Luton North was Labour's safest seat in the East of England by both vote and vote share majority; in 2017 it was overtaken in the former count by Norwich South, but the percentage margin in Luton North (30.8% compared to 30.4% in Norwich South) is slightly higher.\n1983–1997: The Borough of Luton wards of Bramingham, Challney, Icknield, Leagrave, Lewsey, Limbury, and Sundon Park, the District of Mid Bedfordshire wards of Flitton and Pulloxhill, Flitwick East, Flitwick West, Harlington, and Westoning, and the District of South Bedfordshire wards of Barton-le-Clay, Streatley, and Toddington.\n\nCreated as a County Constituency formally known as North Luton, incorporating the bulk of the abolished Borough Constituency of Luton West.  Extended northwards to include part of the abolished County Constituency of South Bedfordshire as well as Flitwick, transferred from Mid Bedfordshire.\n\n1997–2010: The Borough of Luton wards of Bramingham, Challney, Icknield, Leagrave, Lewsey, Limbury, Saints, and Sundon Park.\n\nRedesignated as the Borough Constituency of Luton North.

Margaret Moran, who was the Labour MP from 1997, stood down at the 2010 general election after falsifying claims for her expenses.\n\nBellwether status ended in the 2010 general election, when the constituency elected a Labour MP while the Conservatives were the largest party in the House of Commons. As a result, its new MP Gavin Shuker became one of just two Labour MPs elected in 2010 in the East of England, alongside Kelvin Hopkins, the MP for the Luton North seat. Shuker and Hopkins have served as MPs for the two divisions of Luton since then, with their majorities increasing in both elections since, although the majority in South has not been larger than that of North since 2001.\n\n1983–1997: The Borough of Luton wards of Biscot, Crawley, Dallow, Farley, High Town, Putteridge, Saints, South, and Stopsley, and the District of South Bedfordshire wards of Caddington and Slip End.\n\nNew Borough Constituency incorporating the abolished Borough Constituency of Luton East.  Also included southern-most parts of the abolished Borough Constituency of Luton West and small part in the south-east of the abolished County Constituency of South Bedfordshire.\n\n1997–2010: The Borough of Luton wards of Biscott, Crawley, Dallow, Farley, High Town, Putteridge, South, and Stopsley, and the District of South Bedfordshire wards of Caddington and Slip End.\n\nThe Saints ward of the Borough of Luton transferred to Luton North.\n\n2010–present: The Borough of Luton wards of Biscot, Crawley, Dallow, Farley, High Town, Round Green, South, Stopsley, and Wigmore, and the District of South Bedfordshire ward of Caddington, Hyde and Slip End.\n\nMarginal changes due to revision of local authority wards.\n\nNB: the wards of the district of South Bedfordshire now form the bulk of the Caddington ward of the Central Bedfordshire unitary authority, the former wards having been abolished at the conversion to unitary councils in Bedfordshire in 2009.\n\nThe constituency covers the southern and eastern areas of Luton, inclusive of the town centre and London Luton Airport.

The largest community is White British, though Africans and Afro-Caribbeans, as well as newer immigrant arrivals from Eastern Europe, form substantial parts of the population. \nThe town centre features The Mall Luton (the town's main shopping centre), the University of Bedfordshire Luton campus, and various amenities such as The Galaxy entertainment complex, and Luton railway station on the Midland Main Line. Luton Town FC, currently of the Championship, is within the constituency, as would be their intended new home stadium at Power Court (to the immediate east of The Mall Luton).

{"id": "1827749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827749", "title": "Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)", "text": "Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nPeterborough is a borough constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Its current form is the direct, unbroken successor of a smaller constituency that was created in the mid-16th century and used for the legislatures of England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom (UK). The seat today elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first-past-the-post system of election since 1885, before which its earlier form had two-member representation using the similar bloc vote system and both forms had a broadening but restricted franchise until 1918.\n\nThe current MP is Paul Bristow of the Conservative Party, who was elected at the 2019 general election.\n\nThe City of Peterborough formed a parliamentary borough returning two Members in 1541. The rest of the Soke of Peterborough was part of the Northamptonshire parliamentary county; the area south of the River Nene was in the historic county of Huntingdonshire and Thorney was considered part of Cambridgeshire. Until 1832 when the whole of the parish of Saint John the Baptist was encompassed, the boundary, as far as is known, excluded the villages of Longthorpe, Dogsthorpe and Newark with Eastfield. The Great Reform Act did not affect the borough, while the rural portion of the Soke was included in the Northern division of Northamptonshire. Under the Boundaries Act 1868, New Fletton and Woodstone were transferred from Huntingdonshire and, under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, the borough's representation was reduced from two to one MP.\n\nIn 1918 the parliamentary borough was abolished and replaced with a new division of the parliamentary county of Northampton with the Soke of Peterborough,\nincluding the whole of the Soke (which had been created as a separate administrative county by the Local Government Act 1888) and neighbouring parts of the administrative county of Northamptonshire, absorbing the bulk of the abolished Northern division, incorporating Oundle and extending down to and beyond Thrapston and Corby. This became a county constituency under the revisions brought in for the 1950 general election by the Representation of the People Act 1948, with only minor changes to the boundaries of the constituency to reflect a rationalisation of the rural districts of Northamptonshire.\n\nThe composition of the constituency from 1918 onwards is shown in the table below.\n\nIn 1965 the administrative counties of the Soke of Peterborough and Huntingdonshire were combined to form Huntingdon and Peterborough. At the next redistribution, which came into effect for the February 1974 general election, the constituency was redesignated as a Borough Constituency, composed of the local authorities which had comprised the Soke, together with the small Rural District of Thorney, which was transferred from the administrative county/county constituency of Isle of Ely. The parts in Northamptonshire were transferred to the county constituency of Wellingborough.\n\nMeanwhile, as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, the two counties of Huntingdon and Peterborough and Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely were merged to form the non-metropolitan county of Cambridgeshire, with effect from 1 April 1974. However, the next redistribution did not come into effect until the 1983 general election, when areas to the south of the River Nene, including Fletton and the Ortons, which were now part of the expanded City of Peterborough, were transferred from the abolished County Constituency of Huntingdonshire. Mainly rural areas to the east (Thorney and Eye) and west (Barnack and Werrington) were transferred respectively to the new County Constituencies of North East Cambridgeshire and Huntingdon.\n\nThe next redistribution, which came into effect for the 1997 general election, saw the creation of the County Constituency of North West Cambridgeshire, which took the areas to the south of the River Nene (City of Peterborough wards of Fletton, Orton Longueville, Orton Waterville and Stanground). Werrington was transferred back from the Huntingdon constituency. Following their review of parliamentary representation in Cambridgeshire in 2005, the Boundary Commission for England made minor alterations to the existing constituencies to deal with population changes, including the transfer back of Thorney and Eye from North East Cambridgeshire. There were also marginal changes to take account of the redistribution of City of Peterborough wards. These changes increased the electorate from 64,893 to 70,640. On the enumeration date of 17 February 2000, the electoral quota for England was 69,934 voters per constituency.\n\nThe current constituency is composed of built-up areas of Peterborough to the north of the River Nene, as well as rural areas to the east and north and comprises approximately 60% of the electorate of the local authority of the City of Peterborough. Remaining parts of the City, composed of residential areas to the south of the River Nene and rural areas to the west of Peterborough (wards of Barnack, Fletton, Glinton and Wittering, Northborough, Orton Longueville, Orton Waterville, Orton with Hampton, Stanground Central, and Stanground East) form part of the North West Cambridgeshire constituency.\n\nIn the unreformed House of Commons to be either a candidate or an elector for a county seat, a man had to own (not rent) freehold property valued for the land tax at two pounds a year (women could neither vote nor stand for election). This was known as the 40/- freehold. The franchise for borough seats varied enormously. Originally in Peterborough the dean and chapter had claimed the franchise and held that only residents of Minster Precincts were burgesses. By the interregnum, the city was one of 37 boroughs in which suffrage was restricted to those paying scot and lot, a form of municipal taxation. In 1800 there were 2,000 registered voters in Northamptonshire and 400 in Peterborough. By 1835 this was 576, or about one per cent of the population. Bribery was general until the introduction of the secret ballot under the Ballot Act 1872. Votes were cast by spoken declaration, in public, at the hustings, erected on the Market Place (now Cathedral Square).\n\nIn 1832 the Great Reform Act enfranchised those who owned or leased land worth £10 or more and the Second Reform Act extended this to all householders paying £10 or more in rent per annum, effectively enfranchising the skilled working class, so by 1868 the percentage of voters in Peterborough had risen to about 20% of the population. The Third Reform Act extended the provisions of the previous act to the counties and the Fourth Reform Act widened suffrage further by abolishing practically all property qualifications for men and by enfranchising women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. This system, known as universal manhood suffrage, was first used in the 1918 general election. However, full electoral equality wouldn't occur until the Fifth Reform Act ten years later.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census, the population count of Peterborough constituency is 95,103 persons, comprising 46,131 males and 48,972 females. 67.56% of those aged 16–74 are economically active, including 5.92% unemployed; a further 12.26% are retired and 3.08% students. Of a total 39,760 households, 63.80% are owner occupied, fewer than the regional (72.71%) and national (68.72%) averages. Turnout at the 2005 general election was 41,194 or 61.0% of those eligible to vote, below the regional (63.6%) and national (61.3%) figures.\n\nPeterborough sent two members to parliament for the first time in 1547. Before the civil war, many were relatives of the clergy; then for two hundred years after the restoration there was always a Fitzwilliam, or a Fitzwilliam nominee, sitting as member for Peterborough, making it a Whig stronghold. Representation was reduced to one member under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.\n\nOne of the earliest incumbents, Sir Walter Mildmay, member for Peterborough from 1553 to 1554, subsequently became Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1559 to 1589. Later, in the nineteenth century, William Elliot, Whig member from 1802 until his death in 1819, was Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland between 1806 and 1807; the Hon. William Lamb (later the 2nd Viscount Melbourne), Whig member from 1816 to 1819, became Home Secretary in 1830 then Prime Minister from 1834 to 1841; and Sir James Scarlett (later the 1st Baron Abinger), Whig member from 1819 to 1830, was, from 1827, Attorney General for England and Wales.\n\nFrom the formal merger of the breakaway Liberal Unionists with the Conservatives in 1912 and the absorption of rural North Northamptonshire in 1918, Peterborough has been predominantly Conservative; however, it has elected Labour MPs several times from 1929 onwards.\n\nLord Burghley, as he then was, succeeded the socialist writer and illustrator, Frank Horrabin, who was born in the city and elected under the leadership of Ramsay MacDonald in 1929. David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter, winner of 400m hurdles at the 1928 Summer Olympics, member of the International Olympic Committee for 48 years and chairman of the organising committee of the 1948 Summer Olympics, was the Conservative member from 1931 to 1943.\n\nIn 1966, in one of the closest polls in UK history, Sir Harmar Nicholls held the seat by three votes after seven recounts. Nicholls was the Conservative member from 1950 to 1974, when he lost in the October election of that year to Labour's Michael Ward, having held on by just 22 votes after four recounts in the election eight months earlier. The growth in the New Town from 1967 may in part account for Labour's victory here in 1974. In 1979, however, Ward lost the seat to the Conservative Brian Mawhinney, who would represent Peterborough for the entire duration of the incoming Conservative government and was a Cabinet Minister and Conservative Party Chairman during the second Major government (1992–97).\n\nThe seat was made more competitive in the 1997 boundary review by the formation of the North West Cambridgeshire seat, which incorporated the rural land outside Peterborough and several Conservative-inclined wards from the city. Since its formation, North West Cambridgeshire has been one of the safest Conservative seats in the country, whilst Peterborough was ranked 93rd in the Conservatives's one hundred most vulnerable seats (the ones which the other parties must take if there is to be a change of government) and 73rd on Labour's target list; these factors led Mawhinney to stand in North West Cambridgeshire instead. He retired as an MP in 2005 and was created Baron Mawhinney, of Peterborough in the county of Cambridgeshire.\n\nHelen Clark (née Brinton) won the seat for Labour in 1997. She was defeated by Conservative candidate Stewart Jackson at the 2005 election, following which it was widely reported that Clark was planning to defect to the Conservative Party, an announcement which was not popular locally. However, by early June it emerged that while she had left the Labour Party, she had not in fact joined the Conservatives and did not intend to.\n\nJackson was re-elected in 2010 with an increased majority, which then fell in 2015. In 2017, Labour's Fiona Onasanya won a majority of 607; this result marked the first time since 1929 that Peterborough voted Labour in an election where the Conservatives won the national popular vote, and the first time it has ever elected a Labour MP in a year in which Labour did not form the government. Furthermore, Peterborough became one of five constituencies – the others being Croydon Central, Enfield Southgate, Leeds North West and Reading East – which elected Labour MPs in 2017 having not done so since 2001.\n\nThe Tories (or Abhorrers) and Whigs (or Petitioners) originated in the Court and Country parties that emerged in the aftermath of the civil war, although it is more accurate to describe them as loose tendencies, both of which might be regarded as conservative in modern terms. Modern party politics did not really begin to coalesce in Great Britain until at least 1784.\nIn 1832 the Tory Party evolved into the Conservative Party and in 1859 the Whig Party evolved, with Radicals and Peelites, into the Liberal Party. In opposition to Irish home rule, the Liberal Unionists ceded from the Liberals in 1886, aligning themselves with the Conservatives. The Labour Party was later founded, as the Labour Representation Committee, in 1900.\nThe parliamentary borough of Peterborough was abolished under the Representation of the People Act 1918, and the name was transferred to a division of the new parliamentary county of Northampton with the Soke of Peterborough. The Peterborough division became a county constituency in 1950.\n\nPeterborough was redefined as a borough constituency with effect from the February 1974 general election. Successors of the historic parliamentary boroughs, the spending limits for election campaigns are slightly lower than in county constituencies.\n\nOnasanya sat as an independent after she was suspended by the Labour Party in December 2018. The seat became vacant on 1 May 2019 following a successful recall petition, until 7 June 2019, when Lisa Forbes was elected to the constituency in the 2019 Peterborough by-election, on behalf of the Labour Party.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGeneral Election 1939/40\nAnother general election was required to take place before the end of 1940. The political parties had been making preparations for an election to take place from 1939 and by the end of this year, the following candidates had been selected:\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n"}

The municipality covers an area of 640 km², and has a total population of 87,781 (2008). Its mayor is Jørn Pedersen, a member of the Liberal Party (\"Venstre\") political party. The main city and the site of its municipal council is the seaport city of Kolding, the sixth largest city in Denmark.\n\nTo the east is a strait, first called \"Snævringen\" (\"The Narrowing\") and then further south \"Bredningen\" (\"The Broadening\"), that separates the Jutland mainland from the island of Funen in this area, where the two lie very close to each other, often less than 1.5 km apart. \"Snævringen\" is an extension of the Kattegat, and begins near the cities of Fredericia and Middelfart, north and east of Kolding municipality. As \"Snævringen\" broadens it becomes \"Bredningen\", which opens out into the Little Belt (\"Lillebælt\"), the main strait between Jutland and Funen. The municipality of Middelfart on the other side of \"Snævringen\" is thus Kolding's municipal neighbor to the east. The island of Fænø lies in \"Snævringen\" between Kolding and Middelfart.\n\nLeading directly into the city of Kolding from \"Snævringen\" are the waters of Kolding Fjord.\n\nSeveral major Danish motorways intersect in Kolding municipality.

{"id": "1827752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827752", "title": "Emotions (Mariah Carey song)", "text": "Emotions (Mariah Carey song)\n\n\"Emotions\" is a song by American singer Mariah Carey from her second studio album \"Emotions\" (1991). It was written and produced by Carey, Robert Clivillés and David Cole of C+C Music Factory, and released as the album's lead single on August 13, 1991. The song's lyrics has its protagonist going through a variety of emotions, from high to low, up to the point where she declares \"you got me feeling emotions\". Musically, it is heavily influenced by 1970s disco music, and showcases Carey's upper range and extensive use of the whistle register.\n\nCarey was sent to work with the C+C Music Factory and they composed the song \"You're So Cold\", which became the first choice for the album's first single. However, a second session with the production team had them feeling in a lighter mood when \"Emotions\" was created and finally decided upon as the lead single.\n\n\"Emotions\" is a disco song, and is written in the key of A minor with a tempo of 115 beats per minute. Carey's vocal range spans more than four octaves on the track, from C to E, with the highest note being sung with arpeggios. The sheet music of the song has a 8va marking on the last part of the song. It was later publicly revealed that the track borrowed from Maurice White's Best of My Love, written for the band The Emotions. This situation led to an out-of-court settlement between both sides.\n\nThe single's music video, directed by Jeff Preiss, features Carey and friends with exotic animals while partying and having fun around town in New York City. The video was desaturated but still maintains various color tints, which change from brown to red to blue and so forth.\n\nDavid Cole and Robert Clivillés created the main remix of \"Emotions\" known as \"Emotions\" (12\" Club Mix). Although Carey did not re-record her vocals for it, she added a new gospel-style intro before the song's dance portion. This new intro was used when she performed \"Emotions\" on \"MTV Unplugged\" in 1992, as well as at some later concerts. A music video was created using the 12\" club mix, but only slight changes in editing differentiate it from the video for the original version. The remix was later featured on Carey's 2003 remix album \"The Remixes\".\n\n\"Emotions\" received positive reviews from critics. \n\n\"Emotions\" was nominated for the 1992 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, losing to \"Something to Talk About\" by Bonnie Raitt. It won a BMI R&B Award, continuing Carey's unbroken streak of wins for this award. Carey was also nominated for Producer of the Year (non-classical), becoming the second woman to achieve this honor.\n\n\"Emotions\" became Carey's fifth consecutive number one hit on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100, giving her the distinction of being the first (and, to date, only) act to have their first five singles make number 1 on the Hot 100. (She had previously shared a record of four with The Jackson 5.) It reached number 1 in its seventh week and spent three weeks at the top, from October 12 to 26, 1991. It replaced \"Good Vibrations\" by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch featuring Loleatta Holloway, and was replaced by Karyn White's \"Romantic\". It remained in the top 40 for 20 weeks and was one of four singles from Carey on the Hot 100's 1991 year-end charts, ranking 22. The song topped the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and became her second number 1 single on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. The RIAA certified it Platinum in 2019.\n\nOutside the U.S., it was Carey's most successful single since \"Vision of Love\" (1990), the lead single from her debut album. It reached the top five in Canada and New Zealand, and became her first single to reach the United Kingdom top 20 since her debut. It was a modest hit in Australia, where it just missed the top ten, but its success in Europe was limited.\n\nCarey performed \"Emotions\" live for the first time at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards, backed by several male and female back up vocalists. Following the award show appearance, she sang \"Emotions\" on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\", airing on September 23, 1991.\n\nCarey opened every show with \"Emotions\" during her Music Box Tour in 1993, Daydream World Tour in 1996, Butterfly World Tour in 1998, and Rainbow World Tour in 2000. However, she omitted the second verse in it when performing the song during the Rainbow World Tour.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, 2009, Carey sang \"Emotions\" on the first night of her Angels Advocate Tour (2009-2010).

Upon this act, it took up the western division of the county; however, later seats such as South West Hertfordshire, established in 1950, have reduced its reach, as settlements in those areas, and Watford itself, have grown.\n\nThe seat has been a bellwether of the national result since February 1974, and since 1945 has only voted against the winning party twice: in 1951 and 1970. Watford saw considerable Liberal Democrat opposition in 2005, achieving second place, taking many Labour votes with the Conservative candidate close behind.\n\nBefore the 2010 general election it was a three-way marginal seat in which local Tories, Labour supporters and Liberal Democrats aimed to garner support for their candidate. This election in Watford was won by Richard Harrington (Con) with 34.9% of the vote. The Liberal Democrats narrowly missed out on the seat with 32.4% of the vote and the defeat for Labour's candidate, Claire Ward, was a pronounced change with 26.7% of the vote.\n\nIn 2015, the result saw a significantly increased majority for Harrington of more than 9,000 votes over Labour, whilst the Liberal Democrats fell back to third. The 2017 election saw Labour significantly cut the Conservative majority to 2,092.\n\nDennis Herbert was Deputy Speaker from 1931 to 1943.\n\nMajor John Freeman was only a third-tier (junior) minister in the War Office as MP. His later unusually prominent positions in diplomacy led to his being appointed a member of the Privy Council and thereby being Rt Hon as of 1966.\n\nTristan Garel-Jones was Minister for Europe for three years of the Major ministry.\n\nBoth Herbert and Garel-Jones opted as peers in later life to use \"Watford\" as the territorial designation of their peerages.\n\nWatford has a considerable service sector economy, with several notable headquarters, and engineering, trade-craft and distribution in its economy, however is also a commuter town to the City of London. British Waterways, J D Wetherspoon, Camelot Group, Iveco, manufacturers of commercial vehicles; part of Balfour Beatty; Bathstore, the largest bathroom retailer in the UK; construction firm Taylor Woodrow; and Mothercare are the largest of these. The borough is also the UK base of many multinationals including C. H. Robinson, Total Oil, TK Maxx, Costco, Vinci and Beko appliances.

Two of the Three Rivers wards, Carpenders Park and Oxhey Hall, are to the south of Watford town and include mostly prosperous, elevated, commuter villages. The remaining three, Abbots Langley, Langleybury and Leavesden, are to the north of Watford, the first of which is a large village, and is mixed in character and levels of income.\n\nIn July 2007 former candidate Ali Miraj, a candidate for Aberavon in 2001, was dropped from the candidates list by the Conservative party after he complained about David Cameron's leadership style and allegedly demanded a peerage. The public selected his former campaign manager Ian Oakley, who had been a candidate for Newport East in 2001 in the first Open Primary to be organised by the Conservative Party in November 2006. In July 2008, Oakley, withdrew candidature after being arrested for conducting a campaign of harassment against the local Liberal Democrats, for which he was convicted and given an 18-week suspended prison sentence and 12-month supervision order on 13 October 2008.\n\nIn December 2008 Watford Conservative Association selected a new candidate, Richard Harrington.\n\nGeneral Election 1914/15:\n\nAnother General Election was required to take place before the end of 1915.

Its electorate was reduced for the 1983 general election when Billericay was re-established. It underwent a major redistributions for the 1997 election and again for the 2010 election, when it was renamed as South Basildon and East Thurrock.\n\nIt was one of the best known bellwether constituencies in Britain, having voted for the winning party in each election for the duration of its existence. The failure of the Labour Party to win it in the 1992 election — Basildon would be the first to declare of all the marginal seats — foreshadowed Labour's fourth straight defeat at the hands of the Conservative Party.\n\n1974–1983: The Urban District of Basildon.\n\nFormed from part of the abolished County Constituency of Billericay, comprising the former Urban District thereof, which had been reconstituted as the Urban District of Basildon.\n\n1983–1997: The District of Basildon wards of Fryerns Central, Fryerns East, Langdon Hills, Lee Chapel North, Nethermayne, Pitsea East, Pitsea West, and Vange.\n\nNorthern parts, including Billericay and Wickford transferred to the re-established constituency of Billericay.\n\n1997–2010: The District of Basildon wards of Fryerns Central, Fryerns East, Langdon Hills, Lee Chapel North, Nethermayne, and Vange, and the Borough of Thurrock wards of Corringham and Fobbing, Orsett, Stanford-le-Hope, and The Homesteads.\n\nMajor realignment of boundaries with Billericay; Pitsea was transferred to Billericay in exchange for the northern part of the Borough of Thurrock.\n\nFollowing their review of parliamentary representation in Essex, the Boundary Commission for England made radical changes to all parliamentary constituencies in the county for the 2010 general election, and the Basildon constituency was divided. The majority of the seat formed the basis of the new South Basildon and East Thurrock constituency, while the wards around central Basildon were merged with the bulk of the former Billericay constituency to form a new seat called Basildon and Billericay.\n\nBasildon was a (famously) Conservative seat between 1979 and 1997 as the quintessential \"Essex man\" constituency based on the new town of Basildon. Much of its population has its origins in the East End of London, who as a group traditionally voted for the Labour Party.\n\nHowever, throughout the 1980s and until the Labour landslide victory of 1997, many voters in the area transferred their loyalties to the Conservative Party. The MP throughout that period was David Amess, who himself originated from east London (Plaistow), and now holds the safer seat of Southend West.\n\nLabour took the seat in 1997 and 2001 with a large majority, and in 2005 with a reduced majority. Basildon thus proved to be a \"bellwether\" seat, voting for the eventual winning party since 1974.\n\nBoth the successor seats that replaced Basildon in 2010 were considered to be much less favourable to Labour than the old Basildon seat, ending Basildon's bellwether status.\n\nNote: This constituency underwent boundary changes after the 1979 election, so was notionally a Labour seat.\n\nDue to constituency boundary changes between 1992 and 1997, the changes in percentage of vote share in 1997 are given relative to the notional 1992 results, which reflect what the results would have been in 1992 had the election been fought with the 1997 boundaries.\n\n"}

It was completed in May 1983, as the final part of a series based on the mathematical catastrophe theory of René Thom.\n\nThom suggested that in four-dimensional phenomena, there are seven possible equilibrium surfaces, and therefore seven possible discontinuities, or \"elementary catastrophes\": fold, cusp, swallowtail, butterfly, hyperbolic umbilic, elliptic umbilic, and parabolic umbilic. \"The shape of Dalí’s Swallow’s Tail is taken directly from Thom’s four-dimensional graph of the same title, combined with a second catastrophe graph, the s-curve that Thom dubbed, 'the cusp'. Thom’s model is presented alongside the elegant curves of a cello and the instrument’s f-holes, which, especially as they lack the small pointed side-cuts of a traditional f-hole, equally connote the mathematical symbol for an integral in calculus: ∫.\"\n\nIn his 1979 speech, \"Gala, Velázquez and the Golden Fleece\", presented upon his 1979 induction into the prestigious Académie des Beaux-Arts of the Institut de France, Dalí described Thom's theory of catastrophes as \"the most beautiful aesthetic theory in the world\". He also recollected his first and only meeting with René Thom, at which Thom purportedly told Dalí that he was studying tectonic plates; this provoked Dalí to question Thom about the railway station at Perpignan, France (near the Spanish border), which the artist had declared in the 1960s to be the center of the universe.\n\nThom reportedly replied, \"I can assure you that Spain pivoted precisely — not in the area of — but exactly there where the Railway Station in Perpignan stands today\". Dalí was immediately enraptured by Thom's statement, influencing his painting \"Topological Abduction of Europe — Homage to René Thom\", the lower left corner of which features an equation closely linked to the \"swallow’s tail\": formula_1 an illustration of the graph, and the term \"queue d'aronde\". The seismic fracture that transverses \"Topological Abduction of Europe\" reappears in \"The Swallow’s Tail\" at the precise point where the y-axis of the swallow's tail graph intersects with the S-curve of the cusp.\n"}

He worked as the manager of a publishing house while amassing his collection of banknotes, at a time when notaphily, the collecting and study of paper money, was still in its infancy and a relatively cheap hobby.\n\nOver the years Pick became an acknowledged expert in the field of banknotes, and by 1964 his private collection of (at that time) 180,000 notes had become too extensive for a private collector. In that year the collection was received by the Bavarian Mortgages and Exchange Bank (Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechselbank, now HypoVereinsbank).

Labour's big majority in 1997 reflected the large overall majority in the Commons, and by the 2010 election it had become touted by one published analysis as the seat that the Conservatives needed to win to secure an overall majority. Fittingly, 2010 saw a marginal majority and the national result was a hung parliament with the Conservative Party the largest party. 2010 here was the Labour Party's second highest share of the vote in the narrow, traditional grouping of East Anglia (Suffolk, Norfolk and Essex).\n\nWaveney had been held for many years by James Prior Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1970–1972), Leader of the House of Commons (1972–1974), Secretary of State for Employment (1979–1981) then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland during the Heath ministry then the Thatcher ministry with an economic politics considered more centre-ground, then known as forming the wets' ideology.\n\nBob Blizzard served as a senior Government Whip from 2008 until 2010 when he lost at the election that May.\n\nThe seat is based around the town of Lowestoft, and includes several smaller market towns and seaside resorts in north-east Suffolk.

{"id": "1827784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827784", "title": "Glassell Park, Los Angeles", "text": "Glassell Park, Los Angeles\n\nGlassell Park is a neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, California, in the San Rafael Hills.\n\nThe 2000 U.S. Census counted 23,467 residents in the 2.75-square-mile Glassell Park neighborhood—or 8,524 people per square mile, an average population density for the city. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 24,816. The median age for residents was 30, about average for the city and county.\n\nThe neighborhood was considered \"moderately diverse\" ethnically, with a high percentage of Asians and Latinos. As of the early 2000s, the breakdown was Latinos, 66.1%; whites, 13.7%; Asians, 17.4%; blacks, 1.4%; and others, 1.4%. The 2010 Census reported Latinos, 61%; Whites 15.55%; Asians 20.47%; and Blacks, 1.79%. Mexico (49.3%) and the Philippines (16.2%) were the most common places of birth for the 51.5% of residents who were born abroad, a relatively high percentage compared to the city as a whole.\n\nLike its ethnic composition, Glassell Park is inhabited by a wide variety of socioeconomic groups and is experiencing significant demographic change and economic development. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $50,098, an average figure for Los Angeles. The percentage of households that earned $20,000 to $40,000 yearly was high for Los Angeles County. The average household size of 3.3 people was high for Los Angeles. Renters occupied 56.2% of the housing stock and house- or apartment owners held 43.8%.\n\nAccording to the Mapping L.A. project of the \"Los Angeles Times,\" Glassell Park is bordered on the north by Glendale, on the northeast and east by Eagle Rock, on the southeast by Mount Washington, on the south and southwest by Elysian Valley and on the west by Atwater Village.\n\nThe neighborhood is located in a relatively hilly region of the San Rafael Hills mountain range. Due to its hilly geography, many Glassell Park homes are built on hillsides with views of the surrounding area. Like many hillside areas in Southern California, the LAFD imposes parking restrictions on certain streets during high-fire-danger \"red flag\" days.\n\nIn early 2013, a local artist installed large letters spelling \"Glassellland\" in the vacant hills above the Glassell Park Recreation Center. The name \"Glassellland\" is a reference to \"Hollywoodland\"—a real estate development whose promotional sign still stands as the famous Hollywood Sign.\n\nRelation of Glassell Park to nearby places, not necessarily contiguous:\n\nThe land that would later become Glassell Park was originally part of Rancho San Rafael, granted in 1784 to Spanish army corporal José María Verdugo. Attorney Andrew Glassell received part of Rancho San Rafael from the lawsuit known as the Great Partition of 1871. Glassell eventually settled in the area with his family, for whom many streets, including Toland Way, Drew St, Andrita and Marguarite Streets are named.\n\nThe development of Glassell Park began in the early 20th century, as subdivisions between Verdugo and San Fernando Roads began to be sold in 1907. In 1912, the city of Los Angeles annexed most of Glassell Park, annexing the remainder in 1916. The Glassell family continued to subdivide their land, selling off what is now Forest Lawn Memorial Park in 1905. The growing neighborhood was served by a line of the Los Angeles Railway, which traveled in the median of Eagle Rock Boulevard towards Eagle Rock.\n\nGlassell Park suffered periods of gang activity in the final decades of the 20th century due to the arrival of the Mexican-American Avenues. In 2008 and 2009, the police launched a major raid against The Avenues (gang) stronghold at 3304 Drew St. and demolished its former neighborhood stronghold, replacing it with the Glassell Park Community Garden. The Glassell Park Community Garden is now a focal point of community life in the area and regularly hosts neighborhood events.\n\nToday, Glassell Park is experiencing significant and steady demographic shifts due to its abundant craftsmen and hillside homes, and convenient location close to Downtown Los Angeles, Silver Lake, and Highland Park. Glassell Park's median home price is increasing at a rapid pace, significantly exceeding that of Los Angeles County. In 2016, the median home price in Los Angeles County rose by about 7 percent; in that same period, the median home price in Glassell Park rose 25.3 percent.\n\nGlassell Park stands to benefit greatly from the city's $1.6-billion Los Angeles River revitalization project. The project will restore habitat, widen the river, create wetlands and provide access points and bike trails along an 11-mile stretch of the Los Angeles River that runs from downtown Los Angeles through Glassell Park.\n\nDistricts that represent Glassell Park, in part or completely currently are:\n\nNineteen percent of Glassell Park residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, an average figure for both the city and the county.\n\nSchools in Glassell Park are:\n\nThe Glassell Park Recreation Center is near the center of Glassell Park, on Verdugo Road. The Rio de Los Angeles State Park is along San Fernando Road and adjacent to the Los Angeles River. It is on part of the former Taylor Yard, a railway switching facility in Glassell Park and Cypress Park.\n\n\n"}

He studied first at Oneida Institute starting in 1841. He graduated from Auburn Theological Seminary in New York City in 1847. He held pastorates in Washington, D.C., and New York City before moving to Iowa. Grinnell was the young man to whom Horace Greeley is quoted as having given the famous advice, \"Go West, young man.\" Grinnell was also involved in railway building and was instrumental in the move of Grinnell College, known at the time as Iowa College, from Davenport to the newly established town of Grinnell.\n\nIn Iowa, Grinnell was elected to the Iowa Senate, where he served from 1856 to 1860. At the same time, he studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1858, and set up his legal practice in Grinnell. He was a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention that nominated Abraham Lincoln for President.\n\nGrinnell was also a 'conductor' on the Underground Railroad and was associated with John Brown. He provided shelter to John Brown in 1859 after Brown's anti-slavery raids in Kansas and Missouri.\n\nIn 1862, after the 1860 census increased the number of U.S. House seats in Iowa from two to six, Grinnell ran for the newly created seat representing Iowa's 4th congressional district. The Fourth District was then a diamond-shaped configuration of twelve counties that included Newton and Iowa City, and ran from the Missouri border to the southern edge of Waterloo. After winning the Republican nomination and the general election in 1862, he served in the Thirty-eighth Congress. In 1864 he won re-election, serving in the Thirty-ninth Congress. On June 14, 1866, he was assaulted by fellow congressman Lovell Rousseau for insulting him and his home state of Kentucky during a House debate.\n\nGrinnell lost the Republican nomination for a third term, losing by thirteen votes to Judge William Loughridge in June 1866.\n\nAfter his service in Congress, Grinnell resumed the practice of law. He was also interested in the building of railroads, becoming a director of the Rock Island Railroad, and receiver of the Iowa Central Railroad (later the St. Louis & St. Paul Railroad). He also served as president of the Iowa State Horticultural Society and of the First National Bank in Grinnell.\n\nHe died of throat disease, complicated by asthma, at his home in Grinnell on March 31, 1891. He was interred in Hazelwood Cemetery.\n\nArticles on his life and his obituary are available from the online resources from Drake Library in Grinnell, Iowa. Many additional materials are available in the Grinnell Room Archives at Drake Library.\n\n\n"}

He was Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs from 1938 to 1946. His long tenure of the Permanent Secretary's office makes him one of the central figures of British policy before and during the Second World War. His diaries are a source of great value and give a sharp sense of the man and his life. Like most senior officials at the Foreign Office, he was bitterly critical of the appeasement policies of the 1930s but admitted that until British rearmament was better advanced, there were few other options. In particular, he stressed that without an American commitment to joint defence against Japan, Britain would be torn between the eastern and western spheres. Conflict with Germany would automatically expose Britain's Asian Empire to Japanese aggression.\n\nCadogan was brought up in a distinguished and wealthy aristocratic family as the seventh son and youngest child of George Cadogan, 5th Earl Cadogan, and his first wife Lady Beatrix Jane Craven, daughter of William Craven, 2nd Earl of Craven. He was the brother of Henry Cadogan, Viscount Chelsea, Gerald Cadogan, 6th Earl Cadogan, William Cadogan, and Sir Edward Cadogan. He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, where he read History.\n\nCadogan had a distinguished career in the Diplomatic Service, serving from 1908 to 1950. His first posting was to Constantinople, where he \"spent two happy years learning the craft of diplomacy and playing upon the head of Chancery a series of ingenious practical jokes.\" Cadogan's second posting was in Vienna, and during the First World War, he served in the Foreign Office in London.\n\nAt the end of the First World War, he served at the Versailles Peace Conference. In 1923, he became the head of the League of Nations section of the Foreign Office and remained quite optimistic about the prospects for the League. He was less confident about the prospects of success for the Disarmament Conference in Geneva and became quite frustrated at the lack of trust necessary for joint disarmament. Performing this work, he developed an appreciation for his colleague and superior, Anthony Eden. Cadogan found him agreeable, and in a 1933 letter to his wife, he wrote, \"He seems to me to have a very good idea of what is right and what is wrong, and if he thinks a thing is right he goes all out for it, hard, and if he thinks a thing is wrong, ten million wild hordes won't make him do it.\" Eden returned the admiration, writing that Cadogan \"carried out his thankless task with a rare blend of intelligence, sensibility, and patience.\" \n\nIn 1933, with Adolf Hitler in power and the fate of the Disarmament Conference clear, Cadogan accepted a posting at the British legation in Peking. The family arrived in 1934, after the Chinese government had evacuated Peking because of troubles with Japan. He met with Chiang Kai-shek and attempted to persuade him of Britain's support. Despite the lack of a real Chinese government, Cadogan did his best but lacked support from the Foreign Office. In 1935, after his recommendation to extend a loan to the Chinese government was again denied, he wrote that \"with all their protestations that they mean to 'stay in China', they do \"nothing\". And 'staying' will cost them something in money or effort or risk. The Chinese are becoming sick of us. And there is no use my 'keeping in touch' with them if I never can give them an encouragement at all\".\n\nIn 1936, Cadogan received a request from the newly appointed Secretary of State, Anthony Eden, offering him the post of joint Deputy Under-Secretary. He regretted leaving China so suddenly but took up the offer and returned to London. Things there had grown much worse since his departure. Italy had attacked Abyssinia and Germany had reoccupied the Rhineland. Assessing the situation, Cadogan advised a revision of the more vindictive elements of the Treaty of Versailles, \"which was really more in the nature of an armistice.\" However, this suggestion was not taken up by Sir Robert Vansittart or Eden. It was felt that modifying the Treaty would only increase Germany's ambitions. Cadogan disagreed and wrote in his diary: \"I believe that, so long as she is allowed to nurse her resentment to her bosom, her claims increase with her armaments.\" He wanted to engage Germany in an effort to get German grievances set down on paper and was not as troubled by his colleagues about the possibility of German domination of Central Europe. Cadogan grew impatient with the lack of strategic direction in the Foreign Office. He complained, \"It can't be said that our 'policy' so far has been successful. In fact we haven't \"got\" a policy; we merely wait to see what will happen to us next\".\n\nIn 1938, Cadogan replaced Robert Vansittart as Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office. He considered his predecessor's style to be emotional and disordered compared to Cadogan's terse and efficient manner. There were, however, no significant divergences in policy although Vansittart's detestation of the dictators was more publicly known. Cadogan served in this capacity from 1938 to 1946 and represented Britain at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944, where he became well acquainted with Edward Stettinius and Andrei Gromyko. His work there was greatly respected. Winston Churchill told Parliament, \"His Majesty's Government could have had no abler representative that Sir Alexander Cadogan and there is no doubt that a most valuable task has been discharged.\"\n\nIn preparation for the Yalta Conference, Cadogan expended a great deal of effort attempting to bring the \"London Poles\" under Stanislaw Mikolajczyk around to the idea of losing their eastern territories to the Soviet Union. After 22,000 Polish officers and intellectuals were shot by the Soviets in Katyn, Cadogan wrote in his diary on 18 June 1943 that \"years before Katyn the Soviet Government made a habit of butchering their own citizens by the 10,000s, and if we could fling ourselves into their arms in 1941, I don't know that Katyn makes our position more delicate. The blood of Russians cries as loud to heaven as that of Poles. But it's very nasty. How can Poles ever live amicably alongside Russians, and how can we discuss with Russians execution of German 'war criminals', when we have condoned this?\" He was also involved in discussions about the composition of provisional governments in Yugoslavia and Greece. Cadogan then accompanied the British delegation to the Yalta Conference in 1945. David Dilks, the editor of his published diaries, notes, \"He looked on Yalta much as he had looked at Munich. Both agreements entailed serious injury to the rights of states which could not defend themselves against large and predatory neighbours; both reflected the military and geographical facts; neither was a matter for pride or for fierce self-reproach, since it hardly lay in British power at the material time to do other; both looked better on signature than in the hard after-light.\" Cadogan wrote in his diary in January 1944: \"They [the Soviet diplomats] are the most stinking creepy set of Jews I've ever come across.\"\n\nAt the end of the war Cadogan had hoped for the Washington embassy but it went to another capable career diplomat, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. Instead, it is probably his experience with the League of Nations and his prominent role at Dumbarton Oaks that made Clement Attlee appoint Cadogan the first Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations. He served in this capacity from 1946 to 1950. During his time at the UN, as David Dilks points out, \"British diplomacy had to be conducted from a precarious position of over-commitment and economic instability.\" Cadogan expressed great frustration with the inflexibility of his Soviet counterparts, who were forbidden from mixing with other delegations or informal exchanges of views. At one point, he asked himself, \"How can ten men discuss with a ventriloquist's doll?\" He saw many parallels between Soviet actions at the beginning of the Cold War and those of the Germans on the eve of the Second World War. He remarked to Winston Churchill, \"What forces itself on one's attention is the degree to which everything favours the evildoer, if he is blatant enough. Any honest Government fights (in peacetime) with two hands tied behind its back. The brilliant blatancy of the Russians is something that we can admire but cannot emulate. It gives them a great advantage.\" Although he was never celebrated as a public figure, Cadogan enjoyed great prestige within diplomatic circles. He was widely respected for his ability, character and experience. He and his wife cultivated a large and varied number of friends by entertaining at their Long Island home, Hillandale.\n\nIn 1952, Cadogan was made Chairman of Board of Governors of the BBC by Winston Churchill, who had returned to office the previous year. When Cadogan expressed his concern that he lacked appropriate qualifications, Churchill replied, \"There \"are\" no qualifications. All you have to do is to be fair\". Cadogan added, \"And sensible, I suppose\". Churchill nodded. On his appointment, he confessed that he had never seen a BBC television programme and that what he had seen of American television, he disliked. He served until 1957. In the last decade of his life, Cadogan gradually shed his commitments and devoted more time to his late-blooming interest in art.\n\nCadogan was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1939, a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1941, admitted to the Privy Council in 1946 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1951.\n\nCadogan married Lady Theodosia Acheson, daughter of Archibald Acheson, 4th Earl of Gosford, in 1912. They had a son and three daughters. He died in July 1968, aged 83. Lady Theodosia Cadogan died in October 1977.\n"}

His career lasted from 1981 to 1993, and included more than 500 films.\n\nButler was born Paul David Siederman in Brooklyn to a Jewish father and a mother of half German/Irish and half Cherokee Native American descent. His paternal grandfather, Sam Siederman, was reportedly the half-brother of Russian communist leader Leon Trotsky.\n\nButler initially tried his luck at mainstream acting, performing in a variety of Off-Broadway plays. He also had a few walk-on appearances on the soap opera \"One Life to Live\" in 1978 and made an uncredited appearance in Frank Henenlotter's 1982 horror film \"Basket Case.\" He was generally unhappy with the constant pressure to sleep with men in exchange for parts, and began to slowly grow tired of the wasted effort.\n\nHe first got into hardcore in 1981 after answering an advertisement in \"Backstage Magazine\" looking for hardcore actors. He went in to audition for a non-sex role and after a little persuading, ended up with a hardcore sex role in the 1981 film \"Young, Wild and Wonderful\".\n\nHis stage name was inspired from hearing the Jerry Butler song \"Only the Strong Survive\" on the radio while he was picking up his first paycheck. Butler was touted as the most talented male actor in his day with turns in Chuck Vincent's bigger budget adult efforts \"Roommates (1981)\" and \"In Love\" (1983), the latter winning him \"Hustler\"'s \"Best Actor Award\".\n\nDuring his adult film career, Butler made appearances in three more mainstream films, playing a comedic role in \"Preppies\" (1984), the dramatic lead in psychological thriller \"Deranged\" (1987) both directed by Chuck Vincent, and in the horror film \"Evils of the Night\" (1985).\n\nAccording to the Internet Adult Film Database, Butler acted in 656 adult films during his lifetime.\n\nIn 1987, Butler married former child actress Lisa Loring, who was best known for playing Wednesday Addams on \"The Addams Family\" television show in the 1960s. They met on the set of the adult film \"Traci's Big Trick\" (1987), where Lisa was working as a make-up artist.\n\nIn an interview with NBC's \"Dateline\" in the 1990s Butler described himself as \"addicted to the lifestyle\" but claimed to be ashamed of his clandestine behavior and its effect on his marriage. The couple later appeared on the \"Sally Jessy Raphael Show\", again discussing the damage Butler's porn career was causing to their marriage. Butler and Loring divorced in 1992.\n\nButler released an autobiography in 1989, as told to Robert Rimmer and Catherine Tavel, called \"Raw Talent\". The book gave an insider's account of the porn scene. He was very forthcoming in the book, giving very intimate details of some of his fellow co-workers in the business, and citing the existence of widespread drug abuse in the industry. Butler re-surfaced in 2003 in a non-sex role in a porn film titled \"Sexy Sluts: Been There, Done That\", released that year, which was directed by underground rapper Necro. Butler was also a featured guest on Necro's album \"The Sexorcist\" (2005).\n\nButler had been diagnosed with a tumour some months previously (which had been removed in an operation), but a check-up following a cycling accident revealed the cancer had spread throughout his body and was inoperable. He died in Brooklyn, New York, aged 58, on January 27, 2018.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1827830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827830", "title": "Rajuvula", "text": "Rajuvula\n\nRajuvula was an Indo-Scythian Great Satrap (\"Mahakshatrapa\"), one of the \"Northern Satraps\" who ruled in the area of Mathura in the northern Indian Subcontinent in the years around 10 CE. The Mathura lion capital was consecrated under the reign of Rajuvula. In central India, the Indo-Scythians had conquered the area of Mathura from Indian kings around 60 BCE. Some of their satraps were Hagamasha and Hagana, who were in turn followed by Rajuvula.\n\nRajuvula is thought to have invaded the last of the Indo-Greek territories in the eastern Punjab, and replaced the last of the Indo-Greek kings, Strato II and Strato III. The main coinage of Rajuvula imitated that of the Indo-Greek rulers he supplanted.\nThe Mathura lion capital, an Indo-Scythian sandstone capital from Mathura in Central India, and dated to the 1st century CE, describes in kharoshthi the gift of a stupa with a relic of the Buddha, by queen Nadasi Kasa, \"the wife of Rajuvula\" and \"daughter of Aiyasi Kamuia\", which was an older view supported by Bühler, Rapson, Lüders and others. But according to a later view propounded by Sten Konow, and accepted by later scholars, the principal donor making endowments was princess Aiyasi Kamuia, \"chief queen of Rajuvula\" and \"daughter of Yuvaraja Kharaosta Kamuio\". Nadasi Kasa (or Nada Diaka) was daughter of Ayasia Kamuia.\n\nAccording to an older view, Yuvaraja Kharaosta Kamuio was thought to be the son of Ayasi Kamuia who in turn was thought to be the widow of Arta whom Rajuvula later married. Konow refuted this view, and concluded that Ayasia Kamuia, chief queen of Rajuvula, was the daughter and not the mother of Kharaosta Kamuio. The fact that the last name 'Kamuia' has been used both by Yuvaraja Kharaosta as well as the princess Aiyasi clearly proves that Aiyasi Kamuia was the daughter and not the mother of Yuvaraja Kharaosta Kamuio (Kambojaka), since such family-names or designations are naturally inherited from the father's side and not from the mother's. Hence, Dr Konow's interpretation appears more convincing.\n\nThe capital also mentions the genealogy of several Indo-Scythian satraps of Mathura.\n\nThe presence of the Buddhist symbol triratana at the center of the capital suggests that Rajuvula was, at least nominally, following the Buddhist faith.\n\nSeveral other inscription from Mathura mention Rajuvula, such as the Mora Well Inscription.\n\nSodasa, son of Rajuvula, succeeded him and also made Mathura his capital.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1827834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827834", "title": "Big Money Hustlas", "text": "Big Money Hustlas\n\nBig Money Hustlas is a 2000 American comedy film directed by John Cafiero as his feature film debut. The film, a homage to exploitation films of the 1970s, focuses on a streetwise San Francisco detective who tries to take down a New York City crime lord. It stars Insane Clown Posse's Joseph \"Violent J\" Bruce and Joseph \"Shaggy 2 Dope\" Utsler, and Twiztid's Jamie Madrox and Monoxide Child, and features appearances by Harland Williams, Johnny Brennan, Rudy Ray Moore, Mick Foley and the Misfits. Released direct-to-video, the film debuted at #1 on \"Billboard\"'s Top Music Videos chart, and was later certified platinum by the RIAA. A Western genre follow-up, \"Big Money Rustlas\", was released direct-to-video on August 17, 2010. In 2015, Insane Clown Posse announced the production of a sequel entitled \"Big Money Thrusters\".\n\nSugar Bear (Shaggy 2 Dope), a streetwise detective from San Francisco, is brought to New York City by its chief of police (John G. Brennan) to take down Big Baby Sweets (Violent J), a notorious crime lord who controls the entirety of the city's criminal underworld with his right-hand men Big Stank (Jamie Madrox) and Lil' Poot (Monoxide Child), and his personal security ninja Hack Benjamin (Robert Bruce). After getting a firsthand look at the police force's incompetence via Officer Harry Cox (Harland Williams), Sugar Bear prevents a robbery of a local doughnut shop by one of Big Baby Sweets' thugs, Ape Boy, and begins a romance with a 300-pound stripper, Missy (Sindee Williams).\n\nHe soon arrests Big Baby Sweets, Big Stank and Lil' Poot himself, but the police are forced to let them go because of a lack of evidence. The gangsters retaliate by terrorizing the city and sending a pair of stealthy Magic Ninjas to murder Missy, leading Sugar Bear to depressed alcoholism. Sugar Bear's idol, Dolemite (Rudy Ray Moore), appears before him to reassure him and begin training him to bring down Sweets' evil empire. Sugar Bear kills the Magic Ninjas and Hack Benjamin, and has Big Stank and Lil' Poot carted off by their wealthy, upper-class parents before defeating another one of Big Baby Sweets' henchmen, Cactus Sac (Mick Foley), in a wrestling match. During Big Baby Sweets' personal confrontation with Sugar Bear, Sweets is shot by his mother, and Sugar Bear removes Sweets' face paint, revealing him to be Harry Cox.\n\n\n\"Big Money Hustlas\" was inspired by the video \"Big Ballers\". Insane Clown Posse and Twiztid had seen the movie and loved the video's low-budget comedy style. Using the ideas that he, Joseph Utsler, James Spaniolo, and Paul Methric created, Joseph Bruce wrote the entire script himself in one month. Island Records gave him $250,000 to produce the film.\n\n\"Big Money Hustlas\" was shot in New York. Most of the crew disliked the movie and the cast. They went on strike twice, while only a few crew members continued to work. The movie was shot in two months, but went way over budget. Halfway through the movie, Bruce had to pay $100,000 of his own money to continue filming. Island never paid the crew for the last two weeks of work due to the film going so far over budget.\n\nThe movie features many friends of Insane Clown Posse. Mick Foley was brought in as his \"Cactus Sac\" persona that the duo has used in their \"Strangle-Mania\" videos. Robert Bruce, Joseph Bruce's brother, also appears in the movie in multiple personas which include The Preacher, Hack Benjamin, and an officer. Harland Williams appeared at the request of Joseph Bruce, who was grateful and impressed that Williams, who had appeared in major studio productions such as \"Half Baked\" and \"There's Something About Mary\", would be willing to appear in a low-budget independent film like \"Big Money Hustlas\". John G. Brennan and Kamal Ahmed of The Jerky Boys appeared separately, because they were unable to get along with each other during the filming.\n\nIn contrast with the members of the production who received the movie negatively, Bruce gave bonuses to some cast and crew, including Foley, Rudy Ray Moore, and Williams. Even though Jerry Only only appeared in a small cameo with his band The Misfits, he stuck around for the entire shoot. Jerry Only's son plays the altar boy in the opening scene.\n\nIn addition to playing Hack Benjamin, Jumpsteady also plays several background characters. Violent J also appeared in a gorilla costume as \"Ape Boy\"; Jamie Madrox recorded a dub for the character's voice. Although a production company was paid $8,000 to replace the original audio with the dub, they told the director that they were unable to do it, and a decision was made to instead keep the original audio track, with Violent J's voice.\n\nThe film's music was written by Psychopathic Records producer Mike E. Clark. A soundtrack album was released in 2001, and featured new music from the film, in addition to previously released tracks by Insane Clown Posse and Twiztid, and the theme to the 1976 film \"The Human Tornado\", performed by Rudy Ray Moore. While not included in the official soundtrack, key songs from the movie were used from Gert Wilden's album Schoolgirl Report. The song \"Girl Faces\" was used during the bedroom love scene, and \"Little Girls\" played in the background at the gentlemen's club. Gert Wilden was noteworthy for erotic music in the 1970s, and thus the reason his music was used in the film.\n\n\"Big Money Hustlas\" debuted at #1 on \"Billboard\"'s Top Music Videos chart. On January 23, 2009, the film achieved platinum certification. A follow up, entitled \"Big Money Rustlas\", began filming in mid-January 2009 and concluded on February 24, 2009. Based in the Western genre, \"Big Money Rustlas\" was released on DVD on August 17, 2010. The record label Majik Ninja Entertainment, formed by Twiztid in 2014, is named after a line which they delivered in the film. In 2015, Insane Clown Posse announced that a sequel, \"Big Money Thrusters\", was being written.\n\n"}

{"id": "1827851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827851", "title": "Marine debris", "text": "Marine debris\n\nMarine debris, also known as marine litter, is human-created waste that has deliberately or accidentally been released in a sea or ocean. Floating oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and on coastlines, frequently washing aground, when it is known as \"beach litter\" or tidewrack. Deliberate disposal of wastes at sea is called \"ocean dumping\". Naturally occurring debris, such as driftwood, are also present.\n\nWith the increasing use of plastic, human influence has become an issue as many types of (petrochemical) plastics do not biodegrade. Waterborne plastic poses a serious threat to fish, seabirds, marine reptiles, and marine mammals, as well as to boats and coasts. Dumping, container spillages, litter washed into storm drains and waterways and wind-blown landfill waste all contribute to this problem.\n\nIn efforts to prevent and mediate marine debris and pollutants, laws and policies have been adopted internationally. Depending on relevance to the issues and various levels of contribution, some countries have introduced more specified protection policies.\n\nResearchers classify debris as either land- or ocean-based; in 1991, the United Nations Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution estimated that up to 80% of the pollution was land-based, with the remaining 20% originating from catastrophic events or maritime sources. More recent studies have found that more than half of plastic debris found on Korean shores is ocean-based.\n\nA wide variety of man-made objects can become marine debris; plastic bags, balloons, buoys, rope, medical waste, glass and plastic bottles, cigarette stubs, cigarette lighters, beverage cans, polystyrene, lost fishing line and nets, and various wastes from cruise ships and oil rigs are among the items commonly found to have washed ashore. Six pack rings, in particular, are considered emblematic of the problem.\n\nThe US military used ocean dumping for unused weapons and bombs, including ordinary bombs, UXO, landmines and chemical weapons from at least 1919 until 1970. Millions of pounds of ordnance were disposed of in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coasts of at least 16 states, from New Jersey to Hawaii (although these, of course, do not wash up onshore, and the US is not the only country who has practiced this).\n\nEighty percent of marine debris is plastic. Plastics accumulate because they typically do not biodegrade as many other substances do. They photodegrade on exposure to sunlight, although they do so only under dry conditions, as water inhibits photolysis. In a 2014 study using computer models, scientists from the group 5 Gyres, estimated 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic weighing 269,000 tons were dispersed in oceans in similar amount in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\n\nFishing nets left or lost in the ocean by fishermen – ghost nets – can entangle fish, dolphins, sea turtles, sharks, dugongs, crocodiles, seabirds, crabs, and other creatures. These nets restrict movement, causing starvation, laceration and infection, and, in animals that breathe air, suffocation.\n\n8.8 million metric tons of plastic waste are dumped in the world's oceans each year. Asia was the leading source of mismanaged plastic waste, with China alone accounting for 2.4 million metric tons.\n\nThe trade in plastic waste has been identified as the main cause of marine litter. Countries importing the waste plastics often lack the capacity to process all the material. As a result, the United Nations has imposed a ban on waste plastic trade unless it meets certain criteria.\n\nPlastic waste has reached all the world's oceans. This plastic pollution harms an estimated 100,000 sea turtles and marine mammals and 1,000,000 sea creatures each year. Larger plastics (called \"macroplastics\") such as plastic shopping bags can clog the digestive tracts of larger animals when consumed by them and can cause starvation through restricting the movement of food, or by filling the stomach and tricking the animal into thinking it is full. Microplastics on the other hand harm smaller marine life. For example, pelagic plastic pieces in the center of our ocean’s gyres outnumber live marine plankton, and are passed up the food chain to reach all marine life. A 1994 study of the seabed using trawl nets in the North-Western Mediterranean around the coasts of Spain, France, and Italy reported mean concentrations of debris of 1,935 items per square kilometre. Plastic debris accounted for 77%, of which 93% was plastic bags.\n\nNurdles, also known as \"mermaids' tears\", are plastic pellets, typically under five millimetres in diameter, that are a major component of marine debris. They are a raw material in plastics manufacturing, and enter the natural environment when spilled. Weathering produces ever smaller pieces. Nurdles strongly resemble fish eggs.\n\nLitter, made from diverse materials that are denser than surface water (such as glasses, metals and some plastics), have been found to spread over the floor of seas and open oceans, where it can become entangled in corals and interfere with other sea-floor life, or even become buried under sediment, making clean-up extremely difficult, especially due to the wide area of its dispersal compared to shipwrecks. Research performed by MBARI found items including plastic bags below 2000 m depth off the west coast of North America and around Hawaii.\n\nA recent study surveyed four separate locations to represent a wider range of marine habitats at depths varying from 1100-5000m. Three of the four locations had identifiable amounts of microplastics present in the top 1cm layer of sediment. Core samples were taken from each spot and had their microplastics filtered out of the normal sediment. The plastic components were identified using micro-Raman spectroscopy; the results showed man-made pigments commonly used in the plastic industry.\n\nThe 10 largest emitters of oceanic plastic pollution worldwide are, from the most to the least, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Egypt, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Bangladesh, largely through the rivers Yangtze, Indus, Yellow, Hai, Nile, Ganges, Pearl, Amur, Niger, and the Mekong, and accounting for \"90 percent of all the plastic that reaches the world's oceans.\"\n\nAn estimated 10,000 containers at sea each year are lost by container ships, usually during storms. One spillage occurred in the Pacific Ocean in 1992, when thousands of rubber ducks and other toys (now known as the \"Friendly Floatees\") went overboard during a storm. The toys have since been found all over the world, providing a better understanding of ocean currents. Similar incidents have happened before, such as when \"Hansa Carrier\" dropped 21 containers (with one notably containing buoyant Nike shoes). In 2007, MSC Napoli beached in the English Channel, dropping hundreds of containers, most of which washed up on the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site.\n\nIn Halifax Harbour, Nova Scotia, 52% of items were generated by recreational use of an urban park, 14% from sewage disposal and only 7% from shipping and fishing activities. Around four fifths of oceanic debris is from rubbish blown onto the water from landfills, and urban runoff.\n\nSome studies show that marine debris may be dominant in particular locations. For example, a 2016 study of Aruba found that debris found the windward side of the island was predominantly marine debris from distant sources. In 2013, debris from six beaches in Korea was collected and analyzed: 56% was found to be \"ocean-based\" and 44% \"land-based\".\n\nIn the 1987 Syringe Tide, medical waste washed ashore in New Jersey after having been blown from Fresh Kills Landfill. On the remote sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia, fishing-related debris, approximately 80% plastics, are responsible for the entanglement of large numbers of Antarctic fur seals.\n\nMarine litter is even found on the floor of the Arctic ocean.\n\nDespite the abundance of plastic being deposited into the ocean, the distribution across the oceans was relatively unknown. Appropriately, a study was conducted in 2014 to model an accurate representation of the current magnitude of surface level pollution within the oceans. The project was concluded with the identification of five areas across all the oceans where the majority of plastic was being concentrated. \n\nThe researchers collected a total of 3070 samples across the world to identify hot spots of surface level plastic pollution. The pattern of distribution closely mirrored models of oceanic currents with the North Pacific Gyre, or Great Pacific Garbage Patch, being the highest density of plastic accumulation. The other four gyres include the North Atlantic Gyre between the North America and Africa, the South Atlantic Gyre located between eastern South America and the tip of Africa, the South Pacific Gyre located west of South America, and the Indian Ocean Gyre found east of south Africa listed in order of decreasing size.\n\nOnce waterborne, debris becomes mobile. Flotsam can be blown by the wind, or follow the flow of ocean currents, often ending up in the middle of oceanic gyres where currents are weakest. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is one such example of this, comprising a vast region of the North Pacific Ocean rich with anthropogenic wastes. Estimated to be double the size of Texas, the area contains more than 3 million tons of plastic.The combination of two developed countries disposing of their plastic into the neighboring ocean is the source of blame. The eastern coast of Asia maintains the highest population density of any coast consisting of a third of the world's coastal population. \nPatches may be large enough to be viewed by satellite. For example, when the Malaysian Flight MH370 disappeared in 2014, satellites were scanning the oceans surface for any sign of it, and instead of finding debris from the plane they came across floating garbage. The gyre contains approximately six pounds of plastic for every pound of plankton.\n\nThe oceans may contain as much as one hundred million tons of plastic. It is estimated that each garbage patch in the ocean have up to one million tons of trash swirling around in them, sometimes extending down to around one hundred feet below the surface. Some items that have been extracted from these garbage patches are: a drum of hazardous chemicals, plastic hangers, tires, cable cords, a ton of tangled netting etc.\n\nOver 40% of oceans are classified as subtropical gyres, a quarter of the planet’s surface area has become an accumulator of floating plastic debris.\n\nIslands situated within gyres frequently have coastlines flooded by waste that washes ashore; prime examples are Midway and Hawaii. Clean-up teams around the world patrol beaches to attack this environmental threat.\n\nMore than 37 million pieces of plastic debris have accumulated on Henderson Island, a remote Pitcairn island in the South Pacific, reported to be the highest density of debris reported anywhere in the world, yet the trash accounts for only 1.98 seconds’ worth of the annual global production of plastic.\n\nMany animals that live on or in the sea consume flotsam by mistake, as it often looks similar to their natural prey. Bulky plastic debris may become permanently lodged in the digestive tracts of these animals, blocking the passage of food and causing death through starvation or infection. Tiny floating plastic particles also resemble zooplankton, which can lead filter feeders to consume them and cause them to enter the ocean food chain. In samples taken from the North Pacific Gyre in 1999 by the Algalita Marine Research Foundation, the mass of plastic exceeded that of zooplankton by a factor of six.\n\nToxic additives used in plastic manufacturing can leach into their surroundings when exposed to water. Waterborne hydrophobic pollutants collect and magnify on the surface of plastic debris, thus making plastic more deadly in the ocean than it would be on land. Hydrophobic contaminants bioaccumulate in fatty tissues, biomagnifying up the food chain and pressuring apex predators and humans. Some plastic additives disrupt the endocrine system when consumed; others can suppress the immune system or decrease reproductive rates. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a famous example of a plasticizer produced in high volumes for food packing from where it can leach into food, leading to human exposure. As an estrogen and glucocorticoid receptor agonist, BPA is interfering with the endocrine system and is associated with increased fat in rodents.\n\nThe hydrophobic nature of plastic surfaces stimulates rapid formation of biofilms, which support a wide range of metabolic activities, and drive succession of other micro- and macro-organisms.\n\nConcern among experts has grown since the 2000s that some organisms have adapted to live on floating plastic debris, allowing them to disperse with ocean currents and thus potentially become invasive species in distant ecosystems. Research in 2014 in the waters around Australia confirmed a wealth of such colonists, even on tiny flakes, and also found thriving ocean bacteria eating into the plastic to form pits and grooves. These researchers showed that \"plastic biodegradation is occurring at the sea surface\" through the action of bacteria, and noted that this is congruent with a new body of research on such bacteria. Their finding is also congruent with the other major research undertaken in 2014, which sought to answer the riddle of the overall lack of build up of floating plastic in the oceans, despite ongoing high levels of dumping. Plastics were found as microfibres in core samples drilled from sediments at the bottom of the deep ocean. The cause of such widespread deep sea deposition has yet to be determined.\n\nNot all anthropogenic artifacts placed in the oceans are harmful. Iron and concrete structures typically do little damage to the environment because they generally sink to the bottom and become immobile, and at shallow depths they can even provide scaffolding for artificial reefs. Ships and subway cars have been deliberately sunk for that purpose.\n\nAdditionally, hermit crabs have been known to use pieces of beach litter as a shell when they cannot find an actual seashell of the size they need.\n\nThe ingestion of plastic by marine organisms has now been established at full ocean depth. Microplastic was found in the stomachs of hadal amphipods sampled from the Japan, Izu-Bonin, Mariana, Kermadec, New Hebrides and the Peru-Chile trenches. The amphipods from the Marina Trench were sampled at 10,890 m and all contained microfibres.\n\nTechniques for collecting and removing marine (or riverine) debris include the use of debris skimmer boats \"(pictured)\". Devices such as these can be used where floating debris presents a danger to navigation. For example, the US Army Corps of Engineers removes 90 tons of \"drifting material\" from San Francisco Bay every month. The Corps has been doing this work since 1942, when a seaplane carrying Admiral Chester W. Nimitz collided with a piece of floating debris and sank, costing the life of its pilot. The Ocean cleanup has also created a vessel for cleaning up riverine debris, called Interceptor. Once debris becomes \"beach litter\", collection by hand and specialized beach-cleaning machines are used to gather the debris.\n\nThere are also projects that stimulate fishing boats to remove any litter they accidentally fish up while fishing for fish.\n\nElsewhere, \"trash traps\" are installed on small rivers to capture waterborne debris before it reaches the sea. For example, South Australia's Adelaide operates a number of such traps, known as \"trash racks\" or \"gross pollutant traps\" on the Torrens River, which flows (during the wet season) into Gulf St Vincent.\n\nIn lakes or near the coast, manual removal can also be used. Project AWARE for example promotes the idea of letting dive clubs clean up litter, for example as a diving exercise.\n\nOn the sea, the removal of artificial debris (i.e. plastics) is still in its infancy. However some projects have been started which used ships with nets (Kaisei and New Horizon) to catch some plastics, primarily for research purposes. There is also Bluebird Marine System's SeaVax which was solar- and wind-powered and had an onboard shredder and cargo hold. The Sea Cleaners' Manta ship is similar in concept.\n\nAnother method to gather artificial litter has been proposed by The Ocean Cleanup's Boyan Slat. He suggested using platforms with arms to gather the debris, situated inside the current of gyres. The SAS Ocean Phoenix ship is somewhat similar in design.\n\nAnother issue is that removing marine debris from our oceans can potentially cause more harm than good. Cleaning up micro-plastics could also accidentally take out plankton, which are the main lower level food group for the marine food chain and over half of the photosynthesis on earth. One of the most efficient and cost effective ways to help reduce the amount of plastic entering our oceans is to not participate in using single-use plastics, avoid plastic bottled drinks such as water bottles, use reusable shopping bags, and to buy products with reusable packaging.\n\nOnce a year there is a diving marine debris removal operation in Scapa Flow in the Orkneys, run by Ghost Fishing UK, funded by World Animal Protection and Fat Face Foundation.\n\nThe ocean is a global common, so negative externalities of marine debris are not usually experienced by the producer. In the 1950s, the importance of government intervention with marine pollution protocol was recognized at the First Conference on the Law of the Sea.\n\nOcean dumping is controlled by international law, including:\n\nOne of the earliest anti-dumping laws was Australia's \"Beaches, Fishing Grounds and Sea Routes Protection Act 1932\", which prohibited the discharge of \"garbage, rubbish, ashes or organic refuse\" from \"any vessel in Australian waters\" without prior written permission from the federal government. It also required permission for scuttling. The act was passed in response to large amounts of garbage washing up on the beaches of Sydney and Newcastle from vessels outside the reach of local governments and the New South Wales government. It was repealed and replaced by the \"Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981\", which gave effect to the London Convention.\n\nIn 1972 and 1974, conventions were held in Oslo and Paris respectively, and resulted in the passing of the OSPAR Convention, an international treaty controlling marine pollution in the north-east Atlantic Ocean. The Barcelona Convention protects the Mediterranean Sea. The Water Framework Directive of 2000 is a European Union directive committing EU member states to free inland and coastal waters from human influence. In the United Kingdom, the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 is designed to \"ensure clean healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas, by putting in place better systems for delivering sustainable development of marine and coastal environment\".\nIn 2019, the EU parliament voted for an EU-wide ban on single-use plastic products such as plastic straws, cutlery, plates, and drink containers, polystyrene food and drink containers, plastic drink stirrers and plastic carrier bags and cotton buds. The law will take effect in 2021.\n\nIn the waters of the United States, there have been many observed consequences of pollution including: hypoxic zones, harmful agal blooms, and threatened species. In 1972, the United States Congress passed the Ocean Dumping Act, giving the Environmental Protection Agency power to monitor and regulate the dumping of sewage sludge, industrial waste, radioactive waste and biohazardous materials into the nation's territorial waters. The Act was amended sixteen years later to include medical wastes. It is illegal to dispose of any plastic in US waters.\n\nProperty law, admiralty law and the law of the sea may be of relevance when lost, mislaid, and abandoned property is found at sea. Salvage law rewards salvors for risking life and property to rescue the property of another from peril. On land the distinction between deliberate and accidental loss led to the concept of a \"treasure trove\". In the United Kingdom, shipwrecked goods should be reported to a Receiver of Wreck, and if identifiable, they should be returned to their rightful owner.\n\nA large number of groups and individuals are active in preventing or educating about marine debris. For example, 5 Gyres is an organization aimed at reducing plastics pollution in the oceans, and was one of two organizations that recently researched the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Heal the Bay is another organization, focusing on protecting California's Santa Monica Bay, by sponsoring beach cleanup programs along with other activities. Marina DeBris is an artist focusing most of her recent work on educating people about beach trash.\nInteractive sites like Adrift demonstrate where marine plastic is carried, over time, on the worlds ocean currents.\n\nOn 11 April 2013 in order to create awareness, artist Maria Cristina Finucci founded The Garbage patch state at UNESCO –Paris in front of Director General Irina Bokova. First of a series of events under the patronage of UNESCO and of Italian Ministry of the Environment.\n\nForty-eight plastics manufacturers from 25 countries, are members of the Global Plastic Associations for solutions on Marine Litter, have made the pledge to help prevent marine debris and to encourage recycling.\n\nMarine debris is a problem created by all of us, not only those in coastal regions. Ocean debris can come from as far away as Nebraska. The places that see the most damage are often not the places that produce the pollution. For ocean pollution, much of the trash may come from inland states, where people may never see the ocean and thus may never put any thought into protecting it. The problem continues to grow in tandem with plastics usage and disposal. Steps can be taken to prevent the movement of inland plastics into the oceans.\n\nPlastic debris from inland states come from two main sources: ordinary litter and materials from open dumps and landfills that blow or wash away to inland waterways and wastewater outflows. The refuse finds its way from inland waterways, rivers, streams and lakes to the ocean. Though ocean and coastal area cleanups are important, it is crucial to address plastic waste that originates from inland and landlocked states.\n\nAt the systems level, there are various ways to reduce the amount of debris entering our waterways:\nAs consumers, there are things we can do to help reduce the amount of plastic entering our waterways: \n\nThough the awareness of inland ocean conservation debris mitigation seems to be small compared to coastal states, some organizations in the United States are already working to improve this. The Colorado Ocean Coalition was formed in 2011 with the goal of impressing upon inland citizens that they don’t need to see the ocean to care about its health. It has since grown beyond one state and now forms the Inland Ocean Coalition, with the mission of promoting knowledge and awareness of how inland states contribute to pollution of the ocean, aiming to shatter the ‘out of sight, out of mind’ mentality that often applies in this region.\n\n“Those who live among mountains, rivers and inland cities have a direct impact on the cycle of life in the ocean,” reads the IOCO website. \"The changes we need to make to address the largest threats facing our seas—lowering carbon emissions, reducing trash and pollution, eating sustainable seafood, safeguarding watersheds, promoting marine protected areas (MPAs)—can happen from anywhere in the world.”\n\nThis organization has chapters in many inland US states and promotes programs like watershed cleanups, youth-centered education, and decreasing the use of plastic.\n\nThe Clean Oceans Project (TCOP) promotes conversion of the plastic waste into valuable liquid fuels, including gasoline, diesel and kerosene, using plastic-to-fuel conversion technology developed by Blest Co. Ltd., a Japanese environmental engineering company. TCOP plans to educate local communities and create a financial incentive for them to recycle plastic, keep their shorelines clean, and minimize plastic waste.\n\nIn 2019, a research group led scientists of Washington State University found a way to turn plastic waste products into jet fuel.\n\nAlso, the company \"Recycling Technologies\", has come up with a simple process that can convert plastic waste to an oil called Plaxx. The company is led by a team of engineers from the university of Warwick.\n\nOther companies working on a system for converting plastic waste to fuel include GRT Group and OMV.\n\n\n"}

Verhoeven, was the site of the 2003 discovery of a potentially new species of genus \"Homo\", \"Homo floresiensis\", the remains of which are coded LB1, LB2, etc., after the cave. The Indonesian field coordinator of the excavation team, Thomas Sutikna, was preparing to close up the dig at Liang Bua when the first indications of the important fossils were uncovered. So far it is the only location in which such remains have been identified, although archeological work in the nearby Soa Valley in Ngada Regency appears to support findings from the Liang Bua site.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, archaeologists discovered two hominin teeth in the cave that did not come from \"Homo floresiensis\".

On one hand, some experts on human origin argue that the discoveries represent a distinct species that lived in relatively modern times. Others argue that it is more likely that the bones of the most complete individual found in Liang Bua (individual LB1) are those of a local person who was, quite likely, simply suffering from a medical condition (perhaps Down Syndrome) rather than indicating that a unique species of \"Homo\" lived in Flores.\n\n\n\n"}

He moved to Goliad, Texas, in the 1840s, where he engaged in railroad construction, and served in the Texas Senate. He was a delegate to the 1861 Texas convention that adopted the state's Ordinance of Secession on the eve of the Civil War.\n\nLea was born in what is now Grainger County, Tennessee, but was then part of Knox County, the son of Major Lea and Lavinia (Jarnagin) Lea. He attended the former Greeneville College (now Tusculum College), after which he studied law. He fought in the Creek War as a major under Andrew Jackson in 1813, and clerked for the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1816. He was admitted to the bar in 1817, and began practicing in Knoxville. He married Maria Kennedy on October 6, 1818. They had four children, Abraham, Julia, Centhia, and James Kennedy. His second marriage was to Minerva Heard, and his third was to Mary Perkins.\n\nLea was appointed to the Board of Trustees of East Tennessee College (the forerunner of the University of Tennessee) in 1821, and later served as the board's secretary. That same year, he was appointed United States Attorney for Eastern Tennessee.\n\nA supporter of Andrew Jackson, Lea was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1827, defeating fiery anti-Jacksonite Thomas D. Arnold by a vote of 3,688 to 3,316. He again defeated Arnold in a hotly contested election in 1829, winning 4,713 votes to Arnold's 4,496. Arnold charged Lea with voter fraud, but the House Committee on Elections found no evidence of irregularities, and Lea was allowed to take his seat. He served in the Twentieth and Twenty-first congresses, from March 4, 1827, to March 4, 1831. He was narrowly defeated by Arnold for a third term in 1831, 4,935 votes to 4,702.\n\nAs a congressman, Lea was a strict constructionist and states' rights advocate. He generally opposed federal funding for internal improvements, most notably voting against the 1830 \"Hemphill Bill,\" which would have financed the construction of a road connecting Buffalo and New Orleans. He voted in favor of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, describing the House debate on the bill as \"one of the severest struggles that I have ever witnessed in Congress.\" He frequently clashed with fellow Tennessee congressman Davy Crockett, with Crockett calling Lea a \"poltroon, a scoundrel, and a puppy,\" and warning they would fight if they ever crossed paths.\n\nDuring the mid-1830s, Lea developed an interest in railroad construction, which many East Tennesseans viewed as a solution to the region's isolation. He was secretary of an 1836 Knoxville convention that mapped out the proposed Louisville, Cincinnati and Charleston Railroad. This proposed railroad was doomed by the Panic of 1837, however.\n\nLea moved to Jackson, Mississippi, in 1836. He then moved to Goliad, Texas, in 1846, to promote railroad construction. He worked with the Aransas Railroad Company, which sought to build a line from the Aransas Bay area to Goliad, and eventually from Goliad to San Antonio (his brother, Albert Miller Lea, was chief engineer of the company). In 1866, the company reincorporated as the Central Transit Company, re-mapping its line from Goliad to Galveston as part of a larger transcontinental effort. Though vigorously promoted by Lea, the company's plans never materialized.\n\nLea was a founding trustee of the University of Mississippi.\n\nBoth Albert and Pryor Lea supported the Knights of the Golden Circle, a secret society which planned to invade Mexico and Central America and establish a massive slave empire around the Gulf of Mexico. They pitched the society's plan to Governor Sam Houston in 1860, but Houston rejected the plan, and ordered the Texas Rangers to break up the Knights' assemblies.\n\nLea was a delegate to the Texas Secession Convention, which met in Austin in January 1861 to adopt an Ordinance of Secession, leading to eventual Texas membership in the Confederacy. He was elected to the Texas Senate later that year, serving a single term. During the war, he worked with Goliad Aid Association, which provided relief to indigent families, and served as a commissioner with the Aransas Salt Works.\n\nIn 1866, Governor James W. Throckmorton appointed Lea state superintendent of public instruction, though he was later removed for opposing Reconstruction. Goliad County elected Lea their delegate to the state's 1875 Constitutional Convention, but he declined due to his \"extreme age.\" He died on September 14, 1879 (age 85 years, 14 days), and is interred at Oak Hill Cemetery in Goliad.\n\n"}
{"id": "1827878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827878", "title": "Criterium", "text": "Criterium\n\nA criterium, or crit, is a bike race consisting of several laps around a closed circuit, the length of each lap or circuit ranging from about 400 m to 10,000 m.\n\nRace length can be determined by a number of laps or total time, in which case the number of remaining laps is calculated as the race progresses. Generally the event's duration (commonly one hour) is shorter than that of a traditional road race — which can last many hours, sometimes over the course of several days or even weeks, as in a Grand Tour. However, the average speed and intensity are appreciably higher. The winner is the first rider to cross the finish line without having been \"lapped\".\n\nEvents often have prizes (called \"primes\" and are usually cash) for winning specific intermediate laps (for instance, every 10th lap). A bell is usually rung to announce to the riders that whoever wins the next lap, wins the prime.\n\nSuccess in road criteriums requires a mix of good technical skills — in particular, the ability to corner smoothly while holding the line on the road, as well as rapidly and sharply — and riding safely with a large group on a short circuit and exceptional \"sprint\" ability to attack other riders and repeatedly accelerate hard from corners.\n\nCriteriums are relatively easy to organize, do not require a large amount of space, and are good for live spectators as they allow them to see the riders pass by many times. They are the most common type of bicycle racing in the continental United States. They are also gaining popularity as a format for mountain bike events.\n\nBelgium's Flanders region hosts a number of criteriums, as does the Netherlands. The most notable of these are held in late July and early August, just after the Tour de France. However, criteriums in Europe are mostly held in the format of a points race. First, second, and third rider at every 5th lap gets 3, 2, 1 points respectively, with double points for the final sprint. It was a long tradition that after the Tour these criteriums were fixed to have favourable results for local favorites, who may be participating for show after having ridden in a larger race such as the Tour de France.\n\nRacing bicycles used for Criteriums often have subtle, but significantly different geometry from those used in other mass-start, multi stage road race events. A Tour bicycle frameset's emphasis is on tracking plus stability while the Criterium-centric geometry strives to achieve stability and balance it with agility. Consequently Criterium racers will often choose bicycles with:\n\nIn the UK, Elite and Cat 1+2 riders often race together whilst Cat 3+4 riders race separately; however Elite and Cat 1+2+3 and 4th category only events are also common. Some events known as a handicap races allow Elite and Cat 1+2+3+4 riders to compete in the same race with riders from the different categories being set off at defined intervals starting with the 4th category. Most events contain a women's race which accepts all categories of female riders; however some women's events are only open to higher category riders, whilst some events allow women to compete with category Cat 3+4 men.\n\nIn the United States, the Men's Field (Pro + Cat 1 + Cat 2, and sometimes Cat 3) generally race together, Cat 3's often have their own races, Cat 4/5 Men often race together, but sometimes have their own races. In addition, there are a variety of masters categories which can be raced. The Women typically have two separate races, the P/1/2 (3) and the 3/4.\n\nCollegiate racing in the USA is sanctioned by USA Cycling (USAC) and consists of four categories: A, B, C, and D. Category A is equivalent to the P-1-2-3 field, category B is equivalent to the Cat 3-4 field, category C is equivalent to Cat 4/5, and D is equivalent to Cat 5. Thus, collegiate criteriums are organized accordingly.\n\nThe races will also vary depending upon how many people from separate teams enter, which will impact whether it will be a \"free-for-all\" or a team-focused event.\n"}

It is operated by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Cowan Lake State Park is open for year-round recreation and is known for a variety of birds that attract birdwatching enthusiasts to the park in southwestern Ohio.\n\nWhat is now Cowan Lake State Park was once home to the Miami and Shawnee Indians. The Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794 resulted in the opening of the land to American settlement. The first settler in the area was William Smalley. Smalley had previously been held captive by the Lenape. His language skills and knowledge of the land left him ideally suited to be among the pioneers in settling what became Clinton County, Ohio.\n\nCowan Creek, named for pioneer surveyor John Cowan, was dammed in 1950. The creation of Cowan Lake led to the establishment of Cowan Lake State Park in 1968. Its surface area is .\n\nCowan Lake State Park lies atop limestone that is laden with fossils. The fossilized plants and animals attract attention from both professional and amateur paleontologists. Much of what is now Ohio was covered by massive inland seas and lakes such as Lake Maumee. As the Appalachian Mountains were formed, the limestone that was once the sea floor was pushed to the surface.\n\nCowan Lake is surrounded by a deciduous forest of beech and maple trees. The combination of lake and forest makes the park a destination for birders, who can observe mallards, American wigeons, mergansers, great blue and green-backed herons, killdeer, eastern bluebirds, catbirds, and many other species of birds. The most common mammals at the park are groundhogs, skunks, raccoons, and opossums.\n\nOther plant life found at the park include bloodroot, wild ginger, and American lotus. The lotus is a water lily that thrives in the shallow waters of Cowan Lake. The leaves of the plant are quite large with yellow flowers.\n\nCowan Lake State Park is open for year-round recreation. There are six picnic areas and two pavilions. Cowan Lake State Park features six hiking trails and one trail that is open to mountain bikes.\n\nThere are 27 cottages that are heated and have air-conditioning. The cottages are fully furnished and linens are provided. There are 237 electric camp-sites and 17 sites without electricity. A centrally located bathhouse has showers, flush toilets and a sanitary dump station for RVs.\n\nCowan Lake is open for boating, swimming and fishing. Motorboats have a 10 horsepower limit. A marina on the southern shore of the lake provides rental boats, canoes and motors, with four launch ramps, fuel and dock rentals. Common game fish in Cowan Lake are muskellunge, crappie, largemouth bass and bluegill. There is a handicapped accessible fishing pier at the Pine Tree picnic area. A public swimming beach is on the southern shore of the lake. The 1,000 foot beach is located near the campers bathhouse and also has a snack bar.\n\n"}

{"id": "1827900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827900", "title": "Politics of Khuzestan Province", "text": "Politics of Khuzestan Province\n\nThis article focuses on the politics of Khuzestan Province, a petroleum-rich and ethnically diverse province of southwestern Iran. Some of the major Iranian oilfields like Ahvaz Field, Marun, Aghajari, Karanj, Shadegan and Mansouri are located in Khuzestan Province territory.\n\nKhuzestan is inhabited by different ethnic groups. The population of Khuzestan consists of Bakhtiari people, Iranian Arabs, Qashqai people, Afshar tribe (subgroups of Azeris), indigenous Persians and Armenians. Half of Khuzestan is mostly inhabited by Arabs, and the other half of Khuzestan is mostly inhabited by Luri people. Khuzestan's ethnic diversity has a bearing on Khuzestan's electoral politics, with ethnic minority rights playing a significant role in the province's political culture. The province's geographical location bordering Iraq and its oil resources also make it a politically sensitive region, particularly given its history of foreign intervention, notably the Iraqi invasion of 1980. At the same time, there are ethnic grievances among the province's population, mostly from some Arab groups. \n\nSome ethnic groups complain about the distribution of the revenue generated by oil resources with claims that the central government is failing to invest profits from the oil industry in employment generation, post-war reconstruction and welfare projects. Low human development indicators among local Khuzestanis are contrasted with the wealth generation of the local oil industry. Minority rights are frequently identified with strategic concerns, with ethnic unrest perceived by the Iranian government as being generated by foreign governments to undermine the country's oil industry and its internal stability. The politics of Khuzestan therefore have international significance and go beyond the realm of electoral politics.\n\nAccording to Jane's Information Group, \"\"Most Iranian Arabs seek their constitutionally guaranteed rights and do not have a separatist agenda ... While it may be true that some Arab activists are separatists, most see themselves as Iranians first and declare their commitment to the state's territorial integrity.\"\"\n\nKhuzestan has produced many prominent politicians. Iran's former Minister of Agriculture Mohammad Reza Eskandari, Mohsen Rezaee (secretary of Iran's powerful Expediency Discernment Council) and some parliamentary committee chairs have been from Khuzestan.\n\nAli Shamkhani, an Arab from Ahvaz, held Iran's sensitive top military post of Minister of Defense from 1997 to 2005, in President Khatami's government.\n\nThe Iraqi-born Ayatollah Mohsen Araki served as a Khuzestan representative in the Assembly of Experts, was the personal representative of Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (the Supreme Leader of Iran) in London and headed the Islamic Centre of England until 2004.\n\nEndemic poverty in Khuzestan is contrasted with the wealth generated by the province, particularly from oil, petrochemicals and agriculture.\n\nKhuzestan is inhabited by different ethnic groups. The population of Khuzestan consists of Lurs (including Bakhtiari people), Iranian Arabs, Qashqai people, Afshar tribe, indigenous Persians and Armenians. Half of Khuzestan is inhabited by Arabs, the other half of Khuzestan is inhabited by Luri people. Iranian Arabs in particular have experienced racial discrimination. Articles 15, 19 and 48 of the Iranian Constitution establish the basis for ethnic, linguistic and cultural minority rights in the fields of education, employment and the distribution of resources. However, human rights groups have claimed that Iranian minorities often face discrimination and restrictions on social, cultural, linguistic and religious freedoms (\"see Ethnic minorities in Iran\"). Minority issues are therefore a major feature of political debate in Khuzestan.\n\nKhuzestan has been a focus of criticism by human rights groups. Amnesty International routinely raises human rights concerns relating to Khuzestan's Arabs through linking with separatists websites who provide information, in particular the arrest and detention of political activists, torture and executions. While Khuzestan is not unique in terms of its human rights record, Amnesty notes that often these abuses are related to institutional discrimination. In its report entitled \"New government fails to address dire human rights situation\" published in February 2006, Amnesty states:\n\nIn 1997, Human Rights Watch reported that \"Iranian Arabs, an ethnic minority centered in southwest Iran, have cited significant restrictions on their language and culture, and on their right to participate effectively in decisions affecting the area in which they live.\" According to another report in the same year, \"Arabic is not taught in elementary schools, and the Arabic teaching in secondary schools focuses exclusively on religious texts. The governor of Khuzestan is not an Arab\" while \"Arabs make up 35-45 percent of the three million inhabitants of Khuzestan province in the southwest of Iran.\" In 2005, separatist groups claimed that there was \"inadequate attention to their culture and language by state media, facing discrimination in getting jobs, unfair distribution of Khuzestan's oil wealth.\"\n\nJoe Stork, the director of HRW's Middle East division, said: \"The Iranian authorities have again displayed their readiness to silence those who denounce human rights violations. We have serious allegations the government used excessive lethal force, arbitrary arrests and torture in Khuzistan.\"\n\nThe claims made by human rights groups have been strongly contested by the Iranian government, which claims that efforts to disproportionately accentuate the problems in Khuzestan are being led by foreign media or political groups, particularly those based in the UK. The governor's office of Khuzestan claims the provincial GDP to rank 3rd in the nation, yet to what extent the local population benefits from these fruits remains unclear.\n\nThe problem was highlighted by the UN Special Rapporteur for Adequate Housing, following a visit to Khuzestan in July 2005. He claimed that industrial and agricultural development projects had displaced Arabs from their land, who received compensation that amounted to a fraction of the market value. He also claimed that new housing developments, such as the one new town in Shirinshah, were being created for non-Arab workers brought in from Yazd, while local people continued to suffer joblessness and poor housing.\n\nKothari also drew attention to the situation facing the Laks, who are an Iranian people indigenous to Khuzestan. He called them \"... a very deprived group ... living in conditions of high density, again without access to adequate sanitation and water. And just nearby, you see other neighbourhoods with much better services.\"\n\nKothari's description of the position of the Laks suggests that economic marginalisation in Khuzestan is not only experienced by Khuzestani Arabs, but also other ethnic groups who are indigenous to the area.\n\nKothari's findings led to condemnation of forced displacement of Khuzestani Arabs in a European Parliament resolution, passed in October 2005. The resolution, sponsored by all the European Parliament's political groups,\n\nThe European Parliament unanimously passed a resolution in November 2006 which repeated its condemnation of forced displacement in Khuzestan, based on Kothari's findings.\n\nAlthough the majority of the population of Khuzestan is Shia, there are other religious groups in the province. The 5-10,000 Mandeans, a unique religious group that is neither Muslim nor Christian, living in Khuzestan claim to have second-class status due to both Iranisation and Persianisation. Their places of worship have reportedly been closed down and their cemeteries. However, they lack any support group to lobby on their behalf and their plight is often overlooked by human rights organisations. Their small numbers also mean they are politically marginalised.\n\nSome Iranian opposition parties operating abroad launched a campaign to stop the American Enterprise Institute hosting a conference entitled \"The Unknown Iran: Another Case for Federalism?\" in October 2005. A petition to stop the event attracted more than 1,000 signatures from members of the Iranian diaspora. Some added that the meeting indicated a new alliance between US neo-conservatives and Iranian separatists, ahead of a possible invasion of Iran by the US and its allies. Dr Ali Al-Taie, a member of the Democratic Solidarity Party of Ahwaz which upholds a federalist agenda for Iran, said at the debate: \"When it comes to ethnic rights, Persian opposition groups are on the same side as the terrorist Islamic Republic. If this continues, we will see the Balkanization of Iran.\" But he added that: \"Despite the long history of persecution, the Arabs of Khuzestan/al-Ahwaz are Iranian. There will never be, nor should there be, disintegration or separatism in Iran. Rather, all Iranian people, regardless of their ethnic background, should live under a pluralistic, tolerant, and federal society.\"\n\nWith the change of regime, the 1979 Khuzestan uprising became one of the nationwide uprisings, which erupted in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution. The unrest was fed by Arab demands for autonomy. The Arab uprising was effectively quelled by Iranian security forces, resulting in more than a hundred people on both sides killed combined.\n\nThe Arab political parties are divided into two camps: those seeking a separate state and those seeking regional autonomy within a federal Iran. Critics of these parties claim that separatism has no support among Arabs, pointing to the decision by many Iranian Arabs to defend Iran during the Iran–Iraq War. The support shown by Iranian Arabs may have been a result of the knowledge of Shiite Muslims in Saddam's Iraq. They also contend that separatism has always been instigated by foreign governments – particularly the British – to weaken Iran in order to control the country's natural resources and extend their influence over the Middle East. Many make no distinction between separatists and federalists, claiming that those seeking federalism have a separatist agenda and that the devolution of power to regional ethnic groups would lead to the break-up of Iran.\n\nThe Democratic Solidarity Party of Al-Ahwaz (DSPA), based in the US and the UK,claiming to represent the Iranian Arabs of Khuzestan. The DSPA's ideology is different from the separatists in that it explicitly rejects the use of violence and advocates what it calls \"internal self-determination\". It also limits its territorial focus on Khuzestan, making no stand on Arab-populated living outside the province.\n\nThe DSPA claims that Khuzestan has a historical Arab identity and this means that the province should be given autonomy within a federal political system, but it says it respects Iran's territorial integrity. To achieve its ends, it has formed a coalition with like-minded parties representing Kurds, Azeris, Baluchis, Turkmen, Bakhtiaris and Lurs, some of which have been in armed conflict with the Iranian state. Formed in London in March 2005, the Congress of Iranian Nationalities for a Federal Iran (CINFI) brought together the DSPA, the Baluchistan United Front, Federal Democratic Movement of Azarbaijan, Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Baluchistan People's Party, Organization for Defense of the Rights of Turkmen People and Komalah, a militant Kurdish opposition party.\n\nThe Ahwaz Liberation Organisation (ALO), based in Maastricht in the Netherlands, was formed out of the remnants of three Iraqi-backed groups – the Democratic Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Arabistan (DRFLA), People's Front for Liberation of Arabistan (PFLA) and the Arab Front for the Liberation of Al-Ahwaz (AFLA). It is a secular pan-Arabist group seeking independence from Iran. The DRFLA was the most notorious, having been sponsored by Saddam Hussein.\n\nIt was founded after the newly installed Islamic government fired on Arab demonstrators in Khorramshahr, killing many of them. The DRFLA was behind the May 1980 Iranian Embassy Siege in London, taking a number of hostages in an effort to draw attention to its demands for the self-determination of the Arab population of Khuzestan. The British Special Air Service (SAS) stormed the building and freed the hostages. Fowzi Badavi Nejad, the only survivor of that group, had survived only because some of the embassy hostages had put themselves between him and the SAS soldiers. Some evidences indicated the Iraqi intelligence services had duped Nejad into taking part in the siege. The evidence showed that once he knew the true nature of the group's plans, he only continued because he feared that his family, who had fled from Iran to Iraq, would suffer if he tried to withdraw the last hostage.\n\nThe ALO's constituent groups operated as a mercenary force on behalf of Saddam's regime during the Iran–Iraq War, carrying out assassinations and attacking oil facilities. Bomb attacks on oil and power facilities have continued since the end of the Iraq War, although the ALO has not formally claimed responsibility. The ALO's leader, the self-styled \"President of Al-Ahwaz\" Faleh Abdallah Al-Mansouri, was living in exile in the Netherlands since 1989, shortly after the end of the Iran–Iraq War, gaining Dutch nationality. He declared himself to be the \"President\" of Al-Ahwaz, which he claims extends beyond Khuzestan, including much of the coast of Iran. However, during a visit to Syria in May 2006, he was arrested in Syria in May 2006 along with Iranian Arabs who were registered as refugees by the UNHCR. Although the Iranian government did not name the men who were taken into custody, officials said that the men arrested in Syria were Salafists who they accused of involvement in bomb attacks. However, the ALO's website makes no indication that it is motivated by a religious cause, but rather has stayed within the ideology of secular Arab nationalism.\n\nThe editor of Ahvaz's Persian language \"Hamsayeha\" newspaper, Mohammad Hezbawi (also known as Hezbaee Zadeh), was arrested in September 2005 but later released. The newspaper was banned by the Justice Department in February 2006 under clauses four and five of Article 6 of Iran's Press law.\n\nTelevision broadcasting in Arabic language in Khuzestan is state-owned (e.g. Al Alam) as is the case in other parts of the country, but many inhabitants also watch foreign Arabic language satellite channels. The Qatar-based Al-Jazeera news channel was blamed by the Iranian government for its coverage of anti-government protests by Arabs in April 2005. It was also angered by Al-Jazeera's interview with a member of the separatist Ahwazi Democratic Popular Front (ADPF) who spoke of \"80 years of Iranian occupation in Khuzestan\". The International Federation of Journalists claimed the government was scapegoating the media for civil unrest in the province.\n\nIn recent years, Iranian Arab groups have attempted to broadcast to Khuzestan. However, their attempts have been frustrated partly due to satellite dish confiscation in Khuzestan. Different political factions have run short weekly or daily television broadcasts to Iran, but these have closed down.\n\nKhuzestan has tended to elect reformists to power, particularly those campaigning on a pro-minorities platform. However, bomb attacks in the region have led to a polarisation of opinion, with some Khuzestan representatives such as Ahwaz City representative Nasser Soudani calling for hardline measures against Arab dissent, which the government believes is being encouraged by British spies.\n\nIn the first round of the presidential election, Khuzestani voters favoured reformist candidate Mehdi Karroubi, who is a strong critic of the Guardian Council, who only achieved third place nationally. Karroubi's share of the vote in Khuzestan was twice the national average. Former president Rafsanjani came second in Khuzestan, although he achieved the highest number of votes nationally, followed by conservative Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was the overall winner of the second round of the presidential election.\n\nShabib Jouijari won a by-election for the Ahvaz parliamentary seat in December 2006, with 17.9% of the 406,808 votes cast.\n\nKhuzestan has six directly elected representatives in the 86-member Assembly of Experts, which is normally elected every eight years and has the power the select and supervise the Supreme Leader. The most recent elections were held in December 2006, with members appointed for 10-year terms\n\nSummary of the December 2006 Iranian Assembly of Experts election results for Khuzestan province\n\nThe 2006 Ahwaz City elections were won by reformist and conservative candidates. The previous elections to the municipality were won by the Reconciliation Committee (Lejnat Al-Wefaq), which won all but one of the seats. It appealed to the city's Arab population and their grievances. However, it was barred from registering and was outlawed by the government, which alleged that it was a threat to national security. Candidates for the 2006 elections were subject to a heavy vetting procedure before they were allowed to stand.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was so named because much of the line was near the Pacific Ocean, within less than 100 feet (30 m) in places. The tracks are now owned by the Southern California Regional Rail Authority and the North County Transit District, and hosts Metrolink's Orange County Line and Inland Empire–Orange County Line, the San Diego Coaster, and Amtrak \"Pacific Surfliner\" passenger trains. The BNSF Railway operates freight over the line using trackage rights.\n\nConstruction of the Surf Line between Los Angeles and San Diego began on October 12, 1880, with the organization of the California Southern Railroad Company. On January 2, 1882, the California Southern commenced passenger and freight service between National City and Fallbrook Junction, just north of Oceanside. From Oceanside the line turned northeast for a winding route through the Temecula Canyon, and was finished on August 21, 1882.\n\nThe line became part of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad's transcontinental rail line in 1885 via an extension of the California Southern from Colton north over the Cajon Pass to Barstow. From 1886 to 1888, the Riverside, Santa Ana and Los Angeles Railway built a branch from Highgrove southwest via Riverside to Santa Ana and from Orange (just north of Santa Ana) northwest to Los Angeles. Also in 1888 the San Bernardino and San Diego Railway completed its line from Oceanside north to Santa Ana, completing what was originally called the Los Angeles-San Diego Short Line. The now-downgraded old route was destroyed by floods in 1891 and the new line, later named the Surf Line, was now the only line to San Diego from the north.\n\nIn 1910, the Fullerton and Richfield Railway built a short cutoff of the San Bernardino-Los Angeles route from Atwood west to Fullerton, giving the Surf Line its northern terminus of Fullerton. \n\nFor much of the 20th century, the Surf Line (officially, the Fourth District of the Los Angeles Division) was to the Santa Fe what the New York City–Philadelphia corridor was to the Pennsylvania Railroad. Daily traffic could reach a density of ten trains (each way) during the summer months. The route hosted AT&SF \"San Diegan\" passenger trains, renamed the \"Pacific Surfliner\" by Amtrak in 2000. \n\nThe Santa Fe installed Centralized traffic control in 1943–1944 which increased capacity on the line. In the 1990s the SCRRA (Southern California Regional Rail Authority, also known as Metrolink) and the San Diego Northern Railway (Coaster) bought the sections of the line in Orange and San Diego Counties and began operating commuter trains.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the segment from the Orange County line to the Santa Fe Depot in downtown San Diego has been double-tracked. As one of the nation's busiest corridors, local transportation and planning agencies want to complete the entire section.\n\nThese are not all the stations that currently operate. Many of these stations no longer exist (i.e. Linda Vista) and new ones have opened (i.e. Sorrento Valley). For a list of stations that currently operate, see the articles for Metrolink's Orange County Line and the Coaster.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1827917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827917", "title": "Callippic cycle", "text": "Callippic cycle\n\nFor astronomy and calendar studies, the Callippic cycle (or Calippic) is a particular approximate common multiple of the year (specifically the tropical year) and the synodic month, that was proposed by Callippus during 330 BC. It is a period of 76 years, as an improvement of the 19-year Metonic cycle.\n\nA century before Callippus, Meton had discovered the cycle in which 19 years equals 235 lunations. If we assume a year is about days, 19 years total about 6940 days, which exceeds 235 lunations by almost a third of a day, and 19 tropical years by four tenths of a day. It implicitly gave the solar year a duration of = 365 + = 365 + + days = 365 d 6 h 18 min 56 s. Callippus accepted the 19-year cycle, but held that the duration of the year was more closely days (= 365 d 6 h), so he multiplied the 19-year cycle by 4 to obtain an integer number of days, and then omitted 1 day from the last 19-year cycle. Thus, he computed a cycle of 76 years that consists of 940 lunations and 27,759 days, which has been named the \"Callippic\" cycle after him. Although the cycle's error has been computed as one full day in 553 years, or 4.95 parts per million.\n\nThe first year of the first Callippic cycle began at the summer solstice of 330 BC (28 June in the proleptic Julian calendar), and was subsequently used by later astronomers. In Ptolemy's \"Almagest\", for example, he cites (\"Almagest\" VII 3, H25) observations by Timocharis during the 47th year of the first Callippic cycle (283 BC), when on the eighth of Anthesterion, the Pleiades star cluster was occulted by the Moon.\n\nThe Callippic calendar originally used the names of months from the Attic calendar. Later astronomers, such as Hipparchus, preferred other calendars, including the ancient Egyptian calendar. Also Hipparchus invented his own Hipparchic calendar cycle as an improvement upon the Callippic cycle. Ptolemy's \"Almagest\" provided some conversions between the Callippic and Egyptian calendars, such as that Anthesterion 8, 47th year of the first Callippic period was equivalent to day 29 of the month of Athyr, during year 465 of Nabonassar. However, the original, complete form of the Callippic calendar is no longer known.\n\nOne Callippic cycle corresponds to:\n\nThe 80 eclipse years means that if there is a solar eclipse (or lunar eclipse), then after one callippic cycle a New Moon (resp. Full Moon) will take place at the same node of the orbit of the Moon, and under these circumstances another eclipse can occur.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1827918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827918", "title": "Hipparchic cycle", "text": "Hipparchic cycle\n\nThe Greek astronomer Hipparchus introduced two cycles that have been named after him in later literature.\n\nHipparchus proposed a correction to the Calippic cycle (of 76 years), which itself was proposed as a correction to the Metonic cycle (of 19 years). He may have published it in the book \"On the Length of the Year\" (Περὶ ἐνιαυσίου μεγέθους), which is lost. From solstice observations, Hipparchus found that the tropical year is about of a day shorter than the days that Calippus used (see \"Almagest\" III.1). So he proposed to make a 1-day correction after 4 Calippic cycles, such that 304 years = 3760 lunations = 111035 days. This is a very decent approximation for an integer number of lunations in an integer number of days (error only 0.014 days). But it is in fact 1.37 days longer than 304 tropical years: the mean tropical year is actually about day (11 minutes 15 seconds) shorter than the Julian calendar year of days. These differences cannot be corrected with any cycle that is a multiple of the 19-year cycle of 235 lunations: it is an accumulation of the mismatch between years and months in the basic Metonic cycle, and the lunar months need to be shifted systematically by a day with respect to the solar year (\"i.e.\" the Metonic cycle itself needs to be corrected) after every 228 years.\nIndeed, from the values of the tropical year (365.2421896698 days) and the synodic month (29.530588853) cited in the respective articles of Wikipedia, it follows that the length of 228=12*19 tropical years is about 83275.22 days, shorter than the length of 12*235 synodic months, namely about 83276.26 days, by one day plus about one hour. In fact, an even better correction would be to correcting by two days every 437 years, rather than one day every 228 years. The length of 437=23*19 tropical years, about 159610.837 days, is shorter than that of 23*235 synodic months, about 159612.833 days, by almost exactly two days, up to only six minutes.\n\nIt corresponds to:\n\nAn eclipse cycle constructed by Hipparchus is described in Ptolemy's \"Almagest\" IV.2. Hipparchus constructed a cycle by multiplying by 17 a cycle due to the Chaldean astronomer Kidinnu, so as to closely match an integer number of synodic months (4267), anomalistic months (4573), years (345), and days (126007 + about 1 hour); it is also close to a half-integer number of draconic months (4630.53...). By comparing his own eclipse observations with Babylonian records from 345 years earlier, he could verify the accuracy of the various periods that the Chaldean astronomers used. \n\nThe Hipparchic eclipse cycle is made up of 25 inex minus 21 saros periods. There are only three or four eclipses in a series of eclipses separated by Hipparchic cycles. For example, the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017 was preceded by one in 1672 and will be followed by one in 2362, but there are none before or after these.\n"}

(Although the Toronto Transit Commission has ordered the Flexity Outlook Cityrunner for its legacy system, Metrolinx has ordered the Flexity Freedom for Toronto's new Eglinton Crosstown line that is under construction along Eglinton Avenue in mid-Toronto.)\nWhile most Flexity Outlook trams are bi-directional, the Toronto cars are single-ended in order to meet the operating requirements of that city's legacy streetcar routes. Bombardier has built single-ended Flexity Outlook versions for cities including Graz, Łódź and Milan.\n\nThe Flexity Outlook Cityrunner has a modular design, allowing it to be customised for use on networks that require narrow vehicles or nearly unique tight curve radii, down to in the case of Toronto. Toronto's version of the Outlook is gauged to fit its legacy streetcar lines, with a track gauge of .\n\nIts closest competitors are the Citadis from Alstom, the Combino and S70 from Siemens, and Bombardier's other Flexity trams.\n\nBombardier Transportation operated a Flexity Outlook demo system in Vancouver from January 21 to March 21, 2010, coinciding with the 2010 Winter Olympics. The trams were on loan from a fleet of Flexity Outlook series made for the Brussels tram network. The service was called the Olympic Line and used electrified railway right-of-way owned by the City of Vancouver and not part of the regional transit authority (TransLink).\n\nThe temporary line operated from Granville Island to near Olympic Village Station on the Canada Line at 2nd Avenue. Service consisted of a link with two stations, with cars operating every 10 minutes.\n\n\n"}

It was released in the United States in January 1969 on Epic Records, catalogue BXN 26439 in stereo, and in the United Kingdom in March 1969 on Pye Records, catalogue NPL 18283 in mono and NSPL 18283 in stereo. \"Donovan's Greatest Hits\" peaked at #4 on the Billboard 200, and has been certified platinum by the RIAA.\n\nThe album was included in Robert Christgau's \"Basic Record Library\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in \"\" (1981).\n\n\"Donovan's Greatest Hits\" is a distinct entry in Donovan's discography for several reasons. First, it collects three singles that were previously unreleased on any album: \"Epistle to Dippy\"; \"There Is a Mountain\"; and \"Laléna.\" It also presents the unedited \"Sunshine Superman\" (one minute and fifteen seconds longer than the original 1966 single and LP release), and most of the songs appear for the first time in stereo. Lastly, \"Donovan's Greatest Hits\" contains re-recordings of \"Catch the Wind\" and \"Colours\" with Big Jim Sullivan playing guitar, John Paul Jones on bass and keyboards and Clem Cattini on drums. Epic Records could not obtain the right to release the original recordings of these two songs, so Donovan recorded new versions in May 1968 with a full backing band and a lavish production by Mickie Most.\n\n\"Donovan's Greatest Hits\" marked the high point of Donovan's popularity in both the United States and United Kingdom. It also most likely had the effect of keeping many of Donovan's recordings on the shelf to avoid oversaturating the market. Nearly all of Donovan's next studio album was already recorded by the time of this release but remained unreleased until August 1969.\n\nIn 1987, the original album was issued on compact disc by Epic Records in North America (EK 26439) and Epic/Sony Records in Japan (28·8P-1033), with the two sides of the original LP reversed. On March 30, 1999, Epic Legacy reissued a remastered version of the album (EK 65730), which substitutes the original versions of \"Catch the Wind\" and \"Colours\" in place of the 1968 remakes and adds four bonus tracks which became hits after the album was first released.\n\n\"All tracks by Donovan Leitch. On NSPL 18283, \"Season of the Witch\" is the first track on side two.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since 2015, it has been represented by Ruth Cadbury of the Labour Party. \n\n1974–1983: The London Borough of Hounslow wards of Clifden, Gunnersbury, Homefields, Hounslow Central, Hounslow South, Isleworth North, Isleworth South, Riverside, Spring Grove, and Turnham Green.\n\n1983–1997: The above wards as renamed: Brentford Clifden, Chiswick Homefields, Chiswick Riverside, Gunnersbury, Hounslow Central, Hounslow South, Isleworth North, Isleworth South, Spring Grove, and Turnham Green.\n\n1997–2010: As above plus Hounslow West.\n\n2010–present: Wards in the same borough: Brentford, Chiswick Homefields, Chiswick Riverside, Hounslow Central, Hounslow Heath, Hounslow South, Isleworth, Osterley and Spring Grove, Syon, and Turnham Green.\n\nThe seat is a mixture of very suburban London and urban district centres with many differing heights and types of homes. It stretches along the north bank of the Thames and then to the west, encompassing the London districts (former villages) of Chiswick, most of Hounslow, Isleworth (from Old Isleworth to Osterley) and former market town of Brentford.\n\nThe seat is affluent nearest the Thames and Osterley Park yet has a few tall tower blocks and other council housing set back from it in parts of Isleworth and Brentford. Brentford has a wide range and long history of social housing which is mostly, by a narrow margin, private housing following the 1980s Right to Buy reform. Locally, 21st century development includes a large proportion of shared ownership and housing authority homes. The seat has more unemployment (11.7% in 2017) than London (5.3%) or the UK (4.4%) overall. About three wards make up Hounslow in the west and two Brentford in the centre which excluding its expensive Quay and North Quarter parts have an above-average rank in the Index of Multiple Deprivation, many homes affordable for workers on lower incomes and are generally strong for the Labour Party. In the far east are three Chiswick wards that return Conservative councillors. Chiswick's large public sector economic component and relatively young profile for a wealthy area sees a three-way or broader split in its general election votes. The only part of the seat with a London postcode - W4 it abounds with high-income office workers, small-to-mid-size business directors and senior governmental workers. Its parks, gardens, long Thames riverside, proximity to Hammersmith, its united Piccadilly and District tube lines and housing stock mean it resembles the Richmond Park seat socio-economically. The wards of Osterley, Spring Grove and Hounslow South have long alternated between, or generate a split result between, Conservative and Labour councillors and there is no incontrovertible evidence to prove if they lean more to the left of their local results in general elections.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats (including their two predecessor parties) took their largest share of the vote here in 2010 but their return, seldom, of local councillors means the party fell almost 10 points below a one-third share of the votes in what was essentially a three-candidate race.\n\nThe Green Party kept its deposits in three of the four contests before 2017. In the election that year it chose not to field a candidate, in order to help Labour defend its 400-vote majority.\n\nBrentford FC's Griffin Park ground is within the seat, as is Fuller's brewery and various headquarters of multinational and market-leading domestic companies including GlaxoSmithKline and BSkyB. The districts have tube or rail services east to London and west (to Heathrow Airport, Ealing and/or Weybridge) which are major centres of employment.\n\nFrom 1979 until 2015 the seat proved to be a national bellwether. The 2015 result gave the seat the 4th most marginal majority of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority. During the seat's existence the two largest parties nationally have jostled for the winning candidate.\n\nIn 2010 Council seats split evenly (15—15) between the two main parties reflecting the result of the general election held on the same day, where the seat was narrowly gained by the Conservatives. From 1998-2001 three wards of the centre of the constituency saw the Independent Community Group have councillors, seven at their greatest. These wards were taken by Labour in 2010. \n\nLabour added Hounslow South in 2014 and took one of the three Osterley and Spring Grove seats leaving them with 19 seats and the Conservatives with 11. In 2018, Labour gained the remaining Conservative seats in Osterley and Spring Grove, which gave Labour 21 to the Conservatives on 9.\n\nThe constituency was created in 1974, mostly replacing the former seat of Brentford and Chiswick.\n\n\n"}

A national swing against the Conservatives in 1997 (-11.2%, compared to -16.2% locally) ended their three terms of widely-perceived \"strong\" or \"safe\" Conservative victories (the lowest majority seen by outgoing MP Nigel Forman was 18.9% of the vote in 1992). \n\nLater results soon disproved assumptions of it being a safe seat for the Liberal Democrats, who had retained it since 1997. Following their role in the coalition government, there was a large swing against the party nationally, and no other seat in the southern half of England, aside from North Norfolk, was retained by a Liberal Democrat in 2015. This transformed the constituency into one the party's eight most secure seats, by virtue of those eight being the few retained by the party. The result placed Carshalton and Wallington ahead of seats the party lost that had returned a Liberal Democrat or Liberal for decades, such as Truro and St Austell, its member (or that for its direct predecessor version, Truro) having had the party's allegiance since 1974. In 2019, this seat was one of several Liberal Democrat seats gained by the Conservatives, in an election which saw two seats change hands in the opposite direction. Brake, the losing incumbent, was the Liberal Democrats' spokesman on Brexit. The party had fiercely campaigned against Britain's departure from the European Union; however, this seat voted to leave in the 2016 referendum.\n\n1983–2010: The London Borough of Sutton wards of Beddington North, Beddington South, Carshalton Beeches, Carshalton Central, Carshalton North, Clockhouse, St Helier North, St Helier South, Wallington North, Wallington South, Wandle Valley, Woodcote, and Wrythe Green.\n\n2010–present: The London Borough of Sutton wards of Beddington North, Beddington South, Carshalton Central, Carshalton South and Clockhouse, St Helier, The Wrythe, Wallington North, Wallington South, and Wandle Valley.\n\n\n"}

Its MP since 2011 is Seema Malhotra of the Labour Co-operative Party, which is in political union with the Labour Party.\n\nThe seat has been confined throughout to the western electoral half of the London Borough of Hounslow. Its main predecessor seat was Feltham, comprising Feltham, Bedfont, Hanworth, Hounslow Heath and Cranford; the other direct forerunner Heston and Isleworth contributed its former westernmost settlements: Heston and Hounslow West. Before 1945 about a third of the present area and half of its then-population were in the Twickenham seat (formed in 1885), the remainder, Feltham, Hanworth and Bedfont were in the Spelthorne seat (formed in 1918 from the southern part of Uxbridge (UK Parliament constituency)).\n\nProximity of gravel to the surface of the near-flat land — see Hounslow Heath — restricted productivity and diversity of plant life across the constituency and caused initially cheap land values, a factor which led the area to significant industrial use since the mid-19th century and construction of London Heathrow Airport, the area's largest employer including its many import/export businesses. The area at central Feltham and on the busy and the somewhat slower (to Central London) Piccadilly line at two tube stations in the north connects into London and the latter also connects to Heathrow Airport.\n\nThis part of the Borough of Hounslow since 1955 has the great majority of its of Metropolitan Green Belt, forming an immediate buffer zone for all of Greater London. The M4 motorway and dualled parts of the A4, A30 and A316 roads run close to a significant minority of homes. Many local initiatives seek to abate pollution in the Borough and other have successfully attracted major retail and leisure into Feltham and Hounslow, both of which were large villages rather than market towns in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe seat has been held by the Labour Party from 1992 onwards, with their highest share of the vote being 35% in 2001, and lowest share being 3.3%, in 1992. The Conservatives have finished in second place at each general election since.\n\nThe current MP Seema Malhotra (Labour Co-operative) was first elected at the 2011 by-election after the death of the previous Labour MP Alan Keen, who had won the seat from Patrick Ground of the Conservatives in 1992.\n\nToday, the seat is a reasonably safe seat for the Labour Party. Although Labour’s majority was halved in the 2019 election, the seat was still retained by nearly 8,000 votes.\n\nFeltham and Heston covers the western half of the London Borough of Hounslow. Feltham occupies the southern part of the L-shape formed by the borough. Heston occupies the far north bounded by the M4 motorway. In the south of the constituency is Hanworth, with Bedfont in the far west — both are postally parts of Feltham.\n\nThe seat has electoral wards: \n\nThe London Borough of Hounslow's eastern half is the Brentford and Isleworth seat.\n\nThe constituency is lower on the socio-economic scales than those in neighbouring Brentford and Isleworth. There is higher proportion of social housing, though unemployment is proportionally low by London standards. The seat also includes the western part of the slightly larger urban centre, Hounslow.\n\nThe constituency is to the northwest of London Heathrow Airport where many local constituents work, and small storage, distribution businesses are a feature of this half of the borough, as well as light industry and office accommodation. Next to Cranford on the A4 Bath Road are most of the luxury airport hotels, and an imposing 1998 conversion of an office tower into a hotel in Feltham's linear town centre. The seat includes a Young Offenders Institution, small business and industrial park and a motorway service station. Across all wards, car ownership is much higher than the London average; for the small proportion of people (who work in the City), Feltham railway station, Hounslow West Underground station, Hounslow Central Underground station and Hatton Cross Underground station provide good links from several areas to the capital.\n\n\n"}
