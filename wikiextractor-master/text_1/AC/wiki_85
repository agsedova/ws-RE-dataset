{"id": "2163440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163440", "title": "Ruff (clothing)", "text": "Ruff (clothing)\n\nA ruff is an item of clothing worn in Western, Central and Northern Europe from the mid-sixteenth century to the mid-seventeenth century. The round and flat variation is often called a millstone collar after its resemblance to that object.\n\nThe ruff, which was worn by men, women and children, evolved from the small fabric ruffle at the drawstring neck of the shirt or chemise. They served as changeable pieces of cloth that could themselves be laundered separately while keeping the wearer's doublet or gown from becoming soiled at the neckline. The stiffness of the garment forced upright posture, and their impracticality led them to become a symbol of wealth and status.\n\nRuffs were primarily made from linen cambric, stiffened with starch imported from the Low Countries. Later ruffs were also sometimes made entirely from lace. However, lace was expensive since it was a new fabric, developed in the early sixteenth century.\n\nThe size of the ruff increased as the century went on. \"Ten yards is enough for the ruffs of the neck and hand\" for a New Year's gift made by her ladies for Queen Elizabeth in 1565, but the discovery of starch allowed ruffs to be made wider without losing their shape. Later ruffs were separate garments that could be washed, starched, and set into elaborate figure-of-eight folds by the use of heated cone-shaped goffering irons. Ruffs were often coloured during starching, vegetable dyes were used to give the ruff a yellow, pink or mauve tint. A pale blue colour could also be obtained via the use of smalt, although Elizabeth I took against this colour and issued a royal prerogative: \"Her Majesty's pleasure is that no blue starch shall be used or worn by any of her Majesty's subjects, since blue was the colour of the flag of Scotland ...\"\n\nSetting and maintaining the structured and voluminous shape of the ruff could be extremely difficult due to changes in body heat or weather. For this reason, they could be worn only once before losing their shape. At their most extreme, ruffs were a foot or more wide; these \"cartwheel ruffs\" required a wire frame called a \"supportasse\" or \"underpropper\" to hold them at the fashionable angle. Ruffs could make it difficult to eat during mealtimes, similar to the cangue. By the start of the seventeenth century, ruffs were falling out of fashion in Western Europe, in favour of wing collars and falling bands. The fashion lingered longer in the Dutch Republic, where ruffs can be seen in portraits well into the seventeenth century, and farther east. It also stayed on as part of the ceremonial dress of city councillors (\"Senatoren\") in North German Hanseatic cities and of Lutheran clergy in those cities and in Denmark, Norway, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland.\n\nThe ruff was banned in Spain under Philip IV (orchestrated by Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares).\n\nRuffs remain part of the formal attire of bishops and ministers in the Church of Denmark (including Greenland) and the Church of the Faroe Islands and are generally worn for services. The Church of Norway removed the ruff from its clergy uniform in 1980, although some conservative ministers, such as Børre Knudsen, continued to wear them. Ruffs are optional for trebles in Anglican church choirs. The judges of the Constitutional Court of Italy wear a robe with an elementar ruff in the neck. Underground artist Klaus Nomi used a ruff as part of his concert attire toward the end of his life, both to complement the Renaissance-era music he focused on during his late career, and to hide the Kaposi's sarcoma lesions on his neck. In the twentieth century, the ruff inspired the name of the Elizabethan collar for animals.\n\n\n\n"}

He is universally referred to by \"rebetiko\" writers and fans simply by his first name, Márkos. The great significance of Vamvakaris for the rebetiko is also reflected by his nickname: the \"patriarch of the rebetiko\".\n\nVamvakaris was born on 10 May 1905 in Ano Syros (or Ano Khora), Syros, Greece. He was the first of six children, while his family belonged to the sizeable Roman Catholic community of the island, the \"Francosyrians\", a name deriving from the colloquial Greek reference to West Europeans collectively as \"the Franks\".\n\nAt the age of twelve, in the false belief that he was wanted by the police, Vamvakaris fled Syros for the port of Piraeus. He worked as a stevedore, a pit-coal miner, a shoe-polisher, a paperboy, a butcher, and other odd jobs. He heard a bouzouki player playing, and vowed that if he did not learn to play the instrument in six months he would chop off his own hand with a cleaver (he was working in the public abattoirs at the time). He learned bouzouki, becoming an innovative virtuoso player, and began to write songs of his own. At first he often played in clandestine hashish-smoking establishments known as \"tekés\"; later he and his band, which included Giorgos Batis, Anestis Delias and Stratos Pagioumtzis played in more legitimate clubs and taverns. They were extremely popular, and Markos made many recordings. His initial nickname among the rebetes was \"the Frank\" (Fragos).\n\nSpyros Peristeris, a well-educated musician and repertory manager and orchestra leader for several recording companies, persuaded Vamvakaris to record his songs sung with his own voice. Vamvakaris recorded his first rebetiko disc, \"Na'rchósouna re magka mou\" (\"Να 'ρχόσουνα ρε μάγκα μου\") in 1932. Among other songs in that period, he wrote the classic love song \"\"Frankosyriani\"\" (\"Φραγκοσυριανή\").\n\nAfter the liberation of Greece from the occupation of Nazi Germany, difficult times persisted, but his kind of music was no longer fashionable. He also suffered badly with arthritis in his hands which crippled his bouzouki playing, and from asthma that hampered his singing. The slump in his fortunes lasted until the early 1960s when, after initiatives by Vassilis Tsitsanis, many of his old songs were revived and sung by singers including Grigoris Bithikotsis, and Stratos Dionysiou. Vamvakaris died on 8 February 1972 at the age of 66.\n\nMarkos' composing style was utterly simple: minimal orchestration, melodic lines stripped of any embellishment, and lyrics as devoid of ornamentation as possible. His strophic masterpiece \"\"Your eyelashes shine\"\" is a typical example of his art. It consists of just three short couplets, each sung twice to the same melodic phrase, with clauses reversed for the second time, and with a single instrumental phrase interspersed between them: \nAs the years pass, his towering contribution to Greek music emerges. All other Greek composers, of his time and afterwards, revere him as their master teacher, and Mikis Theodorakis remarked: \"\"We all, we are but branches of a tree. Markos is that tree\"\".\n\nMarkos may be heard on many of the anthology CDs listed in the rebetiko discography. CDs of his own which may be available in English language countries include:\n\nMarkos married his first wife with a Catholic marriage. After their divorce (for which he wrote a song), he married his second wife, Evangelia, with a Greek Orthodox marriage. He had three sons: Vasilis, Stelios (a musician also) and Dominikos.\n\nStavros Xarchakos and Nikos Gatsos wrote a song called \"Gramma sto Marko Vamvakari\" (Letter to Markos Vamvakaris, Greek: Γράμμα στο Μάρκο Βαμβακάρη), sung by George Dalaras and actress Despo Diamantidou. Also, Thodoros Derveniotis and Kostas Virvos wrote \"Markos\", sung by Kaiti Abavi. Markos Vamvakaris is also mentioned in the following songs:\n\n\n"}

Weiland, and a smaller French fleet, under the Bailli de Suffren, off the coast of India during the American Revolutionary War. This war sparked the Second Mysore War in India. In the battle, taking place near Cuddalore on 20 June 1783, Suffren commanded the engagement from the frigate \"Cléopâtre\" and won what is generally considered a victory. Peace had already been agreed upon in Europe, but that news had yet to reach India, making this the final battle of the war.\n\nOn the death of French ally Hyder Ali, the British decided to retake Cuddalore. They marched troops from Madras, and began preparing for a siege. The French fleet, under Suffren, appeared at Cuddalore on 13 June. A week of fickle winds prevented either side from engaging until 20 June, when Suffren attacked. No ships were seriously damaged, but each side lost about 100 men with around 400 wounded. The British fleet retreated to Madras after the action, preventing the landing of transports carrying additional troops en route to Cuddalore to reinforce the siege. A sortie from the town weakened the British forces, which were likely to have raised the siege when word of peace officially arrived at Cuddalore on 29 June.\n\nFollowing the December 1782 death of French ally Hyder Ali, the ruler of Mysore and previous controller of Cuddalore, British commanders at Madras decided to attempt the recapture of Cuddalore. The army marched south from Madras, circling around the city then encamping south of it. The British fleet, eighteen ships of the line under Admiral Sir Edward Hughes, anchored to the south of Cuddalore in order to protect the army and its supply ships. By early June 1783, the Siege of Cuddalore was under way.\n\nFrench Admiral Suffren was ordered on 10 June to sail with his smaller fleet of fifteen ships from Trincomalee to support the besieged city. When he arrived, Hughes, who sought to avoid battle, moved away from the city and again anchored. After five days of adverse winds, Suffren was able to anchor near the city, where he made contact with the city's commander, Sayed Sahib of Mysore. Since it appeared that the success of the siege would be decided by naval action, 1,200 troops were embarked onto Suffren's ships to increase his gunnery complement. His fleet weighed anchor on 18 June, and the two fleets began maneuvering for advantage.\n\nBoth fleets were at first frustrated by light and variable winds. When a consistent west wind developed on 20 June, Hughes lined-up for battle on a northward-trending port tack and awaited Suffren's action. Lining-up in a similar formation, Suffren gave to the order to attack, and battle was engaged shortly after four in the afternoon. The action lasted about three hours resulting in no major damage to ships in either fleet, despite all ships being engaged.\n\nSuffren's fleet anchored about 25 nautical miles north of Cuddalore after the battle, while Hughes anchored near the city. On 22 June, Hughes sighted the French fleet while he was en route to Madras; a number of his ships had been disabled, and he reported that many men were suffering from scurvy and that he was short of water.\n\nSuffren returned to Cuddalore on 23 June, forcing the British supply fleet to withdraw. In addition to returning the 1,200 troops he had borrowed from the city's garrison, he landed an additional 2,400 men to support the defense. A sortie from the city was repelled but weakened the besieging British, and on 29 June a British ship flying under a truce flag brought news of a preliminary peace agreement between the two nations, resulting in a mutually-agreed suspension of hostilities on 2 July.\n\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\n"}

A panel consists of a single drawing depicting a frozen moment. When multiple panels are present, they are often, though not always, separated by a short amount of space called a gutter.\n\nNewspaper daily strips typically consist of either four panels (\"Doonesbury\", \"For Better or For Worse\") or three panels (\"Garfield\", \"Dilbert\"). These panels may all be of the same size, but many skilled cartoonists, such as Bill Waterson, Danny Vasquetto, Leonard Waldstein, Humphrey Powell, and Ginny Thomas vary the size and number of panels in each daily strip. The horizontal newspaper strip can also employ only a\nsingle panel, as sometimes seen in Wiley Miller's \"Non Sequitur\". \n\nIn Asia, a vertical four-panel arrangement (\"yonkoma\") is common in newspapers, such as with \"Azumanga Daioh\". In a comic book or graphic novel, the shapes of panels and the number of panels on a page may vary widely.\n\nThe word panel may also refer to a cartoon consisting of a single drawing; the usage is a shortened form of \"single-panel comic\". In contrast to multi-panel strips, which may involve extended dialogue in speech balloons, a typical panel comic has only one spoken line, printed in a caption beneath the panel itself. Many panel comics are syndicated and published daily, on a newspaper page with other syndicated cartoons that are collectively known as comic strips. Major comic strips in panel format include \"The Far Side\", \"Dennis the Menace\", \"The Family Circus\", \"Ziggy\", \"Herman\" and \"Ripley's Believe It or Not\". In this context, panels are contrasted with the more common comic strip format, which consists of an actual \"strip\" of multiple drawings that tell a story in sequence.\n\nThere are two major styles used in newspaper comics, single panels and strips. Single panels are usually not broken up (though this is not always the case), and thus lack continuity. The popular \"Dennis the Menace, The Far Side, and\" \"The Family Circus\" are all single panels. Strips, on the other hand, are generally longer and shaped into a rectangle. Strips include Calvin & Hobbes, \"Peanuts,\" and \"Garfield\". J. R. Williams' long-run \"Out Our Way\" continued as a daily panel even after it expanded into a Sunday strip, \"Out Our Way with the Willets\". Jimmy Hatlo's \"They'll Do It Every Time\" was often displayed in a two-panel format with the first panel showing some deceptive, pretentious, unwitting or scheming human behavior and the second panel revealing the truth of the situation.\n\nEarly daily strips were large, often running the entire width of the newspaper, and were sometimes three or more inches high. Initially, a newspaper page included only a single daily strip, usually either at the top or the bottom of the page. By the 1920s, many newspapers had a comics page on which many strips were collected together. Over decades, the size of daily strips became smaller and smaller; until by the year 2000, four standard daily strips could fit in an area once occupied by a single daily strip.\n\nNEA Syndicate experimented briefly with a two-tier daily strip, \"Star Hawks\", but after a few years, \"Star Hawks\" dropped down to a single tier.\n\nIn Flanders, Belgium, the two-tier strip is the standard publication style of most daily by:david \"Spike and Suzy\" and \"Nero\". They appear Monday through Saturday; until 2003 there were no Sunday papers in Flanders. In the last decades, they have switched from black and white to color.\n\nSaraceni, Mario.

The granite spires of the group are a popular mountaineering destination. The Bugaboos are protected within Bugaboo Provincial Park.\n\nThe Bugaboos are located in the northwestern extreme of the Purcells in the Columbia Mountains, in the south-east of the province. The nearest towns are Radium and Golden. They are commonly subdivided into four divisions: the Bugaboo Glacier Peaks, and the Eastern, Central, and Western Spires. The nearby Vowell and Conrad Groups are usually considered separate from the Bugaboos.\n\nLocated in the snow- and rain-heavy \"Columbia Wet Belt\", this section of the Purcells is subject to heavy erosion and large, active glaciers. Originally covered in weaker rock, glaciation eventually revealed the granodiorite batholiths which form the group's distinctive spires. The surrounding rock is approximately 600 million to 1 billion years old, while the Bugaboo intrusion dates to 135 million years ago. The igneous intrusion cooled slowly, forming the crystalline structure of the hard granite found today.\n\nOriginally named the \"Nunataks\", the Bugaboo spires were first noted by a surveying expedition in the late 1800s. Mining brought the first Europeans to the region with a small, ill-fated gold rush occurring in 1895 and 1896 near Bugaboo Falls. The area was prospected and staked, but the meager deposits turned out to be mostly pyrite and galena. The name \"Bugaboo\" originated from this rush; the term was used by prospectors for a \"dead-end\".\n\nClimbers became interested in the group shortly after. In 1910, an expedition led by Thomas Longstaff and surveyor Arthur Oliver Wheeler entered the area. They were guided by renowned European climber Conrad Kain. Kain would return to the area six years later and pioneer many difficult climbing routes. The Austrian climber described his route up Bugaboo Spire as his most difficult Canadian ascent, more challenging than his celebrated route up Mount Robson, the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies. Along with Albert and Bess McCarthy and others, Kain would pioneer first ascents of North Howser, Marmolata, and Crescent Spires.\n\nLogging in the area resulted in road construction in the 1950s and 60s. This led to a new influx of climbers. Fred Beckey and Yvon Chouinard (founder of the Patagonia clothing company) established new routes on several spires. The growing popularity of the area led the BC government to establish Bugaboo Glacier Provincial Park and the Bugaboo Alpine Recreation Area in 1969. The Alpine Club of Canada constructed a large hut in 1972 to reduce environmental damage to the fragile alpine meadows below the spires.\n\nThe Bugaboos have several internationally known rock climbing routes. The \"Beckey-Chouinard\" (South Howser Spire), \"West Ridge\" (Pigeon Spire), \"Northeast Ridge\" (Bugaboo Spire), \"Snowpatch\" and \"Surf's Up\" (Snowpatch Spire) attract world-class climbers. There are both bolted and free routes throughout the group. \n\nClimbers and hikers often use the 40-person Conrad Kain hut, maintained by the Alpine Club of Canada. Located near Snowpatch Spire, the hut replaced the original fibreglass igloos placed by BC Parks. The Bugaboo Lodge, constructed in 1967, is near the eastern boundary of the park. Heli-skiing and heli-hiking are conducted from the lodge into the park. Ski touring is also popular in the group during the winter.\n\n\n"}

British casualties were 29 killed and 89 wounded, while France lost 99 killed and 321 wounded.

Whereas most professional photographers had abandoned these cameras in favor of shooting on 35 mm film with more portable cameras, Nixon preferred the format because it allowed prints to be made directly from the large format negatives, retaining the clarity and integrity of the image. Nixon has said \"When photography went to the small camera and quick takes, it showed thinner and thinner slices of time, [unlike] early photography where time seemed non-changing. I like greater chunks, myself. Between 30 seconds and a thousand of a second the difference is very large.\"\n\nHis first solo exhibition was at the Museum of Modern Art curated by John Szarkowski in 1976. Nixon’s early city views taken of Boston and New York in the mid-seventies were exhibited at one of the most influential exhibitions of the decade, \"New Topographics: Photographs of a Man-Altered Landscape\" at the George Eastman House in 1975. In the late nineties, Nixon returned to this subject matter to document Boston’s changing urban landscape during the Big Dig highway development project. In 1976, 1980, and 1987, Nixon was awarded National Endowment for the Arts Photography Fellowships. In 1977 and 1986, he was awarded Guggenheim Fellowships.\n\nNixon's subjects include schoolchildren and schools in and around Boston, people living along the Charles River near Boston and Cambridge as well as cities in the South, his family and himself, people in nursing homes, the blind, sick and dying people, and the intimacy of couples. Nixon is also well known for his work \"People With AIDS\", begun in 1987. Nixon recorded his subjects with meticulous detail in order to facilitate a connection between the viewer and the subject.\n\nIn 1975, Nixon began his project, \"The Brown Sisters\" consisting of a single portrait of his wife, Bebe, and her three sisters each year, consistently posed in the same left to right order. As of 2014, there are forty portraits altogether. The series has been shown at the St. Louis Art Museum, Museum of Modern Art, Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum, the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth the National Gallery of Art, and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston. In 2010, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston organized the exhibition \"Nicholas Nixon: Family Album\" which included \"The Brown Sisters\" series among other portraits of his wife Bebe, himself and his children Sam and Clementine.\n\nNixon gained a B.A. from the University of Michigan in 1969 and an M.F.A from the University of New Mexico in 1975. He worked as a part-time professor at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design from 1975 until March 2018.\n\nOn March 22, 2018, Nixon retired from the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in mid-semester just after an investigation into alleged inappropriate behavior was announced.

{"id": "2163477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163477", "title": "FC Red Bull Salzburg", "text": "FC Red Bull Salzburg\n\nFC Red Bull Salzburg is an Austrian football club based in Wals-Siezenheim. Their home ground is the Red Bull Arena. Due to sponsorship restrictions, the club is known as FC Salzburg and wears a modified crest when playing in UEFA competitions.\n\nThe club was known as SV Austria Salzburg, and had several sponsored names, before being bought by Red Bull GmbH in 2005 who renamed the club and changed its colours from its traditional violet and white to red and white. The change resulted in some of the team's fans forming a new club, SV Austria Salzburg.\n\nFounded in 1933, and refounded in 2005 as Red Bull Salzburg, the club won its first Bundesliga title in 1994, which was the first of three in the span of four seasons which also saw them reach the 1994 UEFA Cup final. The club has won thirteen league titles and seven Austrian Cups, the first six of which came as doubles, as well as three Austrian Supercups.\n\nFC Red Bull Salzburg was founded on 13 September 1933 as SV Austria Salzburg, after the merger of the city's two clubs, Hertha and Rapid. In 1950, the club was dissolved but re-founded later the same year. It reached the Austrian top flight in 1953, and finished 9th of 14 clubs in its first season there, avoiding relegation by five points.\n\nVienna-born Erich Probst was Salzburg's first-ever international, earning the last of his 19 Austrian caps on 27 March 1960. Adolf Macek, who made the first of his four international appearances on 9 October 1965, was the club's first local player to earn a cap for Austria.\n\nSalzburg were top-flight runners-up for the first time in the 1970–71 season, gaining 43 points to Wacker Innsbruck's 44. The club's first-ever European campaign was in the 1971–72 UEFA Cup, and it was eliminated 5–4 on aggregate by Romanian club UTA despite a 3–1 home victory in the second leg. In 1974, Salzburg reached the Austrian Cup final for the first time, losing 2–1 away to Austria Wien in the first leg before a 1–1 home draw in the second.\nIn 1978, the club's official name was changed to SV Casino Salzburg and in 1997, to SV Wüstenrot Salzburg, due to a sponsorship deal with an Austrian financial services corporation. The team often remained referred to as \"SV Austria Salzburg\".\n\nSalzburg reached their first and so far only European final, the 1994 UEFA Cup final, where they lost both legs 1–0 to Inter Milan. That same season, Salzburg won their first Bundesliga title, beating Austria Wien by 51 points to 49. The title was retained the following season as Salzburg beat Sturm Graz on goal difference. The 1995–96 season saw a drop to eighth place, one above a relegation play-off, but the club's third title in four seasons was won in 1997 as they beat holders Rapid Wien by three points.\n\nSalzburg's inaugural UEFA Champions League campaign in 1994–95 saw them reach the group stage by beating Israel's Maccabi Haifa 5–2 on aggregate. They were drawn into Group D with holders and eventual finalists Milan and eventual winners Ajax, as well as AEK Athens. Despite drawing both matches with Ajax, Salzburg picked up a solitary 3–1 win away in Athens and were eliminated in third place.\n\nThe club moved to its current stadium in 2003.\n\nThe Red Bull company purchased the club on 6 April 2005 and rebranded it. After the takeover, Red Bull changed the club's name, management, and staff, declaring \"this is a new club with no history\". Red Bull initially claimed on the club website that the club was founded in 2005, but was ordered to remove this claim by the Austrian Football Association. The new authority removed all trace of violet from the club logo and the team now play in the colours of red and white, to the consternation of much of the club's traditional support. A small pair of wings form the motif of the new club crest, displayed on the team jersey, in accordance with Red Bull's commercial slogan at the time: \"gives you wings\". This complete re-branding of the team proved very similar to Red Bull's treatment of its two Formula One racing teams, Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso. Red Bull, however, would not completely follow this precedent when it acquired the MetroStars club in Major League Soccer (MLS) in the United States; while it rebranded the team as the New York Red Bulls, it chose to recognise the MetroStars' history.\nThe traditional supporters tried to resist the radical changes and formed their own movement in order to regain some of the tradition. Several fan-clubs throughout Europe voiced their support in what they saw as a fight against the growing commercialisation of football. However, after five months of protests and talks between the club owners and traditional fans, no compromise was reached. On 15 September 2005, the \"violet\" supporters stated that the talks had irreversibly broken down and efforts to reach an agreement would be terminated.\n\nThis gave rise to two separate fan groups: the \"Red-Whites\", who support \"Red Bull Salzburg\" and the \"Violet-Whites\", who want to preserve the 72-year-old tradition and refuse to support the rebranded club. The Violet-Whites ultimately formed a new club, Austria Salzburg after viewing Red Bull's offer to maintain the original colours only for the goalkeeper's socks at away games as an insult.\n\nThe club's history going back to 1933 was later restored on the club website.\n\nIn May 2006, Red Bull announced on their website that they had hired veteran Italian coach Giovanni Trapattoni, together with his former player, German FIFA World Cup winner Lothar Matthäus, as co-trainers. The pair initially denied having reached a deal, but officially signed on 23 May 2006. Red Bull ultimately won the 2006–07 Bundesliga by a comfortable margin with five games still left in the season after drawing 2–2 with previous season's champions Austria Wien on 28 April 2007.\n\nRed Bull were beaten by Shakhtar Donetsk in the third qualifying round of the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League, and were then knocked out of the 2007–08 UEFA Cup in the first round by AEK Athens. On 13 February 2008, Giovanni Trapattoni confirmed that he would be taking over as the new Republic of Ireland national team manager in May. In his final season, the club finished as runners-up, six points behind champions Rapid Wien. Trapattoni was succeeded by Co Adriaanse, under whom they finished as champions, but he left after one year. His successor was Huub Stevens. On 14 May 2010, Stevens' Red Bull retained the Bundesliga.\n\nStevens was replaced by Dutchman Ricardo Moniz at the end of the 2010–11 season, in which Red Bull were denied a third consecutive title by Sturm Graz, who won the league by a three-point margin. Red Bull finished second in the league, and qualified for the following season's UEFA Europa League. Moniz was ordered to integrate young players from the Junior squad: at the beginning of the 2011–12 season Daniel Offenbacher, Martin Hinteregger, Georg Teigl and Marco Meilinger were promoted to the first team. In the 2011–12 season, Red Bull won the Bundesliga league title and Cup double.\n\nAfter the 2011–12 season, Moniz departed his post despite having a year remaining on his contract. The new coach for the 2012–13 season was Roger Schmidt, who came from SC Paderborn of the German 2. Bundesliga. In July 2012, Red Bull were knocked out of the Champions League in the second qualifying round against F91 Dudelange of Luxembourg, losing the first leg 1–0 away, followed by a 4–3 home win which saw the club eliminated on away goals.\n\nAfter that, the team was changed fundamentally. At the end of the transfer period, new players were purchased: Valon Berisha, Kevin Kampl, Håvard Nielsen, Sadio Mané, Isaac Vorsah, Rodnei. In the 2012–13 season, the team finished second in the league, behind champions Austria Wien. They recaptured the league title the following season with an 11-point margin over the runners-up. Also, in the 2014–15 season, they won both the Bundesliga and the cup as they did again in the 2015–16 season. In December 2014, the coach Peter Zeidler was dismissed and replaced for the last two matches in the first half of the season by Thomas Letsch. Then Óscar García took over.\n\nAlso in the next 2016–17 season, Salzburg won both the Bundesliga and the cup. In 2018, Salzburg lost the cup final against Sturm Graz. At the beginning of the 2017–18 season, Marco Rose became coach after Óscar García left the club. That season was the most successful in the club's history. In the UEFA Europa League, Salzburg reached the semi-finals in which they lost to Olympique de Marseille 2–3 on aggregate after extra time, having won during the campaign against Borussia Dortmund and Lazio.\n\nAfter eleven failed attempts to reach the group stage, Red Bull only managed to qualify directly to the 2019–20 Champions League, since the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League winner, Liverpool, qualified for the qualifying rounds via their domestic league.\n\nIn the years from 2013 to 2019 Salzburg earned 300 Mio Eur from transfers of players like Munas Dabbur, Xaver Schlager, Stefan Lainer, Hannes Wolf, Diadie Samassekou, Takumi Minamino, Erling Haaland.\n\nIn 2009, Red Bull bought an amateur club in Leipzig, Germany and re-named them RasenBallsport Leipzig (so named to circumvent local rules on corporate naming rules) with the aim of establishing a leading branded team in that country in a similar mould to its existing franchises in Salzburg and other locations. Over the next decade, Leipzig became the owners' main football project, and the close relationship between the teams was exemplified by the number of players moving between them (Georg Teigl, Marcel Sabitzer, Yordy Reyna and Stefan Ilsanker all transferred from Salzburg to Leipzig) with some of the Austrian fans becoming increasingly annoyed at their best players being signed by the 'step-sibling' club in their mission to climb through the levels of German football. There are also links between their youth systems and scouting networks.\n\nHaving finished as runners-up in their debut season in the German top flight, RB Leipzig gained entry to continental football for the first time, specifically the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League for which Red Bull Salzburg had also qualified as Austrian champions; this raised the issue of a possible conflict of interest between the clubs due to the level of influence exerted by Red Bull over both teams and the close sporting relationship between them in various aspects. After examining the operational structures during June 2017, UEFA declared themselves satisfied under their regulations that the two clubs (particularly Salzburg) were suitably independent from the Red Bull corporation, and sufficiently distinct from one another, for both to be admitted to their competitions. In the first season following that ruling, both reached the quarter-finals of the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League but did not play each other, with RB Leipzig eliminated by Olympique de Marseille who then also knocked out Salzburg in the semi-finals. However, in the next edition of the same competition, RB Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg were drawn together in Group B to meet competitively for the first time. Salzburg were the victors in both fixtures between the clubs (3–2 in Germany, 1–0 in Austria) and also won all their other matches to top the group, while Leipzig failed to progress after dropping further points against Celtic and Rosenborg.\n\nAustrian Bundesliga\n\nAustrian Cup\nAustrian Supercup\n\nAustrian First League\n\nUEFA Cup\n\n\"<nowiki>*</nowiki> as SV Austria Salzburg\"\n\nUEFA Youth League\n\n\nLegend: GF = Goals For.

Unlike most tortes, it is typically single layered like a pie or tart. It is covered by a lattice of thin dough strips placed atop the fruit. The pastry is brushed with lightly beaten egg whites, baked, and garnished with nuts.\n\nLinzer torte is a holiday treat in the Austrian, Hungarian, Swiss, German, and Tirolean traditions, often eaten at Christmas.

{"id": "2163496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163496", "title": "Cloud cuckoo land", "text": "Cloud cuckoo land\n\nCloud cuckoo land is a state of absurdly, over-optimistic fantasy or an unrealistically idealistic state where everything is perfect. Someone who is said to \"live in cloud cuckoo land\" is a person who thinks that things that are completely impossible might happen, rather than understanding how things really are. It also hints that the person referred to is naive, unaware of realities or deranged in holding such an optimistic belief.\n\nIn the modern world, a \"cloud cuckoo lander\" is defined as someone who is seen as \"crazy\" or \"strange\" by most average people, often doing or saying things that seemingly only make sense to themselves, but also exhibit cleverness at times in ways no one else would think of.\n\nCockaigne, the land of plenty in medieval myth, can be referred to as the modern day cloud cuckoo land. It was an imaginary place of extreme luxury and ease where physical comforts and pleasures were always immediately at hand and where the harshness of medieval peasant life did not exist.\n\nAristophanes, a Greek playwright, wrote and directed a drama \"The Birds\", first performed in 414 BC, in which Pisthetaerus, a middle-aged Athenian persuades the world's birds to create a new city in the sky to be named \"Nubicuculia\" or Cloud Cuckoo Land (, '), thereby gaining control over all communications between men and gods. The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer used the word (German ') in his publication \"On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason\" in 1813, as well as later in his main work \"The World as Will and Representation\" and in other places. Here, he gave it its figurative sense by reproaching other philosophers for only talking about Cloud-cuckoo-land. The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche refers to the term in his essay \"On Truth and Lying in a Nonmoral Sense.\" Author Edward Crankshaw used the term when discussing the Deak-Andrassy Plan of 1867 in his 1963 book \"The Fall of the House of Habsburg\" (Chapter 13, \"The Iron Ring of Fate\").\n\nThe phrase has been used by British and United States politicians as well as writers. Margaret Thatcher famously used this phrase in the 1980s: \"The ANC is a typical terrorist organisation... Anyone who thinks it is going to run the government in South Africa is living in cloud-cuckoo land.\" Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher's spokesman, who, when asked if the ANC might overthrow the government of South Africa by force, replied: \"It is cloud-cuckoo land for anyone to believe that could be done\". Ann Widdecombe, British MP used the phrase in a debate on drug prohibition with a representative of Transform Drug Policy Foundation: \"...it is cloud cuckoo land to suggest that [people who don't currently use heroin would not start using it if it became legal]\".\n\nNewt Gingrich referred to Barack Obama's claim that algae could be used as a fuel source as cloud cuckoo land. Henry A. Wallace, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture (later U.S. Vice President in Franklin D. Roosevelt's third term) used the term to describe the unrealistically inflated value of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange just before the crash of 1929 that signaled the onset of the Great Depression. In his 1936 book, \"Whose Constitution? An Inquiry into the General Welfare\", Wallace describes a cartoon in a popular weekly magazine which \"pictured an airplane in an endurance flight refueling in mid-air, and made fun of the old fashioned economist down below who was saying it couldn't be done. The economic aeroplane was to keep on gaining elevation indefinitely, with the millennium just around a cloud\" (p. 75). Wallace wrote that Wall Street's practice of lending money to Europe after World War I \"to pay interest on the [war reparations] debts she owed us and to buy the products we wanted to sell her ... was the international refueling device that for 12 years kept our economic aeroplane above the towering peaks of our credit structure and the massive wall of our tariff, in Cloud-Cuckoo Land\".\n\nPaul Krugman used the phrase referring to inadequate German economic politics toward failing members of the European Union: \"Basically, it seems that even as the euro approaches a critical juncture, senior German officials are living in Wolkenkuckucksheim—cloud-cuckoo land.\" (June 9, 2012). Yuri N. Maltsev, an Austrian economist and economic historian, uses the term to describe the lack of promised results in the communist states in his forward to 1920 essay by Ludwig von Mises: \"Today, the disastrous consequences of enforcing the utopia on the unfortunate populations of the communist states are clear even to their leaders. As Mises predicted, despite the cloud-cuckoo lands of their fancy, roasted pigeons failed to fly into the mouths of the comrades.\"\n\nThe phrase has been used in poetry, music, film and by writers. \"Cloudcuckooland\", a poetry collection by Simon Armitage. \"Cloudcuckooland\", the first album by the Lightning Seeds, released in 1990. In 2002, electronic music producer Sasha released a track called \"Cloud Cuckoo\" on his album Airdrawndagger. Cloud Cuckooland is the name of the eighth world found in the video game \"Banjo-Tooie\". Cloud Cuckoo Land is the name of a magical realm, hidden inside a cloud featured in \"The Lego Movie\". Radiohead uses the term in the lyrics of their song Like Spinning Plates. Publisher and editor Gary Groth uses the term in the title of his review of Scott McCloud's book Reinventing Comics.\n\nCloud Cuckoo Land has been used as a stand-in for Hollywood as in Stella Gibbons's \"Cold Comfort Farm\". Dorothy Sayers, in the Author’s Note to her novel \"Gaudy\" \"Night\" (1936), explains that the story, while set in Oxford, is entirely fictitious, concluding that “...the novelist’s only native country is Cloud-Cuckooland, where they do but jest, poison in jest: no offense in the world.” (The final words are a reference to \"Hamlet\", Act 3, Scene 2.)\n\n“Magical Christmas Land” is a slang term frequently used by players of the collectible card game that appears to be synonymous with Cloud Cuckoo Land.\n"}

The battle was fought on 12 April 1782 off the east coast of Ceylon, near a rocky islet called Providien, south of Trincomalee.\n\nIn 1778, France had entered the American Revolutionary War; and in 1780 Britain declared war on the Dutch Republic after the Dutch refused to stop trading military supplies with France and America. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the Second Anglo-Mysore War in the process.\n\nIn March 1781, French Admiral Bailli de Suffren was dispatched on a mission to provide military assistance to French colonies in India, leading a fleet of five ships, seven transports, and a corvette to escort the transports from Brest. After a happenstance battle with the British fleet at Porto Praya in the Cape Verde Islands in April, the French fleet stopped at the Dutch-controlled Cape of Good Hope in October. Troops were left to assist the Dutch in defence of that colony while the fleet was reinforced by additional ships with command transferred to the elderly Admiral Thomas d'Estienne d'Orves. The French fleet sailed on to Île de France (now Mauritius), arriving at Port Louis in December. They then sailed for India with transports that carried nearly 3,000 men under the command of the Comte du Chemin. D'Orves died in February 1782, shortly before the fleet arrived off the Indian coast, and Suffren resumed command.\n\nSuffren first sailed for Madras, hoping to surprise the British stronghold. When he found the fleet of Sir Edward Hughes anchored there on 15 February 1782, he turned south with the intent of landing troops at Porto Novo, hoping to march up the coast and recapture French and Dutch holdings on the way. Hughes raised anchor and sailed after Suffren. In the Battle of Sadras, both fleets suffered damage without loss of ships, but the French were able to safely land troops at Porto Novo to assist the Mysoreans. Suffren made repairs to his fleet at Pondicherry after that battle; on 23 February, he sailed out to find Hughes, who had gone to Trincomalee for repairs.\n\nOn 8 April, Hughes' fleet was spotted heading for Trincomalee. Suffren gave chase, but was unable to close for three days. Hughes had to change course on 12 April to continue toward Trincomalee, which gave Suffren the advantage of the wind.\n\nThe battle lines engaged at about 12:30 pm. Initially, some of Suffren's captains hesitated, not immediately joining in the line (as had also happened at Sadras), but eventually ten of his twelve ships were engaged against the eleven British ships. \"Monmouth\" was the first ship to quit the British line after being dismasted, and \"Superb\" also suffered significant damage in the early rounds. Hughes was able to regain advantage by ordering his fleet to wear ship, and the battle began to turn against the French. Around 6 pm, a storm arose; the combatants, close to a lee shore, broke off the battle to attend to the risks the storm presented. Darkness from the storm and then nightfall precluded further battle that day.\n\nThe fleets had anchored near enough to each other that Suffren again positioned for battle. Hughes, however, had a convoy to protect, and sailed for Trincomalee. Suffren sailed south and anchored at Batticaloa, which was still under Dutch control, where he spent six weeks for repairs and resupply. While there, he received orders to sail to Île de France (Mauritius) to escort another troop convoy. Suffren chose to disregard this order, as the risk posed by Hughes to French operations required his full strength, and he could not trust his captains. The captains of \"Vengeur\" and \"Artésien\", the two ships that stayed out of the action, were reported for their failure to obey orders, and his second-in-command was intriguing with some of the other captains against him.\n\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\n"}

Along with Stanisław Wigura, he won the international air contest Challenge 1932. \n\nHe was born in Sventiany, near Vilnius in Lithuania (at that time part of the Russian Empire) and attended school in Vilnius. During World War I, he volunteered for the Russian Army, graduated from an officer school in Irkutsk, and served in infantry, fighting against the Germans. He was awarded the Order of St. Anna, 4th class. In 1917 he joined the Polish corps of Gen. Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki, formed in Russia. After the corps was disbanded in 1918, he enlisted in Gen. Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army and fought against the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War. He completed an air observer course then. After the Bolsheviks' victory in the war in 1921, Żwirko fought his way to Poland across the Soviet-Polish border.\n\nIn Poland, he completed an aviation school in Bydgoszcz in November 1923, and a higher pilotage school in Grudziądz. He became a fighter pilot in the 18th Fighter Squadron of the 1st Air Regiment, with a rank of \"porucznik pilot\" (flying lieutenant). He also became active in sports aviation. Żwirko distinguished himself as a very skilled and calm pilot. In August 1927, flying a Breguet 19 military plane, he took the 2nd place in the \"1st air contest of the Little Entente and Poland\" in Yugoslavia, and the 1st place in its rally part. From 1929 he was assigned as a liaison officer in the University Aeroclub (\"Aeroklub Akademicki\") in Warsaw. \n\nThanks to his new post, he could increase his sporting activity, meeting young aviation enthusiasts - mostly students of Warsaw University of Technology. He especially made friends with young engineer Stanislaw Wigura, one of the designers of the RWD team. They often flew together from then, Wigura as a mechanic and second pilot. Between 9 August and 6 September 1929, Żwirko and Wigura flew the RWD-2 prototype across Europe, on Warsaw–Paris–Barcelona–Milano–Warsaw 5000 km route, and on October 6 they won in the 1st Rally of South-Eastern Poland. On October 16, 1929, Żwirko and Antoni Kocjan set an international FAI altitude record of 4,004 m (13,136 ft) in the light tourist plane class (below 280 kg or 616 lb empty weight) on that plane.\nIn July 1930 Żwirko and Wigura took part in the International Tourist Plane Competition Challenge 1930, flying the RWD-4, but they had to withdraw on July 25 due to engine failure, after an emergency landing in Spain. In September and October 1930 they won two contests in Poland (the 2nd Rally of South-Eastern Poland flying RWD-2 and the 3rd Light Aircraft Contest, flying RWD-4), and in October 1931 they won the 4th Touring Planes Contest, flying on a prototype RWD-5. On August 7, 1931, Żwirko and Stanisław Prauss tried to break another altitude record, on RWD-7, climbing at 5,996 m (19,672 ft), but it was not recognized by the FAI due to a non-standard recording device.\n\nIn December 1931 Żwirko was assigned a training escadre commander in an aviation school in Dęblin. In April 1932 he was selected for the Polish team for the International Tourist Plane Competition Challenge 1932, taking place between August 20-August 28, 1932, and he chose Wigura as his crewmate. They won the competition, over favourite German and other teams, flying the new RWD-6, and became heroes in Poland. The success was brought by Żwirko's pilotage skills and high quality of the plane, designed among others, by Wigura.\n\nOn 11 September 1932, flying to an air meeting to Prague, Żwirko and Wigura fatally crashed in their RWD-6 in the forest at Cierlicko near Cieszyn in Czechoslovakia, when the wing broke in a heavy storm. The two men were buried in the Avenue of the Meritorious in Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw.\n\nOn 14 September 1932 the President of Poland posthumously awarded Żwirko the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta \"for his contribution in the field of propaganda in the international aviation\" and, on March 12, 1933, he received a posthumous promotion to the captain with seniority from 1 January 1933.\n\nHe had also been decorated with the Gold and Silver Crosses of Merit and the Russian Order of St. Anna, class IV (combat merit).\n\n"}
{"id": "2163518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163518", "title": "Franklin &amp; Marshall College", "text": "Franklin &amp; Marshall College\n\nFranklin & Marshall College (F&M) is a private residential liberal arts college in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It employs 175 full-time faculty members and has a student body of approximately 2,400 full-time students.\n\nFranklin College was chartered on June 6, 1787, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania on the site of a former brewery. It was named for Benjamin Franklin, who donated £200 to the new institution. Founded by four prominent ministers from the German Reformed Church and the Lutheran Church, in conjunction with numerous Philadelphians, the school was established as a German college whose goal was \"to preserve our present republican system of government,\" and \"to promote those improvements in the arts and sciences which alone render nations respectable, great and happy.\" Its first trustees included five signers of the Declaration of Independence, two members of the Constitutional Convention and seven officers of the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe school's first classes were taught on July 16, 1787, with instruction taking place in both English and German, making it the first bilingual college in the United States.\n\nThe first class consisted of 78 men and 36 women; Franklin was the first college in the United States to accept female students. \"However, the coed policy was soon abandoned. Coeducation was not revived at the College for another 182 years.\"\n\nIn July 1789, Franklin College ran into financial difficulty as its annual tuition of four pounds was not enough to cover operating costs. Enrollment began to dwindle to just a few students and eventually the college existed as nothing more than an annual meeting of the Board of Trustees. In an effort to help the ailing school, an academy was established in 1807. For the next three decades, Franklin College and Franklin Academy managed to limp along financially, with instructors supplementing their income with private tutoring.\n\nHaving grown from a Reformed Church academy, Marshall College opened in 1836 in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania. The school was named for the fourth Chief Justice of the United States John Marshall, who had died the previous year. It was founded with the belief that harmony between knowledge and will was necessary to create a well-rounded person.\n\nDuring its first year, 18 students were taught by Frederick Augustus Rauch and his assistant, Samuel A. Budd. Rauch, an acclaimed young scholar and theologian from Germany who authored the first American textbook in psychology, also served as the college's president.\n\nThe school's small but brilliant faculty grew in both size and status with the addition of John Williamson Nevin and another German scholar, church historian Philip Schaff. Nevin became the college's president upon Rauch's sudden death in 1841.\n\nLife at Marshall College was well-regimented. Students were required to attend morning prayers—sometimes as early as 5 a.m.—and were expected to study in their rooms for six hours a day. In addition, they were forbidden to associate with people of questionable moral character.\n\nMarshall College quickly gained national recognition and attracted students from a large geographical area, with some coming as far away as the West Indies. However, despite being initially well-funded, Marshall College began to experience financial difficulties of its own. By the late 1840s, financial support and enthusiasm among the local community had virtually disappeared and the school was in danger of closing its doors for good.\n\nIn 1835, the school's Debating Society was renamed Diagnothian Literary Society at the suggestion of seminary student Samuel Reed Fisher. That June, Diagnothian was divided into two friendly rivals to encourage debate. Diagnothian retained its original name, while the new society was named Goethean, in honor of German philosopher and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The two organizations sponsored orations and debated politics, philosophy and literature. They merged in 1955, but became separate entities again in 1989. The Diagnothian Society is the oldest student organization on campus.\n\nOn December 6, 1849, Franklin College and Marshall College began to explore the possibility of a merger as a method to secure the future of both institutions. Three years later, on June 7, 1853, the combined college was formally dedicated at Lancaster's Fulton Hall. The merger created an all-male Reformed Church institution that combined the resources of both schools. James Buchanan, four years shy of becoming the 15th President of the United States, was named president of the first Franklin & Marshall board of trustees.\n\nThe college's first two presidents, Emanuel Vogel Gerhart, a Marshall College graduate, and Nevin struggled to keep the young school afloat with an inadequate endowment. The hope of creating a reputable liberal arts institution fueled their efforts to push on. \"No second- or third-rate school will do,\" said Nevin at the formal dedication of the united college. \"We must either have no college at all or else have one that may be in all respects worthy of the name.\"\n\nThe citizens of Lancaster agreed to donate $25,000 towards the construction of a building for the new college. A site on the east end of the city was proposed near where the new Lancaster County Prison was constructed in 1851. Two parallel streets in the area were renamed, one for Franklin and one for Marshall. However, Buchanan ultimately rejected this idea saying \"I do not think the best location for a literary institution should be between a court house and a jail.\" Instead, Buchanan and the board selected a site at the northwestern end of Lancaster. Known locally as \"Gallows Hill,\" it was the former site of Lancaster's public executions and the highest point of ground in city. At the laying of the building's cornerstone in 1853, Henry Harbaugh, a Marshall College graduate and pastor of the Reformed Church of Lancaster noted that the city's lowest point was the prison. Harbaugh stated: \"Thank God! The College stands higher than the jail. Education should be lifted up and let crime sink to the lowest depths!\" The distinctive, tall-towered structure, designed in the Gothic Revival style, was dedicated on May 16, 1856, as \"Recitation Hall.\" Recitation Hall came to be known as \"Old Main\" and the ground as \"College Hill\".\n\nFranklin and Marshall College took as its motto the Latin phrase \"Lux et Lex\", which translates in English to \"Light and Law\". This was the reverse of the Marshall College motto \"Lex et Lux\". While legend has it that the switch was the result of an error by an engraver, it was more likely a deliberate decision to pair the words with its namesakes Benjamin Franklin (\"light\") and John Marshall (\"law\").\n\nThe college seal depicts the profiles of Franklin and Marshall, both looking to the left. It has been often suggested that this represented the two leaders looking westward towards the (then) future expansion of the United States. Despite the fact that his name comes second, John Marshall is shown on the left of the seal and Benjamin Franklin is on the right. But Franklin's full head is shown, while Marshall's profile is cut off and far in the background. Some say that this shows the college's unspoken tendency to favor Franklin's legacy over Marshall's. Recently this preference became more than simply unspoken, as the school actively promoted recognition of Benjamin Franklin's 300th birthday while ignoring John Marshall's 250th birthday, which occurred during consecutive semesters of the 2005-2006 academic year. The school recognized Marshall's milestone birthday only after a petition was circulated by then seniors Ryan Corbalis and Patrick Godfrey and signed by a significant portion of the students and faculty of the college.\n\nOld Main, Goethean Hall, and Diagnothian Hall were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.\n\nIn 1872, the Franklin and Marshall Academy, an all-male prep school, opened on campus. When it closed in 1943, it was the last prep school in America to be directly affiliated with a private college or university. The academy's first building, East Hall, was constructed in 1872. A second and larger building, Hartman Hall, replaced it in 1907. Both buildings were used by the college for various purposes after the academy folded. Hartman Hall was demolished in 1975 and East Hall followed in 1978.\n\n\"College Days\", the first student newspaper, began publication in 1873. Later student newspapers included \"The College Student\" (1881–1914), \"The F&M Weekly\" (1891–1915), \"The Student Weekly\" (1915–1964), \"The Blue and The White\" (1990–1992), and \"The College Reporter\" (1964–present).\n\n\"Oriflamme\", the Franklin and Marshall College yearbook, was established in 1883.\n\nIn 1887, the centennial celebration of Franklin College was held at the school. By then, over 100 students were enrolled at F&M.\n\n1899 saw the formation of the college's first theatre group, the Franklin & Marshall Dramatic Association. The next year, it was renamed the Green Room Club. The club performed plays at Lancaster's Fulton Opera House. Because the college admitted only men, the female roles were played by local actresses. In 1937, the Green Room Theatre opened on campus. F&M alumni who have performed on the Green Room stage include Oscar-winning film director Franklin J. Schaffner and actors Roy Scheider and Treat Williams.\n\nThe college began a rapid period of growth after World War I. Enrollment rose from around 300 students in 1920, to over 750 by 1930. In 1924, the architectural firm of Klauder and Day presented a master campus plan in the Colonial Revival style. Dietz-Santee dormitory, Meyran-Franklin dormitory, the Mayser Physical Education Center, and Hensel Hall were all completed within three years. Two additional dormitories were planned at that time, but never constructed.\n\nThe sesquicentennial celebration of Franklin College was held in mid-October 1937. Student enrollment at that time was 800. A commemorative plaque celebrating the sesquicentennial of Franklin College and the signing of the United States Constitution was presented to the college by the Lancaster County Historical Society.\n\nIn 1939, the school began an aviation program in the new Keiper Liberal Arts Building. The Aeronautical Laboratory eventually became a government-sponsored flight school with 40 faculty members. Two airplanes were disassembled, moved into the building and reassembled on the third floor where they were used as flight simulators.\n\nDuring World War II, Franklin and Marshall College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.\n\nBy 1945, with the majority of young men fighting in World War II, the college population dwindled to just under 500 students and 28 faculty members. The end of the war brought many new students who decided to pursue their education under the G.I. Bill. By 1946, enrollment had swelled to over 1,200 students (including four women permitted to study in the pre-med program), and there was a sudden critical shortage of faculty members.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s brought more college expansion and construction, including North Museum (1953); Marshall-Buchanan Residence Hall (1956), Appel Infirmary (1959), Schnader Residence Hall (1959), Mayser Physical Education Center (1962), Benjamin Franklin Residence Halls (1964), Pfeiffer Science Complex (now Hackman Physical Science Laboratory) (1967), Grundy Observatory (1967), Whitely Psychology Laboratory (1968), and Thomas Residence Hall (1968).\n\nLike other academic institutions in the 1960s, Franklin and Marshall experienced during the decade a series of student protests that were based on important social issues, such as the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War. In April 1961, students rioted in front of the President's house and Hensel Hall, burning effigies and college property in protest of administration policies.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. visited the campus on December 12, 1963 and spoke about civil rights before a capacity audience of 3,300 in Mayser Center, the school's gymnasium.\n\nIn 1965 Robert Mezey, a 30-year-old visiting English instructor and poet, spoke on campus against the Vietnam War, and traveled to Washington, DC to march against the conflict. When someone accused him of urging students to burn their draft cards, he was suspended with pay for a month while the college investigated. The incident caused widespread controversy in the local press, with some residents ordering him to \"get the hell out of Lancaster\" and \"go to Russia.\" Though Mezey was later reinstated, he left the college the following spring. This became known as the \"Mezey Affair.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1969, black students protested the final examination of the history course \"The Black Experience in America.\" Demanding an apology from the faculty for exploitation and an \"A\" in the course, the students argued that no white man can test them on their \"blackness.\" The day before the exam, the professors agreed to the apology, but still insisted that the students take the final exam. On May 22, the day of the exam, 40 black students—many of whom were not enrolled in the course—blocked the entrance to the exam room in Old Main. The professors attempted to hand out the exam to the other students in the class, but the protesters confiscated them. Retreating to Goethean Hall next door, the professors and staff met to evaluate the situation. The protesters followed them to the building, blocked all doors and exits and held them hostage, declaring that they would not release the faculty members until they received an apology and immunity from punishment. The standoff lasted until midnight, when the professors agreed to allow the students to grade themselves. The students relented and released the hostages. However the college's Professional Standards Committee later overturned the decision, declaring that the professors would, in fact, have to grade the students after all.\n\nIn 1969, Franklin and Marshall College ended its formal affiliation with the United Church of Christ, becoming a secular school.\n\nFranklin College enrolled female students during its first few years in the eighteenth century, but it was an academy for teenagers. Franklin and Marshall College was an all-male institution. Women were permitted to attend summer school classes at F&M beginning in 1942. Continuing a trend in single-sex schools across the country, the Board of Trustees announced on January 17, 1969, that it had voted to admit women to F&M, a decision that was supported by male students. In the fall of 1969, 82 freshman women and 34 female transfer students were enrolled in F&M's first coeducational class.\n\nIn 1970, F&M students protested the administration's failure to rehire popular sociology instructor Anthony Lazroe and history instructor Henry Mayer. The protest, known as the \"Lazroe-Mayer incident,\" culminated in the East Hall sit-in on April 30, where students took over the building for several hours.\n\nOn September 17, 1970, the Herman Art Center (named after Jacob Leon Herman, Class of 1916) was dedicated as part of Convocation, during which painter Jim Dine and sculptor Chaim Gross were awarded honorary degrees. The building was designed by Fisher, Nes and Campbell of Baltimore, MD, for the studio art program, but, unfortunately, only half of the original plan was ever constructed due to lack of funds.\n\nIn 1976, the Steinman College Center was constructed. The building—designed by Minoru Yamasaki, architect of New York's World Trade Center—originally housed the campus bookstore. Today it houses the \"College Reporter\", the \"Oriflamme Yearbook\", the College Entertainment Committee, the Phillips Museum of Art, Pandini's (a restaurant), the campus radio station WFNM, and a post office.\n\nOn April 29, 1976, the Green Room Theatre staged the world premiere of the John Updike play \"Buchanan Dying\", about former President James Buchanan, a Lancaster resident and former President of the Board of Trustees. The production was directed by Edward S. Brubaker and starred Peter Vogt, an F&M alumnus. After the premiere, a reception was held at Wheatland, Buchanan's Lancaster residence.\n\nOn March 28, 1979, the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor in nearby Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, experienced a partial meltdown, forcing the college to close for a short time.\n\nThe 1980s were a prosperous time for the college. Construction projects initiated during the decade included Hartman Green (1982); French House (1984); Murray Arts House (1984); Ice Rink (1984); Spaulding Plaza (1985); the Other Room Theatre (1985); major renovations and expansions of Fackenthal Library (1983, renamed Shadek-Fackenthal Library), which currently houses approximately 513,942 volumes; Stahr Hall (1985, renamed Stager Hall, 1988); the Black Cultural Center (1986); and Weis Residence Hall (1989).\n\nOn June 6, 1987, Franklin and Marshall College celebrated its bicentennial.\n\nThe 1990s brought a major expansion to the north side of campus with the construction of College Square in 1991. The multi-use complex houses a new bookstore, laundromat, video store, restaurants and a food court. Other buildings from the decade include International House (1990), Martin Library of the Sciences (1990) (which currently houses approximately 61,170 volumes), and the Alumni Sports and Fitness Center (1995).\n\nAround the start of the 21st century, the college continued to grow with the addition of the Barshinger Center for Musical Arts in Hensel Hall (2000); President's House (built 1933; purchased by the college in 2002); Roschel Performing Arts Center (2003); Writer's House (2004); College Row Apartments (2007) which included apartment style living for upper-classmen with retail space on ground floors; the newly renovated Klehr Center for Jewish life (2008); and a new academic building for Life Sciences and Philosophy, the Ann & Richard Barshinger Life Sciences & Philosophy Building (2007).\n\nIn 2003, the National Park Service created the Franklin and Marshall College Campus Historic District, listing 14 buildings (including Old Main, Goethean Hall, and Diagnothian Hall, previously listed in 1975) and three architectural features.\n\nOn January 19, 2006, the college celebrated the tricentennial of Benjamin Franklin's birth. Among other activities, noted Franklin scholar Walter Issacson gave a lecture, and a full-page ad praising Franklin and advertising the college was purchased in \"The New York Times\".\n\nOn March 10, 2010, it was announced that then current president John Fry would be leaving the college to become the president of Drexel University on August 1, 2010. The college began its search for a new president for the fall semester immediately. Alumnus John Burness took a one-year leave from his job at Duke University as senior vice president for public affairs and government relations to head the college as interim president.\n\nOn November 16, 2010, it was announced that Daniel R. Porterfield would become the new president of the college, effective March 1, 2011. Porterfield came to F&M from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where he served as a senior vice president. He is the 15th president in the college's history.\n\nSince 2011 hundreds of talented, underserved high school students from across the country have taken part in F&M College Prep, a summer immersion program that offers an introduction to all aspects of college life. Each of these participants have gone on to college, and more than 90% have gone on to enroll at four-year colleges, including Harvard, Brown, Stanford, Georgetown, and Bucknell universities, the University of Texas-Austin, Pomona College, Trinity College, Spelman College, and Franklin & Marshall. The Office of Student and Post-Graduate Development—which offers life skills workshops, job-search boot camps for seniors and recent grads, more on-campus recruiting and more programming for alumni—opened in 2012 and enjoys wide support from students and alumni. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded F&M a $700,000 grant for its Faculty Center, which was launched in 2013 to improve support for faculty in their roles as researchers and educators.\n\nOn May 1, 2014 Franklin & Marshall College was named as one of the 55 colleges by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights under review or investigation for their policies or practices for handling sexual assault reports. Prior to the public announcement, President Porterfield sent an email to address the impending OCR \"fact-finding investigation.\"\n\nFranklin College:\n\nMarshall College:\n\nFranklin and Marshall College:\n\nSports have been an active part of Franklin and Marshall since its inception. The college's sports teams are called the Diplomats. Many of the teams compete in the Centennial Conference. Men's intercollegiate competition is in fourteen sports: baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, squash, swimming, tennis, indoor track and field, outdoor track and field, wrestling, and rowing. Women's intercollegiate competition is in fourteen sports: basketball, rowing, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, squash, swimming, tennis, indoor track and field, outdoor track and field, and volleyball. F&M competes in NCAA Division III for all varsity sports except wrestling, which is Division I, and men's and women's squash, which are nondivisional.\n\nThe wrestling program competes for the Rupp Cup against local rival Millersville University.\n\nIn 1866, the student-run Alpha Club sponsored the college's first baseball game.\n\nIn 1887, the first football team was organized by Seminary student Miles O. Noll. Franklin and Marshall College was defeated 9–0 by the York YMCA. Later that year, the program played a re-match and lost again, this time by score of 6–4. Frank Mount Pleasant became the head football coach in 1910.\n\nDistler House, the school's first gymnasium, was constructed in 1891 and contained a bowling alley, indoor running track, and gymnastic equipment.\n\nSponaugle-Williamson Field was constructed in 1895 with the assistance of $1,500 from Henry S. Williamson. It was later renamed \"Williamson Field.\" A concrete grandstand was added in 1922 at a cost of $10,000.\n\nIn 1900 the first basketball game was played. The opposing team was Millersville Normal School.\n\nProfessor Charles W. Mayser founded the F&M wrestling team in 1923, and early 1924 saw the college's first wrestling match as the Blue & White defeated Western Maryland College 24–5. The Diplomat grapplers finished their maiden season with a 4–1 record. F&M wrestling competes in the EIWA and is the only Division III school to compete in Division I wrestling.\n\nMayser Physical Education Center, the college's second gymnasium, was opened in 1927.\n\nIn 1992, F&M became a charter member of the Centennial Conference, an athletic conference of 11 mid-Atlantic institutions that compete in 22 sports in the NCAA's Division III. The other founding members of the conference are Bryn Mawr College, Dickinson College, Gettysburg College, Haverford College, Johns Hopkins University, Muhlenberg College, Swarthmore College, Ursinus College, Western Maryland College, (renamed McDaniel College) and Washington College.\n\nIn 1995, the Alumni Sports and Fitness Center, the school's third gymnasium, opened on the site of the college's former ice rink.\n\nIn 2007, the F&M women's lacrosse team won the NCAA Division III championship with an undefeated season record of 21–0. The women's lacrosse team took back the NCAA Division III championship in 2009, for the second time in three years with a 21–1 record. It marked the third consecutive year that the women's lacrosse team played in the championship game.\n\nThe men's basketball team has reached the NCAA Division III Final Four on five occasions (1979, 1991, 1996, 2000, 2009), appearing in the national championship game in 1991. The men's basketball team has been nationally ranked on a frequent basis since the late 1970s, including No. 1 in Division III at some point during seven different seasons. Head coach Glenn Robinson is the career leader in wins in Division III. Robinson has been listed as one of the top 100 college basketball coaches of all-time.\n\nOther successful athletic teams at F&M include men's soccer, men's and women's swimming, baseball, and squash. They all traditionally compete for conference championships and have been ranked high nationally. In 2008, the men's swimming team won the Centennial Conference championships and the women's swimming team placed second. At that championship, Thomas Anthony Grabiak Jr. of F&M set Centennial Conference championship meet records in the 100 and 200 yd breaststroke events. Men's squash consistently maintains a Top-10 Division I national ranking, having finished No. 8 in the past two seasons. In 1988, the men's lacrosse team finished the season 13-3 and played all the way until the USILA national semifinals.\n\nF&M also boasts several student-run clubs, most notably men's and women's rugby, both of which have become serious contenders for regional, and national championships each season and which compete in the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union. Ultimate frisbee is also a popular club sport on campus, fielding both a men's and a women's team. In 2009, the college water polo team was revived and currently competes in the American Water Polo League and the Collegiate Water Polo League.\n\nSponaugle–Williamson Field is a stadium for the outdoor athletic teams of the college. It was built in 1920 as Williamson Field, named after S. Woodrow Sponaugle, who coached football and basketball and was the athletic director at F&M for 15 years. He shares the stadium's dedication with Henry S. Williamson, who was a trustee of the college from 1894 to 1917.\n\nShadek Stadium is used for football and lacrosse. Construction began in the fall of 2016 and ended in the fall of 2017. The stadium was named after the Shadeck family, a family prominent at the school. The turf field in the stadium, Gilburg Field, is named after football player and former F&M coach Tom Gilburg. In the first football game played in the stadium, the Diplomats defeated Centennial Conference rivals Dickinson College 56-0.\n\nChi Phi, founded on December 1, 1854, remains the only fraternity at F&M with a fraternity house actually on the campus grounds. In 1929, through a special lease agreement with the college, the chapter built its house at 603 Race Avenue. The house was dedicated and opened in 1929, during the chapter's 75th anniversary celebration. During World War II, with school and fraternity attendance down, the house was converted to a temporary infirmary. In 1998, due to a series of disagreements with the college, the lease was terminated and the fraternity was evicted. On February 7, 2001, after three years, Chi Phi renegotiated a new lease with F&M. They reoccupied the house the following August.\n\nIn 1978, the school's first sorority, Sigma Sigma Sigma, was chartered. In 2005, the chapter became inactive.\n\nIn April 1988, the College's Board of Trustees voted to no longer officially recognize the school's fraternities and sororities. This was known as \"derecognition.\" At the time, three of the school's fraternities had recently lost their national charters due to various offenses. In an effort to repair the system, the college administration proposed eight specific reforms to the Greek Council, which were ultimately rejected by all of the organizations. The result was derecognition. This was highly unpopular with the student body, but it served to remove the college from any liability associated with hazing and underage alcohol abuse, issues that were in the national public eye at that time. The Greek system continued, albeit without financial or administrative support from the college. After several years, a small number of fraternities struggled with health code violations, fires, and one accidental alcohol-related death. Owing to several factors, including dwindling financial support from fraternity and sorority alumni and legitimate concerns about student academics, health and safety, the college announced on May 19, 2004, that it would reinstate a new, revised Greek system beginning on September 1, 2004, after a 16-year absence.\n\nAs part of the new agreement between the school's Greek organizations and the administration, fraternity and sorority houses are required to submit to weekly \"life safety\" inspections by school officials, and inspections by the local fire department, police department, and office of public health conducted once per semester. An Inter-Fraternity Council consisting of representatives from all fraternities and advised by a member of the faculty, as well as a Greek Council consisting of members of all Greek organizations (male and female), similarly advised by a faculty member, were re-established to deal with issues facing the Greek community and advising the administration on Greek issues.\n\nAs recently as the fall of 2008, relations between the administration and the Greek system were strained. The administration placed a month-long moratorium on all Greek social events. During this period, the Interfraternity Council revised protocols governing parties, and the revisions were approved by the administration resulting in the lifting of the moratorium, but the administration committed to more sternly enforcing the newly agreed-upon rules. There were also tensions between some members of the Greek system and Lancaster City, arising chiefly from incidents of crime.\n\nConcerns over the condition of Greek housing has led the administration and Greek organizations to examine different possibilities for improving the quality of housing options in order for such houses to receive continued support and approval from the college. In some cases, the result has been the temporary closure of Greek housing until the buildings can be brought up to school and town safety standards.\n\nGreek life is a major part of F&M's community. As of the spring of 2014, 43.7% of the F&M student body are members of the Greek Community.\n\n\n\n\nNotable alumni of Franklin & Marshall College include Edwin R. Keedy, Dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School (class of 1899), Albert Clay, appointed as the first William M. Laffan Professor of Assyriology and Babylonian Literature at Yale University in 1910, Nobel Prize-nominated medical researcher Theodore E. Woodward (class of 1934), Academy Award-winning film director Franklin Schaffner (1942), White House Chief of Staff under Ronald Reagan Kenneth Duberstein (1965), Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn (1948), Academy Award-nominated actor Roy Scheider (1955), House Majority Whip William H. Gray (1963),and Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning playwright James Lapine (1971). United States Army Major Richard Winters, a notable commander of the 506th who parachuted into Normandy.\n\nIn 1999, a company based in Verona, Italy began producing items of clothing in a vintage 1950s collegiate-style with the words \"Franklin and Marshall\" on them. F&M alumni began to report seeing F&M merchandise for sale in Europe, which puzzled the college.\n\nIn 2001, Tim McGraw posed for publicity photos wearing a \"Franklin Marshall Wrestling\" T-shirt, one of which was included in the CD booklet for his album \"Set This Circus Down\". When many asked Franklin & Marshall College about its nonexistent connection to the singer, the college investigated and discovered that the Franklin Marshall Clothing company was using its name without permission. In 2003, the college licensed the name to the company so it could sell its products, many of which omit Franklin & Marshall's ampersand, in the United States.\n\nThe clothing company has stated in news reports that its designs are \"inspired by the American Vintage College spirit, as exemplified by Franklin & Marshall College.\" Most of its products are made in Italy and are much more expensive than the Champion-produced licensed apparel sold by the college's bookstore. the company has stores in six cities: Athens, Dubai, Milan, Tokyo, and Paris, and also sells through high-end stores like Harrods in Britain. Although it no longer sells its products in the United States due to poor sales, in 2010 the company pledged to donate $130,000 to the college's scholarship fund.\n\nIn 2013 Franklin & Marshall became a sponsor of Hellas Verona, a football (soccer) team in the Italian Serie A.\n\n"}

The battle was fought on 6 July 1782. The battle was indecisive but Suffren was stopped in his goal by Hughes and withdrew to Cuddalore, while the British remained in control of Negapatam.\n\nFrance had entered the American Revolutionary War in 1778, and Britain declared war on the Dutch Republic in late 1780, after the Dutch refused to stop trading in military supplies with the French and the Americans. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the Second Anglo-Mysore War in the process. Negapatam was sieged and taken by Sir Hector Munro in November 1781.\n\nThe French admiral the Bailli de Suffren was dispatched on a mission to provide military assistance to French colonies in India. He arrived in February 1782, and immediately engaged the British fleet of Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Hughes in the inconclusive Battle of Sadras. After both fleets spent time in port repairing, refitting, and re-provisioning, they met again in the April Battle of Providien, south of the Ceylonese port of Trincomalee, that was ended by a storm and then nightfall. Hughes put into Trincomalee, a formerly Dutch port the British had captured in January, for repairs, while Suffren went to the Dutch-controlled port of Batticaloa.\n\nWhile at Batticaloa, Suffren received dispatches from the Île de France (now Mauritius) that ordered him to return there to escort additional French troops to India. He chose not to do so, citing the parity between the two fleets, and the need to defend French troops already on the ground in India against the movements of the British fleet.\n\nThe French, with about 2,000 effective troops under the command of Comte du Chemin, had captured Cuddalore on 6 May. Hyder Ali, the ruler of Mysore, originally wanted the French to take the more important port of Negapatam. The French joined with Hyder's army of 60,000 to lay siege to the British at Vandavasi. When the British sent an army of 12,000 toward Vandavasi to relieve the siege, du Chemin, against the wishes of Hyder, refused to engage in a battle that the Franco-Mysorean force would probably have won (which would have significantly reduced the British military presence in India). As a result, Hyder lifted the siege and retreated to the vicinity of Pondicherry.\n\nHyder Ali learned of Suffren's actions in the first two battles with Hughes, and sent a message to Suffren to arrange a meeting. Suffren had in the meantime sailed from Batticaloa to do the job that du Chemin would not: capture Negapatam. He stopped at Cuddalore on 20 June to take on troops and supplies for the attack, which he hoped to do by surprise. When he was ready to sail he learned that Hughes had sailed past, apparently also en route to Negapatam. As his fleet had grown by captured prizes and arrivals from Île de France (it was now twelve ships of the line and four frigates), Suffren gave chase and caught up with Hughes, who had anchored off Negapatam, on 5 July.\n\nSuffren was in the process of forming his battle line around 3 pm when a squall took down the main and mizzen top masts of \"Ajax\", under Bouvet-Précourt, forcing her to drop out of his line. When the squall calmed, the breeze was to Hughes' advantage so he sailed from his anchorage at the harbour of Negapatam. The two fleets spent the night anchored two cannonshots apart.\n\nThe next morning, Suffren was infuriated to learn that repairs had not been made to \"Ajax\", and that her captain wanted to retreat. Given that battle was imminent, Suffren refused. He then ordered his line to bear down on the British line for close action. As they began to move, \"Ajax\" stood away and did not join the action. At 9:30 am on 6 July, the fleets opened fire on each other, first at long range. \"Flamand\" engaged \"Hero\" and \"Exeter\", \"Annibal\" engaged \"Isis\", \"Sévère\" faced \"Burford\", and \"Brillant\" opposed \"Sultan\" while the two flagships, \"Héros\" and \"Superb\", did battle with each other. The remainder of the British line was not able to directly line up against the French, resulting in an angle in their line where \"Sphinx\" and \"Monarca\" battled that minimized the action between the ships at the end of the line. \"Flamand\" took significant damage, but was able to return the favour to its opponents. \"Brillant\" began to suffer under the fire of \"Sultan\", but Suffren managed to detach from \"Héros\" to come to her rescue.\n\nThe battle proceeded with vigour until about 1 pm, when the wind suddenly changed, throwing both lines into confusion. With the wind head-on to the two parallel lines of ships, some ships turned to starboard and some to port. The majority turned away from the engagement but six ships, four British and two French, turned in towards one another. The four British ships were the fourth, fifth, eighth and tenth in line, respectively \"Burford\", \"Sultan\", \"Worcester\" and \"Eagle\"; the two French were \"Sévère\" (third in line) and towards the rear of the line \"Brillant\", which was dismasted by this stage. \"Sévère\" was engaged by \"Sultan\" and \"two other ships\", and escaped through the arrival of Suffren in his flagship and the filling of her sails as she fell off to starboard, while \"Brillant\" was fired on by \"Worcester\" and \"Eagle\", and was also rescued by the approach of Suffren's ship, though not before the loss of over a third of her complement dead or wounded.\n\nWith occasional meetings between two ships, Hughes attempted to reform his line around 2 pm, but neither fleet was in a state to adopt battle positions easily, so Suffren decided to draw away downwind, to the north, toward Cuddalore. One British observer noted that \"our fleet was utterly incapable of preventing or pursuing them\".\n\nSuffren had been thwarted in his efforts to take to Negapatam – he stripped M. Bouvet, the captain of \"Ajax\", of his command, and arrested three others for a variety of transgressions in this battle and the previous two. One of those arrested, M. de Cillart, commander of \"Sévère\", had started to strike his colors during one of the post-squall engagements, but his subordinates prevented the act. Suffren then sailed for Cuddalore to effect repairs. Hughes spent the next two weeks at sea, only returning to Madras for repairs on 20 July. Negapatam would remain in British hands until the end of the war. At the Treaty of Paris (1783) the Dutch Republic would cede Negapatam to Britain.\n\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\n"}

{"id": "2163533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163533", "title": "History of the Iranian Air Force", "text": "History of the Iranian Air Force\n\nThe history of the Iranian Air Force can be divided into two phases—before the Islamic Revolution, and after it.\n\nThe Imperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF) was a branch of the Imperial Iranian Armed Forces and was established by Reza Shah, the Shah of Iran, in 1920. It became operational with its first fully trained pilots on February 25, 1925. Iran's first attempt to procure aircraft from the United States in the 1920s failed due to Washington's refusal to supply equipment because of a World War I treaty. Until World War II, the IIAF's aircraft inventory consisted entirely of European aircraft, mainly British and German. However, following a co-ordinated British and Soviet invasion of Iran during World War II in retaliation for Reza Shah's declaration of neutrality, the IIAF's bases were occupied by the Allies and all existing IIAF aircraft were either destroyed or dismantled by the invading Soviets and British. A few Iranian planes did manage to get airborne during the invasion and engaged the Royal Air Force in unsuccessful dogfights.\n\nA roughly 1946 order of battle for the Air Force can be found in \"Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War II.\" Two regiments were both reported to be based near Tehran. After World War II, the IIAF began to slowly rebuild its inventory, with aircraft mainly supplied by the United States and Great Britain. A national, aerobatic display team was formed in 1958. Called \"Golden Crown\", and a part of the IIAF, this lasted until 1978. Lieutenant General Nader Jahanbani is credited to establish the Golden Crown and generally considered as the \"Father of IIAF\". In the 1960s, the IIAF acquired 90 Canadair Sabre fighters from the RCAF, but they were flipped over to the Pakistan Air Force.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the air force was used as part of a joint, aerial espionage programme of Iran and the United States, against the former-Soviet Union. This was in two parts, known as Project Dark Gene and Project Ibex.\n\nThe IIAF deployed aircraft to Oman in the 1970s, when Iran provided military assistance to that country, during the Dhofar rebellion. During this conflict, one Iranian F-4 Phantom II was shot down by rebels.\n\nIn 1976, the Imperial Iranian Air Force responded to a UFO incident over the Iranian capital, Tehran.\n\nLater in the 1970s, the IIAF became the only military force other than the United States Navy to be equipped with the F-14 Tomcat. Consequently, it also became the only other operator of the AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missile. After the 1979 Iranian revolution, some of these planes were not in working order due to a lack of necessary spare parts, because of an American arms embargo and damage sustained on the aircraft during the Iraqi invasion (Iran–Iraq War). Some were brought back into service, due to localised production of reverse-engineered, Iranian-made, spare parts, as well as \"cannibalism\" (the process of taking working parts from damaged aircraft and using them to repair others).\n\nDuring this era, the United States instituted the \"Spellout\", \"Peace Ruby\" and \"Peace Net\" programmes to improve/upgrade, the air-defence system of Iran. As well as air defence radars, the network was linked using microwave LOS and troposcatter communications networks.\n\nThe IIAF had also placed an order for over 150 F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter aircraft in 1976, but deliveries were never made, due to the overthrow of the Shah by Ayatollah Khomeni in the revolution. These aircraft would go on to serve in the Israeli Air Force.\n\nThe overthrow of the Shah in the Islamic Revolution of February 1979, was followed by changes to the organization of the Iranian military. The air force was renamed the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF), and largely inherited the equipment and structure of the former IIAF. Due to strained relations with the west, Iran had to procure new equipment from Brazil, the Soviet Union/Russia and the People's Republic of China.\n\nHowever, it lost most of its leading officers in the course of post-revolutionary chaos, as well as due to the prosecution of those considered as loyal to the Shah, pro-U.S. or elsewhere by the new government in Tehran. Its other personnel were also decimated by the purges, with many pilots removed or leaving the air force. This left the air force ill-prepared for the Iran–Iraq War.\n\nA series of purges and forced retirements, as a consequence of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, resulted in the manpower of the service being halved between February 1979 and July 1980, leaving the IRIAF ill-prepared for the Iran–Iraq War (also called the \"1st Persian Gulf War\"). The sudden Iraqi air strikes against six Iranian airfields and four other military installations, launched on the afternoon of 22 September 1980, came as a complete surprise and caused a shock in the renamed \"IRIAF\", which was in the midst of reorganizing following the Iranian revolution which had ended 1 year earlier. Nevertheless, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force retaliated, flying strikes involving up to 146 fighter-bombers against Iraqi airfields, oil industry installations, and communications sites. In addition to striking Iraqi airfields, the IRIAF succeeded in damaging Iraqi oil-producing and exporting facilities; resulting in Baghdad's decision to stop all oil exports for several years.\n\nFollowing a one-week-long counter-air campaign, and due to a critical situation on the ground in Khuzestan Province, the IRIAF was thrown into the land-battle, mainly in the areas of Khorramshahr, Ahvaz, and Dezful. Here, the IRIAF's performance surprised most informed observers, with air strikes against armour and supply columns. Due to heavy losses in troops and armour, Iranian air superiority and an interruption of supply systems, the Iraqis had to stop their offensive, and then became involved in extremely bitter land-battles against Iranian ground forces.\n\nHowever, the IRIAF paid a heavy price for this success, losing dozens of its best pilots and aircraft in the period between September and December 1980. Although the readiness rates of the IRIAF significantly increased in the following months, its overall role and influence declined, as the clerical government searched to put the emphasis in fighting on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) militias, but also attempted to develop a separate air arm for this service.\n\nAfter the successful liberation of most Iranian areas captured by the Iraqis, in late spring 1982, the situation of the IRIAF changed completely. From an air arm that was offensive by nature, it was largely relegated to air defense and, relatively seldom, tasks of flying bombing attacks against targets of industrial and military significance inside Iraq. Simultaneously, the IRIAF had to learn to maintain and keep operational its large fleet of U.S.-built aircraft and helicopters without outside help, due to American sanctions. Reaching back on equipment purchased from the U.S.A. in the 1970s, the Iranians began establishing their own aerospace industry; their efforts in this remained largely unrecognized until recently.\n\nHowever, the IRIAF was able to obtain limited amounts of spare parts and weapons for its American-made aircraft, when Iran was able to buy American spare parts and weapons for its armed forces, during the Iran–Contra affair. Deliveries came via Israel and later, from the USA.\n\nFrom 1984 and 1985, the IRIAF found itself confronted by an ever-better organized and equipped opponent, as the Iraqi Air force—reinforced by deliveries of advanced fighter-bombers from France and the Soviet Union—launched numerous offensives against Iranian population centres, industrial infrastructures, powerplants, and oil-export hubs. These became better known as \"The Tanker War\" and \"The War of the Cities\". To defend against an increasing number of Iraqi air strikes, the IRIAF leaned heavily on its large fleet of Grumman F-14 Tomcat air superiority fighters. Tomcats were mainly deployed in defense of the strategically important Kharg Island (main hub for Iranian oil exports), and Tehran. Over 300 air-to-air engagements against IQAF fighters, fighter-bombers, and bombers, were fought in these areas alone between 1980 and 1988.\n\nConfronted with the fact that it could not obtain replacements for equipment lost in what became a war of attrition against Iraq, for the rest of the conflict, the IRIAF remained defence-orientated, conserving its surviving assets as a \"force in being\". From mid 1987, the IRIAF found itself confronted also with U.S. Navy fighters over the Persian Gulf. A number of confrontations that occurred between July 1987 and August 1988, stretched available IRIAF assets to the limit, exhausting its capability to defend Iranian air space against Iraqi air strikes.\n\nImmediately after the end of the Iran–Iraq War, the IRIAF was partially re-built by limited purchases of MiG-29 fighters and Su-24 bombers from the Soviet Union, as well as F-7M and FT-7 fighters from China. While a welcome reinforcement, these types never replaced the older, U.S.-built F-4 Phantoms or F-14 Tomcats (now the only air arm in the world to continue using the fighter), or even Northrop F-5 Tiger IIs. Instead, the IRIAF continued efforts to maintain these types in service, and began a number of projects with the intention to refurbish and upgrade them.\n\nA Russian attempt to sell a large number of MiG-27s, MiG-31s, and Tupolev Tu-22Ms to Iran, launched in 1993, was spoiled by a lack of interest and money on the part of Iran.\n\nFollowing an alleged agreement (no proof exists for it) between the regimes in Baghdad and Tehran, in February 1991 a significant number of Iraqi Air Force (IrAF) aircraft were evacuated to Iranian airfields, to avoid destruction in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The agreement was for Iran to return them after the war, but the Iranians impounded these aircraft instead, claiming them as war reparations for the Iran–Iraq War.\n\nThe IRIAF has pressed into service all of the 36 Su-24MKs, 7 SU-25s and 24 Mirage F.1BQs and F.1EQs flown from Iraq, while all the other types—including 40 Su-20/22s and at least ten MiG-23s of various versions—were stored.\n\nThe exact current composition of the IRIAF is hard to determine, but estimates do exist. Many aircraft belonging to the Iraqi Air Force took refuge in Iran during the Persian Gulf War in 1991, and many were put into service with the IRIAF or taken apart for spare parts.\n\nDue to the continuous spare parts shortages faced by the air force, a decision was made in the late 1980s to develop a local aerospace industry to support the air force.\n\nIn 2002, Iran with the co-operation of Ukraine, successfully started the manufacture of the Iran-140; a licence-built version of the Antonov An-140 transport aircraft. Simultaneously, Iran began construction of two 100% domestically produced fighters, upgraded using technology from the F-14 Tomcat and the F-5 Tiger II. The fighters have been named the Azarakhsh and the Shafaq.\n\nSince then the country has also become self-sufficient in the manufacture of helicopters. The country claims that it is capable of producing the old U.S. AH-1 Cobra gunship. Additionally, Iran also produces Bell Helicopter Bell 212 and Bell 206 helicopters in serial production. These are known respectively as the Shabaviz 2-75 and the Shabaviz 206.\n\nUnlike many other nations with modern air forces, Iran was engaged in an intense and protracted war. The 8 year long conflict with Iraq gave the IRIAF the opportunity to develop some battle-tested and hardened fighter pilots. Though information about the IRIAF is, at best, hard to access, two men stand out as the best Iranian fighter aces.\n\nJalil Zandi is Iran's most successful fighter pilot. Flying the American made F-14 Tomcat he claimed 11 aerial victories, with 8 of those being confirmed by western sources. These include 4 MiG-23s, 2 Su-22s, 2 MiG 21 and 3 Mirage F1s. These totals make him the most successful Iranian fighter pilot, the most successful F-14 Tomcat pilot, and the most recent (and last man) to claim ace status.\n\nYadollah Javadpour flew the F-5 Freedom Fighter, another American made jet, and claimed five Iraqi aircraft shot down; two being reliably confirmed. This makes him an ace and the most successful F-5 fighter pilot, but his greatest claim to fame happened on August 6, 1983 when he shot down an Iraqi MiG-25. This was a significant achievement for an F-5 pilot, as the MiG-25 is a much bigger and faster aircraft with a substantial altitude advantage. His other confirmed kill was an Su-20 on October 17, 1980.\n\n"}

The regiment saw service in the Second Boer War, the First World War, the Second World War, and the Korean War.\n\nIn 1968 the Royal Ulster Rifles was amalgamated with the other regiments of the North Irish Brigade, the Royal Irish Fusiliers (Princess Victoria's), and the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers to create the Royal Irish Rangers.\n\nThe regiment's history dates backs to the reign of King George III. In 1793 the British Army expanded to meet the commitments of the war with the French First Republic. As part of that expansion it raised two new regiments of foot, the 83rd and the 86th. In 1881, under the Childers Reforms, the 83rd and 86th were amalgamated into a single regiment, named the Royal Irish Rifles, one of eight infantry regiments raised and garrisoned in Ireland. It was the county regiment of Antrim, Down, Belfast and Louth, with its depot located at Victoria Barracks, Belfast. Militarily, the whole of Ireland was administered as a single command within the United Kingdom with Command Headquarters at Parkgate (Phoenix Park) Dublin, directly under the War Office in London.\n\nThe regiment suffered serious losses at the Battle of Stormberg in December 1899 during the Second Boer War. In October 1905, a memorial was erected in the grounds of Belfast City Hall in memory of the 132 who did not return. Field Marshal Lord Grenfell unveiled the memorial while the Times reported the event.\n\nIn 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had three Reserve but no Territorial battalions.\n\nThe 1st Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 25th Brigade in the 8th Division in November 1914 for service on the Western Front. It saw action at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915, the Battle of Fromelles in July 1915 and the Battle of Loos in September 1915 before taking part in the Battle of the Somme in September 1916. \n\nThe 2nd Battalion landed at Rouen as part of the 7th Brigade in the 3rd Division in August 1914 and in the remainder of that year saw action at the Battle of Mons, Battle of Le Cateau, First Battle of the Marne, First Battle of the Aisne, Battle of La Bassée and the Battle of Messines. By September 1914, only 6 officers and 200 men of the Battalion's original 1,100 men were still in active service. By October the battalion had been further reduced to two officers and 46 men and by the end of 1914, 97 per cent of the original battalion had been killed, injured or taken prisoner.\n\nThe 6th (Service) Battalion landed at Anzac Cove as part of the 29th Brigade in the 10th (Irish) Division in August 1915 but moved to Salonika in October 1915 and to Egypt for service in Palestine in September 1917. The 7th (Service) Battalion, which absorbed a company of the Royal Jersey Militia, landed at Le Havre as part of the 48th Brigade in the 16th (Irish) Division in December 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 8th (Service) Battalion (East Belfast), 9th (Service) Battalion (West Belfast) and 10th (Service) Battalion (South Belfast) landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 107th Brigade in the 36th (Ulster) Division in October 1915 for service on the Western Front.\n\nThe 11th (Service) Battalion (South Antrim), 12th (Service) Battalion (Central Antrim) and 13th (Service) Battalion (1st County Down) landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 108th Brigade in the 36th (Ulster) Division in October 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 14th (Service) Battalion (Young Citizens) landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 109th Brigade in the 36th (Ulster) Division in October 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 15th (Service) Battalion (North Belfast) landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 107th Brigade in the 36th (Ulster) Division in October 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 16th (Service) Battalion (2nd County Down) (Pioneers) landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as pioneer battalion for the 36th (Ulster) Division in October 1915 for service on the Western Front.\n\nSome 7,010 soldiers from the regiment were killed in action during the First World War.\n\nAfter the First World War the War Office decided that Ulster should be represented on the Army List as Connaught, Leinster and Munster already had their own regiments and so, in 1920, a new name was proposed for the Royal Irish Rifles. From 1 January 1921 the regiment became the Royal Ulster Rifles. The regiment moved to St Patrick's Barracks in 1937. In 1937 the already close relationship with the London Irish Rifles was formally recognised when they were incorporated into the Corps while still retaining their regimental identity as a territorial battalion. Two years later the London Irish formed a second battalion.\n\nWhen war was declared the 1st Battalion was serving in India, with the 31st Independent Brigade Group, which was trained in mountain warfare. When the brigade returned to the United Kingdom, it was decided that, with its light scale of equipment, the brigade could be converted into a glider-borne unit. 31st Infantry Brigade, which also included the 1st Border Regiment, 2nd South Staffs and 2nd Ox and Bucks, was renamed 1st Airlanding Brigade and trained as glider infantry. They were assigned to the 1st Airborne Division, part of the British Army's airborne forces. The battalion, along with the 2nd Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry, were later transferred to join the 12th Devonshire Regiment in the 6th Airlanding Brigade as part of the newly raised 6th Airborne Division which was actually only the second of two airborne divisions created by the British Army in World War II.\n\nCarried in Horsa gliders, the battalion took part in Operation Mallard, the British glider-borne landings in the later afternoon of 6 June 1944, otherwise known as D-Day. They served throughout the Battle of Normandy employed as normal infantry until August 1944 and the breakout from the Normandy beachhead where the entire 6th Airborne Division advanced 45 miles in 9 days. They returned to England in September 1944 for rest and retraining until December 1944 when the 6th Airborne was then recalled to Belgium after the surprise German offensive in the Ardennes which is now known as the Battle of the Bulge where the division played a comparatively small role in the mainly-American battle. They then took part in their final airborne mission of the war known as Operation Varsity, which was the airborne element of Operation Plunder, the crossing of the River Rhine by the 21st Army Group in March 1945. The 6th Airborne was joined by the U.S. 17th Airborne Division, and both divisions suffered heavy casualties.\n\nThe 2nd Battalion was part of the 9th Infantry Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division serving with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France from 1939-1940. The division was commanded by the then Major General Bernard Montgomery who would eventually lead the Anglo-Canadian forces as commander of the 21st Army Group in the North West Europe Campaign. The 3rd Infantry Division took part in the Battle of Dunkirk, where it gained a decent reputation and earned the nickname of \"Monty's Ironsides\", and had to be evacuated from Dunkirk with the rest of the BEF. The battalion returned to Europe for the D-Day landings in June 1944 and fought in the Battle of Normandy, specifically in Operation Charnwood where they were the first British troops to enter the city of Caen, which had previously seen bitter fighting in the British attempt to capture it.\n\nThe 6th (Home Defence) Battalion was raised in 1939 from No. 200 Group National Defence Companies and consisting of older men with previous military experience who were unfit for active service. On 24 December 1940 the battalion was redesignated as the 30th Battalion, dropping the Home Defence from its title, and converted to a regular infantry battalion. It was disbanded in Northern Ireland in May 1943. The 7th (Home Defence) Battalion was raised on 29 June 1940, joining the 215th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home). The battalion served in Ulster until leaving for Great Britain in September 1942. On 24 December 1941, the battalion was redesignated the 31st Battalion and dropped the Home Defence title.\n\nThe 8th Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles was also raised in 1940, and joined 203rd Independent Infantry Brigade (Home). In early 1942 the battalion was transferred to the Royal Artillery and converted into the 117th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery. The regiment served with Home Forces until November 1942 when it was sent overseas to North Africa to fight in the final stages of the North African Campaign as part of the British First Army. In September 1943 the regiment landed in Italy shortly after the initial invasion, now as part of the British Eighth Army, and served on the Italian Front until June 1944, when the regiment was broken up and the men were retrained as infantrymen, due to a severe shortage of infantrymen, particularly in Italy. Many of the men retrained were sent to the 2nd, 7th and 10th battalions of the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own), another rifle regiment, in 61st Lorried Infantry Brigade, part of 6th Armoured Division.\n\nThe 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion was formed on 12 September 1940 at Holywood from the younger soldiers of the 6th and 7th battalions and volunteers of the ages of 18 and 19 who were too young for conscription. The battalion spent most of its time guarding airfields and aerodromes before moving to Great Britain in October 1941.\n\nIn 1947 the Royal Ulster Rifles were grouped with the other two remaining Irish regiments, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the Royal Irish Fusiliers, into the North Irish Brigade. In 1948, the 2nd Battalion was amalgamated with the 1st Battalion to form the 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles (83rd and 86th), thus retaining the history of both of the previous regiments of foot.\n\nThe 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles disembarked at Pusan in early November 1950 as part of the 29th Independent Infantry Brigade Group for service in the Korean War. They were transported forward to Uijeongbu, where under the direct command of the Eighth United States Army they were directed against guerrilla forces swept past by the rapid progress of the United Nations Army. By mid December 1950 a defensive line was being prepared on the south bank of the River Han on the border with North Korea protecting the approach to Seoul, the capital of South Korea. As the New Year started, the Fiftieth Chinese Communist Army engaged the United Nations troops focusing on 29 Brigade, who were dispersed over a very wide front (12 miles). The Royal Ulster Rifles fighting with 1st Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers were able to hold their position in their first major action at the Battle of Chaegunghyon and the Communist Army's progress was halted, at least temporarily.\n\nThe Battle of the Imjin River began on 22 April 1951 with the goal of taking Seoul. By 25 April 1951, the Brigade was ordered to withdraw as the Communist forces were threatening to encircle it. With virtually no cover and seriously outnumbered, the Royal Ulster Rifles came under heavy fire as they withdrew to a blocking position. The Brigade was able to hold its position, despite fierce fighting, and neutralized the effectiveness of the Sixty-fourth Chinese Communist Army. Although the enemy's offensive had come within 5 miles of Seoul, the capital had been saved. At the time, the Times reported the Battle of Imjin River concluding with: \"The fighting 5th wearing St George and the Dragon and the Irish Giants with the Harp and Crown have histories that they would exchange with no one. As pride, sobered by mourning for fallen observes how well these young men have acquitted themselves in remotest Asia. The parts taken by the regiments may be seen as a whole. The motto of the Royal Ulster Rifles may have the last word Quis Separabit\" (who shall separate us).\n\nAs a result of this action, members of the Royal Ulster Rifles were awarded two Distinguished Service Orders, two Military Crosses, two Military Medals, and three men were Mentioned in Despatches. When the area was recaptured, a memorial was erected to the 208 men killed or missing after the battle. It stood over-looking the battlefield until 1962 when Seoul's growth threatened to consume it, and it was carried by HMS \"Belfast\" back to Ireland where it was the focus of St Patrick's Barracks in Ballymena. When the barracks closed in 2008, the Imjin River Memorial was again moved, this time to the grounds of the Belfast City Hall.\n\nThe Regiment continued to accept recruits from the rest of Ireland; for example, almost 50% of personnel in the 1st Battalion who arrived in Korea in 1950 were Irish nationals. In July 1968 the Royal Ulster Rifles amalgamated with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the Royal Irish Fusiliers to form the Royal Irish Rangers (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd and 87th).\n\nThe Royal Ulster Rifles Museum is located in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast. The museum's artefacts include uniforms, badges, medals, regimental memorabilia, trophies, paintings and photographs.\n\nRecipients of the Victoria Cross:\n\n\nThe regiment's battle honours were as follows:\n\nColonels of the Regiment were:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2163536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163536", "title": "Battle of Trincomalee", "text": "Battle of Trincomalee\n\nThe Battle of Trincomalee was fought between a British fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Hughes and a French fleet under the Bailli de Suffren off the coast of Trincomalee, then Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka), on 3 September 1782. It was the fourth in a series of battles fought between the two fleets off the coast of the Indian subcontinent during the Anglo-French War.\n\nFrance had entered the American Revolutionary War in 1778, and Britain declared war on the Dutch Republic in late 1770 after the Dutch refused to stop trading in military supplies with the French and the Americans. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the Second Anglo-Mysore War in the process.\n\nThe French admiral the Bailli de Suffren was dispatched on a mission to provide military assistance to French colonies in India. He arrived in February 1782, and immediately engaged the British fleet of Vice-Admiral Hughes in the inconclusive Battle of Sadras. After both fleets spent time in port repairing, refitting, and revictualing, they met again in the April Battle of Providien, south of the Ceylonese port of Trincomalee, which was ended by a storm and then nightfall. Hughes put into Trincomalee, a formerly Dutch port the British had captured in January, for repairs, while Suffren went to the Dutch-controlled port of Batticaloa. Suffren and Hughes then met a third time off Negapatam, again with inconclusive results, after which Suffren anchored off Cuddalore to make repairs.\n\nDue to the exposed nature of the anchorage at Cuddalore, and the impending arrival of additional British fleets, Suffren decided to attempt the capture of Trincomalee to gain a safe harbour for his fleet where he might effect more substantial repairs to his fleet. (He had already cannibalized prize ships and transports, as well as housing in Cuddalore, to make repairs.) Suffren was meeting with Hyder Ali near Cuddalore on 28 July when \"Lézard\" brought news of the arrival of a French fleet near the southern end of Ceylon. This fleet included two ships of the line, a frigate, and transports carrying 800 troops and their supplies. He immediately sailed for Batticaloa. On 21 August 1782, \"Ilustre\" and \"Saint-Michel\" arrived there, making their junction with Suffren's squadron. They were escorting 8 transports and preceeded by the corvette \"Fortune\", under Lusignan. The next day, after ammunition and supplies were distributed among Suffren's ships, they sailed for Trincomalee, where they anchored the same evening.\n\nOn 25 August, after studying the defenses, Suffren landed 2400 men east of the main fortifications. Gun batteries were set up the next day, which then bombarded the fort for three days, until the wall was breached. Captain MacDowel, the British commander, was summoned to surrender on 30 August. After negotiations, the fort's garrison surrendered on condition that the French transport it to Madras and allow it to continue service in the war.\n\nFrench troops entered Trincomalee on 1 September. The next day, Hughes' fleet was spotted approaching the port.\n\nFollowing the battle off Negapatam, Hughes had spent two weeks at sea before putting into Madras for repairs. There he was joined by \"Sceptre\" and \"San Carlos\". Notified by one of his scouts that the French were anchored outside Trincomalee, Hughes lifted anchor and made haste to come to the garrison's aid, but arrived one day too late.\n\nSuffren, now safe within the harbour, held council with his captains. Some of them, led by his second-in-command, had persistently opposed offensive actions against the British, and vigorously renewed their objections to the need for combat. Suffren, after confirming that his fleet outnumbered that of Hughes, argued in favor of action, as the destruction of the British fleet would greatly simplify land operations in pursuit of objectives of the French and their Mysorean allies. He accordingly gave orders to sail out and meet the British fleet.\n\nWhen they exited the harbour, Suffren gave the signal to form the battle line. This command, even after being repeated several times, was poorly executed by his recalcitrant subordinates, and only a ragged line was arranged. Frustrated by this insubordination, Suffren then gave orders to hold fire until close quarters, and tried to communicate this by firing a gun from his flagship, \"Héros\". This shot was misinterpreted by his captains as an order to open fire, and the whole line opened fire on the British fleet, beginning the action.\n\nThe heaviest action was at the center of the lines, where Suffren and Hughes again faced off against each other. \"Héros\" was assisted by \"Illustre\" and \"Ajax\", while Hughes, leading from \"Superb\", was assisted by \"Burford\", \"Sultan\", \"Eagle\", \"Hero\", and \"Monarca\". This lopsided conflict went on for about one hour before Suffren signalled for assistance. \"St. Michel\" and \"Annibal\", commanded by insubordinate captains, stayed away, while \"Brillant\" eventually neared the action and gave some assistance. Thirty minutes later, \"Ajax\" was forced to withdraw with heavy damage, and was replaced by \"Artésien\". An hour later, the situation became critical when \"Héros\"' mainmast came crashing down, and Suffren was forced to scramble to make sure the British did not think that he had struck his colours. He had also run out of ammunition, having fired 1,800 rounds at the British ships, and continued to fire powder alone in an attempt to fool the enemy.\n\nBattle on the ends of the line went more in favor of the French. \"Isis\", \"Worcester\", and \"Monmouth\" were badly damaged, and \"Exeter\", whose captain was killed in the action, was disabled.\n\nAt 5:30 pm, after about three hours of battle, the winds suddenly shifted to the advantage of the French fleet. The ships on the outer ends of their line, which had seen relatively light action, were able to bear on the battle at the center, bringing a new intensity to the battle. \"Hero\" lost her mainmast and mizzenmast, and \"Worcester\" lost her maintopmast. A number of British ships were disabled before night fell and darkness ended the battle.\n\nWhile accounts differ, it appears likely that Suffren may have attempted to give chase when Hughes drew his fleet off and made for Madras. The French fleet entered Trincomalee harbour and began working to repair the extensive damage to the fleet. The damage to the British fleet was so severe that land commanders at Madras recalled troops from the field in case the French attempted an attack there.\n\nAs he had following the battle of Negapatam, Suffren arrested three of his captains and sent them to Île de France for punishment for their performance in the battle. This performance was so noteworthy that even the British commented on it; the \"Calcutta Gazette\" reported that Suffren was very poorly supported by his subordinates, and one commentator wrote that they were \"unworthy to serve so great a man\".\n\nSuffren sailed from Trincomalee on 30 September, arriving at Cuddalore on 4 October. Eleven days later, he sailed for winter quarters in Achin, where he arrived on 7 November.\n\nHughes, who did not want to remain in the exposed anchorage of Madras during the monsoon season, sailed for Bombay. His whole fleet suffered through the early days of the monsoon, and some ships took two months to arrive there.\n\nTotal losses of the French squadrons: 82 killed, 255 wounded \n\nTotal losses of the British squadrons: 51 killed, 285 wounded\n\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\n"}

It is a categorical analogue of a collection of open subsets of a fixed open set in topology. In a Grothendieck topology, certain sieves become categorical analogues of open covers in topology. Sieves were introduced by in order to reformulate the notion of a Grothendieck topology.\n\nLet C be a category, and let \"c\" be an object of C. A sieve formula_1 on \"c\" is a subfunctor of Hom(−, \"c\"), i.e., for all objects \"c\"′ of C, \"S\"(\"c\"′) ⊆ Hom(\"c\"′, \"c\"), and for all arrows \"f\":\"c\"″→\"c\"′, \"S\"(\"f\") is the restriction of Hom(\"f\", \"c\"), the pullback by \"f\" (in the sense of precomposition, not of fiber products), to \"S\"(\"c\"′); see the next section, below.\n\nPut another way, a sieve is a collection \"S\" of arrows with a common codomain that satisfies the functoriality condition, \"If \"g\":\"c\"′→\"c\" is an arrow in \"S\", and if \"f\":\"c\"″→\"c\"′ is any other arrow in C, then the pullback is in \"S\".\" Consequently, sieves are similar to right ideals in ring theory or filters in order theory.\n\nThe most common operation on a sieve is \"pullback\". Pulling back a sieve \"S\" on \"c\" by an arrow \"f\":\"c\"′→\"c\" gives a new sieve \"f\"\"S\" on \"c\"′. This new sieve consists of all the arrows in \"S\" that factor through \"c\"′.\n\nThere are several equivalent ways of defining \"f\"\"S\". The simplest is:\n\nA more abstract formulation is:\n\nHere the map Hom(−, \"c\"′)→Hom(−, \"c\") is Hom(\"f\", \"c\"′), the pullback by \"f\".\n\nThe latter formulation suggests that we can also take the image of \"S\"×Hom(−, \"c\"′) under the natural map to Hom(−, \"c\"). This will be the image of \"f\"\"S\" under composition with \"f\". For each object \"d\" of C, this sieve will consist of all arrows \"fg\", where \"g\":\"d\"→\"c\"′ is an arrow of \"f\"\"S\"(\"d\"). In other words, it consists of all arrows in \"S\" that can be factored through \"f\".\n\nIf we denote by ∅ the empty sieve on \"c\", that is, the sieve for which ∅(\"d\") is always the empty set, then for any \"f\":\"c\"′→\"c\", \"f\"∅ is ∅. Furthermore, \"f\"Hom(−, \"c\") = Hom(−, \"c\"′).\n\nLet \"S\" and \"S\"′ be two sieves on \"c\". We say that \"S\" ⊆ \"S\"′ if for all objects \"c\"′ of C, \"S\"(\"c\"′) ⊆ \"S\"′(\"c\"′). For all objects \"d\" of C, we define (\"S\" ∪ \"S\"′)(\"d\") to be \"S\"(\"d\") ∪ \"S\"′(\"d\") and (\"S\" ∩ \"S\"′)(\"d\") to be \"S\"(\"d\") ∩ \"S\"′(\"d\"). We can clearly extend this definition to infinite unions and intersections as well.\n\nIf we define Sieve(\"c\") (or Sieve(\"c\") for short) to be the set of all sieves on \"c\", then Sieve(\"c\") becomes partially ordered under ⊆. It is easy to see from the definition that the union or intersection of any family of sieves on \"c\" is a sieve on \"c\", so Sieve(\"c\") is a complete lattice.\n\nA Grothendieck topology is a collection of sieves subject to certain properties. These sieves are called \"covering sieves\". The set of all covering sieves on an object \"c\" is a subset \"J\"(\"c\") of Sieve(\"c\"). \"J\"(\"c\") satisfies several properties in addition to those required by the definition:\n\n\nConsequently, \"J\"(\"c\") is also a distributive lattice, and it is cofinal in Sieve(\"c\").\n\n"}

To be considered atomic, upon reading back a just written-to portion of the disk, the storage subsystem must return either the write data or the data that was on that portion of the disk before the write operations.\n\nMost computer disk drives are not considered stable storage because they do not guarantee atomic write; an error could be returned upon subsequent read of the disk where it was just written to in lieu of either the new or prior data.\n\nMultiple techniques have been developed to achieve the atomic property from weakly atomic devices such as disks. Writing data to a disk in two places in a specific way is one technique and can be done by application software.\n\nMost often though, stable storage functionality is achieved by mirroring data on separate disks via RAID technology (level 1 or greater). The RAID controller implements the disk writing algorithms that enable separate disks to act as stable storage.\nThe RAID technique is robust against some single disk failure in an array of disks whereas the software technique of writing to separate areas of the same disk only protects against some kinds of internal disk media failures such as bad sectors in single disk arrangements.\n"}
{"id": "2163562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163562", "title": "Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage", "text": "Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage\n\nThe Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage (or Peaucellier–Lipkin cell, or Peaucellier–Lipkin inversor), invented in 1864, was the first true planar straight line mechanism – the first planar linkage capable of transforming rotary motion into perfect straight-line motion, and vice versa. It is named after Charles-Nicolas Peaucellier (1832–1913), a French army officer, and Yom Tov Lipman Lipkin (1846–1876), a Lithuanian Jew and son of the famed Rabbi Israel Salanter.\n\nUntil this invention, no planar method existed of converting exact straight-line motion to circular motion, without reference guideways. In 1864, all power came from steam engines, which had a piston moving in a straight-line up and down a cylinder. This piston needed to keep a good seal with the cylinder in order to retain the driving medium, and not lose energy efficiency due to leaks. The piston does this by remaining perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, retaining its straight-line motion. Converting the straight-line motion of the piston into circular motion was of critical importance. Most, if not all, applications of these steam engines, were rotary.\n\nThe mathematics of the Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage is directly related to the inversion of a circle.\n\nThere is an earlier straight-line mechanism, whose history is not well known, called the Sarrus linkage. This linkage predates the Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage by 11 years and consists of a series of hinged rectangular plates, two of which remain parallel but can be moved normally to each other. Sarrus' linkage is of a three-dimensional class sometimes known as a space crank, unlike the Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage which is a planar mechanism.\n\nIn the geometric diagram of the apparatus, six bars of fixed length can be seen: OA, OC, AB, BC, CD, DA. The length of OA is equal to the length of OC, and the lengths of AB, BC, CD, and DA are all equal forming a rhombus. Also, point O is fixed. Then, if point B is constrained to move along a circle (shown in red) which passes through O, then point D will necessarily have to move along a straight line (shown in blue). On the other hand, if point B were constrained to move along a line (not passing through O), then point D would necessarily have to move along a circle (passing through O).\n\nFirst, it must be proven that points O, B, D are collinear. This may be easily seen by observing that the linkage is mirror-symmetric about line OD, so point B must fall on that line.\n\nMore formally, triangles BAD and BCD are congruent because side BD is congruent to itself, side BA is congruent to side BC, and side AD is congruent to side CD. Therefore, angles ABD and CBD are equal.\n\nNext, triangles OBA and OBC are congruent, since sides OA and OC are congruent, side OB is congruent to itself, and sides BA and BC are congruent. Therefore, angles OBA and OBC are equal.\n\nFinally, because they form a complete circle, we have\n\nbut, due to the congruences, angle OBA = angle OBC and angle DBA = angle DBC, thus\n\ntherefore points O, B, and D are collinear.\n\nLet point P be the intersection of lines AC and BD. Then, since ABCD is a rhombus, P is the midpoint of both line segments BD and AC. Therefore, length BP = length PD.\n\nTriangle BPA is congruent to triangle DPA, because side BP is congruent to side DP, side AP is congruent to itself, and side AB is congruent to side AD. Therefore, angle BPA = angle DPA. But since angle BPA + angle DPA = 180°, then 2 × angle BPA = 180°, angle BPA = 90°, and angle DPA = 90°.\n\nLet:\n\nThen:\n\nSince OA and AD are both fixed lengths, then the product of OB and OD is a constant:\n\nand since points O, B, D are collinear, then D is the inverse of B with respect to the circle (O,\"k\") with center O and radius \"k\".\n\nThus, by the properties of inversive geometry, since the figure traced by point D is the inverse of the figure traced by point B, if B traces a circle passing through the center of inversion O, then D is constrained to trace a straight line. But if B traces a straight line not passing through O, then D must trace an arc of a circle passing through O. \"Q.E.D.\"\n\nPeaucellier–Lipkin linkages (PLLs) may have several inversions. A typical example is shown in the opposite figure, in which a rocker-slider four-bar serves as the input driver. To be precise, the slider acts as the input, which in turn drives the right grounded link of the PLL, thus driving the entire PLL.\n\nSylvester (\"Collected Works\", Vol. 3, Paper 2) writes that when he showed a model to Kelvin, he “nursed it as if it had been his own child, and when a motion was made to relieve him of it, replied ‘No! I have not had nearly enough of it—it is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life.’”\nA monumental-scale sculpture implementing the linkage in illuminated struts is on permanent exhibition in Eindhoven, Netherlands. The artwork measures , weighs , and can be operated from a control panel accessible to the general public.\n\n\n\n"}

Furthermore, groups of people can huddle together in this position to conserve body heat, offer moral support, and provide a larger target for rescuers. \n\nThe HELP is an attempt to reduce heat loss enough to lessen the effect of hypothermia. Hypothermia is essentially a condition where bodily temperature drops too low to perform normal voluntary or involuntary functions. Cold water causes \"immersion hypothermia\", which can cause damage to extremities or the body's core, including unconsciousness or death.\n\nThe HELP reduces exposure of high heat loss areas of the body. Wearing a personal flotation device allows a person to draw their knees to their chest and arms to their sides, while still remaining able to breathe.\n\n"}

{"id": "2163614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163614", "title": "Pseudoknot", "text": "Pseudoknot\n\nA pseudoknot is a nucleic acid secondary structure containing at least two stem-loop structures in which half of one stem is intercalated between the two halves of another stem. The pseudoknot was first recognized in the turnip yellow mosaic virus in 1982. Pseudoknots fold into knot-shaped three-dimensional conformations but are not true topological knots.\n\nThe structural configuration of pseudoknots does not lend itself well to bio-computational detection due to its context-sensitivity or “overlapping” nature. The base pairing in pseudoknots is not well nested; that is, base pairs occur that \"overlap\" one another in sequence position. This makes the presence of pseudoknots in RNA sequences more difficult to predict by the standard method of dynamic programming, which use a recursive scoring system to identify paired stems and consequently, most cannot detect non-nested base pairs. The newer method of stochastic context-free grammars suffers from the same problem. Thus, popular secondary structure prediction methods like Mfold and Pfold will not predict pseudoknot structures present in a query sequence; they will only identify the more stable of the two pseudoknot stems.\n\nIt is possible to identify a limited class of pseudoknots using dynamic programming, but these methods are not exhaustive and scale worse as a function of sequence length than non-pseudoknotted algorithms. The general problem of predicting lowest free energy structures with pseudoknots has been shown to be NP-complete.\n\nSeveral important biological processes rely on RNA molecules that form pseudoknots, which are often RNAs with extensive tertiary structure. For example, the pseudoknot region of RNase P is one of the most conserved elements in all of evolution. The telomerase RNA component contains a pseudoknot that is critical for activity, and several viruses use a pseudoknot structure to form a tRNA-like motif to infiltrate the host cell.\n\nMany types of pseudoknots exist, differing by how they cross and how many times they cross. To reflect this difference, pseudoknots are classed into H-, K-, L-, M-types, with each successive type adding a layer of step intercalation. The simple telomerase P2b-P3 example in the article, for example, is an H-type pesudoknot.\n\nRNA secondary structure is usually represented by the dot-bracket notation, with pairing round brackets codice_1 indicating basepairs in a stem and dots representing loops. The interrupted stems of pseudoknots mean that such notation must be extended with extra brackets, or even letters, so that different sets of stems can be represented. One such extension uses, in nesting order, codice_2 for opening and codice_3 for closing. The structure for the two (slightly varying) telomerase examples, in this notation, is:\n\nNote that U bulge at the end is normally present in telomerase RNA. It was removed in the 1ymo solution model for enhanced stability of the pseudoknot.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2163615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163615", "title": "Batcave (club)", "text": "Batcave (club)\n\nThe Batcave was a weekly club-night launched at 69 Dean Street in central London in July 1982. It is considered to be the birthplace of the Southern English goth subculture as it had already been established in Northern England, in particular Leeds and Manchester, and in Belfast, though when the culture was being developed in the North it was commonly known as \"alternative\" before being given the goth moniker. As one of the most famous meeting points for early goths, it lent its name to the term Batcaver, used to describe fans of the original gothic rock music, who would adorn themselves in Batwing coffin necklaces to distinguish themselves from other less prolific goth clubs.\n\nThe Batcave opened every Wednesday at the Gargoyle Club in Soho from 21 July 1982. Originally specialising in new wave and glam rock, it later focused on gothic rock. Olli Wisdom, the lead singer in the house band Specimen, ran the night with Specimen's guitarist Jon Klein as art director, and initially with the assistance of production manager Hugh Jones. Famous regulars at the Batcave who came for meeting friends and having a drink, included musicians and singers such as Nick Cave, Robert Smith of the Cure, Siouxsie Sioux, Steven Severin, the members of Bauhaus, Marc Almond and the members of Foetus.\n\nAn array of bands would play live, alongside 4-hour sets from their resident DJ Hamish MacDonald, with a guest DJ upstairs when the club-night transferred to the Subway club in Leicester Square in February 1983, with a US Army jeep parked by the bar. (The Batcave later decamped to Fooberts in Soho). The bands involved included electronic leading act Alien Sex Fiend, the host's band Specimen who took influence from 1970s glam rock, Hamish's band Sexbeat, and Sex Gang Children, who would go on to prove influential in the gothic rock, dark cabaret and deathrock movements. The club also showed 8mm films in the Gargoyle's old theatre and occasionally featured unusual cabaret such as Mr Swing the Fakir and mud-wrestling. Olli Wisdom told \"The Face\": “We don’t suck our cheeks, we have fun.” In an interview for Mick Mercer's \"Gothic Rock\", Jonny (Slut) Melton said of the Batcave: \"It was a light bulb for all the freaks and people like myself who were from the sticks and wanted a bit more from life. Freaks, weirdos, sexual deviants ... There's people around who'll always be attracted by something shiny, glittering, exciting. At the time the Batcave wasn't a doomy, Gothy, droney grungey sort of place ... It was more Gotham City than Aleister Crowley.\"\n\nAs the terms \"new punks\" and \"goth\" became interchangeable, much of the image and fashion adopted by the subculture can be traced back to the bands that played at the Batcave. In 1983, a vinyl record entitled \"The Batcave: Young Limbs And Numb Hymns\" was released on the London Records label. The compilation included Specimen (\"Dead Mans Autochop\"), Sexbeat (\"Sexbeat\"), Test Dept. (\"Shockwork\"), Patti Palladin (\"The Nuns New Clothes\"), James T. Pursey (\"Eyes Shine Killidiscope\"), Meat of Youth (\"Meat of Youth\"), Brilliant (\"Coming Up for the Downstroke\"), Alien Sex Fiend (\"R.I.P.\"), and The Venomettes (\"The Dance of Death\"). The inside notes: \"Look past the slow black rain of a chill night in Soho; Ignore the lures of a thousand neon fire-flies, fall deft to the sighs of street corner sirens — come walk with me between heaven and hell. Here there is a club lost in its own feverish limbo, where sin becomes salvation and only the dark angels tread. For here is a BATCAVE. This screaming legend of blasphemy, Lechery, and Blood persists in the face of adversity. For some the Batcave has become an icon, but for those that know it is an iconoclast, it is the avenging spirit of nightlife's badlands — its shadow looms large over London's demi-Monde: It is a challenge to the false Idol. It Will Endure.\"\n\nIn terms of contemporary club culture, the Batcave has to be seen as the root of indie dance music. Its two rules: 'No Funk, No Disco' set it apart from the norm of club music in the early-80s. It was the first club specifically geared to provide a dance floor for punk, rock, rockabilly, glam, reggae, garage, and psychedelia. Within months, the DJ setlist was being quoted in \"The Face\" and \"Sounds\", and the club began setting a soundtrack for the mid-1980s.\n\nIn 2008, Specimen played live at a 25th Anniversary Batcave party hosted by Club Antichrist in London. The show was recorded as a live album, \"Specimen Alive at the Batcave\" and released on Eyeswideshut/Metropolis Records.\nIn 2009, Specimen's Jonny Slut and Jon Klein appeared at New York's Fashion Institute of Technology following the exhibition 'Gothic Dark Glamour', which featured Jon Klein's 1983 'Pigeon Shit' DIY stage outfit alongside high fashion designers such as Christian Dior and Alexander McQueen. The Fashion Symposium acknowledged the Batcave as a major influence on prevailing high fashion.\n\n"}

He is also a Board Member of Mainstream Renewable Power. At various times he has been General Secretary of the Labour Party, a Teachta Dála (TD), and a Member of the European Parliament (MEP).\n\nHalligan was born in Dublin in 1936. He was educated at St James's Christian Brothers School and Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin, he graduated with a master's degree from University College Dublin in 1964. Following an early career as an economist, working with the Irish Sugar Company until 1967, he became involved in politics. In that year, he became General Secretary of the Labour Party.\n\nThe party leader, Brendan Corish, relied on Halligan's intellectual and political skills in his new role. Under Halligan, the party underwent an energetic reorganisation. New structures and policies were put in place, coinciding with the party's leftward policy shift and an acute anti-coalition stance. He strongly supported both approaches, but was instrumental in securing the party's eventual, somewhat unwilling, reversal of its anti-coalition stance after its disappointing result in the 1969 general election. The 1973 general election resulted in a Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition government coming to power.\n\nHalligan was appointed to Seanad Éireann in 1973; three years later, he won a by-election in Dublin South-West, and thus became a TD. After boundary changes, he stood in the new Dublin Finglas at the 1977 general election, but was not elected. Halligan stood again in the revived Dublin North-West constituency at the 1981 and November 1982 general elections, but again was not elected.\n\nHe continued to serve as General Secretary of the party until 1980, and was appointed a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1983 until 1984, replacing Frank Cluskey, where he specialised in economic affairs and energy policy.\n\nIn 1980, Halligan set up CIPA, his own public affairs consultancy based in Dublin, and became a lecturer in Economics at the University of Limerick.

{"id": "2163628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163628", "title": "Battle of Lagos", "text": "Battle of Lagos\n\nThe naval Battle of Lagos took place between a British fleet commanded by Sir Edward Boscawen and a French fleet under Jean-François de La Clue-Sabran over two days in 1759 during the Seven Years' War. They fought south west of the Gulf of Cádiz on 18 August and to the east of the small Portuguese port of Lagos, after which the battle is named, on the 19th.\n\nLa Clue was attempting to evade Boscawen and bring the French Mediterranean Fleet into the Atlantic, avoiding battle if possible; he was then under orders to sail for the West Indies. Boscawen was under orders to prevent a French breakout into the Atlantic, and to pursue and fight the French if they did. During the evening of 17 August the French fleet successfully passed through the Strait of Gibraltar, but was sighted by a British ship shortly after it entered the Atlantic. The British fleet was in nearby Gibraltar, undergoing a major refit. It left port amidst great confusion, most ships not having their refurbishments completed, with many delayed and sailing in a second squadron. Aware that he was pursued, La Clue altered his plan and changed course; half of his ships failed to follow him in the dark, but the British did.\n\nThe British caught up with the French on the 18th and fierce fighting ensued, during which several ships were badly damaged and one French ship was captured. The British, who greatly outnumbered the remaining six French ships, pursued them through the moonlit night of 18/19 August; during which a further two French ships made their escape. On the 19th the remnants of the French fleet attempted to shelter in neutral Portuguese waters near Lagos, but Boscawen violated that neutrality, capturing a further two French ships and destroying the other two.\n\nThe endemic ill feeling between France and Great Britain during the 18th century turned into open warfare in 1754 and 1755. In 1756 what become known as the Seven Years' War broke out across Europe, pitching France, Austria and Russia against Britain and Prussia. France supported Austria and Russia in a land campaign against Prussia, and launched what it saw as its main effort in a maritime and colonial offensive against Britain.\n\nBy the beginning of 1759 neither alliance had the advantage, in either the land or sea campaigns, and both were having serious problems financing the war. In 1759 more than 60 per cent of French revenue went to service its debt, causing numerous shortages. The French Navy in particular was overstretched and suffered from the lack of a coherent doctrine, exacerbated by the inexperience verging on incompetence of the secretary of state for the navy, Nicolas René Berryer, a former chief of police. Meanwhile, Britain's war effort up to early 1757 had been a failure, with setbacks in Europe, North America, India and at sea. From June 1757 it came under the control of the assertive new secretary of state for the southern department (foreign minister), William Pitt, who imposed a coordinated strategy. By early 1759 this was beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn response to the British successes, the ministers of the French king Louis XV planned a direct invasion of Britain, which, if successful, would have decided the war in their favour. An army of 17,000 was collected at Vannes, in the south east of Brittany, and nearly 100 transports were assembled near Quiberon Bay. In its final form the French plan required these transports to be escorted by the French navy. However, at the best of times the French struggled to crew their full fleet with experienced mariners; landsmen could be used, but even a small deficiency in ship handling translated into a marked handicap in combat. Three years into the war, thousands of French seamen were held as prisoners by the British; many more were engaged in speculative, and occasionally lucrative, privateering careers; and the unhealthy conditions, onerous onboard discipline and poor wages, paid late, were a strong disincentive to service. The transports also required at least a cadre of skilled men.\n\nThe French possessed 73 ships of the line, the largest warships of the time: 30 serving abroad and 43 in home waters. The latter were split between the Atlantic port of Brest (22 ships) and the Mediterranean port of Toulon, with a small number at two ports on the Bay of Biscay: Lorient and Rochefort. In total these ships required an aggregate complement of about 25,000 men; they were more than 9,000 short of this. The British had 40 ships of the line in home waters, and a further 15 in their Mediterranean Fleet, which was based in Gibraltar.\n\nIn May 1759 Edward Boscawen took command of the British fleet in the Mediterranean. As well as 15 ships of the line he also had 12 frigates – smaller and faster than ships of the line and primarily intended for raiding, reconnaissance and messaging. He was tasked with harassing the French, protecting British merchant shipping, and ensuring the safety of the British outpost and naval base at Gibraltar. By late July the ships of the British fleet were low on supplies and in urgent need of maintenance after their prolonged period at sea, during which some ships had been damaged by enemy action. The fleet retired to Gibraltar, arriving on 4 August. There they began the difficult process of scraping the bottoms of the ships free of barnacles and seaweed, repairing and replacing their rigging and replacing spars. While this refurbishment was under way, fresh orders arrived, alerting Boscawen to the likelihood that the French Mediterranean Fleet would attempt to join up with their Atlantic Fleet, probably at Brest, and instructing him to prevent it. He ordered the first two of his frigates to be ready for sea to patrol to the east, where the Mediterranean narrowed to the bottleneck of the Strait of Gibraltar, to give warning if the French were to attempt to break out.\n\nEarlier in the year, an aspect of the British strategy had played out in the West Indies. In February, 4,000 British soldiers landed on the French West Indian possession of Guadeloupe. This island's immense sugar production was supposed to exceed that of all of the British Leeward Islands combined. After great difficulties in preparing them for sea, nine French ships of the line, under Maximin de Bompart, were despatched to relieve the island. They arrived the day after the French governor surrendered to the British on 1 May.\n\nNews of this disaster was passed back to Paris, where after deliberation it was decided to reinforce Bompart's force with the Mediterranean Fleet. Orders to sail reached its commander, Admiral Jean-François de La Clue-Sabran, at the end of July, and it left Toulon on 5 August. It consisted of twelve ships of the line and three frigates. La Clue intended to pass the Strait of Gibraltar by night, in order to keep the British in ignorance of his absence from the Mediterranean. He anticipated this might scatter his fleet, and he had ordered his ships to rendezvous off the Spanish port of Cadiz. During the late evening of 17 August the French passed through the strait, but were observed shortly afterwards by the British frigate HMS \"Gibraltar\". The French were aware they had been spotted, and realising by now that the British fleet was in Gibraltar, anticipated a prompt pursuit.\n\nThe approach of the \"Gibraltar\", firing her guns to indicate the enemy had been sighted, took the British by surprise. There was a scramble to get under way. Most captains and many crew were ashore; some, including Boscawen, were dining several miles away. Most ships sailed without their captains, some under the command of junior officers. Their seniors followed on as best they could – the flagship, HMS \"Namur\", sailed with three captains and the admiral on board – and sorted themselves out as circumstances allowed. Many officers and men were left ashore. Several ships were barely seaworthy. The process of fitting, or \"bending\", sails to the masts of the large warships of the time was a complicated one, and most British ships were forced to do this as they got under way, in the dark, undermanned and with few officers. Some were also fitting spars or even stepping in their topmasts. Ships were cluttered with material for their refits and with unstowed stores. HMS \"Prince\" had so many casks on one of her gun decks as to be unable to operate that deck's guns; HMS \"America\" threw large amounts of loose material overboard. Despite these difficulties, by 11:00 pm, within three hours of \"Gibraltar\" appearing, eight British ships of the line had warped out of the harbour and were heading for the Atlantic. Several ships were left behind, under Vice-Admiral Thomas Brodrick, with orders to sail as soon as they could be made fit for sea.\n\nShips sailing at night usually displayed lanterns from their sterns and masts, so as to avoid collisions and to allow groups of ships to maintain contact. Wishing to be as inconspicuous as possible, the French ships probably did not follow this practice. The French ships had all been issued with sealed orders, which they were to open on passing the Strait of Gibraltar; these instructed them that the fleet was to rendezvous at Cádiz. Knowing they had been observed by the British, La Clue changed his plan. Instead of heading for Cádiz, where he feared he could be easily blockaded by the British, he decided to sail more westerly, to clear Cape St. Vincent and head into the North Atlantic. However, the French navy did not have an effective system of night signalling. So at about midnight La Clue had his flagship, \"Océan\", light her stern lantern, turn to port (left, or westward) and reduce her speed. Normally, such actions would be accompanied by the firing of cannon to draw attention. The naval historian Sam Willis suggests it is possible that La Cluewho had been ordered to avoid battle at all costsknowing that the entire fleet was relatively close, and not wishing to advertise his manoeuvre to the British, omitted to do this.\n\nEight of the fifteen ships in the French fleet continued on to Cádiz. It is not clear if this was because they did not observe the flagship's change of course, because they did not understand its implications, or because they felt their freshly opened orders took precedence. At dawn on 18 August La Clue could only see six other ships. He ordered them to rally on the flagship and heave to and await the anticipated appearance of the rest of the fleet. At about 6:00 am a group of large ships came into view and La Clue remained stationary, believing them to be the missing component of his fleet. It was only when the topsails of the nine ships of the second British squadron, the stragglers under Brodrick, were sighted further back that it was realised that all of these ships were British.\n\nThe seven French ships sailed at the speed of their slowest member, the \"Souverain\". Boscawen ordered his ships to maintain formation, to avoid his fastest ships reaching and engaging the French squadron individually and being defeated in detail. The British ships proved to be faster, and were slightly favoured by variable winds, allowing them to gradually overhaul the French by the afternoon of 18 August. Boscawen repeatedly signalled to his ships to \"Make more speed\". Several of the British ships were hampered by their newly warped sails splitting, or their newly fitted spars breaking loose, as they were overstrained by crews eager to catch the French. At 1:00 pm the French ships hoisted their battle ensigns and opened fire at long range. Ships of the line had most of their guns mounted in their sides, to allow them to fire broadsides, but had a small number of lighter guns mounted in their sterns, able to fire to their rears. It was not possible to effectively fire ahead of such ships. The French were thus able to fire at the British as they grew closer, while the British were unable to offer much reply. The French attempted to disable the British ships' sails and rigging, but with little effect.\n\nAt 2:30 pm the British \"Culloden\" engaged the rearmost French ship, the \"Centaure\"; they were evenly matched, each being equipped with 74 heavy guns, 37 on each side. By this time the French had formed a line ahead formation, with their flagship in the centre. Boscawen claimed he wished his leading, and therefore his fastest, ships to engage the first French ships they encountered; then, as the next British ship arrived, bypass this fight to attack the next French ship in line. Any bypassed French ships could, he believed, be safely left to Brodrick's squadron. However, only his own flagship adopted this approach, and only four of the seven French ships were engaged. \"Centaure\" was attacked by five British ships, fighting on for five hours and seriously delaying the British pursuit before surrendering after being battered into a wreck and having more than a third of her crew killed or wounded.\n\nMeanwhile, Boscawen had pressed on in his 90-gun flagship, determined to engage the largest ship in the French fleet, La Clue's flagship, the 80-gun \"Océan\". \"Namur\" passed three French ships, receiving a broadside from each; Boscawen ordered that there be no return fire, instead having his crew lie down, to minimise casualties. By 4:00 pm \"Namur\" was close enough to \"Océan\" to open fire and a short, sharp fight developed. \"Océan\" had nearly 200 men killed or wounded, with La Clue among the latter; while \"Namur\" had one of her three masts shot away, together with the topsail yards of both remaining masts. With \"Namur\" unable to manoeuvre, \"Océan\", also badly damaged, fled. Boscawen transferred his flag to .\n\nAs the sun set, the six surviving French ships continued to flee to the north west, with those British ships not slowed by battle damage close behind them. There was sufficient moonlight to allow the British ships to keep in touch, although the two fastest French ships, \"Souverain\" and \"Guerrier\", slipped away into the Atlantic during the night. The naval historian Nicholas Tracey suggests La Clue sailed an incorrect course, failed to Cape St. Vincent, and became trapped against a lee shore. The badly wounded La Clue now had command only over his flagship and three other ships of the line, \"Redoutable\", \"Téméraire\" and \"Modeste\", none of which had yet been engaged. Despairing of escape, he led the remnants of his fleet to a small river west of Lagos in Portugal. Portugal was neutral and it would be illegal for Boscawen to attack him there. There was also a small Portuguese fort overlooking the anchorage and La Clue may have hoped this would be some deterrent.\n\nAs Boscawen approached in \"Newark\", the Portuguese opened fire and he hove to outside of cannon range and selected several ships to attack the French \"without any regard to the laws of neutrality.\" The British \"America\" attacked \"Océan\", firing a broadside from short range and demanding that she surrender. The French, who had been in the process of abandoning ship, struck their colours. The British were unable to tow Océan off as she had been run ashore with some force in order to prevent this. So they evacuated those left of the crew and set fire to her; several hours later, around midnight, the fire reached her magazine and she exploded.\n\nThree ships from Brodrick's rear squadron were sent in after the \"Redoutable\". HMS \"Prince\" fired repeatedly into her and then boarded her. She was also firmly beached and so, like \"Océan\", she was torched, and also exploded several hours later. Having observed \"Océan\" and \"Redoutable\" set alight and seeing HMS \"Jersey\" sailing towards them the crew of \"Modeste\" fled or surrendered and she was towed out, little damaged, to the British fleet; \"Jersey\" was fired on by the Portuguese forts during this operation. The last French ship, \"Téméraire\", was attacked by \"Warspite\" at 2:45 pm, but her crew refused to surrender. \"Warspite\" manoeuvred so as to be able to fire into \"Téméraire\"s stern, where the French could do little to fire back, and after an hour \"Téméraire\" also struck her colours and was towed out.\n\nThe French had 500 men killed, wounded or captured; against 56 British fatalities and 196 wounded. La Clue, seriously wounded, was carried ashore before the British arrived and survived; five years later he was promoted to Lieutenant-General. The battle had no effect on the French plans to invade Britain. The two French ships which escaped from the battle eventually reached Rochefort. The five French ships in Cadiz were blockaded by Boscawen's second-in-command, Admiral Brodrick. They were instructed to head for French Atlantic ports if they were able to break this blockade, with a view to reinforcing the fleet in Brest. But by the time they evaded Brodrick during a winter storm in January 1760, the French Atlantic Fleet had been destroyed at the Battle of Quiberon Bay, and they returned to Toulon instead.\n\nHearing the news of the victory, the notoriously nervous British prime minister, the Duke of Newcastle, said \"I was afraid of invasion till now.\" Boscawen's violation of Portuguese neutrality was fully supported by his government, which placated the Portuguese by persuading them that it was an inadvertent result of Boscawen's general chase order. Three years later, the Spanish and French governments used this breach of neutrality as one of their pretexts for declaring war on and invading Portugal. Boscawen, his captains and their crews were fêted in Britain. After completing their interrupted refits, several of Boscawen's victorious ships were transferred to Admiral Edward Hawke's fleet off Brest, and five were with Hawke when he destroyed the Brest fleet in Quiberon Bay in November. The three captured French ships went on to serve in the British navy as HMS \"Centaur\", \"Modeste\" and \"Temeraire\". The historian Sarah Kinkel describes the Battle of Lagos as a \"definitive\" victory. The battle was one of a series of British victories in 1759 which caused the year to be known as an \"annus mirabilis\" (Latin for year of wonders).\n\nServing on board \"Océan\" as a junior officer was Pierre André de Suffren, who was later to gain fame as an admiral leading a French fleet in the Indian Ocean. A young slave named Olaudah Equiano, who would later become a prominent abolitionist in England, participated in the engagement on the British side. He included an account of the battle in his autobiography, \"The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano\".\n\nShips of the line:\n\"Prince\" 90 \n\"Newark\" 80 \n\"Warspite\" 74 \n\"Culloden\" 74 \n\"Conqueror\" 70 \n\"Swiftsure\" 70 \n\"Edgar\" 64 \n\"St Albans\" 64 \n\"America\" 60 \n\"Princess Louisa\" 60 \n\"Jersey\" 60 \n\"Guernsey\" 50 \n\"Portland\" 50\n\nFrigates:\n\nSloops:\n\nTwo fireships\nShips which participated in the battle:\n\nShips of the line:\n\"Centaure\" 74 – captured 18 August\n\n\"Océan\" 80 (flag) – run aground and burnt 19 August\n\"\" 74 – run aground and burnt 19 August\n\"Téméraire\" 74 – captured 19 August\n\"Modeste\" 64 – captured 19 August\n\n\"Souverain\" 74 – escaped\n\"Guerrier\" 74 – escaped\n\nShips which became separated at night and sailed to Cadiz:\n\nShips of the line:\n\"Triton\" 64\n\"\" 64\n\"Fantasque\" 64\n\"Fier\" 50\n\"Oriflamme\" 50\n\nFrigates: \n\"Minerve\" 26\n\"Chimère\" 26\n\"Gracieuse\" 26\n\n"}

Mongla is located from the city of Khulna, which is a regional industrial center. Due to increasing congestion in Bangladesh's largest port in Chittagong, many international shipping companies have turned to Mongla as an alternative.\n\nMongla is a gateway for tourist ships traveling to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the region, including the Sundarbans and the Mosque City of Bagerhat. The port also hosts the Mongla Export Processing Zone (Mongla EPZ).\n\nThe port was founded in 1950 to serve the southwestern region of East Bengal. It was originally known as Chalna Port.\n\nIt was formerly located at Chalna, about upstream on the Pasur River but it is now located 48 km south of Khulna city, as established on 11 December 1954. The Port is surrounded and protected by the Sundarban mangrove forest. The port is situated at the confluence of the Pasur River and the Mongla River. It lies about north of the Bay of Bengal.\n\nThe port has 11 jetties and 8 warehouses. It uses 12 swinging moorings in deeper sections in the river. The port is connected by the Bangladesh Railway to the Khulna Metropolitan Area.\n\nIn 2015-16, 636 ships used Mongla port. Mongla is connected to most major ports in the world, particularly Asian ports. Hundreds of ships use the port each year, most of which come via Singapore, Hong Kong and Colombo. Mongla is also connected to most inland ports in Bangladesh, including the Port of Dhaka and the Port of Narayanganj.\n\nFollowing a coastal shipping agreement with India, Mongla has a direct shipping route with the Port of Kolkata in the neighbouring Indian state of West Bengal. A coastal shipping agreement has also been signed with Thailand.\n\nThe port is open for 24 hours and up to 225 metre long ships can enter into the port for discharging cargo.

This rivalry does not appear to be based on differing opinions on dogma or doctrine, only a sort of jealousy, with each sect seeking to be the chief or sole Tendai core temple. Following the deaths of Enchin in 891, this rivalry only deepened, and over the next several centuries, led to a number of armed conflicts. Most were the result of a monk from one faction becoming appointed Abbot (\"zasu\") of the other faction's temple, or of one faction not being invited to events, conferences, or festivals held by the other.\n\nAs the disagreements escalated into armed conflicts, both sects formed the first standing armies of warrior monks, called \"sōhei\".

However, the division and disagreement lasted several centuries longer, until both temples were destroyed by the forces of Oda Nobunaga at the end of the 16th century. Though it is unclear when the names Jimon and Sanmon fell out of use, and when the two temples ceased fighting, the destruction of both temples by a greater, larger outside force brought a definite end to their quarrels.\n"}
{"id": "2163674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163674", "title": "La Follette Committee", "text": "La Follette Committee\n\nIn the United States Senate, the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee, or more formally, Committee on Education and Labor, Subcommittee Investigating Violations of Free Speech and the Rights of Labor (1936-1941), began as an inquiry into a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) investigation of methods used by employers in certain industries to avoid collective bargaining with unions.\n\nBetween 1936 and 1941, the subcommittee published exhaustive hearings and reports on the use of industrial espionage, private police agencies, strikebreaking services, munitions in industrial warfare, and employers' associations to break strikes and to disrupt legal union activities in other ways. Robert M. La Follette, Jr., a Republican and Progressive Party Senator from Wisconsin, chaired the Committee.\n\nThe Committee investigated the five largest detective agencies: the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, the William J. Burns International Detective Agency, the National Corporation Service, the Railway Audit and Inspection Company, and the Corporations Auxiliary Company. Most of the agencies subpoenaed, including the Pinkerton Agency, attempted to destroy their records before receiving the subpoenas, but enough evidence remained to \"piece together a picture of intrigue\". It was revealed that Pinkerton had operatives \"in practically every union in the country\". Of 1,228 operatives, there were five in the United Mine Workers, nine in the United Rubber Workers, seventeen in the United Textile Workers, and fifty-five in the United Auto Workers that had organized General Motors.\n\nThe Committee reported that as late as 1937, its census of working labor spies from 1933 to 1937 totaled 3,871 for the period. Private security firms like the Pinkerton National Detective Agency and Burns were employed to infiltrate labor unions. The Committee concluded that espionage was \"the most efficient method known to management to prevent unions from forming, to weaken them if they secure a foothold, and to wreck them when they try their strength.\"\n\nThe Committee also reported:\n\nSuch a spy system ... places the employer in the very heart of the union council from the outset of any organizing effort. News of organizers coming into a town, contacts the organizers make among his employees, the names of employees who join the union, all organization plans, all activities of the union—these are as readily available to the employer as though he himself were running the union.\n\nAlthough the inquiry by the Committee achieved minor legal resolutions, it failed to achieve any effective regulatory legislation that might have curtailed the worst practices of strike-breaking agencies. Despite this, the revelations enraged the public as it brought more attention to the grievances of laborers.\n\nThe La Follette Committee was created after the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. In an effort to employ the best suited labor management system between unions and employers, the National Labor Relations Act established the National Labor Relations Board. Heber Blankenhorn, of the NLRB, began the La Follette Committee and was its conspirator for four years. A subcommittee then became established as the chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, Senator Elbert Thomas of Utah, appointed Wisconsin Senator La Follette Jr. to manage the organization. Labeled \"Son of the Wild Jackass,\" and with a prominent politician as a brother, the reputation of La Follette Jr.'s family preceded him. As the newly appointed chairman to the subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, La Follette's committee consisted of pro-Republican staff members. La Follette's gifted team of researchers, investigators, attorneys, and writers arose as a prominent governmental team supporting mass labor during the New Deal administration.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1937, the La Follette Committee began its assessment of four prominent anti-union practices which suppressed the advancement of organized laborers. The Committee's intentions lay in preserving the rights of the worker when denied by employers, and in 1937, found industrial espionage to be a common tool employed against unions. From \"motion-picture producers to steel makers,\" the enormous number of companies resorting to espionage, reported the La Follette Committee, prevented the practice of collective bargaining between companies and employees. Spies of corporations befriended victims into creating reports which they used to forewarn employers of potential strikes and assemblies. Spying, the La Follette Committee declared, weakens unions and \"incites to violence, preaches strikes, inflames the hot-headed and leads the union to disaster\". Detective agencies and those utilizing industrial espionage resorted to the protection against radicalism, exposure of theft, deterrence of sabotage, and improvement of labor-management relations as justification of their actions. The Federal Union of Automobile Workers, consisting of 26,000 members in the General Motors plant in 1934, was reported as having at least several spies in the union's executive board. Within two years, membership of the union dropped to merely 120. The Committee affirmed that through the employment of espionage, employees became subjugated to private corporations and were denied constitutional rights.\n\nThe Committee revealed that when espionage failed to prevent unionism, employers also exploited workers through the use of munitions in anticipation of labor trouble. With the threat of communism sweeping the nation and employers utilizing it as a scapegoat to deter unionization, munitions companies distributed various forms of deterrence. Machine guns, tear gas bombs, and clubs were a few of the hindrances wielded to prevent and disperse union meetings. The Committee declared the use of these munitions as the demise of \"labor relations,\" based upon the companies' lack of acknowledgment toward unions and only in their best economic interests. By preventing workers from freely gathering in public spaces, employers who opposed them with the use of munitions and other forms of physical coercion denied them their constitutional rights of freedom of speech and assembly. \nStrikebreakers were reported to be the third form of anti-union oppression utilized by employers. The Committee reported many being convicted criminals, and the animosity of the strikers held towards these men creates \"violence and bloodshed.\" The La Follette Committee confirmed the accounts of former strike breakers who described to them their role in promoting violence in an effort to display the wrongdoings of strikers.\n\nPrivate police agencies offered employers the last form of union oppression. This form of industrial coercion proved to be clear by constitutional protection as the men employed by the corporations were not held accountable to anyone but their employers. Witnesses in industrial communities revealed to the Committee the abusive power of private police; their constant harassment and use of physical violence repressed the First Amendment rights of citizens. Like espionage, munitions utilization, and strikebreaking, private police agencies testified to the incompatibility of industrial tyranny over the liberties of industrial workers.\n\nOn behalf of the National Labor Relations Board, the Committee made preliminary investigations in California in 1936 and 1938. Paul Taylor, one of the left-liberal staff members appointed by La Follette and his Marine Corps friend, urged him to investigate the West Coast; without the necessary funding though, the committee's chairman was doubtful. With a lack in financial stability, the committee's future seemed tentative; support from the La Follette's administration, left-sided Californians, and various worker based organizing groups, however, allowed for the committees continued existence. In 1939, with an allocation of $50,000 presented by a newly appointed California senator and with the books, The Grapes of Wrath and Factories in the Field, exposing California's working conditions to the country, the La Follette Committee was given further incentive to investigate the West Coast. The results were testimonies being held in newly opened offices in the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nDespite La Follette urging his investigative team to search for infringements on constitutional rights of workers rather than the political affiliations of employers, his work became deemed as a backing to Communism and became resented by those harboring anti-union ideals. Aside from employers, local law enforcement agencies, and growers showing a lack in intimidation from the committee, Republican attorney general Earl Warren demonstrated strong opposition by supporting law enforcement in resisting subpoenas. Despite strong resentment to the committee's efforts, it succeeded in depicting the premise of the Violations: California laborers of the 1930s were being denied constitutional rights by employers and anti-union officials. The committee found the West Coast region under the control of a convoluted array of employer controlled associations. The premise of the Committee's California study, \"the existence of the National Labor Relations Act, the reaction of employee or employer organizations to its application, and their long struggle to realize or frustrate benefits which it promised,\" proved as a significant aspect of the Committee's investigation. With its findings from the West Coast investigation, the committee found the economic interests of the employers to be guiding their actions in denying constitutional rights to their employees. As a result, the Committee appealed to the government to intervene in the nation's economic existence in order to \"preserve these [constitutional] rights and provide a foundation for their exercise,\" and claimed, \"that a person possess certain rights of free speech and assembly under the Constitution which must be observed, regardless of his political affiliations, no matter how strongly these political affiliations may be proved\". In an effort to utilize the federal government in defending civil liberties, La Follette introduced S.1970 inn an effort to remove the four oppressive labor practices noted during the investigation. The California investigations paved the way for the La Follette Committee's effort in fighting for American laborers with senate bills opposing oppressive labor practices.\n\nAt the start of the La Follett Committee's investigations, the Congress of Industrial Organizations launched its campaign to organize the mass production of the steel, automotive, and mining industries. By calling witnesses to the stand in an effort to expose American Industrial relations, the Committee supported the CIO, as both organizations strove to achieve a common goal of mass unionization. The ability of both organizations to operate in harmony allowed for their shared successes. When Myron Taylor of United States Steel publicly announced that his company would make a legal arrangement with the CIO, the La Follette Committee received wide spread acknowledgment and credit. Although it brought massive amounts of testimony which linked the succumbing of constitutional rights to anti-union policy, the findings of the La Follette Committee had already been previously noted by the Industrial Relations Commission's investigations predating World War I and the Interchurch World Movement analysis in 1919. Despite this, the Committee's success and notoriety exceeded previous investigative organizations because of its affiliations with the CIO. However, its continued existence was not guaranteed and its affiliations with a larger, more well known association, such as the CIO, was necessary for its accomplishments. Similarly, the CIO had no way of securing itself a victory over oppressive labor practices, and the mutually beneficial associations shared among the two organizations proved vital.\n\nThe La Follette Committee's handling of General Motors (GM) exemplifies the struggles of workers whose intent of organizing made the company infringe upon their civil liberties. With word of oppressive practices, most notably espionage, reaching the founders of the Committee before its official establishment, the decision to examine the events in Flint, Michigan, was a unanimous one. With intentions of bringing the tyrannical practices of the company to the attention of the public, the Committee obtained first hand reports of anti-union organizations in Flint. Reports obtained by the Committee also confirmed the involvement of local law enforcement, as they maintained their own espionage system set to infiltrate sit-down strikes in the state.\n\nThe La Follette Committee began its hearings of General Motors on February 15, with intentions of bolstering public opinion of the United Automobile Workers' (UAW) strikes (Auerbach 14). Accounts of spies infiltrating the UAW were disclosed at the hearing, as fifty-two members were reported as spies, relaying unionization efforts to those they worked for. Although word of the approval of the La Follette's investigation motivated the GM labor-relations director to hide all traces of the company's involvement with the union, mainly by erasing the evidence, the automobile company reported spending $839,764.41 in labor detective services, between 1934 and 1936. The hearings called for the testimony of rebellious spies and UAW organizers, such as Joseph B. Ditzel, to express their disapproval of GM labor policy and their negation of constitutional rights: \"[Ditzel] could not rent a hall in Saginaw to address the automobile workers; a gang of toughs in Bay City forcibly detained him in his hotel room; he was trailed constantly in Flint before his car was sideswiped and three organizers were sent to the hospital with serious injuries\". The Committee's hearings uncovered the expenses of GM's espionage, its scrutiny of labor policies, and its mistreatment of workers, which publicly demonstrated the injustices toward the union. Congressional disputes resulted from the hearings as the La Follette Committee found legal success with a resolution by Key Pittman of Nevada; referring to the findings of the Committee, Joseph Robinson added an amendment that rebuked any attempts at denying collective bargaining by employers and denounced their utilization of unfair labor practices. With the newly added amendment, a 75-3 vote approved the Pittman resolution by the Senate.\n\n"}

The building housed the CBS Radio Network's West Coast facilities, as well as CBS's original Los Angeles radio stations, KNX and KCBS-FM. KNXT-TV, Channel 2 (now KCBS-TV) moved into the complex in 1960, and the CBS Television Network's West Coast operations were based there until it moved to the larger CBS Television City in November 1952. After its purchase by CBS in 2002, KCAL-TV moved to the Square from studios adjacent to CBS's corporate sibling Paramount Pictures. Between 2004 and 2007 all of these operations moved to other facilities in the Los Angeles area.\n\nColumbia Square was built for KNX and as the Columbia Broadcasting System's West Coast operations headquarters on the site of the Nestor Film Company, Hollywood's first movie studio. The Christie Film Company eventually took over operation of Nestor Studios and filmed comedies on the site, originally the location of an early Hollywood roadhouse. Prior to moving to Columbia Square, KNX had been situated at several Hollywood locations.\n\nColumbia Square was designed by Swiss-born architect William Lescaze in the style of International Modernism and built over a year at a cost of two million dollars — more money than had ever been spent on a broadcasting facility.\n\nLescaze's sweeping streamline motifs, porthole windows and glass brick were true to Modernist design, though CBS President William Paley insisted the Square's form follow function. In his dedicatory speech, he remarked, \"It is because we believe these new Hollywood headquarters, reflecting many innovations of design and acoustics and control, will improve the art of broadcasting that we have built them and are dedicating them here tonight.\"\n\nColumbia Square opened April 30, 1938, with a full day of special broadcasts culminating in the star-studded evening special, \"A Salute to Columbia Square\" featuring Bob Hope, Al Jolson and Cecil B. DeMille. Crowds thronged Sunset Boulevard and a blimp bathed in searchlights hovered overhead as the program was carried coast-to-coast on the Columbia Broadcasting System, beamed to Europe via short wave, and carried across Canada on the CBC. On that premiere broadcast, Hope joked that Columbia Square looked like \"the Taj Mahal with a permanent wave.\" Jolson quipped, \"It looks like Flash Gordon's bathroom.\"\n\nThe Square's original configuration included eight studios. Studios 1 through 4 were to the left of the main entrance. Upstairs were Studios 5 through 7 and at the rear of the forecourt was the large auditorium referred to as the \"Columbia Playhouse\" that seated 1050. In 1940, two new audience theatres were added to the east of the auditorium called \"Studio B\" and \"Studio C\" each seating approximately 350 people. Shows such as Jack Benny's \"Lucky Strike Program\" and \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\" originated from Studio B. Lucille Ball's \"My Favorite Husband\", \"Blondie\", and \"Dr. Christian\" are a few of the shows that broadcast from Studio C. When B and C were built, the Columbia Playhouse then took the letter designation of \"Studio A\". Studio A was home to \"The Silver Theatre\", \"The Swan Show starring George Burns and Gracie Allen\", \"The Lady Esther Screen Guild Players\" and countless others. The complex included Brittingham's Radio Center Restaurant, a men's clothing store, and a branch of the Bank of America. Tours of the studios cost 40 cents and passed by a glass-windowed control room housing Columbia's West Coast master control.\n\n\"Columbia Square was one of the glories of radio. It was somewhat sacred to those in the industry. There was nothing comparable to its splendor in New York\" says writer-producer Norman Corwin whose most famous broadcast, \"On a Note of Triumph,\" originated from the Square on VE Day, 1945.\n\nIn early 2009, the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission and the City Council designated CBS Columbia Square Studios as a historic-cultural monument.\n\nColumbia Square became home to some of the best-known comedies of radio's golden age. Jack Benny, Burns and Allen, Edgar Bergen, Red Skelton, Eve Arden (\"Our Miss Brooks\"), Jack Oakie and Steve Allen sparked to the airways from the Square.\n\nDramas included \"Suspense\"; \"Gunsmoke\"; and \"Man Behind the Gun\", written, directed and produced by William N. Robson; \"Dr. Christian\", \"The Whistler\", \"Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\", \"The CBS Radio Workshop\", where author Aldous Huxley introduced a production of \"Brave New World\" and \"Columbia Presents Corwin\" — dramas produced by Norman Corwin.\n\nMusical acts that performed at Columbia Square included Eddie Cantor, Rosemary Clooney, Bing Crosby and Gene Autry. Composer Bernard Hermann frequently scored and conducted Columbia Square broadcasts. Through the facilities of KNX, the Columbia network broadcast big band music from nearby ballrooms including the Hollywood Palladium and the Earl Caroll Theater.\n\nWhen \"The Bing Crosby Show\" moved to CBS in 1949 it took over space on the second floor of the east side of Columbia Square. A tape recording and editing facility also was built there to support the show. It was first facility of its kind to support a national radio show. The recording sessions and the audience shows were usually held in the CBS theater at 1615 Vine Street just north of Hollywood Boulevard. With the new three recorder facility, the radio show evolved from a cut and splice operation into one that was created from many different recording sessions with audience reactions incorporated. It was new territory explored by the Crosby team.\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s Columbia Square also served as a CBS television facility. In 1948, the first West Coast-based variety program, \"The Ed Wynn Show\", was produced on Stage A. Lucille Ball's first national TV appearance took place on \"The Ed Wynn Show\" in December 1949 (aired on the East Coast just after New Year). Within the year Stage A would be the location of the shooting of the pilot episode of \"I Love Lucy\".\n\nIn the 2005 KNX broadcast, \"A Salute to Columbia Square\", announcer George Walsh recalled crowds jamming the Square's forecourt for tickets to live broadcasts. (Ushers would sometimes walk down Sunset Boulevard to NBC's studios at Vine Street to urge audience members to watch a Columbia Square broadcast instead.) After their on-air appearances, actors would dash to the Radio Actors Telephone Exchange in the Square's lobby to check with their agents about their next bookings.\n\nBob Crane was a top-rated KNX deejay at Columbia Square in the 1960s and James Dean worked as an usher. Some of the Square's once-luxurious radio theaters were converted to recording studios for Columbia Records where Bob Dylan, Barbra Streisand and many other top stars recorded albums.\n\nKNX moved into new studios in the Miracle Mile neighborhood on L.A.'s Wilshire Boulevard which it shares with Entercom Radio stations KFWB, KTWV, and KRTH. KNX, the last radio station to operate in Hollywood, moved after 67 years of operation at the Square just after 11:00 p.m. August 12, 2005, following a farewell broadcast from its Columbia Square studios. On April 21, 2007, KCBS-TV and KCAL-TV left the building and moved their operations to the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, thus ending Columbia Square's status as a broadcast facility, one of a very few remaining in Hollywood.\n\nThe Square fell into disrepair during the years in which Laurence Tisch chaired CBS, and asbestos problems were cited as a reason to demolish the venue. Sungow Corp acquired Columbia Square in 2003 for $15 million. Las Vegas-based developer Molasky Pacific LLC, acquired the property in August 2006 for $66 million. It planned to redevelop the complex to continue to attract entertainment industry tenants and is considering options that would add some residential units to the office and broadcasting facility. The project is valued at $850-million and is the largest development project in Hollywood, California. The redevelopment of the historic CBS Studios on Sunset was approved in 2009 with a controversial 28-story tower. Developer Kilroy Realty Group acquired the project in 2012 and changed plans — when completed the new Columbia Square will feature a 20-story residential tower with 200 apartments, of retail, three renovated historic structures, two new office buildings with an additional of space, and four and a half levels of underground parking. The development is currently under construction as of 2014.\n\nIn fall 2007, producer Viacom, owner of CBS until 2006, chose the site for MTV's \"\".\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation and Los Angeles Conservancy have been actively engaged in efforts to preserve the Hollywood landmark.\n\n\n"}

He lost his mother at age four, worked on his father's farm and went to school in the winter. Foss attended the Tilton Seminary, now Tilton School, before attending and graduating from Brown University in 1882. He would eventually be considered illustrious enough to warrant having his name inscribed on the mace. Beginning in 1898, he served as librarian at the Somerville Public Library in Massachusetts. He married a minister's daughter, with whom he had a daughter and son. Foss used to write a poem a day for the newspapers, and his five volumes of collected poetry are of the frank and homely “common man” variety.\n\nFoss is buried in the North Burial Ground in Providence, Rhode Island. He is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 114) along New Hampshire Route 43 in Candia.\n\nFor many years the opening lines from Foss's \"The Coming American\" (\"Bring me men to match my mountains / Bring me men to match my plains / Men with empires in their purpose / And new eras in their brains\") were inscribed on a granite wall at the United States Air Force Academy to inspire cadets and officers, but they were removed in 2003 to harmonize in perception to the Air Force Academy's having become coeducational. These words are currently engraved and displayed at Epcot in Orlando, Florida, and at the south end of the Jesse M. Unruh State Office Building in Sacramento, California. These opening lines are inscribed onto the Rocky Mountain Cup trophy, which is contested annually between Major League Soccer teams Real Salt Lake and Colorado Rapids.\n\nLongtime baseball announcer Ernie Harwell alluded to Foss's \"The House by the Side of the Road\" whenever he described a batter taking a called third strike: \"He stood there like the house by the side of the road and watched it go by.\"\n\nSinger Lamya's song \"Empires (Bring Me Men)\" takes most of its lyrics from \"The Coming American.\"\n\nA recitation of Foss's \"Two Gods\" provides the lyrics to the song \"A Greater God\" by MC 900 Ft.

{"id": "2163689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163689", "title": "The Backyardigans", "text": "The Backyardigans\n\nThe Backyardigans is a computer-animated musical children's TV series created by Janice Burgess. The series was written and recorded at Nickelodeon Animation Studio, with animation provided by Nelvana. It centers on a group of five anthropomorphic best friends who use their imaginations to embark on fantastic adventures in their shared backyard. Each episode is set to a different musical genre like reggae, country, or rock, and features at least four songs, written by various songwriters and performed by the characters with original dance choreography.\n\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot produced in 1998 titled \"Me and My Friends\". The pilot featured life-sized puppets who danced to songs on an indoor stage. In 2001, Nickelodeon's studio in New York retooled the concept into an animated pilot, using motion capture techniques to animate the dances. The newer pilot was greenlit, and the series entered production as a co-production between Nickelodeon and Nelvana. Nickelodeon called the show \"a home-grown Nick Jr. property,\" as \"the whole creative team... [had] been part of the Nick Jr. family for years.\"\n\nA total of 80 episodes were produced across four seasons, each containing 20 episodes. The series first previewed on Treehouse TV in Canada on September 11, 2004, followed by its official debut on Nickelodeon's Nick Jr. block on October 11, 2004. The fourth season wrapped production in 2010 and finished airing on Nick Jr. on July 12, 2013.\n\nEach episode follows a similar pattern and centers around a group of five friends: Uniqua, Pablo, Tyrone, Tasha, and Austin. The characters introduce themselves in their backyard before imagining a new location to enter. The group is often presented with multiple dilemmas along the way to accomplishing a certain goal or priority, or may be challenged with a major single obstacle to defeat or problem to solve. After season one, there is usually a villain in the episode, mainly played by one of the Backyardigans (thus another Backyardigan plays the role of the hero), but the villain of the episode always reforms in the end. The program also follows a musical format, featuring multiple musical numbers performed in the style of a different genre and sung throughout the course of an episode regarding whatever imaginary predicament in which the characters have situated themselves or perhaps a challenge that they have met, every episode opening and concluding with a particular song. The adventures get more advanced after the first season. When the Backyardigans have achieved their mission or defeated any disadvantages, the fantasy sequence fades, restoring actuality to the setting of the episodes as the closing song is sung, the characters scurrying to their houses for a snack. The main character or characters then opens the snack host's house door, fence, or around the corner, and shouts the main catchphrase for the last time and then closes the door. The picture then is lifeless with some background bird noises often heard as iris closes, ending the episode before the credits roll.\n\nEach of the five characters on the show have two voice actors: one for speaking, and the other for singing.\n\nThe dancing on the show is first performed by live-action dancers, and their movements are later transported to animation. Choreographer, Beth Bogush, describes the process: \"What we do is we film the live footage in the studio, send that off and they do a Leica, and then they send it to the animators. The animators watch, and were pretty precise. What we film for that day is pretty close to what you see in the character.\" In season one, the Backyardigans usually wear their normal clothes while on an adventure, usually accompanied with accessories. They rarely wear their normal clothes in an adventure after the first season.\n\n\n\nThe characters live in houses adjoining a large backyard common to the three central houses (Uniqua's, Pablo's, and Tyrone's) that is transformed by imagination into various adventure settings. Each house roughly corresponds to the color scheme of the character: Uniqua in a pink house, Pablo lives in a blue one, and Tyrone in an orange one. Tasha's house, which is to the left of the three central houses, is yellow and Austin's, to the right, is partially obscured by a fence but what is visible is purple. The fence, which surrounds the combined properties of the three main characters (Uniqua, Pablo, and Tyrone), has a gate in it which leads to Austin's house. The curve of the cul-de-sac allows the play area to be roughly equal in distance from each house's back door.\n\nNot everything that appears in the imaginary world has a real-world counterpart. Often trees, boulders, brickwork, or similar objects appear where nothing originally existed. By the same token, even large trees in the real garden disappear completely when the imagination part of the story commences.\n\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot titled \"Me and My Friends,\" produced at Nickelodeon Studios in September 1998. This pilot was rejected by Nickelodeon, and the concept was reworked into an animated short in 2002. This pilot was greenlit by Nickelodeon to become a full-length series. The show is intended for children aged 2 to 5.\n\nDave Palmer began directing the show in the middle of season one, and directed all subsequent episodes. Evan Lurie (of The Lounge Lizards) and Douglas Wieselman composed the music for the show with lyrics by McPaul Smith. The characters were designed by children's author and illustrator Dan Yaccarino.\n\nA second season was announced on April 30, 2006 by Nickelodeon and Nelvana. A third season was first released in the United States in January 2008. A fourth and final season was produced from 2009 to early 2010. The final season was aired sporadically in the United States, with the last four episodes airing as part of a special event in July 2013.\n\nSeveral \"The Backyardigans\" theatrical performances have toured Canada and the United States.\n\nIn Canada, three different performances have toured: \"Musical Playdate\" (2006), \"Quest for the Extra Ordinary Aliens\" (2008) and \"Sea Deep in Adventure\" (2009). The \"Musical Playdate\" performance had been promoted as \"V.I.P. Appearance\" and \"Backyardigans Mini Performance\" in earlier advertisements. All three tours were presented by Paquin Entertainment Group and produced by Koba Entertainment, both based in Winnipeg.\n\nIn the United States, two theatrical performances toured: 2008's \"Tale of the Mighty Knights\" and 2010's \"Storytime Live!\" (an event featuring four other Nick Jr. shows: \"Moose & Zee\", \"Dora the Explorer\", \"The Wonder Pets!\", and \"Ni Hao Kai-Lan\").\n\nParamount Home Media Distribution is the VHS and DVD distributor for the series in the US. In the United Kingdom, the show was distributed on DVD through Fremantle Home Entertainment.\n\nAll four seasons have been released on iTunes in Canada and the US; however, the US iTunes Store is missing three episodes from the first season: \"Secret Mission,\" \"It's Great to Be a Ghost!,\" and \"The Tea Party\" (also known as \"High Tea\").\n\nThere were four \"The Backyardigans\" albums released in North America, and one album released in Europe. Each has approximately 20 tracks, while \"Born To Play\" has four bonus tracks only available on the iTunes Store.\n\nReleased September 2004, this CD promoted the series' debut.

He died on 1 August 2014 from complications of a heart failure following major heart surgery. During the 1980s, he co-hosted BBC TV's Breakfast Time and was among rotating presenters of the music show Top of the Pops, broadcast on BBC One.\n\nSmith began his broadcasting career at Chelmsford Hospital Radio, before joining BBC Radio 1 in 1975 as a freelance producer and presenter. His work included promotions and production work for the \"Radio 1 Roadshow\", \"Quiz Kid\" and most daytime network shows. As a standby DJ, Smith occasionally broadcast when live outside broadcasts failed. He joined London's Capital Radio in June 1978 and presented a variety of shows until July 1980, when he became the breakfast show presenter. He moved back to BBC Radio 1 in 1982, presenting the weekday early show from 6 to 7 am and a Saturday-morning show.\n\nIn 1983, Smith took over the weekday lunchtime show from 11.30 am–2 pm until March 1984, when he briefly left to present \"BBC Breakfast Time\". He returned to Radio 1 in May 1986, taking over from Mike Read on \"The Radio 1 Breakfast Show\" from 7.00 to 9.30 am, where he remained until almost exactly two years later when he left Radio 1 for good in 1988. Smith admitted to Chris Moyles in a BBC documentary aired in May 2010, \"When Moyles met The Radio 1 Breakfast DJs\", he really missed being on the radio, but not television.\n\nSmith's career as a television presenter included Thames TV's \"CBTV\", BBC1 entertainment magazine and music chart shows \"Top of the Pops\" (1982-1988) \"Show Business\" (1983) and \"Friday's People\" (1985–87), Noel Edmonds' \"The Late, Late Breakfast Show\" (1984–86), \"That's Showbusiness\" (1989–96), and Julian Clary's \"Trick or Treat\" for ITV.\n\nSmith was one of BBC TV's presenters at Live Aid in 1985. He helped found Comic Relief and presented several of the charity's TV shows.\n\nSmith presented BBC TV's \"Railwatch\", which was broadcast live for five days in February 1989. Other large outside broadcasts included \"Hospital Watch\", \"Airport Watch\" and the BBC coverage of the Royal Tournament.\n\nSmith decided not to sign the licence extension that would allow the BBC to repeat the Top of the Pops episodes that he presented, with the BBC continuing to respect his wishes following his death. As a result, episodes featuring Smith have been omitted from the repeat run on BBC Four.\n\nSmith was a qualified helicopter pilot. He and his girlfriend (later his wife) Sarah Greene were injured on 10 September 1988 when the Robinson R22 Beta helicopter he was piloting (bearing the personal registration G-SMIF) crashed in Gloucestershire. Smith reported apparent unrecoverable loss of engine power whilst circling to reconnoitre an unfamiliar landing site. Both passengers survived, although Greene broke both legs and an arm, and Smith suffered a broken back and ankle. \n\nThe Air Accidents Investigation Branch neither criticised nor exonerated Smith in relation to the crash (it being beyond its remit to do so), concluding simply that \"examination of the helicopter [including flight control, fuel, engine control, dynamic systems and the engine itself] revealed no failure or unserviceability that could have resulted in a loss of rotor speed.\"\n\nIn 2004, Smith founded Flying TV – a company providing aerial filming services to broadcasters. As well as being Managing Director, Smith often acted as an aerial cameraman.\n\nDriving from the age of 8, Smith raced at the age of 14 in grasstrack events, building his own cars. In 1972, aged 17, he passed his test and took up motorsports in racing, rallying and rallycross. In 1976, he progressed to Formula Ford 2000 with the Patrick Head-designed Sark. Smith was also a motorsport commentator, mainly at Brands Hatch where he also, age 21, ran the marketing operation. It was through that during this time he became interested in broadcasting.\n\nWhile still broadcasting Smith raced in several British Touring Car Championship races as well, driving a newly homologated Sierra Cosworth in 1987, and then alongside Frank Sytner in 1988 with whom he often clashed in a BMW M3. He also won the Willhire 24 Hour at Snetterton in 1986, driving a Ford Escort RS Turbo. Veteran commentator Murray Walker remarked that Smith \"guaranteed action by the bucket-load\".\n\nIn 1989, Smith established a BTCC team known as Trakstar with Robb Gravett and Malcolm Swetnam. They ran two Sierra Cosworths, which had been imported from the Australian Touring Car stable of Dick Johnson.\nGravett went on to become runner up in Group A, but Smith struggled with his recovery from the helicopter crash. However, loss of a major sponsor in 1990 meant that only one car could be run, which was raced by Robb Gravett who became champion. Smith never raced competitively again.\n\nSmith attended Ballyholme Primary School in Bangor, Northern Ireland during the early 1960s due to his father being relocated to Belfast by his employer, the Ford Motor Company.\n\nHaving spent a short period at Bangor Grammar School, Smith attended King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford, where he was the resident DJ at the school Friday night sixth form disco. He married Sarah Greene in 1989, soon after their 1988 helicopter crash.\n\nSmith died on 1 August 2014 from complications following major heart surgery. His wife of 25 years, TV presenter Sarah Greene, survives him. Smith left more than £1 million from his personal estate to his wife.\n\n"}

The plot follows a college student who must make it from his campus in Los Angeles, California to his family's home in Larchmont, New York in time for Christmas dinner in order to win his father's Porsche. It stars Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Jessica Biel, Adam LaVorgna, Sean O'Bryan and Gary Cole and was released on November 13, 1998.\n\nJake Wilkinson (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), an 18-year-old attending the (fictional) Palisades College in California, has not been home to Larchmont, New York for any holidays since his mother died and his father remarried 10 months later. A few days before Christmas Eve, his father offers to give him his vintage 1957 Porsche 356 if he is home by 6:00 PM Christmas Eve for Christmas dinner. Initially, Jake had traded in his airline ticket to New York City for two tickets to Cabo San Lucas to take his girlfriend Allie Henderson (Jessica Biel), who is also from New York. When she declines, Jake reconsiders his father's deal and retrades the tickets back to New York. Allie agrees to ride with him.\n\nWith his trio of goons, Eddie Taffet (Adam LaVorgna), Jake's nemesis and rival for Allie's affections, leaves Jake in the desert dressed as Santa Claus to punish him for not getting an exam cheat sheet (a deal they had that Eddie secretly sabotaged on purpose). While Jake is stuck in the California desert, Eddie ends up giving a reluctant Allie a ride to New York after she thinks Jake bailed on her again.\n\nJake has only three days to get to Larchmont if he wants the car. He stumbles upon Nolan (Andrew Lauer), a simple-minded thief who is driving stolen kitchen goods to his dealer near New York. A police officer named Max (Sean O'Bryan) pulls them over in Red Cliff, Colorado for speeding, so Jake lies that Nolan is his elf, Snowpuff, and they're donating the goods to the children's hospital. The officer invites them to accompany him to North Platte, Nebraska to help him win back his wife Marjorie (Lesley Boone).\n\nMeanwhile, Allie convinces Eddie to stay the night at a novelty hotel in a Bavarian village, the Amana Colonies in Amana, Iowa. They are unknowingly standing beneath mistletoe when a news anchor is reporting live. Jake sees them kiss while he's waiting at the bus station in Nebraska and develops a scheme to convince the bus driver to drop him off at the Bavarian village. He obtains a cooler and a slab of meat, writes Allie's name and address on the cooler, and convinces the whole busload that the cooler needs to be delivered to a little girl at the hospital in the Bavarian village for a transplant.\n\nAfter Allie lets Jake into her and Eddie's room, Eddie walks out of the shower only clad in a towel and Jake assumes he and Allie have slept together. Jake and Allie make up until Jake blurts out that Eddie prevented him from getting home by 6 PM. Upset that Jake cares more about the car than about her, Allie storms onto the bus and takes Jake's seat.\n\nJake and Eddie drive off. Eddie suddenly becomes jealous realizing that Jake will get Allie \"and\" the Porsche if he makes it home, and throws Jake out of his car somewhere in Wisconsin. Jake decides to enter a Santa Claus race for a chance to win the $1,000 prize to buy an airline ticket to New York. Eddie is arrested after insulting (and possibly doing more) two policemen dressed as Christmas trees patrolling the race. While registering for the race, Jake meets a nice man named Jeff Wilson, whom he barely beats in the race. But en route to the airport, the taxi driver informs Jake that Jeff is actually the mayor of the town; he usually wins the race every year and uses the prize money to buy food for the impoverished. Jake feels bad and gives the money to the Mayor.\n\nJake talks to his sister, who arranges for an airline ticket for him from Madison, Wisconsin. The airline doesn't let him board because he has no photographic identification, so he stows away in a dog kennel on a cargo aircraft with a large dog named Ringo. From the airport he hides on a train, tries to hitch a ride in a car, then steals a one-horse open sleigh from the local parade. When he reaches his street, he apologizes to Allie and they make up. Jake rides the sleigh home, arrives at 5:59 PM, and intentionally waits a few minutes to go inside so he isn't in time to get the Porsche. When his father offers it to him anyway, he refuses. He also finally accepts his stepmother. The Wilkinsons and Allie get into the sleigh just as the parade arrives and join the procession.\n\n\n\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" made $3.9 million in its opening weekend, finishing at 6th at the box office. At the end of its run, the film grossed $12 million, against its $30 million budget, making it a box office bomb.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 23% based on 43 reviews, with an average rating of 4/10. The site's critical consensus says that \"Neither parent nor child will find any merriment in this mess.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film 1/4 stars and described the film as \"Pleasantville\" made from \"anti-matter\", saying the film is about \"People who seem to be removed from a '50's sit-com so they can spread cliches, ancient jokes, dumb plotting and empty cheerful sanitized gimmicks into our world and time.\" Christopher Null called the film \"surprisingly engaging\" and gave it 3 out of 5 stars.\n\n"}

It lies along former U.S. Route 66 (now a county road west of the junction of Route 266 and Route 96), four miles (6 km) west of Halltown. Paris Springs Junction started as a few businesses on Route 66 and, with the decommissioning of that highway, has now become only homes. It was so named because of a former town named Paris Springs to the north. That town was founded in 1855 and survived until the time of Route 66's decommissioning.\n\nParis Springs is located on Section 29 in Ozark Township at . The settlement was first known as Johnson's Mills. Clover Creek was used in the 1850s by the firm of Cherry & Johnson, J.R. Johnson and W.F. Likens for mill power, and turned out flour and meal from each of their mills. The mill distributed their products over a large trade area.\n\nLater there was O.P. Johnson's saw mill and woolen mill, also E.L. Davis chair factory. In the 1880s O.P. Johnson was postmaster. Paris Springs was a popular resort in the early part of the 1900s.

STCW was adopted in 1978 by conference at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London, and entered into force in 1984. The Convention was significantly amended in 1995.\nThe 1978 STCW Convention was the first to establish minimum basic requirements on training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers on an international level. Previously the minimum standards of training, certification and watchkeeping of officers and ratings were established by individual governments, usually without reference to practices in other countries. As a result, minimum standards and procedures varied widely, even though shipping is extremely international by nature.\n\nThe Convention prescribes minimum standards relating to training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers which countries are obliged to meet or exceed.\n\nThe Convention did not deal with manning levels: IMO provisions in this area are covered by regulation 14 of Chapter V of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974, whose requirements are backed up by resolution A.890(21) Principles of safe manning, adopted by the IMO Assembly in 1999, which replaced an earlier resolution A.481(XII) adopted in 1981 and has since been itself replaced by resolution A.1047(27) Principles of Minimum Safe Manning, adopted by the IMO Assembly in 2011.\n\nOne especially important feature of the Convention is that it applies to ships of non-party States when visiting ports of States which are Parties to the Convention. Article X requires Parties to apply the control measures to ships of all flags to the extent necessary to ensure that no more favourable treatment is given to ships entitled to fly the flag of a State which is not a Party than is given to ships entitled to fly the flag of a State that is a Party.\n\nThe difficulties which could arise for ships of States which are not Parties to the Convention is one reason why the Convention has received such wide acceptance. By 2018, the STCW Convention had 164 Parties, representing 99.2 per cent of world shipping tonnage.\n\nOn 7 July 1995, the IMO adopted a comprehensive revision of STCW. It also included a proposal to develop a new STCW Code, which would contain the technical details associated with provisions of the Convention. The amendments entered force on 1 February 1997. Full implementation was required by 1 February 2002. Mariners already holding certification had the option to renew the certificates in accordance with the old rules of the \"1978 Convention\" during the period ending on 1 February 2002. Mariners entering training programs after 1 August 1998 are required to meet the competency standards of the new \"1995 Amendments\".\n\nThe most significant amendments concerned:\n\nThe IMO Convention on Standards of Training Certification and Watchkeeping of Seafarers adopted a new set of amendments in Manila in 2010 called \"The Manila Amendments\". These amendments were necessary to keep training standards in line with new technological and operational requirements that require new shipboard competencies. The Manila Amendments were effective as of 1 January 2012. There is a transition period until 2017 when all seafarers must be certified and trained according to the new standards. Implementation is progressive, every year a modified set of requirements comes into force. The most significant amendments are:\n\nOn 7 July 1995, the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel was adopted as a separate treaty as part of the comprehensive revisions to STCW. It applies the principles of STCW to fishing vessels from ratifying states that are 24 metres in length and above. STCW-F came into force on 29 September 2012.\n\n\n"}

He is the Club Santos Laguna top goal scorer with 205 goals. A prolific goal scorer at club and national levels, Borgetti was renowned for his heading ability. He is popularly known by the nickname of \"El Zorro del Desierto\" (\"The Desert Fox\") in reference to his debut professional team and his birthplace.\n\nJared Borgetti’s best known goal was scored against Italy in the 2002 FIFA World Cup. At the 34th minute, Cuauhtémoc Blanco crosses the ball into the box and Borgetti scored an unforgettable goal by jumping back and turning his head. This world-class goal was ranked as one of the best goals of the 2002 World Cup and is still remembered today. \n\nHe currently works for ESPN Deportes and ESPN Mexico as a commentator for Santos Laguna matches and as an analyst for the show \"Fútbol Picante\".\n\nBorgetti began his young career with Atlas in the Primera División de México on 6 March 1994, debuting in a 3–1 loss over Club América. After two successful seasons, he signed with Santos Laguna, where he claimed three golden boot titles for most goals in the season in his seven-year participation with club. With Santos, he won two league championships. Borgetti later signed a one-year contract with promoted team Dorados de Sinaloa, where he stated he wanted to play in his home team, before joining Pachuca, at the latter where he had little activity due to the qualifying games for the World Cup.\n\nOn 4 August 2005, Borgetti signed a two-year deal with English club Bolton Wanderers for a fee of around £1 million. He became the first Mexican to play for an English club.\n\nHe made his official English debut in a 2–0 Premier League win over Newcastle United twenty days after signing, and scored his first goal for the club during Bolton's UEFA Cup tie against Lokomotiv Plovdiv on 15 September, scoring again in the competition against Besiktas on 20 October. He went on to score in the FA Cup against Watford and in the League Cup against West Ham and Leicester City. Having also scored two league goals against Manchester City and Charlton Athletic, Borgetti ended the season with seven goals in all competitions.\n\nAfter the 2005–06 season, Borgetti was released by Bolton. He eventually signed with Saudi Arabian club Al-Ittihad. He made his debut on 9 September 2006, scoring two goals in a 3–2 victory over Saudi team Al-Ta'ee. In December 2006, Borgetti left Al-Ittihad. Teams from the leagues of France, England, and Spain showed interest in signing the player.\n\nIn mid-December 2006, Santos Laguna showed interest in signing Borgetti and Francisco Fonseca, but unfortunately, days later, Club América signed Vicente Matias Vuoso on loan to Santos. Borgetti and Fonseca turned down the club's offer and later announced that he would return to Mexico as a member of Cruz Azul under a one-year contract. In 2007, Borgetti was called upon by Hugo Sánchez to represent Mexico in a series of international friendly matches and tournaments. His jersey number was 58.\n\nOn 21 December 2007, it was officially announced that Borgetti would play for Monterrey for the next six months in the Mexico Clausura 2008 tournament. Borgetti scored his first goal with the \"Rayados\" in the \"Clásico Regiomontano\" against UANL Tigres, where Tigres won 3–2.\n\nStarting on 14 January 2009, Borgetti played for Guadalajara for six months. He was brought especially to play in the 2009 Copa Libertadores. He always stated that he had accomplished one of his dreams as a footballer, to be on a team where all of the players were Mexican-born and to be on a team with the most championships in the Primera División. Borgetti played seven games in the Torneo Clausura 2009 as a starter and six as a sub, barely recording 220 minutes for the club. In the Copa Libertadores, he played six out of the six games, three as a starter and three as a sub, playing a total of 366 minutes. Shortly after the season ended Borgetti was let go along with other newly recruited teammates due to the club's disappointing season.\n\nSince his departure from Guadalajara, Borgetti has gone on to sign with Puebla as of 13 June 2009 in time for the Apertura 2009 Tournament. In a pre-season game, Borgetti suffered a broken ribcage and had to sit out for the first four weeks of the Apertura Tournament. He scored his first goal on 9 August 2009 against Querétaro. He continued his good form by scoring a header on 22 August 2009, in a 2–1 win against Pachuca. At the end of the season Borgetti left the club to pursue another team. He decided to go back to Mexico with his family and friends.\n\nOn 27 December 2009 signed a one-year contract with Monarcas Morelia. On 13 February 2010 he scored his first goal with Monarcas Morelia and 249th in Mexico league soccer. That same goal tied him for 3rd top goal scorer in Mexico league history with José Saturnino Cardozo. On 24 April 2010, he scored his 250th goal, giving him the sole possession of the 3rd position in the top goal scorers of the Mexico League, passing Jose Cardozo who played for Toluca and scored 249 goals.\n\nAfter his departure from Morelia, Borgetti was considering retirement, but after getting an agreement with Club León, he played for the team in Mexico's Liga de Ascenso in the fall of 2010. After failing to make it to the play-offs he was released from his contract. On 5 December 2010, he announced his retirement from professional football.\n\nOn the international stage, Borgetti first played with Mexico on 5 February 1997 against Ecuador. He would not make his mark internationally, however, until the qualification campaign for the 2002 FIFA World Cup began in late 2000. After the qualification campaign proved successful for Mexico, Borgetti became a regular starter within the squad and went on to score goals for his country at the 2001 Copa América, the 2002 World Cup, and the 2004 Copa América.\n\nBorgetti's most successful tournament was the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup. He scored three goals against Brazil and Germany and helped Mexico to a fourth-place finish. He also had to retake a penalty twice against Brazil due to various infractions. It was blocked on the third attempt, but he later scored the winning goal that resulted in a 1–0 upset.\n\nOn 25 March 2007, Borgetti came off the bench, replacing Omar Bravo in a match against Paraguay. Borgetti scored two goals within three minutes. On 8 June 2007, Borgetti played in the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup, scoring two goals. He also scored a goal in the quarter-finals against Costa Rica. In the final against the United States, Borgetti injured himself, and could not participate in the 2007 Copa América, where the Mexico national team reached the third place in the Competition against Brazil and Argentina, beating Uruguay in the third place game of the Copa América.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This projects the scene on the ground glass upside down. The photographer focuses and composes using this projected image, sometimes with the aid of a magnifying glass (or loupe). In order to see the image better, a dark cloth is used to block out light, whence came the image of the old-time photographer with his head stuck under a large black cloth.\n\nA ground glass is also used in the reflex finder of an SLR or TLR camera.\n\nIn motion-picture cameras, the ground glass is a small, usually removable piece of transparent glass that sits between the rotary disc shutter and the viewfinder. The ground glass usually contains precise markings to show the camera operator the boundaries of the frame or the center reticle, or any other important information. Because the ground glass is positioned between the mirror shutter and the viewfinder, it does not interfere with the image reaching the film and is therefore not recorded over the final image, but rather serves as a reference for the camera operator.\n\nGround glasses commonly serve as a framing reference for a desired aspect ratio. Because most films shot with spherical lenses are shot full-frame and later masked during projection to a more widescreen aspect ratio, it is important not only for the operator to be able to see the boundaries of that aspect ratio, but also for the ground glass to be properly aligned in the camera so that the markings are an exact representation of the boundaries of the image recorded on film.\n\nGround or frosted glass is widely used as a weather- and heat-proof light diffuser in ambient lighting, namely on glass covers or enclosures for lamp fixtures, and sometimes on incandescent bulbs. Its functions include reducing glare and preventing retinal damage by direct sight of the lamp filament. This hides unsightly details of the lamp and fixture without blocking its light, yielding a softer illumination without giving hard shadows.\n\nGround glass surfaces are often found on the glass equipment of chemical laboratories.\n\nGlass flasks, stoppers, valves, funnels, and tubing are often connected together by ground glass joints, matching pairs of conical or spherical surfaces that have been ground to a precise shape.\n\nFlasks and test tubes often have a small ground-glass label area on the side. (Pencil writing on ground glass is largely inert, rub-proof and waterproof, but can be easily erased.)\n\nAn optical microscope may include a ground- or frosted-glass diffuser to evenly illuminate the field behind the specimen. Microscope slides are often ground on the sides and beveled on the corners to soften the edges for safer handling.\n\nPopular belief for many centuries is that ground-up glass (i.e., glass broken into tiny fragments) can kill if swallowed. In fact, this is a myth, as it is largely ineffective.\n\nThe Guy de Maupassant short story \"\"La Confession\"\" concerns a jealous girl who poisons her older sister's suitor by inserting ground-up glass into cake.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2163726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163726", "title": "Oriflamme", "text": "Oriflamme\n\nThe Oriflamme (from Latin \"aurea flamma\", \"golden flame\") was the battle standard of the King of France in the Middle Ages. It was originally the sacred banner of the Abbey of St. Denis, a monastery near Paris. When the oriflamme was raised in battle by the French royalty during the Middle Ages, most notably during the Hundred Years War, no prisoners were to be taken until it was lowered. Through this tactic they hoped to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy, especially the nobles, who could usually expect to be taken alive for ransom during such military encounters.\n\nIn French, the term \"\"oriflamme\"\" has come to mean any banner with pointed ends, by association with the form of the original.\n\nThe Oriflamme was mentioned in the eleventh-century ballad the \"Chanson de Roland\" (vv. 3093-5) as a royal banner, first called \"Romaine\" and then \"Montjoie\". According to legend, Charlemagne carried it to the Holy Land in response to a prophecy regarding a knight possessing a golden lance, from which flames would burn and drive out the Saracens. This suggests that the \"lance\" was originally the important object, with the banner simply a decoration, but this changed over time.\n\nThe Oriflamme was first used by Louis VI in 1124 and was last flown in battle at Agincourt in 1415, though a version of it remained in the Abbey of St. Denis until the 18th century.\n\nLouis VI replaced the earlier banner of Saint Martin with the oriflamme of the Abbey of St. Denis, which floated about the tomb of St. Denis and was said to have been given to the abbey by king Dagobert.\nUntil the 12th century the standard-bearer was the Comte de Vexin, who, as vowed to St. Denis, was the temporal defender of the abbey. Louis VI, having acquired Vexin, became standard-bearer; as soon as war began, Louis VI received Communion at St. Denis and took the standard from the tomb of the saint to carry it to the combat.\n\nIt is recorded as having been carried at the following battles/campaigns:\n\nThe Oriflamme was lost at least five times during its medieval history; Mons-en-Pévèle, Crécy, Poitiers, and Agincourt, and also during the campaigns of the Seventh Crusade under King Louis IX.\n\nThe banner was red or orange-red silk and flown from a gilded lance. According to legend, its colour stems from it being dipped in the blood of the recently beheaded St. Denis.\n\nThe surviving descriptions of the Oriflamme are in Guillaume le Breton (thirteenth century), in the \"Chronicle of Flanders\" (fourteenth century), in the \"Registra Delphinalia\" (1456) and in the inventory of the treasury of St. Denis (1536). They show that the primitive Oriflamme was succeeded in the course of the centuries by newer Oriflammes which bore little resemblance to one another except for their colour.\n\nWhen the Oriflamme was displayed on the battlefield it indicated that no quarter\nwas to be given, its red colour being symbolic of cruelty and ferocity.\n\nAlthough the azure ground (from the blue cope of St. Martin of Tours) strewn with gold fleur-de-lis remained the symbol of royalty until the 15th century, the Oriflamme became the royal battle standard of the King of France, and it was carried at the head of the king's forces when they met another army in battle. In the fifteenth century, the fleur-de-lis on the white flag of Joan of Arc became the new royal standard replacing both the symbol of royalty and the Oriflamme on the battle field.\n\nThe bearer of the standard, the \"porte-oriflamme\", became an office (like that of Marshal or Constable) and a great honour, as it was an important and very dangerous job to take charge of such a visible symbol in battle. If things went badly, the bearer was expected to die rather than relinquish his charge.\n\nFroissart vividly describes \"porte-oriflamme\" Geoffroi de Charny's fall at the side of his king at the Battle of Poitiers in this passage: \n\nThere Sir Geoffroi de Charny fought gallantly near the king (note: and his fourteen-year-old son). The whole press and cry of battle were upon him because he was carrying the king’s sovereign banner [the Oriflamme]. He also had before him his own banner, gules, three escutcheons argent. So many English and Gascons came around him from all sides that they cracked open the king’s battle formation and smashed it; there were so many English and Gascons that at least five of these men at arms attacked one [French] gentleman. Sir Geoffroi de Charny was killed with the banner of France in his hand, as other French banners fell to earth.\n\n\nIn canto XXXI of \"Paradiso\", Dante describes the Virgin Mary in the Empyrean as \"pacifica oriafiamma\" (Musa's translation, \"oriflame of peace\")\nThe 19th-century poet Robert Southey refers to the Oriflamme and its reputation in his poem \"Joan of Arc\"\n\nThe 20th-century Martiniquais poet and politician, Aimé Césaire (1913-2008) invokes the Oriflamme in his poem \"Your Hair\" (\"Chevelure\"). By invoking the Oriflamme, Césaire also invokes the French Colonial Empire, war, and oppression. The poem is included in \"The Collected Poetry of Aimé Césaire.\" An excerpt reads: \n"}

Laurel & Hardy retaliate by damaging the man's doorframe with a knife. Finlayson then goes to work on their clothes, and this escalates, with his home and their car being destroyed in the melee (after Finlayson has run out of Christmas trees to mangle).

Ali is revered by Sunni Muslims as the fourth Rightly Guided Caliphs, and as a foremost religious authority on the Qur'an and \"Fiqh\" (Islamic jurisprudence). Shi'a Muslims consider him the First Imam appointed by the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the first rightful caliph. Ali was the cousin of Muhammad, and after marriage to Fatimah he also became Muhammad's son-in-law. His descendants through Fatimah are revered today in Shia Islam as Imams, Sharifs or Sayyids.\n\nHis father was Abu Talib and his mother was Fatima bint Asad, but he was raised in the household of Muhammad, who himself was raised by Abu Talib, Muhammad's uncle. When Muhammad reported receiving a divine revelation, Ali was the first child to accept his message and first to convert to Islam at the age of 12, dedicating his life to the cause of Islam.\n\nIn Muslim culture, Ali is respected for his courage, knowledge, belief, honesty to Islam, deep loyalty to Muhammad, equal treatment of all Muslims and generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies, and therefore is central to mystical traditions in Islam such as Sufism. Ali retains his stature as an authority on Quranic exegesis, Islamic jurisprudence and religious thought. Ali holds a high position in almost all Sufi orders which trace their lineage through him to Muhammad. Ali's influence has been important throughout Islamic history.\n\nThe Sayyid Aljabery family of southern Iraq are descendants of Ali from his son Imam Husayn. The Bukhari of Pakistan are Syed descendends of Ali, and includes 9 of the 12 Shia imams. The Idrisid and Alaouite dynasties of Morocco claim to be descended from Ali and Fatimah. The descendants of Ali include the Hashemite royal families of Jordan \"some Somali claim that they are direct descendants\", the Husseini family of Lebanon, the Hiraki family of Syria and Egypt, the Alaouite royal family of Morocco and the Ashrafs of the city of Harar, Mashwanis and Alvi Awan families of Pashtuns in Pakistan. Other prominent descendants include: Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya, Abdullah al-Aftah ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq, Ali al-Uraidhi ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq, Muhammad ibn Qasim (al-Alawi), Muhammad ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq (Al-Dibaj), Yahya ibn Umar, Muhammad ibn Ali al-Hadi and Ibn Dihya al-Kalby.\n\nThis is a simplified family tree of Husayn ibn Ali. People in \"italics\" are considered by the majority of Shia and Sunni Muslims to be \"Ahl al-Bayt\" (\"People of the House\").

Some believe the first part \"Ananda Lahari\" was etched on mount Meru by Ganesha himself (or by Pushpadanta). Sage Gaudapada, the teacher of Shankar's teacher Govinda Bhagavadpada, memorised the writings of Pushpadanta which was carried down to Adi Shankara.\nIts hundred and three shlokas (verses) eulogize the beauty, grace and munificence of Goddess Parvati / Dakshayani, consort of Shiva. W. Norman Brown translated it to English which was published as volume 43 of the Harvard Oriental Series in 1958.\n\nThe \"Saundarya Lahari\" is not only the collection of holy hymns, but also a tantra textbook, giving instructions Puja on Sri-Yantra and worshiping methods, 100 different hymns, 100 different yantra, almost one to each shloka; describes the appropriate tantra method of performing devotion connected to each specific shloka; and details the results ensuring therefrom. There are many interpretations and commentaries but best of these are arguably those that provide word-to-word translations, as also the yantra, the devotion to be performed and the results of the devotion.\n\nIt is once said that Adi Shankara visited Kailash to worship Shiva and Parvati. There, the Lord gave him a manuscript containing 100 verses which described the many facets of the Goddess, as a gift to him. While Shankara was returning after visiting Kailash, Nandi stopped him on the way. He snatched the manuscript from him, tore it into two, took one part and gave the other to Shankara. Shankara, desolate, ran to Shiva and narrated the incident to him. Shiva, smiling, commanded him to retain the 41 verses with him as the initial part of the 100 verses and then, write an extra 59 verses in praise of the Goddess himself. Thus, verses 1 - 41 are the original work of Lord Shiva, shedding great light on the ancient rituals of Tantra, Yantra and various powerful Mantra.\nVerses 1 - 41 describe the mystical experience of the union of Shiva and Shakti and related phenomena. In fact, it opens with the assertion that Only when Shiva is united with Shakti does he have the power to create. \n\nThe remaining verses, i.e. 42-100 are composed by Adi Shankara himself, which mainly focuses on the appearance of the Goddess. All the 100 verses are collectively known as 'Soundarya Lahari'.\nThe Soundarya Lahari is not only a poem. It is a tantra textbook, giving instructions on Puja and offerings, many yantra, almost one to each shloka; describing the tantra technique of performing devotion connected to each specific shloka; and details the results ensuing therefrom. There are many interpretations and commentaries but best of these are arguably those that provide word-to-word translations, as also the yantra, the devotion to be performed and the results of the devotion.\n\nVerses 42 100 are more straightforward; they describe the physical beauty of the Goddess and are sometimes referred to as the Soundarya Lahari itself.\n\nMany scholars, however, refer to the entire text with one name, namely, Soundarya Lahari.\n\nFirst 41 verses cover the detailed account of internal worship of the Mother. It consists of systematic exposition of the concept of kundalini, Sri Chakra, mantra (verses 32, 33). This depicts the Supreme Reality as non-dual but with a distinction between Shiva and Shakti, the power holder and Power, Being and Will. The Power, that is, the Mother or Maha Tripura Sundari, becomes the dominant factor and the power holder or Shiva becomes a substratum. The first verse itself clearly describes this idea. \"United with Shakti, Shiva is endowed with power to create; or otherwise, he is incapable of even a movement.\" The same idea is brought out in verse 24, \"Brahma creates the universe, Vishnu sustains, Rudra destroys, and Maheshwar absorbs every thing and assimilates into Sadashiva. On receiving mandate from thy creeper like brows, Sadasiva restores everything into activity as in the previous cycle.\" Such dominance of the Mother can be seen in verses 34 and 35 also.\n\nThere are several legends about this work. One legend says that, once Adi Shankara visited Kailash to worship Shiva and Parvati. There, the Lord gave him a manuscript containing 100 verses which described the many facets of the Goddess, as a gift to him. While Shankara was returning after visiting Kailash, Nandi stopped him on the way. He snatched the manuscript from him, tore it into two, took one part and gave the other to Shankara. Shankara, desolate, ran to Shiva and narrated the incident to him. Shiva, smilingly, commanded him to retain the 41 verses with him as the initial part of the 100 verses and then, write an extra 59 verses in praise of the Goddess himself. Thus, verses 1 - 41 are the original work of Lord Shiva, shedding great light on the ancient rituals of Tantra, Yantra and various powerful Mantra. The remaining verses, i.e. 42-100 are composed by Adi Shankara himself, which mainly focuses on the appearance of the Goddess. Yet another legend says that once when Adi Shankara was visiting Kailash, Lord Shiva was writing about the beauty of Goddess Parvati on the walls of their home. Shiva rubbed what he wrote as he didn't want Adi Shankara who was an outsider reading about the beauty of his wife. But Adi Shankara had seen some part of the writings and with his superior mind recollected the rest. Thus, he composed the Soundarya Lahari(waves of beauty of the Devi).\n\nThere are more than 36 commentaries on the Soundarya Lahari in Sanskrit itself. Among the better known are commentaries by Lakshmidhara, Kameshvarasuri (viz. Arunamodini), Kaivalyashrama (viz. Sowbagyavardhini) and Dindima.\n\nThere are many English translations with commentaries on Soundarya Lahari done by various authors.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1996 by Jamie Hyneman, it specialized in producing props for movies and television. It is now a research and development firm.\n\nIn 1996, Jamie Hyneman took over the Colossal Pictures workshop, using it to establish M5 Industries. The company originally produced special effects props for film, including animatronic puppets, such as those seen in \"James and the Giant Peach\" and \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\". M5 Industries has produced special effects for many commercials, such as a motorized 7 Up soft drink vending machine that shoots soda cans at people and a remote-controlled shoe for Nike.\n\nThe facilities were used extensively for the production of the television show \"MythBusters\", with the M5 Industries workshop used as the primary shooting location for the first season. During the second season, when a second team of MythBusters was introduced, a second space located at 2200 Jerrold Avenue in San Francisco, dubbed \"M6\" was leased for them. Many of the people who appear on \"MythBusters\" were originally employees of M5, notably Kari Byron.\n\nSince the end of production for Mythbusters, the company no longer does special effects for movies and television, now focusing on research and development. The workshop does not offer tours or allow visits from the public because of insurance issues.\n\nThe company's name was suggested by Adam Savage. He intended to suggest the name of either the branch of the British secret service which built gadgets in James Bond fiction (Q Branch) or British secret service itself (MI6), but was mistaken as to the correct name, and suggested M5. Savage alleges that Hyneman never paid him the promised $50 prize for having his suggestion selected.\n\nGrant Imahara also explained that he asked Jamie Hyneman what the \"M\" stood for in M5 to which he replied \"Movies, Monsters, Mechanics, Machining...\" and Imahara was thinking that the final M comically stood for Mustache. M5 Industries website from 2000 says \"M5 stands for Models, Machines, Miniatures, Manufacturing... and yes, at least a little bit of Magic.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2163756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163756", "title": "Sprint (word processor)", "text": "Sprint (word processor)\n\nSprint is a text-based word processor for MS-DOS, first published by Borland in 1987.\n\nSprint originally appeared as the \"FinalWord\" application, developed by Jason Linhart, Craig Finseth, Scott Layson Burson, Brian Hess, and Bill Spitzak at Mark of the Unicorn - a company (headquartered in Cambridge, MA) which is now better known for its music software products. At the time MOTU sold MINCE and SCRIBBLE, a text editor package based on Emacs. As The FinalWord, the package met with some success: for example, the manuals of the Lotus software package were written on it, as was Marvin Minsky's book The Society of Mind.\n\nFinalWord II was renamed Sprint when it was acquired by Borland, which added a new user interface, new manuals, and features to the application. The editor speed was considered blazing at the time, running with no delays on machines as slow as 8 megahertz.\n\nThis was the time of European development for Borland: Sidekick and Turbo Pascal had been founded in Denmark; and the management of the European subsidiary comprised former Micropro France managers (Micropro was at the time the world leader in Word processing software with the famous WordStar line-up. They had success with the launch of WordStar 2000 - the first word processor package with a spelling dictionary in French.)\n\nThis is why the development and marketing of the product was conducted in France. Sprint is one of the very few major products from an American software publisher that had a French version shipped before the American version.\n\nSprint v1.0 shipped in France with notable initial success, capturing a 30 percent market share and getting the jump on competing word processors. MicroPro was weakening with old Wordstar products and still-new WordStar 2000; WordPerfect was having problems with the translation and the user interface; and MS-Word was a decent but less polished or powerful product, and was also DOS and text-based.\n\nThe lack of beta-test combined with pressure to ship for back-to-school time resulted in a Sprint 1.0 which had a number of minor glitches and bugs that had to be corrected with version 1.01 and a whole new set of diskettes for every single registered user.\n\nVersion 1.0 (equivalent of French 1.01) shipped a few months later in the US and rest of world, with a mixed reception from customers. Traditional Borland fans who bought Sprint were happy with the editor, but wondered why the package included a sophisticated formatter, while business users who wanted a word processor just to write their memos and letters wondered what to do with the heavy manual and powerful features of the formatter language. In any event, word processing was shifting to WYSIWYG.\n\nVersion 1.5 did ship with a number of new features and real stability in France, but never made it elsewhere, although a number of localized versions had been built for various European countries. At this time, Borland Scandinavia had gone bankrupt, while Borland France had to be saved by massive financial help from the US. The developers who once worked in Europe had to move to the Scotts Valley CA premises. Version 1.5 was a reasonable success in France for some years, but Microsoft Word and Windows gained momentum and obscured all the other products.\n\nIn North America, Sprint never really gained traction in the marketplace, as it was overshadowed by WordPerfect and then Microsoft Word. It built up a small, but loyal and often enthusiastic, following among professional writers, researchers, academics, and programmers who appreciated its power, speed, and ability to handle large documents. Borland did not believe that there was enough of a market to warrant updating the product, and it eventually stopped supporting it.\n\nCrash-recovery: Sprint had incremental back-up, with its swap file updated every 3 seconds, enabling full recovery from crashes. At trade shows, demos were made with one person pulling out the power cord, and the typist resuming work as soon as the machine restarted.\n\nSpell-as-you-type: With this feature, Sprint could beep at you in real time when detecting a typo.\n\nMultilingual editing: Sprint included dictionary switching, support for hyphenation, and spelling and thesaurus dictionaries that have yet to be matched by the competitors.\n\nSeparate formatter and programmable editor: These have been useful features for corporate environments aiming at standardizing documents or building \"boilerplate\" contracts. In France, for example, applications were built for Banques Populaires (loan contracts) or Conseil d'Etat, while some local government agencies created specific applications for tenders and contracts.\n\nPowerful programming language: Programming in Sprint was done with the internal language of the word processor - a language that is much like C. Programmers have the ability to \"get under the hood\" and add modifications and extensions to an extent not possible with other word processors. Once written, Sprint programs are compiled into the interface, and run at full speed.\n\nInterface switching: Modifications and extensions to Sprint can be saved into separate interfaces which can be easily and quickly switched. This is useful for people working in different languages, as the keys can be mapped to the accents and characters of each language, depending on the interface.\n\nFile handling: Users could work in up to 24 files at once. All open files could be saved on exit or not—and nevertheless automatically reopened as left, including each file's cursor position, cut and paste buffer contents, and spell check status. Because this behavior was accomplished using the crash-recovery swap file (see above), it allowed an \"instant-on\" behavior using the saved state from the previous run; this was unusual for its time.\n\nHandling large documents: Sprint has the ability to publish large documents (hundreds of pages) with strict formatting consistency and automatic table of contents, index generation, tables of figures, and tables of authorities. These features made Sprint a leader in the production of technical documents - and Borland itself did all its manuals on Sprint, for years.\n\nPostScript capabilities: Sprint could print in-line EPS images with dimensioning, and also had the ability to add in-line PostScript procedures. This made the product rather popular in the printing industry. For example, making a 200-page novel fit into 192 pages was simply a matter of changing the point size from 11 to 10.56. Sprint could size by 0.04 increment and scale the line spacing and kerning accordingly. (The 192 pages size is important in the printing industry, where the number of pages often has to be divisible by 32. A 200-page book would have to be printed using 224 pages, the extra 24 pages being empty.)\n\nConsistency with familiar environments: The default editor key bindings were a subset of those provided by EMACS, and the mark-up language was a subset of Scribe, making it easy for people familiar with those tools to use Sprint.\n\n\"BYTE\" in 1984 praised FinalWord 1.16's low memory requirements and many powerful features. Criticisms included great difficulty in learning how to use it and instability, including a serious bug that destroyed four days of work. The magazine in 1989 listed Sprint as among the \"Distinction\" winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that \"if you can live without [WYSIWYG], Sprint may be all you need in word processing software\".\n\n\nManuals are on the \"Wayback Machine\", the Internet Archive in several formats, emobi, pdf, djvu, etc.\n\nFROM\nhttps://archive.org/search.php?query=borland%20sprint\n\n1.

The 1991 election was notable on several counts. It was the first parliamentary election to be held since the formation of the Third Republic, the first entirely free and competitive legislative election since the fall of communism, the first completely free legislative election of any sort since 1928, and only the fifth completely free election in all of Polish history. Due to the collapse of the Solidarity movement's political wing, the 1991 election saw deep political fragmentation, with a multitude of new parties and alliances emerging in its wake. Low voting thresholds within individual constituencies, along with a five percent national threshold allocated to a small portion of the Sejm, additionally contributed to party fragmentation. As a result, 29 political parties gained entry into the Sejm and 22 in the Senate, with no party holding a decisive majority. Two months of intense coalition negotiations followed, with Jan Olszewski of the Centre Agreement forming a minority government along with the Christian National Union, remnants of the broader Center Civic Alliance, and the Peasants' Agreement, with conditional support from Polish People's Party, Solidarity and other minor parties.\n\n460 members of parliament (\"poseł\") were elected; 391 from 6980 candidates from 37 regional lists of candidates and 69 from country-wide lists of candidates. In the Sejm elections, 27,517,280 citizens were eligible to vote, 11,887,949 (43.2%) of them cast their votes, 11,218,602 (94.4%) of those were counted as valid. In the Senate elections, 43.2% of citizens cast their votes, 96.5% were valid.\n\nElections were supervised by the National Electoral Commission (\"Państwowa Komisja Wyborcza\"). 37 regional (\"okręgowe\") commissions were formed, and 22,341 district (\"obwodowe\"), staffed by 197,389 citizens.\n\nA remarkable 111 parties competed and 29 parties (listed below) won Parliamentary seats. The success of the frivolous Polish Beer-Lovers' Party with 16 seats gained news coverage worldwide.\n\n"}

It was the eleventh race of the 2005 Formula One season and the last race for then Minardi driver Patrick Friesacher.\n\nFor the second consecutive race, Renault's Fernando Alonso took pole position while his championship rival, McLaren's Kimi Räikkönen, was demoted ten places on the grid following an engine failure. Räikkönen, who had originally qualified second with a time just 0.027 seconds slower than Alonso's, suffered this engine failure during Saturday free practice. This promoted BAR's Jenson Button, in his home race, to the front row, with the top ten being completed by Juan Pablo Montoya in the second McLaren, Jarno Trulli in the Toyota, Rubens Barrichello in the Ferrari, Giancarlo Fisichella in the second Renault, Takuma Sato in the second BAR, Ralf Schumacher in the second Toyota, Michael Schumacher in the second Ferrari, and Jacques Villeneuve in the Sauber. Jordan's Tiago Monteiro started at the rear of the grid after failing to set a time, following an engine failure during Friday practice.\n\nBefore the race, a minute of silence was held as a mark of respect for those who had lost their lives in the London bombings three days earlier.\n\nThe weather was hot, with air temperature at 30 °C, and the track temperature at 45 °C as the cars completed the formation lap. Sato stalled as he came to the grid, but race director Charlie Whiting nonetheless started the race, with the safety car being deployed on lap 2 to allow the marshals to safely return the BAR to the pit lane. Sato would eventually rejoin the race, two laps behind the leaders. Montoya made a fast start, passing Button off the grid and then overtaking Alonso for the lead into Becketts. After the safety car period, Montoya retained the lead until the first round of pit stops, although Alonso remained no more than a second and a half behind as he and the Colombian traded fastest laps. Button held third, while Barrichello and Fisichella passed a slow-starting Trulli, who in turn was holding up Michael Schumacher. Räikkönen, already up four places, was thus able to close up behind Schumacher and Trulli, but was unable to overtake them until the pit stops.\n\nMontoya made his first pit stop on lap 21, a lap earlier than planned due to traffic. Alonso followed on lap 23, rejoining the race almost side-by-side with Montoya, who again held his line. Fisichella led for the next two laps, setting the fastest lap in the process, before making his first stop. On lap 28, with every driver except Sato having pitted, Montoya led Alonso by three seconds, followed by Fisichella, Button, Barrichello, Räikkönen, Michael Schumacher and Trulli.\n\nOn lap 32 Barrichello, on a three-stop strategy, made his second stop. This enabled Räikkönen, now the fastest man on the track, to close up behind Button. Montoya responded to his team-mate's pace, and to Alonso, by setting back-to-back fastest laps on laps 40 and 41, increasing his lead over the Spaniard to over six seconds. On lap 43, Räikkönen took fourth when Button made his second stop, easily retaining this position after his own stop two laps later. Montoya pitted on lap 44, putting Alonso back in front, before Barrichello made his third stop on lap 45. On lap 46 Fisichella, on course for his first podium since winning the opening race of the season in Australia, made his second stop, but stalled as he tried to leave the pits, promoting Räikkönen to third.\n\nAlonso led for five laps before pitting on lap 49, but lost time trying to lap Trulli. This meant that he did not have a big enough lead to make his stop and rejoin the race in front of Montoya, though he was comfortably ahead of Räikkönen. In the end, the Colombian took his first win for McLaren by 2.7 seconds. Räikkönen set the fastest race lap on the final circuit to finish less than 12 seconds behind Alonso, while Fisichella ended up 3.5 seconds behind the Finn. Button finished a distant fifth, ahead of Michael Schumacher and Barrichello, while Ralf Schumacher edged out Toyota team-mate Trulli for the final point.\n\nThere was only one retirement in the race, Jordan's Narain Karthikeyan dropping out on lap 11 with an electrical failure.\n\nThe result allowed Alonso to increase his lead over Räikkönen in the Drivers' Championship by two points, 77 to 51. Michael Schumacher remained in third on 43 points, while Montoya moved up to sixth with 26. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren reduced the deficit to Renault by three points, 102 to 87, Ferrari remaining in third on 74.\n\n\n"}

After his playing career concluded, he served as an assistant coach at Florida Southern and then was elevated to the head coach position on May 9, 2012. He is the son of former MLB pitcher Joe Niekro and nephew of former MLB pitcher Phil Niekro.\n\nBorn in Winter Haven, Florida, Niekro graduated from George W. Jenkins High School in Lakeland, Florida, and attended Florida Southern College. While in high school, he had transitioned from being a knuckleball pitcher to a position player, playing third base at Florida Southern. In 1999 and 2000, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), and was named league MVP in 1999. He was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nNiekro was selected by the San Francisco Giants in the second round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft. He began his professional career as a third baseman, but moved to first base in the minor leagues due to injury. Niekro first reached the major leagues in , but only had five at bats. He saw more substantial playing time in , when he split time with J. T.

He fought under General Antonio López de Santa Anna during the Texas Revolution. Urrea's forces were never defeated in battle during the Texas Revolution. His most notable success was that of the Goliad Campaign, in which James Fannin's 400 soldiers were surrounded and induced to capitulate under terms, but were massacred in Urrea's absence on the orders of Santa Anna. Urrea also fought in the Mexican–American War.\n\nUrrea was born at the Presidio Real de San Augustín de Tucsón (now the U.S. city of Tucson, Arizona), during Spanish regime of the region. Despite being born on the northern frontier of Mexico, his family had deep roots in the state of Durango.\n\nIn 1807 Urrea entered the Spanish army. In 1824 he rose to the rank of captain, but he resigned from the army and entered private life. In 1829 he rejoined the military as a major and helped to liberate the city of Durango, allying himself with Antonio López de Santa Anna. He was promoted to colonel for his actions. In 1835 he reluctantly took part in Santa Anna's attack on the state of Zacatecas (the state had openly rebelled against his rise to power). Santa Anna promoted Urrea to Brigadier General for his role in this.\n\nWhen the Mexican state of Texas also revolted against Santa Anna's Centralist government, Urrea was sent there to help put down the colonists. He easily defeated small groups of Texan forces at the Battle of San Patricio, Battle of Refugio, and Battle of Coleto. The last, also known as the \"Goliad Massacre\", included the deliberate slaughter of Texans who had surrendered. The execution of prisoners, however, was not Urrea's choice, but an order by General Santa Anna.\n\nDue to Urrea's string of victories, Santa Anna decided to stay in Texas and personally finish off the rebellious Texas government. His motives were personal and political as Urrea was getting all the headlines and would be seen back in Mexico as a more popular figure.\n\nThe military defeat of Santa Anna's forces at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836 resulted in Santa Anna's capture, and him being forced to order all Mexican forces to withdraw from Texas soil. Urrea was infuriated and, after linking up with Vicente Filisola's forces, he wanted to continue the war against the Texans since the Mexicans still had over 2,500 troops in Texas against less than 900 of Sam Houston's Texans. But both Urrea and Filisola had no choice but to comply with Santa Anna's orders, so by the middle of June, Urrea and all Mexican forces had withdrawn from Texas. The Mexican authorities criticized Filisola for leading the retreat, stripped him of his command, and made Urrea the new commander of the army. Within a few months, Urrea gathered an army of 6,000 troops near Matamoros to finally reconquer Texas. However, the invasion never occurred as he and his troops were redirected to address several federalist rebellions across Mexico.\n\nIn 1837, Urrea turned against Santa Anna upon his return to Mexico, and fought against him at the Battle of Mazatlán in 1838. The attempted uprising resulted in his eventual arrest, and he was sent to Perote Prison. He later revived his military career with the invasion of French forces into Mexico, and another failed coup attempt followed.\n\nThe Mexican–American War saw Urrea leading a cavalry division against invading American troops. Urrea died August 1, 1849 of cholera shortly after the war ended.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Horne\n\nJames Wesley Horne (December 14, 1881June 29, 1942) was an early American actor, screenwriter and film director. He began his career as an actor under director Sidney Olcott at Kalem Studios in 1913 and directed his first film for the company two years later.\n\nDuring the silent-era Horne specialized in staging thrill scenes for features and serial films. On the strength of Horne's work in \"Cruise of the Jasper B\", Buster Keaton hired him to direct his 1927 comedy \"College\". From there he moved to Hal Roach Studios, where he worked with Roach's leading stars, Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase, Our Gang, and his nephew George Stevens, who worked at the studio as a cinematographer, who later progressed to directing short films, and from the late 1930s became a top Hollywood feature filmmaker. Horne's Laurel and Hardy comedies \"Big Business\" (credited to \"J. Wesley Horne\") and \"Way Out West\" are acclaimed as classics.\n\nHorne also displayed an aptitude for directing Roach's foreign-language versions; the American version might be staged by James Parrott, for example, but the international version would be entrusted to Horne.\n\nHorne left Roach in 1932 during an economic downturn that eliminated many jobs. He was hired by Universal Pictures where, for the next few years, he directed the studio's now-obscure two-reel comedies. When Universal suspended production, Horne worked briefly at Columbia Pictures and returned to Roach in 1935.\n\nIn 1937 Columbia, noting the popularity of serials, decided to enter the field. At first the studio simply picked up the independent productions of the Weiss Brothers' \"Adventure Serials\" company, but by 1938 Columbia wanted to produce serials with its own actors, technicians, and facilities. Former serial specialist James Horne co-directed (with Ray Taylor) the first of Columbia's own serials, and it turned out to be one of the studio's best. \"The Spider's Web\", starring Warren Hull as a masked crimefighter, was the most popular serial of 1938, surpassing such well-received serials as \"Buck Rogers\" and \"Dick Tracy Returns\" by a wide margin, according to a tally published in \"The Motion Picture Herald\".\n\nThis cemented Horne's position in Columbia's serial squad, and he directed cliffhangers exclusively (and without assistance) for the rest of his life. This job security seems to have prompted Horne to indulge his sense of humor, because most of his Columbia serials are tongue-in-cheek. Horne had his actors play their roles straight for the first three chapters—these would be the sample episodes used to sell the serial to exhibitors. Then, starting with Chapter 4, Horne would stray farther and farther from the straight melodramatic path, encouraging his actors to ham it up with overly dramatic readings, and staging ridiculous fight scenes (the hero would take on six thugs simultaneously and win). Horne kept the action barely serious enough to satisfy action fans, and in fairness to Horne many of his cliffhanging perils are very effectively staged. But the overall tone of Horne's serials is mock-serious, with urgent narration recapping the action (the 1960s \"Batman\" TV series copied Horne's style). \"The Green Archer\", which Horne co-wrote as well as directed, is probably the most satirically enjoyable of Horne's serials.\n\nJames W.

{"id": "2163790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163790", "title": "Terence Reese", "text": "Terence Reese\n\nJohn Terence Reese (28 August 1913 – 29 January 1996) was a British bridge player and writer, regarded as one of the finest of all time in both fields. He was born in Epsom, Surrey, England to middle-class parents, and was educated at Bradfield College and New College, Oxford, where he studied classics and attained a double first, graduating in 1935.\n\nReese's father, the son of a Welsh clergyman, worked in a bank until he transferred to his wife's family catering business. Reese said \"I played card games before I could read\". As a small boy, when his mother \"issued the standard warning about not talking to strange men, my father remarked that it was the strange men who should be warned against trying to talk to me\".\n\nReese's mother Anne ran a hotel near Guildford, and with it a bridge club, so Reese played in the earliest duplicate matches, \"circa\" 1930. Whilst at Oxford he met some serious bridge players, amongst whom were Lt.-Col. Walter Buller, Iain Macleod and Maurice Harrison-Gray, the strongest player in the country at that time. Within a year of graduating and after a brief stint at Harrod's, Reese started working for Hubert Phillips's magazine and co-wrote his first book with him in 1937. Phillips acknowledges that although the book is published jointly under their names, \"Terence is the real author of the book\", receiving only assistance in planning contents and editing from Phillips. From that point on, Reese's profession was that of a champion contract bridge player and prolific writer on the game.\n\nReese joined the ARP a few months before the war, and was never inducted into the armed forces. He ended up working in the factory of Pedro Juan (a fellow bridge player), which manufactured black-out curtains. When a Ministry of Labour inspector turned up to check on him, a hasty phone-call was needed to get Terence into an office surrounded by ledgers.\n\nReese had some hobbies; even those he pursued with typical commitment. He was always a cricket and chess enthusiast. After World War II, he made a book on greyhound racing; later he became an avid football fan, reputedly supporting Queen's Park Rangers, whose ground was next door to the White City Stadium, a home of greyhound racing. He played various other games for money, especially canasta, poker and backgammon, and wrote books on them.\n\nFrom the late 1930s to the mid-1950s, Reese presented a number of BBC radio and television programmes about bridge. He edited the \"British Bridge World\" from 1956 to 1962.\n\nHe married Alwyn Sherrington in 1970. They resided in London and later in Hove, Sussex, where he died of aspirin poisoning at home on 29 January 1996 at the age of 82. An inquest ruled his death accidental.\n\nAs a bridge player, Reese won every honour in the game, including the European Championship four times (1948, 1949, 1954, 1963) and the Bermuda Bowl (effectively, the World Team Championship) in 1955—all as a member of the Great Britain open team. He was World Par champion in 1961 and placed second in both the inaugural World Team Olympiad, 1960, and the inaugural World Open Pairs, 1962. He also represented Britain in the 1965 Bermuda Bowl and in five other European Championships. He won the Gold Cup, the premier British domestic competition, on eight occasions.\n\nReese last participated in international bridge at the 1976 World Team Olympiad in Monte Carlo, where Great Britain placed third. He was Britain's non-playing captain in the 1981 European Team Championships in Birmingham, England, placing second. Thus Great Britain qualified for the 1981 Bermuda Bowl, but the WBF credentials committee rejected Reese as captain, citing \"writings and opinions expressed by Mr. Reese that were considered not in the best interests of the game\", in the words of \"New York Times\" bridge editor Alan Truscott—primarily the \"sordid picture of top-level bridge\" presented by Reese and Jeremy Flint in their 1979 novel \"Trick Thirteen\". Britain appealed to the WBF executive council but Reese chose to remain home.\n\nPreferring backgammon as an alternative in his later years, Reese played little competitive bridge, owing in part to increasing deafness. However, his career as a bridge writer continued unabated.\n\nThe concept for \"the Little Major was born\" in late 1962, while Reese was en route to a tournament in the Canary Islands with Boris Schapiro.\n\nFirst with Schapiro and then Jeremy Flint, Reese initially created the \"Little Major\" bidding system as a warning of what would happen if the development of artificial bidding systems was allowed to go unchecked. However, under this camouflage, the system was a genuine attempt with interesting features. Ultimately, the system was abandoned when its two-year EBU 'A' license was withdrawn \"on the grounds that not enough players were playing the system\".\n\nReese's long-time partner, Boris Schapiro, put his opinion in a 1951 bridge magazine article:\n\nEleven years later, Schapiro still thought Reese was the best player in the country:\n\nUpon Reese's death in 1996, Schapiro wrote:\n\nVictor Mollo had this to say about Reese in 1967:\n\nAlan Truscott wrote in \"The New York Times\" two weeks after Reese's death:\n\nIn the 1965 Buenos Aires Bermuda Bowl, B. Jay Becker noticed Reese and his partner, Boris Schapiro, holding their cards in unusual ways during bidding, the number of fingers showing indicating length of the heart suit. A number of players and observers, including Dorothy Hayden, \"New York Times\" columnist Alan Truscott, John Gerber, British nonplaying captain Ralph Swimer, British Bridge League Chairman Geoffrey Butler, ACBL president emeritus Waldemar von Zedtwitz, and ACBL President Robin McNabb, all watched Reese and Schapiro and were convinced that they were signalling illegally. It was also confirmed that Reese was not using such signals while playing with his other partner, Jeremy Flint. At a hearing held at the tournament site in Buenos Aires, the World Bridge Federation (WBF) judged Reese and Schapiro guilty of cheating, and announced that due to \"certain irregularities\", the British team was forfeiting the matches they had already won against North America and Argentina, and that Reese and Shapiro would not be playing in the remaining matches.\n\nThe British Bridge League (BBL) subsequently convened their own enquiry, chaired by Sir John Foster, barrister and Member of Parliament, and General Lord Bourne. After hearing lasting many months, including a surprise revelation by Swimer that Schapiro had confessed his guilt to him, the \"Foster Enquiry\" found insufficient evidence to find Reese and Schapiro guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Without rebutting the \"direct\" evidence that grips were correlated with heart count, the report emphasized that there was inconclusive evidence that the players had benefitted from the signals in their bidding or play.\n\nIn 1967, the BBL asked the WBF to reverse their guilty finding; the WBF responded by unanimously reaffirming their guilty verdict, and later reiterating that they would not accept a British team including Reese and Schapiro for the 1968 Olympiad, which the BBL boycotted in protest. In 1968, a compromise was reached, the WBF maintaining their guilty verdict, but allowing Reese and Schapiro (who had announced his retirement from international bridge after the Buenos Aires Olympiad) to play in future world championships.\n\nSubsequently, both Reese and Alan Truscott published books on the scandal. Reese's book stated: \"The basis of the charge, as everybody knows, is that Schapiro and I communicated length in hearts to one another by means of illegal signals. If you want to support that charge by reference to the hands played, what you have to show is that a number of illogical, uncharacteristic, and implausible bids or plays were made that can be explained only on the basis that the players had improper knowledge of one another's hands.\" It then goes on to argue for the logic of the pair's bidding and play on the various hands from the Olympiad. Truscott's book emphasizes the unlikelihood of the observed variations in finger signals being coincidental, or of such a large number of witnesses colluding to fabricate the evidence. It also recounts a number of previous cheating accusations against Reese and Schapiro (including games other than bridge). \nIn May 2005, the English journalist David Rex-Taylor, a bridge player and publisher, claimed that Reese had made a confession to him forty years earlier, one that was not to be revealed until 2005 and after he and Schapiro were dead. The purported confession claimed that Reese and Schapiro were indeed signalling, but only to show that such signaling was possible (and so were not actually paying attention to each other's signals), purportedly as part of a book on cheating (which was abandoned after the scandal broke). Although this explanation could conceivably reconcile the use of finger signals with the absence of evidence from bidding or play, there is no corroborating evidence to support this account. In contrast, Schapiro's widow claims he continued to deny the accusations to his death.\n\nReese also had a successful career as a bridge author and journalist, a career that lasted throughout his life. He was one of the most influential and acerbic of bridge writers, with a large output (over ninety titles), including several books which remain in print as classics of bridge play. He was also the long-time bridge correspondent of \"The Lady\", \"The Observer\", the London \"Evening News\" and the \"Evening Standard\". He was also a frequent contributor to The Bridge World magazine which gave the following response to criticism of their continuing to publish articles by him after the Buenos Aires affair: \n\nReese contributed to the Acol bidding system originally developed by Maurice Harrison-Gray, Jack Marx and S.J.(\"Skid\") Simon in the late 1920s and early 1930s and co-authored the first textbook on it with Ben Cohen in 1938. Named after the Acol Bridge Club in North London (located on Acol Road at the time), it became the prevailing bidding system in Britain and some other parts of the world. The book and its subsequent editions in 1939, 1946 and 1949 gave unity to what was otherwise a rather free-wheeling bidding system. His later adaptation of Garozzo and Yallouze's book on the Blue Club and his book on the Precision Club were widely used by devotees of strong club systems, and by their opponents as references.\n\nThe great success of \"Reese on Play\" (an outstanding guide to dummy play and defence) was followed by an even more ambitious work. \"The Expert Game\" was the book which really made his name. As the title suggests, it dealt with card play at the highest level, including some ideas that were novel at the time, for instance, inferences from events that did not occur, and the principle of restricted choice. Examples of bridge logic abound in Reese, for instance, a player who overcalls but does not lead his suit is likely to lack one or two key honours; this concept is often called 'the dog that did not bark in the night' (after Sherlock Holmes in Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Adventure of Silver Blaze\"). Another form of logic can be seen in 'If it must be so, assume it is so'. His examples of \"counting\" (and other ways of drawing inferences from the bidding and play) spread such ideas from a coterie of masters in London (or New York) to a much wider group of nascent experts. For at least twenty years after this book was published, one could be sure that virtually every top-class player had studied it minutely.\n\nReese also had the distinction of creating several new genres of bridge book. The most significant was the 'Over my shoulder' genre, where the reader is taken through the master's thinking as the bidding and play proceeds through the hand. \"Play Bridge with Reese\" was the model for several such works. \"Develop Your Bidding Judgment\" was another such work.\n\nLater, Reese made use of the growing library of hands from international competitions to create interesting quiz-type books, where the discussion was usually on the verso of the page which presented the problem. \"Famous Hands from Famous Matches\" was the first of these, followed by \"Famous Bidding Decisions\" and \"Famous Play Decisions\", all written with David Bird. In his career as a writer, Reese had a number of co-authors, mostly highly competent players and writers, yet all his books were in his inimitable style. Another of his ideas was to raid the stock of hands in bridge magazine bidding competitions for interesting and instructive hands. \"What Would You Bid?\" was the result.\n\nReese also wrote books on poker, casino gambling, canasta and backgammon.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2163808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163808", "title": "Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park", "text": "Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park\n\nPaynes Prairie Preserve State Park is a Florida State Park, encompassing a savanna in Micanopy, Florida, south of Gainesville. It is also a U.S. National Natural Landmark. It is crossed by both I-75 and U.S. 441 (which has a scenic outlook ramp). It is in the center of the Paynes Prairie Basin. The basin's primary source of drainage is Alachua Sink. During occasional wet periods, the basin will become full. A notable period occurred from 1871 to 1891 when the Alachua Sink was temporarily blocked. During this period, shallow draft steamboats were a frequent sight on Alachua Lake in the center of the prairie. The region was also historically known as the Alachua Savannah. Its drainage has been modified by several canals. Since 1927, Camps Canal has linked the basin to the River Styx which leads to Orange Lake and eventually the Atlantic Ocean through the St. Johns River. That reduced the basins water intake by half. Additional changes to the prairie's environment have been detrimental to its hydrology. In 1970, the state of Florida acquired the land and has been in the process of restoring the environment to a more natural condition ever since.\n\nHeavy rains have temporarily restored Alachua Lake on several occasions, most recently in September 2017, when Hurricane Irma dropped several inches of rain and damaged a levee, flooding much of the basin for months.\n\nBefore 1637, Francisco Menéndez Márquez the royal treasurer of Spanish Florida established Rancho la Chúa in the vicinity of Paynes Prairie. It spanned and would be by the late 17th-century the largest cattle ranch in the colony. It was raided several times by various Native groups and by French buccaneers. It became abandoned by 1706.\n\nThe prairie became the stronghold of the Alachua band of the Seminole tribe under chief Ahaya the Cowkeeper by the mid-1700s. The Seminole town of Cuscowilla was located near modern Micanopy, Florida. In 1774 the area, then known as Alachua Savannah, was visited by William Bartram who noted in his book, \"Bartram's Travels\", that it was used as grazing ground by the local Seminole.\n\nBy the 1790s, Cuscowilla had been relocated to a site east of Lake Wauburg and become known as Paynes Town. The town and the surrounding prairie was named for the Cowkeeper's eldest surviving son, Payne. Paynes Town was destroyed by Tennessee Volunteers in 1813. Fort Tarver and Ford Crane were both located in Paynes Prairie during the Second Seminole War.\n\nAfter Indian Removal, the area became inhabited by European Americans, their slaves, and very small number of free people of color. A railroad line was built along the northern edge of the prairie in the late 1800s.\n\nIn 1868, heavy rains filled the basin, but quickly drained away. About 1871, Alachua Sink was temporarily blocked and the basin became full for several years. From 1871 to 1891 Alachua Lake was receiving enough water that steamboats were able to be used on it. A line ran from Chacala Pond to Sweetwater Branch. About 1889, the water level of Alachua Lake began to slowly drop. During the winter of 1890/1891 the lake was 58 feet deep. Then in late July and August 1891, the water levels of Alachua Lake suddenly dropped. Its banks were littered with dead fish and dead alligators. At one point, the water levels dropped eight feet in the span of ten days and left the lake with only its two main basins with any water. This draining event marooned one of the steamers then plying the lake, and similar events had occurred in 1823 and 1870.\n\nBy the 1920s, most of the prairie had been purchased by Camp Ranch, Inc. In 1927, Camp Ranch, Inc. built a canal system to divert water coming into Alachua Lake in the Paynes Prairie Basin from Newnans Lake to Orange Lake through the River Styx. The diversion of the water meant a loss of 50% of the surface water supply to Paynes Prairie. That same year, the state of Florida built U.S. 441 through the basin. In 1937, Camp Ranch began construction on the Sweetwater Branch Canal. It was designed to channelize the flow from Sweetwater Branch directly into Alachua sink instead of allowing it to settle in Lake Alachua. The subsequent urbanization of Gainesville increased the amount of stormwater directed into Sweetwater Branch and also pollutants. In 1964, the construction of I-75 through the western section of the prairie was completed.\n\nIn 1970, the state of Florida acquired the land from Camp Ranch, Inc. It was designated a natural landmark in December 1974. In 1975, the Florida Park Service temporarily restored half of the historic rate of flow of water from Newnans Lake to Paynes Prairie. During the 1970s and 1980s, officials reintroduced several species to Paynes Prairie.\n\nAs of 2013, Paynes Prairie receives one-third of its water from Newnans Lake, one-third from all other sources, and one-third from direct rainfall. The removal of the canals that same year had restored 7.95 miles of dikes and canals. Due to occasional heavy rains the rate of water from Prairie Creek to the Prairie is eliminated entirely to prevent damage to U.S. 441.\n\nIn the mids-2010s, the , a 125-acre constructed enhancement wetland, was put in place on the northern section of Paynes Prairie. The project was designed to restore sheetflow to parts of the prairie obstructed by the Sweetwater Branch Canal and to also reduce the TMDL to acceptable levels that the Alachua Sink experiences. The Sweetwater Wetlands Park opened in May 2015.\n\nThe status of the highways on low dikes has led to some within Florida's Department of Environmental Protection to recommend their possible replacement with raised roadways on bridges to ameliorate the biological and hydrological impact of the roadways as they currently exist. Replacements of other canals has also been planned. There are also plans to protect and promote various archaeological and historical sites on the prairie.\n\nPaynes Prairie is part of the Southeastern conifer forests ecoregion. The prairie itself is a large Floridian highlands freshwater marsh, composed of different herbaceous plant communities that vary based on water depth. Wet, forested areas have southern coastal plain nonriverine basin swamps of bald cypress (\"Taxodium distichum\") and swamp tupelo (\"Nyssa biflora\"). Southern coastal plain blackwater river floodplain forests grow along streams. On drier uplands, southern coastal plain oak domes and hammocks of southern live oak (\"Quercus virginiana\") grow in areas with moderately moist soils, and Florida longleaf pine sandhills grow on drier, sandier soils.\n\nOver 270 species of birds can be seen in the park as well as American alligators and small herds of Florida Cracker horses and Florida Cracker cattle, first herded by the Seminole were introduced in 1985. The plains bison were reintroduced to the park from the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge in 1975, as part of the park service goal of restoring Florida's natural resources to pre-European settler conditions; they roamed this area until the late 18th century. When bison sightings occur, they usually appear along the Cone's Dike trail. The herd was reduced from thirty-five to seven individuals in the mid-1980s after an outbreak of Brucellosis. In the late 1990s, the herd was again reduced after inbreeding concerns. The buffalo herd reached a peak of 70 animals in 2011. The park began culling excessive animals in 2012, allowing a target population of about 8 to 10 bison to be free to roam the Florida prairie.\n\nThe park contains exhibits and an audio-visual program at the visitor center that explains the area's natural and cultural history. A -high observation tower near the visitor center provides a panoramic view of the preserve. Eight different trails provide opportunities for hiking, horseback riding, and bicycling. Ranger-led activities are offered on weekends, November through April. Fishing on Lake Wauburg is allowed and a boat ramp provides access for canoes and boats with electric motors. Full-facility campsites are available for overnight visitors.\n\nThe Sweetwater Wetlands Project includes a network of trails that allow visitors to walk along the berms that form the enhancement wetland, an outdoor classroom, a viewing tower, and a visitors center.\n\nThe park is a 'gateway site' for the Great Florida Birding Trail.\n\nThe space shuttle could be seen from Paynes Prairie about a minute into its flight.\n\nThe Gainesville-Hawthorne State Trail also runs through Paynes Prairie. Several scenic view points lead off of the trail and into the park. Wildlife will often come up to the trail at certain times in the day.\n\nThe park is located at 100 Savannah Blvd., Micanopy, FL 32667. Florida state parks are open between 8 a.m. and sundown every day of the year (including holidays).\n\nAlachua Lake flows into the Florida aquifer through Alachua Sink. Once underground, the water then flows northwest towards the Santa Fe River Basin. The prairie receives water from a number of sources.\n\n\nAs of 2013, Paynes Prairie had about 38 miles of dikes and 50 miles of canals. They include\n\n\n"}

The population at the 2011 Census was 4,123 residents. Old Altona was founded in 1880 by Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from the Russian Empire. It is surrounded by the Municipality of Rhineland. Much of the surrounding area is devoted to farming and agriculture-based business. \nPlautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from Russia began settling in Manitoba from 1874 through 1880 after signing a Privilegium with the Canadian government. The settlers initially were located in the Mennonite Reserve (largely now the Rural Municipality of Hanover). This area, east of the Red River and south of the Seine River, became known as the East Reserve when another block of land west of the Red River, known as the West Reserve was granted for Mennonite settlement in 1876, which included the land to become Altona. The first settlement at Altona was made in 1880, by Bergthal Mennonites from the East Reserve nearby. A southern spur of the Canadian Pacific Railway went through the Altona village area in 1882. A separate town-site, also named Altona, had its start in the 1895 when the Canadian Pacific Railroad was extended to that point, with the village area later known as Old Altona. While Altona had a population large enough to support incorporation by the late 1920s, it took until 1946 for the community to be incorporated as a village. Its population at that time was 1065 residents. In 1956, population growth to 1698 residents prompted the village council to apply to the provincial government to change the status to town. This change became official on 24 October 1956.\n\nThe 2011 Canadian Census reported that Altona had a population of 4,088, a 10.2 per cent increase since 2006. Not surprisingly given the town's Mennonite founders, of 3,990 respondents, 1,415 listed their mother tongue as German, though this may also include Plautdietsch. The median age of the population reported was 39.2 years.\n\nAltona was the site of the Rhineland Consumers Co-operative (founded 1931 ), the Altona Co-op Service (founded 1937), the Altona Credit Union (founded 1939) and Co-op Vegetable Oils (CVO) (founded 1943). These co-operative enterprises were a highly effective local response to the devastating impact of the Great Depression on local farmers' incomes. Jake (J.J.) Siemens played an important role in their development, and the growth of the co-operative movement in southern Manitoba.\n\nBunge Limited now operates the oil-seed crushing plant in Altona, after buying the assets from Canamera Foods.\nAltona is also home to Friesens Corporation, which started off as a small confectionery store opened by David W. Friesen in 1907 and now employs hundreds of people. It is the primary printer of yearbooks in North America, as well as printing in commercial consumer books, specializing in full colour art and educational books. The town is also the headquarters for Golden West Broadcasting.\n\nThe first Mennonite Central Committee self-help centre (now Gift and Thrift Store) in Canada was founded in Altona in 1972. Staffed by volunteers, MCC Thrift stores now contribute about $4M annually to MCC projects. The store has been expanded numerous times, and is still completely volunteer-run. The proceeds raised all go to MCC charitable projects.\n\nAltona, Manitoba is known as \"The Sunflower Capital of Canada\", and is host to the annual Sunflower Festival, which began in 1965. The Sunflower Festival has a Sunflower festival pageant where they crown a queen every year, who wins a trip to Australia. The festival also includes a small midway, quilt show, baseball tournament, stage show, and street dance to name a few. In 2008, the Town of Altona opened an Art Gallery and Sculpture Garden, displaying many different styles of artwork.\n\nAltona's sister city is Emerald, Queensland, Australia. Every year a Sunflower Festival is held in which a young woman in the community is crowned the Sunflower Queen and gets a flight to Emerald for free to participate in the Sunflower Festival held there.\n\nThe community is home to the largest replica of a famous painting by Vincent van Gogh. It was named 'The largest painting on an easel by The Guinness Book of World Records in 1998. It was the first of three works in the Big Easel Project by local artist Cameron Cross, based on the painting \"Sunflowers\". The base (easel) stands at 76'6\" and the canvas was made by laminating together 24 sheets of 3/4\" plywood and splattering it with 17 gallons of paint to create the picture.\n\nThe Trans Canada Trail goes through Altona, heading south to Gretna and west to Rosengart through Buffalo Creek Nature Park.\n\nOakview Golf & Country Club is located south of Altona.\n\nAltona Municipal Airport is about 2.8 km southeast of the town.\n\nManitoba Highway 30 is the main north-south route. It begins in Gretna, and passes on the east border of Altona to Rosenfeld. \nManitoba Provincial Road 201 is the main east-west route.\nIn the late 1990s the town, in partnership with various businesses and volunteers, embarked on an ambitious plan to improve recreation facilities. In 2000, the Altona Aquatic Centre opened to rave reviews, a trails system was started, and in 2003 the Millennium Exhibition Centre opened. This 75,000 square-foot facility features an ice arena, curling arena, banquet hall, meeting rooms, running track, concessions, kitchens and community spaces. Since then, other recreation facilities have been added such as a triples tennis court, a large playground, and most recently in 2013 a $250,000 skate park, and a second full size baseball diamond set to open in 2014 - to be known as Access Field.\n\nAltona is the located in, and home to the head office of, the Border Land School District. W.C. Miller Collegiate is the high school in the town.\n\nOther schools within Altona are École Elmwood School (grades K-3), École West Park School (grades 4-6), and École Parkside School (grades 7-8).\n\nThe town is serviced by the Red River Valley Echo newspaper, now part of the Postmedia Network.\n\nRadio station CFAM (AM 950) is part of the Golden West Broadcasting group.\n\n\n"}

He was loyal to Ahl al-Bayt in spite of his absence at the Battle of Karbala. He is reported to have said: ”Thanks to God Almighty, I could not supportal-Husayn ibn Ali at Karbala, but my two sons (’Awn and Muhammad) did. According to Richard Francis Burton he is widely recognized as the most sympathetic amongst Arabs. His grave is situated near Aqeel ibn Abi Talib and Abu Sufyan bin al-Harith (the grandson of Abd al-Muttalib) in Janatual Baqi) \nHe was the son of Ja'far ibn Abu Talib and Asma bint Umais. They had emigrated to Abyssinia in 616, and Abdullah and his two brothers were born there. Abdullah was the first of Muslims to be born in the land of Abyssinia After birth of Abdullah in Abyssinia (Habesha Presently Ethiopia), king of the Kingdom of Aksum ( Al-Najashi) was blessed with a son too. He immediately asked the parents of Abdullah Ibn Jaffar about the name of their child. Upon knowing the name of Jaffar family, King of Abyssinia also chose the name “Abdullah” for his first son. It is also stated that Asma bint Umays was the nursing mother of son of Abyssinian King. The younger brother of Abdullah appears to be the first child in the Muslim history who was named Muhammad after the Prophet of Islam.\nThe family returned to Arabia in 628 and settled in Medina.\n\nIn addition to Ibn Hajar' reference, it is said that after 3 days of Jafar’s death Muhammad went to house of Asma and called for children of Jafar. He then said about each of them “As for Muhammad, he resemble our uncle Abi Talib. As for Abdullah, he resembles me in terms of both my appearance and character. Afterward, Muhammad took the right hand of Abdullah and said “O Allah, provide a successor for Jafar in his family, and bless Abdullah in his business, and repeated this appeal to Al-mighty thrice. Muhammad instructed the sons of Abi Talib, namely Jafar, Aqeel and Ali that they should arrange marriages of their children with their cousins.\n\nAli had particularly wished that his daughters should marry Ja'far's sons. When Abdullah asked for Zainab's hand, Ali accepted it. Abdullah and Zainab had five children.\n\nAccording to Shaikh Muhammad Abbas Qummi, he had 20 sons from different wives, including 5 children from Zainab Binte Ali. Daira-e-Maarif Islamia (Circle of Islamic Knowledge) of University of Punjab (pages 568-70, Vol.X) describes that Zainabi is a progeny of Abdullah’s son Ali through Zainab binte Ali\n\nAbdullah Bin Jaffar-e-Tayyar was one of the richest people in Madina and a famous philanthropist who was called as “Bahrul Joud” which means an ocean of charity.\n\nWhen Ali became the Caliph in 656 and moved from Medina to Kufa, Zainab and Abdullah joined him.\n\nIt is related that Zainab already forecast the journey (journey to Karbala) before her marriage and permission for accompanying with her brother was obtained during marriage negotiations.\nWith regard to Absent of Abdullah in battle of Karbala, it is said it was due to his poor eye sighting consequently he was unable to bear the rigidities of journey and war. Knowing Hussain’s journey to Kufa, Zainab, the wife of Abdullah ibn Jaffar begged her husband’s permission to accompany her brother. Realizing anxiousness of her husband she stated that:\nAbdullah then granted his permission and sent their two sons for the destined journey.\n\nAbdullah was concurrently married to Layla bint Masud. With reference to books ‘Nasab e Quraish Page-83’ and ‘Jameerath ul Nasab by Ibn Hazm page 62’ it is described that Layla Binte Masood bin Khalid was “Zoja-e-Sani (second wife)” through this marriage he had two daughters (Umme Muhammad and Umme Abhiha) and four sons (Yahya, Haroon, Suleh & Musa).\n\nBattles:With regard to his presence in the Battle of Camel, it is indicated that at the end of Battle, while entrusting save return of mother of Believers to Medina under security of her brother Muhammad Bin Abi Bakar, Ali ordered for payment of 12,000/- Dirhams to Aisha. Abdullah thinking that amount as too little, brought out a huge sum for Aisha, the wife of the Prophet. According to Ahmad ibn A'tham in battle of Siffin he was commanding the infantry in the army of Ali bin Abi Talib together with his cousin Muslim bin Aqeel, Muhammad bin Hanfia and step brother Muhammad bin Abi Bakar.\n\nPolitics:He was a staunch supporter of his uncle Ali in the Civil War but later disdained from politics. He maintained a reputation for liberality and patronage in Medina, earning him the nickname “the Ocean of Generosity”. After killing of Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Abdullah bin Jaffar together with his cousins Hassan and Hussain participated in washing the body and dressed him for burial in three robes without a Kurta (a long shirt).\n\nIn addition to some spy reporting to Ali Ibn Abi Talib that Qays bin Sad bin Ubadah, his governor at Egypt had given allegiance to Muawiya, he received his letter which was written in perspective of affairs emerged on account of a conspiracy caused by opponent of Ali. Ali called his sons and Abdallah bin Ja'far and consulted the matter. Upon advice of Abdullah, Ali wrote a letter ordering Qays bin Sad to seek the people to give their allegiance as the Muslims have done (after the 3rd Caliph). But, if they do not, then fight them. The governor of Egypt against this communication wrote a letter to Ali Ibn Abi Talib. Then Abdullah Bin Jaffar requested his father in law to replace Qays bin Sad bin Ubadah with Muhammad Bin Abi Bakar as governor of Egypt and pleaded that if he really has gone over to Mu`awiyah, he will refuse to give up Egypt. However, according to Tabri it was a poor advice consequent to meeting of Qays bin Sad with Ali during the period of killing of Muhammad bin Abi Bakar.\n\nOnce a Chief of Iraqi village asked Abdullah Bin Jafar to recommend his case before Caliph Ali for accomplishment. He did so and matter of that chief was satisfied by Ali Ibn Abi Talib. As a gratification the chief sent 40,000 Darhims through some people to Abdullah, who refused the money saying that we do not sell our good deeds\n\nKnowing death of his two sons in the battle of Karbala, people were offering condolences to Abdullah, one of his Mawili (Abu al-Lislas [a companion]) said that “this is what we have met and what has come upon us through Hussain Ibn Ali” on this statement he struck him with his sandal and told that I am pleased that my two sons killed with my brother and cousin. By God! If I had been present with him, I would have preferred not to leave him in order that I would be killed with him. He then seeking attention of people consoling him, said that “Praise be to God, Who has made life hard, console Hussain Ibn Ali with my own hands, my two sons consoled him. \n\nAccording to Ibn Khaldun in chapter 2 volume II title “Yazid-I” from 60 to 64 AH, it is described that Abdullah sent a letter through his sons Awn & Muhammad, to Hussain, requesting that “for God sake come back. It is my advice to you in anxiety that you would be killed and Ahle-Bayt destroyed. As a result, earth’s light will come to an end, there would be no leader for Muslims. Please do not hurry in journey, I would be reaching there after this letter.\" Later he went to Amr bin Said who was Yazid's governor of Mecca and asked him to write a letter to Hussain offering him a guarantee of harmless behavior assuring him kindness and open-handedness. \"Show trust to him in your letter and request him to return.\" This letter was replied by Hussain too.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2163851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163851", "title": "View Askewniverse", "text": "View Askewniverse\n\nThe View Askewniverse is a fictional universe created by writer/director Kevin Smith, featured in several films, comics and a television series; it is named for Smith's production company, View Askew Productions. The characters Jay and Silent Bob appear in almost all the View Askewniverse media, and characters from one story often reappear or are referred to in others. Smith often casts the same actors for multiple characters in the universe, sometimes even in the same film; Smith himself portrays the character of Silent Bob.\n\nSmith's recurring characters, settings, and motifs first appeared in his debut film, \"Clerks\". Since then, the main canon has consisted of eight feature films, in addition to several short films, comic books, and a short-lived animated TV series. The View Askewniverse is centered on the towns of Leonardo, Highlands, and Red Bank, all located in Monmouth County, central New Jersey. \"Chasing Amy\" also takes place partly in New York City, while \"Dogma\", \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\", and \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot\" involve road trips.\n\n\"Clerks\" is the first film in the series of the View Askewniverse. It follows a day in the lives of two store clerks, Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson). Dante is called into work at the Quick Stop convenience store on his day off until the boss can relieve him at noon. As Dante serves a succession of customers, he repeatedly complains that he is \"not even supposed to be here today\". Randal works at RST Video next door, although he spends almost the entire day relaxing at the Quick Stop. Dante learns he will be working all day, and decides to close the store for brief periods to play hockey on the roof and to attend a memorial service for his ex-girlfriend. An old flame now engaged surprises him with a visit. The two had been talking on the phone for months and after seeing each other again they are keen to reunite and leave their current relationships.\n\nTakes place one day before the events in \"Clerks\". The film is about two young men, Brodie Bruce and T.S. Quint, who hang out at a mall after being dumped by their girlfriends; while also trying to avoid the wrath of Shannon Hamilton.\n\nA heterosexual man, Holden McNeil, falls in love with a lesbian woman, Alyssa Jones, causing conflict with his homophobic best friend, Banky Edwards, with whom he has created a comic book called \"Bluntman and Chronic\" based upon their friends Jay and Silent Bob.\n\nThe world ends if two angels enter a church in New Jersey and it is up to Jesus' last scion, Jay and Silent Bob, and the thirteenth Apostle to stop them.\n\nJay and Silent Bob embark on a road-trip to Hollywood to try to stop a \"Bluntman and Chronic\" movie from being made. Within the film, the \"Bluntman and Chronic\" movie was to be based on the comic made by the protagonists of \"Chasing Amy\".\n\nRoughly ten years after \"Clerks\", Dante and Randal are now employed in the fast food industry.\n\nThe animated film depicts the events within the \"Bluntman and Chronic\" comic written by the protagonist of \"Chasing Amy\", which was to be adapted into a movie in \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\". Kevin Smith adapted the script from the \"Bluntman and Chronic\" comics story he had originally written as a companion piece to the film \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\".\n\nAfter losing the legal rights to their names over a film reboot of \"Bluntman and Chronic\", Jay and Silent Bob travel across the United States in an attempt to prevent the reboot from being made.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Clerks II\", Smith reported that for several years after, a script was finished, but production was delayed in favor of other projects. By February of 2017, he announced via his social media page that development had stopped, and the film would not be made, when Jeff Anderson dropped out of the project. \n\nBy September of 2019, Smith announced that he had scrapped the previous draft, and had begun working a whole new script for the project. The filmmaker confirmed that many of the creatives from the previous films including Jason Mewes, Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran would return. The new \"Clerks III\" would follow Dante and Randal, after surviving a heart attack, making a movie at the store. The plot was initially conceived for a film adaptation of \"\" titled \"\".\n\nOn March 13, 2015, Kevin Smith confirmed that \"Mallrats 2\" was being written and was slated to begin shooting in Summer 2016. In April 2015, Smith announced that \"Mallrats 2\" would be his next film, instead of \"Clerks III\" as originally intended, and would begin filming in 2015. In January 2020, Smith announced that development on \"Mallrats 2\" has started up again, under a new title \"Twilight of the Mallrats\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, STX Entertainment announced that their Surreal division was working with Kevin Smith on a VR series that would star Jay and Silent Bob.\n\nSmith often casts the same actors for multiple characters in the universe, sometimes even in the same film. This is most notable in \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\", in which several actors play multiple characters from earlier View Askewniverse films.\n\nTo date, Smith and Jason Mewes are the only actors to appear in every film as the same characters. Three other actors have appeared in every film, as different characters, Scott Mosier, Walt Flanagan and Brian O'Halloran, with O'Halloran always appearing as a member of the Hicks family (most notably Dante).\n\nThe more notable recurring actors include:\n\n\nA beat-em up videogame titled \"Jay and Silent-Bob: Chronic Blunt Punch\", released in April of 2016. The game was produced by a successful crowdfunding.\n\n\nFollowing \"Clerks,\" Smith wrote a film called \"Busing\" for Hollywood Pictures, a now-defunct Disney studio. It was described as \"\"Clerks\" in a restaurant.\" The film was announced around 1994 and was intended to be part of the View Askewniverse. The film was not made, but the film was featured at the end of \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" as a poster parodying the \"Clerks\" poster.\n\nA follow-up to \"Chasing Amy\", Smith wrote a new film set in the View Askewniverse starring the trio from \"Amy\" that was not a sequel. Smith said \"it was kind of porn-bent.\" Affleck and Adams were interested in doing the project, but plans eventually fell through. Smith's efforts to develop a project about pornography led to the 2008 film, \"Zack and Miri Make a Porno\". Smith abandoned \"Name\" in favor of \"Dogma\".\n\nIn late November 2005, Smith responded to talk of a possible sequel to \"Dogma\" on the ViewAskew.com message boards:\n\nOver a decade later, there has apparently been no further discussion. But in October 2017, Smith revealed that he no longer desired to make any new religious films.\n\nNear the same time as the cancellation, just weeks before the Weinstein scandal broke to the public, Harvey Weinstein pitched to Smith about doing a sequel. Not much came from this pitch, but it was just a mere idea for Weinstein. According to Smith in an interview with Business Insider, he recalls:\n\nSmith believes that he only got the call because, as he believes, \"It was him looking to see who was a friend still because his life was about to shift completely.\"\n\nFor several years following the cancellation of \"\", Smith announced plans to make an animated film. He revealed in a commentary on Episode 6 that it would go theatrical (with the hopes to win an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature), but later made plans to go direct-to-video. The basic plot involved Dante and Randal making a movie about their lives at the Quick Stop, a reference to the production of the original film. In an interview, Kevin Smith expanded on the delays surrounding the film. He stated that when Harvey and Bob Weinstein left Miramax, owned at the time by The Walt Disney Company, the split was not completely amicable. The rights to the \"Clerks\" television series were still owned by Disney, who as a result were reluctant to work with The Weinstein Company, throwing the future of \"Clerks: Sell Out\" into question. At the 2007 Cornell Q&A, Smith said due to the Miramax/Weinstein argument \"you will see a Jay and Silent Bob cartoon before \"Clerks: Sell Out\".\" \n\nDespite the fact that \"Sell Out\" might not get made, Smith's new script for the long-awaited \"Clerks III\" will follow the original plot from the animated film.\n\n"}

{"id": "2163869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163869", "title": "1408 (short story)", "text": "1408 (short story)\n\n\"1408\" is a short story by Stephen King. It is the third tale in the audiobook collection \"Blood and Smoke\", released in 1999. In 2002, \"1408\" was collected in written form as the 12th story in King's collection \"Everything's Eventual\". In the introduction to the story, King says that \"1408\" is his version of what he calls the \"Ghostly Room at the Inn\", his term for the theme of haunted hotel or motel rooms in horror fiction. He originally wrote the first few pages as part of an appendix for his non-fiction book, \"\" (2000), to be used as an example of how a story changes from one draft document to the next. King also noted how the numbers of the title add up to the supposedly unlucky number 13.\n\nMike Enslin is a writer of non-fiction works based on the theme of haunted places: \"Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Houses\", \"Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Graveyards\", and \"Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Castles\". They prove to be best-sellers, but Enslin feels some guilt at their success, privately acknowledging that he does not believe in the paranormal and supernatural elements he investigates.\n\nArriving at the Dolphin Hotel on 61st Street in New York City, Enslin is intent on spending the night in the hotel's infamous Room 1408 as part of his research for his next book, \"Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Hotel Rooms\". He is met by the hotel's manager, Mr. Olin, who fills him in on the room's morbid history – 1408 has been responsible for 42 deaths, at least 12 of them suicides, over a span of 68 years. While remarking he does not believe there are ghosts in 1408, Olin insists there is \"something\" that resides inside, causing terrible things to happen to anyone who stays within its walls for anything but the briefest periods of time. As such, he has striven to keep the room vacant during his tenure as manager, a period of nearly 20 years. Olin also reveals that, due to the superstitious practice of never recognizing the 13th floor (the room is listed as being on the 14th), it is a room cursed by existing on the 13th floor, the room numbers adding up to 13 making it all the worse.\n\nEnslin is secretly affected by Olin's remarks and evidence, but his determination to not appear superstitious and follow through with his research wins out. He demands the right stay in the room by threatening legal action against the hotel. Olin pleads with Enslin to reconsider, believing that a skeptic would be highly susceptible to the room's powers. At Enslin's continued insistence, Olin reluctantly leads him to 1408, unwilling to accompany him farther than the elevator landing on the 14th floor.\n\nEnslin's problems with Room 1408 begin before he even sets foot through the door; the door itself initially appears to be canted to the left. After looking away and back, the door appears perfectly straight. Then, after looking a third time, it appears to be crooked again, except now to the right. Chalking the experience up to Olin's attempt to manipulate him, he girds himself and enters the room. \n\nEnslin spends 70 minutes in Room 1408, dictating his experience into a handheld tape recorder. Almost immediately, his train of thought takes unwelcome and chaotic turns — he compares it to being \"stoned on bad, cheap dope\" — and he experiences bizarre visual hallucinations. A breakfast menu on the night-stand changes languages to French, then Russian, then Italian, then a woodcut of a wolf eating a screaming boy's leg. The patterns on the wallpaper seems to shift and warp, and the room's pictures transform into grotesque parodies. Enslin feels his feet sink into the carpet like quicksand, and he hears a nightmarish voice on the room's phone chanting terrifying phrases: \"This is nine! Nine! We have killed your friends! Every friend is now dead! This is six! Six!\"\n\nThe room itself begins to melt, the walls and ceiling warping and bowing inward. Enslin senses a dangerous, otherworldly presence coming for him. In desperation, he sets his \"lucky\" Hawaiian shirt on fire while wearing it, breaking the room's spell long enough for him to escape. Stumbling out into the hall, another hotel guest douses him with ice. When the other guest looks inside the room and is tempted to enter, Enslin warns him not to, claiming the room is \"haunted\". The door slams shut.\n\nAfter his ordeal, Enslin gives up writing altogether. He has acquired various physical and psychological problems stemming from his brief stay in the room. He notes to himself (as Olin expressed earlier) that there are no ghosts in 1408, because ghosts were once merely humans, while the entity he encountered was horrifically inhuman. In the end, Enslin sleeps with his lights on, has removed all his house's phones, and always draws the curtains before dark; he cannot stand the shade of yellow-orange at sunset that reminds him of the light inside Room 1408.\n\n\nThe Swedish film director Mikael Håfström developed a movie, \"1408\", based on the short story, starring John Cusack as Michael Enslin and Samuel L. Jackson as Mr. Olin. It was released June 22, 2007 and was a financial success in its opening weekend, taking in $20.1 million.\n\nThe Bollywood movie \"Horror Story\" is based on this.\n\n"}

In 2019 she was repainted in the No. 54 Squadron code 'KL-B', which represents the aircraft flown by Al Deere from 10 July 1940 until 31 August 1940.\n\nThe Mk Vb Spitfire, AB910, escorted convoys in the Battle of the Atlantic. She then flew escort patrols during bombing raids on the German battleships \"Scharnhorst\" and \"Gneisenau\", then (as part of No. 133 squadron), she fought in the Dieppe Raid. Capping this long career, as part of No. 402 Squadron RCAF, she flew cover patrols over the Normandy beaches on D-Day and in the subsequent weeks – as did another of the flight's Spitfires, with No. 443 Squadron RCAF. As of August 2018, AB910 was adorned with the D-Day colour scheme of Flight Lieutenant Tony Cooper's 64 Squadron Mk Vb 'SH-F' (BM327) \"PeterJohn1\" (named after his new-born son).\nThe Mk LFIXe Spitfire, MK356, was built in March 1944 and fitted with a Merlin 66 engine with a two-speed, two-stage supercharger optimised for low altitudes. Allocated to the Royal Canadian Air Force 144 wing, based in various locations around southern England, she took part in the Rodeo fighter sweep over occupied France in the weeks leading up to D-Day. After the war she served as a gate guardian at Hawkinge and Locking, and was recovered and refurbished in 1992 for the BBMF. As of 2017, she is displayed in a desert paint scheme used by No. 92 Squadron in Tunisia in 1943.\n\nThere are also two PRXIX Spitfires, both built in 1945 with Griffon 66 engines. PM631 was too late to see operational services in World War II and carried out civilian duties with the Temperature and Humidity Monitoring Flight (THUM) at RAF Woodvale until 11 July 1957, when she became part of the Historic Aircraft Flight; she is the longest-serving aircraft in the BBMF and is currently painted to represent a 541 Squadron Spitfire.\nPS915 performed various reconnaissance duties at Wunsdorf in Germany. She returned to the UK in 1954 and was retired to gate guarding duties. In 1987 she was modified with a Griffon 58 engine and refurbished to flying condition by British Aerospace. She currently carries the markings of PS888 of 81 Squadron based at Seletar, Singapore, during the Malayan Emergency which conducted the last operational RAF Spitfire sortie on 1 April 1954, photographing communist guerrilla hideouts over an area of jungle in Johore. The ground crew painted the inscription \"The Last!\" on PS 915's left engine cowling.\n\nOne Mark XIX Spitfire, PS853, was sold in 1994 to defray the costs of rebuilding Hurricane LF363 after her crash-landing on the runway at RAF Wittering due to engine failure in 1991. The BBMF pilot escaped with a broken ankle and minor bruises, whilst LF363 was engulfed and devastated by the resulting fire.\n\nSpitfire Mark XVI TE311, built as a low-back with clipped wings and powered with a Packard Merlin engine, was acquired in 2002 and initially allocated for spares, but officially added to the BBMF collection in 2007. TE311 was made airworthy in the later stages of the 2012 display season. TE311 is currently painted as the personal aircraft of Gp Capt Aleksander Gabszewicz, the Officer Commanding No. 131 (Polish) Wing.\n\nThere are two Hurricanes. LF363 is a Mk IIc and the last Hurricane to have entered service with the RAF. She appeared in the films \"Angels One Five\", \"Reach for the Sky\", \"The Battle of Britain\", and a TV series \"The War in the Air\". PZ865, is a Mk IIc built six months after LF363; she is the last Hurricane ever to have been built. She once wore the inscription \"The last of the Many\" on her port and starboard sides - the original fabric with this inscription is now located in the BBMF Headquarters at RAF Coningsby.\n\nThe Lancaster bomber - PA474, acquired by the BBMF in 1973, is one of only two surviving airworthy examples of the type; the other is in Canada. She was built in mid-1945 and assigned to reconnaissance duties after appearing too late to take part in the bombing of Japan. After various duties, she was adopted by the Air Historical Branch for display work. She appeared in two films: \"Operation Crossbow\" and \"The Guns of Navarone\". Having been flown for much of her service with the BBMF as the \"City of Lincoln\", PA474 previously wore the markings of the \"Phantom of the Ruhr\", a Lancaster that flew 121 sorties (a so-called \"ton-up\" Lancaster). Originally assigned to 100 Squadron in June 1943, the original \"Phantom\" was transferred to 101 Squadron in November that year and finished the war as part of 550 Squadron at Ludford Magna. The Lancaster currently carries the markings of AR-L 'Leader', which served with No 460 Squadron (RAAF). \nPA474 displays the markings of bombs for operations over Germany, ice-cream cones for operations over Italy and poppies when she releases poppies during exhibition flights. During the 2008 RAF Waddington Air Day, PA474 was flown in formation with the recently restored Avro Vulcan XH558 in an historic display of two Avro \"heavy metal\" classics.\n\nThe Dakota, ZA947, built at Long Beach, California in March 1942, was issued to the US Army Air Forces and later transferred to the Royal Canadian Air Force where she served until 1971. The aircraft was purchased by the Royal Aircraft Establishment before being issued to the BBMF in March 1993. She is equipped with authentic period 'para seats' and is used in commemorative parachute drops.\n\nThe Dakota did serve solely as a support aircraft for the flight and as a multi-engine tail-wheel trainer for the Lancaster; but recently she has also acted as a display aircraft in her own right. ZA947 is becoming increasingly popular with the public and 2013 saw the aircraft making many appearances.\n\nThe two Chipmunks (WG486 and WK518), are the last in RAF service, but are not intended for display use; rather, they serve to give pilots experience in flying aircraft with a tailwheel landing gear, a design that has now vanished from the modern RAF fleet. Chipmunk WG486 flew reconnaissance missions over East Germany, as part of the RAF Gatow Station Flight, in co-operation with the British Commander-in-Chief's Mission to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, commonly known as BRIXMIS.\n\nThe flight also regularly takes part in combined flypasts with other recognisable British aircraft, such as the Red Arrows. It appeared on occasion with Concorde before that aircraft's withdrawal from service in October 2003.\n\nFor much of the 2014 display season the flight was joined by Canadian built Lancaster B Mk X FM213. This aircraft is owned and operated by the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum and made the 3,000-mile trip to the UK, via Goose Bay and Keflavik arriving at RAF Coningsby on 9 August. FM213 (C-GVRA) is dedicated to the memory of P/O Andrew Mynarski VC and is referred to as the \"Mynarski Memorial Lancaster\". It is painted in the colours of his aircraft KB726 – VR-A, which flew with RCAF No. 419 (Moose) Squadron, and is affectionately known as Vera. She displayed with PA474 in the first Lancaster two-aircraft formation for 50 years, with both Lancasters visiting a large number of air shows and events before Vera's departure back to Canada in mid-September.\n\nIn the years following World War II it became traditional for a Spitfire and Hurricane to lead the Victory Day flypast over London. From that event there grew the idea to form a historic collection of flyable aircraft, initially to commemorate the RAF's major battle honour, the Battle of Britain, and latterly with broadened scope, to commemorate the RAF's involvement in all the campaigns of World War II. Thus in 1957 the Historic Aircraft Flight was formed at RAF Biggin Hill with one Hurricane (LF363) and three Mk XIX Spitfires (PM631, PS853 and PS915), in what, even then, had become a predominantly jet-powered air force. \nThere is evidence that at least one of the Spifires sometimes flew with a single Hawker Hunter F5 of 41 Sqn (the last operational squadron to operate from RAF Biggin Hill) which co-resided with the Spitfires and Hurricane at that time. The two aircraft together were referred to in an official Biggin Hill \"At Home\" Day Display programme as the 'Battle of Britain Flight'.\n\nOriginally the RAF Historic Aircraft Flight, with a small group of Spitfires and Hurricanes operating from RAF Coltishall from 1963, the group became the \"Battle of Britain Memorial Flight\" in 1973, with the acquisition of the Lancaster.\n\nBBMF moved to its present home at RAF Coningsby in 1976, since then it has acquired several more aircraft including, the first Chipmunk acquired in 1983, a Dakota was originally acquired in 1995, as a more reliable multi-engine trainer than the De Havilland Devon, that was nicknamed the 'Devon State Two', due to its tendency to return to the ground on an emergency state two; but has since taken a fuller role in BBMFs line up. The Spitfires and Hurricanes in the flight have varied over the years, as new aircraft are acquired and older ones passed to museums or used for parts.\n\nOver the years the BBMF have called many RAF bases \"home\". These include: Biggin Hill July 1957–March 1958, North Weald March–May 1958, Martlesham Heath May 1958–November 1961, Horsham St Faith November 1961–April 1963, Coltishall April 1963–March 1976 and RAF Coningsby since March 1976.\n\nAircraft currently in the flight have served with the RAF, the United States Army Air Forces, and the Royal Canadian Air Force, as well as having been privately owned; whilst in the RAF, they were flown by Czechoslovakian, Polish, South African, American and Canadian pilots. Some were sold for scrapping and later saved, whilst at least one has been on operational service with the RAF for almost fifty years.\n\nThe Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Visitor Centre is located at RAF Coningsby in Coningsby, Lincolnshire. A partnership between the Royal Air Force and Lincolnshire County Council, the centre allows visitors an up-close guided tour of the aircraft when not in use, as well as exhibits about the aircraft and other temporary exhibits.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2163891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163891", "title": "Padang, Singapore", "text": "Padang, Singapore\n\nThe Padang (Malay for 'field') is an open playing field located within the Downtown Core of the Central Area in Singapore. It includes the Padang Cricket Ground. The Padang is surrounded by several important landmarks, which include Saint Andrew's Cathedral, City Hall, the Old Supreme Court Building and the City Hall MRT station.\n\nDue to its prime location and historical significance, it has been used as a venue for a variety of events, including the National Day Parades some years due to the first ever National Day Parade being held there in 1966, the recently-held Singapore's Golden Jubilee Year in 2015, and later in 2019 honouring the bicentennial anniversary since the founding of modern Singapore in 1819. Since 1995, it has been planned that the NDP would be held there for every five years, the main venue for that major event is at The Float @ Marina Bay (previously the Former National Stadium). On 4 November 2018, Padang hosted the live finals of the Chinese-Mandopop singing reality competition \"SPOP Sing!\".\n\nOn 3 August 2019, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced that the Padang will be gazetted as a National Monument along with the Anderson Bridge, Cavenagh Bridge and the Elgin Bridge (collectively known as the Singapore River Bridges), which were gazetted on 15 October that year.\n\nIn June 1819, modern founder of Singapore, Thomas Stamford Raffles instructed the first Resident of Singapore, William Farquhar, to reserve the whole space within the Old Lines and the Singapore River (i.e. the northern bank) for public purposes. However, Farquhar found it expedient to allow European merchants to encroach the reserved space as this appeared to be the only suitable site for mercantile firms and godowns, since the southern bank was then too swampy. Farquhar also built a temporary home with an \"attap\" roof and kajang walls on the current Singapore Cricket Club site, on the edge which came to be known as Raffles Plain. When Raffles returned to the island in October 1822, Raffles disapproved of the encroaching by mercantile interests of land he had set aside for public use. Raffles immediately countermanded Farquhar's permits, put a stay on all buildings in the area and appointed a committee with strict and explicit instructions on how he wanted the town of Singapore to be planned. As the Esplanade plan had been broken, it was necessary to designate a new site for the town's public buildings. The area chosen was the Padang Besar or simply the Padang, as it is known today.\n\nDuring the 1820s, there were four houses that faced the Padang, what is now the Old Supreme Court Building were two houses built in 1823 houses of Edward Boustead, and the site of the City Hall formerly the houses of Resident Councillor Thomas Church and William Montgomerie who was Residency Surgeon. In 1845, Gaston Dutronquoy moved into the Boustead houses and converted into his second London Hotel. The place became Hotel de l'Esperance and later Hotel de l'Europe and was demolished in the year 1900. The Grand Hotel de l'Europe was built in 1905 and demolished in 1935 due to financial problems. The hotel made way for the Old Supreme Court Building which was the last Classical architecture building built in Singapore. The statue of Stamford Raffles was unveiled at the plain on 27 June 1877, but it was moved to Victoria Memorial Hall (now Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall) on 6 December 1919.\n\nIn the past, Padang was referred as The Plain, Cantonment Plain, Raffles Plain or the Esplanade. In modern times, Esplanade refers to the cultural centre known as Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay and before that the Esplanade Park. Today, the Padang is a field located between two clubs in front of City Hall. After Raffles' founding of Singapore, this was where the Sepoy Cantonment was first located (hence the name Cantonment Plain), before the sepoys were shifted to Cantonment Road/Sepoy Lines area. Around 1890, the Esplanade was widened by reclaiming land, and constructed a road known as New Esplanade Road (now Connaught Drive). In 1907, the area became known as the Padang and the roads in that area were renamed. Esplanade Road was renamed St. Andrew's Road and New Esplanade Road was known as Connaught Drive. Before reclamation, the sea shore was where Connaught Drive is currently located. Near the current Singapore Recreation Club, was a Saluting Battery mounted on a knoll, which was known in the early days as a Scandal Point. The paintings of the Esplanade by J. T. Thomson in 1847 and 1851 were done at this point. The Padang was threatened to be used for development several times but it was abandoned due to public outcry.\n\nSurprisingly, the administration sector of the Padang area began to take shape only in the late 1920s, replacing houses built by G.D. Coleman. The Grand Hotel de l'Europe was demolished and made way for the courthouse in 1936. Today, the Padang is used for many events such as the National Day Parade. The Padang was where the victory parade of the Japanese surrendering Singapore back to the British, and the surrender forces by Lord Louis Mountbatten ending World War II in Singapore. The Padang is used for sports such as soccer, cricket and rugby.\n\nThe Padang became a major recreational area when two clubs, the Singapore Cricket Club in 1870 and the Singapore Recreation Club in 1883 were established at both ends of the field. It was used for exercising horses in the 1920s and became the scene for the New Year sporting activities.\n\n"}

{"id": "2163907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163907", "title": "Chiemgauer", "text": "Chiemgauer\n\nChiemgauer is a regional local currency started in 2003 in Prien am Chiemsee, Bavaria, Germany. Named after the Chiemgau, a region around the Chiemsee lake, it is intended to increase local employment, supporting local culture, and make the local food supply more resilient. The Chiemgauer operates with a fixed exchange rate, tied to the value of the euro: 1 Chiemgauer = €1.\n\nIn 2003, Christian Gelleri, a high school teacher, started this project with his students, who are in charge of designing and printing vouchers and take care of administration, accounting, advertising, and other tasks. Chiemgauer is a member of a regional currencies' network called Regiogeld (regiomoney association). Gelleri had been inspired by the economists Silvio Gesell and Rudolf Steiner.\n\nThe Chiemgauer is intended for:\n\nIn 2006, an electronic form of the Chiemgauer, the \"eChiemgauer\", was established. Bank accounts are used for operations; this has been made possible through cooperation with cooperative and local banks. Only businesses and nonprofits need additional electronic accounts, while consumers have the possibility to use electronic cards called \"Regiocard\". Two-thirds of Chiemgauer turnover is electronic. The demurrage is 6% per year (between 2003 and 2015: 8%).\n\nChiemgauer use has grown and can be found primarily in Bavaria between Munich, Germany, and Salzburg, Austria (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland combined had 30 regional currency systems as of 2009).\n\nChiemgauer, whose value is fixed to the euro, circulates as follows within the districts of Rosenheim and Traunstein:\n\nBills of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 Chiemgauer are issued. To maintain an individual bill's validity, a \"scrip\" corresponding to 2% of the banknote value must be paid every three months. This system, called demurrage, is a form of currency circulation tax invented by Silvio Gesell. Specifically:\n\n...in order to prevent this complementary currency from degenerating into a means of hoarding and to confer it on high liquidity. It is required to put a stamp of 2% of the face value (€0.10 for 5 Chiemgauer, for instance) every three months to keep it valid, obliging its bearers to give up hoarding this complementary currency and to spend it as soon as possible and stimulating consequently the regional economy.\n\nBecause it loses value every quarter, users are incentivized to spend the money. The notes have an expiry date after which they need to be renewed with a sticker costing 2% of their value. The quicker money is spent, the faster, in macroeconomic terms, its velocity. Gesell argued that a higher velocity of money helps combat deflation.\n\nThere are different rules for nonprofits and businesses. Nonprofits can purchase 100 Chiemgauer at €97, potentially increasing the value of their money by 3%. On the other hand, businesses that accept Chiemgauer are subject to 5% commission fee if they want to change it back to euros, which incentivizes them to work within the system and also potentially increase Chiemgauer users by, for example, getting local suppliers to accept payments in Chiemgauer.\n\nSince 2007, Chiemgauer could be saved without interest at a social cooperative called REGIOS. Likewise, a microcredit program for businesses and nonprofits has existed since 2010 and loans are available in amounts ranging from €1,000 to €20,000. Interest is calculated at a rate of 9%, but when a loan issued in Chiemgauer is paid back on time and without fault, the entire interest costs are paid back to the debtor.\n\n"}

In 1793, on the outbreak of the war with France, he accompanied Sir Charles Grey on campaign to the West Indies in command of a battalion of light infantry, formed from the light companies of the various regiments in the expedition, and greatly distinguished himself throughout the operations there, and especially at the storming of the Morne Fortuné in Guadeloupe, for which he was thanked in general orders.\n\nCoote was promoted colonel on 24 January 1794, and returned with Sir Ralph Abercromby in 1795 to the West Indies, where he again distinguished himself, and for his services was made an aide-de-camp to King George III. In 1796 he was made a brigadier-general, and appointed to command the camp at Bandon in Ireland, and on 1 January 1798 he was promoted major-general, and shortly after given the important command of Dover.\n\nAs Coote held the Dover post he was appointed to command the troops employed in the expedition which had been planned by Sir Home Popham to cut the sluices at Ostend, and thus flood that part of the Netherlands which was then in the possession of the French. The troops were only thirteen hundred in number, and were successfully disembarked and cut the sluices as proposed on 18 May. A high wind off the land then sprang up, and the ships could not come in to take the troops off. French troops were hurried up, and the small English force was completely hemmed in, and after a desperate resistance, in which he lost six officers and 109 men killed and wounded, Coote, who was himself severely wounded, was forced to surrender. He was soon exchanged, and then returned to his command at Dover, but was summoned from it in 1799 to command a division in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland.\n\nCoote's and Don's division formed Sir James Pulteney's column in the fierce battle of Bergen, but the successes of Pulteney's and Abercromby's columns could not make up for the failure of the rest, and the Frederick, Duke of York had to sign the Convention of Alkmaar.\n\nIn 1800 Coote was appointed to command a brigade in the Mediterranean, and bore his part in the disembarkation of Sir Ralph Abercromby in Egypt and in the battles there of 8, 13, and 21 March. When Sir John Hutchinson, who succeeded Sir Ralph Abercromby, commenced his march to Cairo, Coote was left in command before Alexandria, and conducted the blockade of that city from April to August 1801. Coote appears as one of the Heroes of the Egypt Campaign in a commemorative engraving of 1802.\n\nIn the latter month General Hutchinson rejoined the army before Alexandria, and determined to take it. He ordered Coote to take two divisions round to the west of the city, and to attack the castle of Marabout, which commanded it. Victory at the Battle of Alexandria followed; Coote took Marabout after a stubborn resistance, and Alexandria surrendered. His services in Egypt were so conspicuous that Coote was made a knight of the Bath, and also a knight of the new order of the Crescent by the Sultan.\n\nCoote and appointed to command an expedition which was to assemble at Gibraltar for service against South America. This expedition, however, was stopped by the Peace of Amiens, and Coote returned to England, and in 1802 he was elected M.P. for Queen's County, in which he possessed large property inherited from the more famous Sir Eyre Coote (1726–1783). He had already represented, in the Irish House of Commons, Ballynakill (1790–1797) and Maryborough (1797–1800).\n\nHe did not sit long in the House of Commons at this time, for in 1805 he was promoted lieutenant-general, and appointed lieutenant-governor and commander-in-chief of Jamaica. In April 1808 he resigned his government from ill-health, for the West Indian climate greatly tried his constitution and affected his brain.\n\nNevertheless, he was appointed second in command to Lord Chatham in 1809, when the Walcheren expedition was projected, and he superintended all the operations of the siege of Flushing until its surrender. His proceedings, however, were so eccentric during the expedition, that it was obvious that he could never again be trusted with a command.\n\nHe was colonel of the 62nd Foot (1806–1810) and the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot (1810–1816), elected M.P. for Barnstaple in 1812, and promoted general in 1814. His conduct became more and more eccentric, and as \"William Cooper\" describes in his \"History of the Rod. Flagellation and the Flagellants\", In November 1815 he entered Christ's Hospital school for boys and offered some boys money for an opportunity to flog them. After that he asked them to flog him and rewarded them with money. Caught by the school nurse, he was charged for indecent conduct. On 25 November 1815 he was brought up at the Mansion House before the Lord Mayor of London on the charge, and acquitted after \"donating\" £1000 to the school. \n\nAlthough the case had been dismissed, the Duke of York, the commander-in-chief of the British Army, heard of these proceedings, and, in spite of strong representations from many distinguished officers, he directed Sir John Abercromby, Sir Henry Fane, and Sir George Cooke to report upon the matter. These three generals, after a long inquiry, reported that Coote was eccentric, not mad, and that his conduct had been unworthy of an officer and a gentleman. On 21May 1816 Coote was removed from his regiment, dismissed from the army, and degraded from the Order of the Bath.\n\nCoote lost his seat in parliament at the dissolution of 1818, and died 10December 1823.\n\nHe was twice married: first to Sarah (1765–1795), daughter of John Rodbard, left three daughters – Catherine, Sarah and Susannah; and second to Jane, daughter of Col. John Bagwell, left one son, Eyre Coote. Sarah Rodbard is the subject of one of George Romney's paintings.\n\n\n\n \n"}

Disraeli travelled to Chiefswood (near Melrose) to persuade John Gibson Lockhart (Sir Walter Scott's son-in-law) to edit the paper; Lockhart declined, but agreed to serve as editor of Murray's \"Quarterly Review\" and consult on the management of the paper. Disraeli returned to London and began preparations. Lockhart's suggestion that William Maginn be employed was accepted, and he was sent to Paris as foreign correspondent, where he \"drank much and wrote little.\" Offices were leased in the fashionable West End on Great George Street, distant from both Fleet Street and Grub Street.\n\n\"The Representative\" was launched on 25 January 1826 and apparently never had a proper editor – Disraeli quarrelled with Murray and later satirised him in a novel, \"Vivian Grey\", as the \"Marquess of Carabas.\" The \"Rep's\" politics were incoherent and advertising began slipping away almost immediately. Soon its nickname was the \"demi-Rep.\" Maginn was brought back from Paris in March to try to salvage the paper, but it expired with much finger-pointing in the summer of 1826, and was merged with the \"New Times\". Murray lost heavily (about £26,000) and never attempted another foray into newspaper publishing. Disraeli went on to a career in politics, eventually becoming Prime Minister.\n"}

Sometimes, these calls may:\n\n\nOther times, the news tip may come in the form of a news release, which may either promote an event, meeting, etc.; or alert editors and reporters about an upcoming news conference. Sometimes, assignment editors must sift through hundreds of news releases each day. In many cases, possibly dependent on the market, assignment editors use police scanners, listening to traffic between 911 dispatchers and police officers in the field.\n\nWhatever the case, it is the assignment editor's job to determine what news tips and news releases are the most newsworthy, and then decide which reporter to assign a story to. Those assignments are often determined based on the reporter's experience, skills and his/her beat (e.g., police, courts, schools, city hall, county, etc.).\n\nIf a major story develops – such as a disaster or economic development – an assignment editor may enlist several reporters (in addition to whoever usually covers that beat) to cover various angles of a story. For instance, if the story is about a plant closing, one reporter may be asked to do the main story about the closing, while other reporters may be asked to do stories on such things as employee reaction, reaction from business and community leaders, a history of the plant (and other plant closings, if appropriate), etc.\n\nAn assignment editor often has a minimum of one year of experience working for a particular news organization and a number of years of experience working in journalism, usually as line or copy editor, or even a staff writer. An assignment editor is expected to be well versed in journalistic standards and ethics, and have good knowledge of the community in which he/she works and lives. \n\nThe position is that of a commissioning editor and its responsibilities usually entail the day to day management of staff writers, beat reporters and correspondents, procuring original content from freelance writers, and managing the daily \"budget meeting\". Sometimes, it may be a journalist's first job as a senior editor in the newsroom, working with other editorial sections – such as copy, opinion, magazine, managing and chief editors – alongside the breaking news desk. As more news outlets move to a digital first model, the role has changed substantially, with the emphasis shifting from page planning to commissioning time sensitive pieces that fit a more rapid news cycle.\n\nAt many smaller daily and weekly newspapers, the role of assignment editor is often combined with an editor's other duties (e.g., an assistant editor who also lays out the pages also may be asked to assign stories to reporters).\n\n"}

John Bayton, George Morgan, and George Croghan, deputy superintendent of Indian affairs, joined in a partnership on the Ohio country and Indian Trade after 1763. Though the various colonies laid claim to parts of it after the French and Indian War, the Treaty of Paris gave control of the entire Ohio region to Great Britain of Wharton and their business operation. During the American Revolution, he served as a delegate to the Continental Congress from Delaware.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Wharton was the son of Joseph Wharton, a successful merchant. He was a first cousin to Thomas Wharton, Jr., who was the revolutionary President of Pennsylvania. Though Samuel later made his home in Dover, he always maintained close business connections with the city, where he was a partner in the mercantile firm of Baynton, Wharton and Morgan. He married Sarah Lewis of New Castle in 1754. They would have four children that survived infancy.\n\nIn 1768 Wharton attended the negotiations leading to the Treaty of Fort Stanwix. There Wharton represented a group of merchants, known as the \"suffering traders\", who had had trade goods destroyed during the French and Indian War and Pontiac's Rebellion (Marshall 1965:717). As compensation for their losses, the Iroquois granted the \"suffering traders\" a tract of land making up about a fourth of modern West Virginia. This land, known as Indiana—unrelated to the later state of the same name-would cause him nothing but trouble for the next twenty years.\n\nWhen the Revolutionary War broke out, Wharton was in London working to secure the crown's approval for the land grant. When some of his letters to rebels were made public, he was forced to flee to France. He was finally able to return to America in 1780, and took an oath of allegiance to the American cause on February 9, 1781.\n\nIn 1782 and 1783 Wharton was a delegate to the Continental Congress. Many of his efforts there seem to have been quiet negotiations aimed at gaining recognition for his western land holdings. These did not avail, and he returned to Delaware. The entire claim came to naught when the Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance in 1787. Pennsylvania, New York, and Delaware ceded all western claims, and his tract was confirmed as part of Virginia.\n\nWharton served two years as a state court judge in Delaware before retiring to a country estate just outside Philadelphia, where he died in March 1800.\n\nMarshall, Peter, \" 'Lord Hillsborough, Samuel Wharton and the Ohio Grant, 1769-1775' \", The English Historical Review © 1965 Oxford University Press, Stable URL: (article consists of 23 pages).\n\n"}

Regarded as one of the premier workers of his era, O'Connor held the AWA World Heavyweight Championship and NWA World Heavyweight Championship simultaneously, the latter of which he held for approximately two years. He was also the inaugural AWA World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nPatrick John O'Connor was born on 22 August 1924 in Raetihi, New Zealand, to parents John Frederick and Isabella. While he attended high school at Feilding Agricultural High School, he also helped tend to the sheep and cattle on his parents' farm. He later attended Massey Agricultural College, and later served for six months in the New Zealand Royal Air Force in 1945.\n\nBefore entering the world of professional wrestling, O'Connor was an amateur wrestler. He trained under Dave Sparrow, and later Don Anderson, while working as a blacksmith to pay the bills. After a tournament in 1947, he joined the Wellington wrestling team and trained under Anton Koolmann. In 1948, he represented New Zealand in the Pan American games. O'Connor won the New Zealand Heavyweight Championship in amateur wrestling in both 1949 and 1950. The 1949 win earned him entry into the 1950 British Empire Games. At the Empire Games, O'Connor, once again representing New Zealand, won a silver medal winner in the (freestyle) heavyweight division. He later trained to be a professional wrestler under Len Levy.\n\nOn 19 March 1955, O'Connor won the NWA World Tag Team Championship (Chicago version) with tag team partner Roy McClarity, and they held the title until February 1956. Later in the year, he worked for Maple Leaf Wrestling. In March, he won the NWA British Empire Heavyweight Championship (Toronto version), but lost it on 2 May 1957 to Gene Kiniski. That same month, O'Connor and Whipper Billy Watson won the NWA Canadian Open Tag Team Championship, but lost it to Gene Kiniski and Fritz Von Erich on 31 October of that year.\n\nO'Connor held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from 1959 to 1961. He first won the title on 9 January 1959 from Dick Hutton, who had held the title for thirteen months. O'Connor's reign was recognized by both the National Wrestling Alliance and the National Wrestling Association. The title change was part of the rivalry between bookers Sam Muchnick and Fred Kohler, the latter of whom did not want to waste any money announcing O'Connor as the new champion. Kohler also wanted O'Connor to pay him $10,000 to wrestle at shows in Chicago, while being paid less than champions usually earned. O'Connor was so angry at the suggestion that he walked out of their meeting and later told Muchnick not to book him for events in Chicago. The men later worked out a deal of sorts, and on 19 February 1960, O'Connor wrestled in Chicago against Bruno Sammartino and Johnny Valentine, among others.\n\nOn 29 July at one of Fred Kohler's events, O'Connor defeated Yukon Eric at an event with an attendance of 30,275. During this time, television also became a factor in the burgeoning market for professional wrestling, and as a result, the demand to trade wrestlers, including O'Connor, throughout the territories, was eased due to Vincent McMahon's Capitol Wrestling. In December, he worked for McMahon in the Northeast. In March 1961, he was suspended for sixteen days when he missed a match in New York. On 30 June 1961, O'Connor dropped the title to Buddy Rogers in front of 38,622 fans at Comiskey Park, a North American professional wrestling attendance record that lasted until Toronto's The Big Event in 1986. The ticket sells of $148,000 was a professional wrestling record for almost twenty years. The match, a two out of three falls match, was billed as the \"Match of the Century\". During the match, both men had gained a pinfall, when O'Connor missed a dropkick and suffered a legit groin injury on the ropes, after which Rogers pinned him to win the match.\n\nIn May 1960, while still the NWA World Heavyweight Champion, the American Wrestling Association (AWA) named O'Connor as the first holder of the AWA World Heavyweight Championship when they seceded from the NWA. Therefore, he held both the AWA and NWA World Heavyweight Championships simultaneously. However, he never defended the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, and was stripped of it in August, after ninety days, when Verne Gagne was recognized as the new champion.\n\nOn 10 November 1967, the team of O'Connor and Wilbur Snyder defeated Larry Hennig and Harley Race to win the AWA World Tag Team Championship. They lost the title on 2 December to Mitsu Arakawa and Dr. Moto. O'Connor and Snyder also defeated Arakawa and Moto for the World Wrestling Association's WWA World Tag Team Championship on 24 September 1968. They lost the title on 26 October to the same team.\n\nOn 13 October 1970, O'Connor was introduced as Jim Crockett Promotions's first NWA Eastern States Heavyweight Champion as part of a storyline to introduce the title. The title was later awarded to the Missouri Mauler with the announcement that Mauler won it in New York.\n\nOn 1 January 1982, O'Connor was part of the card that comprised promoter Sam Muchnick's last professional wrestling show, located in St. Louis. O'Connor was also one of the owners of the St. Louis Wrestling Club. O'Connor, along with Verne Gagne, Harley Race, and Bob Geigel purchased the territory from Sam Muchnick the day after Muchnick's retirement. On 18 September 1963, O'Connor was named as a co-conspirator in the monopoly that controlled professional wrestling in Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa. O'Connor filed a counterclaim.\n\nOn 16 November 1987, O'Connor participated in a World Wrestling Federation \"old-timers\" battle royal, which was won by Lou Thesz.\n\nO'Connor died of cancer on 16 August 1990.\n\nIn December 1990, World Championship Wrestling held the Pat O'Connor Memorial International Cup Tag Team Tournament, an eight-team international tag team memorial tournament at Starrcade in honor of O'Connor. In 1996, he was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame. In 2007, the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame inducted O'Connor. He is also a member of the Stampede Wrestling Hall of Fame. In 2016, O'Connor became a \"Legacy\" member of the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2163963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163963", "title": "Air traffic control radar beacon system", "text": "Air traffic control radar beacon system\n\nThe air traffic control radar beacon system (ATCRBS) is a system used in air traffic control (ATC) to enhance surveillance radar monitoring and separation of air traffic. It consists of a rotating ground antenna and transponders in aircraft. The ground antenna sweeps a narrow vertical beam of microwaves around the airspace. When the beam strikes an aircraft, the transponder transmits a return signal back giving information such as altitude and the Squawk Code, a four digit code assigned to each aircraft that enters a region. Information about this aircraft is then entered into the system and subsequently added to the controller's screen to display this information when queried. This information can include flight number designation and altitude of the aircraft. ATCRBS assists air traffic control (ATC) surveillance radars by acquiring information about the aircraft being monitored, and providing this information to the radar controllers. The controllers can use the information to identify radar returns from aircraft (known as \"targets\") and to distinguish those returns from ground clutter.\n\nThe system consists of transponders, installed in aircraft, and secondary surveillance radars (SSRs), installed at air traffic control facilities. The SSR is sometimes co-located with the primary surveillance radar, or PSR. These two radar systems work in conjunction to produce a synchronized surveillance picture. The SSR transmits interrogations and listens for any replies. Transponders that receive an interrogation decode it, decide whether to reply, and then respond with the requested information when appropriate. Note that in common informal usage, the term \"SSR\" is sometimes used to refer to the entire ATCRBS system, however this term (as found in technical publications) properly refers only to the ground radar itself.\n\nAn ATC ground station consists of two radar systems and their associated support components. The most prominent component is the PSR. It is also referred to as \"skin paint radar\" because it shows not synthetic or alpha-numeric target symbols, but bright (or colored) blips or areas on the radar screen produced by the RF energy reflections from the target's \"skin.\" This is a non-cooperative process, no additional avionic devices are needed. The radar detects and displays reflective objects within the radar's operating range. Weather radar data is displayed in skin paint mode. The primary surveillance radar is subject to the radar equation that says signal strength drops off as the fourth power of distance to the target. Objects detected using the PSR are known as primary targets.\n\nThe second system is the secondary surveillance radar, or SSR, which depends on a cooperating transponder installed on the aircraft being tracked. The transponder emits a signal when it is interrogated by the secondary radar. In a transponder based system signals drop off as the inverse square of the distance to the target, instead of the fourth power in primary radars. As a result, effective range is greatly increased for a given power level. The transponder can also send encoded information about the aircraft, such as identity and altitude.\n\nThe SSR is equipped with a main antenna, and an omnidirectional \"Omni\" antenna at many older sites. Newer antennas (as in the adjacent picture), are grouped as a left and right antenna, and each side connects to a hybrid device which combines the signals into sum and difference channels. Still other sites have both the sum and difference antenna, and an Omni antenna. Surveillance aircraft, e.g. AWACS, have only the sum and difference antennas, but can also be space stabilized by phase shifting the beam down or up when pitched or rolled. The SSR antenna is typically fitted to the PSR antenna, so they point in the same direction as the antennas rotate. The omnidirectional antenna is mounted near and high, usually on top of the radome if equipped. Mode-S interrogators require the sum and difference channels to provide the monopulse capability to measure the off-boresight angle of the transponder reply.\n\nThe SSR repetitively transmits interrogations as the rotating radar antenna scans the sky. The interrogation specifies what type of information a replying transponder should send by using a system of modes. There have been a number of modes used historically, but four are in common use today: mode 1, mode 2, mode 3/A, and mode C. Mode 1 is used to sort military targets during phases of a mission. Mode 2 is used to identify military aircraft missions. Mode 3/A is used to identify each aircraft in the radar's coverage area. Mode C is used to request/report an aircraft's altitude.\n\nTwo other modes, mode 4 and mode S, are not considered part of the ATCRBS system, but they use the same transmit and receive hardware. Mode 4 is used by military aircraft for the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system. Mode S is a discrete selective interrogation, rather than a general broadcast, that facilitates TCAS for civilian aircraft. Mode S transponders ignore interrogations not addressed with their unique identity code, reducing channel congestion. At a typical SSR radar installation, ATCRBS, IFF, and mode S interrogations will all be transmitted in an interlaced fashion. Some military facilities and/or aircraft will also utilize Mode S.\n\nReturns from both radars at the ground station are transmitted to the ATC facility using a microwave link, a coaxial link, or (with newer radars) a digitizer and a modem. Once received at the ATC facility, a computer system known as a radar data processor associates the reply information with the proper primary target and displays it next to the target on the radar scope.\n\nThe equipment installed in the aircraft is considerably simpler, consisting of the transponder itself, usually mounted in the instrument panel or avionics rack, and a small L band UHF antenna, mounted on the bottom of the fuselage. Many commercial aircraft also have an antenna on the top of the fuselage, and either or both antennas can be selected by the flight crew.\n\nTypical installations also include an altitude encoder, which is a small device connected to both the transponder and the aircraft's static system. It provides the aircraft's pressure altitude to the transponder, so that it may relay the information to the ATC facility. The encoder uses 11 wires to pass altitude information to the transponder in the form of a Gillham Code, a modified binary Gray code.\nThe transponder has a small required set of controls and is simple to operate. It has a method to enter the four-digit transponder code, also known as a \"beacon code\" or \"squawk code\", and a control to transmit an \"ident\", which is done at the controller's request (see SPI pulse below). Transponders typically have 4 operating modes: Off, Standby, On (Mode-A), and Alt (Mode-C). On and Alt mode differ only in that the On mode inhibits transmitting any altitude information. Standby mode allows the unit to remain powered and warmed up but inhibits any replies, since the radar is used for searching the aircraft and exact location of aircraft.\n\nThe steps involved in performing an ATCRBS interrogation are as follows: First, the ATCRBS interrogator periodically interrogates aircraft on a frequency of 1030 MHz. This is done through a rotating or scanning antenna at the radar's assigned Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF). Interrogations are typically performed at 450 - 500 interrogations/second. Once an interrogation has been transmitted, it travels through space (at the speed of light) in the direction the antenna is pointing until an aircraft is reached.\n\nWhen the aircraft receives the interrogation, the aircraft transponder will send a reply on 1090 MHz after a 3.0 μs delay indicating the requested information. The interrogator's processor will then decode the reply and identify the aircraft. The range of the aircraft is determined from the delay between the reply and the interrogation. The azimuth of the aircraft is determined from the direction the antenna is pointing when the first reply was received, until the last reply is received. This window of azimuth values is then divided by two to give the calculated \"centroid\" azimuth. The errors in this algorithm cause the aircraft to jitter across the controllers scope, and is referred to as \"track jitter.\" The jitter problem makes software tracking algorithms problematic, and is the reason why monopulse was implemented.\n\nInterrogations consist of three pulses, 0.8 μs in duration, referred to as P1, P2 and P3. The timing between pulses P1 and P3 determines the mode (or question) of the interrogation, and thus what the nature of the reply should be. P2 is used in side-lobe suppression, explained later.\n\nMode 3/A uses a P1 to P3 spacing of 8.0 μs, and is used to request the \"beacon code\", which was assigned to the aircraft by the controller to identify it. Mode C uses a spacing of 21 μs, and requests the aircraft's pressure altitude, provided by the altitude encoder. Mode 2 uses a spacing of 5 μs and requests the aircraft to transmit its Military identification code. The latter is only assigned to Military aircraft and so only a small percentage of aircraft actually reply to a mode 2 interrogation.\n\nReplies to interrogations consist of 15 time slots, each 1.45 μs in width, encoding 12 + 1 bits of information. The reply is encoded by the presence or absence of a 0.45 μs pulse in each slot. These are labeled as follows:\n\nF1 C1 A1 C2 A2 C4 A4 X B1 D1 B2 D2 B4 D4 F2 SPI\n\nThe F1 and F2 pulses are framing pulses, and are always transmitted by the aircraft transponder. They are used by the interrogator to identify legitimate replies. These are spaced 20.3 μs apart.\n\nThe A4, A2, A1, B4, B2, B1, C4, C2, C1, D4, D2, D1 pulses constitute the \"information\" contained in the reply. These bits are used in different ways for each interrogation mode.\n\nFor mode A, each digit in the transponder code (A, B, C, or D) may be a number from zero to seven. These octal digits are transmitted as groups of three pulses each, the A slots reserved for the first digit, B for the second, and so on.\n\nIn a mode C reply, the altitude is encoded by a \"Gillham interface\", Gillham code, which uses Gray code. The Gillham interface is capable of representing a wide range of altitudes, in increments. The altitude transmitted is pressure altitude, and corrected for altimeter setting at the ATC facility. If no encoder is attached, the transponder may optionally transmit only framing pulses (most modern transponders do).\n\nIn a mode 3 reply, the information is the same as a mode A reply in that there are 4 digits transmitted between 0 and 7. The term mode 3 is utilized by the military, whereas mode A is the civilian term.\n\nThe X bit is currently only used for test targets. This bit was originally transmitted by BOMARC missiles that were used as air-launched test targets. This bit may be used by drone aircraft.\n\nThe SPI pulse is positioned 4.35μs past the F2 pulse (3 time slots) and is used as a \"Special Identification Pulse\". The SPI pulse is turned on by the \"identity control\" on the transponder in the aircraft cockpit when requested by air traffic control. The air traffic controller can request the pilot to ident, and when the identity control is activated, the SPI bit will be added to the reply for about 20 seconds (two to four rotations of the interrogator antenna) thereby highlighting the track on the controllers display.\n\nThe SSR's directional antenna is never perfect; inevitably it will \"leak\" lower levels of RF energy in off-axis directions. These are known as side lobes. When aircraft are close to the ground station, the side lobe signals are often strong enough to elicit a reply from their transponders when the antenna is not pointing at them. This can cause \"ghosting\", where an aircraft's target may appear in more than one location on the radar scope. In extreme cases, an effect known as \"ring-around\" occurs, where the transponder replies to excess resulting in an arc or circle of replies centered on the radar site.\n\nTo combat these effects, side lobe suppression (SLS) is used. SLS employs a third pulse, P2, spaced 2μs after P1. This pulse is transmitted from the omnidirectional antenna (or the antenna difference channel) by the ground station, rather than from the directional antenna (or the sum channel). The power output from the omnidirectional antenna is calibrated so that, when received by an aircraft, the P2 pulse is stronger than either P1 or P3, \"except\" when the directional antenna is pointing directly at the aircraft. By comparing the relative strengths of P2 and P1, airborne transponders can determine whether or not the antenna is pointing at the aircraft when the interrogation was received. The power to the difference antenna pattern (for systems so equipped) is not adjusted from that of the P1 and P3 pulses. Algorithms are used in the ground receivers to delete replies on the edge of the two beam patterns.\nTo combat these effects more recently, side lobe suppression (SLS) is still used, but differently. The new and improved SLS employs a third pulse, spaced 2μs either before P3 (a new P2 position) or after P3 (which should be called P4 and appears in the Mode S radar and TCAS specifications). This pulse is transmitted from the directional antenna at the ground station, and the power output of this pulse is the same strength as the P1 and P3 pulses. The action to be taken is specified in the new and improved C74c as:\n\nAny requirement at the transponder to detect and act upon a P2 pulse 2μs after P1 has been removed from the new and improved TSO C74c specification.\n\nMost \"modern\" transponders (manufactured since 1973) have an \"SLS\" circuit which suppresses reply on receipt of any two pulses in any interrogation spaced 2.0 microseconds apart that are above the MTL Minimum Triggering Level threshold of the receiver amplitude discriminator (P1->P2 or P2->P3 or P3->P4). This approach was used to comply with the original C74c and but also complies with the provisions of the new and improved C74c.\n\nThe FAA refers to the non-responsiveness of new and improved TSO C74c compliant transponders to Mode S compatible radars and TCAS as \"The Terra Problem\", and has issued Airworthiness Directives (ADs) against various transponder manufacturers, over the years, at various times on no predictable schedule. The ghosting and ring around problems have recurred on the more modern radars.\n\nTo combat these effects most recently, great emphasis is placed upon software solutions. It is highly likely that one of those software algorithms was the proximate cause of a mid-air collision recently, as one airplane was reported at showing its altitude as the pre-flight paper filed flight plan, and not the altitude assigned by the ATC controller (see the reports and observations contained in the below reference ATC Controlled Airplane Passenger Study of how radar worked).\nSee the reference section below for errors in performance standards for ATCRBS transponders in the US.\n\nSee the reference section below for FAA Technician Study of in-situ transponders.\n\nThe beacon code and altitude were historically displayed verbatim on the radar scope next to the target, however modernization has extended the radar data processor with a flight data processor, or FDP. The FDP automatically assigns beacon codes to flight plans, and when that beacon code is received from an aircraft, the computer can associate it with flight plan information to display immediately useful data, such as aircraft callsign, the aircraft's next navigational fix, assigned and current altitude, etc. near the target in a \"data block\".\nAlthough the ATCRBS does not display aircraft heading.\n\nMode S, or \"mode select\", despite also being called a mode, is actually a radically improved system intended to replace ATCRBS altogether. A few countries have mandated mode S, and many other countries, including the United States, have begun phasing out ATCRBS in favor of this system. Mode S is designed to be fully backward compatible with existing ATCRBS technology.\n\nMode S, despite being called a replacement transponder system for ATCRBS, is actually a data packet protocol which can be used to augment ATCRBS transponder positioning equipment (radar and TCAS).\n\nOne major improvement of Mode S is the ability to interrogate a single aircraft at a time. With old ATCRBS technology, all aircraft within the beam pattern of the interrogating station will reply. In an airspace with multiple interrogation stations, ATCRBS transponders in aircraft can be overwhelmed. By interrogating one aircraft at a time, workload on the aircraft transponder is greatly reduced.\n\nThe second major improvement is increased azimuth accuracy. With PSRs and old SSRs, azimuth of the aircraft is determined by the half split (centroid) method. The half split method is computed by recording the azimuth of the first and last replies from the aircraft, as the radar beam sweeps past its position. Then the midpoint between the start and stop azimuth is used for aircraft position. With MSSR (monopulse secondary surveillance radar) and Mode S, the radar can use the information of one reply to determine azimuth. This is calculated based on the RF phase of the aircraft reply, as determined by the sum and difference antenna elements, and is called monopulse. This monopulse method results in superior azimuth resolution, and removes target jitter from the display.\n\nThe Mode S system also includes a more robust communications protocol, for a wider variety of information exchange. this capability is becoming mandatory across Europe with some states already requiring its use.\n\nDiversity Mode S transponders may be implemented for the purpose of improving air-to-air surveillance and communications. Such systems shall employ two antennas, one\nmounted on the top and the other on the bottom of the aircraft. Appropriate switching and signal processing channels to select the best antenna on the basis of the characteristics of\nthe received interrogation signals shall also be provided. Such diversity systems, in their installed configuration, shall not result in degraded performance relative to that which would have been produced by a single system having a bottom-mounted antenna.\n\nMode S was developed as a solution to frequency congestion on both the uplink and downlink frequencies (1030 and 1090MHz). The high coverage of radar service available today means that some radar sites receive transponder replies from interrogations that were initiated by other nearby radar sites. This results in FRUIT, or \"False Replies Unsynchronous In Time\", which is the reception of replies at a ground station that do not correspond with an interrogation. This problem has worsened with the increasing prevalence of technologies like TCAS, in which individual \"aircraft\" interrogate one another to avoid collisions.\nFinally, technology improvements have made transponders increasingly affordable such that today almost all aircraft are equipped with them. As a result, the sheer number of aircraft replying to SSRs has increased. \"Defruiter\" circuitry clears FRUIT from the display.\n\nMode S attempts to reduce these problems by assigning aircraft a permanent mode S address, derived from the aircraft's internationally assigned registration number. It then provides a mechanism by which an aircraft can be \"selected\", or interrogated such that no other aircraft reply.\n\nThe system also has provisions for transferring arbitrary data both to and from a transponder. This aspect of mode S makes it a building block for many other technologies, such as TCAS 2, Traffic Information Service (TIS), and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, mainstream country music was dominated by the slick Nashville sound and the rock-influenced Bakersfield sound of artists like Merle Haggard. A new generation of country artists emerged, influenced by contemporary rock music, singer-songwriters such as Bob Dylan, and the liberal politics of the 1960s counterculture.\n\nProgressive country was a songwriter-based movement and many key artists had previously seen success writing for other artists in Nashville; writing for themselves, they were more concerned with expanding country music than creating hits. Foremost among these artists was Willie Nelson, who returned to Texas after deciding to focus on performing his own songs. Nelson soon attained a wide following and inspired other artists in Texas and Nashville. KOKE-FM, a radio station in Austin, Texas, introduced a progressive country music format during the early 1970s and continues to feature progressive country music.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, progressive country artists entered the mainstream, usually in the form of cover versions by other artists. Progressive country also provided the basis for outlaw country, a harder-edged, more rock-oriented variant that achieved wide success in the late 1970s, as well as cowpunk and alternative country artists in the 1980s through today.\n\n"}

She is the third female music director to enter the Hindi film industry, after Jaddan Bai and Saraswati Devi and is one of the most commercially successful music directors in the male dominated music industry. She is most known for songs like Hum tum say juda ho ke (ek sapaira ek lutaira, 1965) \"Chhodo kal ki baatein\", \"Shaayad meri shaadi ka khayal\", \"Zindagi pyaar ka geet hai\" and \"Aap to aise na the\". She remained active for more than 3 decades from 1960s to 1980s. She is still active making some music for some movies and television-serials, more than 40 years after her debut as music director in Dil Deke Dekho (1959). She received a Filmfare Award nomination for composing the songs for the huge hit film \"Souten \"(1983). She was married to director, producer, lyricist, Sawan Kumar Tak, from whom she separated later on.\n\nBorn in Gwalior, her father, Manohar Khanna, was a lyricist and singer, working as Assistant Superintendent in the Water Works Department in then Gwalior State. When he came to Bombay (now Mumbai) for some work in 1946 he met Jaddanbai who was mother of Hindi film actress Nargis Dutt. On her request he started writing Gazals for Hindi films by the name, Jaaved Anwar .He was getting a monthly salary of Rs. 250 in Gwalior State and Jaddanabi offered him Rs. 800 for 3 gazals which he wrote for Jaddanbai,s Nargis Art Productions film Romeo Juliet . Usha Khanna did often take inspiration from Arabic music, which she liked and she claims that she has never lifted any song directly, but that she has composed something along the lines.\n\nThe popular music director O. P. Nayyar introduced Usha Khanna to Sashadhar Mukherjee, a powerful man in the Indian film industry at that time. She sang a song for Mukherjee, and when he realised that she had composed the song on her own, he told her to compose two songs per day for one year. After a few months, Mukherjee signed her as the composer for his movie \"Dil Deke Dekho\" (1959) as a music composer. The film, which also introduced the actress Asha Parekh, became a big hit, and Mukherjee hired her again for another Asha Parekh starrer Hum Hindustani (1961).\n\nAfter she started composing music for Hindi movies, Usha Khanna struggled to establish herself as a music director, despite producing many hit songs. She often collaborated with Asha Bhosle, who referred to Usha Khanna as her daughter, and Mohammed Rafi. This trio produced many hit songs. Many of songs sung by Mohammed Rafi under composition of Usha Khanna are still very popular and will be everlasting forever. DIL DEKE DEKHO (1959). HAWAS (1974), SAJAAN KI SAHELI (1981),AAP THO AISE NA THE (1980) as to named a few good songs of movie of Rafi Usha Association. \n\nSaawan Kumar was often the lyricist for Usha Khanna, and wrote most of his lyrics for her songs. He directed and produced the lyrics for eleven movies she scored the music for. In 1979 K. J. Yesudas received Filmfare award for her song \"Dil ke tukde tukde\" in the film Dada. \nUsha Khanna was married to Sawan Kumar Tak but later they separated and she lives in Bombay (present name Mumbai).\n\nThe effort she had put earlier in life to establish herself in the industry, made her realise how difficult it was to break through, and this made her often give the chance to new singers. She gave the chance to the singers who were little known at that time – Anupama Deshpande, Pankaj Udhas, Hemlata, Mohammed Aziz, Roop Kumar Rathod, Shabbir Kumar, and Sonu Nigam. Many of these went on to become notable singers. Usha Khanna herself also sang a few songs as a playback singer.\n\nMany of Usha Khanna's songs are still very popular. Some of the other movies she provided for are 'Shabnam', 'Aankh Micholi', \"Saajan Bina Suhagan\", 'Sautan', 'Sajan ki Saheli', 'Ab Kya Hoga', 'Lal Bungalow', 'Dada', 'Do Khiladi', 'Hanste Khelte'.\n\nUsha Khanna remained quite active as a composer until the mid-nineties. Until now, the last movie she has given music to was in 2003. The movie was Dil Pardesi Ho Gaya, produced and directed by her ex-husband Saawan Kumar who she was briefly married to.\n\nUsha Khanna has given music to non-Hindi movies too. The Malayalam movie Moodal Manju (1969) is still remembered for some of the finest songs in Malayalam including 'Nee Madhu Pakaroo' by K. J. Yesudas and 'Maanasa Mani veenayil' by S.Janaki. Agni nilavu and Puthooram Puthri Unniyarcha are the other Malayalam movies done by her.\n\n"}

This wound ultimately caused his death, although he survived for nearly three years afterwards.\n\nHe married Atiqa bint Zayd, a poet from the Adi clan of the Quraysh. This marriage was childless. It was said that Abdullah respected Atiqa's judgment more than his own and that he spent so much time with her that he neglected his duties to the Islamic state. Abu Bakr punished his son by ordering him to divorce her. Abdullah did as he was told him he was sad\n<poem>\"I have never known a man like me divorce a woman like her,\"\n\"nor any woman like her divorced for no fault of her own.\"</poem>\nIn the end, Abdullah was allowed to take Atiqa back before her waiting period was completed.\n\nAbdullah died in January 633, when his old wound from Ta'if flared up. His wife composed an elegy for him.\n<poem>\"I vow that my soul will remain in sorrow over thee\"\n\"and my skin will remain dusty\".</poem>\n\n"}

He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Hartford Whalers (1984–1990), New York Islanders (1990–1995), New York Rangers (1995–1996), Los Angeles Kings (1996–1999), Atlanta Thrashers (1999–2002) and St. Louis Blues (2002).\n\nFerraro was a prolific scorer in junior hockey, including a 108-goal and 192-point season for the Western Hockey League (WHL)'s Brandon Wheat Kings in 1983–84. He also was a member of the 1982–83 Portland Winter Hawks squad that won the 1983 Memorial Cup. Ferraro's teammates on the championship-winning team included Cam Neely, Mike Vernon, Brian Curran, John Kordic and other future NHLers.\n\nIn his NHL career, he scored 408 goals and 490 assists for a total of 898 points in 1,258 games spanning 18 seasons. He was named to the NHL All-Star Game in 1992, held in Philadelphia. He also had two 40-goal seasons.\n\nFerraro had a memorable Stanley Cup playoff run for the New York Islanders in 1993, scoring two overtime goals against the Washington Capitals as the Islanders defeated both the Capitals and the defending champion Pittsburgh Penguins. Ferraro assisted on David Volek's game- and series-winning goal during overtime of Game 7 against the Penguins. The goal advanced the Islanders to the Wales Conference Finals, which they lost to the eventual champion Montreal Canadiens. Ferraro finished that playoff season with team-leading totals in goals (13) and points (20).\n\nFerraro retired from the NHL on August 2, 2002. He has done work for ESPN hockey broadcasts, including on \"NHL 2Night\" with John Buccigross and Barry Melrose, where he began working while still an active player. On that show, Ferraro was often referred to as \"Chicken Parm\" by Buccigross after an accident with Chicken Parmesan moments before going on the air. He later worked as a studio analyst for the \"NHL on NBC\", as a colour commentator on Edmonton Oilers broadcasts on Rogers Sportsnet West and on Sportsnet's other hockey programs.\n\nFerraro works as a color commentator and studio analyst for the \"NHL on TSN\". Ferraro provided colour commentary and analysis for CTV during the 2010 Winter Olympics. After Pierre McGuire left TSN for NBC/Versus, He became the lead color commentator. After Rogers Media, the parent of TSN's rival Sportsnet, gained the national NHL rights with effect in the 2014-15 NHL season, Ferraro became a color commentator for the network’s regional NHL telecasts, primarily working Toronto Maple Leafs games.\n\nOn May 5, 2014, EA Sports announced that Ferraro would be an \"Inside-the-Glass\" reporter for \"NHL 15\" along with play-by-play commentator Mike Emrick and color commentator Eddie Olczyk. He returned as an \"Inside-the-Glass\" reporter for NHL 16. On November 23, 2015, Ferraro became the first hockey broadcaster to broadcast a game where his child also played in the same game, with the Toronto Maple Leafs hosting the Boston Bruins at the Air Canada Centre..\n\nDuring the 2019 NHL Awards, Ferraro was named as a color commentator in \"NHL 20\". Also in 2019, Ferraro and Darren Dreger started a podcast, \"The Ray and Dregs Hockey Podcast\", hosted by TSN.\n\nFerraro's second wife is former U.S. women's ice hockey team captain Cammi Granato, who also worked as a women's hockey analyst during NBC's 2006 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Olympics coverage. The couple has two sons — Riley, who was born in December 2006, and Reese, born in December 2009. Ferraro also has two sons from a previous marriage to his high-school sweetheart, Tracey Ferraro — Matt, born in 1988, and Landon, born in 1991. Landon, a centre, was drafted second overall by the Red Deer Rebels in the 2006 WHL Bantam Draft and in the second round of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft (32nd overall) by the Detroit Red Wings; he was later traded from Red Deer to the Everett Silvertips, where he was named team captain. Landon made his NHL debut with the Red Wings on March 18, 2014. Matt, a former goaltender, was drafted to the WHL in 2003 by the Prince George Cougars, but has since become a financial planner.\n\nFollowing the Swedish women's team upset of the U.S. at the 2006 Winter Olympic games, Ferraro publicly criticised U.S. women's coach Ben Smith for failing to bring the best U.S. players to the games, which led to the team's downfall. His comments were broadcast on MSNBC during the intermission of a men's game. This appeared to be directly related to his wife being cut in August 2005 because she wouldn't give up her NBC Sports job, along with other veterans in favour of younger, faster players. Some critics and fans also questioned Granato's cut from the team and cited it as a factor in the U.S. team's disappointing performance.\n\nFerraro currently lives in Vancouver, British Columbia. Ferraro played in the 1976 Little League World Series.\n\n\nFerraro is the current color analyst for EA Sports' hockey video games. He was originally between the benches starting in \"NHL 15\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2164076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164076", "title": "Clay pigeon shooting", "text": "Clay pigeon shooting\n\nClay pigeon shooting, also known as clay target shooting, is a shooting sport involving shooting a firearm at special flying targets known as clay pigeons, or clay targets.\n\nThe terminology commonly used by clay shooters often relates to times past, when live-pigeon competitions were held. Although such competitions were made illegal in the United Kingdom in 1921, a target may still be called a \"bird\", a hit may be referred to as a \"kill\", and a missed target as a \"bird away\"; the machine which projects the targets is still known as a \"trap\".\n\nClay targets began to be used in place of live pigeons around 1875. Asphalt targets were later developed, but the name \"clay targets\" stuck. In 1893, the Inanimate Bird Shooting Association was formed in England. It was renamed to the Clay Bird Shooting Association in 1903. It held annual clay-pigeon-shooting contests and lasted until the outbreak of World War I. In 1921, the British parliament passed a bill without opposition making it illegal to shoot birds from traps.\n\nClay pigeon shooting has at least 20 different forms of regulated competition called disciplines, although most can be grouped under the main headings of trap, skeet, and sporting.\n\nThe English Sporting discipline has the sport's biggest following. While the other disciplines only use standard targets, in Sporting almost anything goes. Targets are thrown in a great variety of trajectories, angles, speeds, elevations and distances and the discipline was originally devised to simulate live quarry shooting, hence some of the names commonly used on sporting stands: springing teal, driven pheasant, bolting rabbit, crossing pigeon, dropping duck, etc. Disciplines in this group include English sporting, international (FITASC) sporting, super sporting sportrap, and Compak sporting.\n\nThis discipline can have an infinite variety of \"stands\". English sporting is the most popular form of clay shooting in the UK, and a course or competition will feature a given number of stands each of which has a predetermined number of targets, all traveling along the same path and speed, either as singles or doubles.\n\nEach stand will feature a different type of target; e.g., crosser, driven, quartering, etc. International (FITASC) sporting gives a much greater variety of targets in terms of trajectory and speed, and is shot by squads of six competitors in rounds of 25 targets at a time. Super Sporting is a hybrid of the two preceding varieties. There are also other formats such as Compak sporting and sportrap in which five cages are surrounded by a number of traps, and shooters fire a specific combinations or singles from each stand according to a program displayed in front of the cage.\n\nThis is a new shotgun game that offers sporting clays and FITASC target presentations on a skeet/trap or open field. This is possible by using a movable support system that carries the release buttons (wired or wireless setup) from 6 to 9 traps and the dual safety screen in any place on the field. As a result, the shooter can shoot in safe conditions upon target presentations in varying range (10 to 60 yards) and varying angles (sharp to wide).\n\nTargets are thrown either as singles or doubles from one or more traps situated some 15 m in front of the shooter, and are generally going away from the firing point at varying speeds, angles and elevations. The most common disciplines in this group are:\n\nAlso known as DTL, this is a popular trap shooting discipline. Targets are thrown to a distance of 45 to 50 metres at a fixed height of approximately 2.75 m and with a horizontal spread of up to 22 degrees either side of the centre line. Each competitor shoots at a single target in turn, but without moving from the stand until all have shot five targets. Then they all move one place to the right, and continue to do so until they have all completed a standard round of 25 birds. Scoring of each target is 3 points for a first barrel kill, 2 points for a second barrel kill and 0 for a miss (maximum 75 points per round). Variations of this discipline are single barrel, double rise, and handicap-by-distance.\n\nAs its name indicates, this is one of the disciplines which form part of the shooting programme at the Olympic Games. A trench in front of the shooting stands conceals 15 traps arranged in five groups of three. Shooters take turns to shoot at a target each, before moving in a clockwise direction to the next stand in the line. Targets for each shooter are thrown immediately upon his call and are selected by a shooting scheme (program) that ensures all competitors receive exactly the same target selection, but in an unpredictable randomised order to the extent that there will be one straight, two left and two right targets for each stand from any one of the three traps directly in front of him/her; guessing which one is next is impossible unless the shooter is on his/her last five targets.\n\nOlympic trap targets are set to travel 76 metres (+/-1m) at the top of trench level marker peg, unless the terrain is dead flat, at varying elevations and with a maximum horizontal angle of 45 degrees either side of the centre line (being where the target exits the trench). Scoring is on the basis of one point per target killed, regardless of whether this is achieved with the first or with the second barrel unless it is a final where the top six scorers shoot off as a single barrel event, regardless of local club grades if any.\n\nA simpler and cheaper to install variation of this discipline is known as automatic ball trap (ABT) where only one trap is used and target variation is obtained by the continuous oscillation of the trap in both horizontal and vertical directions in order to give the same spread of targets as in Olympic trap. Similarly, the targets are also thrown to a maximum of 76 metres.\n\nAlso known as Bunker Trap, and International Trap\n\nA variation on the theme of trap shooting, sometimes known as \"five trap\". Five traps are installed in a trench in front of the shooting stands, all set at different angles, elevations and speeds, and upon the call of \"Pull!\" by the shooter any one of the five machines, selected at random, will be released.\n\nHorizontal angles can vary from 0 degrees to 45 degrees either side of the centre line and target distance is between 60 and 70 metres. Elevations can vary, as in other trap disciplines (except DTL), between 1.5 and 3.5 metres above ground level.\n\nThere are 10 different schemes available.\n\nSkeet is a word of Scandinavian origin, though the discipline originated in America. Targets are thrown in singles and doubles from 2 trap houses situated some 40 metres apart, at opposite ends of a semicircular arc on which there are seven shooting positions. The targets are thrown at set trajectories and speeds. The main disciplines in this group are English skeet, Olympic skeet and American (NSSA) skeet.\n\nIn NSSA discipline, targets are released in a combination of singles and doubles, adding up to a total of 25 targets per round, from the High and Low trap houses on a fixed trajectory and speed. Variety is achieved by shooting round the seven stations on the semicircle, followed by an eighth station, located between stations one and seven. Scoring is on the basis of 1 point per target killed, up to a maximum of 25.\n\nIn English skeet (by far the most popular of the skeet disciplines), the gun position is optional (i.e., pre-mounted or out-of-shoulder when the target is called) and the targets are released immediately upon the shooter's call.\n\nIn Olympic skeet, the targets travel at a considerably faster speed, the release of the target can be delayed up to 3 seconds after calling and the gun-down position is compulsory. There is also an eighth shooting station, midway between the two houses.\n\nNSSA and English version of Skeet have the concept of option targets, where the shooter has to repeat the first missed target. In the situation where the first 24 targets are all hit, the last target is considered the option. Here is a representation of Skeet sequences for all variations.\n\nOriginating in Belgium during the 1960s, Electrocibles is similar to trap shooting, but the clays are equipped with a helice that will give the clay an erratic and unpredictable flight. The helice is composed of two winged plastic propellers with a white clay in the centre.\n\nPlastic propellers holding a detachable centre piece are rotated at high speed and released randomly from one of five traps. They fly out in an unpredictable way; so-said buzzing through the air. It is designed specifically to simulate as closely as possible the old sport of live pigeon shooting. Its original name of \"ZZ\" comes from the inventor who made them out of zinc, and had previously shot a specific breed of pigeon called a \"zurito\"; hence the term the \"zinc zurito\". World and European Championships are held every year.\n\nThe targets used for the sport are usually in the shape of an inverted saucer, made from a mixture of pitch and pulverized limestone rock designed to withstand being thrown from traps at very high speeds, but at the same time being easily broken when hit by just a very few lead or steel pellets from a shotgun.\n\nThe targets are usually fluorescent orange or black, but other colours such as white, or yellow are frequently used in order that they can be clearly seen against varying backgrounds and/or light conditions.\n\nTargets are made to very exacting specifications with regard to their weight and dimensions and must conform to set international standards.\n\nThere are several types of targets that are used for the various disciplines, with a standard 108 mm size being the most common used in American Trap, Skeet, and Sporting Clays while International disciplines of these same games use a slightly larger 110 mm diameter size. Only the standard 108/110 mm target is used in all of the trap and skeet disciplines. Sporting shoots feature the full range of targets (except ZZ) to provide the variety that is a hallmark of the discipline.\n\nAll three sports use a shotgun, and in the sporting disciplines are sub-classified by the type of game the clay target represents (pigeon, rabbit, etc.). The two primary methods of projecting clay targets are airborne and ground (rolling).\n\nNaturally, the simplest method of throwing a clay target is by hand, either into the air or along the ground. This method is the simplest, and many \"trick shot\" shooters throw their own targets (some able to throw as many as ten birds up and hit each individually before any land). However, a multitude of devices have been developed to throw the birds more easily and with more consistency. A plastic sling-like device is the simplest, though modern shooting ranges will usually have machines that throw the clay targets in consistent arcs at the push of a button.\n\n\nTraps are purpose-made, spring-loaded, flywheel or rotational devices especially designed to launch the different types of targets in singles or pairs at distances of up to 100 metres.\n\nThese machines vary from the very simple hand-cocked, hand-loaded and hand-released types to the highly sophisticated fully automatic variety, which can hold up to 600 targets in their own magazine and are electrically or pneumatically operated. Target release is by remote control, either by pressing a button or by an acoustic system activated by the shooter's voice.\n\nTarget speeds and trajectories can be easily modified and varied to suit the discipline or type of shooting required.\n\nClay pigeon shooting is performed with a shotgun. The type of shotgun used is often a matter of taste and affected by local laws as well as the governing body of the sport in competitive cases.\n\nAll types of shotguns are suitable for clay pigeon shooting, however the ability to fire multiple shots in quick succession is generally considered important. Some skilled shooters will use a single shot firearm in order to add to the challenge. Traditionally Over and Under and Side by Side shotguns have been popular, however semi-automatic and to a lesser extent pump-action have been making gains, particularly as the cost of reliable, accurate semi-automatics has come down over the last decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShotgun cartridges are readily available in gun shops and at shooting grounds, and within limitations as to the shot size and the weight of the shot load are suitable for clay shooting at CPSA affiliated grounds and for use in events coming under CPSA rules. Though home loaded cartridges allow the user to customize the ballistic characteristics of their shells, they are generally not allowed at clay pigeon shooting events unless specified otherwise.\n\nThe instructions and specifications are printed on the boxes. For clay competition, shot size must not exceed 2.6 mm/English No. 6. The shot load must be a maximum for all domestic disciplines; or for Olympic trap, Olympic skeet, and double trap; up to 28 g for FITASC sporting (from 2005); and for helice.\n\nLaser Clay Pigeon Shooting, also known as Laser Clay Shooting or even Laser Shooting, is a variation on the traditional sport of Clay Pigeon Shooting where the shotguns are disabled and fitted with laser equipment that can detect hits on specially modified reflective clays. Laser clay pigeon shooting offers a safe alternative for beginners.\n\nThe rules and disciplines are normally the same as the traditional sport using live weapons.\n\nThere are four principal pieces of equipment for a laser clay shooting setup: guns, launcher, scoreboard, and clays.\n\nThe activity can be done indoors or outdoors. Just like traditional clay shooting clays are released from a trap and the participants shoot at the flying disc. Unlike traditional clay shooting, multiple participants all shoot at the same disc. In most equipment the register of hits and misses is recorded electronically, and the sounds of the shotgun firing and the clay being hit are played from simulated sounds.\n\nAlthough the activity is similar to traditional clay shooting it does use slightly different shooting principles, some of which are closer to target shooting.\n\n"}

The original Poppy Hills was designed by Robert Trent Jones, Jr., and opened in 1986. Along with Pebble Beach Golf Links and Spyglass Hill Golf Course, Poppy Hills co-hosted the PGA Tour's AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am from 1991 to 2009, replacing Cypress Point in the rotation. Poppy Hills will co-host the Champions Tour's Nature Valley First Tee Open with Pebble Beach for three years, beginning in September of 2014.\n\nPoppy Hills was the first course in the United States to be owned and operated by an amateur golf association, the Northern California Golf Association. Poppy Hills is the headquarters and tournament home of the NCGA, which also owns Poppy Ridge Golf Course in Livermore. Poppy Hills was featured in the original Tiger Woods PGA Tour video game series in 1999, and was an active course through 2004.\n\nThe new Poppy Hills has been widely heralded since it reopened in 2014. Golf.com Travel Writer Joe Passov said the new Poppy Hills has a \"Pinehurst-like touch, with just a hint of near-neighbor Cypress Point.\" Golf Getaways Travel Writer Vic Williams added about the new design, \"at certain times it feels like Pinehurst, other times like Augusta, with dashes of Pine Valley.\"\n\nPoppy Hills is the only course of the seven in Pebble Beach that plays exclusively in the forest. It is also unique because it features no rough and bentgrass greens, both of which are rare on the Monterey Peninsula. The renovation by RTJ II Golf Course Architects reduced the par from 72 to 71, but the yardage increased from 6,863 to 7,002. The entire course was topped with a 5-inch layer of sand, a process called sand capping, which dramatically improves the drainage, fostering firm and fast conditions year-round. All 18 greens were redesigned, reducing the strong undulations that previously existed. While the greens are roughly the same size as before, they are now easier to hit with a low-running shot because of the firmer conditions and elimination of rough. The renovation also softened the sharp doglegs and heavy mounding that previously existed. Naturalized waste areas and pine straw were added throughout the course, bringing the forest more into play while also reducing irrigated turf from 82 acres to 62, which has greatly improved water conservation efforts.\n\nThe 12th hole was converted from a sharp dogleg-right par 5 to a straightaway par 4 that features an elevated tee and a view of the Monterey Bay and Santa Cruz Mountains, changing the par on the back nine from 36 to 35, and the overall par from 72 to 71. The 11th hole is the only brand new hole on the course, as it went from the longest par 3 on the property to the shortest, and plays in the opposite direction. Every hole was changed, but all the others stayed within their same routing.\n\nPoppy Hills also completely renovated its practice facility and clubhouse. The restaurant, Porter's at Poppy Hills, was also reinvented, and is now run by executive chef Johnny De Vivo, formerly of Casanova and La Bicyclette in Carmel. The practice facility is headed by Jeff Ritter, the founder of Make the Turn and a Golf Digest Best Young Teacher.\n\nPoppy Hills replaced Cypress Point Club as one of the host courses of the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in 1991. The switch occurred after the private club did not immediately admit an African-American member, despite the request of the Tour. Poppy Hills last hosted the AT&T National Pro-Am in 2009. The AT&T moved to Monterey Peninsula Country Club's Shore Course in 2010. Matt Gogel set the Poppy Hills course record with a 10-under 62 during the 2001 AT&T.\n\n"}

These songs of different titles are closely related, and two strands in particular became popular in commercial Country music and Folk music recordings of the twentieth century: the \"Silver Dagger\" version popularised by Joan Baez, and the \"Katy Dear\" versions popularised by close harmony brother duets such as The Callahan Brothers, The Blue Sky Boys and The Louvin Brothers.\n\nIn \"Silver Dagger\", the female narrator turns away a potential suitor, as her mother has warned her to avoid the advances of men in an attempt to spare her daughter the heartbreak that she herself has endured. The 1960 recording by Joan Baez features only a fragment of the full ballad. \"Katy Dear\" uses the same melody but different lyrics, telling a similar story from a male perspective.\n\nThe song exists in a large number of variations under many different titles, and with lyrics that may show a mixture of different songs. Steve Roud observes on one version of the song titled \"O! Molly Dear Go Ask Your Mother\":\n\nOf interest are early versions of two songs, \"Silver Dagger\" and \"Drowsy Sleeper\", that are related thematically, but differ in lines, verse rhythm and outcome in their lyrics. The texts of these two songs may share a common origin in the older theme of night visit in traditional English songs. The plot of \"Silver Dagger\" is similar to that of \"Drowsy Sleeper\" whereby the parents object to a match between a boy and a girl, except that in \"Silver Dagger\" the dagger is used as a suicide weapon by the young lovers, while in \"Drowsy Sleeper\" the couple elope. However, at some point in the 19th century, there also appears to have been a fusion of these two different songs whereby the tragic ending of \"Silver Dagger\" becomes attached to \"Drowsy Sleeper\", giving rise to some later variations of the song.\n\nThe earliest known text of \"Drowsy Sleeper\" in Britain may be dated to 1817, and the first verse of a variant of the song appears in a songbook of American folk songs first published in 1855, John G. McCurry's \"The Social Harp\". Early publications of \"Silver Dagger\" in the US may be found in \"Spirit of the Times\" and \"Gazette of the Union, Golden Rule and Odd-fellows' Family Companion\" in 1849. A version of \"Drowsy Sleeper\" published in a broadside as \"Who's at My Bedroom Window?\" by H. J. Wehman in 1890 shows a mixture of \"Silver Dagger\" and \"Drowsy Sleeper\". A version collected in Kentucky was printed in The Journal of American Folk-Lore in 1907, and three versions were collected by Henry M. Belden in 1908. Cecil Sharp published an English version from Somerset in 1908 as \"Arise! Arise!\". Sharp also collected a version of the song in the United States as \"Awake, awake\", sung by Mary Sands in Madison County, North Carolina on August 1, 1916.\n\nThe differences in titles and some lyrics may also be a result of the song being handed down through the unwritten oral tradition, or adapting from different sources, and where each performer may add their own verses and nuances to the song. These songs have been sung using different tunes. Relation to other songs such as \"Old Virginny\"/\"Man of Constant Sorrow\" and \"Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies\" have also been noted.\n\nThe song was recorded commercially as \"O! Molly Dear Go Ask Your Mother\" by Kelly Harrell in 1926, as \"Sleepy Desert\" by Wilmer Watts And The LoneLy Eagles in 1929, and as \"Wake Up You Drowsy Sleeper\" by The Oaks family in 1930. As \"Katie Dear (Silver Dagger)\" it was recorded by the Callahan Brothers in 1934, and as \"Katie Dear\" by the Blue Sky Boys in 1938. (Country music authority Bill C. Malone states that the Callahan Brothers learned traditional ballads like \"Katie Dear\" from their mother). In 1956 it was recorded by the Louvin Brothers. The song was part of the repertoire of the Country Gentlemen, who toured both the bluegrass and folk music circuits during the 1950s and 1960s. In the early 1960s, \"Katie Dear\" was recorded by folk revival musicians, including Joan Baez, and Ian & Sylvia. Today it is commonly performed and recorded by bluegrass musicians.\n\n\nDon't sing love songs; you'll wake my mother\nShe's sleeping here, right by my side\nAnd in her right hand, a silver dagger\nShe says that I can't be your bride.\n\nAll men are false, says my mother\nThey'll tell you wicked, lovin' lies\nThe very next evening, they'll court another\nLeave you alone to pine and sigh.\n\nMy daddy is a handsome devil\nHe's got a chain five miles long\nAnd on every link a heart does dangle\nOf another maid he's loved and wronged.\n\nGo court another tender maiden\nAnd hope that she will be your wife\nFor I've been warned and I've decided\nTo sleep alone all of my life.\n\n\nOh, Katy Dear, go ask your father\nIf you might be a bride of mine\nIf he says yes then come and tell me\nIf he says no, we'll run away.\n\nI cannot go and ask my father\nFor he is on his bed of rest\nAnd by his side there's a golden dagger\nTo pierce the heart I love the best.\n\nOh Katy Dear, go ask your mother\nIf you might be a bride of mine\nIf she says yes then come and tell me\nIf she says no, we'll run away.\n\nI cannot go and ask my mother\nFor she is on her bed of rest\nAnd by her side there's a silver dagger\nTo pierce the heart I love the best.\n\nHe picked up a silver dagger\nHe pierced it through his wounded breast\nFarewell Katy, farewell darling\nI'll die for the one I love the best.\n\nShe picked up the bloody weapon\nShe pierced it through her snow-white breast\nFarewell Momma Farewell Poppa\nI'll go with the one I love the best.\n\nWake up, wake up, you drowsy sleeper,\nWake up, wake up, for its almost day\nStick your head out at the window\nAnd see your true love march away\n\nWho is it that has come so early?\nWho is it that has come so soon?\nCatie dear, it your true lover\nThat came so early and so soon\n\nCatie dear go ask your parents\nIf you may be the[/my] bride of mine\nIf they say no return and tell me\nAnd no longer will I pine\n\nWilly dear, its no use [to] ask them\nTheir in their room a takin' a rest\nAnd in their hands they both hold daggers\nTo kill the one that I love best\n\nI then take out my silver dagger\nAnd pierce it in my tender breast\nSaying goodbye katay goodbye darling\nI'll die for the one that I love best\n\nI'll then take up his bloody dagger\nAnd pierce it in my lily white breast\nSaying goodbye Catie goodbye darling\nI'll die for the one that I love best\n\nOh may this day be long remembered\nOh, may this day be nere forgot\nTo all you cruel ill hearted parents\nWho try to keep true lovers apart\n\nThe song has also been widely performed and recorded by bluegrass musicians, as many songs thought of as traditionally bluegrass songs actually trace back to what is now known as \"old-time\" music.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 148,584 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 138,957 in 2009 and 144,365 in 2010.\n\nIdaho Falls Regional Airport covers 866 acres (350 ha) at an elevation of 4,744 feet (1,446 m). It has two asphalt runways: 3/21 is 9,002 by 150 feet (2,744 x 46 m) and 17/35 is 4,051 by 75 feet (1,235 x 23 m).\n\nIn 2010 the airport had 38,447 aircraft operations, average 105 per day:\n74% general aviation, 19% air taxi, 6% airline and 1% military. 169 aircraft were then based at this airport: 73% single-engine, 18% multi-engine, 4% jet, 3% helicopter, and 2% glider.\n\nThe airport terminal has been expanded twice and partially re-built once. The current terminal was built in 1959, expanded in 1982 and the boarding area torn down and retrofitted with jetways for smaller aircraft in the mid-2000s. The previous terminal was designed with jetways for 737s, which stopped arriving in Idaho Falls after Delta pulled out in 1998. The latest terminal expansion was completed in 2014. It allows TSA screening of baggage to occur out of view of passengers and allows airlines to again check baggage from ticket counters.\n\nAs of December 1, 2018 Tailwind, a new food, beverage and sundries provider was selected through an open RFP initiated earlier that year. The company is assuming operations in limited mode as proposed renovations take place. The airport expressed a desire to have a vendor that would commit to minimum annual revenue (including a percentage of profits that goes to the airport), specific hours of operation based on flight schedules and out-of-pocket renovations to concession areas.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2018 the airport restaurant and lounge operator used her own name, Kathryn's. The lounge was operated by this local owner starting in 1999. The restaurant operated limited hours and served basic American fare for breakfasts and lunches Monday through Saturday. At other times, souvenirs, sundries and basic food were available at Kathryn's Snack Shack pre-security screening. In later years of operation, after an airport renovation, Kathryn's Snack Shack also operated post-security on the second level of the airport with coffee, beverages and basic sundries.\n\nThe airport has struggled to maintain a viable restaurant operator in the past. The restaurant was known as \"Dolores' Place\" operated by local restaurant critic Dolores Casella, \"Das Kinder Haus\" which served German food, and \"Runway 21\" (1991-1995) which tried to be an upscale steak house and coffee shop. The restaurant has been remodeled once in 1991 and a small fire broke out in 2008 while the restaurant was closed.\n\nScheduled passenger flights as of December 2017:\n\nFor the year 2019, 175,028 Non-Stop Segment Passengers flew in and out of Idaho Falls Airport.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2164115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164115", "title": "Chavurah", "text": "Chavurah\n\nA chavurah or havurah (חבורה Hebrew: \"fellowship\", plural \"chavurot\") is a small group of like-minded Jews who assemble for the purposes of facilitating Shabbat and holiday prayer services, sharing communal experiences such as lifecycle events, or Jewish learning. \"Chavurot\" usually provide autonomous alternatives to established Jewish institutions and Jewish denominations. Most chavurot place an emphasis on egalitarianism in the broad sense (of which gender egalitarianism is one piece), depending on participation by the entire community rather than top-down direction by clergy.\n\nThe first havurah in America was formed in September 1960 in Whittier, California. However, most chavurot in America had their origins in the North American Jewish counter-cultural trends of the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, groups of young rabbis, academics, and political activists founded experimental chavurot for prayer and study, in reaction to what they perceived as an over-institutionalized and unspiritual North American Jewish establishment. Initially the main inspiration was the pietistic fellowships of the Pharisees and other ancient Jewish sects.\n\nInitially some of these groups, like the Boston-area Havurat Shalom, attempted to function as full-fledged rural communes after the model of their secular counterparts. Others formed as communities within the urban or suburban Jewish establishment. Although the leadership and ritual privileges were initially men-only, as in Orthodox Jewish practice, the \"second wave\" of American feminism soon led to the full integration of women in these communities.\n\nApart from some tentative articles in \"Response\" and other Jewish student magazines, the early chavurot attracted little attention in the wider North American Jewish community. Then, in 1973, Michael and Sharon Strassfeld released \"The Jewish Catalog: A Do-It-Yourself Kit.\" Patterned after the recently published counter-culture Whole Earth Catalog, the book served both as a basic reference on Judaism and American Jewish life, as well as a playful compendium of Jewish crafts, recipes, meditational practices, and political action ideas, all aimed at disaffected young Jewish adults. \"The Jewish Catalog\" became one of the best-selling books in American Jewish history to that date and spawned two sequels. A much more widespread chavurah movement soon emerged, including self-governing chavurot within Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist synagogues.\n\nPresent-day chavurot include some chavurot that have functioned continuously since the 1970s, such as Fabrangen and Havurat Shalom, as well as a resurgent wave in independent Jewish communities that have been established post-2000. Both generations of chavurot gather annually at the National Havurah Committee's Summer Institute and at its regional retreats.\n\nThe concept of a Chavurah has ancient roots. The Talmud (Tractate \"Pesachim\") uses the term \"chavurah\" to identify the group of people registered for a single Passover sacrifice, and who held a Seder together, in the days of the Temple in Jerusalem. The Passover Seder is perhaps the prototypical group ritual (traditionally) held outside a synagogue involving the sharing of communal experiences, Jewish learning, and prayer.\n\n"}

It is situated to the north-west of the city centre, in the city council's Park and St Peter's wards.\n\nThe name 'Whitmore' is said by toponymists to come from the Old English 'hwit' (white) and 'mor' (moor - which was used to describe a marshy area) - possibly a foggy area of marsh land, and 'Reans' is said to possibly mean a type of furrow created during ploughing, designed to drain the land. Another name used for the nearby area that West Park now stands on was the 'Hungry Leas' - \"hungry\" being used to describe land which was little or no use for agriculture.\n\nThe 1842 Tithe map shows only Whitmore End House in the area. This was soon to change - Wolverhampton's population was rising rapidly in the mid-1800s - and so a 'new town' would be built to the north west of Wolverhampton. It was originally to be called 'New Hampton', as is known today from the street names Newhampton Roads east and west, but Whitmore Reans was commonly used and stuck.\n\nThe terraced housing that makes up the Whitmore Reans residential area was built alongside roads, cartways and tracks that radiated out from the town centre servicing fields that spread out towards Dunstall and Tettenhall. Newhampton Road (known then as Whitmore End Lane), Molineux Alley & what is now Staveley Road / Dunstall Road, as well as Waterloo Road (then called Wellington Road) were the routes through the fields that houses would be built alongside & between.\n\nFocal points in the Whitmore Reans area were Leicester Square, with its shops and circular iron gentleman's urinal, known under various names such as the 'Pepper Pot' and the 'Green Man', and the area of shops on Newhampton Road West, known to locals as 'West Market'.\n\nIn 1924, the Courtaulds Company started constructing a factory on the former site of Dunstall Hall. Operating from 1926 onwards, the factory produced rayon yarn. Known to many generations and a visible landmark in Whitmore Reans and beyond for almost fifty years were the Courtaulds chimneys, known as the 'three sisters'. They were demolished in June 1973. The Farndale housing estate now stands on the former Courtaulds grounds.\n\nThe areas population displays its recent history of immigration in the diversity of its residents. There are English, Afro-Caribbean, Asian, Polish, Kurdish, African, Irish and many other ethnicities residing in Whitmore Reans. It also has a small number of student residents who reside at the nearby university campus on Waterloo Road, and in private lets dotted throughout the area. Historically, Whitmore Reans was considered to be quite a genteel part of Wolverhampton, being located next to the picturesque West Park. In the latter part of the 20th century, however, the area declined sharply, and while the last 20 years has seen some of the older housing stock brought up to date it is still home to some of the lowest social grades in the City.\n\nSince 1889, Whitmore Reans has been dominated by the Wolverhampton Wanderers football ground, Molineux Stadium, which stands on the eastern side of Waterloo Road. However, all signs of the original stadium disappeared during the first half of the 20th century and the oldest part of the current stadium was built in 1978.\n\nIn 2000, as part of the regeneration, The Newhampton Arts Centre, a community arts centre was developed with lottery funding on the site of the old municipal grammar school and provides a venue for a culturally diverse range of arts activities. Although originally a community project, Newhampton Arts Centre has hosted a variety of events including Wolverhampton's first Strummerjam which was headlined by Wolverhampton born artists Kupid the King and Nathan Neone and Johannesburg born artist T33K1D. It has also been the preferred venue for artists and bands such as Akala and The City Hippies.\n\nWhitmore Reans has a shopping arcade which replaced some of the terraced housing called 'The Avion Centre', which has several shops, a Post Office, Three Cooks bakery, Nvision (Opticians), take-aways and a branch of the Lloyds TSB bank. There is also a library, located just outside the Avion Centre.\n\nNew Hampton Road East and New Hampton Road West (which form the boundary between the Park and St Peter's wards) are secondary roads, but form the main route through Whitmore Reans. At the junction of the New Hampton Roads with Hunter and Clifford streets are several more shops, including the \"Sugar & Spice\" Asian catering store, the \"WV6 Internet Cafe\", \"Burns + Dudgon Ltd\" electricians, \"The Fish Inn\" fish and chip shop, \"Mittu Jewellers\", \"Jhoots Pharmacy\", \"K. Ram & Sons\" convenience store, \"P.H. Services\" (appliance repairs etc.) and a branch of the charity Samaritans. On the corner of Hunter Street and St. Andrews Close is the \"Pak Continental\" convenience store.\n\nIn 2005, Wolverhampton City Council investigated the Farndale estate, built on land formerly occupied by the Courtaulds factory. It was discovered that soil in the gardens of a small number of properties were contaminated with high levels of carbon disulphide, a chemical used in the manufacture of rayon. As a result of the investigation, and work alongside Akzo Nobel (the company who bought out Courtaulds in 1998), four vacant terraced properties in Welbury Gardens were demolished.\n\nWhitmore Reans is often in the press today for adverse reasons - gang warfare, violence and murder appear heavily reported in the local press.\n\nThe policing team who cover Whitmore Reans regularly tweet about policing in the area on the social networking site Twitter (@StaveleyPolice).\n\nWhitmore Reans has a good selection of public houses, some tucked away amongst the Victorian terraced streets. On Fawdry Street is \"The Stile Inn\", a traditional Victorian corner pub, with a bowls green at the back. On Jackson Street / Craddock Street is a moderner pub, \"The Pegasus\". On Newhampton Road East, near to the Avion Centre, is \"The Bagot Arms\". On the corner of Sweetman Street and Riches Street is \"The Newhampton\" - another Victoran corner pub favoured by CAMRA members, with great ale selection and a bowls green (closed permanently early October 2018). Just up the road on Newhampton Road West is \"The Summer House\", and on Waterloo Road near the Molineux is \"The Goal Post\"(renamed The Leaping Wolf in 2018). Also, though not strictly a pub, the \"Whitmore Reans Working Mens Club\" on Bitterne Drive.\n\nSadly, from 2000 onwards, there have been a few pub closures. \"The Tipster\" (the corner of Dunstall Road & Lowe Street - demolished, replaced with flats), \"The Victoria\" (Gatis Street - in a state of ruin & boarded up), \"The Red Lion\" (demolished - now new housing on Great Hampton Street) and the pub next door on Great Hampton Street, \"The Ash Tree\", once a favourite with Wolverhampton Wanderers fans, is no longer a pub. \"The Golden Eagle\" (corner of Hordern Road & Court Road - closed, illegally operating as a Mosque in 2010).\n\nhttp://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/articles/MolineuxAlley/MolineuxAlley01.htm\n"}

W. Crofts, B.D., Vicar of North Grimston, near Malton, Yorkshire. One of his maternal uncles was the Rev. William Carr, B.D. of Bolton Abbey, Yorkshire. His mother was Ellen Wordsworth, the daughter of a Leeds industrialist. Ernest studied at Rugby School, for several years, and then headed to Berlin where he developed his interest in art and decided upon a career as a painter. His first acquaintance with war was made in 1864 when he accompanied a Prussian doctor in the Schleswig-Holstein War, and the operations around Düppel. His sister Ellen Wordsworth Crofts married Sir Francis Darwin and was the mother of poet Frances Cornford.\n\nHe returned to London and became a pupil under A. B. Clay, but was back in Germany a few years later, this time studying at the Düsseldorf school of painting in Europe, where he studied under the German military artist, Emil Hünten, himself an ex-pupil of Horace Vernet, and at the time military and historical painter to the Prussian emperor. Under Hünten, Crofts' talent as a military painter grew, and in 1874, he exhibited \"Retreat\", representing an episode in the Franco-Prussian War during the Battle of Gravelotte, and in the same year, another scene from the same conflict, \"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin\" which won him the Crystal Palace prize medal. Both scenes were influenced by the artist's experience of witnessing some of the closing stages of the war, especially the battles of Weissenbourg, Wörth, and the siege of Strasbourg. While contributing regularly to the annual Royal Academy exhibition, he continued to live in Düsseldorf where he met his future wife.\nIn 1875, Crofts exhibited \"Ligny\" at the Royal Academy of Arts (RA) and at the International Exhibition in Philadelphia. The following year saw his picture representing \"The morning of the Battle of Waterloo\" which captured the dawn of the day with the tired and bespattered troops. One critic described it as follows: \"Mr. Crofts' large canvas is admirable in the grouping of the soldiers on the morning of the battle; the day is breaking, on a weary, wounded and mud-stained company, some lying on the bare ground with knapsacks for pillows, some up and preparing for the march. The artillery are just on the move, and the note of preparation is sounding. The tone of the picture reminds us of the French school\". The artist's first notable pictures of the English Civil War were exhibited in 1877, one of which depicted \"Oliver Cromwell at Marston Moor\". In the same year, he refused the offer of an appointment of military painter to the Prince of Roumania to be attached to his staff during the Russo-Turkish War.\n\nCrofts was elected an Associate of the RA on 19 July 1878, the year that his picture, \"Wellington on his march from Quatre Bras to Waterloo\" was shown. In the same year, his painting entitled \"The Morning of the Battle of Waterloo\" was shown at the Paris International Exhibition; this depicted the French army retiring from the battlefield, with Napoleon leaving his carriage and preparing to mount his horse. The artist walked and sketched much of the area around the battlefield of Waterloo including La Haye Sainte, Hougoumont and La Belle Alliance. In 1896, he was elected a full academician of the Royal Academy, and his Diploma Work, a Civil War scene, was entitled \"To the Rescue\". Two years later he succeeded Philip Calderon as keeper and trustee of the RA, which gave him accommodation at Burlington House. He was in effect chief director of the academy art schools as well as chief custodian of the Diploma Galley, which required \"firmness, kindness and tact,\" according to one obituary, and Crofts was noted for his \"pleasant manner, his good looks, and his amiability of character\" which made him an ideal keeper.\n\nBesides historical scenes, Crofts did paint some contemporary military events. In 1901, for instance, the king commissioned him to paint a picture of the distribution of the war medals following the Boer War. Two years later, he painted a large scene of the funeral of Queen Victoria. One of his most ambitious works was the panel in the ambulatory of the Royal Exchange which portrayed Elizabeth I opening the first Royal Exchange in 1571. His trilogy of paintings chronicling the final moments, death and burial of Charles I were popular, but there was some disagreement over the representation of the block upon which the king knelt to be beheaded. Some argued about the accuracy, contending that the block of the period was a lower one, being just a few inches from the ground, and that to reach it, the king would have had to lie flat.\n\nCrofts lived at 'The Green' which he helped to re-design, next to Blythburgh church in Suffolk. He had married a German lady, Elizabeth Wüsthofen of Düsseldorf, and they had one daughter. The artist died of pneumonia at Burlington House on 19 March 1911. His funeral service was held at St. James's Church, Piccadilly, on Thursday 23 March, followed by his burial at Kensal Green Cemetery. A sale of his remaining works was held at Christie, Manson & Woods on Monday 18 December 1911.\n\nWhile Crofts's pictures were popular in the 1870s and 1880s, the public lost its appetite for war paintings in the early years of the 20th century following the setbacks in South Africa. His obituary noted that \"his taste was a little theatrical, and his talent not good enough to redeem it...it is safe to say that he will be best remembered, not by them, but by his good work at the Academy Schools and by his administrative services to the body of which he was a useful member...the exacting taste of the present day asks for something less conventional than his rather superficial battle scenes\". While the artist's pictures continue to be used as illustration in history and military books, today he is rarely mentioned as a significant historical artist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The airport is also the home to the National Weather Service Pocatello Office.\n\nAs per the Federal Aviation Administration, this airport had 25,756 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 21,039 in 2009, and 20,825 in 2010. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a \"primary commercial service\" airport.\n\nThe airport is home to the Kizuna Garden, built to commemorate the bond between Pocatello and its sister city Iwamizawa.\n\nPocatello Regional Airport covers an area of 3,374 acres (1,365 ha) at an elevation of 4,452 feet (1,357 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways with asphalt surfaces: 3/21 is 9,060 by 150 feet (2,761 x 46 m) and 17/35 is 7,150 by 100 feet (2,179 x 30 m).\n\nFor the 12-month period ending January 1, 2012, the airport had 36,764 aircraft operations, an average of 100 per day: 79% general aviation, 20% air taxi, 1% military, and <1% scheduled commercial. At that time there were 73 aircraft based at this airport: 70% single-engine, 22% multi-engine, 7% helicopter, and 1% jet.\n\nIn 1943, the Pocatello Army Airfield was built as a Second Air Force heavy bomber (B-17, B-24) training base.\n\nIn 1949, it became surplus property and was obtained by the city of Pocatello to build a commercial airport.\n\nWestern Air Lines served Pocatello for a number of years, but discontinued all service by 1980. According to the airline's August 1, 1968 system timetable, Western operated Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprops into Pocatello. This Electra service was then replaced with Boeing 737-200 jetliner service with nonstop flights to Salt Lake City, and direct flights to Las Vegas and Los Angeles, according to the airline's September 6, 1973 system timetable. After discontinuing mainline flights, the airline subsequently served the airport as Western Express which was operated as code share service by SkyWest with commuter turboprop aircraft.\n\nIn the mid 1970s, Hughes Airwest served the airport with Douglas DC-9-10 and DC-9-30 jetliners, according to the February 1, 1976 edition of the North American Official Airline Guide.\n\nIn the mid 1980s, Cascade Airways served Pocatello with British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven twin jets, according to the February 15, 1985 edition of the North American Official Airline Guide (OAG). The OAG also lists Cascade flights operated with smaller Fairchild Metro commuter turboprops.\n\nHorizon Air served Pocatello until January 7, 2006, originally with service to Salt Lake City in 1983. The airline canceled that service in favor of flights to Boise starting in 1984 operated with de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 turboprops.\n\nBig Sky Airlines served Pocatello from the day Horizon canceled service until March 30, 2007.\n\nIn 2014, a World War II-era mortar was found on the airport grounds while doing routine maintenance work. The mortar was safely removed by law enforcement.\n\n\n"}

The lyrics include a dialogue between the lovers.\n\nThe first published version of the song appeared in \"Roxburghe Ballads\" dated 1710; the lyrics were there given the title \"The True Lover's Farewell\". \n\n\"Fare Thee Well\" shares several lyrics which parallel those of Robert Burns' \"A Red, Red Rose\". The lyrics are also strikingly similar to a folk song titled, \"My Dear Mary Ann\" that dates back to the mid-19th century. Similarities include the meter and rhyme scheme, as well as the alternative title of \"Ten Thousand Miles\". Lyrical similarities include the opening line, \"Fare thee well my own true love\", \"Ten thousand miles or more\" (word-for-word matches), and the question of seeing a dove or other bird crying for its love. The subjects of the songs are practically identical: Lovers mourning their separation and longing to return to one another.\n\nIn 1919, the composer and folk-song scholar Ralph Vaughan Williams wrote an arrangement of the song, entitled \"The Turtle Dove\", for solo baritone (later re-arranged for solo and SATB choir).\n\nThe song has been recorded, notably by Nic Jones as \"Ten Thousand Miles\", as well as by Joan Baez on her 1960 debut album, Mary Black, Eliza Carthy, Chad & Jeremy, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Liam Clancy, Marianne Faithfull and as \"Ten Thousand Miles\" by Burl Ives, Molina and Roberts, and June Tabor.\n\nA version of the song by Mary Chapin Carpenter, entitled \"10,000 Miles\", was used in the movie \"Fly Away Home\" (1996).\nThe King's Singers performed and recorded an arrangement of The Turtle Dove by their baritone Philip Lawson (composer and arranger)\n\n<poem>\nFare thee well my own true love\nAnd farewell for a while.\nI’m going away, but I’ll come again\nIf I go ten thousand miles.\n\nTen thousand miles, my own true love,\nTen thousand miles or more,\nAnd the rocks may melt and the seas may burn,\nIf I should not return.\n\nOh don’t you see that lonesome dove,\nSitting on an ivy tree,\nShe’s weeping for her own true love\nJust as I shall weep for mine.\n\nOh come back my own true love\nAnd stay a while with me\nFor if I had a friend all on this earth,\nYou’ve been a friend to me.\n\nAnd fare thee well my own true love\nAnd farewell for a while.\nI’m going away, but I’ll be back\nIf I go ten thousand miles.\n</poem>\n\nReferences 1-6 are transcribed from the Traditional Ballad Index website listed in \"External Links\" below\n"}

The body of the butterfly is black with orange brown on the upperside of the wings. Also on the underside are black veins with black spots. The undersides of the wings have silver metallic spots. The wings and the body are both covered in fine hairs.\n\nThe native range spread from Washington state to California. They are now found in Oregon and California. , they were found in numbers in Alpine County, California, at the 9,000 foot (2,700 m) level in the Sierra Nevada range. The best habitats for the butterflies are coastal salt spray meadows, montane meadows, and stabilized dunes. The grasslands provide larval host plants which are a very important component of their habitat.\n\nAbout 15 subspecies are accepted.\n\n\nIn 1999, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service initiated a recovery plan for \"Speyeria zerene\". The recovery program helped establish breeding programs in several zoos and colleges that provide captive rearing for \"Speyeria zerene\". In late summer, female butterflies are captured after they have mated and then transferred to a facility where they are induced to lay eggs. After the eggs hatch, the larvae are stored in a refrigerator over winter in order to replicate the conditions of the season. After the winter dormancy, the larvae are fed and cared for until they pupate or are large enough to be returned to the wild. \n\nOther programs that are being implemented to help the wild population include the regular mowing of meadows by private home owners, and especially habitat restoration for properties owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. One of the most essential components of the \"Speyeria zerene\" habitat is the blue violet, or \"Viola adunca\"; it is used for the food and shelter of the early stages of a larva's life. However, the blue violet is also threatened by invasive species and the overgrowth of shrubs and trees in meadows. The facilities that have established breeding programs for the butterflies have also set up nurseries for the blue violets. These nurseries are mainly used to provide food for the larvae reared in these facilities, but some violets are also transported and planted in restoration sites.\n\nThe life cycle of \"Speyeria zerene\" begin when the pink-tan colored eggs hatch. Females lay these eggs on the dried stems and debris of the blue violet (\"Viola adunca\"). The larvae, which have spikes on their backs and are dark in color, emerge in the spring. The larvae grow in six stages of development (instars) and feed on the violet until it is time for the larvae to pupate, which they do on the violet. The pupae will remain there for approximately two weeks, until it emerges as a butterfly. The butterfly has a life expectancy of about three weeks. During this time the butterflies mate and feed solely on nectar. Females then lay eggs, and the life cycle starts again.\n\nThe diet of \"Speyeria zerene\" varies throughout its life history. When the larva emerges in the spring the diet consists solely on the leaves of the blue violet (\"Viola adunca\"). When the adult emerges from its chrysalis it will feed solely on nectar of flowers. It feeds on a variety of plants including ones from the family Asteraceae, its main source of nutrition, but other families of plants that the butterfly may feed on include thistles, asters, yarrow, and pearly everlasting.\n\n"}

{"id": "2164190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164190", "title": "Cellomics", "text": "Cellomics\n\nCellomics is the discipline of quantitative cell analysis using bioimaging methods and informatics with a workflow involving three major components: image acquisition, image analysis, and data visualization and management. These processes are generally automated. All three of these components depend on sophisticated software to acquire qualitative data, quantitative data, and the management of both images and data, respectively. Cellomics is also a trademarked term, which is often used interchangeably with high-content analysis (HCA) or high-content screening (HCS), but cellomics extends beyond HCA/HCS by incorporating sophisticated informatics tools.\n\nHCS and the discipline of cellomics was pioneered by a once privately held company named Cellomics Inc., which commercialized instruments, software, and reagents to facilitate the study of cells in culture, and more specifically, their responses to potentially therapeutic drug-like molecules. In 2005, Cellomics was acquired by Fisher Scientific International, Inc., now Thermo Fisher Scientific, which continues developing cellomics-centered products under its Thermo Scientific™ high content analysis product line.\n\nLike many of the -omics, e.g., genomics and proteomics, applications have grown in depth and breadth over time. Currently there are over 40 different application areas that cellomics is used in, including the analysis of 3-D cell models, angiogenesis, and cell-signalling. Originally a tool used by the pharmaceutical industry for screening, cellomics has now expanded into academia to better understand cell function in the context of the cell. Cellomics is used in both academic and industrial life-science research in areas, such as cancer research, neuroscience research, drug discovery, consumer products safety, and toxicology; however, there are many more areas for which cellomics could provide a much deeper understanding of cellular function.\n\nWith HCA at its core, cellomics incorporates the flexibility of fluorescence microscopy, the automation and capacity of the plate reader, and flow cytometry’s multi-parametric analysis in order to extract data from single-cells or from a population of cells.\n\nOnce an image is acquired using high content technology hardware, cell data is extracted from that image using image analysis software. Single cell data or population data may be of interest, but for both, a series of steps is followed with varying degrees of user interaction depending on the application and the software being used. The first step is segmenting the cells in the image which provides the software algorithms with the information it needs for downstream processing of individual cell measurements. Next, a user must define the area(s) of interest based on a multitude of parameters, i.e., the area a user wants to measure. After the area of interest has been defined, measurements are collected. The measurements, oftentimes referred to as features, are dictated by the type of data desired from the sample. There are many mathematical algorithms powering all of these steps, and each image analysis software package provides its own level of openness to the mathematical algorithms being used.\n\nLarge numbers of images and amounts of data need to be managed when doing cellomics research. Data and image volumes can quickly range from 11MB to 1TB in less than a year, which is why cellomics uses the power of informatics to collect, organize, and archive all of this information. Secure and effective data mining requires the associated metadata to be captured and integrated into the data management model. Due to the critical nature of cellomics data management, implementing cellomics studies often requires inter-departmental cooperation between information technology and the life science research group leading the study.\n"}

It is composed of three villages: Lunca Câlnicului (\"Farkasvágó\"), Prejmer and Stupinii Prejmerului (\"Rohrau\"; \"Méheskert\"). Located 18 km northeast of Brașov, the Olt River passes through the commune.\n\nAt the 2011 census, 90.7% of inhabitants were Romanians, 6.3% Roma, 1.9% Hungarians and 0.8% Germans.\n\nThe Teutonic Knights constructed the fortress Tartlau in 1212–1213 as part of their colonization of the Burzenland region. The town of Prejmer near the castle had begun development by 1225, and was the eastern-most settlement of the Transylvanian Saxons. Prejmer was repeatedly invaded throughout the Middle Ages by various groups, including the Mongols, Tatars, Hungarians, Ottoman Turks, Cossacks, and Moldavians. However, the castle was only captured once, by Gabriel Báthory in 1611. Most of Prejmer's German population fled the commune after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. \n\nPrejmer is noted for its fortified church, one of the best preserved of its kind in Eastern Europe. Between 1962–1970, the Romanian government carefully restored it to its present condition; the restoration work was done under the direction of architect Mariana Angelescu and engineer Alexandru Dobriceanu. The church is modeled after churches of Jerusalem, as well as built in the style of Late Gothic churches from the Rhineland. In the 15th century, it was surrounded by a wall 12m high, forming a quadrilateral with rounded corners. The wall was reinforced by four horseshoe-shaped towers, two of which have since disappeared. The entrance—a vaulted gallery—is protected by a barbican and flanked by a lateral wall. The defensive structure is strengthened by embrasures and bretèches, while the covered way is surrounded by a parapet. The granaries and rooms that accommodated the villagers are arranged on four levels above the cellars.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Versatile and portable because of its pasteurization process, Laughing Cow can remain unrefrigerated for a limited length of time. The archetypal Laughing Cow cheese comes wrapped in the individual serving-sized foiled wedges, and they are packaged in a round, flat box. Consumers have to pull a little red thread around the box to open it, and the foil packaging also features a red tab for opening. The company was founded in 1921. The Laughing Cow is available in these formats in different worldwide markets:\n\nDiscontinued formats of The Laughing Cow include: \n\nThe Laughing Cow USA introduced a TV commercial in 2009 where the company introduced a new slogan, \"Have you laughed today?\" In 2010 they updated the brand's website to include cheese recipes.\nLaughing Cow cheese is available in its original flavour, a light version with 7% fat, and an ultra-light version with 3% fat. In addition, flavoured versions of the cheese (such as ham, gruyère, garlic, paprika, mushroom, chèvre, bleu, hazelnut, pizza and onion) are also available in various markets worldwide.\n\nThe Laughing Cow is red and white and jovial, and is almost always depicted wearing ear tags that look like the round boxes the cheese comes in (an example of the Droste effect). On April 16, 1921, Léon Bel trademarked his brand, called \"La Vache qui rit\", in France. In the trademark, the cow is said to have 'a hilarious expression'. Bel had made the original drawing himself, after seeing a travelling meat wagon during World War I called \"La Wachkyrie\", a play on the word for \"Valkyrie\". In the beginning she was not laughing, she was not red and she did not wear ear tags. This patent was the very first branded cheese product registered in France. In 1924, illustrator Benjamin Rabier edited the drawing into something more like the image that prevails today. The blue and white stripes around the box date from 1955. Since 1976 both ear-tag boxes have been shown with the top-side visible. Before that year consumers were shown a top and bottom side. The current logo uses the Droste effect, with the laughing cow appearing inside the ear tags.\n\nIt has long been popular in the United Kingdom and Canada as a children's snack. The cheese has also been a constant, but hardly popular, product in the United States for a number of years. However, demand for the triangular wedges has increased significantly recently, since the light version of the product was suggested as a viable menu item to followers of the South Beach Diet. The question asked by the French, \"\"Pourquoi La Vache Qui Rit rit?\"\" (\"Why is The Laughing Cow laughing?\") has become synonymous with the product.\n\nGroupe Bel announced on October 2, 2005, that they plan to open a 13 million Euro factory in Syria. This was the first such direct investment in that nation by a French food company.\n\nThe product is localized by name nearly everywhere it is sold: \n\nIn the countries of the former Yugoslavia, a very similar type of cheese produced in Croatia and called \"Zdenka\" is very popular and has become a generic trademark.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2164202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164202", "title": "Operations Malheur I and Malheur II", "text": "Operations Malheur I and Malheur II\n\nOperation Malheur I and Operation Malheur II were a series of search and destroy operations conducted by the 1st Brigade 101st Airborne Division operating as part of Task Force Oregon in Quảng Ngãi Province.\n\nOn 29 April, COMUSMACV General William Westmoreland ordered the 1st Brigade commanded by Brigadier general Salve H. Matheson to immediately join Task Force Oregon in I Corps. In early May the brigade put ashore at Razorback Beach in southern Quảng Ngai, established a base named Carentan, and prepared for action against the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN)/Viet Cong (VC)'s inland base areas-numbered 122, 123 and 124 which ran from north to south through the mountainous jungle overlooking the Ve and Tra Cau River Valleys. On 11 May, the 1st Brigade moved into the interior looking for the 1st and 2nd Regiments, both of which were thought to lurk there. Two of the three battalions conducted air assaults into the western part of Base Area 124, a tangle of tree-clad low hills overlooking the coastal plain. Resistance was light. The next morning Matheson committed his remaining battalion to a blocking position on high ground in the eastern part of the base area and ordered the other two battalions to sweep toward it. Encountering little opposition in the days that followed, Matheson decentralized his operations and conducted a more rigorous search. Matheson allowed each battalion commander to work his operational area as he saw fit, insisting only that companies operate within a two-hour march of each other. Most units kept constantly on the move and traveled with three to five days' worth of supplies, so the PAVN/VC would be less likely to pinpoint their location by observing resupply helicopters. Companies split into platoons for wider coverage of a search area, but remained close enough to reassemble quickly if they ran into a sizable force. These tactics often paid off. On 13 May, near the Tra Cau's headwaters, 12 separate firefights occurred, the largest against an entrenched VC company. By nightfall, the Americans had killed 29 VC at a cost of 1 American killed and 7 wounded, but the outcome was not always so one-sided. On 18 May Company B, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, moved well inside a large VC camp before realizing that the occupants had not yet fled. Confusion reigned during the firefight, and the Americans realized they were too close to their enemy to call in artillery or helicopter gunships. For six hours they fought, sometimes hand to hand, until reinforcements arrived and the VC pulled back. Left on the battlefield were 31 VC dead, while American casualties were 12 killed and 41 wounded. Matheson's men completed their scouring of Base Area 124 in early June, reporting that they had killed or captured over 400 VC, seized 125 weapons, and razed several base camps.\n\nTask Force Oregon commander General William B. Rosson then ordered Matheson to shift his attention slightly north, to Base Areas 123 and 122. Both were more mountainous than 124 and were often drenched by cloudbursts leftover from storms brewing around the inland peaks near the Laotian border. If Matheson failed to find VC there, he was to assist the Quảng Ngãi province chief with the evacuation of all civilians from the Ve and Tra Cau Valleys. Whatever their political loyalties, these civilians had provided food and recruits for the VC. Matheson sent two battalions into Base Area 123 on 8 June and another into 122 the following day. While the first day's fighting ended with 22 VC killed, it was apparent to the Americans that the VC were trying to avoid contact. With few enemy units to be found, Matheson turned to evacuating civilians. For two weeks trucks and helicopters moved over 7,000 people and 1,200 head of cattle to refugee centers in Đức Phổ and Nghĩa Hành Districts. When the operation ended in late June, the valleys had been laid waste by combat and herbicides, while several hundred tons of rice and salt were either destroyed or airlifted to refugee centers. In July, believing that the VC were re-forming in Base Area 124, the airborne brigade returned south. A week of searching, however, uncovered only small enemy units. Documents and prisoners revealed that both the 1st and 2nd Regiments had lost several commanders and that illness, desertions and heavy casualties had greatly diminished their effectiveness. When Matheson received a report in mid-July that the two units were converging on Base Area 123 to form a single combat-effective regiment, he called in B-52s. On the heels of the bombing, all three of his battalions air-assaulted back into the region, which they again swept clean through the rest of the month. Yet, once again, the VC evaded, though American sweeps killed over 100 VC, including a VC district chief and his aides.\n\nWhen the operations closed, the 1st Brigade reported 869 VC and PAVN killed and 314 weapons captured, for the loss of 81 US killed. The United States Agency for International Development reported 6,400 civilian casualties in the province for 1967 throughout the year, though obviously not all of these could be attributed to the Malheur operations or even to American military action.\n"}

The airport is operated by the Friedman Memorial Airport Authority under a Joint Powers Agreement between the city of Hailey and Blaine County. It serves the resort communities of Sun Valley and Ketchum, and the surrounding areas in the Wood River Valley. \n\nFriedman Memorial Airport, the gateway to Sun Valley, is built on land donated by the Friedman children and named in memory of their father. S.J. Friedman arrived in Idaho in 1869 to raise cattle and sheep and was elected Hailey's first mayor.\n\nFriedman Memorial Airport covers an area of 211 acres (0.85 km) at an elevation of above sea level. It has one asphalt paved runway designated 13/31 which measures .\n\nFor the 12-month period ending May 31, 2007, the airport had 68,540 aircraft operations, an average of 187 per day: 58% general aviation, 38% air taxi, 3% scheduled commercial and <1% military. At that time there were 150 aircraft based at this airport: 67% single-engine, 25% multi-engine, 5% jet, 1% helicopter and 1% ultralight.\n\nThe Friedman family donated much of the land for the airport to the city of Hailey in 1931 and the airport was officially recognized in 1932. According to historic photographs, the site had been used for aviation as early as 1916. Scheduled commercial passenger service began at the airport in August 1960 with the arrival of West Coast Airlines, a forerunner of both Air West and Hughes Airwest. According to various West Coast Airlines system timetables during the 1960s, the airline was serving Sun Valley with Douglas DC-3 and Piper Navajo twin prop aircraft. West Coast successor Air West briefly served Friedman with Piper Navajo twin prop commuter aircraft with nonstop flights to Boise and Salt Lake City as well as direct, no change of plane service to Portland, OR following West Coast's merger with Bonanza Air Lines and Pacific Air Lines to form Air West in 1968 while successor Hughes Airwest never served the airport. Instead, Hughes Airwest operated its Douglas DC-9-10 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners into the Magic Valley Regional Airport (TWF) in Twin Falls which it advertised in its various system timetables during the 1970s as being the \"jet gateway\" for Sun Valley.\n\nDelta Air Lines is the dominant carrier at the airport via its Delta Connection service which was operated for many years by SkyWest Airlines with Embraer EMB-120 \"Brasilia\" turboprop aircraft. In January 2014 this Delta Connection service was enhanced and expanded with SkyWest-operated Canadair CRJ-700 regional jet flights. Delta now operates the most flights with year-round nonstop service to its Salt Lake City hub only.\n\nUnited Airlines started seasonal service during the winter ski season in 2013 nonstop from San Francisco which was operated by SkyWest Airlines flying as United Express using CRJ-700 regional jets. Later that year, United Express announced that it would expand its service to add nonstop summer flights from San Francisco. Later, United Express announced their new nonstop CRJ-700 regional jet flights to Denver effective in July 2014.\n\nAlaska Airlines, via its wholly owned regional partner Horizon Air, operate nonstop flights to Seattle with Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft which is the largest and fastest member of the Dash 8 turboprop family. More flights operate during the winter ski season than any other time of year from the airport. Alaska/Horizon usually has 100 days of service to Los Angeles from mid December to late March. Horizon Air began serving Sun Valley late in 1983 with nonstop flights to Seattle and Boise operated with Fairchild F-27 turboprop aircraft.\n\nHistorically, in addition to the aforementioned West Coast Airlines and Air West propellor aircraft service, the airport had scheduled passenger jet flights provided in the past on a seasonal basis during the winter ski season operated by Horizon Air and America West Airlines. Horizon Air flew Fokker F28 Fellowship jets nonstop to San Francisco and Seattle while America West flew Boeing 737-300 jetliners nonstop to Los Angeles, Phoenix and Boise with direct, no change of plane jet service to Las Vegas and San Jose, CA. The Boeing 737 was the largest aircraft ever to serve Sun Valley on a scheduled basis. Following the cessation of these F28 and 737 flights, the airport did not have scheduled passenger jet service for many years until Delta Connection and United Express introduced Canadair CRJ-700 jet flights into Sun Valley in 2013 and 2014 respectively.\n\nIn the 1970s, the airport was served by Sun Valley Airlines (later \"Sun Valley Key Airlines\" which then changed its name to Key Airlines) using de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, Convair 440, Piper Navajo and other propeller-driven aircraft. The airfield was also briefly served over the years by Gem State Airlines, Mountain West Airlines, Golden Gate Airlines and Scenic Airlines. Transwestern Airlines provided service for two years, until sidelined by a non-fatality accident near Hailey in 1983 which involved an emergency landing attempt on Highway 75. It was acquired later that year by Horizon Air, which began service in the early 1980s. Air Idaho served the airport as well during the mid 1970s with de Havilland Heron four engine commuter prop aircraft.\n\n\n"}

There are no higher mountains in New Mexico south of Santa Fe Baldy. It is prominent as seen from Los Alamos and communities along the Rio Grande in northern New Mexico, but is relatively inconspicuous from Santa Fe, as its north-south trending main ridge line is seen nearly end-on, disguising the size of the mountain. Tree line in the Sangre de Cristos is unusually high (exceeding in places) and only the top of the mountain is perpetually free of trees, but several severe forest fires have created bare spots extending to lower elevations. An extensive region of aspen trees on its flanks produces spectacular orange-yellow coloration during the fall that is the subject of many photographic studies.\n\nSanta Fe Baldy rises in the Pecos Wilderness within the Santa Fe National Forest, on the water divide between the Rio Grande and the Pecos River. The western slopes are drained by the Rio Capulin and the Rio Nambe, both flowing to the Rio Grande. The eastern side of the mountain consists of two small cirques, one containing \"Lake Katherine\", one of the highest lakes in New Mexico at elevation . Lake Katherine was given its name by theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer\n\nThe peak is accessed by Trail 251, the Skyline Trail, which climbs to a saddle about below the summit; the remaining distance is covered by a steep unofficial trail along the ridgeline. Under good conditions the summit is a simple \"walk-up\" climb, but the Sangre de Cristos are unusually prone to lightning, and during the summer months, the wise hiker is off Santa Fe Baldy and other high summits in the range by noon, to avoid afternoon thunderstorms.\n\nNearby peaks include \"Lake Peak\", and \"Tesuque Peak\", , both located about to the south of Santa Fe Baldy. Santa Fe Ski Basin is on the western slopes of Tesuque Peak.\n\nOn 11 June 2009, Santa Fe Baldy was the scene of a helicopter accident that claimed the life of New Mexico State Police Sergeant Andrew Tingwall and University of New Mexico graduate student Megumi Yamamoto. The helicopter crashed after Tingwall rescued Yamamoto. Yamamoto had been hiking with her boyfriend, but had become lost.\n\n"}

Along with Franciszek Żwirko, he won the international air contest Challenge 1932 NB Polish Wikipedia site gives his year of birth as 1901.\n\nHe was born in Warsaw. In his youth he was interested in mechanics and aviation, and he was also a Boy Scout. In 1920, during the Polish-Soviet War, he volunteered for the 8th Field Artillery Regiment. In 1921, he started studies at Warsaw University of Technology (Warsaw Tech), where he met Stanislaw Rogalski and Jerzy Drzewiecki. He was one of founders of the Aviation Section of Students' Mechanical Club. In December 1925, students of the Section founded their own workshop, where they built aircraft. In 1926, Wigura and Rogalski designed their first light aircraft WR-1, built in 1927.\n\nIn 1927, three designers: Rogalski, Wigura, and Drzewiecki started working together, creating the RWD team (it was an acronym of their names). Wigura's task was for all the initial design calculations and development. In 1928, they built their first sportsplane RWD-1. In 1929, Wigura graduated from Warsaw Tech, receiving the Engineer title. In the same year, he completed a pilot course in the Academic Aeroclub. The RWD team began constructing more successful aircraft - sportsplane RWD-2 of 1929 (4 built) and the bigger RWD-4 of 1930 (9 built). They were used in Polish sports aviation, with some success.\n\nWigura himself became active in sports aviation. It was thanks to his friendship with 8-years-older pilot Franciszek Żwirko, assigned by the military as a liaison officer in the Aeroclub. They often flew together, Wigura as a mechanic and second pilot. Between August 9 and September 6, 1929, Żwirko and Wigura flew on the RWD-2 prototype across Europe, on a Warsaw-Paris-Barcelona-Milano-Warsaw route of 5,000 kilometers. On October 6 they won a Polish air race. In July 1930, Żwirko and Wigura took part in the International Tourist Plane Competition (Challenge 1930), flying the RWD-4, but they had to withdraw on July 25 due to engine failure after a compulsory landing in Spain. During September and October 1930, they won in two Polish contests, flying on RWD-2 and RWD-4, and in September 1931, they won another one, flying on a prototype RWD-5.\n\nIn a meantime, Wigura with others designed further aircraft: liaison plane RWD-3 in 1930 (one built), record sportsplane RWD-7 in 1931, and a sportsplane RWD-5 in 1931. The latter was made famous as the lightest plane that made a transatlantic flight (20 built). He also started designing the RWD-8 basic trainer. In 1932, he developed a modern sportsplane, the RWD-6, that was intended for the International Tourist Plane Competition (Challenge 1932), which took place between August 20–28, 1932. Żwirko, intended as a pilot, chose Wigura as his crewmate. They won a competition, over the heavily favored German and other teams, and both became heroes in Poland. The success was brought by Żwirko's piloting skills and the high quality and performance of the plane.\n\nOn 11 September 1932, while flying to an air meet in Prague, Żwirko and Wigura fatally crashed in their RWD-6 in the forest in Cierlicko near Cieszyn, when the wing broke in a heavy storm.\n\nStanislaw Wigura was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta and the Polish Gold Cross of Merit.\n"}

The airport is owned by the City and County of Twin Falls. It is mostly used for general aviation but is also served by one commercial airline.\n\nAs per the Federal Aviation Administration, this airport had 29,606 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 26,991 in 2009, and 35,576 in 2010. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a \"primary commercial service\" airport.\n\nThe facility covers an area of 1,468 acres (594 ha) at an elevation of 4,154 feet (1,266 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways with asphalt surfaces: 8/26 is 8,703 by 150 feet (2,653 x 46 m) and 12/30 is 3,224 by 75 feet (983 x 23 m).\n\nFor the 12-month period ending January 1, 2017, the airport had 27,337 aircraft operations, an average of 75 per day: 75% general aviation, 17% air taxi, 4% military, and 4% scheduled commercial. At that time there were 112 aircraft based at this airport: 75% single-engine, 16% multi-engine, 7% helicopter, and 2% jet.\n\nSkyWest Airlines, operating as Delta Connection on behalf of Delta Air Lines via a code sharing agreement, operates Canadair CRJ200 regional jet flights nonstop to Salt Lake City (SLC).\n\nWest Coast Airlines and its successors Air West, Hughes Airwest and Republic Airlines (1979-1986) served the airport for many years. In 1954, West Coast was serving Twin Falls with nonstop Douglas DC-3 flights to Boise and Burley/Rupert with direct service to Pocatello and Idaho Falls as well as connecting flights to Portland, OR and Seattle Boeing Field. By 1960, West Coast was operating Fairchild F-27 turboprops into the airport with nonstop flights to Boise and Salt Lake City and also direct, no change of plane F-27 service to Seattle Boeing Field. In 1968, West Coast merged with Bonanza Air Lines and Pacific Air Lines to form Air West which in turn continued to serve Twin Falls. Air West was operating Fairchild F-27 propjet service into the airport in 1968 with nonstop flights to Boise and Salt Lake City as well as direct, no change of plane flights to Phoenix and Spokane. According to the July 1, 1968 Air West system timetable, Twin Falls was even receiving international service of a sort at this time as the airline was operating a direct F-27 flight from Calgary into the airport via intermediate stops in Spokane, Boise and other small cities in the region. Air West then changed its name to Hughes Airwest which in turn continued to serve Twin Falls.\n\nThe jet age arrived in Twin Falls during the early 1970s. In 1972, Hughes Airwest was operating all flights into the airport with Douglas DC-9-10 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jets with nonstop service to Boise and Salt Lake City as well as direct, no change of plane DC-9 flights to Los Angeles (LAX), Las Vegas, Seattle, Spokane, Burbank and other destinations. The July 1, 1972 Hughes Airwest system timetable stated that Twin Falls was the \"jet gateway\" for the Sun Valley, Idaho summer and ski resort area as the Friedman Memorial Airport (SUN) serving Sun Valley did not have airline jet flights at this time and was only served by commuter air carriers operating turboprop and prop aircraft during the 1970s. By 1975, Hughes Airwest was continuing to operate all flights into Twin Falls with DC-9-10 and DC-9-30 jets with nonstop service to Boise, Salt Lake City, Stockton and Pocatello in addition to direct flights to San Francisco (SFO), Los Angeles (LAX), Orange County, Las Vegas, Seattle, Portland, OR, Spokane and Idaho Falls. During the ski season in early 1976, the airline had added nonstop DC-9 flights between Twin Falls and both Los Angeles (LAX) and San Francisco (SFO) which were operated only on Saturdays. According to the February 1, 1976 Official Airline Guide, Hughes Airwest was the only airline operating jet service into Twin Falls at this time with eight DC-9 jet flights a day operated to the airport on Saturdays with a lesser number of jet flights operated on other days of the week. This same OAG also lists direct, no change of plane DC-9 flights operated from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Seattle, Portland, OR, Santa Ana/Orange County, Santa Barbara, Spokane, Idaho Falls and Lewiston, ID in addition to daily nonstop DC-9 flights from Boise, Salt Lake City, Stockton, CA and Pocatello. In 1980, the airline was still operating DC-9 jet service nonstop to Boise and Salt Lake City with one stop direct flights to Burbank, Phoenix and Portland, OR as well as direct, no change of plane DC-9 flights to Seattle, Spokane and Tucson. \n\nHughes Airwest was then acquired by and merged into Republic Airlines (1979-1986) which continued to serve Twin Falls. In 1982, Republic was operating DC-9 jet service from the airport nonstop to Boise, Salt Lake City and Pocatello with direct, no change of plane flights to Seattle, Spokane and Burbank. By 1984, Western Airlines was serving Twin Falls on a seasonal basis with nonstop flights to Los Angeles (LAX) operated with Boeing 737-200 jetliners. However, by 1985 both Republic and Western had ceased serving Twin Falls and the airport no longer had jet service at this time. Jet service then briefly returned in early 1993 when Morris Air was operating nonstop Boeing 737-300 flights to Salt Lake City.\n\nSeveral commuter air carriers also served Twin Falls over the years. In the early 1970s, Trans Magic Airlines (TMA), which was based in Twin Falls, was operating a hub at the airport with flights to Boise, Burley, ID, Coeur d'Alene, ID, Idaho Falls, Jackpot, NV, Lewiston, ID, McCall, ID, Mountain Home Air Force Base, Moscow, ID, Pocatello, Pullman, WA, Salt Lake City and Sun Valley, ID with this commuter airline flying de Havilland Heron four engine prop aircraft and Piper Navajo twin engine prop aircraft. By 1974, Air Idaho was operating a small hub at the airport with nonstop service to Boise, Burley, Elko, NV, Salt Lake City and Sun Valley flown with de Havilland Heron aircraft. In 1976, another commuter air carrier, Sun Valley Key Airlines, was serving Twin Falls with flights from Salt Lake City and Pocatello operated with Piper Navajo prop aircraft while Air Idaho was continuing to operate flights from Salt Lake City and Sun Valley with the de Havilland Heron. Cascade Airways briefly served Twin Falls in 1980 with nonstop flights to Boise and Salt Lake City operated with Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante commuter turboprops. In 1981, Mountain West Airlines-Idaho was operating nonstop flights to Boise with Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante turboprops. Skywest Airlines began serving Twin Falls as an independent commuter airline during the early 1980s and by 1983 was operating nonstop flights to Salt Lake City and Pocatello with Swearingen Metro III commuter propjets. Also in 1983, Transwestern Airlines was operating nonstop flights to Boise and Salt Lake City with Swearingen Metro III commuter propjets. Later in 1983, Transwestern was then acquired by and merged into Horizon Air which in turn continued to operate nonstop flights to Boise and Salt Lake City with Swearingen Metro III propjets. In 1987, SkyWest Airlines was operating as Western Express on behalf of Western Airlines via a code sharing agreement with nonstop flights to Salt Lake City and Pocatello operated Swearingen Metro III propjets. Western was then acquired by and merged into Delta Air Lines later in 1987 with SkyWest then becoming a Delta Connection air carrier via a code sharing agreement with Delta and this business relationship between the two airlines has been in effect since that time. In 1994, there were two airlines serving Twin Falls: Horizon Air operating code share service on behalf of Alaska Airlines with nonstop Swearingen Metro III service to Boise and SkyWest operating Delta Connection service nonstop to Salt Lake City with Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia propjets. By 1999, SkyWest flying as the Delta Connection was the only airline serving Twin Falls and was continuing to operate nonstop Embraer EMB-120 Brasila flights to Salt Lake City. SkyWest is currently the only airline operating scheduled passenger flights from the airport and has served Twin Falls for 35 years.\n\n"}

It was produced by Hanna-Barbera and first aired on Tuesday, October 30, 1979 on NBC.\n\nIn addition to the regular \"Flintstones\" voice cast, John Stephenson played Count Rockula, and Ted Cassidy voiced Frankenstone.\n\nWhen Fred wins the big prize on the \"Make A Deal or Don't\" game show, he and Wilma plan a vacation with Barney and Betty to Count Rockula's spooky castle in Rocksylvania which has now been turned into a tourist resort. Unfortunately, during the trip, Fred and Barney accidentally stumble across Rockula's old laboratory, where his unfinished Frankenstone monster sleeps, and forget to close the window when they leave the lab. Lightning subsequently strikes the machines in the lab, and provide Frankenstone with life. Frankenstone awakens Rockula (who has been asleep for the past five hundred years, thus explaining his disappearance) from his secret crypt, and the two scare everyone out of the hotel, except for the Flintstones and the Rubbles, who had gone to bed early due to jet lag.\n\nRockula and Frankenstone eventually discover the Flintstones and Rubbles, and Rockula mistakes Wilma for his long-lost bride and vows to make her his, even if it means killing Fred. Wilma initially mistakes Rockula for the hotel manager, Mr. Silika, who had dressed up as Rockula, for quite some time until Rockula turns into a bat in front of her. As Fred, Barney and Betty discover Wilma's absence and begin searching for her, Wilma flees and a long cat-and-mouse chase ensues all over the castle. Rockula finds and corners Fred, but is scared off by Barney, wearing a werewolf mask. The couples eventually end up cornered inside the Rubbles' room. Fred challenges Rockula to a fight, using a bat statuette as a weapon, but the statuette turns out to actually be the switch for the trapdoor to Rockula's laboratory, which Rockula and Frankenstone were unknowingly standing on. As Fred raises the statuette to strike, both Rockula and Frankenstone fall through the trapdoor, and the Flintstones and Rubbles escape and return to Bedrock. Wilma invites Betty and Barney to stay for dinner and leaves the three of them in the living room while she goes into the kitchen to cook.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Rockula has flown (in the form of a bat) all the way from Rocksylvania to Bedrock. Flying through the kitchen window, he begs Wilma to marry him, promising her a life of luxury if she agrees. Winking at Fred, Barney and Betty (watching surreptitiously from the doorway), Wilma agrees to consider marrying Rockula, then immediately begins nagging him about chores, upkeep of the house, and his bad habits. Aghast, Rockula (apparently forgetting that most chores would be left to the servants) changes back into a bat and flies off, claiming to need another 500 years of rest. Barney laughs and lauds Wilma for defeating Rockula by telling him \"the real truth about married life\".\n\n\n\n\"The Flintstones Meet Rockula and Frankenstone\" was released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1989 by Hanna-Barbera Home Video.\n\nOn October 9, 2012, Warner Archive released \"The Flintstones Meet Rockula and Frankenstone\" on DVD in region 1 as part of their Hanna–Barbera Classics Collection, in a release entitled The Flintstones Prime-Time Specials Collection: Volume 1.

He began his performing career in the early 1950s, performing and studying with Clifford Brown, Don Thompson, Bobby Gimby, and later with Canadian trumpeter Maynard Ferguson. He studied music theory with Gordon Delamont. In 1968 he formed \"The Boss Brass\", a big band that became his primary performing and recording unit through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\n\nMcConnell assembled the original Boss Brass from Toronto studio musicians. The instrumentation of the band was originally sixteen pieces, consisting of trumpets, trombones, French horns, and a rhythm section but no saxophones. He introduced a saxophone section in 1970 and expanded the trumpet section to include a fifth trumpet in 1976, bringing the total to twenty-two members.\n\nIn 1977 McConnell recorded a double LP called 'Big Band Jazz'. This was a 'direct cut' LP using Direct-to-disc recording. A small number of albums which recorded direct-to-disc began to appear on the market in the late 1970s and were marketed as \"audiophile\" editions, promising superior sound quality compared with recordings made using the more common multi-track tape recording methods. On McConnell's direct cut double LP, an entire side (15 minutes and 2 seconds) was devoted to a version of Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. The double album won the Juno Award for Best Jazz Album in 1978.

{"id": "2164263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164263", "title": "Runaway Scrape", "text": "Runaway Scrape\n\nThe Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The \"ad interim\" government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna.\n\nResidents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the \"ad interim\" government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's force.\n\nThe towns of Gonzales and San Felipe de Austin were burned to keep them out of the hands of the Mexican army. Santa Anna was intent on executing members of the Republic's interim government, who fled from Washington-on-the-Brazos to Groce's Landing to Harrisburg and New Washington. The government officials eventually escaped to Galveston Island, and Santa Anna burned the towns of Harrisburg and New Washington when he failed to find them. Approximately 5,000 terrified residents of New Washington fled from the Mexican army. After a little over a month of training the troops, Houston reached a crossroads where he ordered some of them to escort the fleeing refugees farther east while he took the main army southeast to engage the Mexican army. The subsequent Battle of San Jacinto resulted in the surrender of Santa Anna and the signing of the Treaties of Velasco.\n\nIn 1834, Mexican president Antonio López de Santa Anna shifted from a Federalist political ideology to creating a Centralist government and revoked the country's Constitution of 1824. That constitution had not only established Coahuila y Tejas as a new Mexican state, but had also provided for each state in Mexico to create its own local-level constitution. After eliminating state-level governments Santa Anna had in effect created a dictatorship and put Coahuila y Tejas under the military rule of General Martín Perfecto de Cos. When Santa Anna made Miguel Barragán temporary president, he also had Barragán install him as head of the Mexican Army of Operations. Intending to put down all rebellion in Coahuila y Tejas, he began amassing his army on November 28, 1835, soon followed by General Joaquín Ramírez y Sesma leading the Vanguard of the Advance across the Rio Grande in December.\n\nStephen F. Austin was commander of the existing unpaid volunteer Texian army, and at his urging the Consultation of 1835 convened in San Felipe de Austin on November 3 of that year. Their creation of a provisional government based on the 1824 constitution established the General Council as a legislative body with each municipality allotted one representative. Henry Smith was elected governor without any clearly defined powers of the position. Sam Houston was in attendance as the elected representative from Nacogdoches, and also served as commander of the Nacogdoches militia. Edward Burleson replaced Austin as commander of the volunteer army on December 1.\n\nOn December 10, the General Council called new elections to choose delegates to determine the fate of the region. The Consultation approved the creation of the Provisional Army of Texas, a paid force of 2,500 troops. Houston was named commander-in-chief of the new army and issued a recruitment Proclamation on December 12.\nThe volunteer army under Burleson disbanded on December 20. \n\nHarrisburg was designated the seat of a deeply divided provisional government on December 30. Most of the General Council wanted to remain part of Mexico, but with the restoration of the 1824 constitution. Governor Smith supported the opposing faction who advocated for complete independence. Smith dissolved the General Council on January 10, 1836, but it was unclear if he had the power to do that. He was impeached on January 11. The power struggle effectively shut down the government.\n\nThe Convention of 1836 met at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1. The following day, the 59 delegates created the Republic of Texas by affixing their signatures to the Texas Declaration of Independence. Houston's military authority was expanded on March 4, to include \"the land forces of the Texian army both Regular, Volunteer, and Militia.\" The delegates elected the Republic's \"ad interim\" government on March 16, with David G. Burnet as president, Lorenzo de Zavala as vice president, Samuel P. Carson as secretary of state, Thomas Jefferson Rusk as secretary of war, Bailey Hardeman as secretary of the treasury, Robert Potter as secretary of the navy, and David Thomas as attorney general.\n\nThe Battle of Gonzales was the onset of a chain of events that led to what is known as the Runaway Scrape. The confrontation began in September 1835, when the Mexican government attempted to reclaim a bronze cannon that it had provided to Gonzales in 1831 to protect the town against Indian attacks. The first attempt by Corporal Casimiro De León resulted in De León's detachment being taken prisoners, and the cannon being buried in a peach orchard. James C. Neill, a veteran who had served at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend under Andrew Jackson, was put in charge of the artillery after it was later dug up and wheel mounted. When Lieutenant Francisco de Castañeda arrived accompanied by 100 soldiers and made a second attempt at repossessing the cannon, Texians dared the Mexicans to \"come and take it\". John Henry Moore led 150 Texian militia on October 2 in successfully repelling the Mexican troops. A \"Come and Take It\" flag was later fashioned by the women of Gonzales. The cannon was moved to San Antonio de Béxar and became one of the artillery pieces used by the defenders of the Alamo.\n\nThe immediate result of the Texian victory at Gonzales was that two days later the number of volunteers had swelled to over 300, and they were determined to drive the Mexican army out of Texas. Simultaneously, a company of volunteers under George M. Collinsworth captured the Presidio La Bahía from the Mexicans on October 9 at the Battle of Goliad. The Mexican government's response to the unrest in Texas was an October 30 authorization of war. On the banks of the Nueces River from San Patricio on November 4 during the Battle of Lipantitlán, volunteers under Ira Westover captured the fort from Mexican troops.\n\nBy October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack. The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.\n\nApproximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution. When Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, residents of the Gulf Coast began fleeing the area in January 1836. Santa Anna ordered General José de Urrea on February 16 to secure the Gulf Coast. About north of Matamoros at San Patricio, Urrea's troops ambushed Johnson and members of the expedition on February 27 at the Battle of San Patricio. Sixteen Texians were killed, six escaped, and 21 were taken prisoner. Urrea's troops then turned southwest by some to Agua Dulce Creek and on March 2 attacked a group of the expedition led by Grant, killing all but 11, six of whom were taken prisoner. Five of the men escaped the Battle of Agua Dulce and joined Fannin who wanted to increase the defense force at Goliad.\n\nNeill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks. He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack. Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29.\n\nAs the closest settlement to San Antonio de Béxar, Gonzales was the rallying point for volunteers who responded to both the Travis letter from the Alamo and Houston's recruitment pleas. Recently formed groups came from Austin and Washington counties and from the Colorado River area. Volunteers from Brazoria, Fort Bend and Matagorda counties organized after arriving in Gonzales. The Kentucky Rifle company under Newport, Kentucky business man Sidney Sherman had been aided by funding from Cincinnati, Ohio residents.\n\nAlamo commandant Neill was in Gonzales purchasing supplies and recruiting reinforcements on March 6, unaware that the Alamo had fallen to Mexican forces that morning. When Seguin learned en route that Fannin would be unable to reach the Alamo in time, he immediately began mustering an all-Tejano company of scouts. His men combined with Lieutenant William Smith's and volunteered to accompany Neill's recruits. They encountered the Mexican army from the Alamo on March 7, and Neill's men turned back while the Seguin-Smith scouts moved forward. As the scouts neared the Alamo, they heard only silence. Andrew Barcena and Anselmo Bergara from Seguin's other detachment inside the Alamo showed up in Gonzales on March 11, telling of their escape and delivering news of the March 6 slaughter. Their stories were discounted; Houston, who had arrived that same day, denounced them as Mexican spies.\n\nSmith and Seguin confirmed the fate of the Alamo upon their return. Houston dispatched orders to Fannin to abandon Goliad, blow up the Presidio La Bahía fortress, and retreat to Victoria, but Fannin delayed acting on those orders. Believing the approach of Urrea's troops brought a greater urgency to local civilians, he sent 29 men under Captain Amon B. King to help evacuate nearby Refugio.\n\nHouston promptly began organizing the troops at Gonzales into the First Regiment under Burleson who had arrived as part of the Mina volunteers. A second regiment would later be formed when the army grew large enough. As others began to arrive, individual volunteers not already in another company were put under Captain William Hestor Patton. Houston had 374 volunteers and their commanders in Gonzales on March 12.\n\nSanta Anna sent Susanna Dickinson with her infant daughter Angelina, Travis' slave Joe, and Mexican Colonel Juan Almonte's cook Ben to Gonzales, with dispatches written in English by Almonte to spread the news of the fall of the Alamo. Scouts Deaf Smith, Henry Karnes and Robert Eden Handy encountered the survivors outside of Gonzales on March 13. When Karnes returned with the news, almost immediately 25 volunteers deserted. Wailing filled the air when Dickinson and the others reached the town with their first-hand accounts.\n\nAlthough civilian evacuations had begun in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de Béxar, the Texian military was either on the offensive or standing firm until the smaller Gulf Coast skirmishes happened in February. Houston was now facing a choice of whether to retreat to a safe place to train his new army, or to meet the enemy head-on immediately. He was wary of trying to defend a fixed position – the debacle at the Alamo had shown that the new Texian government was unable to provide sufficient provisions or reinforcements.\n\nHouston called for a Council of War. The officers voted that the families should be ordered to leave, and the troops would cover the retreat. By midnight, less than an hour after Dickinson had arrived, the combined army and civilian population began a frantic move eastward, leaving behind everything they could not immediately grab and transport. Much of the provisions and artillery were left behind, including two 24-pounder cannons. Houston ordered Salvador Flores along with a company of Juan Seguin's men to form the rear guard to protect the fleeing families. Couriers were sent to other towns in Texas to warn that the Mexican army was advancing.\n\nThe retreat took place so quickly that many of the Texian scouts did not fully comprehend it until after the town was evacuated. Houston ordered Karnes to burn the town and everything in it so nothing would remain to benefit the Mexican troops. By dawn, the entire town was in ashes or flames.\n\nVolunteers from San Felipe de Austin who had been organized under Captain John Bird on March 5 to reinforce the men at the Alamo had been en route to San Antonio de Béxar on March 13 when approximately east of Gonzales they encountered fleeing citizens and a courier from Sam Houston. Told of the Alamo's fall, Bird's men offered assistance to the fleeing citizens and joined Houston's army at Bartholomew D. McClure's plantation on the evening of March 14.\n\nAt Washington-on-the-Brazos, the delegates to the convention learned of the Alamo's fall on March 13. The Republic's new \"ad interim\" government was sworn in on March 17, with a department overseeing military spy operations, and adjourned the same day. The government then fled to Groce's Landing where they stayed for several days before moving on to Harrisburg on March 21 where they established temporary headquarters in the home of widow Jane Birdsall Harris.\n\nKing's men at Refugio had taken refuge in Mission Nuestra Señora de la Rosario when they were subsequently attacked by Urrea's forces. Fannin sent 120 reinforcements under William Ward, but the March 14 Battle of Refugio cost 15 Texian lives. Ward's men escaped, but King's men were captured and executed on March 16.\n\nUpon learning of the flight, Santa Anna sent General Joaquín Ramírez y Sesma with 700 men to pursue Houston, and 600 men under General Eugenio Tolsa as reinforcements. Finding only burned remains at Gonzales, Sesma marched his army toward the Colorado River.\n\nThe Texian army camped March 15–18 on the Lavaca River property of Williamson Daniels where they were joined by combined forces under Joe Bennett and Captain Peyton R. Splane. Fleeing civilians accompanied Houston's army turning north at the Navidad River as they crossed to the east side of the Colorado River at Burnam's Crossing. The ferry and trading post, as well as the family home of Jesse Burnam, were all burned at Houston's orders on March 17 to prevent Santa Anna's army from making the same crossing.\n\nBeason's Crossing was located where Columbus is today. DeWees Crossing was north of Beason's. From March 19 through March 26, Houston split his forces between the two crossings. Additional Texian volunteer companies began arriving at both crossings, including three companies of Texas Rangers, the Liberty County Volunteers and the Nacogdoches Volunteers.\n\nSesma's battalion of approximately 725 men and artillery camped on the opposite side of the Colorado, at a distance halfway between the two Texian camps. To prevent Sesma's troops from using the William DeWees log cabin, Sherman ordered it burned. Three Mexican scouts from Sesma's army were captured by Sherman's men, and although Sherman argued for an attack on Sesma's troops, Houston was not ready.\n\nFannin had begun evacuating Presidio La Bahía on March 19. The estimated 320 troops were low on food and water, and the breakdown of a wagon allowed Urrea's men to overtake them at Coleto Creek, ending in Fannin's surrender on March 20. Peter Kerr, who had served with Fannin and claimed to have been held prisoner, arrived at DeWees on March 25. Houston announced Fannin's surrender, but would later claim to have uncovered evidence that Kerr was a spy for the Mexicans.\n\nThe Texian army was a force of 810 volunteers and staff at this point, but few had any military training and experience. Faced with past desertions, discipline flaws, and individual indecisiveness of volunteers in training, Houston knew they were not yet ready to engage the Mexican army. Compounding the situation were the civilian refugees dependent upon the army for their protection. The news of Fannin's capture, combined with his doubts about the readiness of the Texian army, led Houston to order a retreat on March 26. Some of the troops viewed the decision as cowardice with Sesma sitting just on the other side of the Colorado, and several hundred men deserted.\n\nTexian survivors of the Battle of Coleto Creek believed their surrender agreement with Urrea would, at worst, mean their deportation. Santa Anna, however, adhered to the 1835 Tornel Decree that stated the insurrection was an act of piracy fomented by the United States, and ordered their executions. Although he personally disagreed with the need to do so, Urrea carried out his commander's orders on March 27. Of the estimated 370 Texians being held, a few managed to escape the massacre. The remainder were shot, stabbed with bayonets and lances and clubbed with gun butts. Fannin was shot through the face and his gold watch stolen. The dead were cremated on a pyre.\n\nIt would be a week before word of the Goliad massacre reached Sam Houston. The retreating Texian army stopped at San Felipe de Austin on March 28–29 to stock up on food and supplies. Houston's plan to move the army north to Groce's Landing on the Brazos River was met with resistance from captains Wyly Martin and Moseley Baker, whose units balked at further retreat. Houston reassigned Martin south to protect the Morton Ferry crossing at Fort Bend, and Baker was ordered to guard the river crossing at San Felipe de Austin.\n\nNews of approaching Mexican troops and Houston's retreat caused panic among the population in the counties of Washington, Sabine, Shelby and San Augustine. Amid the confusion of fleeing residents of those counties, two volunteer groups under captains William Kimbro and Benjamin Bryant arrived to join Houston on March 29. Kimbro was ordered to San Felipe de Austin to reinforce Baker's troops, while Bryant's men remained with the main army.\n\nAfter an erroneous scouting report of approaching Mexican troops, Baker burned San Felipe de Austin to the ground on March 30. When Baker claimed Houston had given him an order to do so, Houston denied it. Houston's account was that the residents burned their own property to keep it out of the hands of the Mexican army. San Felipe de Austin's residents did as those before them in escaping the Mexican army, and fled to the east.\n\nDuring a two-week period beginning March 31, the Texian army camped on the west side of the Brazos River in Austin County, near Groce's Landing (also known as Groce's Ferry). As Houston led his army north towards the landing, the unrelenting rainy weather swelled the Brazos and threatened flooding. Groce's was transformed into a training camp for the troops. Major Edwin Morehouse arrived with a New York battalion of recruits who were immediately assigned to assist Wyly Martin at Fort Bend. Civilian men who were fleeing the Mexicans enlisted at Groce's, \nand displaced civilian women in the camp helped the army's efforts by sewing shirts for the soldiers.\n\nSamuel G. Hardaway, a survivor of Major William Ward's group who had escaped the Battle of Refugio and re-joined Fannin at the Battle of Coleto, also managed to escape the Goliad massacre. As he fled Goliad, he was eventually joined by three other survivors, Joseph Andrews, James P. Trezevant and M. K. Moses. Spies for the Texian army discovered the four men and took them to Baker's camp near San Felipe de Austin on April 2. Several other survivors of the Goliad massacre were found on April 10 by Texian spies. Survivors Daniel Murphy, Thomas Kemp, Charles Shain, David Jones, William Brenan and Nat Hazen were taken to Houston at Groce's Landing where they enlisted to fight with Houston's army.\n\nHouston learned of the Goliad massacre on April 3. Unaware that Secretary of War Rusk was already en route to Groce's with orders from President Burnet to halt the army's retreat and engage the enemy, he relayed the Goliad news by letter to Rusk.\n\nEmpowered to remove Houston from command and take over the army himself, Rusk instead assessed Houston's plan of action as correct, after witnessing the training at Groce's. Rusk and Houston formed the Second Regiment on April 8 to serve under Sherman, with Burleson retaining command of the First Regiment.\n\nThe steamboat \"Yellowstone\" under the command of Captain John Eautaw Ross was impressed into service for the Provisional Army of Texas on April 2, and initially ferried patients across the Brazos River when Dr. James Aeneas Phelps established a field hospital at Bernardo Plantation. Three days later, Santa Anna joined with Sesma's troops, and had them build flatboats to cross the Brazos as the Mexicans sought to overtake and defeat the Texians. Wyly Martin reported on April 8 that Mexican forces had divided and were headed both east to Nacogdoches and southeast to Matagorda. Houston reinforced Baker's post at San Felipe de Austin on April 9, as Santa Anna continued moving southeast on April 10.\n\nThe Texian army was transported by the \"Yellowstone\" over to the east side of the Brazos on April 12, where they set up camp at the Bernardo Plantation. After walking from Harrisburg, future president of the Republic Mirabeau B. Lamar arrived at Bernardo to enlist as a private in Houston's army and suggested using the steamer for guerilla warfare.\n\nWith Baker guarding the crossing at San Felipe de Austin, and Martin guarding the Morton Ferry crossing at Ford Bend, Santa Anna opted on April 12 to cross the Brazos halfway between at Thompson's Ferry, with Sesma's men and artillery crossing over the next day. The Mexican army attacked the steamer numerous times in an attempt to capture it, but Ross successfully used cotton bales to protect the steamer and its cargo, and was able to keep the \"Yellowstone\" away from Mexican control. Houston released the steamboat from service on April 14, and it continued to Galveston.\n\nThe \"ad interim\" government departed Harrisburg on the steamboat \"Cayuga\" for New Washington ahead of Santa Anna's April 15 arrival, thwarting his plans to eliminate the entire government of the Republic of Texas. Three printers still at work on the \"Telegraph and Texas Register\" told the Mexican army that everyone in the government had already left, and Santa Anna responded by having the printers arrested and the printing presses tossed into Buffalo Bayou. After days of looting and seeking out information about the government, Santa Anna ordered the town burned on April 18. He later tried to place the blame for the destruction on Houston.\nBefore the Texian army left Bernardo Plantation, they welcomed the arrival of two cannons cast in November 1835 by Greenwood and Webb in Cincinnati, Ohio, funded entirely by the people of that city as a donation to the Texas Revolution. The idea had arisen as a suggestion from Robert F. Lytle, one of the businessmen who helped fund Sherman's Kentucky Riflemen. Arriving in New Orleans after a lengthy trip from Ohio on the Mississippi River, the cannons were transported to the Gulf Coast aboard the \"Pennsylvania\" schooner. The cannons were nicknamed the \"Twin Sisters\", perhaps in honor of the twins Elizabeth and Eleanor Rice traveling aboard the \"Pennsylvania\", who were to present the cannons upon their arrival at Galveston in April 1836. At Galveston, Leander Smith had the responsibility of transporting the cannons from Harrisburg to Bernardo Plantation in Waller County. Along the way, Smith recruited 35 men into the army. Lieutenant Colonel James Neill was put in charge of the cannons once they arrived in camp.\n\nMartin and Baker abandoned the river crossings on April 14 and re-joined Houston's army which had marched from Bernardo to the Charles Donoho Plantation near present-day Hempstead in Waller County. As news spread of the Mexican army's movements, residents of Nacogdoches and San Augustine began to flee east towards the Sabine River. After refusals to continue with the army, Martin was ordered by Houston to accompany displaced families on their flight eastward. Hundreds of soldiers left the army to help their families. The main army parted from the refugees at this point, and acting Secretary of War David Thomas advised Houston to move southward to secure Galveston Bay. Houston, however, was getting conflicting advice from the cabinet members. President Burnet had sent Secretary of State Carson to Louisiana in hopes of getting the United States army and individual state militias involved in the Texas fight for independence. While he attempted to secure such involvement, Carson sent a dispatch to Houston on April 14 advising him to retreat all the way to the Louisiana-Texas border on the Sabine River, and bide his time before engaging the Mexican army.\n\nThe Texian army camped west of present-day Tomball on April 15, at Sam McCarley's homestead. They departed the next morning and east reached a crucial crossroads. One road led east to Nacogdoches and eventually the Sabine River and Louisiana, while the other road led southeast to Harrisburg. The army was concerned that Houston would continue the eastward retreat. Although Houston discussed his decision with no one, he led the army down the southeast road. Rusk ordered that a small group of volunteers be split from the army to secure Robbins's Ferry on the Trinity River. Houston's troops stopped overnight on April 16 at the home of Matthew Burnet, and the next morning continued marching towards Harrisburg, southeast.\n\nWith the refugee families being accorded a military escort eastward and Houston marching southeast, the retreat of the Provisional Army of Texas was over. On the march which would lead to San Jacinto, moving the heavy artillery across rain-soaked terrain slowed down the army's progress. The army had previously been assisted in moving the Twin Sisters with oxen borrowed from refugee Pamela Mann when she believed the army was fleeing towards Nacogdoches. When she learned the army was headed towards Harrisburg and a confrontation with the Mexican army, she reclaimed her oxen. The Texian army had expanded to twenty-six companies by the time they reached Harrisburg on April 18 and saw the destruction Santa Anna had left behind.\n\nOn orders of Santa Anna after the burning of Harrisburg, Almonte went in pursuit of the \"ad interim\" government at New Washington. During their flight the Republic officials switched from steamer to ferry to skiff. On the final leg of the trip, Almonte finally had them in his sights, but refused to fire after he saw Mrs. Burnet and her children on the skiff. In addition to letting the government get away one more time, Almonte's spies had misread Houston's troop movements and Santa Anna was told that the Texian army was still retreating eastward, this time through Lynchburg.\n\nNew Washington was looted and burned on April 20 by Mexican troops, and as many as 5,000 civilians fled, either by boat or across land. Those attempting to cross the San Jacinto River were bottlenecked for three days, and the vicinity around the crossing transformed into a refugee camp. Burnet ordered government assistance all across Texas for fleeing families.\n\nIn a troop movement that took all night on a makeshift raft, the Texian army crossed Buffalo Bayou at Lynchburg April 19 with 930 soldiers, leaving behind 255 others as guards or for reasons of illness. The idea had been floated of leaving the Twin Sisters behind as protection, but Neill was adamant that the cannons be taken into the battle. In an April 20 skirmish the day before the main battle Neill was severely wounded, and George Hockley took command of the heavy artillery. Estimates of the Mexican army troop strength on the day of the main battle range from 1,250 to 1,500.\n\nThe Texians attacked in the afternoon of April 21 while Santa Anna was still under the misconception that Houston was actually retreating. He had allowed his army time to relax and feed their horses, while he took a nap. When he was awakened by the attack, he immediately fled on horseback, but was later captured when Sergeant James Austin Sylvester found him hiding in the grass. Houston's own account was that the battle lasted \"about eighteen minutes\", before apprehending prisoners and confiscating armaments. When the Twin Sisters went up against the Mexican army's Golden Standard cannon, they performed so well that Hockley's unit was able to capture the Mexican cannon.\n\nThe \"Yellowstone\" saw war service for the Republic one more time on May 7, when it transported Houston and his prisoner Santa Anna, along with the government Santa Anna tried to extinguish, to Galveston Island. From there, the government and Santa Anna traveled to Velasco for the signing of the treaties. Houston had suffered a serious wound during the battle, and on May 28 boarded the schooner \"Flora\" for medical treatment in New Orleans.\n\nNot until news of the victory at San Jacinto spread did the refugees return to their homesteads and businesses, or whatever was left after the destruction caused by both armies. Throughout Texas, possessions had been abandoned and later looted. Businesses, homes and farms were wiped out by the devastation of war. Often there was nothing left to go back to, but those who went home began to pick up their lives and move forward. San Felipe de Austin never really recovered from its total destruction. The few people who returned there moved elsewhere, sooner or later. Secretary of War Rusk would later commend the women of Texas who held their families together during the flight, while their men volunteered to fight: \"The men of Texas deserve much credit, but more was due the women. Armed men facing a foe could not but be brave; but the women, with their little children around them, without means of defense or power to resist, faced danger and death with unflinching courage.\"\n\n\n"}

In his essay on folklore, written originally for the national eisteddfod of 1887 and subsequently republished, he recorded a story from Denbighshire of a cow which was said to give milk to \"any one ... in want of milk\" until a witch milked the cow dry. The cow then left, plunging into a lake near Cerrig-y-drudion, and leading her two children, long-horned oxen (which are themselves the subject of other legends), after her. Owen also quoted an earlier author on the matter of another Buwch Frech. This author translated it as a Dun Cow, and wrote that a bone said to belong to it was to be found in Gwydir near Llanrwst. Owen observed that \"we have in these places conflicting conditions, which I will not endeavour to reconcile\".\n\nThe idea of fairy cows with abundant milk which came from and returned to lakes occurs across Wales: Robin Gwyndaf of the Museum of Welsh Life lists a number of other names for them in both English and Welsh. Owen likewise linked his Freckled Cow with a number of similar cows such as one over the border in Shropshire: \"There she is known as \"The White Cow of Mitchell's Fold\"\". This cow also gave a pail of milk to anyone who came until a witch milked her dry.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2164287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164287", "title": "Carlos Maussa", "text": "Carlos Maussa\n\nCharles Celindo Maussa Diaz (born September 24, 1971), best known as Carlos Maussa, is a Colombian former professional boxer who competed from 2000 to 2007, and held the WBA super lightweight title in 2005.\n\nTurning pro in 2000, at the age of 29, Maussa won two titles and fought in several significant fights until his retirement at age 38.\n\nMaussa was raised in the Santa Fe neighborhood of Montería, a city located in the banks of the Sinú River, where he began his impressive amateur career, which ultimately brought him just nine defeats in 130 bouts. Maussa was named National Champion four times and was also crowned the Central American champion. He gained the nickname “The Apostle” by his frequent preaching of the Christian gospel.\n\nIn his professional career, while never a superstar fighter, he was a highly touted \"gatekeeper\" who helped define the careers of several light welterweight prospects.\n\nMaussa began his career with twelve victories in his native Colombia before coming to the United States. He then won four bouts in the U.S. before facing highly touted New York prospect Jeffrey Resto, described as \"perhaps the most-talked-about young pro in New York\". In this battle of two undefeated fighters (17-0 Resto vs. 16-0 Maussa), Resto was unable to deal with Maussa's unorthodox fighting style and abruptly quit in the 6th round, earning Maussa an unexpected victory. Both fighters' careers ended half a decade later with a loss to the same fighter, Victor Ortiz.\n\nMaussa's win over Resto earned him a shot at fellow 17-0 boxer and WBC International light welterweight titleholder Miguel Angel Cotto. Maussa's fight against Cotto was less successful, resulting in Cotto winning by an 8th round TKO. Following this, Maussa fought in three lower-profile fights, winning two. Then, on 25 June 2005, he entered the popular consciousness of boxing fans with an upset win by KO against WBA light-welterweight titlist Vivian Harris. This exciting victory made Maussa a new champion in one of boxing’s competitive divisions.\n\nThe bout was notable for a number of reasons: Harris was an overwhelming favorite and is regarded as one of the best boxers at the weight and Maussa’s awkwardly clever style and frequent clowning gestures and facial expressions lent him an air of amateurishness. At the beginning of the seventh round Maussa delivered a stunning left hook, KO-ing Harris. Maussa then lunged downward and punched him in the head while he was already supine on the canvas. The ropes absorbed the impact of the blow. Still, this act has led to much controversy, as the hit could have disqualified Maussa. After the match, however, the bout referees ruled that the late hit was “insignificant”, allowing Maussa to keep his title. When interviewed about this punch, Maussa claimed he didn't connect with Harris on purpose, and that his sole intention was to impress the fallen Harris in case he had any desire to fight on.\n\nThe victory cemented Maussa's reputation as somewhat of a gatekeeper for up-and-coming light welterweight prospects, but ended up being his last victory. On 26 November 2005 Maussa lost his WBA title against IBF title-holder, Ricky Hatton, in a unification bout. After a unanimous decision loss to Manuel Guarnica, Maussa fought well-regarded future titleholder Victor Ortiz, and was knocked out in the first round. Following this, Maussa retired with a professional record of 20 wins and 5 losses in a total of 113 professional rounds of boxing.\n\n"}

Many traditional Guerlain fragrances are characterized by a common olfactory accord known as the \"Guerlinade\". The house was founded in Paris in 1828 by the perfumer Pierre-François Pascal Guerlain. It was run by the Guerlain family until 1994, when it was bought by the French multinational company LVMH. Its flagship store is 68, Avenue des Champs-Elysées in Paris.\n\nThe House of Guerlain was owned and managed by members of the Guerlain family from its inception in 1828 to 1994. It was acquired in 1994 by the LVMH group, a French multinational investment corporation specializing in luxury brands.\n\nThe House of Guerlain was founded in 1828, when Pierre-François Pascal Guerlain opened his perfume store at 42, rue de Rivoli in Paris. As both the founder and first perfumer of the house, Pierre-François composed and manufactured custom fragrances with the help of his two sons, Aimé and Gabriel. Through continued success and the patronage of members in high society, Guerlain opened its flagship store at 15, rue de la Paix in 1840, and put its mark on the Parisian fashion scene.\n\nThe success of the house under Pierre-François peaked in 1853 with the creation of \"Eau de Cologne Impériale\" for French Emperor Napoleon III and his Spanish-French wife Empress Eugénie. This perfume earned Pierre-François the prestigious title of being His Majesty's Official Perfumer. Guerlain went on to create perfumes for Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Queen Isabella II of Spain, among other royalty.\n\nWith the death of Pierre-François in 1864, the house was left to his sons Aimé Guerlain and Gabriel Guerlain. The roles of perfumer and manager were divided between the two brothers, with Gabriel managing and further expanding the house, and Aimé becoming the master perfumer. The House of Guerlain thus began a long tradition whereby the position of master perfumer was handed down through the Guerlain family.\n\nAs Guerlain's second generation in-house perfumer, Aimé was the creator of many classic compositions, including \"Fleur d'Italie\" (1884), \"Rococo\" (1887) and \"Eau de Cologne du Coq\" (1894). However, many would argue that his greatest composition was 1889's \"Jicky\", the first fragrance described as a \"parfum\" rather than an eau de cologne, and among the first to use synthetic ingredients alongside natural extracts.\n\nThe business was handed down to the sons of Gabriel Guerlain: Jacques Guerlain and Pierre Guerlain. Jacques, Aimé's nephew, became Guerlain's third master perfumer; he was the author of many of Guerlain's most famous classics, which are still held in high esteem in the modern perfume industry. Many of his perfumes are still sold and marketed today. Among Jacques Guerlain's most important creations are \"Mouchoir de Monsieur \"(1904), \"Après L'Ondée \"(1906), \"L'Heure Bleue\" (1912), \"Mitsouko\" (1919), Guerlain's flagship fragrance \"Shalimar\" (1925), and \"Vol de Nuit\" (1933). Jacques composed his final perfume, \"Ode\" (1955), with the assistance of his grandson, the then-18-year-old Jean-Paul Guerlain.\n\nJean-Paul Guerlain was the last family master perfumer. He created Guerlain's classic men's fragrances \"Vétiver\" (1959) and \"Habit Rouge\" (1965). He also created \"Chant d'Arômes\" (1962), \"Chamade\" (1969), \"Nahéma\" (1979), \"Jardins de Bagatelle\" (1983), and \"Samsara\" (1989), as well as \"Héritage\" and \"Coriolan\" in the 1990s. Jean-Paul Guerlain retired in 2002, but continued to serve as advisor to his successor until 2010, when he was terminated after making a racist remark on French television regarding the inspiration for his scent Samsara. With no heir from within the Guerlain family to take over, the role of master perfumer is no longer tied to family succession.\n\nIn a decision widely seen as a break with tradition, the Guerlain family sold the company to the luxury goods conglomerate Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) in 1994. Though Jean-Paul Guerlain remained as an in-house perfumer until 2002, other perfumers were brought in after 1994 to compose perfumes for Guerlain, and Jean-Paul had to submit his compositions against those of others. Fans of the house viewed the LVMH purchase as a step towards the cheapening and commercialization of the legendary firm's legacy. Most were unhappy with the first post-LVMH release, the 1996 sweet mimosa floral \"Champs-Elysées\", composed by Olivier Cresp, whose entry was selected over that of Jean-Paul Guerlain.\n\nAmong the outside perfumers to compose perfumes for the firm after 1994 was Mathilde Laurent, who worked for Guerlain at the end of the 1990s and in the early 2000s. She composed \"Aqua Allegorica Pamplelune\" (1999) and \"Shalimar Light\" (2003, reattributed to Jean-Paul Guerlain and relaunched in 2004 following reformulation). Maurice Roucel, a perfumer of Symrise, composed \"L'Instant de Guerlain\" (2004) and \"Insolence\" (2006). As the niece of Jean-Jacques Guerlain, some thought Patricia de Nicolaï would have been a candidate for the position of Guerlain's in-house perfumer, though the presence of a glass ceiling in the company prevented her selection for position.\n\nIn May 2008, Thierry Wasser was named the in-house perfumer for Guerlain. Wasser, a Swiss perfumer who used to work for Firmenich, created \"Iris Ganache\" (2007) and \"Quand Vient la Pluie\" (2007) for Guerlain before his appointment the following year. Jean-Paul Guerlain stayed on in an advisory consultant role, both for fragrance design and ingredients. Wasser will work closely with Sylvaine Delacourte, Guerlain's Artistic Director. In 2010, the LVMH Group cut ties with Jean-Paul Guerlain as their consultant due to his racist comments on French television.\n\nRussian model Natalia Vodianova has been the face of Guerlain campaigns since 2008. Vodianova began advertising \"Shalimar\" to celebrate the perfume house's 180th birthday. For the Fall 2013 makeup collection, Olivier Echaudemaison, Guerlian's Creative Director of Makeup since 2000 commented \"Every season we fantasize with Natalia's image and invent for her a new role. For us, it is not just a model, which advertises cosmetics, but above all, a great actress\". \nIn October 2011, the company named Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh as a new spokesmodel. Yeoh is an ambassador for the Orchidée Impériale line of skincare.\n\nGuerlain's creations have long influenced the trends of perfumery with fragrances such as \"Jicky\", \"Shalimar\", and \"Vétiver\". Guerlain is among the few older houses (such as Caron) that exist solely to produce and market perfumes. Many brands in the perfume industry, such as Chanel and Jean Patou are in fact divisions of fashion houses or multinational conglomerates that license the brand name. Alongside its fragrances, today Guerlain has expanded to offer a large range of makeup and skincare. Guerlain products are available across the world at serviced counters within department stores, and at beauty stores such as fellow LMVH brand Sephora. Guerlain also maintains thirteen international beauty and spa 'boutiques', five within France (two being in Paris).\n\n\nSince its foundation in 1828, Guerlain has created over 300 fragrances.

The film stars comedian Andrew Dice Clay as the title character, Ford Fairlane, a \"Rock n' Roll Detective\", whose beat is the music industry in Los Angeles. True to his name, Ford drives a 1957 Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner in the film.\n\nThe film's main character was created by writer Rex Weiner in a series of stories that were published as weekly serials in 1979–80 by the \"New York Rocker\" and the \"LA Weekly\". The stories were published as a book by Rare Bird Books in July 2018.\n\nThe film was both a commercial and critical failure, just barely breaking even with its budget and being awarded the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture, tying with Bo Derek's \"Ghosts Can't Do It\". However, it has since achieved worldwide cult status, and it has gone under critical re-evaluation in Hungary, Spain, and Norway. Moreover, Billy Idol's \"Cradle of Love\" became one of his biggest hits on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 (peaking at #2).\n\nFord Fairlane is seen sitting on a beach smoking as the film opens. A flashback initiates, showing a roaring crowd at a concert given by fictional popular heavy metal band The Black Plague. Lead singer Bobby Black makes an eccentric entrance down a zip-line onto the stage and begins performing. Shortly into one of the band's songs, Bobby Black collapses on stage and dies.\n\nAfter the lead singer of The Black Plague is murdered onstage, shock-jock Johnny Crunch, an old friend who came west with Fairlane, hires Ford to track down a mysterious teenage groupie named Zuzu Petals, who may have a connection to Black's death.\n\nSoon after hiring Fairlane, Crunch is electrocuted on the air. The world's hippest detective soon finds himself trading insults with ruthless record executive Julian Grendel, a clueless cop and former disco star, Lt. Amos, a merciless hit man named Smiley and countless ex-girlfriends out for his blood. Aiding and abetting Fairlane is loyal assistant Jazz and a hip record producer at the head of a bizarre lineup of suspects, victims, beautiful women, and a koala as he finds himself hip-deep in the case of his life.\n\nThe MacGuffin of the film is three data CDs which, when read simultaneously, detail the illegal dealings of Julian Grendel, who was getting rich from bootlegging his record company's music and murdered Bobby Black when he found out Black had acquired the CDs with the incriminating evidence. Both of Fairlane's beloved possessions, his house, and his car, are blown to bits, courtesy of Grendel.\n\nThe first disc was with Colleen Sutton, the second with Zuzu Petals, and the third disc was hidden under the star for Art Mooney on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nIt is later revealed that Grendel killed Bobby Black and Johnny Crunch, as he considered them both greedy and stupid because they wanted more money for their involvement in pirating CD's to sell to the highest bidder, making the music industry corrupt. However, Fairlane kills Grendel by setting him on fire with a flammable alcoholic milkshake. Jazz leaves Fairlane, knowing how ungrateful he is for everything that has happened. Smiley shows up and plans to kill Ford, but not before revealing that he killed his young neighbor's [the Kid's] father. Ford distracts him and kills Smiley with a sleeve pistol. Jazz and Ford decide to reconcile, while the Kid decides to join their detective agency. Ford wins a million dollar radio contest and buys a yacht. He sails away with Jazz, the Kid and the koala bear. They're all now one big happy family.\n\nMusic being central to the plot of a film about a private detective who specializes in cases arising from the music industry, the soundtrack featured a diverse group of artists. The official soundtrack release featured:\n\nThe film's soundtrack includes Idol's \"Cradle of Love\", the video for which was shown often on MTV in 1990. The song also appeared on Idol's 1990 album \"Charmed Life\". In the video, a young woman, played by Betsy Lynn George, taunts an uptight neighbor with her advances as she dances to the music. The video also featured footage from the film playing on a television in the neighbor's home, although none of the footage features Clay (at least not his face). This may be due to the infamous ban of Clay from appearing on the music network. Alternate versions of the \"Cradle of Love\" video eliminates the film footage when the video is usually aired on MTV.\n\nRichie Sambora's contribution to the soundtrack was a cover of the Jimi Hendrix song. Yello's \"Unbelievable\" samples bits of dialogue from the film, with one notable dialog switch - where in the film, a phone number is said as \"1-800-Unbelivable\" and in the song, the phone number is said as \"1-800-Perfect\". A number of the musicians featured on the soundtrack also appeared in the film itself, including Morris Day, Sheila E., Tone Loc (as Slam the Rapper), former Ozzy Osbourne bassist Phil Soussan, and drummer Randy Castillo appear playing the Black Plague concert during the flashback at the beginning of the film and Vince Neil, the lead singer of Mötley Crüe (who appeared as Bobby Black, the lead singer of the fictitious band, Black Plague). Black Plague's lead guitarist was played by Quiet Riot's axeman Carlos Cavazzo. Not appearing on the soundtrack is \"Booty Time\", the song that Ed O'Neill's character performs during the film.\n\nYello is also credited with the film's \"music score\", and an early cut of their album \"Baby\" is used as the film's incidental soundtrack. The film's score was composed and conducted by Cliff Eidelman.\n\nBilly Idol's recording of \"Cradle of Love\" was named one of the \"Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures\" by the ASCAP.\n\nThe film received generally negative reviews upon release. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 28% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 3.74/10. On Metacritic, the film has a 24 out of 100 rating based on 13 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"B\" on scale of A+ to F.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film 1 star out of a possible 4, and called the film \"loud, ugly and mean-spirited\" but he also suggested that Clay had the confidence and screen presence for a successful acting career if he could move beyond his shtick.\n\nThe film was not a financial success during its original theatrical release, making just over $21 million in the U.S. Clay has claimed in interviews that the film had a successful first week before being pulled from theaters under pressure from the politically correct. In fact, the film played on more screens during its second week than its first, but still suffered a 53.5% drop in box office gross.\n\nThe film \"won\" numerous Razzies at the 1990 Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Actor (Andrew Dice Clay), Worst Picture (Joel Silver & Steve Perry — tied with \"Ghosts Can't Do It\"), and Worst Screenplay (Daniel Waters, James Cappe and David Arnott). It was also nominated for Worst Director and twice for Worst Supporting Actor (for both Gilbert Gottfried and Wayne Newton).\n\nDespite negative reviews in the US, the film enjoyed success in post-communist Hungary, where copies of a pirated, dubbed version were widely circulated in the burgeoning VHS market. The film's popularity in Hungary has been attributed to a high-quality dub starring iconic eccentric musician and actor Feró Nagy, which contains gratuitous use of profanity not found in the original English version of the film. Several lines of dialogue from the film became ingrained in the slang of Hungarian urban youth culture throughout the 1990s.\n\nThe film received similar cult status in Norway after its 1992 VHS release, and demand led to the film being released on DVD there in the early 2000s.\n\nIt also became quite popular in Spain, especially due to the dub by the popular singer, actor and comedian Pablo Carbonell.\n\n\n"}

She served as Canadian Ambassador to Israel from 1958 to 1961, Austria from 1962 to 1966, and Sweden from 1969 to 1973. She was also High Commissioner to Cyprus, Uganda and Kenya, and chaired the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors from 1964 to 1965.\n\nMeagher was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the fifth of six children of John Nicholas and Blanche (née Seals) Meagher.\n\nMeagher attended Dalhousie University on an academic scholarship, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1932. Outside the classroom, she was also an active member of the campus’ League of Nations Society. In 1935, she earned a Masters of Arts in French and German Literature from Dalhousie University and later took post-graduate studies in political science from 1937–38.\n\nFrom 1932 to 1942, Meagher was a junior high school teacher at St. Thomas Aquinas School in Halifax.\n\nIn 1942, in response to the Canadian wartime effort in World War II, the Department of External Affairs held special competitions as an “emergency measure” to recruit educated women as clerks to temporarily replace the officers who had left to fight in Europe. Meagher was one of twelve women who passed the foreign service entrance examination and became the first female diplomats to join the department. These women served in the roles of junior foreign service officers but were paid as grade-four clerks.\n\nIn 1944-45, Meagher was temporarily posted to Washington, D.C., to replace various diplomats who were recalled to assist in the repatriation of Canadian troops toward the end of the war. In 1945, she was then posted to the Embassy of Canada in Mexico City, serving under Hugh Llewellyn Keenleyside. There, she formally acted as Third Secretary, but her position was described as “local rank,” meaning she was considered a foreign secretary abroad but maintained her status and salary as a clerk in Ottawa.\n\nIn 1947, when the Canadian government lifted its ban on hiring female officers, Meagher passed the necessary exams and was officially appointed Second Secretary rank in the Canadian Foreign Service. After finishing her term in Mexico, she served in Ottawa from 1949 to 1953, and attended several United Nations conferences during this time. She was then transferred to London, serving under Norman Alexander Robertson, and appointed the rank of First Secretary (1953–1955) on the Canadian High Commission, and later appointed to the position of Counselor (1955–1956).\n\nIn 1957, Meagher was appointed to Israel as \"chargé d’affaires\", and then as the full-time resident Canadian ambassador to Israel in 1958. In this appointment, which she held until 1961, Meagher became the first Canadian women to hold an ambassadorial position. She simultaneously served as High Commissioner to Cyprus from April to December 1961.\n\nMeagher next became the Canadian ambassador to Austria from 1962-1966, and in this position was the first and only female ambassador in Vienna. During this time, she was also the Canadian representative on the International Atomic Energy Agency, which she would later become chair between 1964 and 1965. In 1967, Meagher took on the role of Canadian High Commissioner to Uganda and Kenya. She broke ground with the terms she served in Israel, Austria, Kenya, Uganda, and Cyprus, as she was the first female head of mission in each of these countries.\n\nShe later worked as Canada's ambassador to Sweden from 1969 until her retirement in 1973. During this time, she actively conducted negotiations with the People’s Republic of China and played a key role in establishing Sino-Canadian diplomatic relations by assisting in “[ironing] out Canada’s recognition of communist China.”\n\nAfter retirement from her diplomatic career, Meagher continued to serve in various capacities internationally and locally. In 1973, she became External Affairs’ first female foreign service visitor to Dalhousie University. In November 1974, she represented Canada at the United Nations World Food Conference, which addressed the global problem of food insecurity.\n\nMeagher also served as a member of the National museums of Canada's board of trustees on several occasions, acting as the representative on behalf of the Atlantic Canada region. At the local level, she served in several board of governors of Nova Scotian post-secondary institutions, including the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design from 1984 to 1989, as well as the Atlantic School of Theology.\nMeagher died in 1999 at the age of 88.\n\nIn light of her gender and social circumstances, Meagher’s work in the Canadian Foreign Service is generally considered to have been significant in paving the way for women in diplomacy. Many believe that her career proved that women could perform diplomatically at the same level as men, which pressured the Foreign Service to continue to incorporate more women into their traditionally male-dominated diplomatic corps.\n\nMeagher was conscious of her unique and influential position in Canadian foreign affairs. In an interview, she stated: “Not only was I the only woman head of mission everywhere I went, there were very few women members of any rank in the diplomatic corps. [...] I was, after all, blazing a trail and whether I performed well, or fell flat on my face might have had some influence, at least for a time, on the appointment of other women.”Because she remained single throughout her life, Meagher was able to pursue a full-time career in the Foreign Service, which would otherwise not have been permitted due to government-imposed restrictions on married women holding federal civil service jobs.\n\nIn 1974, Meagher was made an officer of the Order of Canada for her “career in diplomacy and contribution to international affairs.” Some of these contributions include her diplomatic service as the first female Canadian ambassador, first woman to chair a board of governors and first female Canadian high commissioner.\n\nMeagher has received several honorary degrees from Nova Scotian post-secondary institutions. In 1970, she was the recipient of a Doctor of Civil Law honoris causa from Dalhousie University, her alma mater. She has also been awarded two honorary doctorates from St. Francis Xavier University and Saint Mary's University in 1974 and 1975, respectively.\n\nDalhousie University also developed the Margaret Meagher Fellowship in Political Science, awarded to a student entering the Master of Arts program in the field of international relations.\n\n"}
{"id": "2164341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164341", "title": "Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation", "text": "Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation\n\nThe Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC) (March 1946 – 1950) was founded by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly. It was incorporated on December 22, 1947. After building the ENIAC at the University of Pennsylvania, Eckert and Mauchly formed EMCC to build new computer designs for commercial and military applications. The company was initially called the Electronic Control Company, changing its name to Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation when it was incorporated. In 1950, the company was sold to Remington Rand, which later merged with Sperry Corporation to become Sperry Rand, and survives today as Unisys.\n\nBefore founding Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation, Mauchly researched the computing needs of potential clients. Over a period of six months in 1944 he prepared memos and kept detailed notes of his conversations. For instance, Mauchly met with United States Census Bureau official William Madow to discuss the computing equipment they desired. The Census Bureau was particularly keen on reducing the number of punch cards it had to manage with each census. This meeting led to Madow making a trip to see ENIAC in person. Mauchly also met with Lt. Colonel Solomon Kullback, an official at the Army Signal Corps, to discuss codes and ciphers. Kullback said there was a need for many \"faster and more flexible\" computers at his agency. Mauchly responded by carefully analyzing EDVAC's potential encryption and decryption abilities. Eckert and Mauchly thus believed there was strong government demand for their future products.\n\nBy the spring of 1946, Eckert and Mauchly had procured a U.S. Army contract for the University of Pennsylvania and were already designing the EDVAC the successor machine to the ENIAC at the university's Moore School of Electrical Engineering. However, new university policies that would have forced Eckert and Mauchly to sign over intellectual property rights for their inventions led to their resignation, which caused a lengthy delay in the EDVAC design efforts. After seeking to join IBM and John von Neumann's team at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, they decided to start their own company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nMauchly persuaded the United States Census Bureau to order an \"EDVAC II\" computer a model that was soon renamed UNIVAC receiving a contract in 1948 that called for having the machine ready for the 1950 census. Eckert hired a staff that included a number of the engineers from the Moore School, and the company launched an ambitious program to design and manufacture large-scale computing machines. A major achievement was the use of magnetic tape for high-speed storage. During development Mauchly continued to solicit new customers and started a software department. They developed applications, starting with the world's first compiler for the language Short Code.\n\nEMCC also received contracts for one UNIVAC machine each for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. These contracts were eventually canceled after the company was accused of having hired engineers with \"Communistic leanings\" during the McCarthy era. The company lost its clearance for government work. Company president and chief salesman Mauchly was banned from the company property. He challenged the accusations, but it took two years before a hearing allowed him to work at his company again; by then the UNIVAC was seriously behind schedule. The programming to allow the UNIVAC I to be used in predicting the outcome of the 1952 Presidential election had to be done by Mauchly and University of Pennsylvania statistician Max Woodbury at Mauchly's home in Ambler, Pennsylvania.\n\nCash flow was poor and the UNIVAC would not be finished for quite some time, so EMCC decided to take on another project that would be done quickly. This was the BINAC, a small computer (compared to ENIAC) for the Northrop corporation. Original estimates for the development costs proved to be extremely unrealistic, and by the summer of 1948, EMCC had just about run out of money, but it was temporarily saved by Harry L. Straus, vice president of the American Totalisator Company, a Baltimore company that made electromechanical totalisators. Straus felt that EMCC's work, besides being promising in general terms, might have some application in the race track business, and invested $500,000 in the company. Straus became chairman of the EMCC board, and American Totalisator received 40 percent of the stock. When Straus was killed in an airplane crash in October 1949, American Totalisator's directors withdrew their support.\n\nBINAC was eventually delivered in 1949, but Northrop complained that it never worked well for them. (It had worked fine in acceptance tests at EMCC, but Northrop, citing security concerns, refused to allow any EMCC employees onto their site to reassemble it after shipping. Instead, Northrop hired a newly graduated electrical engineer to assemble it. EMCC claimed that the fact that it worked at all after this was testimony to the quality of the design.) It was generally believed at EMCC that Northrop allowed BINAC to sit, disassembled, in their parking lot for a long time before any effort toward assembly was made.\n\nAs had happened with BINAC, EMCC's estimates of delivery dates and costs proved to be optimistic, and the company was soon in financial difficulty again. In early 1950, the company was for sale; potential buyers included National Cash Register and Remington Rand. Remington Rand made the first offer, and purchased EMCC on February 15, 1950, whereupon it became the UNIVAC division of Remington Rand. The first UNIVAC was not delivered until March 1951, over a year after EMCC was acquired by Remington Rand, and too late to help much for the 1950 census. However, upon acceptance at the company premises, truck load after truck load of punched cards arrived to be recorded on tape (by what was called jokingly the card to pulp converters) for processing by UNIVAC. The US Census Bureau used the prototype UNIVAC on EMCC premises for months. Mauchly resigned from Remington Rand in 1952; his 10-year contract with them ran until 1960, and prohibited him from working on other computer projects during that time. Remington Rand merged with Sperry Corporation in 1955, and in 1975, the division was renamed Sperry UNIVAC. The company's corporate descendant today is Unisys.\n\n"}

One of the appendices lists all 168 people killed in the blast, along with brief biographical information. (There were plans to include a chapter about his execution in the softcover edition.) It is the only biography authorized by McVeigh himself, and was based on 75 hours of interviews that the authors had with McVeigh. McVeigh was said to be pleased overall with the book, but disappointed with the way he was portrayed and the explanation of his motive. Coauthor Michel said he viewed McVeigh as a \"human being with a limited range of feelings in the areas of empathy and sympathy and with an oversized sense of rage and resentment.\"\n\nAccording to \"Salon\", McVeigh is portrayed in the book as an extremist:\n\nOn April 19, 2010, a two-hour special, the \"McVeigh Tapes\", narrated by Rachel Maddow, was aired by MSNBC which was based on 45 hours of the interviews that Michel conducted with McVeigh while he was in prison. The program was criticized as providing a forum for McVeigh to air his viewpoints, and as blunting the effect of McVeigh's cold statements with flashy, computer generated images.\n\n\n"}

Other sports – notably football – have long since surpassed cricket in popularity amongst the Dutch, but today there are around 6,000 cricketers in the Netherlands. The first national association, the forerunner of today's Royal Dutch Cricket Association, was formed in 1883 and the Netherlands achieved Associate Membership of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1966.\n\nThe Netherlands have taken part in all eleven ICC Trophy/World Cup Qualifier tournaments, winning the competition in Canada in 2001 and finishing as runners-up twice (in 1986 and 1990). The Netherlands also participated in the 1996, 2003, 2007 and 2011 Cricket World Cups, and from 1996 onwards the national team entered the English domestic NatWest Trophy competition (and its successor, the C&G Trophy). In 2004 they played first-class cricket in the ICC Intercontinental Cup, drawing with Scotland in Aberdeen and then going down to an innings defeat against Ireland in Deventer.\n\nThe Netherlands enjoyed full One Day International status from 1 January 2006 until 1 February 2014. They regained Twenty20 International status in June 2014, having played their first match in this format in 2008. The Netherlands regained their ODI status after the conclusion of the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in March 2018. They had guaranteed this status before the tournament as a result of winning the 2015–17 ICC World Cricket League Championship and thus qualifying for the 2020–22 ICC ODI League, and will retain the status until the 2022 Cricket World Cup Qualifier.\n\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between the Netherlands and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I. Pieter Seelaar is the current team captain.\n\nCricket was introduced to the Netherlands by British soldiers during the Napoleonic Wars in the 19th century. Further clubs came into existence in the 1870s. The Netherlands national team played their first game in 1881. They fielded 22 players against an Uxbridge Cricket Club XI, but still lost by an innings. The Dutch Cricket Union was formed in 1883, with 18 member clubs, four of which are still in existence today.\n\nThe first national tournament was held the following year, and was won by Haagsche CC. English touring teams then began visiting in 1886 including one in 1891 that featured the author of Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\nIn 1894, the Gentlemen of Holland were the first Dutch team to visit England. The tour included a game against the MCC at Lord's, which the MCC won by an innings and 169 runs. Tours by English sides continued for the rest of the 1890s, which also saw the emergence of Carst Posthuma, who was later the first Dutch player to play first class cricket. He took 2339 wickets at an average of 8.66 in his career in the Netherlands.\n\n1901 saw another visit to England by the Gentlemen of Holland. They played five games on the tour, drawing two and losing the remainder. 1905 saw the first international game against Belgium, which finished in a draw. Cricket began a decline in popularity in the first decade of the 20th century, particularly amongst young athletes, due, in part, to the Dutch sympathizing with the Boers in the Boer War and therefore not being attracted to a game with links to England.\n\nIn 1910, the Dutch team visited Belgium to take part in an exhibition tournament, which also featured the MCC, Belgium and France. They lost to the MCC by 2 wickets, and to France by 63 runs, but beat Belgium by 116 runs.\n\nDuring World War I, in which the Netherlands remained neutral, large numbers of British officers were interned in the country, and many of these joined local cricket clubs. A team made up of these players even won the Dutch championship in 1918.\n\nThe Flamingos, a Dutch touring side, was formed in 1921, and later made several tours of England. Tours by English teams also continued in this period. The 1930s are said to be the heyday of Dutch cricket. In 1934, the first Dutch women's league was formed, and the women's national team played two games against Australia in 1937, losing heavily in both. Cricket was of course curtailed after the German invasion in 1940.\n\nThe 1950s saw visits to the Netherlands by Australia and the West Indies, in addition to their first match against Denmark. In 1958, the Cricket Board received a Royal Charter, and became the \"Koninklijke Nederlandse Cricket Bond\", a name which it retains to this day.\n\nIn August 1964, the Netherlands achieved their first victory against a Test-playing nation when they beat Australia by three wickets at The Hague. They were rewarded with associate membership of the ICC two years later.\nThe first two ICC Trophy tournaments, in 1979 and 1982, brought little success to the Dutch, who were eliminated in the first round in both tournaments. But in the 1986 tournament, they finished as runners-up to Zimbabwe. The same year, Paul-Jan Bakker became the first Dutch player to play county cricket. In 1989, the Dutch beat a strong England XI that included two future England captains, Alec Stewart and Nasser Hussain, by 3 runs.\n\nIn 1990 the Netherlands hosted the ICC Trophy, the first such tournament outside England, and again finished runners-up to Zimbabwe. In 1991 they achieved a five-wicket win over a West Indies XI, followed in 1993 by a seven-wicket win over an England XI and in 1994 a nine-wicket win over a South Africa XI. In 1994 the Dutch finally qualified for the World Cup, after finishing third in that year's ICC Trophy. In the World Cup itself in 1996, they were eliminated in the first round, but performed with some credit in their game against England.\n1995 saw the Netherlands enter the NatWest Trophy for the first time. They took part in this tournament for ten years, and their best performance came in 1999 when they reached the fourth round, beating Durham along the way.\n\nThe Netherlands failed to qualify for the 1999 World Cup, as they could only manage sixth in the 1997 ICC Trophy. However, the country hosted one World Cup match, between Kenya and South Africa at Amstelveen.\n\nThe Netherlands competed in the first European Championship in 1996, coming second. They have competed in every tournament since, winning in 1998 and 2000.\n\n2001 finally saw the Netherlands win the ICC Trophy, beating Namibia in the final in Toronto. They thus qualified for the 2003 World Cup. They again failed to progress beyond the first round in the tournament, but recorded their first one-day international win over Namibia during the tournament. Feiko Kloppenburg (with 121) and Klaas-Jan van Noortwijk (134 not out) scored the first two One Day International centuries in the side's history.\n\nIn the 2005 ICC Trophy, the Netherlands finished 5th, qualifying for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, and gaining one-day International status until the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier. Their first one-day international with this new status was scheduled to be against Kenya in March 2006; however this match was cancelled due to a Kenyan tour of Bangladesh. Instead their first ODI with this status (and their twelfth overall) came against Sri Lanka; this was their first ODI at home. However Sri Lanka won the two match series 2–0, with a then-record ODI score of 443–9.\n\nThe Dutch played their first Intercontinental Cup match of 2006 against Kenya in Nairobi in March. The game was drawn, but the Netherlands gained six points for a first innings lead. In August, the Netherlands competed in Division One of the European Championship. They beat Denmark and Italy, but lost to Scotland and their game against Ireland was rained off. They finished third in the tournament.\n\nIn November, the Dutch travelled to South Africa. They first played an Intercontinental Cup match against Bermuda: David Hemp achieved what was then a competition record score of 247 not out in the drawn match. This was followed by a triangular series against Bermuda and Canada, which they won. Their final game of 2006, also in South Africa, was an Intercontinental Cup game against Canada. They won the match by 7 wickets, with Ryan ten Doeschate setting a new competition record individual score of 259 not out.\n\nIn early 2007, they travelled to Nairobi, Kenya to take part in Division One of the World Cricket League, finishing third out of six. This was followed by the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies, where they were eliminated in the first round, though they did beat Scotland along the way.\n\nFollowing the World Cup, they underwent a period of transformation. Captain Luuk van Troost retired, as did Tim de Leede and their coach Peter Cantrell. Daan van Bunge also opted to take a break from international cricket, and the new coach opted not to retain the services of bowling coach Ian Pont.\n\nIn June 2007, they visited Canada, first winning an Intercontinental Cup match against Canada in King City, Ontario. They then won the first ODI by 117 runs, with the second one being abandoned. They then played a quadrangular series in Ireland, losing by ten wickets to the West Indies, and by one run to Ireland, with the game against Scotland being abandoned due to rain.\n\nIn August 2008, The Netherlands participated in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier. This was their debut playing Twenty20 International matches. They finished in first place in Group B, based on their run-rate. After beating Scotland in the Semi-Finals, the final was abandoned due to rain and the trophy was shared between The Netherlands and Ireland.\n\nThe Netherlands caused a sensation in the cricketing world by beating England in the opening match of the ICC World Twenty20 2009, whilst being 500/1 outsiders.\n\nThey lost their second match to the eventual winners Pakistan and did not qualify for the super 8 stage based on run rate.\n\nOn 20 July 2010, The Netherlands beat a full-member nation for the first time in an ODI. In a one-off match shortened by rain to 30 overs a side, they beat Bangladesh by 6 wickets. The win in combination with their winning percentage against other associate and affiliate nations resulted in The Netherlands being included in ICC's official ODI-rankings.\n\nOn 22 February 2011, The Netherlands posted their highest ever total against a full-member nation, scoring 292 against England, batting first at the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Ryan Ten Doeschate top scored 119 from 110 balls. However, the Netherlands were unable to defend their strong total and failed to pull off a huge shock, England winning by 6 wickets with 2 overs to spare. They eventually failed to win any of their group matches and were last in their Group.\n\nIn September 2011, Netherlands whitewashed Kenya in a short two-match ODI series held at home.\n\nIn the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, Netherlands had one win and one loss before their final game. In order to go through on net run rate against Zimbabwe and Ireland, they needed to chase down Ireland's score in 14.2 overs or less. As Ireland scored 189, this seemed unlikely. However, strong and aggressive batting enabled them to score 193/4 in 13.5 overs, securing passage to the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 Super 10s. Although they lost their first three games in the group, including a 39/10 against Sri Lanka, they pulled off an upset against England in their last game.\n\nIn June 2014, Nepal along with Netherlands granted T20 status by the ICC board at the annual conference in Melbourne.\n\n\"A red box around the year indicates tournaments played within the Netherlands\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n† The final was washed out by rain, so the trophy was shared.\nInternational match summary – Netherlands\n\n\"Last updated 2 November 2019.\"\n\n\nMost ODI runs for Netherlands\n\nMost ODI wickets for Netherlands\n\nHighest individual innings in ODI\n\nBest bowling figures in an innings in ODI\n\nODI record versus other nations\n\n\"Records complete to ODI #4167.

It is probably best known worldwide for its premium IPA, \"Nastro Azzurro IPA\" (5.1% ABV), which was the 13th best-selling beer in the United Kingdom in 2010.\n\nBy 2016, Peroni was owned by Miller Brands U.K. of SABMiller. As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold Peroni to Asahi Breweries on 13 October 2016.\n\nThe Peroni company was established under the founding family name in the town of Vigevano, Italy, in 1846. \nDue to booming business, a second brewery was built in Rome. The company was moved to Rome by Giovanni Peroni in 1864, six years prior to Rome becoming the Italian capital in 1870. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the company became one of the most prominent brewing companies in the newly unified Italian nation.\n\nIn the 1960s and through their expansion, Peroni Nastro Azzurro launched numerous successful advertising campaigns, keeping a strong focus upon the sea and sailing world; each campaign featuring a model styled in a sailer outfit and hat. \n\nBy the 1990s, both the Peroni brand name and product line were distributed and known worldwide. The London-based brewing giant SABMiller bought the company in 2003, making it one of the few international brands in its portfolio.\n\nPeroni was bought from SABMiller by the Japanese brewing giant Asahi in February 2016.\n\nBeers under the Peroni brand include: \"Crystall\", a 5.6% abv pale lager; \"Peroni Gran Riserva\", a 6.6% abv strong lager; \"Peroncino\", a 5% pale lager; \"Peroni Leggera\", a 3.5% pale lager. The company also produces the \"Wuhrer\" brand – a 4.7% pale lager launched in Brescia in 1829. The main brands are \"Peroni\" and \"Nastro Azzurro\".\n\n\"Peroni\" is the Peroni company's original brand. According to Assobirra, it is the best selling beer in Italy. It is 4.7% abv and made with barley malt, maize, hop pellets and hop extract. By the 1950s and 1960s, \"Peroni\" was the most recognized brand of beer throughout the Italian peninsula and in 2019 was one of the five most popular Italian beers in the world.\n\n\"Nastro Azzurro\" is a 5.1% alcohol by volume pale lager. Launched in 1963, it is the Peroni Brewery's premium lager brand. The name means \"Blue Ribbon\" in Italian, in honor of the Blue Riband won by Italian ocean liner SS \"Rex\" in 1933. Nastro Azzurro has also sponsored teams in Grand Prix motorcycle racing. In 1997 they sponsored a 125cc Aprilia team with rider Valentino Rossi, who won the championship in that season. In 2000 and 2001 they sponsored a 500cc Honda team, again with Rossi as the rider.\n\n"}

He pioneered the use of scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to study surface chemistry on the atomic scale, and establish the relation between chemical reactivity and local electronic structure. He demonstrated device-like behavior on the atomic scale, observed electron confinement and interference effects at surfaces. He also manipulated covalently bonded atoms with atomic precision. More recently, Avouris has made critical discoveries, both experimental and theoretical, on the electronics and photonics of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene, and has laid the foundations of future carbon-based nanotechnology.\n\nIn 1998 Avouris’ team at IBM independently demonstrated the very first molecular transistor based on a single CNT. Subsequently, he optimized the design and performance of the CNT field-effect transistors, enabling them to outperform silicon devices. Avouris and co-workers then produced the first CNT logic-gates and integrated circuits based on CNTs. They showed that transport in CNTs is controlled by Schottky barriers, found ways to dope CNTs, and analyzed the role of inelastic phonon scattering. Avouris and his group demonstrated, for the first time, electrically generated light emission and photoconductivity from CNTs, and analyzed theoretically the properties of CNT excitons. He studied in detail the mechanisms of photo- and current-induced excitation of these one-dimensional systems and opened up the possibility of a unified electronic and optoelectronic technology based on the same carbon materials.\n\n\n\n"}

They have been described as Ireland's first punk band. Initially active 1976-1981, the band had a brief reunion in 1987-1988, and reformed in 2003 until the death of founding member Philip Chevron in 2013, with remaining members continuing as Trouble Pilgrims.\n\nThe band formed in 1976 in Dublin, and consisted of Philip \"Chevron\" Ryan, Pete Holidai, Steve \"Rapid\" Averill, Jimmy \"Crashe\" Wynne and Mark \"Megaray\" Horgan. Founded during punk's first wave, they are generally regarded as Ireland's first punk band. They signed to Chiswick Records and released the album \"TV Tube Heart\" in 1977. Their first single \"Television Screen\" was the first and only punk record to make the Irish top 20, and was featured on many punk compilation albums over the next few years. The band toured Ireland and the UK, including stint opening for Thin Lizzy on the UK leg of their 1977 Bad Reputation tour, and a headlining UK tour of their own in 1978. Shortening their name to \"The Radiators\", the band released their second album,\"Ghostown\", in 1979. Produced by Tony Visconti, \"Ghostown\" received critical acclaim, but failed to sell well. After a move to London, the band disbanded in 1981.\n\nAfter some solo recording, Philip Chevron went on to join The Pogues. Steve Averill became a successful designer in the 1980s, known for his work for the band U2. In 1987 The Radiators reformed for one gig, an AIDS benefit in Dublin. The Chevron-penned song \"Under Clery's Clock\", a love song and a protest against homophobia, is premiered at the show and released as a single the following year.\n\nThe band reunited in December 2003, using the name \"The Radiators Plan 9\". Original members Chevron, Holidai, and Rapid were joined by former Pogue Cait O'Riordan on bass and vocals, and Johnny Bonnie on drums. The band played three shows, including a Joe Strummer tribute and an appearance at the Oxegen Festival, as well as making several live radio appearances. Some of these performances were compiled onto the \"Television Screen 2004\" EP, released on the 625 record label. \"The Summer Season\" EP, which included two new songs, was released in 2005. O'Riordan departed the band, replaced by new bass player Jesse Booth in February 2006. Reverting to the name \"The Radiators From Space\", the band released their third studio album \"Trouble Pilgrim\" in October 2006. On 21 December 2006, they played at 'The Point', Dublin, as a special guest of The Pogues. The band's fourth album, \"Sound City Beat\", a collection of cover versions of songs by older Irish bands, was released in 2012.\n\nMembers of the band began performing as Trouble Pilgrims after member Philip Chevron became ill with throat cancer and was unable to participate in live work. The band played, including with guest vocalist Gavin Friday and guitarist Brush Shiels, at a tribute concert for Chevron on August 24, 2013 at the Olympia Theatre (Dublin). Philip Chevron died October 8, 2013, effectively ending the band, although remaining members have continued as Trouble Pilgrims.\n\nThe song \"Television Screen\", as covered by Centipede on the Roof, became title theme to the comedy TV series \"The Blizzard of Odd\" (2001–05).

{"id": "2164374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164374", "title": "Letter of Jeremiah", "text": "Letter of Jeremiah\n\nThe Letter of Jeremiah, also known as the Epistle of Jeremiah, is a deuterocanonical book of the Old Testament; this letter purports to have been written by Jeremiah to the Jews who were about to be carried away as captives to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. It is included in Roman Catholic Bibles as the final chapter of the Book of Baruch. It is also included in Orthodox Bibles as a separate book..\n\nAccording to the text of the letter, the author is the biblical prophet Jeremiah. The biblical Book of Jeremiah itself contains the words of a letter sent by Jeremiah \"from Jerusalem\" to the \"captives\" in Babylon (). The Letter of Jeremiah portrays itself as a similar piece of correspondence.\n\nAs E. H. Gifford puts it, \"The fact that Jeremiah had written one such letter to the captives seems to have suggested the idea of dignifying by his name another letter not written in reality till many ages after his death.\" Against the traditional view, most contemporary scholars agree that the author was not Jeremiah: one exception is the Roman Catholic commentator F. H. Reusch. The chief arguments put forward are literary quality, as well as the religious depth and sensitivity. J. T. Marshall adds that the use of \"seven generations\" (v. 3) rather than \"seventy years\" (Jer 29:10) for the duration of the exile \"points away from Jeremiah towards one who deplored the long exile\". The author may have been a Hellenistic Jew who lived in Alexandria, but it is difficult to say with certainty. The earliest manuscripts containing the Epistle of Jeremiah are all in Greek. The earliest Greek fragment (1st century BC) was discovered in Qumran. Gifford reports that in his time \"the great majority of competent and impartial critics\" considered Greek to be the original language. As one of these critics O. F. Fritzsche put it, \"If any one of the Apocryphal books was composed in Greek, this certainly was.\" The strongest dissenter from this majority view was C. J. Ball, who marshalled the most compelling argument for a Hebrew original. However, Yale Semitic scholar C. C. Torrey was not persuaded: \"If the examination by a scholar of Ball's thoroughness and wide learning can produce nothing better than this, it can be said with little hesitation that the language was probably not Hebrew.\" Torrey's own conclusion was that the work was originally composed in Aramaic. In recent years the tide of opinion has shifted and now the consensus is that the \"letter\" was originally composed in Hebrew (or Aramaic).\n\nThe date of this work is uncertain. Most scholars agree that it is dependent on certain biblical passages, notably Isa 44:9–20, 46:5–7, and thus can be no earlier than 540 BC. Since a fragment (7Q2) was identified among the scrolls in Qumran Cave 7, it can be no later than 100 BC. Further support for this terminus ad quem may be found in a possible reference to the letter in 2 Maccabees 2:1–3.\n\nAs mentioned above, the use of \"seven generations\" rather than \"seventy years\" points to a later period. Ball calculates the date to be c. 307 – 317 BC. Tededche notes: \"It is well known that many Jews were attracted to alien cults throughout the Greek period, 300 BC onward, so that the warning in the letter might have been uttered any time during this period.\"\n\nAlthough the \"letter\" is included as a discrete unit in the Septuagint, there is no evidence of it ever having been canonical in the Masoretic tradition.\n\nThe earliest evidence we have of the question of its canonicity arising in Christian tradition is in the work of Origen of Alexandria, as reported by Eusebius in his \"Church History\". Origen listed Lamentations and the Letter of Jeremiah as one unit with the Book of Jeremiah proper, among \"the canonical books as the Hebrews have handed them down,\" though scholars agree that this was surely a slip.\n\nEpiphanius of Salamis in his \"Panarion\" writes that Jews had in their books the deuterocanonical Epistle of Jeremiah and Baruch, both combined with Jeremiah and Lamentations in only one book.\n\nAthanasius of Alexandria mentions the same: he includes the deuterocanonical Epistle of Jeremiah and Baruch as a part of the Old Testament Canon, both combined with Jeremiah and Lamentations in only one book.\n\nCyril of Jerusalem states in his list of canonical books \"of Jeremiah one, including Baruch and Lamentations and the Epistle\"\n\nThe Synod of Laodicea (4th Century) wrote that Jeremiah, and Baruch, the Lamentations, and the Epistle are canonical in only one book.\n\nJerome provided the majority of the translation work for the vulgar (popular) Latin translation of the Bible, called the Vulgate Bible. In view of the fact that no Hebrew text was available, Jerome refused to consider the Epistle of Jeremiah, as the other books he called apocryphal, canonical.\n\nDespite Jerome's reservations, the epistle was included as chapter 6 of the Book of Baruch in the Old Testament of the Vulgate. The King James Version follows the same practice, while placing Baruch in the Apocrypha section as does Luther's Bible. In the Ethiopian Orthodox canon, it forms part of the \"Rest of Jeremiah\", along with 4 Baruch (also known as the \"Paraleipomena of Jeremiah\").\n\nThe epistle is one of four deuterocanonical books found among the Dead Sea scrolls (see Tanakh at Qumran). (The other three are Psalm 151, Sirach, and Tobit.) The portion of the epistle discovered at Qumran was written in Greek. This does not preclude the possibility of the text being based on a prior Hebrew or Aramaic text. However, the only text available to us has dozens of linguistic features available in Greek, but not in Hebrew; this shows that the Greek text is more than a minimalist translation.\n\nThe letter is actually a harangue against idols and idolatry. Bruce M. Metzger suggests \"one might perhaps characterize it as an impassioned sermon which is based on a verse from the canonical Book of Jeremiah.\" That verse is Jer 10:11, the only verse in the entire book written in Aramaic.\n\nThe work was written with a serious practical purpose: to instruct the Jews not to worship the gods of the Babylonians, but to worship only the Lord. As Gifford puts it, \"the writer is evidently making an earnest appeal to persons actually living in the midst of heathenism, and needing to be warned and encouraged against temptations to apostasy.\" The author warned the Hebrew exiles that they were to remain in captivity for seven generations, and that during that time they would see the worship paid to idols. Readers were exhorted not to participate, because the idols were created by men, without the powers of speech, hearing, or self-preservation. Then follows a satirical denunciation of the idols. As Gifford explains, in this folly of idolatry \"there is no clear logical arrangement of the thought, but the divisions are marked by the recurrence of a refrain, which is apparently intended to give a sort of rhythmical air to the whole composition.\" The conclusion reiterates the warning to avoid idolatry.\n\n\n\n\n"}

At some time between 3:50 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. on Friday, 20 October 1989 a southbound semi-trailer truck carrying a load of tinned fruit juice veered onto the wrong side of the road and collided with a Sunliner Express bus travelling the other way. The bus was carrying forty-five passengers. The impact of the semi-trailer truck resulted in a penetration of the side of the bus, both spilling passengers onto the road as well as causing trauma for passengers within the bus interior. At the time, this crash was the worst in Australian road transport history in terms of number of deaths.\n\nThe driver of the truck, who was among the dead, was found to have a high concentration of ephedrine in his blood, a stimulant similar in effect to the amphetamines. The concentration found was 80 times in excess of the normal therapeutic level, even for chronic users. It was subsequently found that the truck driver used ephedrine to stay awake and alert, a then common usage by long distance drivers.\n\nThis crash was one of several on the Pacific Highway involving buses during a relatively brief period. Less than five months previously, another bus had run off the road, with no fatalities; only two months later, on 22 December 1989, the Kempsey bus crash involving two buses killed 35 passengers.\n\nThe inquest into the Grafton bus crash was conducted by means of two sets of hearings in early 1990. The first hearings established the specific causes of the crash, and the second hearings examined matters relevant to road safety in Australia: speed limits on undivided highways; speed limiters in motor vehicles, particularly in heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses; drivers having multiple licences from different Australian jurisdictions; the transfer of driver and vehicle information among Australian states and territories; the collection, collation, analysis and reporting of road crash statistics; driver fatigue, including drowsiness and obstructive sleep apnoea; the regulation of driving hours for truck and bus drivers; drugged driving; aftermarket fitment of bullbars on motor vehicles; construction standards for buses and bus seats; the use of multi-combination heavy vehicles such as B-double trucks and road trains; mass and dimension standards for trucks; the use of radar detector devices to avoid police speed enforcement; road safety advertising and education; and general matters associated with road construction and national road transport and road freight policies.\n\nThe response to these incidents was an effort in Australia, and particularly in New South Wales, to better regulate the heavy transport industry. This included banning \"stay-awake\" drugs, limiting uninterrupted driving time and mandating rest periods. The design standards of long-distance buses and their safety equipment were also reviewed and a proposal made to upgrade the Pacific Highway to a divided road all the way between Sydney and Brisbane.\n\nThere is a memorial to the travellers involved in the Grafton Bus Disaster located on a closed-off section of the old Pacific Highway at Cowper.\n\nThis accident and the Kempsey bus crash eight weeks later were described as \"arguably Australia’s most catastrophic examples of high consequence/low probability incidents in the bus industry\" in a bus safety discussion document.\n\nThe bus involved in the accident belonged to Sunliner Express. The coroner’s report cleared the bus of any responsibility for the accident. The bus company was liquidated in 1991 and the owners later founded Transit Systems in 1995.\n\n\n"}

The show began to air on CTV in Canada before being picked up by Viacom-owned teen channel The N, now TeenNick, in the United States. The show became the second most popular series on The N with \"\", another show also produced by Schuyler and Stohn, ranking as most popular.\n\nIn 2005, after its first season, \"Instant Star\" was nominated for three Gemini Awards in the category of Best Children's or Youth Fiction Program or Series. Nominations included: (1) Best Series; (2) Best Performance (Alexz Johnson); and (3) Best Direction (Graeme Campbell). The show won the award for Best Direction for the episode \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\".\n\nOn August 28, 2007, the show received three more Gemini Award nominations in the category of Best Children's or Youth Program or series. Alexz Johnson was again nominated for Best Performance (for the episode, \"I Fought the Law\"), and there were two more nominations for Best Direction - Graeme Campbell (for \"I Fought the Law\"), and Pat Williams (for \"Personality Crisis\").\n\nFour seasons of the show (each with 13 episodes) were produced. CTV and The N both pulled funding following the fourth season, and the execs chose to end the show. The show was initially ended after its fifth season. Upsetting fans started a petition. The fourth and final season of the show ended on June 26, 2008, in the United States. Reruns continue on CTV in a Saturday morning timeslot.\n\nIn each episode of the show, Jude Harrison must deal with the issues and challenges of both her musical career and her personal life, as one weaves into the other. She also faces dilemmas and choices in her relationships, dividing her feelings between the loves in her life, while also recording with G-Major Records. These people are important to her music - the one thread that ties her life together. Her best moments are when she is working with others in creating and performing her music. In addition to her music and her loves, there is much else going on in her personal life and in the lives of those around her.\n\nEach episode of the series features a new song performed by Alexz Johnson. Usually, the song is about something that occurs in the episode. However, in some episodes, there is no direct explanation to the lyrics; sometimes it's just a song. Some episodes can feature more than one song, but there is only one song per episode that is to be featured on the soundtrack for that season. For instance, there are 13 episodes per season, which means there are 13 main songs. One of the songs, \"Perfect,\" was written by Canadian synth pop artist Lights.\n\nAlexz Johnson recorded the vocals on the first and second soundtracks, while even co-writing some of the songs with her brother Brendan. For the third and fourth soundtracks, Alexz wasn't featured for all of the songs because of the release of her debut album and conflicts with prior record labels.\n\nJust before the broadcast of the second season on The N, viewers had a chance to see Alexz Johnson in concert in a show called \"Instant Star: Backstage Pass,\" singing two of the songs from each season of the show and accompanied by her band from the show, \"Spiederman Mind Explosion\".\n\nInstant Star was broadcast in over 120 countries.\nFunimation Entertainment released the first two seasons on DVD in Region 1 in 2007.\n\nEcho Bridge Home Entertainment acquired the rights to the series in 2010 and subsequently released the final two seasons on DVD, available in the US only.\n\n\n"}

Construction was begun in 1835, however, was delayed during the Panic of 1837. Although the economic downturn lingered until 1843, the railroad was completed by January 1838.\n\nIn August 1850, the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad joined the Auburn and Rochester Railroad to form the Rochester and Syracuse Railroad, which later merged with the New York Central Railroad.\n\nSyracuse railroad \"subscribers\" contributed $31,000 to the $400,000 stock authorized in the incorporation articles received on May 1, 1834. Among the 20 investors was Vivus W. Smith, who later was one of the founders of the \"Syracuse Journal\".\n\nThe work had been done \"on the cheap\", with low quality railbed preparation and wood rails. The Auburn and Syracuse Railroad was opened for business on January 8, 1838, with horse-drawn trains and did not use steam locomotives until the introduction of its first, the \"Syracuse\", on June 14, 1839.\n\nOnly after the advent of the steam railroad did the train finally arrive in Syracuse. Originally a mill pond on the site of the State Armory, located at the present-day Armory Square on West Jefferson Street, blocked the right of way. Until a trestle was built across the pond, passengers were no longer \"forced to find other means\" of getting into the village of Syracuse from a temporary station at Geddes.\n\nKnown as the \"Auburn Road\" (a nickname that later passed to the Rochester and Syracuse Railroad), the company erected a new depot between Salina and Clinton streets in late 1838. Work on the trestle was completed in early 1839 as well as construction of a new railroad station in Downtown Syracuse.\n\nBy late 1839, one of the trains achieved the run in 58 minutes. A year later, in 1840, the event was reported in the \"Western State Journal\"\n\nWhile passenger service constituted the bulk of the company's revenue operations, an arrangement under the existing canal protection laws allowed the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad (A&S) to carry freight as well. In this capacity, it served the Erie Canal rather than competing against it.\n\nThe depot was replaced in 1839 when the depot of the Syracuse and Utica Railroad was ready for use. The depot of the original \"Auburn Road\" was not known for either beauty or finish, presenting a \"striking contrast to its majestic neighbor across the street.\"\n\nOn 1 August 1850, the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad joined the Auburn and Rochester Railroad to form the Rochester and Syracuse Railroad.\n\nA weak link in the network of rail lines in New York State, the A&S achieved distinction only in becoming a constituent of one of the world's genuinely significant rail companies, the New York Central Railroad. It was one of eight independent small lines in upstate New York which Erastus Corning, of Albany, saw as the basis of a statewide consolidation. In 1853, this company became part of the New York Central Railroad.\n\nInto the 1940s the New York Central operated at least two passenger trains per day in each direction on the route, with an additional train between Geneva and Syracuse each day except Sundays. The NYC operated one train a day on the route until 1958.\n\nThe following were the stations served on the route in its last years of service:\n\n"}

{"id": "2164464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164464", "title": "Ekam", "text": "Ekam\n\nEkam is the Sanskrit for \"one, single, solitary\" (neuter gender), as a noun meaning \"unity\".\nIn Hinduism, it refers to a concept of monism akin to that of Brahman in Advaita philosophy and Smarta theology.\n\nA well-known statement is \"Truth is one, sages call it by various names.\" It is derived from Rig Veda Samhita 1.164.46: \"They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni, and he is heavenly nobly-winged Garutman. To what is One, sages give many a title. They call it Agni, Yama, Matarisvan.\". According to William A. Graham, \"the one\" in verse 1.164.46 refers to Vāc, goddess of speech, appearing as \"the creative force and absolute force in the universe.\" In later Vedic literature, \"Speech or utterance is also identified with the supreme power or transcendent reality,\" and \"equated with Brahman in this sense.\" Frauwallner states that \"many gods are traced back to the one Godhead. The one (\"ekam\") is not meant adjectively as a quality but as a substantive, as the upholding centre of reality.\"\n\n\"Ekam\" (Tamil: ஏகம், \"the supreme oneness\") is the term used in Akilathirattu Ammanai, the holy book of the religion of Ayyavazhi, to represent The Ultimate Oneness. In Thiruvasakam-2 it was stated that it was from this \"Ekam\" that all objects, including the separate Godheads, Devas and asuras, of the universe formed. As per Akilam, this state of \"ekam\" is beyond the consciousness and derived to beyond the state of changing and is the extreme state in which the whole universe exists. \nIn Saivism, \"Ekam\" is used commonly to refer to the oneness of God, but in Ayyavazhi the basic oneness is separately symbolized to be supreme and ultimate beyond all God-heads and powers. \nThe derivations of \"Ekam\" in Ayyavazhi scriptures are sometimes close to the pantheistic form of theology. In the mythology of Ayyavazhi God-heads such as Siva, Vishnu are said to be the godheads who have power to rule this Ekam, varying from time to time, Siva until Kaliyuga and Vishnu from the starting of Kaliyuga. There are separate quotes in Akilam for focusing Siva as well as Vishnu as capable for position. But, still the \"Ekam\" is addressed beyond these god-heads.\n\nBut when Vaikundar, is jailed in Singarathoppe, he says \"I am the one who created the Ekam and the one who is omnipresent everywhere\". By this, the theology reveals Vaikundar (God) as beyond the attributes of Ekam, which moves the theology of Ayyavazhi more towards pantheism.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Named after the founder Idriss I, the great grandchild of Hasan ibn Ali, the Idrisids are considered to be the founders of the first Moroccan state.\n\nInscriptions on the Idrissid dirham, which promote the dynasty's lineage tracing back to Ali, indicate the dynasty's \"Zaidiyyah\" Shia alignment. Some academics have described them as a Sunni Muslim dynasty. The Idrisids were opponents of the Abbasid Caliphate.\n\nThe founder of the dynasty was Idris ibn Abdallah (788–791), who traced his ancestry back to Ali ibn Abi Talib and his wife Fatimah, daughter of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. After the Battle of Fakhkh, near Mecca, between the Abbasids and supporters of the descendants of the prophet Muhammad, Idris ibn Abdallah fled to the Maghreb. He first arrived in Tangier, the most important city of Morocco at the time, and by 788 he had settled in Volubilis.\n\nThe powerful Awraba Berbers of Volubilis (or Walili as the Berbers called it) took him in and made him their 'imam' (religious leader). The Awraba tribe had supported Kusayla in his struggle against the Ummayad armies in the 670s and 680s. By the second half of the 8th century they had settled in northern Morocco, where their leader Ishak had his base in the Roman town of Volubilis. By this time the Awraba were already Muslim, but lived in an area where most tribes were either Christian, Jewish, Khariji or pagan. The Awraba seem to have welcomed a Sharifi imam as a way to strengthen their political position. Idris I, who was very active in the political organization of the Awraba, began by asserting his authority and working toward the subjugation of the Christian and Jewish tribes. In 789 he founded a settlement south east of Volubilis, called \"Medinat Fas\". In 791 Idris I was poisoned and killed by an Abbasid agent. Even though he left no male heir, shortly after his death, his wife Lalla Kanza bint Uqba al-Awrabi, bore him his only son and successor, Idris II. Idris' loyal Arab ex-slave and companion Rashid brought up the boy and took on himself the regency of the state, on behalf of the Awraba. In 801 Rashid was killed by the Abbasids. In the following year, at the age of 11 years, Idris II was proclaimed imam by the Awraba.\n\nEven though he had spread his authority across much of northern Morocco, as far west as Tlemcen, Idris I had been completely dependent on the Awraba leadership. Idris II began his rule with the weakening of Awraba power by welcoming Arab settlers in Walili and by appointing two Arabs as his \"vizier\" and \"qadi\". Thus he transformed himself from a protégé of the Awraba into their sovereign. The Awraba leader Ishak responded by plotting against his life with the Aghlabids of Tunisia. Idris reacted by having his former protector Ishak killed, and in 809 moved his seat of government from the Awraba dominated Walili to Fes, where he founded a new settlement named Al-'Aliya. Idriss II (791–828) developed the city of Fez, established earlier by his father as a Berber market town. Here he welcomed two waves of Arab immigration: one in 818 from Cordoba and another in 824 from Aghlabid Tunisia, giving Fes a more Arab character than other Maghrebi cities. When Idris II died in 828, the Idrisid state spanned from western Algeria to the Sous in southern Morocco and had become the leading state of Morocco, ahead of the principalities of Sijilmasa, Barghawata and Nekor.\n\nThe dynasty would decline following Idriss II's death and under his son and successor Muhammad (828–836) the kingdom was divided amongst seven of his brothers, whereby eight Idrisid statelets formed in Morocco and Algeria. Muhammad himself came to rule Fes, with only nominal power over his brothers. During this time Islamic and Arabic culture gained a stronghold in the towns and Morocco profited from the trans-Saharan trade, which came to be dominated by Muslim (mostly Berber) traders.\n\nEven so, the Islamic and Arabic culture only made its influence felt in the towns, with the vast majority of Morocco's population still using the Berber languages and often adhering to Islamic heterodox and heretical doctrines. The Idrisids were principally rulers of the towns and had little power over the majority of the country's population. The Idrisid family in turn was heavily berberised, with its members aligning itself with the Zenata tribes of Morocco. Already in the 870s the family was described by Ibn Qutaybah as being berberised in customs. By the 11th century this process had developed to such an extent, that the family was fully integrated in the Berber societies of Morocco. In the 11th century the Hammudid family arose among these Berber Idrisids, which was able to gain power in several cities of northern Morocco and southern Spain.\nIn 868 the Berber Khariji tribes of Madyuna, Ghayata and Miknasa of the Fes region formed a common front against the Idrisids. From their base in Sefrou they were able to defeat and kill the Idrisid Ali ibn Umar and occupy Fes. His brother Yahya was able to retake the city in 880 and establish himself as the new ruler. The Idrisids attacked the Kharijis of Barghawata and Sijilmasa, and the Sunnis of Nekor multiple times, but were never able to include these territories in their state.\n\nIn 917 the Miknasa and its leader Masala ibn Habus, acting on behalf of their Fatimid allies, attacked Fes and forced Yahya ibn Idris to recognize Fatimid suzerainty, before deposing him in 921. Hassan I al-Hajam managed to wrest control of Fez from 925 until 927 but he was the last of the dynasty to hold power there. From Fes, the Miknasa began a violent hunt across Morocco for members of the Idrisid family, seeking to exterminate them. Most of the Idrisids settled among the Jbala tribes in North-west Morocco where they were protected by the reluctance of tribal elders to have the local descendants of Muhammad's family be wiped out. In the Jbala region they had a stronghold in the fortress of Hajar an-Nasar, from where they tried to restore their power base, until the last Idrisid made the mistake of switching allegiances back to the Fatimids, and was deposed and executed in 985 by the Cordobans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Gustav's success left the family well-off financially and influenced Gottschalk's interest in film. After Gottschalk graduated with a degree in theater and arts from Carleton College in Minnesota, he moved to California to become a filmmaker.\n\nHe bought an interest in a camera shop and later got to know a nearby outfit that made underwater filming equipment for Jacques-Yves Cousteau. Equipment restrictions at the time made wide-angle filming difficult, and Gottschalk began experimenting with anamorphic lens equipment patented by Henri Chrétien. In 1953, the CinemaScope process, based on Chrétien's patents, was purchased and named by 20th Century Fox. While the camera lenses were now available, the process required projection lenses as well. Gottschalk teamed up with several colleagues and began offering projection lenses under the name Panavision, which used prismatic rather than cylindrical optics. This led to a successful expansion into lenses for cameras which are still widely used.\n\nGottschalk was a two time Academy Award winner.

The next week, however, Casey was back in the top three following a performance on \"I'll Stand By You\" which was lauded by the four judges. However, on the August 24 show, despite contentions by the judges that she had her best performance so far on the show, she received the fewest votes and was sent home.\n\nDuring her stay on the show, she was the center of some discussion over voting patterns, with some claiming that she benefited from regional voting, which is assumed to work to the advantage of candidates from Atlantic Canada. On the other hand, her supporters pointed to one episode of the show where there had been a glitch in the Aliant telephone system which kept much of New Brunswick from voting that night, yet she still placed in the top half. (New Brunswick accounts for less than 3% of the Canadian population.)\n\nArguments over regional voting have been a staple of discussion since the inception of Canadian Idol and have continued into the 2006 season, with some believing that Brandon Jones from New Brunswick and Craig Sharpe from Newfoundland have benefited from regional voting. Candidates who have been assumed to benefit from regional voting have also been high on the list of those targeted by the web site, \"Vote for the Worst\".\n\nCasey LeBlanc made it to the top 5 in the competition. On September 25, 2005, the Town of Nackawic celebrated her success by naming a street after her. A section of Route 105 running near the town is now known as Casey Way. On that day, Casey was honored at a celebration in the park. She arrived at the festival by helicopter and sang three songs, including her signature theme, \"Bring It On Home\". In October 2006, persons unknown made off with one of the signs marking Casey Way. Two replacements were also stolen.

However, at low doses the use of potassium-sparing diuretics has not been found to produce a clinically significant reduction in blood pressure.\n\nPotassium-sparing diuretics are generally used in combination with other diuretic drugs (e.g. loop diuretics) that would otherwise tend to decrease the potassium levels to potentially dangerous low levels (hypokalemia). The combination therefore helps maintain a normal reference range for potassium.\n\nOn their own this group of drugs may raise potassium levels beyond the normal range, termed hyperkalemia, which risks potentially fatal arrhythmias.\n\nThe potassium-sparing diuretics are competitive antagonists that either compete with aldosterone for intracellular cytoplasmic receptor sites, or directly block sodium channels (specifically epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) by amiloride). The former prevents the production of proteins that are normally synthesized in reaction to aldosterone. These mediator proteins are not produced, and so stimulation of sodium-potassium exchange sites in the collection tubule does not occur. This prevents sodium re-absorption and potassium and hydrogen ion secretion in the late distal tubule and collecting duct of a nephron in the kidneys.\n\nPotassium-sparing diuretics do not share any obvious chemical similarities, except for the steroid-structure of the aldosterone antagonists.

The magnetic tape format became the broadcasting standard in continental Europe, but adoption was limited in the United States and United Kingdom, where the Type C videotape VTR met with greater success.\n\nThe tape speed allowed 96 minutes on a large reel (later 120 minutes), and used 2 record/playback (R/P) heads on the drum rotating at 9000 RPM with a 190 degree wrap around a very small head drum, recording 52 video lines per head segment. Video is recorded on an FM signal with a bandwidth of 5.5 MHz. Three longitudinal audio tracks are recorded on the tape as well: two audio and one Linear timecode (LTC) track. BCN 50 VTRs were used at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\n\nThe format required an optional, and costly, digital framestore in addition to the normal analog timebase corrector to do any \"trick-play\" operations, such as slow motion/variable-speed playback, frame step play, and visible shuttle functions.

She began studying agriculture in Moscow, but after a year her family was prompted by the Bolshevik Revolution to move to Germany where she completed her studies at the Agricultural College of Berlin. The Esau family moved to California in 1922, where Esau worked for the Spreckels Sugar Company on sugar beet resistance to curly top virus. She resumed her education at the University of California, Davis, where she achieved her doctorate in 1931, joined the faculty, and remained until her retirement at age 67.\n\nEsau was a pioneering plant anatomist and her books \"Plant Anatomy\" and \"Anatomy of Seed Plants\" have been key plant structural biology texts for four decades. Her early work in plant anatomy focused on the effect of viruses on plants, specifically on plant tissue and development. Esau worked at the University of California, Davis as a teacher and later a professor of Botany. While teaching, she continued her research on viruses and specifically phloem, the food conducting tissue in plants. Her treatise, The Phloem, was published in 1969 as Volume 5 of the Hand-buch der Pflanzenanatomie. This volume has been recognized as the most important of this series and a definitive source of information about phloem. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1949. In the 1950s, she collaborated with botanist Vernon Cheadle on more phloem research. In 1957, she was the sixth woman elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences. In 1963, she was promoted to full professor at Davis. After retiring from the University of California, Davis, she moved to the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1965, and continued her research well into her 90s, publishing 162 articles and five books.\n\nWhen asked by Elga Wasserman to reflect on her education and career, Esau wrote in 1973 that scientific activities dominated her career and added, \"I found ways of maintaining spiritual independence while adjusting myself to established policies. . . . I have never felt that my career was being affected by the fact that I am a woman.\"\n\nIn 1989, President George Bush awarded Esau the National Medal of Science.\n\nIn memory of her contributions as a lecturer, author and scientist, the \"Katherine Esau Award\" is awarded to the graduate student who presents the best paper in structural and developmental biology at the annual meeting of the Botanical Society of America.\n\nMany of Esau's publications are housed and available for loan from the Cornelius Herman Muller library at the University of California, Santa Barbara's Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration.\n\nEsau died on 4 June 1997 in Santa Barbara, California, USA.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2164548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164548", "title": "Airport rail link", "text": "Airport rail link\n\nAn airport rail link is a service providing passenger rail transport from an airport to a nearby city by mainline or commuter trains, rapid transit, people mover, or light rail. Direct links operate straight to the airport terminal, while other systems require an intermediate use of people mover or shuttle bus.\n\nAlthough airport rail links have been popular solutions in Europe and Japan for decades, only recently have links been constructed in North America, Oceania, and the rest of Asia. Advantages for the rider include faster travel time and easy interconnection with other public transport, while authorities have benefited from less highway and parking congestion, less pollution, and additional business opportunities. Additionally, the links benefit airports by drawing in more passengers via easy access.\n\nFor airports built within or close to the city limits, extending mass transit urban rail systems like rapid transit or light rail to airport terminals allows full integration with other public transport in the city, and seamless transport to all parts of town. Service frequency will be high, although travel time is a drawback as the services make many intermediate stops before reaching the city center and thus there may not be enough space for the baggage commonly carried by airport-bound passengers. Furthermore, luggage stowing facilities are not commonly found on mass transit vehicles as their primary objective is to provide high-capacity transport, as in the Airport, Inner West & South Line in Sydney, Australia. A common solution involves building a separate people mover from a mass transit station to the airport terminal (see below), often using automated systems, allowing faster travel time and fare discrimination, for instance Orlyval. Because they are solely dedicated to passengers using the airport, luggage stowing facilities are more likely to appear on these systems.\n\nThe first rapid transit station to connect an airport with a mass transit system was the Berlin U-Bahn's Paradestraße station which opened in 1927 as \"Flughafen\" (Airport) and was built to provide direct access to Berlin Tempelhof Airport. The connection between Tempelhof Airport and the Berlin U-Bahn at Paradestraße was however revoked in 1937 and the preceding station Platz der Luftbrücke was instead granted that connection and remained so until Tempelhof Airport's closure in 2008. Other early examples of mass transit stations located at airports include the MBTA Blue Line's Airport station which is situated at Boston's Logan International Airport and opened for service in 1952 and rebuilt in 2004, and Cleveland RTA Rapid Transit Red Line's Cleveland Hopkins International Airport station which opened in 1968 and rebuilt in 1994, although Cleveland's rapid transit is considered the first direct airport-to-downtown rapid transit system in the Western Hemisphere. Boston's Blue Line requires a short bus transfer from the airport rail station to the airport terminal.\n\nDedicated railway lines to airports have become popular since the 1980s. In many cases, there are stations at the airport terminal(s) for express, intercity and commuter trains, allowing direct travel to the check-in halls. In most cases, this solution requires the building of new track, whether it is a newly built main line or a branch (spur) line from an existing main line.\n\nA cheaper option is to open a new station on an existing line, again connected to the airport by people mover or shuttle bus (see below). While this option is commonly chosen to reduce construction costs, it is only feasible when the station is located within proximity to the airport itself. Some early examples of mainline rail stations built to serve an airport are Don Mueang Station (which opened in 1898 in Don Mueang District and which happens to be located opposite Don Mueang International Airport opened for commercial flights in 1924), Berlin Schönefeld Flughafen station (which opened in 1951 and serves Berlin Schönefeld Airport), Gatwick Airport railway station (of which its first incarnation was opened in 1891 to serve a nearby racecourse and was later rebuilt to directly serve Gatwick Airport in 1958), Brussels National Airport railway station (which opened in 1958 and serves Brussels Airport) and Frankfurt Airport regional station (which opened in 1972 and is one of the two railway stations that serve Frankfurt Airport).\n\nIntegration with intercity services has produced alliances where airlines sell air tickets that include the connecting rail service. Central Europe has seen integration of high-speed rail into airports, with domestic and international TGV and ICE services from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and Frankfurt Airport. Because of this, many airport railway stations have received IATA codes.\n\nYet another option for airports is to use a high-speed \"airport express\" train to the city centre, especially if the airport is outside the urban area and some way from the mass transit system, but a direct downtown service is required, such as Flytoget serving Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. There are various ways this can be done: it may operate on a combination of existing and newly built mainline rail or mass transit track using a dedicated fleet of rolling stock designed for airport service. These solutions often have the drawback of lower frequencies (e.g. twice per hour), and often charge a premium fare higher than other services, but are more likely to have luxury features such as luggage racks, power outlets, Wifi, and washrooms.\n\nMost dedicated railways use mainline trains and trackage, while mass transit \"airport express\" lines are usually found in Asia, as in the case of the Airport Express Line in Hong Kong. Other airports, such as Heathrow Airport, are served by both express trains and mass transit.\n\nIn many cases, there is no train station directly at the airport, usually because the infrastructure on which the service operates makes it impractical to build such a station. When this happens, a shuttle system is required for the last part of the journey; using either a people mover (often automated, such as AirTrain JFK in New York City) or a bus. The former allows low operating costs and higher perceived quality; the latter does not require specialized infrastructure to be built, and is often the preferred choice at smaller or low-cost airports. Shuttles do not provide a direct connection, and often involve a wait for a transfer to the next stage of the journey. Thus their market shares are often lower.\n\nIn some airports, such as San Francisco International Airport, the rail link may not serve some or all of the terminals or concourses directly; passengers using terminals that lack such connections must use a people mover or airport circulator to access their terminal. These circulators typically also serve parking lots, and sometimes airport hotels and off-site car rental locations.\n\nCommuter rail-type service directly from a city centre to the airport, without needing to change trains and sometimes without intermediate stops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany cities also provide a link to their airports through their rapid transit or light rail systems, which, unlike express trains, often make numerous stops on the way to the airport. At some airports, such as O'Hare in Chicago or Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta, the rapid transit train only visits one terminal or concourse; passengers must transfer to an airport circulator (people mover system) to reach other terminals or concourses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA hybrid solution adopted in some cities is a direct rail connection to an airport train station instead of to the airport itself. At the airport train station, the passenger switches to a people mover or other train that goes to the airport terminals. The same system can also serve passengers moving between different terminals and traveling between the terminals and car rental lots or parking areas. Several very large airports have rail stations near some terminals, but people movers are used by many to get to some other terminals. Examples: Paris Charles de Gaulle and Oakland.\n\n\n\n\nAnother common arrangement requires the passenger to take a train (or metro) to a railway station (usually) near the airport and then switch to a bus that goes to the airport terminals. Most medium and large size airports have bus connections from the inner city. This list only contains connections by bus from a railway station strongly associated, by branding or by name, with the airport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther cities are considering airport rail link services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2164549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164549", "title": "Test market", "text": "Test market\n\nA test market, in the field of business and marketing, is a geographic region or demographic group used to gauge the viability of a product or service in the mass market prior to a wide scale roll-out. The criteria used to judge the acceptability of a test market region or group include:\n\nThe test market ideally aims to duplicate \"everything\" - promotion and distribution as well as \"product\" - on a smaller scale. The technique replicates, typically in one area, what is planned to occur in a national launch; and the results are very carefully monitored, so that they can be extrapolated to projected national results. The area may be any one of the following:\nA number of decisions have to be taken about any test market:\nThe simple go or no-go decision, together with the related reduction of risk, is normally the main justification for the expense of test markets. At the same time, however, such test markets can be used to test specific elements of a new product's marketing mix; possibly the version of the product itself, the promotional message and media spend, the distribution channels and the price. In this case, several `matched' test markets (usually small ones) may be used, each testing different marketing mixes.\nClearly, all test markets provide additional information in advance of a launch and may ensure that launch is successful: it is reported that, even at such a late stage, half the products entering test markets do not justify a subsequent national launch. However, all test markets do suffer from a number of disadvantages:\nIt has to be recognized that the development and launch of almost any new product or service carry a considerable element of risk. Indeed, in view of the ongoing dominance of the existing brands, it has to be questioned whether the risk involved in most major launches is justifiable. In a survey of \n700 consumer and industrial companies, Booz Allen Hamilton reported an average new product success rate (after launch) of 65 percent; although it had to be noted that only 10 percent of these were totally new products and only 20 per cent new product lines - but these two, highest risk, categories also dominated the `most successful' new product list (accounting for 60 percent).\nNew product development has therefore to be something of a numbers game. A large number of ideas have to be created and developed for even one to emerge. There is safety in numbers; which once more confers an advantage to the larger organizations.\nMost of the stages of testing, which are the key parts of the new \"product\" process, are designed to reduce risk; to ensure that the product or service will be a success. However, all of them take time.\nIn some markets, such as fashion businesses for example, time is a luxury which is not available. The greatest risk here is not having the \"product\" available at the right time, and ahead of the competitors. These markets consequently obtain less benefit from the more sophisticated new product processes, and typically do not make use of them at all.\nWhen to enter a market with a new product should, in any case, be a conscious decision. In relation to competitors there are two main alternatives:\n\nTo a certain extent this discussion has now long since been overtaken by events. Japanese corporations \nled the way in reducing development time dramatically, and even to halving it in the very mature car industry. To quote George Stalk of the Boston Consulting Group:\n\nThe effects of this time-based advantage are devastating; quite simply, American companies are losing leadership of technology and innovation ... Unless U.S. companies reduce their product development and introduction cycles from 36-48 months to 12-18 months, Japanese manufacturers will easily out-innovate and outperform them.\nAccordingly, the choice to pioneer or to follow no longer exists in a number of industries. The only way for an organization even to survive may be to shorten development times below those of its competitors.\n\nOne form of new product launch, which is little discussed, but is probably the most prevalent - and hence most important - of all, is that of replacement of one product by a new one; usually an \"improved\" version. The risk levels may be much reduced, since there is an existing user base to underwrite sales (as long as the new product doesn't alienate them - as New Coca-Cola did in the US and New Persil did in the UK). Such an introduction will be complicated by the fact that, at least for some time, there will be two forms of the product in the pipeline. Some firms may opt for a straight cut-over; one day the old product will be coming off the production line, and the next day the new product. Most will favour parallel running for a period of time, even if only because this is forced upon them by their distribution chains. This ensures that the new really does, \neventually, replace the old; and it may reveal that both can run together.\n\nThe considerable amounts of time and resources necessary to conduct test markets, restrict the amount of test markets which can be conducted by companies. The risk to reveal a new product design too early is another concern for companies in fast moving and highly competitive markets, which is independent from any cost & time considerations. To overcome these limitations a new type of test markets, so called Virtual Test Markets, was devised. Virtual Test Markets are computer simulations of consumers, companies and the market environment. The technological basis for this kind of test market is a multi-agent system as well as methods from artificial intelligence. In a virtual test market, new products or marketing and distribution strategies can be tested without the risk and time constraints discussed above. Another advantage is the ability to test many different products in one Virtual Test Market as the computer simulation can always be reset to the original situation before the introduction of a new product.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2164556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164556", "title": "Triamterene", "text": "Triamterene\n\nTriamterene (trade name Dyrenium among others) is a potassium-sparing diuretic often used in combination with thiazide diuretics for the treatment of high blood pressure or swelling. The combination with hydrochlorothiazide, is known as hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene.\n\nCommon side effects may include a depletion of sodium, folic acid and calcium, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, and dry mouth. Serious side effects may include heart palpitations, tingling/numbness, fever, chills, sore throat, rash, and back pain. Triamterene can also cause kidney stones through direct crystallization or by seeding calcium oxalate stones. Triamterene is best avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease due to the possibility of hyperkalemia. People using this drug should use salt substitute cautiously.\n\nTriamterene may impart a blue fluorescent color to the urine.\n\nDiabetes: Use with caution in people with prediabetes or diabetes mellitus as there may be a change in glucose control.\n\nLiver impairment: Use with caution in people with severe liver dysfunction; in cirrhosis, avoid electrolyte and acid/base imbalances that might lead to hepatic encephalopathy.\n\nKidney failure: combined triamterene and indomethacin therapy caused reversible acute kidney injury in some people.\n\nKidney stones: Use with caution in people with kidney stones.\n\nUse should be avoided if the creatinine clearance is less than 10 ml/minute.\n\nTriamterene directly blocks the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) on the lumen side of the kidney collecting tubule. Other diuretics cause a decrease in the sodium concentration of the forming urine due to the entry of sodium into the cell via the ENaC, and the concomitant exit of potassium from the principal cell into the forming urine. Blocking ENaC prevents this from happening. Amiloride works in the same way. Sodium channel blockers directly inhibit the entry of sodium into the sodium channels.\n\nTriamterene is commonly prepared in combination with hydrochlorothiazide for treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and edema (water retention). This combination is in a class of medications called diuretics or 'water pills', and causes the kidneys to get rid of the body's unneeded water and sodium through the urine.\n\nThe triamterene ring system is found in many naturally occurring compounds, such as folic acid and riboflavin. The observation that the naturally occurring compound xanthopterin had renal affects led scientists at Smith Kline and French Laboratories in Philadelphia to begin a medicinal chemistry campaign to discover potential drugs, as part of a program to discover potassium-sparing diuretics. The first clinical studies were published in 1961 and the first trials combining it with hydrochlorothiazide were published the next year.\n\nSmith Kline & French launched it as a single agent under the brand Dyrenium in 1964. The combination drug with hydrochlorothiazidem, Dyazide, was first approved in the US in 1965 and the first generic, brought by Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., was approved in 1987. In 1986 Dyazide was the most prescribed drug in the US and had $325 million in sales, making it SmithKline Beckman's second-biggest seller behind Tagamet.\n\nThe patents had expired on Dyazide in 1980, but complications arose with the introductions of generics, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.\n\nBolar Pharmaceutical was in the running to be the first to bring a generic, but its application was delayed by these concerns about whether its formulation provided the same amount of each drug; these were complicated by accusations that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA. Shortly after Bolar's generic was approved, further concerns were raised with regard to Bolar's applications to market generics more generally; these findings among others raised widespread concern among doctors and the public over whether generics were really the same as branded drugs. Bolar ended up recalling its generic form of Dyazide and withdrawing the product in 1990. In 1991 the US Justice Department on behalf of the FDA filed 20 criminal charges against Bolar for its fraud, and early the next year Bolar pled guilty and agreed to pay a $10M fine. Public concern over the safety of generic drugs was further exacerbated by a Congressional investigation into bribery at the FDA by generics companies that found pervasive corruption; the investigation had been spurred by the generics company Mylan, which had hired private investigators based on its beliefs that competitors were getting unfair advantages in getting their generics approved.\n\nMylan itself developed a version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug after the Dyazide patent expired, and used a different, more stable formulation as well as different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene) so it had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984. The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.\n\nMylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition and litigation by two of them, American Therapeutics Inc. and Vitarine Pharmaceuticals, with the FDA. Vitarine, along with Par Pharmaceutical, were two of the companies that Mylan had targeted in its investigation into corruption and it turned out that Par and Vitarine had each used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain its bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product. Generics eventually entered the market.\n\nWhile there is a lack of randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of triamterene in the treatment of Ménière's disease, the typical treatment is 37.5 mg of triamterene with 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide 1–2 capsules daily. This recommendation was given a Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) grade of C.\n"}

He was best known for his television work on \"Most Haunted\", broadcast on Living TV (2002–2010). His career as a medium was punctuated by allegations of fakery and he also attracted controversy over a number of seances during which he, reportedly, made contact with high-profile figures.\n\nBefore his career as a medium, Acorah played as a footballer, where he was once on the books on Liverpool, but his career was cut short by injury.\n\nAcorah was born Derek Francis Johnson, in Bootle on 27 January 1950 to Frederick Johnson and Elizabeth Courtney. He lived in Scarisbrick near Southport, in North West England. Acorah claimed that his first experience with spiritualism happened when he was six, when he saw his deceased grandfather in his grandmother's house. His grandmother, a psychic, would later influence his decision to become a medium.\n\nAcorah attended secondary school at Warwick Bolam, and was a keen footballer in his youth, firstly playing for Bootle Boys and then, Wrexham's academy side when he was thirteen. He signed schoolboy terms with Liverpool, at the time managed by Bill Shankly. Acorah often told of a story where he told Emlyn Hughes to be careful with his new car. When Hughes turned up late for training the next day, having written the car off, Shankly had heard of Acorah's mediumship and told him, \"Son, where did you get all this from? You leave that at home, you just bring your boots here and play football.\" Acorah also claimed that he had spoken to Shankly in the spirit world, in the years following the Scotsman's death. Acorah never made an appearance for the first team, and briefly turned out for the reserves, before being released by his hometown club. He returned to Wrexham, where he played for about a season, and had stints for Glentoran and Stockport County. After the birth of his son, he was asked by the player's union in Manchester if he wanted to play in Australia. He discussed the situation with his wife, and they made the move, where he played for USC Lion in the South Australian State League. His time at the club was cut short by injury, putting an end to his football career. On top of this, his wife suffered from homesickness, so they returned to England, but they split up soon afterwards. He then began working as a medium, adopting the surname Acorah, which he claimed came from a Dutch ancestor.\n\nAcorah's first television appearance was on the satellite TV channel Granada Breeze in 1996. During his five years with the channel, he began with \"Livetime\" before later appearing weekly on \"Psychic Livetime\". He also appeared on \"Predictions\" which started out as a showcase for various studio guests but later became a vehicle for Acorah alone and renamed \"Predictions with Derek Acorah\".\n\nIn 2002, Acorah also featured in the television series \"Antiques Ghost Show,\" and in 2004 he was presented with the Variety Club of Great Britain's Multichannel TV Personality of the Year Award.\nIn July 2001, Acorah joined a new British television programme called \"Haunting Truths\". It was subsequently sold to Living and renamed \"Most Haunted\". He worked on the show for six series.\n\nYvette Fielding, a presenter and executive producer of \"Most Haunted\", initially stated \"there is no acting on this programme, none whatsoever. Everything you see and you hear is real.\" However, significant media attention was directed at the show in 2005, after Acorah claimed to channel spirits with names that had allegedly been suggested to him in advance, such as \"Rik Eedles\" and \"Kreed Kafer\", which are anagrams of \"Derek Lies\" and \"Derek Faker\" respectively. Speaking in 2006, Fielding said of Acorah: \"We tell people everything is real, then it turns out he was a fake, so he had to go.\" His time on the show saw him regularly being parodied, most notably with Shirley Ghostman (portrayed by Marc Wootton), which drew on elements of Acorah and Colin Fry, and Wooton once invaded one of Acorah's shows. He was also parodied by Dawn French on an episode of \"French and Saunders\" and by Jon Culshaw on \"Dead Ringers\".\n\nAfter his 2005 departure from \"Most Haunted,\" Acorah filmed a one-off special for LivingTV, \"Derek Acorah's Quest for Guy Fawkes\" followed by \"Derek Acorah's Ghost Towns\" with Ruggie Media. This programme ran for three series. In 2008, Acorah took part in two series for Sky Real Lives titled \"Derek Acorah\". In July 2006, he made a cameo appearance in the \"Doctor Who\" episode \"Army of Ghosts\".\n\nIn November 2009, Acorah featured in \"Michael Jackson: The Live Seance\", in which he was shown on live television attempting to contact the singer's spirit. The programme was named the worst TV programme of 2009 in a poll of more than 9,000 Yahoo! users.\n\nAcorah's other television work includes \"Celebrity Five Go to...\", \"Harry Hill's TV Burp\", \"Celebrity Quitters\" and \"Paranormal Egypt\". He also made appearances on \"Celebrity Juice\", \"Loose Lips\", \"Richard and Judy\", \"Bo' Selecta!\", \"\", \"The Paul O'Grady Show\", \"The Weakest Link\" and \"Loose Women\". On film, he had a cameo in \"Big Fat Gypsy Gangster\" (2011), and played a small role in \"Crispy's Curse\" (2017), although the film failed to achieve a general release.\n\nIn May 2012, Acorah claimed to have received a psychic message from Madeleine McCann via a 'spirit guide', stating that the child had died some time ago but would soon be reincarnated. After widespread media outrage, Acorah used the same newspaper to publish an apology to McCann's parents.\n\nIn December 2015, Acorah, alongside Sean Reynolds and Rebecca Palmer, launched their new 12-part television show entitled \"The Past Hunters\".\n\nAcorah competed in the twentieth series of \"Celebrity Big Brother\". He left the house on the final night in fourth place.\n\nAcorah was firstly married to Joan Hughes from 1972 to 1982. The couple had a son together. He was later married to his wife Gwen from 1995, until his death in 2020. The couple were patrons for the charity Pathfinder Guide Dog Programme, a registered charity which provides guide dogs for the blind.\n\nIn March 2014, he was convicted of driving without due care and attention and failing to provide a breath sample following a car crash. Acorah had failed a roadside breath test but refused to give the required sample at a police station. He was banned from driving for 28 months and fined £1,000.\n\nAcorah died on 4 January 2020, aged 69, following a short illness. His wife later confirmed that Acorah had been hospitalised with pneumonia and later contracted sepsis.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2164587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164587", "title": "Ratcliff Highway murders", "text": "Ratcliff Highway murders\n\nThe Ratcliff Highway murders (sometimes Ratcliffe Highway murders) were two attacks on two separate families the Marr and Williamson families that resulted in seven fatalities. The two attacks occurred twelve days apart in December 1811, in homes located half a mile apart near the London Docklands district of Wapping, London, England, United Kingdom. The main suspect in the slayings, John Williams, committed suicide before he could be put on trial.\n\nThe first attack took place on 7 December 1811 in the living quarters behind a linen draper's shop at 29 Ratcliffe Highway, on the south side of the street between Cannon Street Road and Artichoke Hill. Ratcliffe Highway was the old name for a road in London's East End, now simply called The Highway, then one of three main roads leaving the city. The road was in a dangerous and run-down area of seedy businesses, dark alleys and dilapidated tenements.\n\nThe victims of the first murders were the Marr family. Timothy Marr, whose age was reported as either 24 or 27, had previously served several years with the East India Company (EIC) aboard the trading ship \"Dover Castle\", and now kept a linen draper's and hosier's shop. Marr had a young wife, Celia; a 14-week-old son, Timothy (who had been born on 29 August); an apprentice, James Gowan; and a servant girl, Margaret Jewell. All had been living at 29 Ratcliffe Highway since April of that year.\n\nJust before midnight on 7 December 1811, the Marrs were in their shop and residence preparing for the next day's business when an intruder entered their home. 7 December fell on a Saturday, then pay day for many British working people and the busiest day of the week for shopkeepers. \n\nJewell was not present at 29 Ratcliffe Highway because she had just been sent to purchase oysters as a late-night meal for Marr and a treat for his young wife, who was still recovering from childbirth. Jewell was then to go to a nearby bakery at John Hill and pay an outstanding bill. One report stated that as she opened the shop door she saw the figure of a man framed in the light. As the entire area was usually busy after normal business hours, Jewell took no notice and went on with her errand. Finding the oyster shop closed, she walked back past the Marrs' home, where she saw her employer through the window, still at work, and went to pay the baker's bill. Finding the baker's closed, Jewell decided to go to another shop in a final attempt to find some oysters, but, after finding that shop shuttered as well, she returned empty-handed.\n\nArriving at the shop at twenty minutes past midnight, Jewell found the building dark and the door locked. Thinking that the Marrs had forgotten that she was still out, she knocked, but received no answer. Jewell initially heard no movement inside, then a noise that sounded like footsteps on the stairs, so she assumed that someone was coming to let her in. She heard the baby upstairs cry out. However, no one came to the door.\n\nHearing footsteps on the pavement behind her, Jewell became frightened and slammed the knocker against the door \"with unintermitting violence\", drawing attention to herself. George Olney, a night watchman who called out the time every half-hour, came to find out who she was. Olney, who knew the Marrs well, knocked at the door and called out, but noticed that the shutters were in place yet were not latched. The noise awakened John Murray, a pawnbroker and Marr's next-door neighbour. Alarmed, he jumped over the wall that divided his yard from 29 Ratcliffe Highway, and saw a light on and the back door standing open. Murray entered and went up the back steps, calling to the Marrs that they had neglected to fasten their shutters. He heard nothing.\n\nReturning downstairs and entering the shop, Murray beheld \"the carnage of the night stretched out on the floor\". The \"narrow premises ... so floated with gore that it was hardly possible to escape the pollution of blood in picking out a path to the front door\". He first saw Gowan, the apprentice, lying on the floor about five feet from the stairs, just inside the shop door. The bones of the boy's face were smashed, his blood was dripping onto the floor, and his brains had been pulverised and cast about the walls and across the counters.\n\nMurray went to the front door to let Olney in, but stumbled across another corpse, that of Celia Marr. She lay face down, her head battered, her wounds still emitting blood. Murray let in Olney and together they searched for Timothy Marr. They found him behind the shop counter, battered to death. Murray and Olney rushed to the living quarters, and found the infant dead in his crib, which was covered with blood. One side of the infant's face had been crushed and his throat had been slit so that his head was nearly severed from his body.\n\nBy the time Murray and Olney discovered the infant, more people from the neighbourhood had gathered outside and the Thames River Police were summoned. The first officer on the scene was Charles Horton. As nothing appeared to have been taken money was in the till and £152 was found in a drawer in the bedroom there seemed to be no motive. A thief might have been scared off before he finished, but the other possibility was some sort of revenge attack by someone who knew Timothy Marr.\n\nHorton initially believed that the weapon used had been a ripping chisel. One was found in the shop, but it was clean. In the bedroom he found a heavy, long-handled shipwright's hammer, or maul, covered with blood, leaning against a chair. Horton assumed this was the murder weapon, abandoned when Jewell's knocking scared the killer away. Human hairs were stuck in the drying blood on the flat, heavy end, and the tapered end, used for driving nails into wood, was chipped.\n\nTwo sets of footprints were then discovered at the back of the shop. These appeared to belong to the killers, as they contained both blood and sawdust from carpentry work done inside earlier in the day. A group of citizens followed the tracks to Pennington Street, which ran behind the house, and found a possible witness who reported that he had seen a group of some ten men running away from an empty house in the direction of New Gravel Lane (now Glamis Road) shortly after the alarm had been raised. Speculation now arose that the crime was the work of a criminal gang.\n\nHorton took the bloodstained maul back to his station to find that three sailors, who had been seen in the area that night, were in custody. One appeared to have spots of blood on his clothing, but all three had convincing alibis and were released. Other men were apprehended in the area on the basis of witnesses' reports, but the cases against them also fell apart. A reward of 50 guineas was offered for the apprehension of the perpetrator, and, to notify area residents, a handbill was drafted and stuck on church doors.\nThe bodies, their wounds not sutured and their eyes not closed, were laid out on beds in the house. The penny press ensured that the sensational news spread throughout Britain, and the public came in droves to go through the house and view the corpses. That was not unusual at the time.\n\nLondoners were familiar with violent attacks in the street at night, and Ratcliffe Highway had a particularly bad reputation for robbery. However, these murders shocked the public because the Marrs had been a hardworking family with no apparent ties to criminal elements. They seemed to be entirely random victims.\n\nOn 10 December a coroner's jury heard that someone must have been watching the shop and residence for an opportunity. The crime had been committed between 11:55 p.m., when Jewell left, and 12:20 a.m., when she returned. Murray stated that he had heard bumping noises around 12:10 a.m., so it was decided that the killers had still been in the home when Jewell returned and had fled out the back door.\n\nAn attempt was made to trace the maul by the chip in its blade. There was no blood on the chisel, but since Jewell stated that Marr had been looking for one earlier that evening, it was thought that it was brought to be used as a weapon, since if it had been in plain sight, he would have found it. Cornelius Hart, one of the carpenters who had worked in the shop that day, was detained, but no case could be made against him and he was released. Marr's brother also came under scrutiny, since he was rumoured to have had a disagreement with him, but after being interrogated for forty-eight hours, he was exonerated because he had a firm alibi. A servant girl who had previously been let go was also questioned, but she lacked motive as well as criminal companions, and was too small to have performed the murders by herself.\n\nThe four victims were given a memorial service, then buried beneath a monument in the parish church of St. George's in the East, where the infant had been baptised three months earlier.\n\nWhen the maul was cleaned on Thursday 19 December it appeared that some initials were carved into the handle, perhaps with a seaman's coppering punch: \"I.P.\" or \"J.P.\". Those who were working on the case now had a way to try to trace the owner.\n\nThe same night the initials were discovered on the maul, and twelve days after the first killings, the second set of murders occurred at The King's Arms, a tavern at 81 New Gravel Lane (now Garnet Street). The victims were John Williamson, the 56-year-old publican, who had run the tavern for fifteen years; Elizabeth, his 60-year-old wife; and their servant, Bridget Anna Harrington, who was in her late 50s. The King's Arms was a tall two-storey building, but despite its proximity to the Highway it was not a rowdy establishment, as the Williamsons liked to retire early.\n\nEarlier that night Williamson had told one of the parish constables that he had seen a man wearing a brown jacket lurking around the place and listening at his door. He asked the officer to keep an eye out for the stranger and arrest him. Not long afterwards the same constable heard a cry of, \"Murder!\" As a crowd gathered outside The King's Arms a nearly naked man descended from the upper floor using a rope of knotted sheets. As he dropped to the street, he was crying incoherently. He was John Turner, a lodger and journeyman who had been at the tavern for some eight months.\n\nThe crowd forced the tavern doors open and saw the body of John Williamson lying face up on the steps leading into the taproom. His head had been beaten and his throat had been cut, and there was an iron crowbar lying at his side. While the crowbar appeared to be the weapon used to beat him, a sharper implement had been used to slit his throat and nearly hack off his hand. Elizabeth Williamson and the maid were found in the parlour, their skulls smashed and their throats cut. The maid's feet were beneath the grate, as if she had been struck down while preparing the fire for the next morning. Her mistress's neck had been severed to the bone.\n\nThe crowd armed themselves and stormed through the inn in search of possible perpetrators. They then discovered the Williamsons' 14-year-old granddaughter, Catherine (Kitty) Stillwell, in her bed, alive and untouched. Given what had happened to the Marr family twelve days earlier, it seemed miraculous that she had slept through the entire attack and had no idea what had just occurred downstairs. The bodies were placed on their beds and the girl was taken to a safer home. Fire bells were rung to call out volunteers, while London Bridge was sealed off. \n\nActing on eyewitness accounts that a tall man had been loitering outside the tavern that night, wearing a flushing coat (a loose-fitting, hooded garment), several Bow Street Runners were assigned to hunt down the murderer. According to one report, Turner claimed that he had shouted for help, scaring the killer away. He also reportedly stated that he had seen the tall man near Mrs Williamson's corpse, but he was also viewed as a suspect and his report was not given its full weight. \n\nEntry to the premises was found to have been gained by forcing open the cellar flap. An open window was discovered, with bloodstains on the sill indicating the murderer's escape route, and a footprint in the mud outside seemed to confirm this. The unknown assailant apparently escaped by running along a clay-covered slope, so it was assumed by the police that he would have got clay all over his clothing, making him easy to identify. It was pointed out that this type of escape route was similar to the one taken by the person who had murdered the Marr family. There were no known connections between the two families, and there was also no apparent motive for this second slaughter. As Mr Williamson's watch was missing and both crimes had been interrupted, they might still have started off as simple robberies.\n\nA haphazard task force was assembled, composed of constables from various parishes and a group of Bow Street Runners. They quickly arrested a suspect who lived in the area, had recently purchased a gallon of brandy and had recently cleaned trousers to get rid of what a local doctor claimed were bloodstains. No forensic tests existed to test his theory, but the man was detained anyway. Other witnesses claimed that they had seen two men running up Ratcliff Highway that night, a tall man with a limp and a shorter man, but the descriptions were vague and did not result in any clear leads. Local magistrates convened and quickly offered another reward of 100 guineas, double the amount of the reward in the case of the Marr family, for information leading to the capture of the culprit, and handbills were drafted and posted within the hour. Rewards were offered by three different parishes for information, including two other offers of £50.\n\nRichard Ryder, the Home Secretary, responded to public panic and pressure and appointed Aaron Graham, a Bow Street magistrate, to the inquiry. London newspapers focused on the crimes for some three weeks, and a coroner's inquest was called at The Black Horse, a tavern across from The King's Arms. \n\nTurner claimed that he had entered The King's Arms at about 10:40 on the night of 19 December and had gone to his room on the upper floor. He had heard Mrs Williamson lock the door, then heard the front door bang open \"hard\" and Bridget shout, \"We are all murdered!\". Williamson then exclaimed, \"I am a dead man.\" As he lay in bed listening, Turner heard several blows. He also heard someone walking about, but so quietly that he believed their shoes had no nails. (The shoeprint outside was made by a shoe with nails.) After a few minutes he left his bed and went to investigate. As Turner crept down the stairs, he heard three drawn-out sighs and saw that a door stood open, with a light shining on the other side. He peered in and caught a glimpse of a man he estimated was six feet tall, wearing a dark flushing coat, leaning over Mrs Williamson and going through her pockets. Turner saw only one man before going back up the stairs. Rather than become a victim as well, he then tied two sheets together in his bedroom and lowered himself out of the house. He knew that Mr Williamson's watch was missing and described it, but could not recall there ever being a crowbar in the tavern like the one found next to the corpse. The conclusion was that it must have been brought there by the killer.\n\nThose who had seen the corpses testified and the surgeon who had examined them also gave his report. The jury returned a verdict of willful murder by a person or persons unknown.\n\nA principal suspect in the murders, John Williams (also known as John Murphy), was a 27-year-old Irish or Scottish seaman and a lodger at The Pear Tree, a public house on Cinnamon Street off the Highway in Old Wapping. Williams' roommate had noticed that he had returned after midnight on the night of the tavern murders. Thomas de Quincey claimed that Williams had been an acquaintance of Timothy Marr's, and described him as: \"a man of middle stature, slenderly built, rather thin but wiry, tolerably muscular, and clear of all superfluous flesh. His hair was of the most extraordinary and vivid colour, viz., a bright yellow, something between an orange and a yellow colour.\" \"The Times\" was more specific: he was five-foot-nine, slender, had a \"pleasing countenance,\" and did not limp. Williams had nursed a grievance against Marr from when they were shipmates, but the subsequent murders at The King's Arms remain unexplained.\n\nThe Shadwell Police Office examined Williams as well as several other suspects. Williams had two pawn tickets on his person, some silver coins and a pound note. His last voyage had been on \"Roxburgh Castle\", an EIC trading ship, and he had narrowly escaped being part of a failed mutiny attempt. Williams was educated and had a reputation for being honest, as he always paid for his rooms, and was popular with women. He had been seen drinking with at least one other man at The King's Arms shortly before the murders, so he was subjected to an intense interrogation. Williams was of medium height and slight build, so his description in no way matched Turner's description of a large man in a dark flushing coat. He said that he had never denied being at The King's Arms that evening, but the Williamsons considered him a family friend. Mrs Williamson had even touched his face that night in a motherly gesture. What aroused suspicion was Williams' earlier mention that he had no money, although he was seen to have some after the murders. He claimed that he had pawned articles of clothing afterwards, offering the pawn tickets as proof, and that after he had left the tavern that evening he had consulted a surgeon about an old wound, as well as a woman with some knowledge of medicine. No one investigated this alibi or checked the dates on the pawn tickets.\n\nDespite his insistence that he was innocent, Williams was remanded to Coldbath Fields Prison, also known as the Clerkenwell Gaol, where another suspect was also incarcerated. The police were still not sure how many men were involved and confined three suspects in all.\n\nOn 24 December, more than two weeks after the Marr family had been murdered and five days after the killing of the Williamson family, the maul was identified as belonging to a sailor named John Petersen, who was away at sea. The information was volunteered by a Mr Vermiloe, the landlord of The Pear Tree, who was incarcerated in Newgate Prison for debt. Constables searched the premises and found Petersen's trunk, which was missing a maul. Vermiloe recalled that not only had the maul been in the chest, but that he himself had used it and was responsible for chipping it. That was a significant lead. It has been noted that the substantial reward money for information leading to the arrest of the murderers would have cleared Vermiloe's debts.\n\nBefore an open forum of witnesses that day, Turner was asked if he could identify Williams as the man he had seen standing over Mrs Williamson. He could not, but did state that he knew Williams from earlier visits to the tavern. Williams's laundress was called to see if she had washed any bloody clothing. She said that two weeks earlier she had noticed that one of his shirts was torn and that another that had blood on the collar, as if from bloody fingers. She assumed that Williams had been in a fight. She had not washed any clothing for him since before the Williamsons were murdered. Williams claimed that the torn and bloodstained shirts were the result of a brawl after a card game, but he was silenced by the magistrates and returned to prison.\n\nThe facts in evidence against Williams were that he had had an opportunity to take the maul, that he had money after the murders but not before, that he had returned to his room just after the killer had fled the second crime scene, and that he had had bloody and torn shirts. Although an attempt was made to identify the maul and ascertain whether any of Williams's shirts had bloodstains on them, the courts could not assess forensic evidence and gave great weight to eyewitnesses' statements.\n\nWilliams never went to trial. On 28 December he used his scarf to hang himself from an iron bar in his cell. No one discovered this until just before he was to be taken for another hearing before the Shadwell magistrates. An officer announced to the court that the accused was dead and that his body was cold. Williams' suicide surprised everyone who had spoken to him. Several prisoners and a warden said that he had appeared to be in good spirits only the day before, believing that he would soon be exonerated and released. This led to later speculation that Williams was murdered to prevent authorities from looking elsewhere.\n\nThe hearing continued despite the dead man's inability to defend himself. \"The Times\" reported that a secret prison correspondence had been discovered between Williams and one of the other suspects, \"which clearly connects them with the shocking transactions\". Another man who had shared the room at The Pear Tree with Williams said that he had found his own stockings muddied and hidden behind a chest, and concluded that Williams had worn his stockings out that night and got them dirty. He claimed that after he confronted Williams he immediately took them into the yard and washed them. Their landlady confirmed these statements and added that, while the stockings were quite muddy, she had also seen blood on them. She explained that she had not told anyone about this before Williams's death because she feared that he might kill her. A female witness who knew Williams well connected him with a chisel that was proved to have been taken from the same seaman's chest as the maul.\n\nThe court finally declared Williams guilty of the crimes, taking his suicide as a clear statement of his guilt. The cases against other suspects collapsed and, although Williams had not previously been connected with the murders of the Marr family, he was deemed the sole perpetrator of both.\n\nThe Home Secretary was more than happy to agree with the opinion of the bench, and decided that the best way to end the matter was to parade Williams's body through Wapping and Shadwell so that the residents could see that while he had \"cheated the hangman\", he was indeed dead and no longer a menace. The Thames River Police, the Bow Street Mounted Patrol, and local constables and watchmen were ordered to oversee the event.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Williams's body was removed from the prison at 11 a.m., with \"an immense concourse of persons\", said to total 180,000, taking part in a procession up the Ratcliffe Highway. When the cart carrying the body drew opposite the Marr family house, the procession halted for nearly a quarter of an hour. A drawing was made that shows, not the slender man described in newspaper accounts, but a stocky labourer. In his pocket was a piece of metal that he had apparently ripped from the prison wall to stab himself with, in the event that he was unsuccessful at hanging himself. \n\nSuicides could not be buried in consecrated ground. The stake was meant to keep the restless soul from wandering, while the crossroads were meant to confuse whatever evil ghost arose from the grave. In addition, the grave was deliberately made too small for the body, so that the murderer would feel uncomfortable even in death. Quicklime was added and the pit was covered over.\n\nThe procession also stopped for ten minutes in front of The King's Arms, where the coachman reportedly whipped the dead man three times across the face.\n\nIn August 1886, a gas company began to excavate a trench in the area where Williams had been buried. They accidentally unearthed a skeleton, reportedly buried upside down and with the remains of the wooden stake through its torso. \"It was six feet below the surface of the road where Cannon Street Road and Cable Street cross at St George's in the East.\" The landlord of The Crown and Dolphin, a public house at the corner of Cannon Street Road, is said to have retained the skull as a souvenir. The pub has since been renovated and the whereabouts of the skull are currently unknown.\n\nJohn Williams's arrest would have interested two other people involved: Cornelius Hart and William \"Long Billy\" Ablass.\n\n\nThe motive for the Ratcliff Highway Murders has remained a mystery, and a cause for speculation for detectives and crime buffs. Colin Wilson theorised that Williams was syphilitic and harboured a grudge against humanity. P.D. James and Critchley, however, believe that the proceedings were conducted quickly in order to close the case and appease the frightened public. An early eyewitness insisted that the two men seen on the road outside The King's Arms had spoken, and one had called out what sounded like a name, possibly \"Mahoney\" or \"Hughey\". Williams's name did not sound like that, but once he was in custody the report was ignored. While Williams had misrepresented himself on occasion and could have been using an alias, following a lead about two men walking up the street together, who were not proved to have had anything to do with the murders, ignored the facts about the open tavern window and the footprint in the mud outside. They believe that it was possible someone else had perpetrated the assaults, making Williams merely a tragic and unfortunate pawn.\n\nIn January 1812 the authorities still felt a need to prove that Williams had committed the murders. The weapon, either a razor or knife, that was used to cut the throats of the victims, and clearly linked to Williams, became the sought-after piece of evidence. A police officer stated that he had originally found a knife like that in the pocket of Williams's coat, but had not seen it since. Newspaper accounts of this testimony shifted from calling the weapon a razor, which they took from the surgeon's reports, to claiming that the wounds had been clearly made with a sharp knife. Eventually a knife was indeed found, and was said to have blood on it, but whether it had actually belonged to Williams or had been planted in his room to confirm his guilt is still unknown.\n\nThe thriving cheap newspapers, or \"penny press\", spread the news round the country, as the gruesome details of the violence leaked out over the days after the two incidents. This became one of the first national shock stories to circulate in Britain. Speculation on who killed the innocent families, and why, kept the story alive right through to the burial of the eventually accused man.\n\nThe murders are repeatedly referenced in Alan Moore's graphic novel \"From Hell\", where Sir William Gull speculates that the murders were a false flag operation of sorts committed by the Freemasons in order to spur on the creation of the modern police force and thus further the organization's authoritarian agenda.\n\nThe murders provided the backdrop for the first two episodes of the third series of British television drama \"Whitechapel\" in 2012.\n\nThey were also given a fictionalised treatment in Lloyd Shepherd's first novel, \"The English Monster\", in 2012.\n\nThe murders are central to the story in David Morrell's thriller, \"Murder as a Fine Art\", published in 2013.\n\nThe murders are referenced in Alison Goodman's novel The Dark Days Club, published 2016.\n\nThe murders and the murderer are analyzed by Thomas de Quincy in his famous essay \"On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts\" (1827)\n\nThe murders and Charles Horton are featured in Lloyd Shepherd’s historical novel, \"The English Monster\" (2012).\n\nThe murders are featured in Lona Manning’s historical novel, \"A Marriage of Attachment\" (2018).\n\nThe murders are mentioned (albeit with a supernatural element) in KJ Charles’s Magpie Lord series.\n\nThe murders are mentioned in Peter Ackroyd's \"Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem\" as a motivation of the murderer.\n\nThe murders are mentioned in Arthur Conan Doyle’s first Sherlock Holmes novel “A Study in Scarlet”.\n\nThe murders are mentioned in Fergus Hume's \"The Mystery of a Hansom Cab\".\n\nThe murders are mentioned in G K Chesterton's Father Brown stories, \"The Blue Cross\" and \"The Mirror of the Magistrate\" \n\nThe murders are mentioned in the second series ITV's crime drama Whitechapel.\n\n\n"}

His best known poem is probably \"Adelaide\", which was set to music by Beethoven.\n\nHe was born at Hohendodeleben near Magdeburg, the son of the village pastor, on 23 January 1761. After studying theology and philology at the university of Halle, he was appointed in 1781 master at the classical school Philanthropinum in Dessau. This once famous seminary was, however, then rapidly decaying in public favor, and in 1784 Matthisson was glad to accept a travelling tutorship. He lived for two years with the Swiss author Bonstetten at Nyon on Lake Geneva.\n\nIn 1794 he was appointed reader and traveling companion to Princess Louisa of Anhalt-Dessau (wife of Leopold III, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau). They visited Switzerland, Tyrol, and Italy. For a time, they were joined in their travels by Danish author and salonist Friederike Brun. After Princess Louisa's death in 1811, he entered the service of the king of Württemberg, was ennobled, created counselor of legation, appointed intendant of the court theatre and chief librarian of the royal library at Stuttgart. He resided for a time in Italy. In 1828 he retired and settled at Wörlitz near Dessau, where he died on 12 March 1831.\n\nMatthisson enjoyed for a time a great popularity on account of his \"Poems\" (; 1787; 15th ed., 1851; new ed., 1876), which Schiller extravagantly praised for their melancholy sweetness and their fine descriptions of scenery. The 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" praises his verse as melodious and written with musical language, but complains that the thought and sentiments expressed are too often artificial and insincere. The 1905 \"New International Encyclopaedia\" judges “his verse melodious and graceful, especially in rural description, but never strong.” His \"Adelaide\" was rendered famous by Beethoven's setting. Of Matthisson's elegies, \"Elegy in the Ruins of an Old Castle\" () was still popular in 1911, and is praised by the 1879 \"American Cyclopaedia\" as one of his finest lyrics. He edited selections from the lyric poets of Germany under the title of \"Lyrische Anthologie\" (20 vols., Zürich, 1803–07). His \"Reminiscences\" (; 5 vols., 1810-1816), contain interesting accounts of his travels.\n\nMatthisson's \"Writings\" () appeared in eight volumes (1825-1829), of which the first contains his poems and the other seven his \"Erinnerungen\"; a ninth volume was added in 1833 containing his biography by Heinrich Döring. His \"Literary Remains\" (), with a selection from his correspondence, was published in four volumes by F. R. Schoch in 1832.\n\n"}
{"id": "2164610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164610", "title": "The Bottle Imp", "text": "The Bottle Imp\n\nThe Bottle Imp is an 1891 short story by the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson usually found in the short story collection \"Island Nights' Entertainments\". It was first published in the \"New York Herald\" (February–March 1891) and \"Black and White\" London (March–April 1891). In it, the protagonist buys a bottle with an imp inside that grants wishes. However, the bottle is cursed; if the holder dies bearing it, his or her soul is forfeit to hell.\n\nKeawe, a poor Native Hawaiian, buys a strange unbreakable bottle from a sad, elderly gentleman who credits the bottle with his fortune. He promises that an imp residing in the bottle will also grant Keawe his every desire.\n\nOf course, there is a catch. The bottle must be sold, for cash, at a loss, i.e. for less than its owner originally paid, and cannot be thrown or given away, or else it will magically return to him. All of these rules must be explained by each seller to each purchaser. If an owner of the bottle dies without having sold it in the prescribed manner, that person's soul will burn for eternity in Hell.\n\nThe bottle was said to have been brought to Earth by the Devil and first purchased by Prester John for millions; it was owned by Napoleon and Captain James Cook and accounted for their great successes. By the time of the story the price has diminished to fifty dollars.\n\nKeawe buys the bottle and instantly tests it by wishing his money to be refunded, and by trying to sell it for more than he paid and abandoning it, to test if the story is true. When these all work as described, he realizes the bottle does indeed have unholy power. He wishes for his heart's desire: a big, fancy mansion on a landed estate, and finds his wish granted, but at a price: his beloved uncle and cousins have been killed in a boating accident, leaving Keawe sole heir to his uncle's fortune. Keawe is horrified, but uses the money to build his house. Having all he wants, and being happy, he explains the risks to a friend who buys the bottle from him.\n\nKeawe lives a happy life, but there is something missing. Walking along the beach one night, he meets a beautiful woman, Kokua. They soon fall in love and become engaged. Keawe's happiness is shattered on the night of his betrothal, when he discovers that he has contracted the then-incurable disease of leprosy. He must give up his house and wife, and live in Kalaupapa—a remote community for lepers—unless he can recover the bottle and use it to cure himself.\n\nKeawe begins this quest by attempting to track down the friend to whom he sold the bottle, but the friend has become suddenly wealthy and left Hawaii. Keawe traces the path of the bottle through many buyers and eventually finds a Haole of Beritania Street, Honolulu. The man of European ancestry has both good and bad news for Keawe: (a) he owns the bottle and is very willing to sell, but (b) he had only paid two cents for it. Therefore, if Keawe buys it, he will not be able to resell it.\n\nKeawe decides to buy the bottle anyway, for the price of one cent, and indeed cures himself. Now, however, he is understandably despondent: how can he possibly enjoy life, knowing his doom? His wife mistakes his depression for regret at their marriage, and asks for a divorce. Keawe confesses to her his secret.\n\nHis wife suggests they sail, with the bottle, to Tahiti; on that archipelago the colonists of French Polynesia use centimes, a coin worth one fifth of an American cent. This offers a potential recourse for Keawe.\n\nWhen they arrive, however, the suspicious natives will not touch the cursed bottle. Kokua determines to make a supreme sacrifice to save her husband from his fate. Since, however, she knows he would never sell the bottle to her knowingly, Kokua is forced to bribe an old sailor to buy the bottle for four centimes, with the understanding that she will secretly buy it back for three. Now Keawe is happy, but she carries the curse.\n\nKeawe discovers what his wife has done, and resolves to sacrifice himself for her in the same manner. He arranges for a brutish boatswain to buy the bottle for two centimes, promising he will buy it back for one, thus sealing his doom. However, the drunken sailor refuses to part with it, and is unafraid of the prospect of Hell. \"I reckon I'm going anyway,\" he says.\n\nKeawe returns to his wife, both of them free from the curse, and the reader is encouraged to believe that they live happily ever after.\n\nThe theme of the bottle imp can be found in the German legend \"Spiritus familiaris\" by the Brothers Grimm as well. At the time of publication in 1891, the currency system of the Kingdom of Hawaii included cent coins that circulated at par with the U.S. penny.\n\nThe novel reflects Stevenson's impressions gained during his five-month visit of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1889. Part of the storyline takes place in the little town Hoʻokena at the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii, which the author visited. In a scene which takes place in Honolulu Stevenson mentions Heinrich Berger, the bandmaster of the Royal Hawaiian Band. The name of Keawe's wife refers to the Hawaiian word \"kōkua\", which means \"help\". In 1889 Stevenson also visited the leper colony on the island of Molokaʻi and met Father Damien there. Therefore, he had a first-hand experience from the fate of lepers. Several times Stevenson uses the Hawaiian word \"Haole\", which is the usual term for Caucasians, for example describing the last owner of the bottle.\n\nThe story could be considered as both a continuation of and a rather light-hearted counterpoint to the theme of selling one's soul to The Devil, manifested in the numerous depictions of Doctor Faust as well as in such stories as \"The Devil and Tom Walker\" by Washington Irving and \"The Devil and Daniel Webster\" by Stephen Vincent Benet.\n\n\"The Bottle Imp\" was published in the missionary magazine \"O le sulu Samoa\" (The Samoan Torch) in 1891, with the title \"O Le Tala I Le Fagu Aitu\". According to \"Publishers Weekly\" and \"School Library Journal\" (both quoted by Amazon.com) \"this tale was originally published, in Samoan, in 1891\". \"The Locus Online Index to Science Fiction\" similarly states \"The Stevenson story was first published in Samoan in 1891, appearing later that year in English.\" The Project Gutenberg text of the story has a note by Stevenson which says \"...the tale has been designed and written for a Polynesian audience...\" which also suggests initial publication in Polynesia, not in the United States.\n\nThe premise of the story creates a logical paradox similar to the unexpected hanging paradox. Clearly no rational person would buy it for one cent as this would make it impossible for it to be sold at a loss. However, it follows that no rational person would buy it for two cents either if it is later to be sold only to a rational person for a loss. By backward induction, the bottle cannot be sold for \"any\" price in a perfectly rational world. And yet, the actions of the people in the story do not seem particularly unwise.\n\nThe story shows that the paradox could be resolved by the existence of certain characters:\n\nSince the exchange rates of different currencies can fluctuate with respect to one another, it is also possible that the \"value\" of the bottle could increase from one transaction to the next even if the stated price decreases. This leads to an endless staircase-type paradox which would make it possible, in theory, for the bottle to keep getting sold infinitely many times.

It is commonly dated from the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and contrasted with a later Early Modern Period; the time during which the rise of humanism in the Italian Renaissance and the Reformation unfolded, are generally associated with the transition out of the Middle Ages, with European overseas expansion as a succeeding process, but such dates are approximate and based upon nuanced arguments.\n\nThe first waves of Slavic migration settled the area of the upper Vistula River and elsewhere in the lands of present-day southeastern Poland and southern Masovia, coming from the upper and middle regions of the Dnieper River. Results of a genetic study by researchers from Gdańsk Medical University \"support hypothesis placing the earliest known homeland of Slavs in the middle Dnieper basin\". The West Slavs came primarily from the more western early Slavic branch called the Sclaveni by the Byzantine historian Jordanes in \"Getica\", the eastern branch being the Antes. The Slavs had first migrated into Poland in the second half of the 5th century, some half century after these territories had been vacated by Germanic tribes (after a period during which settlements were absent or rare). According to the references given in this and Poland in the Early Middle Ages article, many scholars now believe that the Slavic tribes had not been present in Poland before the earliest medieval period, though the opposite view, predominant in Polish prehistory and protohistory in the past, is still represented.\n\nFrom there, over the 6th century, the new population dispersed north and west. The Slavs lived mostly by cultivating crops but also engaged in hunting and gathering. Their migrations took place while Eastern and Central Europe were being invaded from the east by waves of peoples and armies such as the Huns, Avars and Magyars.\nA number of West Slavic Polish tribes formed small states, beginning in the 8th century, some of which later coalesced into larger states. Among these tribes were the Vistulans (\"Wiślanie\") in southern Poland, with Kraków and Wiślica as their main centers (major fortified centers were built in their country in the 9th century), but later the tribe(s) referred to as the Polans (\"Polanie\"—literally, \"people of the fields\") would prove of decisive historic importance. At the end of the 9th century Vistulans were part of the Great Moravia, according to some theories.\n\nThe tribal states built many gords – fortified structures with earthen and wooden walls and embankments – from the 7th century onward. Some of these were developed and inhabited; others featured a large empty space and may have served primarily as refuges in times of trouble. The Polans settled the plains around Giecz, Poznań and Gniezno that would become the early center of Poland and lent their name to the country. They went through a period of accelerated building of gord-type fortified settlements and of territorial expansion, beginning in the first half of the 10th century, and the Polish state developed from their tribal polities in the second half of the 10th century.\n\nThe Polish state begins with the rule of Mieszko I of the Piast dynasty in the second half of the 10th century. Mieszko chose to be baptized in the Western Latin Rite in 966. Following its emergence, the Polish nation was led by a series of rulers who converted the population to Christianity, created a strong kingdom and integrated Poland into the European culture. Mieszko's son Bolesław I Chrobry established a Polish Church province, pursued territorial conquests and was officially crowned, becoming the first King of Poland. This was followed by a collapse of the monarchy and restoration under Casimir I. Casimir's son Bolesław II the Bold became fatally involved in a conflict with the ecclesiastical authority, and was expelled from the country. After Bolesław III divided the country among his sons, internal fragmentation eroded the initial Piast monarchy structure in the 12th and 13th centuries. One of the regional Piast dukes invited the Teutonic Knights to help him fight the Baltic Prussian pagans, which caused centuries of Poland's warfare with the Knights and then with the German Prussian state. The Kingdom was restored under Władysław I the Elbow-high, strengthened and expanded by his son Casimir III the Great. The western provinces of Silesia and Pomerania were lost after the fragmentation, and Poland began expanding to the east. The consolidation in the 14th century laid the base for, after the reigns of two members of the Angevin dynasty, the new powerful Kingdom of Poland that was to follow.\n\nBeginning with the Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila (Władysław II Jagiełło), the Jagiellon dynasty (1385–1569) formed the Polish–Lithuanian union. The partnership brought vast Lithuania-controlled Rus' areas into Poland's sphere of influence and proved beneficial for the Poles and Lithuanians, who coexisted and cooperated in one of the largest political entities in Europe for the next four centuries. In the Baltic Sea region Poland's struggle with the Teutonic Knights continued and included the milestone Peace of Thorn under King Casimir IV Jagiellon; the treaty created the future Duchy of Prussia. In the south Poland confronted the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Tatars, and in the east helped Lithuania fight the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Poland was developing as a feudal state, with predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly dominant landed nobility component. The \"Nihil novi\" act adopted by the Polish Sejm (parliament) in 1505, transferred most of the legislative power from the monarch to the Sejm. This event marked the beginning of the period known as \"Golden Liberty\", when the state was ruled by the \"free and equal\" Polish nobility. Protestant Reformation movements made deep inroads into the Polish Christianity, which resulted in unique at that time in Europe policies of religious tolerance. The European Renaissance currents evoked in late Jagiellon Poland (kings Sigismund I the Old and Sigismund II Augustus) an immense cultural flowering. Poland's and Lithuania's territorial expansion included the far north region of Livonia.\n\n\n\"a.\"\"Though their names are now dispersed amid various clans and places, yet they are chiefly called Sclaveni and Antes\"; transl. by Charles Christopher Mierow, Princeton University Press 1908, from the University of Calgary web site\n\n\"b.\"This is the so-called allochthonic theory; according to the autochthonic theory the opposite is true\n"}

He was one of the founders of Sinn Féin and was the party's president from 1908 to 1911.\n\nHe was the eldest son of John Sweetman (a Dublin brewer) and Honoria, daughter of Malachy O'Connor (a Dublin merchant). He was born in County Dublin and educated at Downside School in Somerset. He lived at Drumbaragh, Kells, County Meath. He married Agnes Hanly in Navan, County Meath on 11 September 1895. They had six children.\n\nIn 1879 he was prominent enough in Irish nationalist circles to be a committee member and propose the election of Charles Stewart Parnell as president of the Irish Land League.\n\nIn 1880 he visited Minnesota and became involved with Bishop Ireland's scheme to settle poor Irish people in the State, recently vacated by the Eastern Dakota. On 27 December 1881 \"The Times\" published an article from 'a correspondent' (who may have been Sweetman himself) about 'An Irish Colony. Currie, Murray County, Minnesota'. The article explained that John Sweetman was the Managing Director of the Irish-American Colonization Company, \"the principal organizer and practical director of the emigration...in order to make the most profitable selection of lands Mr Sweetman travelled through and carefully examined the States of Dakota and Minnesota, and also Manitoba, and finally purchased some 20,000 acres (80 km²) of prairie land situated in Murray County ...\".\n\nUnfortunately the colonisation project was not a complete success, but it did help a number of people to obtain a better life in America.\n\nThe Sweetman brewery in Dublin was purchased by Casey's Drogheda Brewery Ltd in 1890.\n\nHe was a major investor in the \"National Press\" newspaper. \"The Times\" of 3 June 1892 mentioned that \"Mr John Sweetman of County Meath, who had contributed £1,000 as a donation to the fund for starting the \"National Press\", had been unanimously selected for the Eastern Division\". This was at a convention to select Nationalist candidates for the two Parliamentary constituencies in County Wicklow.\n\nHe was elected at the 1892 general election as MP for East Wicklow as a member of the Anti-Parnellite faction of the Irish Parliamentary Party. He became a Parnellite in 1895 and resigned the seat on 8 April 1895. At the resulting by-election 26 April 1895, he stood as a Parnellite candidate but was defeated in a closely fought three-way contest. At the general election in July 1895 he stood in North Meath, where he narrowly failed to unseat the sitting anti-Parnellite MP James Gibney.\n\nBy the early twentieth century he had become more radical. In 1905, speaking at the annual conference of the Catholic Truth Society of Ireland in response to a paper suggesting the replanting of the waste lands of Ireland as a remedy to emigration, he displayed considerable hostility to the \"English\" government. \"The Times\" reported that he said \"it was not for that society to call upon its greatest enemy, the English government, to plant forests. The English government hated the Irish nation as that of Egypt hated the Jewish nation, and they must fight the Government with all the weapons that God had given them, just as Moses had fought the Egyptians. Unfortunately they had not the power to call down the ten plagues of Egypt upon the English Government, but they could boycott England's manufactures and her Navy and Army\".\n\nHe was one of the founders of Sinn Féin in 1905. He became the party's second president in 1908, succeeding Edward Martyn, and retained the presidency until 1911 when he stepped down, to be succeeded by Arthur Griffith.\n\nHe was briefly arrested and detained after the 1916 Easter Rising. He turned down a Sinn Féin nomination for the 1918 general election on the grounds that he was too old; his cousin Roger Sweetman was Teachta Dála (TD) for North Wexford from 1918 to 1921.\n\nSweetman supported the Pro-Treaty faction in the Civil War period but later denounced the government of W. T. Cosgrave for its abandonment of Griffith's protectionist economic policies, and supported Fianna Fáil after 1927. Throughout his life he wrote many letters to Irish newspapers, and in the late 1920s and early 1930s he was a contributor to \"The Leader\" edited by D. P. Moran.\n\nSweetman was fiercely opposed to the Blueshirts (of which his other cousin Gerard Sweetman was an enthusiastic member), comparing Eoin O'Duffy to Hitler. He also opposed plans to build a Catholic Cathedral in Merrion Square, where he himself lived, on the grounds that this would cause great trouble and inconvenience to the residents.\n\nHe died in Dublin in 1936 aged 92.\n\n"}

Before becoming Akwid both \"AK\" and \"Wikid\" were part of a former rap group named the \"Head Knockerz\" with other group members Sabu and John John\n\nSergio and Francisco Gómez were born in Jiquilpan, Michoacán, Mexico. Relocated to the United States of America at the ages of five and three years. They are not twins, Sergio is older. They grew up a mile West from Down Town LA in an area now known as Westlake South. Sergio Gomez and his siblings attended 10th St Elementary and Berendo Junior High. Educated later on the streets of South Central Los Angeles, they discovered a musical talent and a great concern among the worlds of Hip Hop. They were recognized and aggressively pressed the fusion of music and culture. Akwid gave life and the identity of people who today represents youth between communities worldwide. Appointed pioneers of the genre, humbly Gómez brothers are in the world of creation and expression through music. Conquering one to see with a unique style to others.\n\nTheir Second album, \"Proyecto Akwid\", won two \"Billboard\" Prizes and a Latin Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album.\n\nTheir 2004 album \"Hoy, Ayer, and Forever\" remixes several songs from the album \"2002 A.D.\" using their more recent style, incorporating regional Mexican music. Their 2004 album \"KOMP 104.9 Radio Compa\" is in the form of a broadcast on a fictitious radio station that plays only Akwid, and their 2005 album \"Los Aguacates De Jiquilpan\" is in the form of a fairy tale explaining their arrival from Mexico to the U.S..\nThey are currently signed to Universal's Machete Music.\n\nTheir song, \"¡Chivas Explosivas!\" is the official anthem for Club Deportivo Chivas USA of Major League Soccer.\n\nAkwid's music, such as their song \"No Hay Manera,\" has had heavy cultural and musical impact, and was part of a Mexicanization of Los Angeles into \"Nuevo L.A.\" \"No Hay Manera\" first became popular in 2003, and was played on both U.S. urban and Mexican regional radios, which, at the time, was a breakthrough for Mexican-American hip-hop. Furthermore, \"No Hay Manera\" began the slow addition of hip-hop into Mexican music. The song features rapping, in Spanish, over a distinctly Mexican style of band music. Ethnomusicologist Josh Kun separates \"No Hay Manera\" into three different musical layers: the hip-hop style lyrics, the use of a banda orquesta sample, and the use of \"Te Lo Pido Por Favor.\" Each of these layers has its own influences, and all together, create a hybrid of Mexican and American styles. The lyrics of the song draw heavily from an African-American hip-hop style, and also from the popular Chicano style of rapping. The banda orquesta, on the other hand, is a Mexican band that mixes the structure and sound of American big bands with Mexican orchestras, and quickly became the symbolic music of Mexicans living in the U.S. in the 1990s. Lastly, \"Te Lo Pido Por Favor,\" sung by Juan Gabriel, was regarded as a national symbol of Mexican music. Its use indicated a meshing of Mexican and American identity. These layers are important, because Los Angeles was the center of Mexican and African American or American music. Akwid's music is a representation of the strong Mexican identity within Mexican-Americans living in the United States. Unlike many other immigrants, Mexicans retain a deep connection with Mexico, and frequently visit the country or send money back home. Kun calls this a cross-border continuum, in that Mexican immigration to the United States is circular rather than one-way. Mexican immigrants themselves were also very reluctant to give up their culture and assimilate into the United States. In \"No Hay Manera,\" Akwid raps about refusing to assimilate, and reconnecting with their Mexican roots. Overall, Akwid's music is representative of the cultural hybridity occurring in Los Angeles in the late 20th century. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2164726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164726", "title": "Hilbert's twelfth problem", "text": "Hilbert's twelfth problem\n\nKronecker's Jugendtraum or Hilbert's twelfth problem, of the 23 mathematical Hilbert problems, is the extension of the Kronecker–Weber theorem on abelian extensions of the rational numbers, to any base number field. That is, it asks for analogues of the roots of unity, as complex numbers that are particular values of the exponential function; the requirement is that such numbers should generate a whole family of further number fields that are analogues of the cyclotomic fields and their subfields.\n\nThe classical theory of complex multiplication, now often known as the \"Kronecker Jugendtraum\", does this for the case of any imaginary quadratic field, by using modular functions and elliptic functions chosen with a particular period lattice related to the field in question. Goro Shimura extended this to CM fields. The general case is still open . Leopold Kronecker described the complex multiplication issue as his \"\" or “dearest dream of his youth”.\n\nThe fundamental problem of algebraic number theory is to describe the fields of algebraic numbers. The work of Galois made it clear that field extensions are controlled by certain groups, the Galois groups. The simplest situation, which is already at the boundary of what is well-understood, is when the group in question is abelian. All quadratic extensions, obtained by adjoining the roots of a quadratic polynomial, are abelian, and their study was commenced by Gauss. Another type of abelian extension of the field Q of rational numbers is given by adjoining the \"n\"th roots of unity, resulting in the cyclotomic fields. Already Gauss had shown that, in fact, every quadratic field is contained in a larger cyclotomic field. The Kronecker–Weber theorem shows that any finite abelian extension of Q is contained in a cyclotomic field. Kronecker's (and Hilbert's) question addresses the situation of a more general algebraic number field K: what are the algebraic numbers necessary to construct all abelian extensions of K? The complete answer to this question has been completely worked out only when K is an imaginary quadratic field or its generalization, a CM-field.\n\nHilbert's original statement of his 12th problem is rather misleading: he seems to imply that the abelian extensions of imaginary quadratic fields are generated by special values of elliptic modular functions, which is not correct. (It is hard to tell exactly what Hilbert was saying, one problem being that he may have been using the term \"elliptic function\" to mean both the elliptic function ℘ and the elliptic modular function \"j\".)\nFirst it is also necessary to use roots of unity, though Hilbert may have implicitly meant to include these. More seriously, while values of elliptic modular functions generate the Hilbert class field, for more general abelian extensions one also needs to use values of elliptic functions. For example, the abelian extension formula_1 is not generated by singular moduli and roots of unity.\n\nOne particularly appealing way to state the Kronecker–Weber theorem is by saying that the maximal abelian extension of Q can be obtained by adjoining the special values exp(2π\"i\"/\"n\") of the exponential function. Similarly, the theory of complex multiplication shows that the maximal abelian extension of Q(τ), where τ is an imaginary quadratic irrationality, can be obtained by adjoining the special values of ℘(τ,\"z\") and \"j\"(τ) of modular functions \"j\" and elliptic functions ℘, and roots of unity, where τ is in the imaginary quadratic field and \"z\" represents a torsion point on the corresponding elliptic curve. One interpretation of Hilbert's twelfth problem asks to provide a suitable analogue of exponential, elliptic, or modular functions, whose special values would generate the maximal abelian extension K of a general number field K. In this form, it remains unsolved. A description of the field K was obtained in the class field theory, developed by Hilbert\nhimself, Emil Artin, and others in the first half of the 20th century. However the construction of K in class field theory involves first constructing larger non-abelian extensions using Kummer theory, and then cutting down to the abelian extensions, so does not really solve Hilbert's problem which asks for a more direct construction of the abelian extensions.\n\nDevelopments since around 1960 have certainly contributed. Before that in his dissertation used Hilbert modular forms to study abelian extensions of real quadratic fields. Complex multiplication of abelian varieties was an area opened up by the work of Shimura and Taniyama. This gives rise to abelian extensions of CM-fields in general. The question of which extensions can be found is that of the Tate modules of such varieties, as Galois representations. Since this is the most accessible case of l-adic cohomology, these representations have been studied in depth.\n\nRobert Langlands argued in 1973 that the modern version of the \"\" should deal with Hasse–Weil zeta functions of Shimura varieties. While he envisaged a grandiose program that would take the subject much further, more than thirty years later serious doubts remain concerning its import for the question that Hilbert asked.\n\nA separate development was Stark's conjecture (Harold Stark), which in contrast dealt directly with the question of finding interesting, particular units in number fields. This has seen a large conjectural development for L-functions, and is also capable of producing concrete, numerical results.\n\n"}

{"id": "2164754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164754", "title": "Steven Stayner", "text": "Steven Stayner\n\nSteven Gregory Stayner (April 18, 1965 – September 16, 1989) was an American kidnapping victim. On December 4, 1972, Stayner, age 7, was abducted in Merced, California by child molester Kenneth Parnell. He was held by his abductor 200 miles away in Mendocino County, California until he was 14, returning to his family after he was discovered while returning another of Parnell's victims, Timothy White, to his own family.\n\nStayner died in 1989 in a motorcycle accident while riding home from work.\n\nStayner was the third of five children born to Delbert and Kay Stayner in Merced, California. He had three sisters and an older brother, Cary. In 2002, Cary was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1999 murders of four women.\n\nOn the afternoon of December 4, 1972, Stayner was approached on his way home from school by a man named Ervin Edward Murphy, who had become acquainted with convicted child rapist Kenneth Parnell as they both worked at a resort in Yosemite National Park. Murphy, described by those who knew him as a trusting, naïve, and simple-minded man, had been enlisted by Parnell (who had passed himself off to Murphy as an aspiring minister) into helping him abduct a young boy so that Parnell could \"raise him in a religious-type deal,\" as Murphy later stated.\n\nActing on instructions from Parnell, Murphy passed out gospel tracts to boys walking home from school that day and, after spotting Stayner, claimed to be a church representative seeking donations. Stayner later claimed that Murphy asked him if his mother would be willing to donate any items to the church. When the boy replied that she would, Murphy then asked Stayner where he lived and if he would be willing to take Murphy to his home.\n\nAfter Stayner agreed, a white Buick driven by Parnell pulled up, and Stayner willingly climbed into the car with Murphy. Parnell then drove a confused Stayner to his cabin in nearby Catheys Valley instead. Unbeknownst to Stayner, Parnell's cabin was located only several hundred feet from his maternal grandfather's residence.\n\nParnell molested Stayner the first night at the cabin. Parnell began raping Stayner thirteen days later, on December 17, 1972. After telling Parnell that he wanted to go home many times during that first week, Parnell told Stayner that he had been granted legal custody of the boy because his parents could not afford so many children and that they did not want him anymore.\n\nParnell began calling the boy Dennis Gregory Parnell, retaining Stayner's real middle name and his real birth date when enrolling him in various schools over the next several years. Parnell passed himself off as Stayner's father, and the two moved frequently around California, living in locations including Santa Rosa and Comptche. Parnell allowed Stayner to begin drinking at a young age and to come and go virtually as he pleased. Parnell had also bounced from one menial job to another, some of his work requiring travel and leaving Stayner unguarded, causing an adult Stayner to remark he could have easily used these absences as opportunities to flee, but was unaware how to summon help. \n\nOne of the few positive aspects of Stayner's life with Parnell was the dog he had received as a gift from him, a Manchester Terrier that he named Queenie. This dog had been given to Parnell by his mother, who was not aware of Stayner's existence during the period when he was living with Parnell.\n\nFor a period of eighteen months, a woman named Barbara Mathias lived with Parnell and Stayner. According to Stayner, Mathias, along with Parnell, raped him on nine separate occasions at the age of nine. In 1975, on Parnell's instruction, Mathias tried to lure another young boy, who was in the Santa Rosa Boys' Club with Stayner, into Parnell's car. The attempt was unsuccessful. Mathias later claimed to have been completely unaware that \"Dennis\" had, in fact, been kidnapped.\n\nAs Stayner entered puberty, Parnell began to look for a younger child to kidnap. Parnell had used Stayner to attempt to kidnap children on prior occasions. However, all the kidnapping attempts were unsuccessful. This caused Parnell to believe Stayner lacked the means to be an accomplice; Stayner later revealed he intentionally sabotaged these failed kidnappings. On February 14, 1980, Parnell and a teenage friend of Stayner's named Randall Sean Poorman kidnapped five-year-old Timothy White in Ukiah. Motivated in part by the young boy's distress, Stayner decided to return the boy to his parents.\n\nOn March 1, 1980, while Parnell was away at his night security job, Stayner left with White and hitchhiked into Ukiah. Unable to locate White's home address, he decided to have White walk into the police station to ask for help, without him. Police officers spotted and detained both of them. Stayner immediately identified White and then revealed his own true identity and story.\nBy daybreak on March 2, 1980, Parnell had been arrested on suspicion of abducting both boys. When the police checked into his background they found a previous sodomy conviction from 1951. Both children were reunited with their families that day. In 1981, Parnell was tried and convicted of kidnapping White and Stayner in two separate trials. He was sentenced to seven years but was paroled after serving five. \n\nParnell was not charged with the numerous sexual assaults on Stayner and other boys because most of them occurred outside the jurisdiction of the Merced County prosecutor or were by then outside the statute of limitations. The Mendocino County prosecutors, acting almost entirely alone, decided not to prosecute Parnell for the sexual assaults that occurred in their jurisdiction, likely due to a belief that they were protecting Stayner because rape and molestation victims were seen as \"damaged goods.\" They may also have felt that they were respecting the Stayner parents' reluctance to discuss Parnell's crimes because of the repulsive nature of male sexual abuse.\n\nMurphy and Poorman, who had helped abduct White, were convicted of lesser charges. Both claimed they knew nothing of the sexual assaults on Stayner. Mathias was never arrested. Stayner remembered the kindness \"Uncle\" Murphy had shown him in his first week of captivity while they were both under the influence of Parnell's manipulation, and he believed that Murphy was as much Parnell's victim as he and Timmy were. Stayner's kidnapping and its aftermath prompted California lawmakers to change state laws \"to allow consecutive prison terms in similar abduction cases.\"\n\nAfter returning to his family, Stayner had trouble adjusting to a more structured household as he had been allowed to smoke, drink and do as he pleased when he lived with Parnell. In an interview with \"Newsweek\" shortly after his escape, Stayner said, \"I returned almost a grown man and yet my parents saw me at first as their 7-year-old. After they stopped trying to teach me the fundamentals all over again, it got better. But why doesn't my dad hug me anymore? [...] Everything has changed. Sometimes I blame myself. I don't know sometimes if I should have come home. Would I have been better off if I didn't?\" \n\nStayner underwent brief counseling but never sought additional treatment. He also refused to disclose all the details of sexual abuse he endured from Parnell. In a 2007 interview, Stayner's sister Cory said that her brother did not seek counseling because their father said Stayner \"didn't need any\". She added, \"He [Steven] got on with his life but he was pretty messed up.\" He was bullied by other children at school for being molested and eventually dropped out. Stayner began to drink frequently, and was eventually kicked out of the family home. His relationship with his father remained strained.\n\nIn 1985, Stayner married 17-year-old Jody Edmondson, with whom he had two children. He also worked with child abduction groups, spoke to children about personal safety, and gave interviews about his kidnapping. He joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints just before his death. At the time of his death, Stayner was living in Merced and working at a pizza shop.\n\nOn September 16, 1989, Stayner sustained fatal head injuries while on his way home from work when his motorcycle collided with a car.\nFive hundred people attended his funeral, at which 14-year-old Timmy White was a pallbearer.\n\nIn early 1989, a television miniseries based on his experience, \"I Know My First Name is Steven\" (also known as \"The Missing Years\"), was produced. Steven, taking a leave of absence from his job, acted as an advisor for Lorimar-Telepictures and had a non-speaking part, playing one of the two policemen who escort 14-year-old Steven (played by Corin Nemec) through the crowds to his waiting family, on his return to his Merced home. Although pleased with the dramatization, Stayner did complain that it depicted him as a somewhat \"obnoxious, rude\" person, especially toward his parents, something he refuted while publicizing the miniseries in the spring of 1989. The two-part miniseries was first broadcast by NBC on May 21–22, 1989. Screening rights were sold to a number of international television companies including the BBC, which screened the miniseries in mid-July of the following year; later still, it was released as a feature-length movie.\n\nThe production was based on a manuscript by Mike Echols, who had researched the story and interviewed Stayner and Parnell, among others. After the premiere of \"I Know My First Name is Steven\", which received four Emmy Award nominations, including one for Nemec. Echols published his book, \"I Know My First Name is Steven\", in 1991. In the epilogue to his book, Echols describes how he infiltrated NAMBLA. In 1999, against the wishes of the Stayner family, Echols wrote an additional chapter, about Steven's older brother Cary at the request of his publisher, which then re-published the book.\n\nThe title of the film and book are taken from the first paragraph of Steven's written police statement, given during the early hours of March 2, 1980 in Ukiah. It reads (note the incorrect spelling of his family name);\n\"My name is Steven Stainer \"[sic]\". I am fourteen years of age. I don't know my true birthdate, but I use April 18, 1965. I know my first name is Steven, I'm pretty sure my last is Stainer \"[sic]\", and if I have a middle name, I don't know it.\"\n\nSteven's story was also included in the book \"Against Their Will\" by Nigel Cawthorne, a compilation of stories of kidnappings.\n\nTen years after Stayner's death, the city of Merced asked its residents to propose names for city parks honoring Merced's notable citizens. Stayner's parents proposed that one be named \"Stayner Park\". This idea was eventually rejected and the honor was instead given to another Merced resident, because Stayner's brother Cary confessed to, and was charged with, killing four women in Yosemite in 1999; Merced city officials feared that the name \"Stayner Park\" would be associated with Cary rather than Steven.\n\nIn 2004, Parnell, then 72 years old, was convicted of trying the previous year to persuade his nurse to procure for him a young boy for five hundred dollars. The nurse, aware of Parnell's past, reported this to local police. Timmy White, then a grown man, was subpoenaed to testify in Parnell's criminal trial. Although Stayner was dead, his testimony at Parnell's earlier trial was read to jurors as evidence in Parnell's 2004 trial. Parnell died of natural causes on January 21, 2008, at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville, California, while serving a sentence of 25 years to life.\n\nWhite later became a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Deputy. He died on April 1, 2010, at age 35 from pulmonary embolism. White was survived by his wife, Dena, and two young children, as well as by his mother, father, stepfather and sister. Nearly five months later, on August 28, 2010, a statue of Stayner and White was dedicated in Applegate Park in Merced. Residents of Ukiah, White's hometown, carved a statue showing a teenage Stayner with young White in hand while escaping their captivity. Fundraisers for the statue have stated that it is meant to honor Steven Stayner and give families of missing and kidnapped children hope that they are still alive.\n\nSteven's father, Delbert Stayner, died on April 9, 2013 at his home in Winton, California. He was 79 years old.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2164771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164771", "title": "History of Ohio", "text": "History of Ohio\n\nThe history of Ohio as a state began when the Northwest Territory was divided in 1800 and the remainder reorganized for admission to the union in March, 1803 as the 17th state of the United States. The recorded history of Ohio began in the late 17th century when French explorers from Canada reached the Ohio River, from which the \"Ohio Country\" took its name, a river the Iroquois called \"O-y-o\", \"great river\". Before that, Native Americans speaking Algonquin languages had inhabited Ohio and the central midwestern United States for hundreds of years until displaced by the Iroquois in the latter part of the 17th century. Other cultures not generally identified as \"Indians\", including the Hopewell \"mound builders\", preceded them. Human history in Ohio began a few millennia after formation of the Bering land bridge about 14,500BCE - see Prehistory of Ohio.\n\nBy the mid-18th century, a few American and French fur traders engaged historic Native American tribes in present-day Ohio in the fur trade. The Native Americans had their own extensive trading networks across the continent before the Europeans arrived. American settlement in the Ohio Country came after the American Revolutionary War and the formation of the United States, with its takeover of former British territory. Congress prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory which presaged Ohio and the five states of the Territory entering the Union as \"free\" states. Ohio's population increased rapidly after United States victory in the Northwest Indian Wars brought peace to the Ohio frontier. In 1803, Ohio was admitted to the union as the 17th state. Settlement was chiefly by migrants from New England, New York and Pennsylvania. Southerners settled along the southern part of the territory, arriving by travel along the Ohio River from the Upper South. Yankees, especially in the \"Western reserve\" (near Cleveland), supported modernization, public education, and anti-slavery policies. The state supported the Union in the American Civil War, although antiwar Copperhead sentiment was strong in southern settlements.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Ohio developed as a major industrial state. Ships traveled the Great Lakes to deliver iron ore and other products from western areas. This was also a route for exports, as were the railroads. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the fast-growing industries created jobs that employed hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Europe. In World War I Europe was closed off to passenger traffic. A new wave of migrants came from the South, with rural whites from Appalachia, and African Americans in the Great Migration from the Deep South, to escape Jim Crow and violence.\n\nThe cultures of Ohio's major cities became much more diverse with the traditions, cultures, foods, and music of the new arrivals. Ohio's industries were integral to American industrial power in the 20th century. In the later 20th century, economic restructuring in steel, railroads, and other heavy manufacturing cost the state many jobs as heavy industry declined. The economy in the 21st century has gradually shifted to depend on service industries such as medicine and education.\n\nA fossil which dated between 11,727 and 11,424 B.C. indicated that Paleo-Indians hunted large animals, including Jefferson's ground sloth, using stone tools. Later ancestors of Native Americans were known as the Archaic peoples. Sophisticated successive cultures such as the Adena, Hopewell and Fort Ancient, built monumental earthworks such as massive monuments, some of which have survived to the present.\n\nThe Late Archaic period featured the development of focal subsistence economies and regionalization of cultures. Regional cultures in Ohio include the Maple Creek Culture of southwestern Ohio, the Glacial Kame Culture of western Ohio (especially northwestern Ohio), and the Red Ochre and Old Copper cultures across much of northern Ohio. Flint Ridge, located in present-day Licking County, provided flint, an extremely important raw material and trade good. Objects made from Flint Ridge flint have been found as far east as the Atlantic coast, as far west as Kansas City, and as far south as Louisiana, demonstrating the wide network of prehistoric trading cultures.\n\nAbout 800 BC, Late Archaic cultures were supplanted by the Adena culture. The Adenas were mound builders. Many of their thousands of mounds in Ohio have survived. Following the Adena culture was the Hopewell culture (c. 100 to c. 400 C.E.), which also built sophisticated mounds and earthworks, some of which survive at Hopewell and Newark Earthworks. They used their constructions as astronomical observatories and places of ritual celebration. The Fort Ancient culture also built mounds, including some effigy mounds. Researchers first considered the Serpent Mound in Adams County, Ohio to be an Adena mound. It is the largest effigy mound in the United States and one of Ohio's best-known landmarks. Scholars believe it may have been a more recent work of Fort Ancient people. In Southern Ohio alone, archaeologists have pinpointed 10000 mounds used as burial sites and have excavated another 1000 earth-walled enclosures, including one enormous fortification with a circumference of about 3.5 miles, enclosing about 100 acres. We now know from a great variety of items found in the mound tombs - large ceremonial blades chipped from obsidian rock formations in Yellowstone National Park; embossed breast-plates, ornaments and weapons fashioned from copper nuggets from the Great Lakes region; decorative objects cut from sheets of mica from the southern Appalachians; conch shells from the Atlantic seaboard; and ornaments made from shark and alligator teeth and shells from the Gulf of Mexico - that the Mound Builders participated in a vast trading network that linked together hundreds of Native Americans across the continent.\n\nWhen modern Europeans began to arrive in North America, they traded with numerous Native American (also known as American Indian) tribes for furs in exchange for goods. When the Iroquois Confederacy depleted the beaver and other game in its territory in the New York region, they launched a war known as the Beaver Wars, destroying or scattering the contemporary inhabitants of the Tennessee region. During the Beaver Wars in the 1650s, the Iroquois nearly destroyed the Erie along the shore of Lake Erie. Thereafter, the Iroquois claimed Ohio and West Virginia lands as hunting grounds. For several decades, the land was nearly uninhabited.\n\nThe land east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes had been fought over for centuries before the United States government was formed.\n\nIn 1608, French explorer and founder of Quebec City Samuel Champlain sided with the Wabanaki Confederacy and their allies the \"Huron\" people living along the St. Lawrence River against the Iroquois Confederacy (\"Five Nations\") living in what is now upper and western New York state. The result was a lasting enmity by the Iroquois Confederacy towards the French, which caused them to side with the Dutch fur traders coming up the Hudson River in about 1626. The Dutch offered better prices than the French and traded firearms, hatchets and knives to the Iroquois in exchange for furs.\n\nWith these more sophisticated weapons, the Five Nations nearly exterminated the Huron and all of the other Native Americans living immediately to their west in the Ohio country during the Beaver Wars, beginning in the 1640s. The Native American tribes were competing for hunting grounds for the fur trade. The western tribes had also been weakened by epidemics of European infectious diseases, against which they had no acquired immunity. The Five Nations's use of modern weapons caused the wars to become deadlier. Historians consider the Beaver Wars to have been one of the bloodiest conflicts in the history of North America.\n\nAbout 1664, the Five Nations became trading partners with the British, who conquered the New Netherlands (renamed New York) from the Dutch.\n\nThe Five Nations enlarged their territory by right of conquest. The number of tribes paying tribute to them realigned the tribal map of eastern North America. Several large confederacies were destroyed or relocated, including the Huron, Neutral, Erie, Susquehannock and Shawnee. The Five Nations pushed several other eastern tribes to and even across the Mississippi River. The Ohio country was virtually emptied, as the defeated tribes fled west to escape the Five Nations warriors. After the Five Nations' warriors were defeated, they left much of the Northwest territory, Kentucky and Ohio almost unpopulated and with abandoned villages. They had claimed the entire Ohio Valley as their own country.\n\nAfter about 1700, some remnants of the Native American tribes began returning to the Northwest Territory. They were often conglomerations of several tribes who paid tribute to the Five Nations (see also Mingo).\n\nIn the 17th century, the French were the first modern Europeans to explore what became known as Ohio Country. In 1663, it became part of New France, a royal province of French Empire, and northeastern Ohio was further explored by Robert La Salle in 1669.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the French set up a system of trading posts to control the fur trade in the region, linked to their settlements in present-day Canada and what they called the Illinois Country along the Mississippi River. Fort Miami on the site of present-day St. Joseph, Michigan was constructed in 1680 by New France Governor-General Louis de Buade de Frontenac.\nThey built Fort Sandoské by 1750 (and perhaps a fortified trading post at Junundat in 1754).\n\nBy the 1730s, population pressure from expanding European colonies on the Atlantic coast compelled several groups of Native Americans to relocate to the Ohio Country. From the east, the Delaware and Shawnee arrived, and Wyandot and Ottawa from the north. The Miami lived in what is now western Ohio. The Mingo formed out of Iroquois who migrated west into the Ohio lands, as well as some refugee remnants of other tribes.\n\nChristopher Gist was one of the first English-speaking explorers to travel through and write about the Ohio Country in 1749. When British traders such as George Croghan started to do business in the Ohio Country, the French and their northern Indian allies drove them out. In 1752 the French raided the Miami Indian town of \"Pickawillany\" (modern Piqua, Ohio). The French began military occupation of the Ohio Valley in 1753.\n\nBy the mid-18th century, British traders were rivaling French traders in the area. They had occupied a trading post called Loramie's Fort, which the French attacked from Canada in 1752, renaming it for a Frenchman named Loramie and establishing a trading post there. In the early 1750s George Washington was sent to the Ohio Country by the Ohio Company to survey, and the fight for control of the territory would spark the French and Indian War. It was in the Ohio Country where George Washington lost the Battle of Fort Necessity to Louis Coulon de Villiers in 1754, and the subsequent Battle of the Monongahela to Charles Michel de Langlade and Jean-Daniel Dumas to retake the country 1755.\nThe Treaty of Paris ceded the country to Great Britain in 1763. During this period the country was routinely engaged in turmoil, with massacres and battles occurring among the tribes.\n\nPrior to the American Revolution, Britain thinly exercised sovereignty over Ohio Country by lackadaisical garrisoning of the French forts. Just beyond Ohio Country was the great Miami capital of Kekionga which became the center of British trade and influence in Ohio Country and throughout the future Northwest Territory. By the Royal Proclamation of 1763, British lands west of Appalachia were forbidden to settlement by colonists. The Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768 explicitly reserved lands north and west of the Ohio as Indian lands. British military occupation in the region contributed to the outbreak of Pontiac's Rebellion in 1763. Ohio Indians participated in that war until an armed expedition in Ohio led by Colonel Henry Bouquet brought about a truce. Another colonial military expedition into the Ohio Country in 1774 brought Lord Dunmore's War to a conclusion. Lord Dunmore constructed Fort Gower on the Hocking River in 1774.\n\nAs a result of the exploits of George Rogers Clark in 1778, Ohio Country (including the territory of the future state of Ohio) as well as eastern Illinois Country, became Illinois County, Virginia by claim of conquest under the Virginia Colony charter. The county was dissolved in 1782 and ceded to the United States.\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Native Americans in the Ohio Country were divided over which side to support. For example, the Shawnee leader Blue Jacket and the Delaware leader \"Buckongahelas\" sided with the British. Cornstalk (Shawnee) and White Eyes (Delaware) sought to remain friendly with the rebellious colonists. There was major fighting in 1782. American colonial frontiersmen often did not differentiate between friendly and hostile Indians, however. Cornstalk was killed by American militiamen, and White Eyes may have been. One of the most tragic incidents of the war — the killing of 96 Christian Delaware by U.S. militiamen from Pennsylvania on March 8, 1782 at the Moravian missionary village of Gnadenhutten, known as the Gnadenhutten massacre — took place in Ohio. In May of that year, George Washington's close friend William Crawford was captured while leading an expedition against Lenape at Upper Sandusky, Ohio. Though Crawford was not at Gnadenhutten, in revenge, he was tortured for hours then burned at the stake.\n\nWith the American victory in the Revolutionary War, the British ceded claims to Ohio and its territory in the West as far as the Mississippi River to the new nation. Between 1784 and 1789, the states of Virginia, Massachusetts and Connecticut ceded their earlier land claims in Ohio Country to Congress, but Virginia and Connecticut maintained reserves. These areas were known as the Virginia Military District and Connecticut Western Reserve.\n\nStarting even before the war, and accelerating with the establishment of Fort Henry across the Ohio River in West Virginia, numerous settlers encroached on Indian lands west of the Ohio River in a broad arc from west of Fort Henry as far upriver as where Fort Steuben (today Steubenville) was later established. That there was continuous occupation of such lands is certain, though the location and continuity of any particular settlement, at least a few of which were referred to loosely as \"towns\" is very much in doubt. Most prominent among these were a series of squatters settlements with various names circa 1774 to 1795 in the area of what is today Martin's Ferry, directly across river from Fort Henry. European settlement of Ohio may fairly be said to have been in progression before establishment of the Northwest Territory and the first generally recognized town of Marietta.\n\nIn 1787, the United States created the Northwest Territory under the Northwest Ordinance of that year. Ebenezer Sproat became a shareholder of the Ohio Company of Associates, and was engaged as a surveyor with the company. On April 7, 1788, Ebenezer Sproat and a group of American pioneers to the Northwest Territory, led by Rufus Putnam, arrived at the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum rivers to establish Marietta, Ohio as the first permanent American settlement in the Northwest Territory. Marietta was founded by New Englanders. It was the first of what would become a prolific number of New England settlements in what was then the Northwest Territory. These New Englanders or \"Yankees\" as they were called, were descended from the Puritan English colonists who had settled New England in the 1600s and were members of the Congregationalist church. Correspondingly, the first church in Marietta was a Congregationalist church which was constructed 1786.\n\nColonel Sproat, was a notable member of the pioneer settlement of Marietta. He greatly impressed the local Indians, who in admiration dubbed him \"Hetuck\", meaning \"eye of the buck deer\" \"Big Buckeye\". Historians believe this is how Ohio came to be known as the Buckeye State and its residents as Buckeyes.\n\nThe Miami Company (also referred to as the \"Symmes Purchase\") managed settlement of land in the southwestern section. The Connecticut Land Company administered settlement in the Connecticut Western Reserve in present-day Northeast Ohio. A heavy flood of migrants came from New York and especially New England, where there had been a growing hunger for land as population increased before the Revolutionary War. Most traveled to Ohio by wagon and stagecoach, following former Indian paths such as the Northern Trace. Many also traveled part of the way by barges on the Mohawk River across New York state. Farmers who settled in western New York after the war sometimes moved on to one or more locations in Ohio in their lifetimes, as new lands kept opening to the west.\n\nAmerican settlement of the Northwest Territory was resisted by Native Americans in the Northwest Indian War. The natives were eventually conquered by General Anthony Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. They ceded much of present-day Ohio to the United States by the Treaty of Greenville, concluded in 1795.\n\nFurthermore, in regards to the Leni Lenape Native Americans living in the region, Congress decided that 10,000 acres on the Muskingum River in the present state of Ohio would \"be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the Moravian Brethren ... or a society of the said Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity.\"\n\nThe U.S. Congress prohibited slavery in the territory. (Once the population grew and the territory achieved statehood, the citizens could have legalized slavery, but chose not to do so.) The states of the Midwest would be known as Free States, in contrast to those states south of the Ohio River. Migrants to the latter came chiefly from Virginia and other slave-holding states, and brought their culture and slaves with them.\n\nAs Northeastern states abolished slavery in the coming two generations, the free states would be known as Northern States. The Northwest Territory originally included areas previously called Ohio Country and Illinois Country. As Ohio prepared for statehood, Indiana Territory was carved out, reducing the Northwest Territory to approximately the size of present-day Ohio plus the eastern half of Michigan's lower peninsula and a sliver of land in southeastern Indiana along Ohio's western border called \"The Gore\".\n\nWith Ohio's population reaching 45,000 in December 1801, Congress determined that the population was growing rapidly and Ohio could begin the path to statehood. The assumption was the territory would have in excess of the required 60,000 residents by the time it became a state. Congress passed the Enabling Act of 1802 that outlined the process for Ohio to seek statehood. The residents convened a constitutional convention. They used numerous provisions from other states and rejected slavery.\n\nOn February 19, 1803, President Jefferson signed the act of Congress that approved Ohio's boundaries and constitution. Congress did not pass a specific resolution formally admitting Ohio as the 17th state. The current custom of Congress' declaring an official date of statehood did not begin until 1812, when Louisiana was admitted as the 18th state.\n\nOhio played a key role in the War of 1812, as it was on the front line in the Western theater and the scene of several notable battles both on land and in Lake Erie. On September 10, 1813, the Battle of Lake Erie, one of the major battles, took place in Lake Erie near Put-in-Bay, Ohio. The British eventually surrendered to Oliver Hazard Perry.\n\nThroughout much of the 19th century, industry was rapidly introduced to complement an existing agricultural economy. One of the first iron manufacturing plants opened near Youngstown in 1804 called Hopewell Furnace. By the mid-19th century, 48 blast furnaces were operating in the state, most in the southern portions of the state. Discovery of coal deposits aided the further development of the steel industry in the state, and by 1853 Cleveland was the third largest iron and steel producer in the country. The first Bessemer converter was purchased by the Cleveland Rolling Mill Company, which eventually became part of the U.S. Steel Corporation following the merger of Federal Steel Company and Carnegie Steel, the first billion-dollar American corporation. The first open-hearth furnace used for steel production was constructed by the Otis Steel Company in Cleveland, and by 1892, Ohio ranked as the 2nd-largest steel producing state behind Pennsylvania. Republic Steel was founded in Youngstown in 1899, and was at one point the nation's third largest producer. Armco, now AK Steel, was founded in Middletown also in 1899.\n\nTobacco processing plants were founded in Dayton by the 1810s and Cincinnati became known as \"Porkopolis\" in being the nation's capital of pork processing, and by 1850 it was the third largest manufacturing city in the country. Mills were established throughout the state, including one in Steubenville in 1815 which employed 100 workers. Manufacturers produced farming machinery, including Cincinnati residents Cyrus McCormick, who invented the reaper, and Obed Hussey, who developed an early version of the mower. Columbus became known as the \"Buggy Capital of the World\" for its nearly two dozen carriage manufacturers. Dayton became a technological center in the 1880s with the National Cash Register Company. For roughly ten years during the Ohio Oil Rush in the late 19th century, the state enjoyed the position of leading producer of crude oil in the country. By 1884, 86 oil refineries were operating in Cleveland, the home of Standard Oil, making it the \"oil capital of the world\", while producing the world's first billionaire, John D. Rockefeller.\nHerbert H. Dow founded the Dow Chemical Company in Cleveland in 1895, today the world's second largest chemical manufacturer. In 1898 Frank Seiberling named his rubber company after the first person to vulcanize rubber, Charles Goodyear, which today is known as Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. Seeing the need to replace steel-rimmed carriage tires with rubber, Harvey Firestone started Firestone Tire and Rubber Company and began selling to Henry Ford. The Ohio Automobile Company eventually became known as Packard, while Benjamin Goodrich entered the rubber industry in 1870 in Akron, founding Goodrich, Tew & Company, better known as the Goodrich Corporation in the present era.\n\nBy the late 19th century, Ohio had become a global industrial center. Natural resources contributed to the industrial growth, including salt, iron ore, timber, limestone, coal, and natural gas, and the discovery of oil in northwestern Ohio led to the growth of the port of Toledo. By 1908, the state had 9,581 miles of railroad linking coal mines, oil fields, and industries with the world. Commercial enterprise began to prosper around towns with banks.\n\nWilliam Procter and James Gamble started a company which produced a high quality, inexpensive soap called Ivory, which is still the best known product today of Procter and Gamble. Michael Joseph Owens invented the first semi-automatic glass-blowing machine while working for the Toledo Glass Company. The company was owned by Edward Libbey, and together the pair would form companies which ultimately became known as Owens-Illinois and Owens Corning.\n\nWilbur and Orville Wright invented the first airplane in Dayton.\n\nCharles Kettering invented the first automatic starter for automobiles, and was the co-founder of Delco Electronics, today part of Delphi Corporation. The Battelle Memorial Institute perfected xerography, resulting in the company Xerox. At Cincinnati's Children's Hospital, Albert Sabin developed the first oral polio vaccine, which was administered throughout the world.\n\nIn 1955, Joseph McVicker tested a wallpaper cleaner in Cincinnati schools, eventually becoming known as the product Play-Doh. The same year the Tappan Stove Company created the first microwave oven made for commercial, home use. James Spangler invented the first commercially successful portable vacuum cleaner, which he sold to The Hoover Company.\n\nAfrican American inventors based in Ohio achieved prominence. After witnessing a car and carriage crash, Garrett Morgan invented one of the earliest traffic lights; he was a leader in the Cleveland Association of Colored Men. Frederick McKinley Jones invented refrigeration devices for transportation which ultimately led to the Thermo King Corporation. In Cincinnati, Granville Woods invented the telegraphony, which he sold to a telephone company. John P. Parker of Ripley invented the Parker Pulverizer and screw for tobacco processes.\n\nOhio's economic growth was aided by their pursuit of infrastructure. By the late 1810s, the National Road crossed the Appalachian Mountains, connecting Ohio with the east coast. The Ohio River aided the agricultural economy by allowing farmers to move their goods by water to the southern states and the port of New Orleans. The construction of the Erie Canal in the 1820s allowed Ohio businesses to ship their goods through Lake Erie and to the east coast, which was followed by the completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal and the connection of Lake Erie with the Ohio River. This gave the state complete water access to the world within the borders of the United States. Other canals included Miami and Erie Canal. The Welland Canal would eventually give the state alternative global routes through Canada.\n\nThe first railroad in Ohio was a 33-mile line completed in 1836 called the Erie and Kalamazoo Railroad, connecting Toledo with Adrian, Michigan. The Ohio Loan Law of 1837 allowed the state to loan one-third of construction costs to businesses, passed initially to aid the construction of canals, but instead used heavily for the construction of railroads. The Little Miami Railroad was granted a state charter in 1836 and was completed in 1848, connecting Cincinnati with Springfield. Construction of a commuter rail began in 1851 called the Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton Railroad. This allowed the affluent of Cincinnati to move to newly developed communities outside the city along the rail. The Ohio and Mississippi Railroad was given financial support from the city of Cincinnati and eventually connected them with St. Louis, while the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad crossed the Appalachians in the mid-1850s and connected the state with the east coast.\n\nThe investment in infrastructure complemented Ohio's central location and put it at the heart of the nation's transportation system traveling north and south and east and west, and also gave the state a headstart during the national industrialization process which occurred between 1870 and 1920.\n\nWater ports sprang up along Lake Erie, including the Port of Ashtabula, Port of Cleveland, Port of Conneaut, Fairport Harbor, Port of Huron, Port of Lorain, Port of Marblehead, Port of Sandusky, and Port of Toledo. The Port of Cincinnati was built on the Ohio River.\n\nFollowing the commercialization of air travel, Ohio became a key route for east to west transportation. The first commercial cargo flight occurred between Dayton and Columbus in 1910. Cleveland Hopkins International Airport was built in 1925 and became home to the first air traffic control tower, ground to air radio control, airfield lighting system, and commuter rail link.\n\nThe Interstate Highway System brought new travel routes to the state in the mid-20th century, further making Ohio a transportation hub.\n\nWith the rapid increase of industrialization in the country in the late 19th century, Ohio's population swelled from 2.3 million in 1860 to 4.2 million by 1900. By 1920, nine Ohio cities had populations of 50,000 or more.\n\nThe rapid urbanization brought about a growth of commercial industries in the state, including many financial and insurance institutions. The National City Corporation was founded in 1845, today part of PNC Financial Services. Cleveland's Society for Savings was founded in 1849, eventually becoming part of KeyBank. The Bank of the Ohio Valley opened in 1858, becoming known as Fifth Third Bank today. City National Bank and Trust Company was founded in 1866 in Columbus, eventually becoming Bank One. The American Financial Group was founded in 1872 and the Western & Southern Financial Group in 1888 in Cincinnati. The Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Insurance Company was founded in Columbus in 1925, today known as the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company.\n\nMajor retail operations emerged in the state, including Kroger in 1883 in Cincinnati, today second only to Walmart. Federated Department Stores was founded in Columbus in 1929, known today as Macy's. The Sherwin-Williams Company was founded in 1866 in Cleveland.\n\nFrisch's Big Boy was opened in 1905 in Cincinnati. American Electric Power was founded in Columbus in 1906. The American Professional Football Association was founded in Canton in 1922, eventually becoming the National Football League. The Cleveland Clinic was founded in 1921 and presently is one of the world's leading medical institutions.\n\nEducation has been an integral part of Ohio culture since its early days of statehood. In the beginning, mothers usually educated their children at home or paid for their children to attend smaller schools in villages and towns. In 1821 the state passed a tax to finance local schools. In 1822, Caleb Atwater lobbied the legislature and Governor Allen Trimble to establish a commission to study the possibility of initiating public, common schools. Atwater modeled his plan after the New York City public school system. After public opinion in 1824 forced the state to find a resolution to the education problem, the legislature established the common school system in 1825 and financed it with a half-million property levy.\n\nSchool districts formed, and by 1838 the first direct tax was levied allowing access to school for all. The first appropriation for the common schools came in 1838, a sum of $200,000. The average salary for male teachers in some districts during this early period was $25/month and $12.50/month for females. By 1915, the appropriations for the common schools totaled over $28 million. The first middle school in the nation, Indianola Junior High School (now the Graham Expeditionary Middle School), opened in Columbus in 1909. McGuffey Readers was a leading textbook originating from the state and found throughout the nation.\n\nOriginal universities and colleges in the state included the Ohio University, founded in Athens, in 1804, the first university in the old Northwest Territory and ninth-oldest in the United States. Miami University in Oxford, Ohio was founded in 1809, the University of Cincinnati in 1819, Kenyon College in Gambier in 1824, Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1826, Xavier University in Cincinnati and Denison University in Granville in 1831, Oberlin College in 1833, Marietta College in 1835, the Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware in 1842, and the University of Dayton in 1850. Wilberforce University was founded in 1856 and the University of Akron and Ohio State University followed in 1870, with the University of Toledo in 1872.\n\nThe first dental school in the United States was founded in the early 19th century in Bainbridge. The Ohio School for the Blind became the first of its kind in the country, located in Columbus.\n\nIn 2007, Governor Ted Strickland signed legislation organizing the University System of Ohio, the nation's largest comprehensive public system of higher education.\n\nRural Ohio in the 19th century was noted for its religious diversity, tolerance and pluralism, according to Smith (1991). With so many active denominations, no one dominated and, increasingly, tolerance became the norm. Germans from Pennsylvania and from Germany brought Lutheran and Reformed churches and numerous smaller sects such as the Amish. Yankees brought Presbyterians and Congregationalists. Revivals during the Second Great Awakening spurred the growth of Methodist, Baptist and Christian (Church of Christ) churches. The building of many denominational liberal arts colleges was a distinctive feature of the 19th century. By the 1840s German and Irish Catholics were moving into the cities, and after the 1880s Catholics from eastern and southern Europe arrived in the larger cities, mining camps, and small industrial centers. Jews and Eastern Orthodox settlements added to the pluralism, as did the building of black Baptists and Methodist churches in the cities.\n\nDuring the Progressive Era, Washington Gladden was a leader of the Social Gospel movement in Ohio. He was the editor of the influential national magazine the \"Independent\" after 1871, and as pastor of the First Congregational Church of Columbus, Ohio from 1882 to his death in 1918. Gladden crusaded for Prohibition, resolving conflicts between labor and capital; he often denounced racial violence and lynching.\n\nEarly Ohio state culture was a product of Native American cultures, which practically disappeared after 1790. The northeastern part of Ohio was settled by Yankees from Connecticut, and pioneers from New York and Pennsylvania. The Connecticut Western Reserve became the center for modernization and reform. They were sophisticated, educated, and open minded, as well as religious. Some of the original settlers from Connecticut were Amos Loveland, a revolutionary soldier, and Jacob Russell. They faced a rough wilderness life, where the common living arrangement was the log cabin. As the pioneer culture faded in the mid-19th century, Ohio had over 140,000 citizens of native New England origin, including New York. One of the New Yorkers who came to the state during this period was Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, whose church in Kirtland was the home of the movement for a period of time.\n\nOther early pioneers came from the Mid-Atlantic states, especially Pennsylvania and Virginia, some settling on military grant lands in the Virginia Military District. From Virginia came members of the Harrison family of Virginia, who rose to prominence in the state, producing Ohio's first of eight U.S. Presidents. William Henry Harrison's campaign of 1840 came to represent the pioneer culture of Ohio, symbolized by his Log cabin campaign. The theme song of his campaign, the \"Log Cabin Song,\" was authored by Otway Curry, who was a nationally known poet and author.\n\nOhio was largely agricultural before 1850, although gristmills and local forges were present. Clear-cut gender norms prevailed among the farm families who settled in the Midwestern region between 1800 and 1840. Men were the breadwinners who considered the profitability of farming in a particular location – or \"market-minded agrarianism\" – and worked hard to provide for their families. They had an almost exclusive voice regarding public matters, such as voting and handling the money. During the migration westward, women's diaries show little interest in and financial problems, but great concern with the threat of separation from family and friends. Furthermore, women experienced a physical toll because they were expected to have babies, supervise the domestic chores, care for the sick, and take control of the garden crops and poultry. Outside the German American community, women rarely did fieldwork on the farm. The women set up neighborhood social organizations, often revolving around church membership, or quilting parties. They exchanged information and tips on child-rearing, and helped each other in childbirth.\n\nLarge numbers of German Americans arrived from Pennsylvania, augmented by new immigrants from Germany. They all clung to their German language and Protestant religions, as well as their specialized tastes in food and beer. Brewing was a main feature of the German culture. Their villages from this period included the German Village in Columbus. They also founded the villages of Gnadenhutten in the late 18th century; Bergholz, New Bremen, New Berlin, Dresden, and other villages and towns. The German Americans immigrating from the Mid-Atlantic states, especially eastern Pennsylvania, brought with them the Midland dialect, which is still found throughout much of Ohio. For instance, in Philadelphia water is pronounced with a long \"o\" versus the normal short o, the same as in many areas of Ohio. African Americans of the Underground Railroad began coming to the state, some settling, others passing through on the way to Canada. Universities and colleges opened up all over the state, creating a more educated culture.\n\nBy the last half of the 19th century, the state became more diverse culturally with new immigrants from Europe, including Ireland and Germany. The Forty-Eighters from Central Europe settled the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood in Cincinnati, while the Irish immigrants settled throughout the state, including Flytown in Columbus. Other immigrants from Russia, Turkey, China, Japan, Finland, Greece, Italy, Romania, Poland, and other places came in the latter years. Around the start of the 20th century, rural southern European Americans and African Americans came north in search of better economic opportunity, infusing Hillbilly culture into the state. Newer ethnic villages emerged, including the Slavic Village in Cleveland and the Italian Village and Hungarian Village in Columbus. Howard Chandler Christy, born in Morgan County, became a leading American artist during this century, as well as composer Dan Emmett, founder of the Blackface tradition.\nOhio's mines factories and cities attracted Europeans. Irish Catholics poured in to construct the canals, railroads, streets and sewers in the 1840s and 1850s.\n\nAfter 1880, the coal mines and steel plants attracted families from southern and eastern Europe. By 1901, the Midwest (Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio) had absorbed 5.8 million foreign immigrants and another million by 1912.\n\nImmigration was cut off by the World War in 1914, allowing the ethnic communities to Americanize, grow much more prosperous, served in the military, and abandon possible plans to return to the old country. Flows were very low between 1925 and 1965, then began to increase again, this time with many arrivals from Asia and Mexico.\n\nIndustrialization brought a shift culturally as urbanization and an emerging middle class changed society. Athletics became increasingly popular as the first professional baseball team, the Cincinnati Reds, started playing at that level in 1869, and football leagues emerged. Bathhouses and rollercoasters became a popular past time with the opening of Cedar Point in 1870. Theaters and saloons sprang up, and more restaurants opened. Entertainment venues opening in Cleveland included the Playhouse Square Center, Palace Theatre, Ohio Theatre, State Theatre, and the Karamu House. Langston Hughes grew up in Cleveland and developed many of his plays at the Karamu House. In Columbus they opened the Southern Theatre in 1894, as well as their own Palace Theatre and Ohio Theatre, which hosted performers such as Jack Benny, Judy Garland, and Jean Harlow. The Lincoln Theatre hosted performers like Count Basie. The Taft Theatre opened in 1928 in Cincinnati.\n\nThe Roaring Twenties brought prohibition, bootlegging and speakeasies to the state, as well as the swing dance culture. Cincinnati became the headquarters of the \"king of bootlegging\" George Remus, who made $40 million by the end of 1922. The Anti-Saloon League had been powerful and Ohio, and the Women's Christian Temperance Union was still headquartered there; the Ku Klux Klan was active in the 1920s. However these organizations steadily lost influence after 1925.\n\nPerhaps the biggest invention in Ohio and the US was the invention of flight by Dayton's Orville and Wilbur Wright. Starting this invention in their bike shop in what is now Dayton's west side, the Wright's brought flight to the world in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. \nThe brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their Dayton, Ohio-based shop with printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery. Their work with bicycles in particular influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice.[14] From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903, they conducted extensive glider tests that also developed their skills as pilots. Their shop employee Charlie Taylor became an important part of the team, building their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers. The very first airplane passenger was the Wright's own mechanic, Charles Furnas of West Milton, Ohio.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the Great Depression struck the state hard. American Jews watched the rise of the Third Reich with apprehension. Cleveland residents Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created the Superman comic character in the spirit of the Jewish golem. Many of their comics portrayed Superman fighting and defeating the Nazis.\n\nArtists, writers, musicians and actors developed in the state and often moved to other cities which were larger centers for their work. They included Zane Grey, Milton Caniff, George Bellows, Art Tatum, Roy Lichtenstein, and \"king of the cowboys\" Roy Rogers. Alan Freed, who emerged from the swing dance culture in Cleveland, hosted the first live rock 'n roll concert in Cleveland in 1952. The state produced many popular musicians, including Dean Martin, Doris Day, The O'Jays and The Isley Brothers.\n\nDuring the Civil War (1861–65) Ohio played a key role in providing troops, military officers, and supplies to the Union army. Due to its central location and burgeoning population, Ohio was both politically and logistically important to the war effort. Despite the state's boasting a number of very powerful Republican politicians, it was divided politically. Portions of Southern Ohio followed the Peace Democrats under Clement Vallandigham and openly opposed President Lincoln's policies. Ohio played an important part in the Underground Railroad prior to the war, and remained a haven for escaped and runaway slaves during the war years.\n\nThe third most populous state in the Union at the time, Ohio raised nearly 320,000 soldiers for the Union army, third behind only New York and Pennsylvania. Nearly 7,000 Buckeye soldiers were killed in action. Several leading generals were from the state, including Ulysses S. Grant, William T. Sherman, and Philip H. Sheridan.\n\nOnly two minor battles were fought within its borders. Morgan's Raid in the summer of 1863 alarmed the populace. Ohio troops fought in nearly every major campaign during the war.\n\nIts most significant Civil War site is Johnson's Island, located in Sandusky Bay of Lake Erie. Barracks and outbuildings were constructed for a prisoner of war depot, intended chiefly for officers. Over three years more than 15,000 Confederate men were held there. The island includes a Confederate cemetery where about 300 men were buried.\n\nCamp Chase Prison was a Union Army prison in Columbus. There was a plot among prisoners to revolt and escape in 1863. The prisoners expected support from Copperheads and Vallandigham, but never did revolt.\n\nOhio has been involved in regional, national, and global wars since statehood, and veterans have been a powerful social and political force at the local and state levels. The organization of Civil War veterans, the Grand Army of the Republic, was a major player in local society and Republican politics in the last third of the 19th century. The American Veterans of Foreign Service was established in 1899 in Columbus, ultimately becoming known as the Veterans of Foreign Wars in 1913. The state has produced 319 Medal of Honor recipients, including the country's first recipient, Jacob Parrott.\n\nIn 1886, the state authorized the creation of the Ohio Veterans Home in Sandusky and a second one created in 2003 in Georgetown to provide for soldiers facing economic hardship. Over 50,000 veterans have lived at the Sandusky location as of 2005. Since World War I, the state has paid stipends to veterans of wars, including in 2009, authorizing funds for soldiers of the Gulf and Afghanistan wars. The state also provides free in-state tuition to any veteran regardless of state origin at their colleges.\n\nIn 1820, the legislature then passed legislation which nullified the federal court order as well as the operations of the Bank of the United States within their borders. The state ignored further federal court orders, writs, and denied immunities to the federal government. Their actions were considered the complete destruction of federal standing in the state and an attempted overthrow of the federal government. Ohio forcefully applied their iron law against the federal government until 1824, when the United States Supreme Court ruled they had no authority to tax the federal bank in the landmark case originating from the state: Osborn v. Bank of the United States. They then followed by passing an act in 1831 to withdraw state protections for the Bank of the United States.\n\nAlthough the nullification of 1820 in Ohio was inspired by resolutions passed in Virginia and Kentucky in 1798 and 1800, the language of their resolution from 1820 would find its place in South Carolina's nullification of 1832 and secession articles of southern states in 1861.\n\nThe rebellion of 1820 firmly rooted the tradition of sovereignty in the state. In 1859, Governor Salmon P. Chase reaffirmed that tradition, stating: \"We have rights which the Federal Government must not invade — rights superior to its power, on which our sovereignty depends; and we mean to assert those rights against all tyrannical assumptions of authority.\" Following the War of the Rebellion, the debate over ratification of the Reconstruction Amendments reignited the sovereignty movement in Ohio. General Durbin Ward stated: \"Fellow citizens of Ohio, I boldly assert that the States of this Union have always had, both before and since the adoption of the Constitution of the United States, entire sovereignty over the whole subject of suffrage in all its relations and bearings. Ohio has that sovereignty now, and it cannot be taken from her...\"\n\nAs recently as 2009, the tradition re-emerged, with an Ohio sovereignty resolution passing in the state senate, and signatures being collected to place a state sovereignty amendment on the ballot in 2011.\n\nOhio's roots as an anti-slavery and abolitionist state go back to its territorial days in the Northwest Territory, which forbade the practice. When it became a state, the constitution expressly outlawed slavery. Many Ohioans were members of anti-slavery organizations, including the American Anti-Slavery Society and American Colonization Society. Ohioan Charles Osborn published the first abolitionist newspaper in the country, \"The Philanthropist,\" and in 1821, the father of abolition Benjamin Lundy began publishing his newspaper the \"Genius of Universal Emancipation\".\n\nOhio was a key stop on the Underground Railroad where prominent abolitionists played a role, including John Rankin. Ohio resident Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote the famous book \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", which was largely influential in shaping the opinion of the north against slavery.\n\nAs a closely contested state, Ohio was the top choice of Republicans, and often also as Democrats, for place on the national ticket as candidate for president or vice president.\n\nBetween Lincoln and Hoover, every Republican president who did not gain the office by the death of his predecessor was born in Ohio; Ulysses Grant, although born in Ohio, was legally a residence of Illinois when he was elected.\n\nBy electing so many of her sons to the presidency, Ohio gained a role in politics disproportionate to its size. Several reasons came together. Ohio was a microcosm of the United States, balanced closely between the parties, and at the crossroads of America: between the South, the Northeast, and the developing West, and influenced by each. Its ethnic, religious, and cultural elements were a microcosm of the North. Its cutthroat politics trained candidates in how to win. A leading Ohio politician was \"Available\"—that is, well-suited and electable. Thus, in most presidential years, the governor of Ohio was deemed more available than the governor of the larger states of New York or Pennsylvania.\n\nThis legend built on itself as the state sent seven men to the White House and four more became vice president. Many others won major patronage plums. Between 1868 and 1924, not only did Ohio supply the most presidents, it supplied the most Cabinet members, and the most federal officeholders. Ohio-born Rutherford B. Hayes (1876), James A. Garfield (1880) and Benjamin Harrison (1888) were each nominated from a convention that had deadlocked, and where the delegates chose to turn to a candidate who could carry Ohio. In each case they did, and won the presidency. According to historian Andrew Sinclair, \"the potency of the Ohio myth gave its favorite sons a huge advantage in a deadlocked convention\".\n\nThe Progressive Era brought about change in the state, although the state had been at the forefront of the movement decades before. In 1852, Ohio passed its first child labor laws, and in 1885 adopted prosecution powers for violations. In 1886, the American Federation of Labor was formed in Columbus, culminating in the passage of workers' compensation laws by the early 20th century.\n\nVictoria Woodhull, the first female candidate for U.S. president in 1872, and U.S. Second Lady Cornelia Cole Fairbanks, credited with paving the way for the modern American female politician, were leaders in the women's suffrage movement. Ohio was the second state to hold a women's rights convention, the Ohio Women's Convention at Salem in 1850. The public voted on women's suffrage in 1912, which failed, but the state ultimately adopted the 19th amendment in 1920. Ohio-native and U.S. President William Howard Taft signed the White-Slave Traffic Act in 1910, which sought to end human trafficking and the sex slave trade.\n\nThe Anti-Saloon League was founded in 1893 in Oberlin, which saw political success with the passage of the Volstead Act in 1918.\n\nIn 1912 a Constitutional Convention was held with Charles Burleigh Galbreath as Secretary. The result reflected the concerns of the Progressive Era. The constitution introduced the initiative and the referendum, and provided for the General Assembly to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify laws and constitutional amendments originating in the Legislature. Under the Jeffersonian principle that laws should be reviewed once a generation, the constitution provided for a recurring question to appear every 20 years on Ohio's general election ballots. The question asks whether a new constitutional convention is required. Although the question has appeared in 1932, 1952, 1972, and 1992, the people have not found the need for a convention. Instead, constitutional amendments have been proposed by petition and the legislature hundreds of times and adopted in a majority of cases.\n\nIn the early 1920s the Ku Klux Klan attracted thousands of Protestant men into membership, warning of the need to purify America, especially against the influence of Catholics, bootleggers, and corrupt politicians. The Klan collapsed and virtually disappeared in Ohio after 1925.\n\nOhio was hit especially hard by the Great Depression in the 1930s. In 1932, unemployment for the state reached 37.3%. By 1933, 40% of factory workers and 67% of construction labor were unemployed. The state had previously supported Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, 1936, 1940, but his policies had grown out of favor with the state and they voted against him in 1944.\n\nOhio played a major role in World War II, especially in providing manpower, food, and munitions to the Allied cause. Ohio manufactured 8.4 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking fourth among the 48 states.\n\nOhio became heavily anti-Communist during the Cold War following World War II. \"Time Magazine\" reported in 1950 that police officers in Columbus were warning youth clubs to be suspicious of communist agitators. Campbell Hill in Bellefontaine became the site of a main U.S. Cold War base and a precursor to NORAD. Anti-communist personalities emerged from the state, including Janet Greene of Columbus, the political right's answer to Joan Baez. Her songs included \"Commie Lies\", \"Poor Left Winger\", and \"Comrade's Lament\". Ohio was the scene of the Kent State Massacre, where four anti-Vietnam war protesters, part of a charging mob, were shot dead, by badly frightened and poorly trained guardsmen. As the cold war wrapped up, Ohio heavily supported the elections of U.S. President Ronald Reagan and his peace-work contributions toward ending the conflict, who is the name-bearer of a highway in the Cincinnati area.\n\nOhio became an industrial magnet in the 1950s. By 1960, 10% of the population had been born in nearby Kentucky, West Virginia or Tennessee.\n\nThe Ohio Un-American Activities Committee was a government agency which existed to collect information on citizens with communist sympathies, resulting in 15 convictions, 40 indictments, and 1,300 suspects. Governor Frank Lausche generally opposed the committee, but his vetoes were overridden by the legislature. The state forced their employees to sign a loyalty oath, promising \"to defend the state against foreign and domestic enemies\", in order to receive a paycheck. Professors and Holocaust survivors Bernhard Blume and Oskar Seidlin were among those required to take the oath. Ohio barred communists from receiving unemployment benefits.\n\nOhioans have supported movie making. Five Academy Award-winning films of the late 20th century were partly produced in the state, including \"The Deer Hunter\", \"Rain Man\", \"Silence of the Lambs\", \"Terms of Endearment\", and \"Traffic\".\n\nIn the 21st century, Ohio remains connected to the regional, national, and global economies. According to U.S. Census Bureau statistics, the foreign-born share of Ohio's population increased from 2.4% in 1990, to 3.0% in 2000, to 4.1% in 2013. As of 2015, 49.7% of immigrants to Ohio had become naturalized U.S. citizens. Immigrants have substantial economic importance to Ohio, as taxpayers, entrepreneurs, consumers, and workers. A 2016 study on immigrants in Ohio concluded that immigrants make up 6.7% of all entrepreneurs in Ohio although they are just 4.2% of Ohio's population, and that these immigrant-owned businesses generated almost $532 million in 2014. The study also showed that \"immigrants in Ohio earned $15.6 billion in 2014 and contributed $4.4 billion in local, state and federal taxes that year.\"\n\nIn 2015, Ohio gross domestic product (a broad measure of the size of the economy) was $608.1 billion, the seventh-largest economy among the 50 states. In 2015, Ohio's total GDP accounted for 3.4% of U.S. GDP and 0.8% of world GDP. Ohio's GDP per capita in 2015 was $52,363, ranked 26th among the states in GDP per capita. From 2005 to 2015, \" Ohio's economy grew more slowly than the U.S. as a whole, growing at an average nominal (i.e., not inflation-adjusted) annual rate of 2.6%, compared to the U.S. average annual growth rate of 3.2% over the same time period. From 2000 to 2016, \"the pace of employment growth in Ohio has trailed the national pace..., except for the three-year period between 2010 and 2013.\"\n\nOhio had become nicknamed the \"fuel cell corridor\" in being a contributing anchor for the region now called the \"Green Belt,\" in reference to the growing renewable energy sector. Although the state experienced heavy manufacturing losses around the start of the 20th century and suffered from the Great Recession, it was rebounding by the second decade in being the country's 6th-fastest-growing economy through the first half of 2010. Politically the state has demonstrated its importance in modern presidential elections, signed international cooperation treaties with foreign provinces and northern American states, has become involved in heated national disputes with southern American states, while producing national leadership. Its athletic teams are among some of the nation's best, and culturally the state continues to produce notable artists while building institutions enshrining its past. Educationally the schools are among the nation's top performers, and militarily Ohio's legacy continues into the present era.\n\nOhio's transition into the 21st century is symbolized by the Third Frontier program, spearheaded by Governor Bob Taft around the start of the 20th century. This built on the agricultural and industrial pillars of the economy, the first and second frontiers, by aiding the growth of advanced technology industries, the third frontier. It has been widely hailed as one of the nation's most successful government bureaucracies, attracting 637 new high-tech companies to the state and 55,000 new jobs, with an average of salary of $65,000, while having a $6.6 billion economic impact with an investment return ratio of 9:1. In 2010 the state won the International Economic Development Council's \"Excellence in Economic Development Award\", celebrated as a national model of success.\n\nThe state's cities have become hubs of modern industry, including Toledo's recognition as a national solar center, Cleveland a regenerative medicine research hub, Dayton an aerospace and defense hub, Akron the rubber capital of the world, Columbus a technological research and development hub, and Cincinnati a mercantile hub.\nOhio was hit hard by the Great Recession and manufacturing employment losses during the most recent period. The recession cost the state 376,500 jobs and it had 89,053 foreclosures in 2009, a record for the state. The median household income dropped 7% and the poverty rate ballooned to 13.5% by 2009. By the second half of 2010, the state showed signs of rebound in being the nation's sixth-fastest-growing economy.\n\nDuring the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, the state was at the center of the political world as a key battleground which in the elections of U.S. President George W. Bush. U.S. House Minority Leader John Boehner of southwestern Ohio became a national political leader.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the state entered into international economic and resource cooperation treaties and organizations with other Midwestern states, New York, Pennsylvania, Ontario, and Quebec, including the Great Lakes Charter, Great Lakes Compact, and the Council of Great Lakes Governors. It became involved in heated national disputes with southern American states in 2009 and 2010, including Georgia over National Cash Register Company and Alabama over Wright Patterson Air Force Base, where southern lawmakers were accused of misusing federal funds and influence to \"steal\" Ohio jobs during the Great Recession.\n\nAthletically, the state's teams are among some of the nation's best. The Ohio State University football team won the national championship in 2002 and 2014, and consistently competes for the prize annually. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series championship in 1990 following their run as the Big Red Machine in the 1970s, as well as the National League Central Division champions in 2010 and 2012, while the Cincinnati Bengals appeared in the Super Bowl in 1981 and 1988 and have won the AFC North Division in 2005, 2009, 2013, and 2015. In 2016 the Cleveland Cavaliers won the NBA Finals, in 2007 won the Eastern Conference Championship, and in 2009 and 2010 won the NBA Central Division championships. The Columbus Quest won the only two league championships in history in the 1990s, while the Ohio State University men's basketball team advanced to the NCAA Final Four and national championship game in 2007.\n\nIn 1995 the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame museum opened in Cleveland, commemorating Ohio's contributory past to the art, including being the location of the first live rock 'n roll concert in 1952.\n\nOhio has six of the top 146 public school national universities in the nation, according to \"U.S. News and World Report's\" 2020 rankings. In 2008 it was ranked 8th by the same magazine for best high schools. Overall, in 2010 the state's schools were ranked 5th in the country by \"Education Week\".\n\nMilitarily, Ohio's legacy continues into the modern era. It has contributed over 200,000 soldiers to the Gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq wars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2164795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164795", "title": "TJ's", "text": "TJ's\n\nTJ's was a music venue and nightclub located on Clarence Place in Newport, South Wales. It opened in 1985 and shortly became a live music venue.\n\nIt was an integral part of the so-called toilet circuit and the Newport music scene, particularly catering to fans of rock music. The club was given the moniker \"The Legendary TJ's by Radio 1 DJ John Peel.\n\nTJ's closed on the death of owner John Sicolo, but his grandson Ashley now runs a similar venue named El Sieco's on nearby Market Street, which pays tribute to the sounds and interior features from the original venue.\n\nJohn Sicolo started the venue with his then wife Vivienne in 1971 as a restaurant named \"Cedar's Rest\" before becoming a burger bar named \"The Pittsburg Diner\". Sicolo bought the premises in 1973 and extended into an adjoining property to form the nightclub \"El Sieco's\", during which time a variety of musical artists, including local folk acts, performed at the premises.\n\nSome sources have suggested the venue was named using the initials of founder John Sicolo's two most important people, his sister Jeanette Sicolo, and partner Trilby Tucker, forming \"Trilby\" and \"Jeanette\".\n\nHowever others have indicated the name is a combination of Sicolo's and Tucker's, as it was Tucker was apparently the person who established TJ's as a live music venue on the premises in 1985, naming it \"Trilby\" and \"John's\".\n\nA further proposed connection exists which claims it was his daughter, Janet Sicolo, who worked with Sicolo's partner, Tucker, to save the club from bankruptcy in the 1980s, and as a result the name was changed from Sieco's to TJ's, meaning \"Trilby\" and \"Janet\".\n\nTrilby reportedly owned TJ's until her death in 1993 however media reports indicate John would then survive her ownership in the 2000s.\n\nOn 3 May 1994, the then up-and-coming Manchester band Oasis performed at TJ's following a small venue tour of the UK. The band were in South Wales frequently that year, recording at Loco Studios near Usk and Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, and had begun performing shortly after the release of their single \"Supersonic\". In a setup similar to the present day Clwb Ifor Bach, the band played to the Newport crowd on an un-raised stage, practically level with the crowd. The band performed with local group 60 Ft. Dolls, and among the concert goers were members of the Manic Street Preachers. It was later that week that Liam Gallagher was photographed for their first \"NME\" cover in Newport's King's Hotel on High Street.\n\nCatatonia filmed their single \"Mulder and Scully\" at the venue. It is allegedly the place that Kurt Cobain proposed to Courtney Love. Other bands who have played at TJ's early in their careers include The Manic Street Preachers, Green Day, The Offspring, Lostprophets, Iron Maiden, The Stone Roses, Muse, Primal Scream, Descendents, NOFX, Misfits, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Lagwagon, The Bouncing Souls, The Vandals, The Ataris, and Skunk Anansie.\n\nIn 2002, Jeff Killed John (forerunner band of Bullet for my Valentine) released their EP \"You/Play with Me\" through radio airplay on BBC Radio 1's broadcast at Newport's T.J.'s.\n\nTJ's was voted one of the top 50 'Big Nights Out' in the world by FHM in December 1997.\n\nJohn Sicolo, owner of the club throughout its period of popularity, died on 14 March 2010, aged 66. A tribute concert in his honour, headlined by Goldie Looking Chain, was held in the city's John Frost Square on 10 July 2010. On 15 September 2011 TJ's was sold at auction for £242,000.\n\nIn 2019 it was announced that the property was to become a 58-bedroom hotel, after councillors unanimously backed redevelopment plans. The development will restore the Grade II listed buildings facing onto Clarence Place, which have fallen into disrepair in recent years.\n\nEl Sieco's, on Market Street, Newport, features similar sounds and design cues from the original TJ's. The venue is adorned with salvaged memorabilia and features from TJ's premises on Clarence Place. It has been run by John Sicolo's grandson, Ashley since 2016.\n\n\n"}

Power amassed 16 points for these two results; however, he had already signed for Champ Cars' Team Australia and made no further appearance in A1GP. His replacement was seat owner Jones' son Christian Jones, who did not fare so well; round two in Germany provided no points and a best finish of fourteenth place.\n\nThe uncompetitive Jones was replaced with Will Davison for round three in Portugal, and despite a qualifying performance of 18th place and a first-lap retirement in the Sprint Race, secured sixth place and five points in the Main Race. Davison was maintained for the home round at Eastern Creek Raceway, and again provided a sixth-place Main Race result. Davison consistently scored better in the Main Race in his drives, securing a one-point tenth place in the UAE round, although retiring from the main race in Durban.\n\nContract obligations again caused a driver change when Davison switched to V8 Supercars; Australia's fourth driver of the season was Marcus Marshall, who scored the team's first podium since the opening round with a third-place finish in Indonesia.

{"id": "2164816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2164816", "title": "Subversion", "text": "Subversion\n\nSubversion (Latin \"subvertere\": overthrow) refers to a process by which the values and principles of a system in place are contradicted or reversed, in an attempt to transform the established social order and its structures of power, authority, hierarchy, and social norms. Subversion can be described as an attack on the public morale and, \"the will to resist intervention are the products of combined political and social or class loyalties which are usually attached to national symbols. Following penetration, and parallel with the forced disintegration of political and social institutions of the state, these loyalties may be detached and transferred to the political or ideological cause of the aggressor\". Subversion is used as a tool to achieve political goals because it generally carries less risk, cost, and difficulty as opposed to open belligerency. Furthermore, it is a relatively cheap form of warfare that does not require large amounts of training. A subversive is something or someone carrying the potential for some degree of subversion. In this context, a \"subversive\" is sometimes called a \"traitor\" with respect to (and usually by) the government in power.\n\nSubversion, however, is also often a goal of comedians, artists and people in those careers. In this case, being subversive can mean questioning, poking fun at, and undermining the established order in general. When a comedy or comic is referred to as being subversive, it is as much of a compliment to their work as it could be an accusation, from comics like Charlie Chaplin, Lenny Bruce, Andy Kaufman and Stephen Colbert to writers like Paddy Chayefsky, Larry Charles and Mel Brooks, to activists like Abbie Hoffman, and Michael Moore, to artists like The Yes Men and monochrom. Satire is one of the most potent forms of subversion for artists and comics, and it can take shape in films, television, books, and even political protest.\n\nTerrorist groups generally do not employ subversion as a tool to achieve their goals. Subversion is a manpower-intensive strategy and many groups lack the manpower and political and social connections to carry out subversive activities. However, actions taken by terrorists may have a subversive effect on society. Subversion can imply the use of insidious, dishonest, monetary, or violent methods to bring about such change. This is in contrast to protest, a coup d'état, or working through traditional means in a political system to bring about change. Furthermore, external subversion is where, \"the aggressor state attempts to recruit and assist indigenous political and military actors to overthrow their government by coup d’état\". If subversion fails in its goal of bringing about a coup it is possible that the actors and actions of the subversive group could transition to insurrection, insurgency, and/or guerilla warfare.\n\nThe word is present in all languages of Latin origin (see seditio), originally applying to such events as the military defeat of a city. As early as the 14th century, it was being used in the English language with reference to laws, and in the 15th century came to be used with respect to the realm. The term has taken over from \"sedition\" as the name for illicit rebellion, though the connotations of the two words are rather different, sedition suggesting overt attacks on institutions, subversion something much more surreptitious, such as eroding the basis of belief in the status quo or setting people against each other.\n\nThe problem with defining the term subversion is that there is not a single definition that is universally accepted. Charles Townshend described subversion as a term, \"so elastic as to be virtually devoid of meaning, and its use does little more than convey the enlarged sense of the vulnerability of modern systems to all kinds of covert assaults\". What follows are some of the many attempts to define the term:\n\"Subversion is the undermining or detachment of the loyalties of significant political and social groups within the victimized state, and their transference, under ideal conditions, to the symbols and institutions of the aggressor.\"\n\n\"Subversion — Actions designed to undermine the military, economic, psychological, or political strength or morale of a governing authority.\"\n\n\"Subversive Activity — Anyone lending aid, comfort, and moral support to individuals, groups, or organizations that advocate the overthrow of incumbent governments by force and violence is subversive and is engaged in subversive activity. All willful acts that are intended to be detrimental to the best interests of the government and that do not fall into the categories of treason, sedition, sabotage, or espionage will be placed in the category of subversive activity.\"\n\n\"Subversive Political Action — A planned series of activities designed to accomplish political objectives by influencing, dominating, or displacing individuals or groups who are so placed as to affect the decisions and actions of another government.\"\n\nSubversion — \"A destructive, aggressive activity aimed to destroy the country, nation, or geographical area of your enemy... [by demoralizing the cultural values and changing the population's perception of reality].\n\nSubversion — Roger Trinquier defined subversion as a term that could be lumped together under the name modern warfare, \"as being interlocking systems of actions, political, economic, psychological and military that aims at the overthrow of established authority in a country.\"\n\nDefining and understanding subversion means identifying entities, structures, and things that can be subverted. Furthermore, it may help to identify practices and tools that are not subversive. Institutions and morals can be subverted, but ideology on the other hand cannot. The fall of a government or the creation of a new government as a result of an external war is not subversion. Espionage does not count as subversion because it is not an action that leads directly to an overthrow of a government. Information gathered from espionage may be used to plan and carry out subversive activities.\n\nTo gain an understanding of what is considered to be subversive requires understanding the intent of those taking action. This makes defining and identifying subversion a difficult process. As Laurence Beilenson points out, \"to criticize a government in an effort to reform it or to change its policies is not subversion, even though such criticism may contribute to overthrow. But criticism intended to help a projected overthrow becomes subversive without regard to whether it is right or wrong.\"\n\nSubversion can generally be broken down into internal and external subversion, but this distinction is not meant to imply that each follows a specific set of unique and separate tools and practices. Each subversive campaign is different because of the social, political, economic, cultural, and historical differences that each country has. Subversive activities are employed based upon an evaluation of these factors. This breakdown merely clarifies who the actors are. While the subversive actors may be different, the soon to be subverted targets are the same. As Paul Blackstock identifies, the ruling and political elites are the ultimate targets of persuasion because they control the physical instruments of state power.\n\nInternal subversion is actions taken by those within a country and can be used as a tool of power. In most cases the use or threat of force is the last step of internal subversion.\n\nExternal subversion is actions taken by another country in cooperation with those inside the subverted country and can be used as a tool of statecraft. Foreign volunteers from another country are not enough to qualify for external subversion. The reason for this is that the individuals may legitimately share the cause of the internal subversive dissidents and have legitimately volunteered. Only when the government itself furnishes a nation with money, arms, supplies, or other help to dissidents can it be called external subversion.\n\nSubversive actions can generally be grouped into three interrelated categories:\nOther factors, while not specifically falling into these categories, may also be useful to subversive dissidents. Additionally, many tools may overlap into other groups of tools as well. As an example, subversives may infiltrate an organization for cultural subversion more so than for control. Civil unrest may be used to provoke the government into a violent response.\n\nIn order for a group to be successful in subverting a government, the group itself and its ideas must be seen as an acceptable alternative to the status quo. However, groups that work toward subverting a government, in many cases, follow ideas and promote goals that on their surface would not receive the support of the population. Therefore, \"to gain public credibility, attract new supporters, generate revenue, and acquire other resources, groups need to undertake political activities that are entirely separate, or appear separate, from the overtly violent activities of those groups. Sometimes this is achieved by infiltrating political parties, labor unions, community groups, and charitable organizations\". Infiltrating organizations is an important tool because these institutions are already seen as legitimate in the eyes of the people and provide a platform to express their ideas. When infiltrating, the dissident identifies needs of the organization and then links those needs to solutions that his ideology can provide. This was a technique that the Communist Party USA employed. Once the organization has been co-opted, the dissident can then move on to establishing ties with other groups. Furthermore, in addition to gaining possible legitimacy for its ideas the infiltration of these groups can, \"bolster political allies, attack government policies, and attract international support\". If some organizations are too difficult to infiltrate, it may be necessary to create new organizations that appear to be independent but are actually under the direction of the subversive group.\n\nThe infiltration of state organizations can provide subversive groups the opportunity to do many things to achieve their goals. The infiltration of security forces can provide information about the government's capabilities and how they plan to address the group's activities. Infiltration also provides the opportunity to plant false information, lead the government to misallocate resources, to steal funds, weapons, equipment, and other resources, and ultimately aid in weakening and delegitimizing the government. The targets of infiltration are not limited to the groups and institutions mentioned above. Economic industries and universities have also been the target for infiltration. In the case of universities, the liberal arts departments are more prone to subversion than the hard sciences.\n\nDominique Poirier, former employee and specialist in communication warfare in the French intelligence service, DGSE, describes extensively subversion in a book on the practices and methods of this agency, published in 2019, yet he rarely uses the noun “subversion,” remarkably. While presenting and describing extensively the Russian and French methods of subversion and counter-subversion, he explains that the French intelligence community in particular uses the term \"guerre de l’information\", or “information warfare”. Then information warfare subsumes a number of other nouns, sometimes of Russian origin, each denoting a specific action that may actually describe an action of subversion or counter-subversion. Coming to add to the latter difference in perception of the action of subversion, he further says that information warfare in the French intelligence community is ruled itself by active measures that the DGSE, acting as leading intelligence agency in France, adopted as an “all-encompassing” doctrine. Indeed, active measures in France would regulate not only all intelligence and counterintelligence activities, but also foreign affairs and diplomacy, domestic politics, and even the activities of the major industrial and business companies and groups in this country, since a period he locates between 1980 and 1982. For all the latter would be logically called to partake in a common and coherent effort in intelligence, counterintelligence, influence, and counterinfluence on the French soil as abroad. Actually, the French intelligence community, and the DGSE in particular, always use the nouns “interference” (\"ingérence\", in French) and “counterinterference” (\"contre-ingérence\") to name “subversion” and “counter-subversion” respectively.\nThe DGSE and one other intelligence agency of this country at least are particularly active in subversive activities abroad, often in a joint effort with the Russian foreign intelligence service, SVR RF, with a focus on the United States, Dominique Poirier specifies from firsthand knowledge and experience spanning the years 1980 to circa 2001. In the latter context, the main methods of subversion he presents as “actions of influence” and their expected results are the followings.\n\nMost French and Russian actions of subversion, and of domestic influence alike, actually are governed by the notion of minority influence as initially defined by social psychologist Serge Moscovici. However, the DGSE in particular designs all such actions in accordance with fundamentals of a scientific approach akin to behaviorism, called “behavioral biology” (\"biologie comportementale\", in French) initially established in the early 1980s by French military scientist Henri Laborit. Additionally, the narrative, or “formal aims” of the action of subversion — when there is one, as behavioral biology focuses on acting on the unconscious, or id, locating in the reptilian brain as defined by Paul D. MacLean — is defined in accordance with fundamentals in epistemology, another Russian import in French information warfare and active measures. In the latter context, minority influence unfolds in five stages that Dominique Poirier describes as follow.\n\n1. The stage revelation … aims to influence the majority in favor of / against something (social / political / economic / cultural issue). It is initiated by a small minority that spreads the message of the cause. The majority is caught by surprise, but it listens to it because it wants to know what the fuss is about, exactly.\n\n2. In the stage question …, the majority listened to the message, and it reacts negatively to it because the arguments are absurd, excessive, and clash with the dominant scale of values, conservative therefore. Consequently, the majority takes some distances with the minority it now holds in contempt. Yet the minority is unabashed and continues trying to rally more people to what it holds as “the cause” (be it rational and justified or not, regardless, in the present explanation).\n\n3. In the stage incubation …, the minority rallied to its cause a few people only, yet endowed with authority, in addition to others who are respected for their sole fame and notoriety, such as film actors, columnists, recipients of prestigious prizes, etc. All those people are opinion leaders, therefore. The motives of those opinion leaders range from sincere, selfish, to opportunistic, because a need for greater notoriety and other stakes motivate them. The latter detail is unimportant to the minority in the absolute, since what matters to it is that “the cause” be heard. In sum, the voice of the minority now has a potent echo chamber that validates its cause. At this stage, a psychological phenomenon settles. The cause takes a new form that dismisses any further need to prove the validity of its substance. Many in the majority think that they can no longer ignore the minority, although its cause is now reducing to a few crafted slogans that repeat.\n\n4. The stage conversion marks the moment at which many in the majority begin to acknowledge the rightfulness of the cause of the minority, even if not sincerely since the arguments supporting its message did not change, or evolved and now are different, or even are no longer mentioned. In reality, the volte-face is largely motivated by a misperception that is a belief in an already ongoing adjustment of values in the majority, or “peer pressure per proxy” initiated by the few celebrities and the media. At this point, the action of influence really transforms into a manipulation.\n\n5. The last stage innovation is reached when the cause of the minority has been widely acknowledged, to a point of being seen now as “a norm universally accepted in the country,” even though this is untrue in the facts. The hardheaded people who stick to the old values together are the new minority. Those who are embracing the cause believe sincerely that they are not straying nor are influenced. Quite on the contrary, because they ever stick to the scale of values of their country, “which obviously changes along the natural and normal evolution of the society,” they think. Besides, they assume that they are not granted any authority great enough to oppose the voices of the many who together are the public opinion, nor have the nerve to question a cause that famous and respected persons endorse. Moreover, the people of the former majority now see the remaining dissenters as “excessively conservatives, hardheaded, or even reactionaries,” thus turning the issue and its pro and con arguments upside down. The change does not lay on an understanding of the cause and of the validity of its arguments, since that is not what brought the change of values to happen, but truly and unconsciously on an innate and therefore hardly repressible \"need for belonging\" / \"belongingness\" that originally was a herd instinct caused by a need for safety.\n\nFormally speaking, the narrative that is the message of the cause actually is an action of influence, whose substance is strictly regulated, as explained below.\n\nEstablishing an action of influence claims the three following elements, plus a fourth when the circumstances are favorable.\n\n1. The context, which is the political / social / economic / cultural situation(s) of the target country.\n\n2. The expectation, which is the need / claim or object of the discontent of the minority or majority.\n\n3. The message of influence, which are the myth and its narrative that the specialists of the intelligence agency design according to what 2. specifies, and to the actions chosen for spreading / voicing them.\n\n4. The echo chamber, which of course consists in making other media relaying the action defined in 3.\n\nThen the action of influence must include the following four steps.\n\nA. Victimization of the minority or majority, which must be presented in terms chosen to arouse passionate feelings in the masses.\n\nB. “Culpabilization” of the ruling elite or assimilated to it, which is the first goal of the action to be reached.\n\nC. Call for redemption, addressed to the ruling elite or assimilated, which is the second goal of the action to be reached.\n\nD. Mending / reparation, which must be elicited from the ruling elite or assimilated, final goal of the action.\n\nIt is understood that the action in four steps above actually is a manipulation of the masses rather than an action influence. Its objective is to force the ruling elite or assimilated to comply to the demand of the minority, since the former collectively is the only one that is not fooled. As the action is all about passion and at no point about reason, reaching successively and successfully each of its four steps consists in winning the minds of the masses along three successive objectives called “battles,” explained below.\n\na. The battle of ideas or logos, which is an over-simplification or reformulation of “the cause” / claims, designed by the experts in influence of the intelligence agency to be easily assimilated by masses of people. The messages are slogans therefore, by opposition to their elaborate forms that would claim long sentences or even an entire paragraph, unsuitable to an action aiming to arouse passionate feelings. In other words, the \"battle of ideas\" is about caricaturing an issue rather than just putting strong emphasis to it. The targeted politician or ruling elite or / and their actions are criminalized instead of being simply questioned, and the “concerning situation” must be transformed into an “emergency”.\n\nb. The battle of emotions or pathos, which must arouse feelings or moods among the masses, such as anger, shame, joy. The emotions are triggered with meta-communication, such as crying or expressing sorrow in a convincing manner when presenting the narrative. Music and songs conveying the narrative, associated to pictures in a video, theatrical demonstrations, shows, and use of arts and symbols, also trigger emotions. Of late in 2018-2019, actions of influence and disinformation are done by manipulating or indoctrinating young teenagers or even preteens, in order to elicit the same emotions from the masses. In other words, the \"battle of emotions\" is about transforming a worry into a dramatic situation, and changing concern for hysteria in the minds of the masses.\n\nc. The battle of values or theos, consists in doing acts meant to show to the masses that the cause / aims do not limit to spoken and written words, pictures, music or songs, demonstrations, and shows, and that commitment to the myth and its narrative indeed extends to physical realities. Therefore, those acts can be striking physically against anti-riot police forces, throwing eggs against a politician, burning one’s voting card or a flag before a journalist cameraman, destroying a statue before a crowd, suing the State or a president, etc. All such acts that consist in transforming the thought into action in the sense of motion also are relevant to meta-communication, and they call for physical action by relying on meme. The involvement of people in the battle of values is the ultimate form of commitment to the cause / aims, and it is an important stage that is needed when the masses who committed to the cause / aims at some point start to tire of words and are expecting real effects. In other words, the \"battle of values\" is about pushing the masses to “excommunicating” the ruling elite or the politician instead of simply asking for a change of attitude.\n\nDominique Poirier insists on the fact that since the expected effects of the methods of subversion as described above are all defined by fundamentals of behavioral biology, they limit to an alternative with three basic reactions only, which are,\n\n1. fighting,\n\n2. fleeing, and\n\n3. inhibition, or inhibition behavior.\n\nThe order in the enumeration above is logically understandable, even though the unconscious part of the brain that orders them does not process logics. When in the face of any impediment, threat, or aggression, first, we fight; second, we flee if we cannot fight; and third, we yield to inhibition when neither fighting nor fleeing is possible. The thoughtful process of conversion of these drives into actions is largely conditioned by logic in Man, but much less so when he acts in a group because this other factor greatly stimulates “herd instinct,” a by-product of the need to being, as we shall see in several chapters of the Part II. Anyway, knowing this allows predicting accurately the response of someone to his manipulation, regardless of his intellectual capacities. It is even possible to improve further this accuracy, or even to transform it into an inescapable outcome, by arranging circumstances that will deny to this individual his options to \"fighting\" and to \"fleeing\". Therefore, this will leave him with one option only, which is \"inhibition behavior\".\n\nDominique Poirier presents a number of other types of actions serving subversion abroad and domestic influence, indifferently, about all sophisticated in their principles because they address the unconscious and do not call for any thoughtful process to occur in the minds of masses they aim. He specifies that some of the latter methods are highly effective due to a difficulty to identify them formally as actions of subversion, and resulted in successes in the French-speaking regions of Belgium and Switzerland in the 2000s and 2010s. \n\nFinally, while talking specifically about actions of subversion abroad serving political influence and cultural influence, which he subsumes this time in the field of psychological warfare, he describes their actions and expected reactions as follow.\n\nThe ruling elite of the attacked country is collectively tormented with a set of particular techniques, methods, and tricks, which all aim to overwhelm its members, to weaken them morally, and to demonize them in the eyes of the nations they lead, in order to justify their “elimination” in the end. These techniques, methods, and tricks are the followings, ...\n\n1. All the following methods must be used in fashions allowing their plausible denial at any time. Therefore, the latter concern claims suitable efforts focusing on the rallying of third parties, which mainly are individuals fit to act as opinion leaders, generally unaware of the real aims they serve. Those opinion leaders are supported by promotion given from distance to them and to their actions, relying on conventional and more exotic media. In general, the methods rely on communication in all its possible forms.\n\n2. Rallying the masses around causes designed to arouse passion, and avoiding causes calling for reason. Causes based on reason are poorly energetic, harder to promote, and difficult to spread quickly among the masses, therefore. Then the nature of a cause may be either positive (“for”) or negative (“against”). The preference must be given to negative causes, because they call for a violence necessary for the expected change to occur, and because they aim a short-termed goal. Arousing thoughtless passion and fighting reason among the targeted masses are cardinal rules in influence, agitprop, and disinformation.\n\n3. The negative causes can be very varied, ranging from true facts selected in the biographies and political and economic records of the members of the ruling elite to be attacked, or they can be fabricated; they aim to demonize them anyway. Therefrom, the negative causes can be true isolated facts, whose gravity must be suitably emphasized and presented as generalities, inclinations, and vices. Entirely fabricated facts must be avoided, although the regular releases of various false negative facts (\"i.e.\" disinformation campaign) together have a proven effectiveness, for constant repetitions of facts, true, false or both, regardless, overwhelm the thoughtful process in the minds of the masses. When numerous and varied false negative facts are publicly released with a fast frequency, people give up quickly in their efforts to check them one by one, and they are inclined to believe that “they cannot all be false” due to their number. Furthermore, the credit popularly given to the attacked ruling elite decreases as its members feel forced to disprove a too important number of facts one by one and on a row, regardless of their authenticity.\n\n4. Strong emphasis added on negative facts transforms them into strong arguments. In the latter case, the effort in the disinformation campaign actually focuses on the added emphases rather than on the facts themselves, which truly are of minor importance and disproportionate to the claims when considered objectively. Yet the masses never do the latter effort, nor are ready to give time enough to themselves to enquire on the validity of an accusation; they rely entirely on the media and on rumors instead.\n\n5. Positive facts about the attacked ruling elite must be ignored / dismissed rather than challenged. Challenging positive facts is also making them better known than they are already.\n\n6. Creating “toxic” friends and allies for the attacked ruling elite. Finding out third parties with images and notorieties that the masses perceive negatively, or creating such parties claiming closeness in values / opinions / ideas with the attacked ruling elite (\"i.e.\" demonization by association).\n\n7. Arranging and then recording “toxic” relations and encounters between members of the attacked ruling elite, in order to transform their records into clues / evidences suggesting / supporting a fabricated rumor about anything is clashing with the scale of values of the masses (\"e.g.\" sex, corruption, collusion, particular / exotic political or religious ideas, disputable statements, stances, and postures with respect to conventions, etc.).\n\n8. Driving morally the targeted ruling elite into “a corner,” to forcing them into doing anything is thoughtless, and then treating the move / statement / attitude with the method #4 (\"i.e.\" demonization).\n\n9. Finding out isolated negative facts, excerpts in texts and selections in pictures and video putting the attacked ruling elite at its disadvantage, and treating this material with the method #4.\n\nThe objective of the basics above limits to bringing political changes in the target country. The other basics below are relevant to information warfare and to cultural influence, essentially. They must be used either in association with those above when the goal is an effective but more or less official takeover of a country, or not necessarily when the goal limits to weakening this country in preparation to its ulterior takeover (\"i.e.\" warming up the masses of the attacked country, or \"awareness raising\").\n\n10. Overall, the main objective of this second set of actions limits to sowing and to breeding doubt in the minds of the masses about everything is positive in the perception they have of their country and of its scale of values in general, and not necessarily about their feelings for their ruling elite. Therefore, it is not about making the masses endorsing a cause, but only about undermining their confidence, to the point of making them feeling less safe and comfortable in their country than they were until then. In turn, the ill feelings must gradually evolve toward incredulity, and then doubt, especially towards the core values of their country since the goal is to prepare the masses to the acceptance of new values ultimately.\n\n11. Challenging and questioning the scale of values of the masses of the target country through persistent and various actions of cultural influence ...\n\n12. Breeding doubt in the masses about facts and news by insisting on the negative perception that anyone may have of them. Media hyping true negative news that are poorly or not at all reported in the attacked country (\"i.e.\" \"awareness raising\"). Doing the same with positive facts and news about other countries and culture and / or their scales of values challenging those of the target country (\"i.e.\" importing foreign white propaganda). Overt black propaganda must be avoided altogether, since success with this method largely relies on subtle disinformation and \"information dosage\" and fuzzy logic.\n\n13. Sowing discord among the masses by dividing them into minorities over issues that can be either fabricated or that are already existing in an inchoate form (\"i.e.\" \"awareness raising\"). Those issues may be of minor importance or even imagined regardless, because the goal limits to weaken or to eradicate feelings of unity around core national / cultural values in the attacked country. The worrying issues, however, and preferably, must have in common to be or to appear to be caused passively or actively by the ruling elite, its current politics, rules, and regulations. Thus, each of the minorities and their particular causes will breed inescapably common resentment aiming the ruling elite and its current politics, rules, and regulations, and thus, together they will make up for a majority federated by a common discontent.\n\n14. Infiltrating permanently all political parties of the attacked country with a focus on the most popular and on those whose popularity are rising. The political color of a party to be infiltrated is unimportant, because the goal is to secure in it a capacity in influence over politics, public services, and the military, once it will be in power, if ever. Moderately extremist parties (\"i.e.\" far right and far left) are of particular interest: first, due to their greater dynamism, and second, because of the easy reversibility of their programs, and stances of their grass rooters. Far extremist parties and their hardliners are of poor interest, because they attract small minorities only, whose members are unable to access positions of responsibilities and power, typically.\n\n15. Whenever possible, founding new political parties, associations, labor unions, and liberal masonic grand lodges and lodges in the attacked country, by recruiting its citizens having suitable profiles. Recruiting or assisting / helping discreetly leaders of minority parties, associations, and labor unions, that are already established and whose views are clashing with the orthodoxy enforced by the ruling elite and the dominant / conservative scale of values. The goal with those leaders and the collective bodies of individuals they lead is to use them as media / proxies voicing suitable messages of influence and disinformation. A focus must be given on women, because they are more receptive than men are to the \"call for passion\". More than 50% of women in all countries are more receptive to progressive values and stand by them.\n\n16. Spotting public servants whose views may serve the attack, and helping / assisting them rise in their respective hierarchies. The same must be done with people who, in general, have positions and professional notorieties that endow them the status of natural and influential opinion leaders (\"e.g.\" experts, politicians, senior officials, religious leaders, scientists, journalists, artists, etc.). The main characteristic of interest in those people is their sincere commitment to a cause, idea, belief, or concept that may serve the attack in some way. In this respect, exactly as in advertising, women preferably young and handsome are recruits of greater interest, due to their superior ability to seduce. Then women often demonstrate greater aggressiveness and determination than men in adversity. Additionally, independently of genre, selecting recruits who visibly are from third-world countries regardless of their generations, because the interest in such opinion leaders is their natural capacity to inhibit opponents, lest of accusations of racism or xenophobia that always prove potent additional means of defense causing further inhibition / inaction.\n\n17. In universities, spotting talents whose views are similar to these presented in #16, and helping them gaining positions of interest with respect to the aims. In general, penetrating and influencing the educational system of the target country is of particular interest when this is possible, and often fruitful. Schools and universities where the future elites of the country are customarily taught are prime targets.\n\n18. In the methods #1, #15, #16 and #17, note that recruiting those types of individuals as \"conscious agents\" is not the goal, and must be avoided, therefore. Instead, the suitable method is to make profit of their natural qualities, opinions, and known stances, in order to shelter them effectively against all suspicions of collusion and accusation of espionage and foreign influence. Interactions with them must never be direct (\"i.e.\" working them through \"screens\"), and must limit to their manipulations and to anonymous helps / assistance / promotion / media-hype. Moreover, influencing them must be avoided because they must be selected according to the quality and strength of their natural opinions, precisely. For the record, 1. the best agent is someone who ignores that he is one; 2. never try to change the ideas and beliefs of someone meant to be recruited to serve this type of operation, and find a way to use them and their opinions advantageously, instead.\n\n19. In general, arousing resentment against the dominant scale of values and the ruling elite among already existing minorities, regardless of what they are and what their claims may be, to thus making them natural allies in the attack. In other words, the silent frustrations of those minorities must be aroused enough to give rise to spoken claims (\"i.e.\" \"awareness raising\"). In this goal, identifying all natural social and cultural minorities, and influencing them into claiming a distinct identity. All societies are made of minorities, and arousing resentment in each against the scale of values maintained by the ruling elite makes them together a powerful majority, yet all along unaware of the real aims that thus they serve.\n\nSpecial operations of the kind and scale presented above focus on influencing the masses by manipulating a limited number of individuals in reality, who thus are all made \"unconscious agents\". For the very high stakes and sensitivity of such operations forbid the explicit recruitment of citizens of the attacked country as agents, under-agents, \"contacts\", or \"sources\". The exception to this rule concerns journalists, because, 1. they are legally allowed to investigate on sensitive matters, 2. the strong alibis of freedom of speech and freedom of the press shield them against all accusation of influence and propaganda, 3. the two latter points put them in capacity to serve consciously the interests of a foreign power, as agents or \"sources\", without running the risk to fall under the accusation of intelligence with a foreign power, except in certain authoritarian regimes.\n\nWhen the explicit recruitment of opinion leaders as agent is undertaken, then the goal is to serve the methods #6 and #7. In this case, the desired effect is to discredit and to demonize a prominent party representative and his party, therefore, because their existence and action are impingements in the unfolding of the operation.\n\nIn general, in the French and Russian doctrines in intelligence, a rule says that a recruiter must look for people whose ideas likely to serve the objectives are “natural,” and that the recruiter must never attempt to change their natural opinions and beliefs. Nothing and no pattern in their biographies, records, investigation, and possible interviews that may be led by the local counterintelligence must give rise to suspicions of collusion or recruitment by a foreign intelligence agency or assimilated to it.\n\nThe expression “awareness raising” “was a Soviet import that occurred in France during the preparatory stage of the riots and general strikes of May 1968. It happened in the early months of the latter year, first as a sophisticated technique in agitprop known in the Soviet KGB under the name сенсибилизация (“siencibilizatz’iya”), otherwise used in the other field of epistemology in Soviet Union. In France, the latter Russian word was given definitively the translation \"sensibilisation\" (without equivalent in English) circa March 1968, as this word, sounding similar, already existed with other meanings in this country. The latter facts explain why \"sensibilisation\" / \"awareness raising\" is the same in its principle as the other method of \"minority influence\" in agitprop.” “An action of \"awareness raising\" in active measures may aim to influence the opinion of the public in one’s own country or that of a foreign country or both, and its goal is to make masses of people receptive to a concern that may be either true and founded, or false and ill-founded in reality, or neither entirely true and founded nor entirely false and ill-founded but “somewhere between these two absolutes”. The latter hypothesis, which often is expected in active measures, is explained and ruled by the disciplines of fuzzy logic and chaos theory, and generally aims to breed doubt, confusion, or inhibition, and then angst, discontent, or fear in the minds of people.\n\nRemarkably, French experts in domestic influence and subversion use colloquially the noun “sleepwalkers” (\"somnanbules\", in French) to call “all ordinary people composing the masses. The reason justifying the choice of this noun, pejorative in a sense, is that an overwhelming majority of ʻordinary peopleʼ is unable to make the difference between neutral and objective information (news) and influence and propaganda. As seen from the viewpoint of specialists, the whole population behaves as millions of \"sleepwalkers\" ready to believe anything the media, authors, and agents of influence tell and write, indifferently. The reason explaining the naiveté is that people tend to believe at its face value everything is formally published and broadcast, by wrongly attributing some official and unanimously approved virtue to media such as print and audiovisual periodical publications, books, and similar. Then the greater the number of people truly or apparently involved in the publishing / broadcasting of a fact or fallacy is, the truer it seems to be in the understanding of the masses. Additionally, the greater the known number of people who watched, listened, or read the fact or fallacy is, the greater the probability is that ʻit is true indeed,ʼ still in the understanding of the masses. … Moreover, in France, specialists in influence and counter-influence are tasked to prevent the masses of people / \"sleepwalkers\" from “waking up” and understanding that they actually are thus fooled permanently, and by which methods and tricks they are so, since their own country fabricates and spreads fallacies for them either. In other words, about the latter explanation, teaching the masses on methods and techniques in foreign influence would be effective and salutary, doubtless, but at the same time it would reveal to them the influence and propaganda that their own government tailors and spreads for them. ... In the DGSE, a rule alluding colloquially to this particular definition of sleepwalker says, \"Ils dorment; ne les réveillez pas\" (“They [the masses] sleep, don’t wake them up”). Edgar Morin, French communist philosopher, sociologist, intelligence officer, and founder of modern methods and techniques of mass influence and manipulation is at the origin of this particular use of the word sleepwalker. Morin often said, \"“Eveillés, ils dorment”\" (“Awaken, they sleep”), quoting his own way Greek philosopher Heraclitus. Thus, Morin implied that, as taken collectively, ordinary people who constitute the masses are too stupid to make the difference between the truth, influence, propaganda, and disinformation. For the record, the exact and complete English translation of Morin's quote above is, “All men do walk in sleep, and all have faith in that they dream: for all things are as they seem to all, and all things flow like a stream”\n\nEconomics can be both a tool of the internal and external subversive. For the external subversive simply cutting off credit can cause severe economic problems for a country. An example of this is the United States' relations with Chile in the early 1970s. In an attempt to get Salvador Allende removed from office, the United States tried to weaken the Chilean economy. Chile received little foreign investments and the loss of credit prevented Chile from purchasing vital imports. An economic pressure of this kind prevents an economy from functioning and reduces a country's standard of living. If the reduction is too great, the people may become willing to support a change in the government's leadership. The main objective of economic pressures is to make it difficult for the country to fulfill its basic obligations to the citizenry either by cutting off trade or by depriving it of resources.\n\nThe internal subversive can also use economics to put pressure on the government through use of the strike. An example of this is the Chilean Truckers’ Strike during the 1970s. The strike prevented the transport of food staples and forced nearly 50% of the national economy to cease production. Activities of these kinds create human, economic, and political problems that, if not addressed, can challenge the competency of the government.\n\nAs defined by Laurence Beilenson, agitation is \"subversive propaganda by action such as mass demonstrations or the political strike, that is, a strike not intended to benefit the union or workers in the ordinary sense, but intended instead against the government\". Furthermore, propaganda and agitation, even when they are legal forms of freedom of speech, press, and assembly can still be classified as subversive activity. These tools further demonstrate the need to determine intent of those taking action to identify subversive activities.\n\nCivil unrest creates many of the problems that an insurgency campaign does. First of all it is an affront to government authority, and if the government is unable to quell the unrest it leads to an erosion of state power. This loss of power stems from the people's lack of trust in the government to maintain law and order. In turn, the people begin to question whether or not new leadership is needed. Discrediting, disarming, and demoralizing the government is the goal of these activities and the cause of the government's loss of power. Civil unrest depletes resources as the government is forced to spend more money on additional police. Additionally, civil unrest may be used to provoke a response from the government. In the 1940s communists in France during strikes against the Marshall Plan would, \"deliberately provoke the police and gendarmerie into acts of repressive violence in order to exploit the resulting 'martyrs to the cause' for propaganda purposes\". These martyrs and subsequent propaganda can be useful in turning political and social groups against each other. The less violent forms of unrest, \"such as worker absenteeism, passive resistance, boycotts, and deliberate attempts to cripple government agencies by 'overloading the system' with false reports, can have powerfully disruptive effects, both economically and politically\".\n\nOffensive terror can be defined as the killing of people, destruction of property, kidnapping, etc. It is usually a minor part of subversion and, \"is used not to exert force in the transfer of state power, but is meant to cower the people or ruler\". Force used in this manner is meant to reinforce other forms or persuasion in addition to cowering the people or leaders. Additionally, much like civil unrest and agitation, it raises the question of whether or not the state can provide security for the population. Terror also provides a practical motivation of physically removing political opponents. The assassination of an organization's leader may open the door to a successor that is more friendly to the subversives position or possibly someone that has successfully infiltrated the organization and is in fact one of the subversives.\n\nBribery is one of the most common tools of subversion. Most societies see bribery as a form of corruption and it used as a subversive tool because it, \"implies the undermining of existing rules of political or moral conduct\". It can also be one of the less reliable tools as well. Bribed officials are only useful if they take action. However actions taken over a period of time draw suspicion from the public. The official must be able to carefully conceal their actions or perform only key functions and action. For these reasons bribed officials are most effective when they are asked to take immediate action. In the case of external subversion, bribery is usually used for influence rather than for actions.\n\nRecent writers, in the post-modern and post-structuralist traditions (including, particularly, feminist writers) have prescribed a very broad form of subversion. It is not, directly, the parliamentary government which should be subverted in their view, but the dominant cultural forces, such as patriarchy, individualism, and scientism. This broadening of the target of subversion owes much to the ideas of Antonio Gramsci, who stressed that communist revolution required the erosion of the particular form of 'cultural hegemony' within society.\n\nTheodor Adorno argued that the culture industry and its shallow entertainment was a system by which society was controlled through a top-down creation of standardized culture that intensified the commodification of artistic expression; in 1938 he said that capitalism has colonized every aspect of life so much that \"every pleasure which emancipates itself from the exchange-value takes on subversive features\".\n\nUsing culture to bring about change to a political system through integration of political warfare and political action and the targeting of cultural vehicles and institutions is another tool of subversion. The use of the arts or more broadly culture is primarily a tool for external subversives, as internal subversives are generally citizens of the country and share the same culture. It is a tool that takes a longer period of time to implement and its effects are revealed over time, as opposed to those of a terrorist attack or civil unrest. Therefore, one could classify this tool as an element of strategic subversion. The targets of cultural subversive activities are traditionally film, literature, popular music, educational institutions, mass media, religious organizations, charitable organizations and other forms of art. The intended results of these activities are to persuade or co-opt publics, discredit the ideas of enemies and splitting factions within the enemy's camp.\n\nThe state is charged with the protection of the civilizational values of society (liberty, equality, comradeship, compassion, democracy, education, the family, religion, rule of law, human and civil rights, etc.), \"including the cultural/aesthetic values that enhance the quality of life and maintain its legitimacy\". In situations where the government is not being a good steward in protecting these values, the use of tools like literature, film, music can be used as a reminder of these values, as well as a forum to protest and question the government's legitimacy. Additionally, art and culture allow people to connect on an emotional level that could soften negative perceptions one may be believed to have. Once the stigma has been removed, the target may be more receptive to other messages conveyed. This individual or group would no longer be seen as being completely different from them. Another example of how culture can be subversive is seen in Iran. Western culture, media, art, etc. is popular among the country's youth, but certain elements are banned or curtailed. As the exportation of Western culture continues, conflict between the state and its citizens is created. The government is then seen as unresponsive or out of touch with its people.\n\nSubversive activity is the lending of aid, comfort, and moral support to individuals, groups, or organizations that advocate the overthrow of incumbent governments by force and violence. All willful acts that are intended to be detrimental to the best interests of the government and that do not fall into the categories of treason, sedition, sabotage, or espionage are placed in the category of subversive activity.\n\nSubversion () is a crime in China. The government of the People's Republic of China prosecutes subversives under Articles 102 through 112 of the state criminal law. These articles specify the types of behavior that constitute a threat to national security and China has prosecuted many dissidents including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo using these laws. Of these, Articles 105 and 111 are the ones most commonly employed to silence political dissent. Article 105 criminalizes organizing, plotting, or carrying out subversion of the national order, or using rumor mongering or defamation or other means to incite subversion of the national order or the overthrow of the socialist system. Article 111 prohibits stealing, secretly collecting, purchasing, or illegally providing state secrets or intelligence to an organization, institution, or personnel outside the country.\n\nSubversion is a crime in Italy (\"\"), under Article 283 of Italian criminal law (\")\" and \"\", under Articles 270 and 270-bis.\n\nThere is no crime defined as \"subversion\" (as opposed to treason) in British constitutional law. Attempts have been made to introduce definitions but there is no general consensus among political and legal theorists.\n\nHistorically MI5 were entrusted with the legal investigative powers for concerns of threats to national security by subversion, but in the Security Service Act 1989, subversion was not mentioned, and according to the official MI5 website, subversion is no longer investigated, due to a reduced threat as a result of the end of the Cold War and of associated political situations since the 1980s.\n\nThe founders of the United States wanted to avoid charges of subversion. As such they justified their resistance to the British government through the use of the private citizen argument and the doctrine of the lesser magistrate in the United States Declaration of Independence.\n\nAs related above, members of the Communist Party were supposed by legislators to be subversives, especially after the Russian Revolution. The House Un-American Activities Committee was formed in 1938 in order to investigate alleged disloyalty and subversive activities on the part of private citizens, public employees, and those organizations suspected of having Communist ties. Senator Joseph McCarthy became the most visible public face of a period in which Cold War tensions fueled fears of widespread Communist subversion. The term \"McCarthyism\", coined in 1950 in reference to McCarthy's practices, including public attacks on the character or patriotism of political opponents, was soon applied to similar anti-communist activities. Senator Pat McCarran sponsored the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950 and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, both of which were hotly contested in the law courts, and by Harry Truman, who went so far as to veto the former; however, the veto was overridden in the Senate by a margin of 57 to 10.\n\nIn 1943, the Stone court ruled in a bitterly contested fashion that an avowed publisher of the Communist doctrine could be naturalized a citizen of the US, in \"Schneiderman v. United States\", .\n\n\"Aptheker v. Secretary of State\" tested in 1964 whether a passport could be disallowed to a Communist. Aptheker won.\n\n\"Elfbrandt v. Russell\" involved questions concerning the constitutionality of an Arizona Act requiring an oath from state employees. William O. Douglas wrote in 1966 for a strongly divided court the majority opinion that the State could not require the oath and accompanying statutory gloss.\n\nThe Warren court ruled by 5–4 majority in \"Keyishian v. Board of Regents\" (of SUNY) to strike down New York State law that prohibited membership by professors in any organization that advocated the overthrow of the US government, or any organization that was held by the Regents to be \"treasonous\" or \"seditious\". The Regents also required teachers and employees to sign an oath that they were not members of the Communist Party.\n\nSubversion (Persian: براندازی ; Romanization : \"barandāzi\") is a crime in Iran.The government of Islamic Republic of Iran prosecutes subversives under Articles 498 through 500, 507 and 508 of Iran's criminal laws. \n\n\n"}

He was a teacher at Charles Hays Secondary School. He was also more recently the president of the Prince Rupert District Teachers Union, a local of the British Columbia Teachers' Federation.\n\nCoons was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Soon after he was born his family moved to Lachine, Quebec, which was, at that time, a city outside of Montreal.\nIn 1967, he moved to Burlington, Ontario where he began his lifelong love affair with hockey, playing junior \"B\" with the Burlington Mohawks. He graduated from Nelson High School which he attended from grades 11 to 13. After graduating, Coons attended the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario where he received his BA in Mathematics and his Bachelor of Education, with specializations in Math and Physical Education. Throughout his school years, Coons continued playing hockey, playing junior \"A\" hockey with the St.Thomas Elgins from 1970-71 before moving up to the Mustangs university team. While playing on University of Western Ontario hockey team, Coons claimed a university league record for penalty minutes.\n\nIn 1976, after completing his education, Coons moved to Prince George where he worked for a juvenile detention center with kids in need. Coons left Prince George when he was hired as a special education teacher at Prince Rupert's Booth Memorial Junior Secondary school in 1977. He worked as a teacher for three years before he resigned, in 1980, to co-ordinate the 1981 Northern BC Winter Games, which were held in Prince Rupert. Once the games were completed, Coons tried his hand in the commercial fishing industry, working on a gill-netter for a short time.\n\nIn 1981, Coons married Lois Elliot, another teacher in Prince Rupert. She currently teaches at Pineridge school. Together, they have two children, Hannah and Breton. In 1982, Coons returned to teaching at Booth Memorial Junior Secondary, this time as a math teacher. In 1986, Coons became the head instructor at Kaien Alternate school, this continued until 1992, when he went on a teaching exchange to Australia. After his exchange to Australia, Coons was back in Prince Rupert, teaching, this time at Charles Hays Secondary School. He taught the subjects of math and physical education. His love of sports led Coons to coach recreational activities on a community level, including baseball, soccer and hockey.\n\nThroughout this time, Coons was active in the British Columbia Teachers' Federation. His commitment to social justice and activism led him to sit on committees and to participate in many roles in the BCTF from 1983-2005. His first experience with a major political movement was in 1983, when the Solidarity Coalition rallied against twenty-seven Bills the provincial legislature had introduced. Coons joined more than 50,000 unionists and other demonstrators in protesting the Bills, which attacked human rights, labour, education, and social programs in British Columbia.\n\nCoons served as president of the Prince Rupert District Teachers' Union from 2001-2004. During his time as president of the union, Coons participated in political actions; this led him to put his name forward as a nominee for the NDP for the 2005 election. He won the nomination, and, eventually, the seat.\n\n"}

His sister was married to Imagawa Yoshitada, a major daimyō from a prestigious cadet branch of the Ashikaga family. Shinkuro became a retainer in the Imagawa clan, and when Yoshitada died in battle in 1476, Shinkurō mediated the succession dispute between supporters of Yoshitada's son Imagawa Ujichika and Yoshitada's cousin, Oshika Norimitsu. This proved a temporary peace. When Norimitsu again attempted to gain control of the Imagawa clan, Sōun came to Ujichika's defense, killing Norimitsu. Sōun was rewarded by Ujichika with Kokukuji castle. He gained control of Izu Province in 1493, avenging a wrong committed by a member of the Ashikaga family which held the shogunate.
