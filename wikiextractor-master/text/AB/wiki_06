An ancient capital of the country that once served as an important Islamic port town, Suhar has also been credited as the mythical birthplace of Sinbad the Sailor.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Suhar's population was 140,006, making it Oman's fifth most-populated settlement. Described as an industrial town, the development of the Sohar Industrial Port during the 2000s has transformed it into a major Omani industrial hub.\n\nAs the largest town in the region, it has been argued that Suhar is identified with the ancient town called 'Omanah' () mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his \"Natural History\". This settlement is believed to have given Oman its name.\n\nAccording to Al-Tabari, in 893 or 894, during the Abbasid era, there was a dispute about who should rule Oman amongst local factions. A faction that approached the Abbasids was the Bani Sama, who were based in Al-Buraimi or Tawam, before moving to Sohar. Bani Sama also referred to themselves as the Wajihid Dynasty, and assumed leadership over the region. The present-day town of al-Buraimi is part of a historical region that Tabari referred to as 'Tawam', which nowadays also includes the adjacent UAE city of Al Ain.\n\nBy the 10th century, Sohar was one of the richest ports of the Persian Gulf. It was praised by Ibn Hawqal and al-Muqadsasī, who called it \"flourishing, populous, beautiful, pleasant and delightful\" and compared it favourably with the ports of China. Aloes, wood, bamboo, sandalwood and spices were brought from India and frankincense from Dhofar. The city was sacked by the Buwayhids in 971 and its trade went into decline. It also suffered from attacks by the merchants of Kish across the gulf. By the 13th century, it was part of the Kingdom of Hormuz. It was still an international port until at least the 16th century.\n\nIn the early 16th century , Sohar was conquered by the Portuguese empire , to control the entrances of the Persian Gulf and trade in the Region.It was part of a web of fortress that the Portuguese had in the region , from Bahrain to Hormuz. It was drawned in the 17th century as it appears in the António Bocarro Book of fortress.\n\nSuhar is currently experiencing significant investment and economic shifts making it the focus of attention of many local and international investors and businessmen. This change is due to a series of investment projects and economic giant in Suhar industrial area where Port of Sohar is located. Established in 2002, the port has a strategic importance due to its nearness to the Strait of Hormuz. It is operated by Suhar Industrial Port Company (SIPC) and it is considered a world class port. With current investments exceeding $12 billion, it is one of the world’s largest port development projects.\n\nThe Omani government has paid special attention to the city of Suhar, and placed it in the priorities of the future plan of the Omani economy in 2020. The goal of the Omani government is to make Suhar a business and industrial hub and help the Omani economy diversify away from oil. In order for the Omani economy to achieve this economic diversification, the Omani government is investing in a number of projects in the industrial area of Suhar. For example, it is investing more than $5 billion in the steel industry in which Oman aims to be one of the Gulf Cooperation Council's leading producers. In addition to the steel industry, there is also the industry of aluminium in Suhar industrial area. Sohar Aluminium Company was established in 2004 and it is considered one of the leading projects that play a major role in the sultanate’s economic diversification strategy.\n\nSuhar has four high educational institutes:\n\nSuhar also has a number of international schools such as:\n\nSuhar has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification \"BWh\") with very hot summers and mild winters. Precipitation is low; more than half of the year's total rainfall falls in February, and summers are almost completely dry.\n\nSuhar has four main parks. The first is Suhar Park, located in Al Humbar. The second is the Silver Jubilee Park which is located in Sallan. The third is the Entertainment Park in Sanaiyyah. The fourth is in falaj alqabail.\nAnd it has many other parks like Alminyal, Alsanqar, Alsuwaihra, Al-ons, Corniche park and Aluwaynat park.\n\nThe city also has the Sohar Regional Sports Complex.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Design work on the prototype space gun began as early as 1985 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and became operational in December 1992. It is the largest gas gun in the world.\n\nRather than a single straight barrel, the SHARP gun uses an L-shape design with two separate sections; the long steel combustion section & pump tube section is connected to the long launch tube (or barrel) at a right angle. 100-ton rail-mounted sleds sit at both ends of the pump tube to absorb recoil energy from firing and a smaller 10-ton sled is mounted on a perpendicular set of tracks at the aft-end of the launch-tube near the junction point.\n\nThe firing sequence begins with the ignition of a methane gas mixture in the combustion section behind the piston at the far end of the pump tube. The resultant explosion rapidly drives the 1-ton steel piston down the pump tube and further compresses the pre-pressurized hydrogen gas that fills the other end of the pump tube. As the piston accelerates toward the junction point, it rapidly compresses the hydrogen gas in the pump tube to a pressure of . The small projectile, meanwhile, rests in the adjacent depressurized launch tube. As the hydrogen gas reaches maximum pressure, a coupling holding the projectile in place is destroyed and the hydrogen drives the projectile down a 4-in diameter barrel at extremely high velocities until it bursts through a thin plastic sheet covering the end of the gun. All recoil forces are absorbed by the rail-mounted sleds as they are propelled outwards along their tracks.\n\nHeaded by John Hunter, the SHARP gun fired projectiles using expanding hydrogen and achieved velocities of or Mach 8.8 for projectiles. Had the project continued, there were plans to elevate the tube and begin space launch trials potentially reaching speeds of up to , or about Mach 21.\n\nThe tests were designed as a precursor to the \"\"Jules Verne Launcher\",\" an even larger light-gas gun with a barrel length designed in the early 1990s for first-stage satellite launch. This was to cost $1 billion, but funding was not forthcoming and the project was eventually canceled in 1995. However, the SHARP gun continued to be used for high-speed tests in other areas of research, such as scramjet development.\n\nThe concept of ballistic escape velocity is well proven. The largest challenge is maintaining such high velocities, because air resistance and aerothermal heating will significantly slow down any such object.\n\n"}

After a period of driving when a turbocharger has been working hard, it is important to let the engine run at idle speed for a period, allowing the compressor assembly to cool from the lower gas temperatures in both the exhaust and intake tracts. At the same time the lubricating oil from the engine is able to circulate properly so the turbine won't burn the lubricating oil that would otherwise be trapped within the charger with the turbine rotating at high speed. With regard to modern automotive turbochargers, the need for a turbo timer can be eliminated by simply ensuring the car does not produce any 'boost' (during driving) for several minutes prior to the ignition being shut off.\nMost turbo timers are based on digital electronics.\n\nTurbo timers can usually be disabled by an external switch, this is normally done using the handbrake switch, or using an automatic one.\n"}

According to him, there is no archaeological indication of an Aryan migration into northwestern India during or after the decline of the Harappan city culture. Instead, Shaffer has argued for \"a series of cultural changes reflecting indigenous cultural developments.\" According to Shaffer, linguistic change has mistakenly been attributed to migrations of people. Shaffer gives two possible alternative explanations for the similarities between Sanskrit and western languages. The first is a linguistic relationship with a \"Zagrosian family of language linking Elamite and Dravidian on the Iranian Plateau,\" as proposed by McAlpin; according to Shaffer \"linguistic similarities may have diffused west from the plateau as a result of the extensive trading networks linking cultures in the plateau with those in Mesopotamia and beyond,\" while also linking with the Kelteminar culture in Central Asia. Yet, Shaffer also notes that the Harappan culture was not extensively tied to this network in the third century BCE, leaving the possibility that \"membership in a basic linguistic family - Zagrosian - may account for some of the linguistic similarities of later periods.\" The second possibility is that \"such linguistic similarities are a result of post-second millennium B.C. contacts with the west.\" According to Shaffer, \"[o]nce codified, it was advantageous for the emerging hereditary social elites to stabilize such linguistic traits with the validity of the explanations offered in the literature enhancing their social position.\"\n\n\n"}

She made but one organizational change during her active career and that came in the latter part of 1921 when she was reassigned to Division 29, Squadron 10.\n\nIn 1922, the anti-militarist feeling prevalent following World War I combined with the government's policy of financial retrenchment to cause the deactivation of a substantial portion of the Navy's recently expanded destroyer fleet; \"Tingey\", therefore, was placed out of commission on 24 May 1922, berthed at San Diego, and remained there for the remainder of her career. After 14 years of inactivity, \"Tingey's\" name was struck from the Navy list on 19 May 1936. She was sold to the Schiavone-Bonomo Corporation, of New York City, on 29 September 1936 and was scrapped in December.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1922100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922100", "title": "Convair XB-46", "text": "Convair XB-46\n\nThe Convair XB-46 was a single example of an experimental medium jet bomber which was developed in the mid-1940s but which never saw production or active duty. It competed with similar designs, the North American XB-45 and Martin XB-48, all of which saw little use after the successful development of the Boeing XB-47.\n\nIn 1944, the War Department was aware of aviation advances in Germany and issued a requirement for a range of designs for medium bombers weighing from to more than . Other designs resulting from this competition, sometimes named the \"class of '45\", included the North American XB-45 and the Martin XB-48. Procurement began with a letter contract (cost-plus-fixed-fee) on 17 January 1945 with mockup inspection and approval in early February. Orders for three prototypes followed on 27 February 1945 with certain changes recommended by the board. Serials \"45-59582\" to \"59584\" were assigned. Budgetary concerns also led to the contract being changed to a fixed-price type.\n\nIn the fall of 1945, Convair found it was competing with itself when the USAAF became interested in an unorthodox forward-swept wing jet attack design, the XA-44-CO that the company had also been working on. With the end of World War II severely curtailing budgets, the company considered canceling the XB-46 in favor of the other project as there was insufficient funding for both. Company officials argued that it made more sense to allow them to complete the XB-46 prototype as a stripped-down testbed omitting armament and other equipment and for the AAF to allow them to proceed with two XA-44 airframes in lieu of the other two XB-46s on contract. In June 1946, the AAF agreed to the substitution but that project was ultimately cancelled in December 1946 before the prototypes were completed. The B-46 would be completed with only the equipment necessary to prove its airworthiness and handling characteristics.\n\nThe XB-46 had a long streamlined oval torpedo-shaped fuselage, long narrow straight shoulder-mounted wings with four Chevrolet-built J35-C3 axial-flow eleven stage turbojets of static thrust paired in an integral nacelle under each wing. The fuselage turned out to be a problem, as it distorted under flight loads. The pilots sat in tandem in a pressurized fighter-style cockpit under a single Plexiglas teardrop canopy with the bombardier-navigator-radio operator in a transparent Plexiglas nose section.\nThe straight wing had an aspect ratio of 11.6, and was equipped with Fowler flaps which extended over 90 percent of the span, in four sections. The flaps extended via electrical actuators, and had very small ailerons. Each wing had five spoilers made of perforated magnesium alloy. The engine air intakes were flat oval inlets, with a duct curving downward in a flat “S” to the engines, which were mounted behind the leading edge of the wing. The unusual flight control system utilized a system of pneumatic piping to transmit the pilots control inputs and actuate various systems, rather than the more typical hydraulic, manual or electrical control lines and systems of most aircraft of the era.\n\nProduction versions were to be equipped with a pair of .50 caliber Browning M2 machine guns in a tail turret designed by Emerson Electric Company and provision was made for an APG-27 remote control optics and sighting system, but no weaponry was fitted into the prototype. Likewise, production aircraft were intended to be built with the General Electric J47 engines with static thrust rather than the J35s used on the prototype.\n\nThe XB-46's first flight occurred 2 April 1947 after a month of taxi testing, and lasted ninety minutes as the bomber departed the Convair plant in San Diego, California for Muroc Army Airfield in the high desert. The pilot praised its handling qualities. Basic flight testing took place for five months, and by September 1947 it was concluded after 127 hours aloft on 64 flights by both the Convair company and AAF test pilots. Stability and control were excellent but there were engineering problems with engine de-icing, the cabin air system, and vertical oscillations caused by harmonic resonance between the wing and spoilers. There was also concern regarding the ability of the three man crew to exit the aircraft in case of an emergency, since the exit plan relied on the pneumatic system to hold the main door open against the airstream. The aircraft was accepted on 7 November and delivered on 12 November 1947.\n\nThe B-46 program was cancelled in August 1947, even before flight testing had been completed, because it was already obsolete. The North American B-45 Tornado already had production orders, and even it would be eclipsed by the Boeing B-47 Stratojet's superior performance. Furthermore, the bulky radar fire-control system which was not installed in the XB-46 prototype would have undoubtedly forced an expensive redesign of the slender fuselage. Subsequent testing investigated excessive noise, tail vibration, and stability and control issues, and was conducted at Palm Beach Air Force Base, Florida between August 1948 and August 1949. After 44 additional flight hours, the XB-46 was taken out of service, since the cost of support and maintenance, coupled with a lack of spare parts, had become prohibitive. After sitting idle for a year, it was flown to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in July 1950, where its pneumatic system was tested under the coldest conditions in the large climatic facility there. Most jet aircraft of this period used hydraulic or electrical systems, so the pneumatic control system of this aircraft offered a unique opportunity for investigation. When this testing program was concluded in November 1950, the Air Force no longer had need for the XB-46, a fact acknowledged in the press as early as August, and on 13 January 1951 the nose section was sent to the U.S. Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, although it appears that the airframe section has not survived in the collection. The rest of the airframe was scrapped on 28 February 1952.\n\n\n"}

UOB Plaza One was one of the three tallest in the city, sharing the title with the OUB Centre and Republic Plaza, but it is now the second tallest since the construction of Tanjong Pagar Centre in 2016. UOB Plaza Two is a shorter and older building with construction completed in 1973 and was later renovated in 1995 with a similar facade as UOB Plaza One. Both buildings are connected by a podium supported by four columns. The podium houses the banking hall of the United Overseas Bank's main branch. The building was opened by then Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew on 6 August 1995 which was 60 years after the founding of the United Overseas Bank.\n\nThe UOB Plaza is a 280.1 m tall 66-floor high-rise, three-story underground building built at Raffles Place, Singapore's Central Business District, along the Singapore River. It is a box-shaped post-modernism building which was designed by Kenzo Tange, a renowned Japanese architect, and was constructed by Nishimatsu Construction and Lum Chang JV. It was completed in 1992.\n\nBuilt as the head office of the United Overseas Bank, one of Singapore's leading banks, the building was also one of the country's tallest skyscrapers along with the adjoining OUB Center and Republic Plaza until it was succeeded by the Tanjong Pagar Centre.\n\nThere are two buildings that make up the Plaza, which are divided into the high-rise \"Plaza 1 (UOB Plaza One)\" and the low-rise \"Plaza (UOB Plaza Two)\". Among them, \"Plaza 2\" was built in 1973 before it was remodeled in 1995.\n\nThe materials, colors, shapes and overall image of the building closely resembles the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, which was completed in Shinjuku, Tokyo in 1990 which was also designed by Kenzo Tange.\n\nUOB Plaza Two is a building with 38 floors and was completed in 1973 with the building reconstructed again in 1995. The building was formerly called the Bonham Building and housed the former United Chinese Bank (now the United Overseas Bank) before it changed to the current name in 1965.\n\nThe towers have an octagonal base and consists of rotated cubic volumes, which is a distinctive stylistic expression of Kenzo Tange's works in the 1990s. The cubic volumes on the octagonal base, they rotate on a 45 degree plane of reference and diminish in volume towards the top of UOB Plaza One. A six-storey podium links the two buildings together and skillfully accommodates the reconstructed UOB Building (now UOB Plaza 2). This place is a large airy atrium linking Raffles Place to Singapore River without entering the building. The banking hall has full height glass walls to see through the Singapore River from the financial district. The change in lighting brings out the geometric qualities of the building's architecture, highlighting the buildings with shafts of light and shadow. The external curtain wall system of the building represents a significant and innovative contribution of the evolution of building facades over time. The \"performance wall\" envelope of the towers is a composite of white and grey granite and insulated grey glass units. The atrium is also known as a \"city room\" and above it has a large office space and a large skylight, which gives the place natural lighting. A double storey sky lobby could be found on the 37th and 38th floors, which provide panoramic views of the city. It is also used for workers to transfer lifts from the lower floors to the higher floors. However, the sky lobby has been closed to the public due to security reasons after the September 11, 2001 attacks. There are two sculptures on the ground floor; \"Homage To Newton\" by Salvador Dalí in the city room, and another designed by Fernando Botero.\n\n"}

MacProject was one of the first major business tools for the Macintosh which enabled users to calculate the \"critical path\" to completion and estimate costs in money and time. If a project deadline was missed or if available resources changed, MacProject recalculated everything automatically.\n\nMacProject was written by Debra Willrett at Solosoft, and was published and distributed by Apple Computer to promote the original Macintosh personal computer. It was developed from an earlier application written by Debra Willrett for Apple's Lisa computer, LisaProject. This was the first graphical user interface (GUI) for project management. There were many other project management applications on the market at the time, but LisaProject was the first to simplify the process by allowing the user to interactively draw their project on the computer in the form of a PERT chart. Constraints could be entered for each task, and the relationships between tasks would show which ones had to be completed before a task could begin. Given the task constraints and relationships, a \"critical path\", schedule and budget could be calculated dynamically using heuristic methods.\n\nOne of the early proponents of MacProject was James Halcomb, a well known expert in the use of the Critical Path Method. Having supervised hand-drawn network diagrams for countless complex projects, Halcomb immediately recognized the promise of the WYSIWYG graphical interface and computerized calculation of the critical path. Using a Lisa computer housed in a case designed to fit under an airplane seat, Mr. Halcomb traveled the United States demonstrating this new technology in his CPM courses. In consultation with the software's developers he authored the book \"Planning Big with MacProject\", which introduced a generation of Mac users to PERT and CPM.\n\nIn December 1987, an updated version of MacProject, called MacProject II, was introduced as a part of Claris's move to update its suite of Mac office applications.\n\nIn 1991, Microsoft Project was ported to the Macintosh from Microsoft Windows and became MacProject's main competitor. However, after the release of version 3.0 of Microsoft Project in 1993, Microsoft terminated support of the Macintosh release.\n\nMacProject 1.0 is not Y2K-compliant as it cannot schedule tasks past 1999.\n\n\n\n"}

Departing somewhat from the commercial sound of his previous release, the massively successful \"Purple Rain\" (1984), the album instead saw Prince experimenting with psychedelic styles and more opulent textures. In compliance with Prince's wishes, the record company released the album with minimal publicity, withholding accompanying singles until almost a month after the album's release.\n\n\"Around the World in a Day\" was released to notably mixed reception after the success of \"Purple Rain\", though it nonetheless sold relatively well and became Prince and the Revolution's second number-one album on the \"Billboard\" 200.

Eichner (March 23, 1937February 10, 1988) was an American post-Keynesian economist who challenged the neoclassical price mechanism and asserted that prices are not set through supply and demand but rather through mark-up pricing.\n\nEichner is one of the founders of the post-Keynesian school of economics and was a professor at Rutgers University at the time of his death. Eichner's writings and advocacy of thought, differed with the theories of John Maynard Keynes, who was an advocate of government intervention in the free market and proponent of public spending to increase employment. Eichner argued that investment was the key to economic expansion. He was considered an advocate of the concept that government incomes policy should prevent inflationary wage and price settlements in connection to the customary fiscal and monetary means of regulating the economy.\n\nHe is noted for his book \"The Megacorp and Oligopoly\" (1976), \"Toward a new economics: essays in post-Keynesian and institutionalist theory\" (1985). His \"Macrodynamics of Advanced Market Economies\" (1987) contains chapters on dynamics and growth, investment, finance and income distribution.\n\nEichner was born in Washington, D.C., in the United States. He received his doctorate in economics from Columbia University. He taught at Columbia from 1962 until 1971. Later he taught at SUNY Purchase (1971–1980), and then joined the Rutgers University faculty.\n\nSome books edited by Eichner include \"A Guide to Post-Keynesian Economics\", \"Why Economics Is Not Yet a Science\", and \"The Macrodynamics of Advanced Market Economies\". Eichner testified before Congressional and other legislative committees\n\nTogether with Eli Ginzberg, a professor of economics at Columbia, Eichner authored an economic history of African Americans, \"The Troublesome Presence: The American Democracy and the Negro,\" published in 1964.\n\nThese co-authors wrote that... “of the several million persons who reached Great Britain’s North American colonies before 1776, it is conservatively estimated that close to 80 percent arrived under some form of servitude.”\n\nSome mainstream economists have argued that assumptions about the character of economic reality in the neoclassical economic paradigm are fundamentally flawed. Points arguably making a convincing case that the mathematical theories used by neoclassical economists cannot be viewed as scientific have consistently been made by trained economists. Alfred Eichner in \"Why Economics Is Not Yet a Science\" offers the following commentary on the discipline of economics as a social system:\n\n...'The refusal to abandon the myth of the market as a self-regulating system is not the result of a conspiracy on the part of the “establishment” in economics. It is not even a choice that any individual economist is necessarily aware of making. Rather it is the way economics operates as a social system—including the way new members of the establishment are selected—retaining its place within the larger society by perpetuating a set of ideas which have been found useful by that society, however dysfunctional the same set of ideas may be from a scientific understanding of how the economic system works. In other words, economics is unwilling to adhere to the epistemological principles which distinguish scientific from other types of intellectual activity because this might jeopardize the position of economists within the larger society as the defender of the dominant faith. This situation in which economists find themselves is therefore not unlike that of many natural scientists who, when faced with mounting evidence in support of first, the Copernican theory of the universe and then, later, the Darwinian theory of evolution, had to decide whether undermining the revelatory basis of Judeo-Christian ethics was not too great a price to pay for being able to reveal the\ntruth.'\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Tri-City Americans have also been featured in the television series \"Z Nation\" episode \"Day One\".\n\nThe Tri-City Americans franchise is an original franchise of the WHL. They began in 1966 as the Calgary Buffaloes before being renamed the \"Centennials\" after one season. The franchise was also known as the Billings Bighorns from 1977–82 before relocating to Nanaimo, British Columbia as the Nanaimo Islanders. After only one season, they moved to New Westminster, British Columbia to become the second incarnation of the New Westminster Bruins. They moved to the Tri-Cities in 1988.\n\nThe Americans enjoyed local support until early 2000, the start of 4 owners in 4 years, all wanting to relocate the team to Canada. Between selling off team assets and one owner banning the local newspaper columnist from attending games, the attendance dropped considerably. The lack of any notable championships didn’t help matters either. Although the ownership group represented by Darryl Porter had stated upon purchasing the team that they would create a local presence (the oft-heard criticism of the ownerships groups), Mr. Porter had still not moved to the Tri-Cities in his 3rd year of ownership. In 2004, Porter attempted to move the team to Chilliwack, British Columbia in Canada. However, the other Western Hockey League teams voted to prevent the move, including all four other American teams as well as 2 Canadian teams. Shortly after this failure, the team was sold to Tri-Cities natives, including Olaf Kolzig, the former goalie for the Washington Capitals, and Stu Barnes of the Dallas Stars, both former Americans players. Since the sale the team has doubled attendance figures and won the first division championship in team history. Porter and his investment group were later granted the Chilliwack Bruins as an expansion franchise.\n\nOn November 29, 1989 Americans goaltender Olaf Kolzig became the first goalie to register a WHL goal when he successfully shot on an empty net against the Seattle Thunderbirds.\n\nThe Americans annual series with the Highway 395 rival Spokane Chiefs is always intense and full of action, clearly their biggest rival year in and year out. The competitiveness of the two team is such that an annual tradition with the Americans is to play the Chiefs at home on New Year's Eve. The only time this tradition was broken was due to a one-day strike by the Americans over the training tactics of one of the coaches.\n\nIn the 2002–03 season, sixteen-year-old goaltender Shannon Szabados became the first female player to compete in the WHL when she played one game for the Americans. In 2010 Szabados won gold in Women's Ice Hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics playing for Canada.\n\nDuring the 2007–08 WHL season, the Americans won the US Division regular season championship for the first time after a March 15, 2008 game against division rival Spokane Chiefs in Kennewick, Washington at the Toyota Center. The Americans won the Western Conference regular season championship, and the Scotty Munro Memorial Trophy for the best overall regular season record in the WHL. The 2009–10 Season marked the third straight year the Americans won the US Division.\n\nAt their annual New Year's Eve game against the Spokane Chiefs on December 31, 2008, the Americans set a record for attendance at a hockey game in the Toyota Center, with 6,042 attendees. The Americans surpassed this number on March 13, 2010, in a game against Spokane, with an attendance of 6,053.\n\nThe Americans won the Western Conference championship for the first time in the 2010 playoffs defeating the Chilliwack Bruins, Kelowna Rockets and Vancouver Giants in successive series before dropping the league championship to the Calgary Hitmen in 5 games.\n\nThe Americans are charitably-active in the Tri-Cities area. Years ago, the Americans were one of the first teams to do 'The Teddy Bear Toss', which was originally called 'Toy Trick'. This is where the fans would throw stuffed animals onto the rink on a selected night when the home team scores their first goal. The players collect the bears and hand them out to various organizations or the players take them along with them when they visit children in the local hospitals.\n\nA definite first at the Tri-City rink was the Breast Cancer night. Brian Sandy, Senior VP of business operations and Chief Marketing Officer, dreamed up this event, where the ice is tinted pink and the players wear pink jerseys that are auctioned-off at the end of the night. The game on February 2, 2008, every jersey sold for the maximum donation of $500 each, with all proceeds supporting breast cancer research.\n\nThe Americans also were active in raising start-up funds for the establishment of a local chapter of The First Tee. Players visit schools and hospitals weekly and assist the young hockey players with their practices. Links are provided on their website to other organizations like the local Humane Society, and opportunities have been provided to the Children's Developmental Center to volunteer to aid in the seating at games for a $15,000 check at the season's conclusion.\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties OTL = Overtime losses Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against\"\n\n\n<section begin=roster /><br>\n\n\n"}

The company makes domestic appliances and personal care products. \n\nOriginally a German consumer electronic company, Grundig GmbH was founded in 1945 by Max Grundig and eventually headquartered in Nuremberg. It grew to become one of the leading radio, TV, recorder and other electronics goods manufacturers of Europe in the following decades of the 20 century. In the 1970s, Philips began acquiring Grundig AG's shares, leading to complete control in 1993. In 1998, Philips divested Grundig. In 2007, Koç Holding bought Grundig and put the brand under its home appliances subsidiary Arcelik A.Ş. Koç is a publically-listed conglomerate with more than 80,000 employees.\n\nGrundig began in 1945 with the establishment of a store named Fürth, Grundig & Wurzer (RVF), which sold radios and was headquartered in Fürth, northern Bavaria. After the Second World War, Max Grundig recognized the need for radios in Germany, and in 1947 produced a kit, while a factory and administration centre were built at Fürth. In 1951, the first television sets were manufactured at the new facility. At the time Grundig was the largest radio manufacturer in Europe. Divisions in Nuremberg, Frankfurt and Karlsruhe were established.\n\nIn 2013, Grundig launched its home appliances (white goods) product range, becoming one of the mainstream manufacturers in Europe. Parent Arcelik A.Ş., has more than 27,000 employees worldwide. Grundig has manufacturing plants in several European cities that deliver Grundig products to more than 65 countries around the world.\n\nGrundig started as a typical German company in 1945. Its early notability was due to \"Grundig radio\". Max Grundig, a radio dealer, built \"Heinzelmann\" which was a radio that did not use thermionic valves. The first of the same was named the 'Weltklang'.\n\nBased on Heinzelmann success, Grundig started a factory. This allowed the company to start \"Grundig TV\". This was created for the first German television channel which started in 1952. The company then developed a portable tape recorder and The Grundig Television Receiver 210.\n\nA plant was opened in 1960 to manufacture tape recorders in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the first production by Grundig outside Germany. The managing director of the plant, Thomas Niedermayer, was kidnapped and later killed by the Provisional IRA in December 1973. The factory was closed with the loss of around 1000 jobs in 1980.\n\nIn 1972, Grundig GmbH became Grundig AG. After this Philips began to gradually accumulate shares in the company over the years, and assumed complete economic control in 1993. Grundig pulled out of this partnership in 1998 owing to unsatisfactory performance and the decline in Philips consumer electronics presence around the world.\nGermany's first colour television projector was started by Grundig in 1981. The next year, the second generation electronic notepad was developed and marketed. Philips increased its stake in the company and Max Grundig no longer controlled business management in 1984.\nIn 1991, Grundig entered the telephony equipment market starting with its cordless telephone. In 1993, the Grundig TV was based on a 16:9 picture format for signal transmission. In 1995 and 1996, the company included 3-D sound systems, TVs, satellite receivers and other initiatives that included interactive user guidance. However, Philips ended its stake in the company by 1997-8.\n\nAt the end of June 2000 the company relocated its headquarters in Fürth to Nuremberg-Langwasser. Grundig had a turnover of €1.281 billion the following year. In autumn 2002, Grundig's banks did not extend the company's lines of credit, leaving the company with an April 2003 deadline to announce insolvency. Grundig AG declared bankruptcy in 2003. In 2004 Britain's Alba plc and the Turkish Koç's Beko jointly took over Grundig Home InterMedia System, Grundig's consumer electronics division. In 2007 Alba sold its half of the business to Koç for US$50.3 million, although it retained the license to use the Grundig brand in the UK until 2010, and in Australasia until 2012.\n\nIn 2007 Grundig Mobile announced the U900 Linux-based mobile phone.\n\nAt the end of 2007 Turkey's Koç Holding, took full ownership of Grundig Multimedia, the parent company of Grundig Intermedia GmbH in Nuremberg.\n\nThe company continued on to entertainment electronics, electrical and home appliances. Eventually, company entered the goods sector in 2013 becoming EU's only consumer electronics company covering the full range.\n\nGrundig's headquarters are in Frankfurt, Germany. Worldwide, the Grundig company employs an additional 1,600 people in production, R&D and sales. Grundig designs products aiming for the highest energy conservation. The company is organized into three product groups – consumer electronics, small domestic appliances and large household appliances.\n\nGrundig has been the first, official technology partner of the German Bundesliga since 2011. In addition to that the Nuremberg football Stadium is called Grundig Stadium until the end of 2015.\n\nGrundig continued its German \"Bundesliga Official Technology Partnership\" in 2014. The Grundig logo has been a permanent display item during all Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2 broadcasts since 2012/13 until 2014/15.\n\nGrundig is also the name sponsor of Norwegian Women's and Men's Handball Leagues.\n\nFurthermore, Grundig continued its sponsorship with Fenerbahçe Women's and Men's Volleyball Teams and sponsored many international golf tournaments in 2014.\n\nGrundig launched the \"Respect Food\" initiative with the goal of underlining the seriousness of the food waste problem to reduce global food waste which is the 2nd topic of the UN’s 2030 sustainable development goals.\n\nGrundig offers household appliances and electronic goods.\n\nTelevision: Grundig offers a wide range of LED televisions.\n\nRadio: Grundig produced several ranges of transistor radios. These included the small portable \"Yacht Boy\" radios for mariners, with FM, LW, MW, and up to 12 SW bands for worldwide coverage.\n\nAudio: Grundig audiovisual product range offers HIFI Systems, soundbars and Bluetooth speakers.\n\nHome appliances: manufactured by Grundig include fridges, freezers, ovens, stoves, hobs, hoods, microwaves, warming drawers, washing machines and dryers.

{"id": "1922142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922142", "title": "Spokane Chiefs", "text": "Spokane Chiefs\n\nThe Spokane Chiefs are a major junior ice hockey team that plays in the Western Hockey League based out of Spokane, Washington. The team plays its home games at the Spokane Arena. Their uniforms are similar to those of the NHL's Montreal Canadiens. Spokane consistently ranks in the top 10 in the Canadian Hockey League in attendance. The Chiefs won the Memorial Cup in 1991 and 2008. They also hosted the first outdoor hockey game in WHL history on January 15, 2011, at Avista Stadium versus the Kootenay Ice.\n\nThe Spokane Chiefs was the name of the hockey team that played in the Western International Hockey League (WIHL) from 1982 to 1985. In their final year, the Chiefs were the regular season champions of the WIHL.\n\nThe current franchise was granted in 1982 to Kelowna, British Columbia, as the Kelowna Wings. In 1985, the team relocated to Spokane, Washington, and became the Chiefs. Before the Spokane Chiefs, there was another WHL franchise in Spokane, the Spokane Flyers, which played between 1980 and 1982.\n\nThe Chiefs won the WHL and CHL Memorial Cup championships in 1991 and 2008. In addition, they have won two division titles and four Western Conference championships. The Chiefs and Portland Winter Hawks are the only United States based teams to win the Memorial Cup. The Chiefs were also the first team in the Western Hockey League to come back from an 0–3 deficit to win a best-of-seven series, which they did against the Portland Winter Hawks in 1996.\n\nThe 1991 Memorial Cup team included future NHL players: Ray Whitney, Pat Falloon, Trevor Kidd, Jon Klemm, and Scott Bailey. This team of future NHLers blew through the Memorial Cup tournament, scoring a goal in the first couple of minutes of most games.\nThe Chiefs' moved to the new Spokane Arena in 1995 and has since hosted many memorable events. In the first year, the Chiefs won 50 games and advanced to the WHL finals, losing in five games to the Brandon Wheat Kings. Two years later, the Chiefs hosted the 1998 Memorial Cup, setting an attendance record at the time. In the 1999–00 season, head coach Mike Babcock led the team from a last place finish the previous year to a first place, 47-win season. The Chiefs advanced to play the Kootenay Ice in the WHL finals, but lost in six games.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2005, the Chiefs struggled, going through three head coaches in five years: Perry Ganchar (resigned), Al Conroy (fired) and Bill Peters. Spokane continued to support the team, consistently averaging 6,000–7,000 fans per game, one of the top figures in the Western and Canadian Hockey Leagues. The Chiefs are also known for a goal celebration often called the 'best in junior hockey.' In 1999, the fans were named the best in the WHL. On Saturday nights, often referred to as 'Hockey Night in Spokane', the Spokane Arena is generally sold out, and sellouts are expected when the Tri-City Americans come to town.\nThe 2007–08 season produced the most wins by a Spokane Chiefs' team since the 1999–00 season, a season which saw the Chiefs go to the WHL Finals. The team, backed by a solid goaltending tandem and an offensive attack led by Carolina Hurricanes' draft pick Drayson Bowman, ranked in the top ten of the CHL for most of the season and reached the #1 spot in late February. In one of the greatest series in WHL history, the Chiefs beat their arch-rival, the Tri-City Americans, four games to three in the Western Conference finals to earn a spot in the 2008 WHL Finals. Five of the seven games went into overtime, including three games decided in double overtime.\n\nIn the Finals, the Chiefs outscored the Lethbridge Hurricanes 15–5 and swept the series 4–0, just as they did in the 1991 WHL playoffs, to earn a trip to the Memorial Cup in Kitchener, Ontario. The Chiefs skated to a perfect 3–0 round-robin record en route to their 2nd Memorial Cup, defeating the host Kitchener Rangers 4–1 in the championship game. The Chiefs remain the only U.S. team ever to win the Memorial Cup on Canadian soil.\n\nThe Chiefs and the Portland Winterhawks made history again in the playoffs in 2010, as Portland beat Spokane in the Western Conference quarterfinals, four games to three. It is the only series in Western Hockey League history in which the home team did not win a game.\n\nOn May 4, 2010, the Chiefs announced Hardy Sauter's contract was not extended, ending his two-year stint as the team's head coach. Weeks later, former Tri-City coach Don Nachbaur unexpectedly resigned from a coaching position in the AHL and was named the new head coach of the Chiefs hours later.\n\nNachbaur's first season as head coach was predicted to finish at or near the bottom of the Western Conference, but the Chiefs finished the season with 102 points, the third highest total in team history, and only one point away from the regular season Western Conference title. Led by Tampa Bay Lightning prospect Tyler Johnson, the Chiefs led the league in goals scored and power play goals. The Chiefs also allowed the second fewest goals in the league, led by Ottawa Senators prospect Jared Cowen. Spokane advanced to the Western Conference finals, only to lose to Portland four games to two. Nachbaur was named WHL Coach of the Year for 2011 becoming the only coach in WHL history to win the honor with three different teams: Spokane, Seattle and Tri-City.\n\nDuring the 2010 offseason, the Chiefs and the Western Hockey League announced the WHL's first outdoor hockey game would be played in Spokane on January 15, 2011, between the Chiefs and the Kootenay Ice. While the game was welcomed with great excitement in Spokane, many fans questioned the location of the 7,000-seat Avista Stadium, the home of the Spokane Indians baseball club. Joe Albi Stadium, a 28,000-seat facility that usually hosts high school and college football, was thought to be a much-better choice. Chiefs' owner Bobby Brett, who also owns the Indians baseball team, said the Chiefs could not reach an agreement with the city on using Joe Albi. \nConstruction crews begin their work at Avista Stadium the week after New Year's. A platform was constructed between first and third base on the baseball field, and then the ice refrigeration unit was placed on top of the platform. It took crews about one week to have the ice rink ready to go.\n\nWeather played a critical role in the lead up to the game and on game day itself. Initial forecasts called for arctic temperatures and more than a foot of snow falling on January 15. That changed the week of the game, when a warm Pacific storm went through the northwest and melted nearly a foot of snow already on the ground in Spokane. The temperatures on game day reached 50-degrees and there was no snow. Moments before the puck dropped, the sky turned cloudy and hid the sun allowing for optimal conditions. In the end, the game was played at Avista Stadium in front of a sell-out crowd of 7,075. While they enjoyed the experience, many fans complained about the view from their seats at Avista Stadium. Fans who bought front-row tickets discovered they were eye-level with the side boards, making only the upper-part of the players' bodies visible and making it impossible to see the puck.\n\nThe Chiefs won the game 11–2 over Kootenay, as nine different players scored for Spokane. Brett and the Chiefs organization have said it is very unlikely an outdoor game would ever be played in Spokane again, although the following day general manager Tim Speltz did leave open the possibility of hosting a game at Joe Albi Stadium.\n\n<section begin=roster />\n\nMost goals: 68 - Valeri Bure (1992–93)\n\nMost career goals: 147 - Mitch Holmberg (2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2012-13, 2013-14)\n\nMost assists: 118 - Ray Whitney (1990–91)\n\nMost points: 185 - Ray Whitney (1990–91)\n\nMost points, rookie: 78 - Pat Falloon (1988–89)\n\nMost points, defenceman: 85 - Brenden Kichton (2012–13)\n\nMost penalty minutes: 505 - Kerry Toporowski (1990–91)\n\nBest goals against average, goaltender: 1.97 - Dustin Tokarski (2008–09)\n\nMost shutouts, goaltender: 15 - Dustin Tokarski (2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09)\n\nMost saves, goaltender: 2,007 - Troy Gamble (1987–88)\n\nMost regular season wins, goaltender: 85 - James Reid (2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11)\n\nMost single-season games played, goaltender: 67 - Troy Gamble (1987–88)\n\nMost points in standings, team: 107 (2007–08)\n\nMost wins, team: 50 (1995–96), (2007–08)\n\nLongest game: 2:26:05 - 4 OT's (vs. Vancouver - April 10, 2009) (2nd longest game in WHL history)\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties OTL = Overtime losses Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpokane Chiefs games are broadcast on AM 1510 KGA throughout Eastern Washington, Northern Idaho and parts of British Columbia.

The Priestly authors of Genesis 1, writing around 500–400 BCE, had been concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with the fixing of destinies. This was still the situation in the early 2nd century CE, although early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God, but by the beginning of the 3rd century this tension was resolved, world-formation was overcome, and creation \"ex nihilo\" had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1922144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922144", "title": "Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)", "text": "Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)\n\nFairfax High School (officially Fairfax Senior High School) is a Los Angeles Unified School District high school located in Los Angeles, California, near the border of West Hollywood in the Fairfax District. The school is located on a campus at the intersection of Fairfax Avenue and trendy Melrose Avenue.\n\nSeveral sections of Los Angeles, including the Fairfax District, Park La Brea, portions of Hancock Park, and Larchmont, and the city of West Hollywood are served by Fairfax. Some areas (including parts of West Hollywood) are jointly zoned to Fairfax High School and Hollywood High School. In fall 2007, some neighborhoods zoned to Hamilton High School were rezoned to Fairfax High School. Bancroft Middle School, Emerson Middle School, Le Conte Middle School, and John Burroughs Middle School feed into Fairfax. In 2009 some territory from the Los Angeles High School attendance boundary was transferred to Fairfax High School.\n\nFairfax High School was founded in 1924 under the direction of Principal Rae G. Van Cleve, for whom the athletic field is named. The original Spanish Colonial Revival main building did not meet earthquake safety standards, and most of the original campus facilities were demolished in 1966. However, the historic D. S. Swan Auditorium and iconic Rotunda were spared by preservationists and retrofitted. The theater was renovated in 2014. Greenway Court, originally built in 1939 as a social hall by the students at Fairfax as a class project, was also spared and was moved to its current location on Fairfax Avenue, where it was converted into a theater in 1999 by the Greenway Arts Alliance and renamed the Greenway Court Theater.\n\nIn previous eras, the school had a reputation for academic excellence and it had a majority Jewish student body.\n\nFormer NFL official Jim Tunney served as the school's principal from 1964 to 1970. Under his watch, most of the current campus facilities, except for those mentioned above, were built between 1966 and 1968, including the gymnasium.\n\nWhen the 1971 San Fernando earthquake struck with a moment magnitude of 6.5–6.7, nearby Los Angeles High School was damaged severely and closed for repairs. Students from Los Angeles High attended Fairfax High on \"double sessions,\" with Fairfax students using the campus from 7 am – 12 noon, and LA High students from 12:30 pm – 5 pm.\n\nFairfax was the foreign language magnet school in the 1960s and 1970s, offering Hebrew, German, Chinese and Latin, among other languages. The Fairfax Magnet Center for Visual Arts opened in 1981 and remains the only visual arts magnet in the Los Angeles Unified School District.\n\nIn 1984, Dr. Virginia Uribe, an LAUSD teacher and counselor for 42 years, founded LAUSD's Project 10 program, the first dropout prevention program specifically for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) students in the United States.\n\nBy the 1980s, the proliferation of magnet schools caused an exodus of many White students and several of the school's best teachers. By that time the test scores declined and many school clubs and activities ceased operations.\n\nOrganized by a group of local theater artists, the first Melrose Trading Post was held in 1996 in the school's parking lot. Regarded as most successful on-going fund-raising activity in the LAUSD, the flea market evolved into the Greenway Arts Alliance, the Friends of Fairfax and the Institute for the Arts at Fairfax High School, all which are of immense benefit to the school and students.\n\nAs of the 2015–2016 school year, there were 2,108 students enrolled in Fairfax High School.\n\nThe racial/ethnic composition (as of the 2015–2016 school year) was as follows:\n\nAccording to \"US News and World Report\", 92% of Fairfax's student body is \"of color,\" with 79% of the student body coming from economically disadvantaged households, determined by student eligibility for California's Reduced-price meal program.\n\nIn the 1950s, Fairfax High School was known for having a large Jewish student body, as a Jewish community surrounded the school. It became known as a \"Jewish\" high school, and some non-Jewish parents withdrew their children from Fairfax as they felt discomfort with the Jewish character of the school. In 1953, Fairfax High introduced Modern Hebrew classes, initially taught by the principal of the Beverly-Fairfax Jewish Community Center, Ronnie Tofield.\n\nThe racial composition became significantly more multi-cultural following the integration efforts of 1968. As Fairfax principal William Layne told the Los Angeles Times in 1975, “Fairfax began changing in 1968. Then the boundaries were adjusted to include an area past Pico. It caused a trauma to what had been an all-white, academic school. There was strong reaction from the community as well. The senior citizens got upset when they saw a kid they couldn’t identify with. There was also unrest at school, fearfulness, and an increase in thefts, people being molested.\"\n\nEventually, racial tensions subsided as the school worked toward an active integration plan led by Layne.\n\nThe table below represents the number of enrolled students at Fairfax High School through 2003–2007.\n\nSource:\n\nFairfax High School re-opened in Fall 2008 reconfigured into a complex consisting of the existing Fairfax Magnet Center for Visual Arts and five new small learning communities (SLCs). The campus was divided into six areas of \"contiguous space.\" Non-magnet students and staff were reorganized into five new schools-within-a-school. Subsequently, in 2010, two of the SLCs were replaced by a single SLC, bringing the total down to four SLCs and the Magnet. Currently, these SLCs are:\n\nFairfax is home to the Fairfax Magnet Center for Visual Arts, which attracts students from across the of the district. It opened in 1981 and is the only visual arts magnet in Los Angeles Unified School District.\n\nFairfax High School is home to the Greenway Arts Alliance, which operates the Greenway Court Theater, a 99-seat Equity-waiver playhouse, and through the Institute for the Arts at Greenway, provides arts educational programs, mentoring, and employment opportunities to Fairfax students.\n\nSince 1997, the Melrose Trading Post outdoor flea market has created opportunities for Fairfax High School and the surrounding neighborhood. Money raised by this nonprofit organization from the low-cost patron admission and vendor booth fees fuels an arts education program on the FHS campus called, Institute for the Arts at Greenway.\n\n"}

Robert James' son, Tom James, joined in 1966 and assumed leadership of the firm in 1970. The firm planned to go public in 1969, but market conditions delayed its plan until 1983. Tom turned over the CEO's post to Paul Reilly in 2010, and his title as Chairman of the Board to Paul Reilly in 2016. He remains on the leadership team as Chairman Emeritus.\n\nIn 2012, the firm purchased the Canadian assets of Allied Irish Bank. In April 2012, they merged with Morgan Keegan & Company, creating one of the country's largest full-service wealth management and investment banking firms not headquartered in New York.\n\nAs of the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2018, the firm had delivered 123 consecutive quarters of profitability. In June 2016, it was listed as a Fortune 500 company for the first time.\n\nIn September 2016, the firm announced its acquisition of Deutsche Bank Wealth Management's US private client services unit, Alex Brown & Sons.\n\nAs of October 2019, Raymond James has 8,000 financial advisors throughout the United States, Canada and overseas. Total client assets under management are approximately $838 billion. The corporate headquarters is located in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nRaymond James has four main lines of operation: private client group, capital markets (made up of equity and fixed income capital markets as well as public finance), asset management group (made up of asset management services and Carillon tower advisers) and banking.\n\nIn 2004, the SEC fined Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. $6.9 million for failure to supervise former broker Dennis Herula. Herula was accused of participating with others in a Ponzi scheme that raised about $44.5 million from investors in 1999-2000. Herula himself raised about $16.5 million of investor funds, most of which was later transferred to his wife's brokerage account at Raymond James. He was arrested in Bermuda and pleaded guilty to criminal charges of wire fraud and sentenced to 188 months in jail.\n\nIn 2005, the National Association of Securities Dealers fined Raymond James $2.75 million for lax supervision of producing branch managers. The investigation began with one Raymond James manager, who worked from an office in her Wisconsin home, handling approximately 700 accounts and selling mainly mutual funds and variable annuities. The Wisconsin manager was accused of selling unsuitable aggressive mutual funds and variable annuities over a four-year period.\n\nOn June 29, 2011, Raymond James announced an agreement to repurchase at par auction rate securities (ARS) sold to clients through its domestic broker/dealer subsidiaries prior to February 13, 2008. The agreement—reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with state securities regulators led by Florida and Texas—resolved more than three years of investigation related to activity in the ARS market. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the firm also agreed to pay a fine totaling $1.75 million to the state regulators, but was not fined by the SEC.\n\nAs a result of this agreement, a pre-tax charge of $45 million was recorded in the quarter ending June 30, 2011. This charge was a result of an estimate of the current fair value of the securities to be repurchased by the company being less than their par value. It is expected that the ultimate realized loss will be substantially less as issuers refinance or redeem these securities, interest rates rise and/or collateral values improve.\n\nRaymond James sold $2.3 billion worth of ARS, underwrote $1.2 billion, and was the auction dealer for over $725 million. Since the $330 billion market for ARS crashed in 2008, at least 19 underwriters and broker-dealers were sued in class action suits.\n\nIn September 2011, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ordered Raymond James & Associates, Inc. and Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. to pay restitution of $1.69 million to 15,500 of their clients for charging excessive commissions on more than 27,000 securities transactions. The trades were made in client accounts between 2006 and 2010.\n\nFINRA also fined RJA $225,000 and RJFS $200,000.\n\nOn May 18, 2016 Raymond James was fined $17 Million for Systemic Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Failures. \"RJA was fined $8 million and RJFS was fined $9 million for failing to establish and implement adequate AML procedures, which resulted in the firms’ failure to properly prevent or detect, investigate, and report suspicious activity for several years. RJA's former AML Compliance Officer, Linda L. Busby, was also fined $25,000 and suspended for three months.\". On December 21, 2017 Raymond James was fined $2 million for failing to reasonably supervise email communications. \"FINRA found that during a nine-year review period, Raymond James’ email review system was flawed in significant respects, allowing millions of emails to evade meaningful review. This created the unreasonable risk that certain misconduct by firm personnel could go undetected by the firm. The combinations of words and phrases – otherwise known as the “lexicon” – used to flag emails for review were not reasonably designed to detect certain potential misconduct that Raymond James, in light of its size, structure, business model, and experience from prior disciplinary actions, knew or should have anticipated would recur from time to time. The firm also failed to devote adequate personnel and resources to the team that reviewed emails flagged by the system, even as the number of emails increased over time.\"\n\nRaymond James Stadium, a multi-purpose stadium in Tampa, Florida\n"}

It serves the MBTA's Blue Line and is located at Maverick Square in East Boston. It is the easternmost underground station on the Blue Line and a transfer point to various buses. A center island platform provides access to the surface in the middle of Maverick Square. In the station, a track map lined with light bulbs shows the position of the trains on the Blue Line between Bowdoin and Orient Heights. It was one of the last stations to be converted to 6-car train service as part of the MBTA's Blue Line Renovation Project.\n\nWhen the East Boston Tunnel originally opened on December 30, 1904, it was a streetcar tunnel with a portal at Maverick, known as Maverick Portal or the Maverick Incline. There was no station at Maverick; streetcars simply left the portal and continued north on Meridian Street or southeast on Maverick Street.\n\nOn April 18-21, 1924, the tunnel was converted to rapid transit and Maverick station opened, with the streetcar loop between the rapid transit platforms. The last streetcar lines to use the underground loop were the , , , , and ; these last ran January 4, 1952, the day before the Revere Extension to the rapid transit line opened. The streetcar loop and portal have since been closed, with parts of the incline now used for pedestrian access. The station has an extra-wide platform as a result of filling in the former streetcar tracks. The abandoned streetcar loop west of the station remains extant.\n\nThe MBTA began design work of a renovation of the station in 1998. A $30.8 million construction contract, which also included ventilation work in the East Boston Tunnel, was awarded on May 5, 2005. Construction began on October 4, 2005. The work included extension of the platforms for six-car trains, replacement of the Maverick Square headhouse, addition of a new headhouse on Lewis Mall, and the creation of a dedicated busway in Maverick Square. Both headhouses included two elevators to make the station fully accessible. The Lewis Mall headhouse opened on September 22, 2007, allowing the old Maverick Square headhouse to be demolished that November. The renovation was completed in 2009. The final cost was $56.3 million, which included $12.4 million in change orders - of which $8.9 million was due to design errors by the MBTA.\n\nThe station is a terminal for five MBTA Bus local routes:\n\n"}

It is home to the Spokane Shock of the Indoor Football League and the Spokane Chiefs of the Western Hockey League.\n\nWith an aging Spokane Coliseum, along with a need for a larger facility more than twice the coliseum's capacity, the Spokane City Council and Board of Spokane County Commissioners formed the Spokane Public Facilities District (SPFD) to acquire, construct, own and operate sports and entertainment facilities with contiguous parking facilities. In 1990, the SPFD board members unanimously agreed on the following recommendations made by an economic feasibility/market study. The recommendations were:\n\nVoters rejected the Spokane Arena four times in six years before agreeing to build it in 1991.\n\nIn the fall of that year, two ballot measures were put out to voters, and passed:\nIn the fall of 1991, another funding measure was put out to voters and was passed. It involved a 0.1% raise in the sales tax. The passage of all three measures completed the $44.8 million financining needed to build the arena.\n\nGround was broken on March 5, 1993, and the Spokane Arena opened 2 years later, in September 1995.\n\nThe Spokane Arena has a capacity for:\n\nThe arena has a state-of-the-art audio and video system. It consists of a Viacom Sports 12 mm LED display, which is capable of being used as two separate units. The video board has exceptional color reproduction and the best off-angle viewing available for any LED format. It can even be moved forward approximately and down to approximately off the arena floor. The arena also features a 350° color LED ribbon board, which is mounted on the fascia of the Spokane Arena bowl. It is capable of displaying text messages, animations, logos, scores and statistics.\n\nPowered by Crown Amplifiers, the audio system is driven by Community RS880 speakers in the Arena bowl, Altec Lansing satellite speakers for the upper seating areas, and Bose speakers serve the concourse, dressing rooms, and backstage hallways.\n\nLarge public areas are one of the greater features of the Spokane Arena. The arena floor is , and the high concourse is a spacious . 16 luxury suites contain a total of 146 seats. In addition, there are six meeting rooms located at the Spokane Arena, totalling of meeting space.\n\nOn the Events Level, there are five truck docks with x loading doors, one x drive-in door, and one x drive-in loading door, allowing large shows to load and unload eight trucks simultaneously. Trucks can load and unload unobstructed, directly into the marshalling area at the arena floor's west end. Backstage are three star dressing rooms, two promoter offices (located in the marshalling area), and seven team dressing rooms, as well as a dressing room for officials.\n\nThe elevation at street level is approximately above sea level.\n\nIncorporated into its original design was an area designated for future expansion of the arena. Expansion of the upper bowl would raise the seating capacity of the arena to over 15,000. In 2011, the Spokane Public Facilities District became concerned the NCAA may tighten its criteria and require a true minimum of 12,000, with no allowance for seats lost due to tournament infrastructure. In early 2012, the Spokane Public Facilities District had \"Measure 1\" put on the April ballot, which was proposing to extend 0.1% sales tax and a 2% room tax to pay for a 91,000-square-foot addition to the Convention Center and other projects, including adding 750 seats to the Arena.\n\nMeasure 1 was voted yes, and the 750 seats will eventually be added to the Arena. However, the seats that are to be added may have sight obstruction to the video wall, as it would be on the same side facing away. After this phase of new seating, full expansion of the arena including a center hung scoreboard and full seating expansion will cost roughly $3.547 million.\n\nIt is unknown as to whether the PFD will max out the arena's capacity.\n\nSpokane Arena, in addition to its duties as being the host of Chiefs and Shock games, also has served as a secondary home for the men's basketball programs of Gonzaga University and Washington State University for nearly every year since opened. Washington State has played 33 matchups in the Spokane Arena in 19 of the 22 years with a record of 18–15 (1–7 vs. ranked opponents), while Gonzaga has hosted 18 games in 15 of the 22 years with a record of 12–6 (1–2 vs. ranked opposition). In-state rivals Washington State and Gonzaga have faced off against each other in the arena on five occasions (1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2014) with the Zags owning a 3–2 record against the Cougars in those games. The Bulldogs' faced off against local rival Eastern Washington University at the arena in four consecutive years (2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005), each won by the Zags, but just like with the Cougars, the rivalry has gone dormant due to the rise of the Zags' program to major status since the late 1990s, while the Cougars and Eagles have not seen much national spotlight. Washington State has often hosted home games at the Spokane Arena as a part of its Pac-12 Conference men's basketball schedule, holding a 7–9 against conference foes in the arena, facing UCLA (1996 and 2004), Oregon (1997 and 2011), Oregon State (1997, 2011, and 2017), Arizona (1998, 2001, and 2006), Washington (1999), USC (2000 and 2004), Stanford (2004), California (2005), and Colorado (2014). With Gonzaga's rise to prominence, the Zags were able to bring high major schools like Washington (1998), Georgia (2003), Memphis (2007, 2009, and 2011) and Oklahoma (2009) to the Spokane Arena, with the Gonzaga holding a 2–3 record in those matchups, but with conference realignment and the West Coast Conference's additions of BYU (2011) and Pacific (2013), the Zags have been more selective and limited in their scheduling with four less matchups in their non-conference schedule, so they have only played in the Spokane Arena once since 2012.\n\nIt also hosted the WIAA Class B state high school basketball tournament annually until 2006. The tournament came back to the arena in 2007, but as the Class 2B tournament. The WIAA had split the B classification into 1B and 2B. The Yakima SunDome in Yakima hosts the 1B tournament. The Class 1B tournament returned in 2011 when the WIAA changed the state tournament format.\n\nNotably, this was the reason why the West Coast Conference Men's Basketball Tournament had never been in Spokane before 2006; the Class B and WCC tournaments clash every year, and Gonzaga's on-campus arena at that time, the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, was too small to host the WCC tournament (it seated only 4,000 people). In 2004, Gonzaga opened a new on-campus arena, the McCarthey Athletic Center, which enabled it to enter the WCC tournament rotation. The conference has since moved its tournament to the neutral Orleans Arena in Las Vegas.\n\nSpokane Arena has been the site of several NCAA Division I basketball tournament games (men and women), with Washington State University as the designated host school. For the men, the arena hosted in the opening rounds in 2003, 2007, 2010, 2014, and 2016, hosted by the University of Idaho for the first time. Prior to the arena's opening, the NCAA tournament was held in the region on the WSU campus in Pullman at Beasley Coliseum (1975, 1982, 1984).\n\nThe arena was a women's regional site in 2008, 2011, and 2015. The 2011 regional was notable as Gonzaga became the lowest-seeded team ever to make a regional final in the women's tournament.\n\nIn 1999, the PBR made a stop in Spokane Arena for a Bud Light Cup Series event; it was one of six wins for Cody Hart in 1999, the same year he became a PBR World Champion.\n\nIn January 2007, the Spokane Arena was put in the national spotlight once again. It was one of two facilities to host the 2007 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, the other being the Group Health Exhibit Hall at the Spokane Center several blocks away. The arena, as well as the city received many rave reviews and also shattered the previous attendance record for the event, previously held by Los Angeles, California, by over 30,000 attendees.\n\nOn May 5, 2008, it was announced that Spokane would once again host the U.S. Figure Skating Championships leading up to the 2010 Winter Olympics. Spokane Arena was the sole venue for the 2010 U.S. Figure Skating Championships.\n\nThe Spokane Arena successfully hosted the 2010 US Figure Skating Championships from January 15–24, 2010 and broke its own attendance record with 158,170 tickets sold during the 10-day event.\n\nAlso, the Spokane Arena hosted the very first 2016 Team Challenge Cup, where athletes from North America, Europe, and Asia, competed against each other in teams. Team North America won the event.\n\nThe Spokane Shock of the af2 and the Arena Football League played at the arena from 2006 until 2015. The Shock hosted ArenaBowl XXIII in 2010. The Shock then attempted to join the Indoor Football League in 2015 but the AFL withheld the franchise rights from the ownership. The owners then created the Spokane Empire and played in the IFL in 2016 and 2017 before ceasing operations.\n\nThe Spokane Chiefs of the WHL play their home games at the arena.\n\nThe Star Theatre is a 5,900-seat theater configuration used for theater concerts, Broadway, family shows and other events. The seating capacity of the configuration positions the \"venue\" between the seating capacities of the nearby First Interstate Center for the Arts and the full-theater seating configuration of the Spokane Arena.\n\nNumerous other activities have taken place at the Spokane Arena including circuses, large conferences, monster truck shows, concerts and much more. And every year the arena is home to Spokane's band and strings spectacular featuring the areas band and strings groups grades 5-6 from all schools.\n\nOver the years the venue has hosted a variety of professional wrestling shows.\n\nTournament\n\n"}

It grows rapidly, but has a short lifespan, between 40 and 75 years. The shoots are yellowish-brown, with small buds. The leaves are alternate and spirally arranged, narrow, light green, 4–16 cm long and 0.5–2 cm broad, with finely serrate margins and long acuminate tips; they turn a gold-yellow in autumn. The flowers are arranged in catkins produced early in the spring; it is dioecious, with the male and female catkins on separate trees.\n\"Salix babylonica\" was described and named scientifically by Carolus Linnaeus in 1736, who knew the species as the pendulous-branched (\"weeping\") variant then recently introduced into the Clifford garden in Hartekamp in The Netherlands.\n\nEarly Chinese cultivar selections include the original weeping willow, \"Salix babylonica\" 'Pendula', in which the branches and twigs are strongly pendulous, which was presumably spread along ancient trade routes. These distinctive trees were subsequently introduced into England from Aleppo in northern Syria in 1730, and have rapidly become naturalised, growing well along rivers and in parks. These plants are all females, readily propagated vegetatively, and capable of hybridizing with various other kinds of willows, but not breeding true from seed. This type of tree is grown very easily through plant propagation.\n\nTwo cultivated hybrids between pendulous \"Salix babylonica\" and other species of \"Salix\" willows also have pendulous branchlets, and are more commonly planted than \"S. babylonica\" itself:\n\n\nCultivars derived from either of these hybrids are generally better adapted than \"S. babylonica\" to the more humid climates of most heavily populated regions of Europe and North America.\n\nA similar willow species also native to northern China, \"Salix matsudana\" (Chinese willow), is now included in \"Salix babylonica\" as a synonym by many botanists, including the Russian willow expert Alexey Skvortsov. The only reported difference between the two species is \"S. matsudana\" has two nectaries in each female flower, whereas \"S. babylonica\" has only one; however, this character is variable in many willows (for example, crack willow, \"Salix fragilis\", can have either one or two), so even this difference may not be taxonomically significant.\n\n\"S. babylonica,\" especially its pendulous-branched (\"weeping\") form, has been introduced into many other areas, including Europe and the southeastern United States, but beyond China, it has not generally been as successfully cultivated as some of its hybrid derivatives, being sensitive to late-spring frosts. In the more humid climates of much of Europe and eastern North America, it is susceptible to a canker disease, willow anthracnose (\"Marssonina salicicola\"), which makes infected trees very short-lived and unsightly.\n\n\"Salix babylonica\" (Babylon willow) has many cultivars, including:\n\nVarious cultivars of \"Salix matsudana\" (Chinese willow) are now often included within \"Salix babylonica\", treated more broadly, including:\n\nYet other weeping willow cultivars are derived from interspecific \"Salix\" hybrids, including \"S. babylonica\" in their parentage. The most widely grown weeping willow cultivar is \"Salix × sepulcralis\" 'Chrysocoma', with bright yellowish branchlets.\n\nPeking willow is a popular ornamental tree in northern China, and is also grown for wood production and shelterbelts there, being particularly important around the oases of the Gobi Desert, protecting agricultural land from desert winds.\n\nThe epithet \"babylonica\" in this Chinese species' scientific name \"(S. babylonica),\" as well as the related common names \"Babylon willow\" or \"Babylon weeping willow\", derive from a misunderstanding by Linnaeus that this willow was the tree described in the \"Bible\" in the opening of Psalm 137 (here in Latin and English translations):\n\n\n\nDespite these Biblical references to \"willows\", whether in Latin or English, the trees growing in Babylon along the Euphrates River in ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) and named \"gharab\" in early Hebrew, are not willows (\"Salix\") in either the modern or the classical sense, but the Euphrates poplar \"(Populus euphratica),\" with willow-like leaves on long, drooping shoots, in the related genus \"Populus.\" Both \"Populus\" and \"Salix\" are in the plant family Salicaceae, the willow family.\n\nThese Babylonian trees are correctly called poplars, not willows, in the New International Version of the \"Bible\" (English, 1978):\n\n"}

They crashed out of the tournament in fourth place after losing consecutive games to the Vancouver Giants, Plymouth Whalers, and the Whalers again in the tie-breaker, scoring only three goals in three games in the process.\n\n\nOn January 25, 2009, it was announced that the MAINEiacs were negotiating with the city of Boisbriand, Quebec (a suburb of Montreal), in hopes of relocating the franchise for the 2009–10 season. Under the plan, Mark Just would remain majority owner with 51% of the shares, with former NHL defenseman Joel Bouchard owning the rest. On January 31, the team announced that they had filed their intent to relocate, and had submitted papers to do so to the QMJHL.\n\nIn a January 31 media release announcing the move of the MAINEiacs franchise, owner Mark Just said that community support for the team was a major consideration. During the six seasons since the team moved from Sherbrooke, Quebec, to Lewiston, the MAINEiacs never managed to break even. However, on February 2, Farrel Miller, owner of the QMJHL's Montreal Junior Hockey Club, issued a statement that his team would fight the MAINEiacs move to Boisbriand on territorial grounds.\n\nAfter several weeks of negotiations with a number of Canadian cities (most notably Fredericton, New Brunswick), MAINEiacs Head Coach Don Macadam announced on March 24, 2009, that the MAINEiacs would be remaining in Lewiston. In June 2010, Lewiston businessman Paul Spellman became minority owner of the team, and in early August 2010, former Moncton Wildcats General Manager Bill Schurman was named as the team's Sports Management Consultant. However, relocation rumors continued to follow the team, with Summerside, Prince Edward Island (where Schurman, a native of that town, had recently been the municipality's Director of Community Services), and St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, named as a potential destinations in January 2011.\n\nSchurman's denials of the team looking into a Summerside relocation proved unconvincing, and the rumours had a negative effect on attendance. However, Schurman's dream of moving the MAINEiacs to his home city ultimately failed, as a preliminary exploration to gauge support for a move to Summerside found little traction. The team then began to look at other possibilities, but found that few other relocation options existed.\n\nThe Lewiston franchise was disbanded by the QMJHL in the summer of 2011. To replace the defunct MAINEiacs club, the Sherbrooke Phoenix is scheduled to begin play for the 2012–13 season. It will be the 3rd franchise to call Sherbrooke home in the last 25 years.\n\nOn May 31, 2011, the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League held a conference call to prepare an offer to purchase the team from Mark Just for 3.5 million dollars. Under the league's plan, the MAINEiacs would then be disbanded, with players being selected by other clubs in a dispersal draft. Late on May 31, the league issued a press release confirming the sale of the MAINEiacs to the league, and the subsequent disbanding / dispersal draft occurred the following week. Colisee stated they would search for a replacement team from outside of the QMJHL to take the MAINEiacs place.\n\nThe City of Lewiston and the Androscoggin Bank Colisee would end up getting the American Hockey League's Portland Pirates to move to the Colisee for the 2013-14 season after disputing their lease with the Cumberland County Civic Center in Portland. Starting in 2019, the NAHL Maine Nordiques (junior hockey) and their partner organization, the NA3HL Lewiston-Auburn Nordiques, began play at the Colisee.\n\n\n\n\n\nNine MAINEiacs to date have played in the NHL:\n\nIn addition, the MAINEiacs have had several players drafted by National Hockey League teams.

He is best known, outside blues circles, for his songs \"That's All Right\" (1946), \"My Baby Left Me\" and \"So Glad You're Mine\", later recorded by Elvis Presley and other artists.\n\nCrudup was born in Forest, Mississippi, to a family of migrant workers traveling through the South and Midwest. The family returned to Mississippi in 1926, where he sang gospel music. He had lessons with a local bluesman, whose name was Papa Harvey, and later he was able to play in dance halls and cafes around Forest. Around 1940 he went to Chicago.\n\nHe began his career as a blues singer around Clarksdale, Mississippi. As a member of the Harmonizing Four, he visited Chicago in 1939. He stayed in Chicago to work as a solo musician but barely made a living as a street singer. The record producer Lester Melrose allegedly found him while Crudup was living in a packing crate, introduced him to Tampa Red and signed him to a recording contract with RCA Victor's Bluebird label.\n\nHe recorded with RCA in the late 1940s and with Ace Records, Checker Records and Trumpet Records in the early 1950s. He toured black clubs in the South, sometimes playing with Sonny Boy Williamson II and Elmore James. He also recorded under the names \"Elmer James\" and \"Percy Lee Crudup\". His songs \"Mean Old 'Frisco Blues\", \"Who's Been Foolin' You\" and \"That's All Right\" were popular in the South. These and his other songs \"Rock Me Mama\", \"So Glad You're Mine\", and \"My Baby Left Me\" have been recorded by many artists, including Elvis Presley, Slade, Elton John and Rod Stewart.\n\nCrudup stopped recording in the 1950s because of disputes over royalties. He said, \"\"I realised I was making everybody rich, and here I was poor\"\". His last Chicago session was in 1951. His 1952–54 recording sessions for Victor were held at radio station WGST, in Atlanta, Georgia. He returned to recording, for Fire Records and Delmark Records, and touring in 1965. Sometimes labeled \"The Father of Rock and Roll\", he accepted this title with some bemusement. During this time Crudup worked as a laborer to augment the low wages he received as a singer (he was not receiving royalties). After a dispute with Melrose over royalties, he returned to Mississippi and took up bootlegging. He later moved to Virginia, where he lived with his family, including three sons and several of his siblings, and worked as a field laborer. He occasionally sang in and supplied moonshine to drinking establishments, including one called the Do Drop Inn, in Franktown, Northampton County.\n\nIn 1968, the blues promoter Dick Waterman began fighting for Crudup's royalties and reached an agreement in which Crudup would be paid $60,000. However, Hill and Range Songs, from which he was supposed to get the royalties, refused to sign the legal papers at the last minute, because the company thought it could not lose more money in legal action. In the early 1970s, two Virginia activists, Celia Santiago and Margaret Carter, assisted Crudup in an attempt to gain royalties he felt he was due, with little success. By 1971, he had collected over $10,000 in overdue royalties through the intervention of the Songwriters Guild of America (then called the American Guild Of Authors And Composers).\n\nOn a 1970 trip to the United Kingdom, Crudup recorded \"Roebuck Man\" with local musicians. His last professional engagements were with Bonnie Raitt.\n\nCrudup died in 1974, four years after the failed royalty settlement. There was some confusion about the date of death because of his use of several names, including those of his siblings. He died of complications of heart disease and diabetes in the Nassawadox hospital in Northampton County, Virginia, in March 1974.\n\nCrudup has been honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail, placed at Forest. Elvis Presley acknowledged Crudup's importance to rock and roll when he said, \"If I had any ambition, it was to be as good as Arthur Crudup\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1922265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922265", "title": "Princely Abbey of Corvey", "text": "Princely Abbey of Corvey\n\nThe Princely Abbey of Corvey () is a former Benedictine abbey and ecclesiastical principality now in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It was one of the half-dozen self-ruling \"princely abbeys\" of the Holy Roman Empire from the late Middle Ages until 1792 when Corvey was elevated to a prince-bishopric. Corvey, whose territory extended over a vast area, was in turn secularized in 1803 in the course of the German mediatisation and absorbed into the newly created Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda. In 2014, the former abbey church was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nIn the Saxon Wars which lasted more than thirty years after 772, Charlemagne, king of the Franks, was eventually victorious, adding the Saxon territory to his empire and starting the Christianisation of the Saxon people. To that end, bishoprics were established (at Hildesheim and Halberstadt). In addition, the idea of setting up an abbey in Saxony was first mooted during Charlemagne's reign. However, the plan was only implemented under his son, Emperor Louis the Pious, who announced the creation of an abbey east of the river Weser at a synod in Paderborn in 815. This was located at a place named \"Hethis\". Although there is some uncertainty over the exact location, it is today thought to be near . The first monks arrived in 816 from the Benedictine abbey from Corbie Abbey in Picardy. They set up a \"Probstei\", a subsidiary of the motherhouse. Due to the inappropriate location chosen, the monks chose to move in 822 - to the current location near what was then called \"Villa Huxori\". The new house became known as \"Nova Corbeia\" (Latin for the \"new Corbie\"; Old German: \"Corvey\" ).\n\nThe first abbot of Corvey was a cousin of Charlemagne, Adalard of Corbie. Ansgar, who later became the \"Apostle of Scandinavia\", founded the abbey school in 823. The abbey library was established with works from Corbie, augmented by the output of the local scriptorium. In 826, Corvey became an independent abbey, dedicated to Saint Stephen. In 833, it was granted the right of coinage within the Franconian realm, as the first place east of the Rhine.\n\nIn 836, the remains of Saint Vitus were gifted to Corvey by the abbey of St Denis near Paris. Saint Vitus now became the patron saint of the Saxons. Since he was also one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, his veneration was very popular in the Middle Ages and Corvey became a destination for pilgrims. Other gifts and donations by individuals made Corvey one of the richest abbeys in Central Europe and made possible ambitious building projects. Its position as \"Reichsabtei\" meant that its abbot was answerable directly to the emperor in secular matters.\n\nThe first stone church was consecrated in 844. In 873-885, the \"Westwerk\" that is still extant today was constructed.\n\nCorvey thus became \"one of the most privileged Carolingian monastic sanctuaries in the 9th-century Duchy of Saxony\". It soon became famous for its school, which produced many celebrated scholars, among them the 10th-century Saxon historian Widukind of Corvey, author of \"Res gestae Saxonicae\". From its cloisters went forth a stream of missionaries who evangelised Northern Europe.\n\nThe site of the abbey, where the east-west route called the \"Hellweg\" crossed the Weser, was of some strategic importance and assured its economic and cultural importance. The abbey's historian H. H. Kaminsky estimates that the royal entourage visited Corvey at least 110 times before 1073, occasions for the issuance of charters.\n\nA diploma granted by Otto I in 940, the first of its kind, established the abbot, Folcmar, on a new kind of setting. The abbot was granted \"bannus\"—powers of enforcement—over the population of peasants that were to seek refuge in the fortress built in the monastery's lands; in return they were expected to maintain its structure, under the abbot's supervision. The workforce under monastic protection was drawn from three \"pagi\", under the jurisdiction of four counts, who, however, were to have no rights to demand castlework from them.\n\nIn the Investiture Controversy, the abbot of Corvey took a stand with the Saxon nobles against Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Its abbot Markward (served 1081–1107), \"without doubt one of the most important abbots of the thousand-year history of the abbey\" (Kaminsky), and his successor Erkenbert (1107–28) saw the abbey through the critical period.\n\nThe abbey also participated in attempts to reform the Catholic Church during the 11th century. It was the dominant theological centre in the region and established numerous subsidiary abbeys.\n\nA final period of prosperity followed under the leadership of Wibald (abbot from 1146–58). At that time, the \"Westwerk\" was reconstructed in the High Romanesque style, and the Carolingian three-tower set-up was replaced with twin towers. By the mid-12th century, a substantial town (also named Corvey) had grown up around the abbey.\n\nIn 1265, the neighbouring town of Höxter, jealous of its nearby rival and its Weser bridge, allied itself with the Bishop of Paderborn and their troops destroyed the town of Corvey and damaged the abbey. The town never recovered and over the following decades reverted to a small village. This event marked the beginning of the long period of decline of the abbey.\n\nThe Reformation threatened Corvey as it did the other ecclesiastical territories in north-west Germany but the princely abbey did survive somewhat precariously as a self-ruling principality at the border of Protestant Brunswick and Hesse-Kassel. From the mid-16th century onward, the prince-abbot and his monks ran the administration in cooperation with a partly Protestant assembly consisting of three noble families, one town (Höxter) and a prelate. The prince-abbot, who had seat and vote in the \"Reichstag\" as a member of the College of Ruling Princes, took only a modest part in imperial affairs, while the home affairs of the abbey were limited to little more than gentry-like estate management.\n\nIn 1634, during the Thirty Years War the abbey building was sacked by imperial troops who also laid siege to Höxter. It was later demolished. Only the \"Westwerk\" remained.\n\nIt took decades for the local area to recover from the devastation of the war. After Christoph Bernhard von Galen, Bishop of Münster became prince and administrator of the abbey in 1665, reconstruction began. The Carolingian church was replaced by a Gothic building, with the exception of the \"Westwerk\". Under von Galen's successors Christoph von Bellinghausen (1678–96), Florenz von der Felde (1696-1714) and Maximilian von Horrich (1714–22) the other substantial Baroque buildings still there today were erected.\n\nIn 1792, Corvey ceased to be a Benedictine abbey and was raised by pope Pius VI to the status of a prince-bishopric. (abbot/bishop 1776-94) and (bishop 1794-1825) were the last ecclesial princes at Corvey.\n\nIn 1803, the Prince-Bishopric of Corvey was secularized under Napoleonic administration and became briefly part of the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda. In 1807, it went to Jérôme Bonaparte's Kingdom of Westphalia. After the Congress of Vienna, Corvey fell to the Prussia in 1815. As compensation for lost territory west of the Rhine, it was awarded to Victor Amadeus, the Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg, in 1820.\n\nWhile Corvey had ceased to exist as a political state in 1803, it continued to exist as a diocese until 1825.\n\nLandgrave Victor Amadeus rebuilt the abbey buildings as a \"Schloss\" (palace). In 1834, the property fell to Victor von Hohenlohe-Schillingfürst, a member of the House of Hohenlohe. In 1840, he was granted the title \"Herzog von Ratibor und Fürst von Corvey\" (Duke of Ratibor and Prince of Corvey) by King Frederick William IV of Prussia. Since then, \"Schloss Corvey\" has remained property of the family.\n\nThe famous abbey library has long since been dispersed, but the \"princely library\" (\"Fürstliche Bibliothek\"), an aristocratic family library, containing about 74,000 volumes, mainly in German, French, and English, with a tailing off circa 1834, survives in the \"Schloss\". One striking feature of the collection is the large number of English Romantic novels, some in unique copies, for in Britain fiction was more often borrowed than bought, and was read extensively in the lending libraries. The poet and author of the \"Deutschlandlied\", August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben, worked here as librarian from 1860 until his death in 1874. He is buried in the church graveyard.\n\nThe abbey complex became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in June 2014. The site is delimited by the extent of the original Carolingian monastery, of which only the westwork remains standing today.\n\nThe Carolingian \"Westwerk\" (west front) of the abbey, with its landmark matching towers survives, the earliest standing medieval structure in Westphalia, but most of the abbey church is now Baroque.\n\nThe present owner of the palace is Viktor, 5th Duke of Ratibor and 5th Prince of Corvey, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst-Metternich-Sándor (b. 1964).\n\n\"Schloss\", library and church are today open to the public.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1922311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922311", "title": "Japanese castle", "text": "Japanese castle\n\nThough they were built to last and used more stone in their construction than most Japanese buildings, castles were still constructed primarily of wood, and many were destroyed over the years. This was especially true during the Sengoku period (1467–1603), when many of these castles were first built. However, many were rebuilt, either later in the Sengoku period, in the Edo period (1603–1867) that followed, or more recently, as national heritage sites or museums. Today there are more than one hundred castles extant, or partially extant, in Japan; it is estimated that once there were five thousand. Some castles, such as the ones at Matsue and Kōchi, both built in 1611, remain extant in their original forms, not having suffered any damage from sieges or other threats. Hiroshima Castle, on the opposite end of the spectrum, was destroyed in the atomic bombing, and was rebuilt in 1958 as a museum.\n\nThe character for castle, '城', by itself read as \"shiro\" (its kun'yomi), is read as \"jō\" (the Chinese-derived on'yomi) when attached to a word, such as in the name of a particular castle. Thus, for example, Osaka Castle is called \"Ōsaka-jō\" (大阪城) in Japanese.\n\nOriginally conceived as fortresses for military defense, Japanese castles were placed in strategic locations, along trade routes, roads, and rivers. Though castles continued to be built with these considerations, for centuries, fortresses were also built as centres of governance. By the Sengoku period, they had come to serve as the homes of \"daimyōs\" (feudal lords), to impress and to intimidate rivals not only with their defences but also with their sizes, architecture, and elegant interiors. In 1576, Oda Nobunaga was among the first to build one of these palace-like castles: Azuchi Castle was Japan's first castle to have a tower keep (天守閣, \"tenshukaku\"), and it inspired both Toyotomi Hideyoshi's Osaka Castle and Tokugawa Ieyasu's Edo Castle. Azuchi served as the governing center of Oda's territories, and as his lavish home, but it was also very keenly and strategically placed. A short distance away from the capital of Kyoto, which had long been a target of violence, Azuchi's carefully chosen location allowed it a great degree of control over the transportation and communication routes of Oda's enemies.\n\nBefore the Sengoku period (roughly the 16th century), most castles were called . Though most later castles were built atop mountains or hills, these were built \"from\" the mountains. Trees and other foliage were cleared, and the stone and dirt of the mountain itself was carved into rough fortifications. Ditches were dug, to present obstacles to attackers, as well as to allow boulders to be rolled down at attackers. Moats were created by diverting mountain streams. Buildings were made primarily of wattle and daub, using thatched roofs, or, occasionally, wooden shingles. Small ports in the walls or planks could be used to deploy bows or fire guns from. The main weakness of this style was its general instability. Thatch caught fire even more easily than wood, and weather and soil erosion prevented structures from being particularly large or heavy. Eventually, stone bases began to be used, encasing the hilltop in a layer of fine pebbles, and then a layer of larger rocks over that, with no mortar. This support allowed larger, heavier, and more permanent buildings.\n\nThe first fortifications in Japan were hardly what one generally associates with the term \"castles\". Made primarily of earthworks, or rammed earth, and wood, the earliest fortifications made far greater use of natural defences and topography than anything man-made. These \"kōgoishi\" and \"chashi\" (チャシ, for Ainu castles) were never intended to be long-term defensive positions, let alone residences; the native peoples of the archipelago built fortifications when they were needed and abandoned the sites afterwards.\n\nThe Yamato people began to build cities in earnest in the 7th century, complete with expansive palace complexes, surrounded on four sides with walls and impressive gates. Earthworks and wooden fortresses were also built throughout the countryside to defend the territory from the native Emishi, Ainu and other groups; unlike their primitive predecessors, these were relatively permanent structures, built in peacetime. These were largely built as extensions of natural features, and often consisted of little more than earthworks and wooden barricades.\n\nThe Nara period (c. 710–794) fortress at Dazaifu, from which all of Kyūshū would be governed and defended for centuries afterwards, was originally constructed in this manner, and remnants can still be seen today. A bulwark was constructed around the fortress to serve as a moat to aid in the defense of the structure; in accordance with military strategies and philosophies of the time, it would only be filled with water at times of conflict. This was called a \"mizuki\" (), or \"water fort\". The character for castle or fortress (), up until sometime in the 9th century or later, was read (pronounced) \"ki\", as in this example, \"mizuki\".\n\nThough fairly basic in construction and appearance, these wooden and earthwork structures were designed to impress just as much as to function effectively against attack. Chinese and Korean architecture influenced the design of Japanese buildings, including fortifications, in this period. The remains or ruins of some of these fortresses, decidedly different from what would come later, can still be seen in certain parts of Kyūshū and Tōhoku today.\n\nThe Heian period (794–1185) saw a shift from the need to defend the entire state from invaders to that of lords defending individual mansions or territories from one another. Though battles were still continually fought in the north-east portion of Honshū (the Tōhoku region) against native peoples, the rise of the samurai warrior class towards the end of the period, and various disputes between noble families jostling for power and influence in the Imperial Court brought about further upgrades. The primary defensive concern in the archipelago was no longer native tribes or foreign invaders, but rather internal conflicts within Japan, between rival samurai clans or other increasingly large and powerful factions, and as a result, defensive strategies and attitudes were forced to change and adapt. As factions emerged and loyalties shifted, clans and factions that had helped the Imperial Court became enemies, and defensive networks were broken, or altered through the shifting of alliances.\n\nThe Genpei War (1180–1185) between the Minamoto and Taira clans, and the Nanboku-chō Wars (1336–1392) between the Northern and Southern Imperial Courts are the primary conflicts that define these developments during what is sometimes called Japan's medieval period.\n\nFortifications were still made almost entirely out of wood, and were based largely on earlier modes, and on Chinese and Korean examples. But they began to become larger, to incorporate more buildings, to accommodate larger armies, and to be conceived as more long-lasting structures. This mode of fortification, developed gradually from earlier modes and used throughout the wars of the Heian period (770–1185), and deployed to help defend the shores of Kyūshū from the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, reached its climax in the 1330s, during the Nanboku-chō period. Chihaya Castle and Akasaka castle, permanent castle complexes containing a number of buildings but no tall keep towers, and surrounded by wooden walls, were built by Kusunoki Masashige to be as militarily effective as possible, within the technology and designs of the time.\n\nThe Ashikaga shogunate, established in the 1330s, had a tenuous grip on the archipelago, and maintained relative peace for over a century. Castle design and organization continued to develop under the Ashikaga shogunate, and throughout the Sengoku period. Castle complexes became fairly elaborate, containing a number of structures, some of which were quite complex internally, as they now served as residences, command centres, and a number of other purposes.\n\nThe Ōnin War, which broke out in 1467, marked the beginning of 147 years of widespread warfare (called the Sengoku period) between \"daimyōs\" (feudal lords) across the entire archipelago. For the duration of the Ōnin War (1467–1477), and into the Sengoku period, the entire city of Kyoto became a battlefield, and suffered extensive damage. Noble family mansions across the city became increasingly fortified over this ten-year period, and attempts were made to isolate the city as a whole from the marauding armies of samurai that dominated the landscape for over a century.\n\nAs regional officials and others became the \"daimyōs\", and the country descended into war, they began to quickly add to their power bases, securing their primary residences, and constructing additional fortifications in tactically advantageous or important locations. Originally conceived as purely defensive (martial) structures, or as retirement bunkers where a lord could safely ride out periods of violence in his lands, over the course of the Sengoku period, many of these mountain castles developed into permanent residences, with elaborate exteriors and lavish interiors.\n\nThe beginnings of the shapes and styles now considered to be the \"classic\" Japanese castle design emerged at this time, and castle towns (\"jōkamachi\", \"town below castle\") also appeared and developed. Despite these developments, though, for most of the Sengoku period castles remained essentially larger, more complex versions of the simple wooden fortifications of centuries earlier. It was not until the last thirty years of the period of war that drastic changes would occur to bring about the emergence of the type of castle typified by Himeji Castle and other surviving castles. This period of war culminated in the Azuchi–Momoyama period, the scene of numerous fierce battles, which saw the introduction of firearms and the development of tactics to employ or counter them.\n\nUnlike in Europe, where the advent of the cannon spelled the end of the age of castles, Japanese castle-building was spurred, ironically, by the introduction of firearms. Though firearms first appeared in Japan in 1543, and castle design almost immediately saw developments in reaction, Azuchi castle, built in the 1570s, was the first example of a largely new type of castle, on a larger, grander scale than those that came before, boasting a large stone base (, \"musha-gaeshi\"), a complex arrangement of concentric baileys (, \"maru\"), and a tall central tower. In addition, the castle was located on a plain, rather than on a densely forested mountain, and relied more heavily on architecture and manmade defenses than on its natural environment for protection. These features, along with the general appearance and organization of the Japanese castle, which had matured by this point, have come to define the stereotypical Japanese castle. Along with Hideyoshi's Fushimi–Momoyama castle, Azuchi lends its name to the brief Azuchi–Momoyama period (roughly 1568–1600) in which these types of castles, used for military defense, flourished.\nOsaka Castle was destroyed by cannon. This reproduction towers above the surroundings. The introduction of the arquebus brought dramatic shifts in battle tactics and military attitudes in Japan. Though these shifts were complex and numerous, one of the concepts key to changes in castle design at this time was that of battle at range. Though archery duels had traditionally preceded samurai battles since the Heian period or earlier, exchanges of fire with arquebuses had a far more dramatic effect on the outcome of the battle; hand-to-hand fighting, while still very common, was diminished by the coordinated use of firearms.\n\nOda Nobunaga, one of the most expert commanders in the coordinated tactical use of the new weapon, built his Azuchi castle, which has since come to be seen as the paradigm of the new phase of castle design, with these considerations in mind. The stone foundation resisted damage from arquebus balls better than wood or earthworks, and the overall larger scale of the complex added to the difficulty of destroying it. Tall towers and the castle's location on a plain provided greater visibility from which the garrison could employ their guns, and the complex set of courtyards and baileys provided additional opportunities for defenders to retake portions of the castle that had fallen.\n\nCannon were rare in Japan due to the expense of obtaining them from foreigners, and the difficulty in casting such weapons themselves as the foundries used to make bronze temple bells were simply unsuited to the production of iron or steel cannon. The few cannon that were used were smaller and weaker than those used in European sieges, and many of them were in fact taken from European ships and remounted to serve on land; where the advent of cannon and other artillery brought an end to stone castles in Europe, wooden ones would remain in Japan for several centuries longer. A few castles boasted 'wall guns', but these are presumed to have been little more than large caliber arquebuses, lacking the power of a true cannon. When siege weapons were used in Japan, they were most often trebuchets or catapults in the Chinese style, and they were used as anti-personnel weapons. There is no record that the goal of destroying walls ever entered into the strategy of a Japanese siege. In fact, it was often seen to be more honorable, and more tactically advantageous on the part of the defender for him to lead his forces into battle outside the castle. When battles were not resolved in this way, out in the open, sieges were almost always undertaken purely by denying supplies to the castle, an effort that could last years, but involved little more than surrounding the castle with a force of sufficient size until a surrender could be elicited.\n\nThe crucial development that spurred the emergence of a new type of defensive architecture was, thus, not cannon, but the advent of firearms. Arquebus firing squads and cavalry charges could overcome wooden stockades with relative ease, and so stone castles came into use.\n\nAzuchi Castle was destroyed in 1582, just three years after its completion, but it nevertheless ushered in a new period of castle-building. Among the many castles built in the ensuing years was Hideyoshi's castle at Osaka, completed in 1585. This incorporated all the new features and construction philosophies of Azuchi, and was larger, more prominently located, and longer-lasting. It was the last bastion of resistance against the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate (see Siege of Osaka), and remained prominent if not politically or militarily significant, as the city of Osaka grew up around it, developing into one of Japan's primary commercial centers.\n\nThough stone was sometimes used to shore up defenses or foundations for a few centuries prior, Azuchi's distinctive style of stone base was the first of its kind, and was seen in every castle constructed afterwards. The Japanese used cannon very infrequently, and the heavy stone foundations were more than sufficient to repel arquebus fire. Whether intentionally or not, these foundations also proved very resilient against Japan's frequent earthquakes.\n\nThis period saw the climax of earlier developments towards larger buildings, more complex and concentrated construction, and more elaborate design, both externally and in the castles' interiors. European castle design began to have an impact as well in this period, though the castle had long been in decline in Europe by this point.\n\nIn Japanese politics and warfare, the castle served not only as a fortress, but as the residence of the \"daimyō\" (feudal lord), and as a symbol of his power. Fushimi Castle, which was meant to serve as a luxurious retirement home for Toyotomi Hideyoshi, serves as a popular example of this development. Though it resembled other castles of the period on the outside, the inside was lavishly decorated, and the castle is famous for having a tea room covered in gold leaf. Fushimi was by no means an exception, and many castles bore varying amounts of golden ornamentation on their exteriors. Osaka castle was only one of a number of castles that boasted golden roof tiles, and sculptures of fish, cranes, and tigers. Certainly, outside of such displays of precious metals, the overall aesthetics of the architecture and interiors remained very important, as they do in most aspects of Japanese culture.\n\nSome especially powerful families controlled not one, but a whole string of castles, consisting of a main castle (\"honjō\") and a number of satellite castles (\"shijō\") spread throughout their territory. Though the \"shijō\" were sometimes full-fledged castles with stone bases, they were more frequently fortresses of wood and earthenworks. Often, a system of fire beacons, drums, or conch shells was set up to enable communications between these castles over a great distance. The Hōjō family's Odawara Castle and its network of satellites was one of the most powerful examples of this \"honjō-shijō\" system; the Hōjō controlled so much land that a hierarchy of sub-satellite networks was created\n\nToyotomi Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea took place between 1592 and 1598, at the same time as the high point in Azuchi–Momoyama style castle construction within Japan. Many Japanese castles (called \"Wajō\" 倭城 in Japanese and \"Waeseong\" in Korean) were built along the southern shores of Korea. All that remains of these castles today are the stone bases.\n\nThe Sengoku period, roughly a century and a half of war that brought great changes and developments in military tactics and equipment, as well as the emergence of the Azuchi-Momoyama style castle, was followed by the Edo period, over two hundred and fifty years of peace, beginning around 1600–1615 and ending in 1868. Edo period castles, including survivors from the preceding Azuchi-Momoyama period, therefore no longer had defense against outside forces as their primary purpose. Rather, they served primarily as luxurious homes for the \"daimyōs\", their families and retainers, and to protect the \"daimyō\", and his power base, against peasant uprisings and other internal insurrections. The Tokugawa shogunate, to forestall the amassing of power on the part of the \"daimyōs\", enforced a number of regulations limiting the number of castles to one per \"han\" (feudal domain), with a few exceptions, and a number of other policies including that of \"sankin-kōtai\". Though there were also, at times, restrictions on the size and furnishings of these castles, and although many \"daimyōs\" grew quite poor later in the period, daimyō nevertheless sought as much as possible to use their castles as representations of their power and wealth. The general architectural style did not change much from more martial times, but the furnishings and indoor arrangements could be quite lavish.\n\nThis restriction on the number of castles allowed each \"han\" had profound effects not only politically, as intended, but socially, and in terms of the castles themselves. Where members of the samurai class had previously lived in or around the great number of castles sprinkling the landscape, they now became concentrated in the capitals of the \"han\" and in Edo; the resulting concentration of samurai in the cities, and their near-total absence from the countryside and from cities that were not feudal capitals (Kyoto and Osaka in particular) were important features of the social and cultural landscape of the Edo period. Meanwhile, the castles in the \"han\" capitals inevitably expanded, not only to accommodate the increased number of samurai they now had to support, but also to represent the prestige and power of the \"daimyō\", now consolidated into a single castle. Edo castle, expanded by a factor of twenty between roughly 1600 and 1636 after becoming the shogunal seat. Though obviously something of an exception, the \"shōgun\" not being a regular \"daimyō\", it nevertheless serves as a fine example of these developments. These vastly consolidated and expanded castles, and the great number of samurai living, by necessity, in and around them, thus led to an explosion in urban growth in 17th century Japan.\n\nAs contact with Western powers increased in the middle of the 19th century, some castles such as Goryōkaku in Hokkaidō were turned once again to martial purposes. No longer needed to resist samurai cavalry charges, or arquebus squads, attempts were made to convert Goryōkaku, and a handful of other castles across the country, into defensible positions against the cannon of Western naval vessels.\n\nBefore the feudal system could be completely overturned, castles played a role in the initial resistance to the Meiji Restoration. In January 1868, the Boshin War broke out in Kyoto, between samurai forces loyal to the disaffected Bakufu government, and allied forces loyal to the new Meiji Emperor, which consisted mainly of samurai and rōnin from the Choshu and Satsuma domains. By January 31, the Bakufu army had retreated to Osaka Castle in disarray and the \"shōgun\", Tokugawa Yoshinobu had fled to Edo (later Tokyo). Osaka Castle was surrendered to the Imperial forces without a fight, and on February 3, 1868, Osaka Castle was burned. The destruction of Osaka Castle, which was a significant symbol of the power of the Shogun in western Japan, dealt a major blow to the prestige of the shogunate and the morale of their troops.\n\nFrom Edo, the Bakufu forces fled north to the Aizu domain, from whence a large number of their troops hailed. As the Aizu Campaign opened, Nagaoka and Komine Castles were the scenes of heavy fighting. In the course of battle, Komine Castle was burned (it was re-built in 1994). The allied forces continued north to the city of Wakamatsu, and lay siege to Tsuruga Castle. After a month, with the walls and main tower pock-marked by bullets and cannonballs, Tsuruga Castle was finally surrendered. It was later demolished and not re-built until 1965.\n\nFrom Aizu, some Bakufu loyalists made their way north to the city of Hakodate, on Hokkaido. There they set up the Republic of Ezo, centered on a government building within the walls of Goryōkaku, a French-style star fortress, which is nonetheless often included in lists and in literature on Japanese castles. After the fierce Battle of Hakodate, the fortress of Goryōkaku was under siege, and finally surrendered on May 18, 1869, bringing an end to the Boshin War.\n\nAll castles, along with the feudal domains themselves, were turned over to the Meiji government in the 1871 abolition of the han system. During the Meiji Restoration, these castles were viewed as symbols of the previous ruling elite, and nearly 2,000 castles were dismantled or destroyed. Others were simply abandoned and eventually fell into disrepair.\n\nRebellions continued to break out during the first years of the Meiji period. The last and largest was the Satsuma Rebellion (1877). After heated disagreements in the new Tokyo legislature, young former samurai of the Satsuma domain rashly decided to rebel against the new government, and lobbied Saigō Takamori to lead them. Saigo reluctantly accepted, and led Satsuma forces north from Kagoshima city. Hostilities commenced on February 19, 1877, when the defenders of Kumamoto Castle fired on the Satsuma troops. Fierce hand to hand combat gave way to a siege, but by April 12, reinforcements of the Imperial army arrived to break the siege. After a series of battles, the Satsuma rebels were forced back to Kagoshima city. Fighting continued there, and the stones walls of Kagoshima Castle still show the damage done by bullets. (Kagoshima Castle was never re-built, but portions of the stone walls and the moat were left intact, and later the prefectural history museum was built on the castle's foundation.) The rebel force made their last stand on Shiroyama, or \"Castle Mountain\", probably named for a castle built there some time in the past, whose name has been lost in history. During the final battle, Saigo was mortally wounded, and the last forty rebels charged the Imperial troops and were cut down by Gatling guns. The Satsuma Rebellion came to an end at the Battle of \"Castle Mountain\" on the morning of September 25, 1877.\n\nSome castles, especially the larger ones, were used by the Imperial Japanese Army. Osaka Castle served as the headquarters for the 4th Infantry Division, until public funds paid for the construction of a new headquarters building within the castle grounds and a short distance from the main tower, so that the castle could be enjoyed by the citizens and visitors of Osaka. Hiroshima Castle served as Imperial General Headquarters during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and later as the headquarters for the 5th Infantry Division; Kanazawa Castle served as HQ for the 9th Infantry Division. For this reason, and as a way to strike against the morale and culture of the Japanese people, many castles were intentionally bombed during World War II. The main towers of the castles at Nagoya, Osaka, Okayama, Fukuyama, Wakayama, Ōgaki, among others, were all destroyed during air raids. Hiroshima Castle is notable for having been destroyed in the atomic bomb blast on August 6, 1945. It was also on the grounds of Hiroshima Castle that news of the atomic bombing was first transmitted to Tokyo. When the atomic bomb detonated, a team of volunteer high school girls had just taken their shift on a radio in a small fortified bunker in the main courtyard of Hiroshima Castle. The girls transmitted the message that the city had been destroyed, to the confused disbelief of the officers receiving the message in Tokyo.\n\nShuri Castle (actually a Ryukyuan \"gusuku\"), on Okinawa Island was not only the headquarters for the 32nd Army and the defense of Okinawa, but also has the distinction of the being the last castle in Japan attacked by an invading force. In April 1945, Shuri Castle was the coordinating point for a line of outposts and defensive positions known as the \"Shuri Line\". US Soldiers and Marines encountered fierce resistance and hand-to-hand combat all along the Shuri Line. Starting on May 25, the castle was subjected to three days of intense naval bombardment from the USS Mississippi. On May 28, a company of US Marines took the castle, finding that the intensity of the destruction had prompted the headquarters contingent to abandon the castle and link up with scattered units and continue the defense of the island. On May 30, the US flag was raised over one of the parapets of the castle. Shuri Castle was re-built in 1992, and is now an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Over of the Shuri Castle were burnt down due to an electrical fault on 30 October 2019 at around 2.34 am.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, a new movement for the preservation of heritage grew. The first law for the preservation of sites of historical or cultural significance was enacted in 1919, and was followed ten years later by the 1929 National Treasure Preservation Law. With the enactment of these laws, local governments had an obligation to prevent any further destruction, and they had some of the funds and resources of the national government to improve on these historically significant sites.\n\nBy the 1920s, nationalism was on the rise, and a new pride was found in the castles, which became symbols of Japan's warrior traditions. With new advances in construction, some of the previously destroyed castles were re-built quickly and cheaply with steel-reinforced concrete, such as the main tower of Osaka Castle, which was first re-built in 1928.\n\nWhile many of the remaining castles in Japan are reconstructions, and most of these are steel-reinforced concrete replicas, there has been a movement toward traditional methods of construction. Kanazawa Castle is a remarkable example of a modern reproduction using a significant degree of traditional construction materials and techniques. Modern construction materials at Kanazawa Castle are minimal, discreet, and are primarily in place to ensure stability, safety concerns, and accessibility. At present, there are local non-profit associations that are attempting to collect funds and donations for the historically accurate re-construction of the main towers at Takamatsu Castle on Shikoku, and Edo Castle in Tokyo.\n\nThere are only twelve castles that are considered \"original\":\n\nMost of these are in areas of Japan that were not subjected to the strategic bombing of World War II, such as in Shikoku or in the Japanese Alps. Great care is taken with these structures; open flame and smoking near the castles is usually prohibited, and visitors are usually required to remove their shoes before stepping on the wooden floors (slippers are usually provided). Local legends or ghost stories may also be associated with some of these castles; the most famous is probably the tale of \"Okiku and the Nine Plates\", based on events that occurred at Himeji Castle.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum are castles that have been left in ruins, though usually after archaeological surveys and excavations have been done. Most of these belong to or are maintained by local municipal governments. Some have been incorporated into public parks, such as the ruins of Kuwana Castle and Matsuzaka Castle in Mie Prefecture, Kunohe Castle (Ninohe, Iwate Prefecture), or Sunpu Castle (Shizuoka City). Others have been left in more natural state, often with a marked hiking trail, such as Azaka Castle, (Matsuzaka, Mie Prefecture), Kame Castle (Inawashiro, Fukushima Prefecture), Kikoe Castle (Kagoshima city), or Kanegasaki Castle (Tsuruga city, Fukui Prefecture). The grounds of some were developed with municipal buildings or schools. In Toba, Mie Prefecture, the city hall and an elementary school were built on the site of Toba Castle.\n\nSome castle sites are now in the hands of private landowners, and the area has been developed. Vegetable plots now occupy the site of Kaminogo Castle (Gamagōri, Aichi), and a chestnut orchard has been planted on the site of Nishikawa Castle, though in both cases some of the castle-related topography can still be seen, such as the motte or ramparts.\n\nFinally there are the castle sites that have not been maintained or developed to any degree, and may have few markings or signs. Historical significance and local interest are too low to warrant additional costs. This includes Nagasawa Castle (Toyokawa, Aichi), Sakyoden Castle (Toyohashi, Aichi), Taka Castle (Matsuzaka, Mie), and Kuniyoshi Castle (Mihama, Fukui Prefecture). Castle sites of this type also include nearly every area marked \"Castle Mountain\" ( \"Shiroyama\") on the maps of towns and cities across Japan. Because the castle was small or may have been used for a short time in centuries past, the name of the castle is often lost to history, such as the \"Shiroyama\" at Sekigahara, Gifu Prefecture, or the \"Shiroyama\" between Lake Shōji and Lake Motosu near Mount Fuji, Yamanashi Prefecture. In such cases, locals might not be aware there ever was a castle, believing that the name of the mountain is \"just a name\". Detailed city maps will often have such sites marked. At the site, castle-related landscaping, such as ramparts, partly filled wells, and a leveled hilltop or a series of terraces, will provide evidence of the original layout of the castle.\n\nWhether original or reconstructions, numerous castles across Japan serve as history and folk museums, as points of pride for local people, and as tangible structures reflecting Japanese history and heritage. As castles are associated with the martial valor of past warriors, there are often monuments near castle structures or in their parks dedicated to either samurai or soldiers of the Imperial Army who died in war, such as the monument to the 18th Infantry Regiment near the ruins of Yoshida Castle (Toyohashi, Aichi). Castle grounds are often developed into parks for the benefit of the public, and planted with cherry blossom trees, plum blossom trees, and other flowering plants. Hirosaki Castle in Aomori Prefecture and Matsumae Castle in Hokkaido are both famous in their respective regions for their cherry blossom trees. The efforts of dedicated groups, as well as various agencies of the government has been to keep castles as relevant and visible in the lives of the Japanese people, to showcase them to visitors, and thus prevent the neglect of national heritage.\n\nJapanese castles were built in a variety of environments, but all were constructed within variations of a fairly well-defined architectural scheme. \"Yamajiro\" (山城), or \"mountain castles\" were the most common, and provided the best natural defenses. However, castles built on flat plains (平城, \"hirajiro\") and those built on lowlands hills (平山城, \"hirayamajiro\") were not uncommon, and a few very isolated castles were even built on small natural or artificial islands in lakes or the sea, or along the shore. The science of building and fortifying castles was known as \"chikujō-jutsu\" ().\n\nJapanese castles were almost always built atop a hill or mound, and often an artificial mound would be created for this purpose. This not only aided greatly in the defense of the castle, but also allowed it a greater view over the surrounding land, and made the castle look more impressive and intimidating. In some ways, the use of stone, and the development of the architectural style of the castle, was a natural step up from the wooden stockades of earlier centuries. The hills gave Japanese castles sloping walls, which many argue helped (incidentally) to defend them from Japan's frequent earthquakes. There is some disagreement among scholars as to whether or not these stone bases were easy to scale; some argue that the stones made easy hand- and footholds, while others retort that the bases were steep, and individual stones could be as large as high, making them difficult if not next to impossible to scale.\n\nThus, a number of measures were invented to keep attackers off the walls and to stop them from climbing the castle, including pots of hot sand, gun emplacements, and arrow slits from which defenders could fire at attackers while still enjoying nearly full cover. Spaces in the walls for firing from were called \"sama\"; arrow slits were called \"yasama\", gun emplacements \"tepposama\" and the rarer, later spaces for cannon were known as \"taihosama\". Unlike in European castles, which had walkways built into the walls, in Japanese castles, the walls' timbers would be left sticking inwards, and planks would simply be placed over them to provide a surface for archers or gunners to stand on. This standing space was often called the \"ishi uchi tana\" or \"stone throwing shelf\". Other tactics to hinder attackers' approaches to the walls included caltrops, bamboo spikes planted into the ground at a diagonal, or the use of felled trees, their branches facing outwards and presenting an obstacle to an approaching army (abatis). Many castles also had trapdoors built into their towers, and some even suspended logs from ropes, to drop on attackers.\n\nThe Anō family from Ōmi Province were the foremost castle architects in the late 16th century, and were renowned for building the 45-degree stone bases, which began to be used for keeps, gatehouses, and corner towers, not just for the castle mound as a whole.\n\nJapanese castles, like their European cousins, featured massive stone walls and large moats. However, walls were restricted to the castle compound itself; they were never extended around a \"jōkamachi\" (castle town), and only very rarely were built along borders. This comes from Japan's long history of not fearing invasion, and stands in stark contrast to philosophies of defensive architecture in Europe, China, and many other parts of the world. Even within the walls, a very different architectural style and philosophy applied, as compared to the corresponding European examples. A number of tile-roofed buildings, constructed from plaster over skeletons of wooden beams, lay within the walls, and in later castles, some of these structures would be placed atop smaller stone-covered mounds. These wooden structures were surprisingly fireproof, as a result of the plaster used on the walls. Sometimes a small portion of a building would be constructed of stone, providing a space to store and contain gunpowder.\n\nThough the area inside the walls could be quite large, it did not encompass fields or peasants' homes, and the vast majority of commoners likewise lived outside the castle walls. Samurai lived almost exclusively within the compound, those of higher rank living closer to the daimyō's central keep. In some larger castles, such as Himeji, a secondary inner moat was constructed between this more central area of residences and the outer section where lower-ranking samurai kept their residences. Only a very few commoners, those directly in the employ and service of the daimyō or his retainers, lived within the walls, and they were often designated portions of the compound to live in, according to their occupation, for purposes of administrative efficiency. Overall, it can be said that castle compounds contained only those structures belonging to the daimyō and his retainers, and those important to the administration of the domain.\n\nThe primary method of defense lay in the arrangement of the baileys, called \"maru\" (丸) or . \"Maru\", meaning 'round' or 'circle' in most contexts, here refers to sections of the castle, separated by courtyards. Some castles were arranged in concentric circles, each \"maru\" lying within the last, while others lay their \"maru\" in a row; most used some combination of these two layouts. Since most Japanese castles were built atop a mountain or hill, the topography of the location determined the layout of the \"maru\".\n\nThe \"most central bailey\", containing the keep, was called \"honmaru\" (本丸), and the second and third were called \"ni-no-maru\" (二の丸) and \"san-no-maru\" (三の丸) respectively. These areas contained the main tower and residence of the \"daimyō\", the storerooms (\"kura\" 蔵 or 倉), and the living quarters of the garrison. Larger castles would have additional encircling sections, called \"soto-guruwa\" or \"sōguruwa\". At many castles still standing today in Japan, only the \"honmaru\" remains. Nijō Castle in Kyoto is an interesting exception, in that the \"ni-no-maru\" still stands, while all that remains of the \"honmaru\" is the stone base.\nThe arrangement of gates and walls sees one of the key tactical differences in design between the Japanese castle and its European counterpart. A complex system of a great many gates and courtyards leading up to the central keep serves as one of the key defensive elements. This was, particularly in the case of larger or more important castles, very carefully arranged to impede an invading army and to allow fallen outer portions of the compound to be regained with relative ease by the garrisons of the inner portion. The defenses of Himeji castle are an excellent example of this. Since sieges rarely involved the wholesale destruction of walls, castle designers and defenders could anticipate the ways in which an invading army would move through the compound, from one gate to another. As an invading army passed through the outer rings of the Himeji compound, it would find itself directly under windows from which rocks, hot sand, or other things could be dropped, and also in a position that made them easy shots for archers in the castle's towers. Gates were often placed at tight corners, forcing a bottleneck effect upon the invading force, or even simply at right angles within a square courtyard. Passageways would often lead to blind alleys, and the layout would often prevent visitors (or invaders) from being able to see ahead to where different passages might lead. All in all, these measures made it impossible to enter a castle and travel straight to the keep. Invading armies, as well as, presumably, anyone else entering the castle, would be forced to travel around and around the complex, more or less in a spiral, gradually approaching the center, all while the defenders prepared for battle, and rained down arrows and worse upon the attackers.\n\nAll of that said however, castles were rarely forcibly invaded. It was considered more honorable, and more appropriate, for a defender's army to sally forth from the castle to confront his attackers. When this did not happen, sieges were most often performed not through the use of siege weapons or other methods of forced entry, but by surrounding the enemy castle and simply denying food, water, or other supplies to the fortress. As this tactic could often take months or even years to see results, the besieging army sometimes even built their own castle or fortress nearby. This being the case, \"the castle was less a defensive fortress than a symbol of defensive capacity with which to impress or discourage the enemy\". It of course also served as the lord's residence, a center of authority and governance, and in various ways a similar function to military barracks.\n\nThe castle keep, usually three to five stories tall, is known as the \"tenshukaku\"　(天守閣), and may be linked to a number of smaller buildings of two or three stories. Some castles, notably Azuchi, had keeps of as many as seven stories. The keep was the tallest and most elaborate building in the complex, and often also the largest. The number of stories and building layout as perceived from outside the keep rarely corresponds to the internal layout; for example, what appears to be the third story from outside may in fact be the fourth. This certainly must have helped to confuse attackers, preventing them from knowing which story or which window to attack, and likely disorienting the attacker somewhat once he made his way in through a window.\n\nThe least militarily equipped of the castle buildings, the keep was defended by the walls and towers, and its ornamental role was never ignored; few buildings in Japan, least of all castle keeps, were ever built with attention to function purely over artistic and architectural form. Keeps were meant to be impressive not only in their size and in implying military might, but also in their beauty and the implication of a daimyō's wealth. Though obviously well within the general sphere of Japanese architecture, much of the aesthetics and design of the castle was quite distinct from styles or influences seen in Shintō shrines, Buddhist temples, or Japanese homes. The intricate gables and windows are a fine example of this.\n\nOn those occasions when a castle was infiltrated or invaded by enemy forces, the central keep served as the last bastion of refuge, and a point from which counter-attacks and attempts to retake the castle could be made. If the castle ultimately fell, certain rooms within the keep would more often than not become the site of the \"seppuku\" (ritual suicide) of the daimyō, his family, and closest retainers.\n\nPalisades lined the top of the castle's walls, and patches of trees, usually pines, symbolic of eternity or immortality, were planted along them. These served the dual purpose of adding natural beautiful scenery to a daimyō's home, representing part of his garden, and also obscuring the insides of the castle compound from spies or scouts.\n\nA variety of towers or turrets, called \"yagura\" (櫓), placed at the corners of the walls, over the gates, or in other positions, served a number of purposes. Though some were used for the obvious defensive purposes, and as watchtowers, others served as water towers or for moon-viewing. As the residences of purportedly wealthy and powerful lords, towers for moon-viewing, balconies for taking in the scenery, tea rooms and gardens proliferated. These were by no means solely martial structures, but many elements served dual purposes. Gardens and orchards, for example, though primarily simply for the purpose of adding beauty and a degree of luxuriousness to the lord's residence, could also provide water and fruit in case of supplies running down due to siege, as well as wood for a variety of purposes.\n\nAerial views of Japanese castles reveal a consistent military strategy that informs the over-all planning for each unique location.\n\n\n"}

In Jamaica it is called hogberry (plural hogberries).\n\nIt's valued for its small (between one, and one and a quarter centimeter in diameter) round, sweet yellow fruit which is strongly scented. The fruits have a very pungent and distinct flavor and smell. The taste has been described as combination of pear, lychee and banana. When jarred, the texture resembles that of an green or kalamata olive.\n\n\"Byrsonima crassifolia\" is a slow-growing large shrub or tree to 33 ft (10 m). Sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits, the tree is native and abundant in the wild, sometimes in extensive stands, in open pine forests and grassy savannas, from central Mexico, through Central America, to Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil; it also occurs in Trinidad, Barbados, Curaçao, St. Martin, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and throughout Cuba and the Isle of Pines. The nance is limited to tropical and subtropical climates. In Central and South America, the tree ranges from sea-level to an altitude of 6,000 ft (1,800 m). It is highly drought-tolerant.\nFound in a number of tropical and subtropical ecoregions of the Americas that feature conifers, an example ecoregion of occurrence for \"B. crassifolia\" is the Belizean pine forests.\n\nThe fruits are eaten raw or cooked as dessert. In rural Panama, the dessert prepared with the addition of sugar and flour, known as \"pesada de nance,\" is quite popular.

According to legend, Burns was ploughing in the fields and accidentally destroyed a mouse's nest, which it needed to survive the winter. In fact, Burns's brother claimed that the poet composed the poem while still holding his plough.\n\nJohn Steinbeck took the title of his 1937 novel \"Of Mice and Men\" from a line contained in the penultimate stanza: \"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft agley\" (often paraphrased in English as \"The best-laid plans of mice and men / Go oft awry\").

{"id": "1922352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922352", "title": "Intertitle", "text": "Intertitle\n\nIn films, an intertitle (also known as a title card) is a piece of filmed, printed text edited into the midst of (i.e. \"inter-\") the photographed action at various points. Intertitles used to convey character dialogue are referred to as \"dialogue intertitles\", and those used to provide related descriptive/narrative material are referred to as \"expository intertitles\". In modern usage, the terms refer to similar text and logo material inserted at or near the start of films and television shows.\n\nIn this era intertitles were always called \"subtitles\" and often had Art Deco motifs. They were a mainstay of silent films once the films became of sufficient length and detail to necessitate dialogue or narration to make sense of the enacted or documented events. \"The British Film Catalogue\" credits the 1898 film \"Our New General Servant\" by Robert W. Paul as the first British film to use intertitles. Film scholar Kamilla Elliott identifies another early use of intertitles in the 1901 British film \"Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost\". The first Academy Awards presentation in 1929 included an award for \"Best Writing - Title Cards\" that went to Joseph W. Farnham for the films \"Fair Co-Ed\", \"Laugh, Clown, Laugh\", and \"Telling the World\". The award was never given again, as intertitles went out of common use due to the introduction of \"talkies\".\n\nIn modern use, intertitles are used to supply an epigraph, such as a poem, or to distinguish various \"acts\" of a film or multimedia production by use as a title card. However, they are most commonly used as part of a historical drama's epilogue to explain what happened to the depicted characters and events after the conclusion of the story proper.\n\nThe development of the soundtrack slowly eliminated their utility as a narrative device (they were common for providing narration, but not dialogue, well into the 1930s), but they are occasionally still used as an artistic device. For instance, intertitles were used as a gimmick in \"Frasier\". The BBC's drama \"Threads\" uses them to give location, date and information on distant events beyond Sheffield. \"Law & Order\" and its related spinoffs used them to give not only the location, but also the date of the upcoming scene. Guy Maddin is a modern filmmaker known for recreating the style of older films, and uses intertitles appropriately. Some locally produced shows, such as quiz bowl game shows, use animated variations of intertitles to introduce the next round.\n\nIntertitles have had a long history in the area of amateur film as well. The efforts of home movie aficionados to intertitle their works post-production have led to the development of a number of innovative approaches to the challenge. Frequently lacking access to high-quality film dubbing and splicing equipment, amateur film makers must plan ahead when making a film to allow space for filming an intertitle over the existing film. Intertitles may be printed neatly on a piece of paper, a card, or a piece of cardboard and filmed, or they may be formed from adhesive strips and affixed to glass. In the early 1980s, digital recording technology improved to the point where intertitles could be created in born-digital format and recorded directly onto the film. Several specialty accessories from this period such as Sony's HVT-2100 Titler and cameras such as Matsushita's Quasar VK-743 and Zenith VC-1800 could be used to generate intertitles for home movies. Early 1980s video game consoles and applications catering to the demo scene were also adapted for the generation and recording of intertitles for home films. Among these were included the ColecoVision, the Magnavox Odyssey² (using programs such as the \"Type & Talk\" cartridge and the \"Voice\" module), the Bally Astrocade (using the built-in \"Scribbling\" program or the more advanced \"Creative Crayon\" cartridge), and the intertitle-specialized Famicom Titler.\n"}

The station is owned by Sonshine Family Television. WBPH-TV's studios are located in Allentown, and its transmitter is located on South Mountain near Allentown (specifically Salisbury Township in the Lehigh Valley region of the state).\n\nThe station was an outgrowth of Christian programming that Pat Huber had begun on a local public-access cable television channel. In 1985, Huber formed the Sonshine Family Television Corporation and applied for a television broadcast license with the Federal Communications Commission. The station first signed on the air on December 27, 1990.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nIn 2002, WBPH applied to have its digital channel assignment reallocated from UHF channel 59 to VHF channel 9. The reason for this was that both the station's analog and digital channels were among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that would be removed from broadcasting use upon the formal transition to digital broadcasts. With the FCC's approval of this application, WBPH became the first station in the Lehigh Valley to broadcast on a VHF channel.\n\nWBPH shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 60, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition VHF channel 9. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 60, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.\n\nWBPH broadcasts select programs from The Worship Network, along with locally produced special interest programs, religious programming and Lafayette College sports events. Since the station's inception, two of WBPH's in-house programs have been \"60 Live\" and \"Bethlehem Glory\", both hosted by station owner Pat Huber. The station affiliated with FamilyNet until it converted to a secular classic sitcom format in 2013 and ended all over-the-air affiliate contracts in 2017 after converting to a new Western sports format as The Cowboy Channel; WBPH continues to air programming recorded pre-2013 from FamilyNet.\n\nWBPH is also an affiliate of the Lafayette Sports Network. Broadcasts are produced by RCN channel 4 and include all of Lafayette College's football games (including early rounds of the playoffs) and all men's and women's basketball home games. Very few of the basketball team's away games are televised by the station, though one notable exception are men's games played at Princeton University.\n\nWBPH also carries a Spanish-language newscast produced by WFMZ-TV.\n\nThrough the course of its existence, the station has also produced shows in conjunction with area radio stations and churches. One program that had short-lived popularity among area church youth was \"Live from Studio 60\". Produced along with WBYO (88.9 FM), \"Live from Studio 60\" showcased local Christian bands performing to a live audience at the WBPH-TV studio in Allentown. The program reached its peak in 2000 when it played host to Christian band The Waiting, in conjunction with the Fallout concert, a large Christian music festival held annually in the Lehigh Valley as a promotional event for See You at the Pole. The end of the program was brought on by the need to put efforts into the building of their three megawatt transmitter facility to reach beyond the Lehigh Valley into Philadelphia.\n\nWBPH also previously carried the Easton-Phillipsburg Thanksgiving football game; that game, as of 2015, now airs on WFMZ.\n\nPresently, WBPH-TV is seen on cable systems in most of the Philadelphia media market. Exceptions are a majority of Chester County, most of southern New Jersey, and Delaware. The majority of areas in which WBPH-TV is carried are those within reach of the station's over-the-air broadcast signal.\n\nVerizon FiOS began carrying WBPH on April 17, 2020.\n\nWBPH-TV is carried on Dish Network channel 8169. It is also carried on DirecTV channel 60 in the Philadelphia market.\n\n\n"}

It was at the time the largest of the six townships in the county.\n\nThe California gold rush beginning in 1848 drew prospectors from around the world. Many travelled by sea to Alameda County and took the road through Sunol and Livermore valleys towards the mountains. \n\nIn 1853, Murray Township was established as one of 6 Alameda County townships and given a seat on the board of supervisors. In 1902, Pleasanton Township was created from part of Murray township. By 1910, Pleasanton, with a population of 2883, followed by Murray, with a population of 4137, were the least populous of the seven townships. \n\nIn its early settlement, the area was mostly used for cattle ranching. The climate proved ideal for wine cultivation, so many land owners planted vineyards from the 1880s onwards. \n\nAll the towns in Murray Township remained small and dominated by agriculture until the 1950s, when the population boomed and land was subdivided for developments. \n\nThe geographical landforms of the area include Amador Valley (named after José Maria Amador), Livermore Valley (named after Robert Livermore), Sunol Valley (named after Antonio Suñol), Alamo Valley, and Tassajara Valley. Arroyo de la Laguna is the major waterway which flows south from Amador Valley into Alameda Creek. Arroyo Valle and Arroyo Mocho feed the Laguna from the mountains to the east.\n\nJosé Maria Amador was one of the first Spanish settlers to Murray township in 1835, and the town of Amador, which became Dublin, developed from his property. The town of Livermore arose from a station on the Central Pacific railroad in 1869. Corrall Hollow, on the eastern border of the county, was a pass in which coal was discovered in 1860. Pleasanton was located in the former Rancho Valle de San Jose, where the population grew rapidly from 1861. Rancho Santa Rita, or Alviso, was located to the east. Altamont was another town with a post office in the region. \n\n\n"}

The first permanent settlement in the area was Mission San José, established in 1797. The township was formed in 1853, and named for president George Washington.\n\nEvents leading to the formation of the township began in 1797 with the establishment of Mission San José by the Spanish. Many Ohlone Native Americans settled at the mission to work, ending their traditional village life of hunting and gathering. In 1834, Mexico released California's Native Americans from the control of the mission system, as well as giving the mission property to caretakers. \n\nSeveral Mexican land grants were given from this area. Fulgencia Higuera received a grant known as Rancho Agua Caliente in 1839. Andrews Pico and Juan B. Alvarado were granted the outer lands of Mission San José, known as Rancho Ex-Mission San José, in 1846, but it was taken from them by California courts in 1859. Thomas Pacheco and Augustin Alviso received Rancho Potrero de los Cerritos in 1844, and José de Jesus Vallejo received Rancho Arroyo de la Alameda (which extended into Eden Township) in 1842. \n\nThe California gold rush beginning in 1848 brought many prospectors to travel through the Mission San José area to the mountains, making the Mission an important trading site. \n\nIn 1849, California became a United States territory, and the area became part of Santa Clara County. In 1853, Alameda County was formed from portions of Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties, and was divided into six townships including Washington. Alvarado in present-day Union City was designated as the county seat.\n\nWashington Township is bounded to the west by the San Francisco Bay, and to the east by a mountain range that includes the 2,520-foot-tall Mission Peak. Alameda Creek runs from east to west through Niles Canyon, which was used as a passage for the first transcontinental railroad.\n\nAlameda Creek is the most important stream in Alameda County and the Township. From this Creek is derived the name of the County. Alameda Creek was the former boundary between Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties during the period from 1850, when Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties were formed, to 1853 when Alameda County was carved from these two Counties. The portion of Washington Township south of Alameda Creek is the only part of Alameda County that is not derived from Contra Costa County.\n"}

On February 3, 1959, the Lockheed L-188 Electra performing the flight crashed into the East River, killing 65 of the 73 people on board. Poor weather conditions at the destination meant that the crew had to descend through dense clouds and fog, but the aircraft flew lower than the pilots intended and it crashed into the icy river short of the runway at a speed of . American Airlines had been flying the type of aircraft in commercial service for only about two weeks before the accident.\n\nEyewitnesses to the accident reported that the aircraft was flying significantly lower than what was normal for planes approaching the airport, while surviving flight crew members claimed that the aircraft's instruments had told them that the flight was operating at normal altitudes right up to the moment of impact. An investigation by the Civil Aeronautics Board concluded that mistakes by the flight crew, the flight crew's inexperience flying the type of aircraft, and poor weather conditions were the causes of the crash. The conclusion was challenged by the Air Line Pilots Association, who felt that the crash was caused by faulty instruments and poor weather conditions, not by any mistakes made by the highly experienced flight crew. \n\nAmerican Airlines Flight 320 was a regularly-scheduled flight between Chicago and New York City using one of the company's newly obtained Lockheed L-188 Electra turbine propeller aircraft. The airline had first started flying the new aircraft on January 23, 1959, and it offered six daily round-trip flights on its routes between New York and Chicago, with plans to expand to other routes once more of the new aircraft were delivered. \n\nOn the evening of February 3, 1959, the flight was scheduled to leave Chicago's Midway airport, but wind-driven snow had delayed the departure. The flight was eventually airborne at 9:54p.m. Eastern time, fifty four minutes late, and was one of the last flights to depart Chicago that evening before the airport was closed due to the storm. 68 passengers and 5 crew members were aboard, and the trip was expected to take one hour and forty-two minutes. The climb out of Chicago and the flight to the New York City area was uneventful, operating on automatic pilot at a cruising altitude of 21,000 feet.\n\nAt 11:34p.m., the flight approached the New York City area. Air traffic controllers at LaGuardia airport informed the pilots that the current weather conditions at the airport included overcast skies with a four-hundred foot ceiling with a mile and a quarter visibility. The tower controller instructed the flight to proceed to the north of the airport, and to prepare to perform a direct approach over the East River to land on runway 22. At 11:55p.m., while the aircraft was from the airport, controllers gave the flight its final landing clearance for runway 22. The flight crew acknowledged the clearance with a simple acknowledgement of \"320\", and there was no further radio communication. Moments later, the aircraft struck the surface of the East River about short of the runway, at a speed of .\n\nA witness aboard a nearby tugboat reported seeing the aircraft flying very low over the river before it hit the water with a tremendous noise. Another crew member on the same tugboat stated that he saw the aircraft hit the water, and that he thought the aircraft hit at nose-down angle. A witness in a car approaching the Whitestone Bridge described seeing the aircraft pass overhead at an altitude of about 100 feet. He did not notice if the landing gear was down but he said he could see the whole belly and the lights on the aircraft. Surviving passengers and crew members in the main cabin said that the descent prior to the crash seemed to be uneventful and routine. Interviews with a number of residents in the area revealed that many reported hearing the Electra fly overhead and that it sounded like it was flying lower than usual.\n\nThe accident was the first crash involving the Lockheed L-188 Electra aircraft, which had begun commercial service at American Airlines in the previous weeks. It was the first accident involving an American Airlines aircraft since the crash of American Airlines Flight 327 on January 6, 1957.\n\nA privately-owned tugboat from New England was on the river near the site of the crash when boat's crew heard the impact. It cut loose the barges that it had been towing and was the first to arrive at the scene, lighting up the area with the boat's searchlight. All eight of the survivors of the crash were saved by the crew, including one man who was pulled from four feet below the surface of the water. At least a dozen boats from the Coast Guard and the police, and two police helicopters arrived minutes later. In the dark fog, rescuers could hear screams from survivors, but poor visibility and swift river currents made recovery of victims and survivors extremely difficult. Responders and nearby residents in the area reported hearing cries for help from locations considerably distant from the crash site. \n\nPublic safety agencies set up four rescue stations along the river to evacuate survivors, but ambulances that were taking injured survivors to hospitals had difficulty navigating the icy roads. Survivors were taken to Flushing Hospital and Queens General Hospital, where some of the initial survivors died of their injuries. Two temporary morgues were also set up on opposite sides of the river to receive victims.\n\nBy 5:00a.m. the next morning, at least 9 survivors had been recovered, 22 bodies had been located, and 39 other victims were still missing. High winds and driving rain led the searchers to suspend the rescue operation. The New York Red Cross furnished supplies of rare blood types to aid the victims of the crash. Bodies that had been recovered were taken to Queens General Hospital for identification with assistance by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and 25 city detectives. The agents used fingerprint records from its immigration, personal identification, and war service files to identify the victims.\n\nAfter the impact, the body of the aircraft had broken into several pieces, with a twenty-foot section of the fuselage the largest intact section. After two hours, only three feet of the tail of the aircraft was visible above the surface of the water. Searchers on boats and on the shore picked up plane debris, personal belongings, and mail that had been aboard the aircraft. \n\nIn Washington DC, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) immediately dispatched two investigators as soon as authorities became aware of the crash, and ordered the airline's records to be impounded. An additional team of 25 investigators was assembled and dispatched later the next day. The team was given the task of investigating all aspects of the flight, including the weather, flight operations, engines and propellers, flight instruments, and aircraft structures. Queens County District Attorney Frank O'Connor also started an inquiry, with the aim of setting up a system of rescue boats to serve the city's two airports. The House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee called the head of the Federal Aviation Agency to report on the accident in a closed session in the days after the accident. After the two-and-a-half-hour meeting, a special House subcommittee was named to investigate the crash and the overall safety issues raised by the transition to jet and turboprop aircraft. \n\nDays after the crash, news sources started reporting that there were safety systems that had not been in place at the airport that could have helped prevent the crash. A representative of the Air Line Pilots Association said that a system of flashing lights known as the Electronic Flash Approach System could have helped the pilot judge his altitude, if it had been installed. The association also called for the installation of a more comprehensive instrument landing system that would have provided altitude guidance to flight crews landing on runway 22 in addition to the existing system that provided horizontal guidance. Such a system was already installed at the opposite end of the runway that the flight had been approaching. At the time, there were only two airports in the United States that had such a system installed on both ends of a runway. At a meeting on February 5,commissioners of the Port of New York Authority explained that the installation of such a system on runway 22 was considered to be very difficult because the approach lighting system would block the waterway used by ships to reach docks in Queens.\n\nThe aircraft was a Lockheed L-188 Electra turbine propeller aircraft, serial number 1015, registered as tail number N6101A. It had been manufactured by the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation on November 27, 1958. At the time of the crash, the aircraft had flown for a total of 302 hours. It was powered by four Allison 501-D13 engines.\n\nPromoted as an efficient, fast, and profitable aircraft, the Electra was the first turbine propeller aircraft to be produced in the United States. The first plane was delivered to Eastern Air Lines in October 1958, who began operating commercial flights with the aircraft on January 1, 1959. American Airlines took delivery of its first Electra in December 1958 and its first commercial flight was twelve days before the crash. After the crash of American Airlines flight 320, two more Electras crashed in the following months after suffering catastrophic structural failures; Braniff Flight 542 crashed in September 1959 and Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 710 crashed in March 1960. Both incidents resulted in the loss of everybody aboard. After extensive research, Lockheed identified and corrected a flaw in the engine mounts which had been the cause of the structural failures of the other two crashes, but the negative publicity surrounding all of the accidents involving the plane within a short period of time led to the loss of public confidence in the safety of the aircraft, and only 174 were ever produced.\n\nThe flight carried 68 passengers and 5 crew members, all residents of the United States. Of the 68 passengers, 5 survived; the bodies of two of the victims were never recovered. One of the two flight attendants and the captain of the flight died in the crash. Included in the passengers who died in the crash was Beulah Zachary, the executive producer of the television series \"Kukla, Fran and Ollie\" that was broadcast from 1947 to 1957. Also aboard the plane was Robert Emerson, a research professor at the University of Illinois who was internationally known for his research into plant photosynthesis, and Herbert Greenwald, a Chicago real estate developer.\n\nThe pilot of the flight, Captain Albert Hunt DeWitt, was 59 years old. He started his career at American Airlines in 1929 by flying for Thompson Aeronautical Corporation of Cleveland, which was later acquired by American. A resident of Decatur, Michigan, he was qualified to fly all of the aircraft that had been operated by American Airlines and was considered one of the most experienced commercial pilots in the world, with seven million miles flown. He had a total of 28,135 hours of flight experience, including 48 hours in the Lockheed Electra and 2,500 hours of instrument time, and had at one time acted as one of American's chief pilots in the New York area.He learned to fly airplanes when he was 24 years old. In 1930, he had been involved in an accident while he was flying a mail plane over Mishawaka, Indiana on his way to Chicago. Caught in a severe snowstorm, his aircraft stalled and entered a spin, but he was able to jump out of his plane before it crashed and he landed in a 75-foot-high tree. Before joining American Airlines, he had been a barnstormer in Indiana and Michigan and had been an instructor for various flying schools and clubs in the 1920s. He served in both World Wars; in World War I, he was a motorcycle courier, and during World War II, he served as an instructor at flight schools in New York and Chicago. He had planned to retire that May, but did not survive the crash of Flight 320. His cause of death was listed as drowning, but the medical examiner stated that he had also suffered severe internal injuries that would probably have been fatal had he not drowned.\n\nThe first officer, 33-year-old Frank Hlavacek, was a resident of Wilmette, Illinois and had been employed with the company for eight years. He had a total of 10,192 logged hours, of which 36 hours were in the Electra. He had been flying since he was 14 years old and had served with the United States Army Air Forces in World War II. Before joining American Airlines, he had owned his own air service based in La Jolla, California. After the crash, he helped two of the survivors reach the remnants of the plane's wing, where they were rescued. He suffered a broken jaw and pelvis, and two broken legs in the crash as well as internal injuries, but eventually recovered and returned to work at American Airlines.\n\nThe flight engineer, Warren Cook, was 36 years old and had been working for American Airlines for eleven years. He had a total of 8,700 flying hours, of which 81 were in the Electra. He served in the United States Army Air Corps from 1940 to 1945. In the accident, he suffered a badly wrenched back, cuts, and bruises. After recovering from his injuries, he returned to work at American Airlines.\n\nWithin two hours of the accident, investigators conducted an interview with flight engineer Warren Cook, in which he stated that the flight's descent was completely routine right up to the point where the aircraft unexpectedly hit the water. They were unable to immediately interview first officer Frank Hlavacek because of his medical condition, but when interviewed several days later, he told investigators that he had been calling out indicated altitudes to Captain DeWitt during the descent in one-hundred-foot instruments as they approached the runway. He said that he had barely gotten the words out for five hundred feet when the plane struck the river. Cook's statement to investigators, taken independently at a separate hospital, confirmed that they struck the river just as Hlavacek was saying \"five hundred feet\". \n\nRecovery of the wreckage of the aircraft began as soon as the weather conditions permitted, with 25 percent of the plane recovered by February 5, and fifty percent by the following day. The day after the crash, salvage cranes attempted to raise the fuselage of the aircraft to the surface of the water, but they were only briefly successful before it broke apart and most of the it fell back into the water. The tail section was raised by crews on the evening of February 5, and newspaper articles reported that the damage to that section suggested that the aircraft may have crashed in a \"nose up\" position, as though the pilot had noticed at the last minute that he was well short of the runway. Divers were brought in to locate missing sections of the aircraft beneath the surface of the water, but recovery efforts were hindered by high winds, strong river currents, and murky waters. Some pieces of the plane had been swept away by currents and had had been found as far away as Northport, Long Island, more than thirty miles away. Each piece was identified, tagged, and cleaned off, and relocated to Hangar 9 of the Marine Terminal of La Guardia Airport. The nose section and cockpit was recovered late on February 7. The cockpit was salvaged in good condition, with the spring-wound clock on the instrument panel still working when the section was recovered from the river. Investigators predicted that it would take at least two weeks to check all of the instruments to determine if they were functioning correctly at the time of the accident. Early reports from the investigation revealed that the condition of the flight control surfaces revealed that at the time of impact, the aircraft had not been in a violent turn or dive when it hit the water.\n\nOn February 9, the Federal Aviation Agency announced that flying restrictions would be put in place on bad-weather landings by Lockheed Electra aircraft. The restrictions increased the minimum visibility conditions required for landing in poor conditions. In communications with flight crews, both American Airlines and Eastern Airlines described the restrictions as temporary only, likely lasting only a few days. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation expressed disappointment in the new restrictions, but agreed to cooperate with the investigation to the fullest extent. The following day, the Agency reversed course, and said that the Electra airliners could resume normal operation if they replaced the new altimeters with old-style altimeters. Both airliners agreed to immediately replace the altimeters as a precautionary step. The Agency also extended the order include the requirement that new-style altimeters that had been installed in Boeing 707 aircraft needed to be replaced.\n\nThe altimeters used in the aircraft had been an early focus of the investigation. The units that Lockheed had used in its Electra turboprops were a different style than what had been used in older piston-type aircraft. The older type used three hands of different lengths to indicate the aircraft's altitude, but the new design combined a needle that displayed hundreds of feet and a rectangular display with numbers printed on rotating drums that indicated the thousands of feet. The Kollman Instrument Corporation, which built both types, described the new style as a \"precision drum altimeter\" and said that it had been \"developed as a result of a human engineering study made by the Aero Medical Laboratory, by an unnamed Government body, and at the instigation of the Air Force, primarily to meet the needs of faster flying.\" The Air Force had experienced numerous problems with the older-style altimeters where its pilots had made 10,000-foot mistakes. Pilots training on the new aircraft reported several instances where they had misread the altitude on the new altimeters, causing them to misread the aircraft's altitude by up to 1,000 feet. Because of the confusion, early reports said that the airline had made plans to install an additional third altimeter of the old type in the center of the pilot's panel while continuing to use the newer style altimeters. Pilots for Eastern Airlines who had been flying the Electra aircraft also complained about the new style of altimeter, stating that not only were they easy to misinterpret, but they tended to lag behind the older style. That airline had installed a third, old-style, altimeter in their cockpits. American Airlines defended the new style altimeter as \"a new and far superior altimeter with finer gradations\" and denied that it had received complaints with the instruments. It acknowledged that it had planned to install a third altimeter in the cockpits, but said that the third unit was planned to be a new-style model. At the time of the accident, the aircraft in Flight 320 still only had the two original altimeters.\n\nAccident investigators took the altimeters that were recovered from the crash to the instrument shop at La Guardia Airport for detailed examination. \n\nAn investigative hearing of the CAB began in New York City on March 18, 1959. In testimony before the board, first officer Hlavacek confirmed the information that he had given in his earlier interviews and stated that he and the other crew members had checked their altimeters several times during the flight including when they passed by Newark, New Jersey, saying that his and the pilot's altimeter were very close. He said that at the time of the crash, the pilot had been using the automatic pilot with partial manual control during the approach, and also said that some ice had formed at the top of the windshield, but it had not been considered serious. He said that he had not seen any sign of the runway through the windshield ahead, but that he had caught sight of a few reddish lights flashing past his side windows just before impact. The investigative board confronted Flight engineer Cook with transcripts of an interview that he had given immediately after the accident, in which he stated that the aircraft's altimeter had shown under one hundred feet at the time of impact, but he had later testified that it showed five hundred feet. Cook stated that at the time, he was in a state of shock and that in his mind he had mistaken the one on the drum to mean one hundred feet instead of one thousand feet. He confirmed that he had turned on de-icing equipment before the plane had started its descent, and confirmed that the pilot had been using the automatic pilot to fly the plane during the descent. He said that he had been flying with Captain Dewitt since 1951, that he knew him well, and that it was the pilot's custom to use the automatic pilot to descend until about 400 feet above the runway, when he would switch to manual control. He also testified that he had seen nothing but blackness through the windshield up to the time of the crash.\n\nOn February 26, an article in the Chicago Tribune reported that after the altimeters had been cleaned of corrosion, water, and dirt, they had been tested in a pressure chamber. It said that both of the devices functioned normally down to 1000 feet above ground pressure level, but below 1,000 feet they stuck or lagged considerably. However, in official testimony before the board, the manufacturer of the altimeters submitted a report to the board that said that their investigation concluded that the instruments did not have any mechanical failure or malfunction before the crash. When they had been salvaged from the water, the pilot's and co-pilot's instruments had indicated minus 1,500 feet and minus 1,640 feet respectively, reflecting damage to parts of the instruments caused by immersion pressure. When questioned, the investigator acknowledged that there was no means to determine what the altimeters showed at the time of impact. In testimony before the investigative board, the airline's director of flying said that the identical malfunction of two altimeters at the same time was \"almost mathematically impossible\". The board heard from experts from the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation who had attempted to reproduce a 500-foot error in the reported altitude caused by ice buildup in the air pressure lines. They flew an Electra plane behind an Air Force tanker that was spraying ice-producing water to see if they could cause the pressure line to clog. In other tests, they artificially plugged the line, affected the opening various equipment and even had a mechanic spray a stream of water directly into the pressure port. None of the tests produced the 500-foot error that was reported by the pilots, and produced an error only of forty or fifty feet.\n\nIn trying to determine why the crew of the Electra had not seen the runway ahead of them, the board heard from two pilots of a Northeast Airlines DC-3 that had landed at La Guardia Airport a minute or two in front of the Electra. They testified that they had had no problem coming in under the 400-foot cloud ceiling and that they could see the whole mile-long runway ahead of them. However, interviews with crash survivors and crew members of the rescue tug suggested that an isolated patch of low clouds and fog was hanging over the river at the time of the crash. \n\nThe Civil Aeronautics Board released a final report on the accident on January 10, 1960. The investigators concluded that the crew had been preoccupied with aspects of flight and had neglected to monitor essential flight instruments during the descent, leading to a premature descent below landing minimums. Contributing to the accident were factors including the crew's limited experience with the aircraft type, a faulty approach technique in which the autopilot was used to or almost to the surface, an erroneous setting of the pilot's altimeter, marginal weather in the approach area, possible misinterpretation of the altimeter and the rate of descent indicators on the aircraft, and the crew's sensory illusion with respect to height and altitude resulting from a lack of visual references. The board was critical of the airline's lack of adequate simulator training on the aircraft before placing it into passenger service, and made recommendations to the FAA that all large turbine-engine aircraft used in air transportation be equipped with a flight recorder.\n\nOver 90 percent of the primary structural components of the aircraft and most of the systems components were recovered by investigators. They found that at the moment of impact, the flaps were approximately in the approach position, the landing gear was extended, and propeller blade angles were relatively uniform and consistent with the power readings obtained from the recovered aircraft instruments and consistent with the testimony of the crew regarding the power being used during the approach. Neither of the two vertical speed indicator mechanisms were recovered. Both altimeters were recovered, but since the diaphragms of both had been overstressed due to submersion, it was impossible to establish the calibration or accuracy of either altimeter before the crash. \n\nInvestigators obtained all of the maintenance records including pilot complaints of all operators, civil and military, of the type of altimeter used in the flight. None of the reported incidents involved more than one of the altimeters installed at a time, and after reviewing the possibility of a simultaneous failure of both altimeters, the board concluded that it would involve such an extreme mathematical improbability that it chose to reject that theory as well as reject portions of the testimony of the surviving crew members. It also concluded that after consideration of all possible scenarios, that a failure of only one of the altimeters was unlikely to have occurred. Based upon eyewitness testimony and analysis of the point of impact, the board concluded that it was likely that one or more of the pilots had misread the altimeter due to their unfamiliarity with the new style. It also concluded that there was a possibility that the crew had misread the vertical speed indicators, which also used a different scale than what had been used in older aircraft or in the training received by the captain.\n\nThe board concluded that all of the required airport, boundary, and runway lights were on and functioning at the time of the accident. However, because the lights were slanted upward at between three and five degrees, and because of a dike located between the end of runway 22 and the water, they would not have been visible by the crew if the actual altitude of the aircraft was too low.\n\nThe board's conclusions were soundly criticized by the president of the Air Line Pilots Association, who called the report \"grossly inaccurate in a number of respects\", and that the report failed to satisfactorily explain the reason for the accident and assumed factors that had not been established by fact. He said that pilots at American Airlines were united in protest against the report, saying it \"slandered and wrongfully accused\" crew members of the plane, and was aimed at \"conveniently writing the accident off the books\" rather than accurately determining a cause. He said that in the association's judgement, the crash was the result of marginal weather conditions and inadequate approach and lighting aids at the airport. First officer Frank Hlavacek said he was \"furious\" over the CAB report, saying the board tried to take the easy way out by blaming a dead captain. He said he hoped that American Airlines would protest the report.\n\nOn February 6, 1959 a special House subcommittee was named to investigate the crash and overall safety issues that the aviation industry was experiencing while transitioning from piston aircraft to jet and turboprop aircraft. The subcommittee was headed by Representative John Bell Williams of Mississippi, a former World War II bomber pilot. Representative Oren Harris of Arkansas said the subcommittee would look into the equipment that was being used on the new aircraft as well as the training of their crews. The five members of the subcommittee visited La Guardia Field on February 12, and inspected the runway where Flight 320 had been trying to reach, but refused to publicly discuss the results of their investigation. In March, the committee announced that it was investigating the Federal Aviation Agency for suppressing information that the committee had requested about the difficulties that had been encountered with the new type of altimeters used in the Lockheed Electra and Boeing 707 aircraft. \n\nDuring hearings of the aviation subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee in January 1960, the safety director for the CAB testified that if the La Guardia runway had been equipped with high density lights, \"the accident probably would not have happened\". He also advocated for more training of copilots of aircraft and the installation of electronic flight recorders in aircraft to assist with accident investigations. As a result of the testimony, three of the senators on the subcommittee called for the installation of modern lighting systems at Chicago's Midway airport and other landing fields, and the implementation of requirements that copilots be certified on the aircraft they fly. Elwood Richard Quesada, administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency, testified that the government had pledged to pay 75 percent of the cost to install high intensity lighting and radar approaches at La Guardia prior to the accident, but that officials at the airport had declined to pay the 25 percent required for local cooperation. \n"}

{"id": "1922374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922374", "title": "Whirlaway", "text": "Whirlaway\n\nWhirlaway (April 2, 1938 – April 6, 1953) was an American champion thoroughbred racehorse. The chestnut horse was sired by English Derby winner Blenheim, out of the broodmare Dustwhirl. Whirlaway was bred at Calumet Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. Trained by Ben A. Jones and ridden by Eddie Arcaro, Whirlaway won the U.S. Triple Crown in 1941. Whirlaway was widely known as \"Mr. Longtail\" because his tail was especially long and thick and it would blow far out behind him during races, flowing dramatically in the wind.\n\nHe was voted the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt in 1940 by \"Turf & Sports Digest\" magazine. The rival \"Daily Racing Form\" award was won by Our Boots.\n\nJimmy Jones, son of the colt's trainer, recalled that \"Whirlaway was a creature of habit. You had to create habits for him. So we created the habits we wanted him to do.\" Whirlaway was regarded as having a \"quirky\" personality. The champion colt had a habit of \"bearing out,\" drifting toward the middle of the racetrack, during the latter part of his races and losing as a result. In preparations for the Kentucky Derby, this had been such a problem that trainer Ben A. Jones fitted the colt with a full-cup blinker over his right eye. In Whirlaway's final workout before the Derby, Jones cut a small hole in the blinker so that the horse had a tiny field of vision. Jones positioned himself ten feet off the inner rail and told jockey Eddie Arcaro to ride the horse through that space. Whirlaway was able to see his trainer, Arcaro was able to keep him on a straight path, and Whirlaway won the Kentucky Derby by tying the current (as of 2018) record margin of 8 lengths.\n\nTrained by Ben A. Jones and ridden by Arcaro, Whirlaway won the U.S. Triple Crown in 1941. He also won the Lawrence Realization Stakes and the Travers Stakes that year; Whirlaway is the only horse ever to win both the Triple Crown and the Travers, sometimes referred to as a \"superfecta\". He was voted the Horse of the Year in 1941, beating Alsab by 96 votes to 91 in a poll conducted by the \"Turf and Sport Digest\" magazine. A year later, Whirlaway repeated his win in the poll, beating Alsab with 76 votes to his rival's 45.\n\nArcaro was the sole rider for Whirlaway in all of his 3-year-old victories, but dismounted for most of the 1942 season, when he served a long suspension for racing infractions. Jockey George Woolf took the reins for the majority of the 1942 season. In a major upset on July 4, 1942 at Empire City Race Track, Whirlaway ran second to Tola Rose who easily won by four lengths in track record time. Whirlaway and Alsab continued their 1941 rivalry through 1942. On September 19, 1942, Alsab defeated the Triple Crown champion in a match race at Narragansett Park in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Although Whirlaway closed strongly through the stretch, Alsab lasted by a nose as both horses flew home through the stretch run. Whirlaway was named Horse of the Year for 1942 after defeating Alsab in a subsequent race and having 12 wins for the year to Alsab's 9.\n\nWoolf, who had previously won the Pimlico Special in 1938 on Seabiscuit and in 1940 on Challedon, rode the 1941 Triple Crown winner at a leisurely pace during the 1942 Pimlico Special in a walkover victory. No opponent had been found to challenge Whirlaway for the race. On December 12, more than twenty thousand people turned out to watch Whirlaway win the inaugural Louisiana Handicap at the Fair Grounds Race Course. The newly formed Thoroughbred Racing Association staged this event as a war-relief effort.\n\nWhirlaway entered stud at Calumet Farm in the spring of 1944 at age six. Among his best offspring were Scattered (winner of the Coaching Club American Oaks); Whirl Some (Selima Stakes), Dart By (All American Handicap) and Whirling Bat (winner of the 1951 Louisiana Derby). In August 1950, Calumet Farm leased Whirlaway to French breeder Marcel Boussac, who stood the horse at his breeding farm, Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard. Boussac purchased Whirlaway from Calumet in September 1952. The stallion died at Boussac's French stud in 1953.\n\nWhirlaway was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1959. In The Blood-Horse magazine's ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th century, he was No. 26. Whirlaway has a race named in his honor at Saratoga Race Course.\n\n"}
{"id": "1922382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922382", "title": "Fence (criminal)", "text": "Fence (criminal)\n\nA fence, also known as a receiver, mover, or moving man, is an individual who knowingly buys stolen goods in order to later resell them for profit. The fence acts as a middleman between thieves and the eventual buyers of stolen goods who may not be aware that the goods are stolen. As a verb, the word describes the behaviour of the thief in the transaction: \"The burglar fenced the stolen radio\". This sense of the term came from thieves' slang, first attested c. 1700, from the notion of such transactions providing a \"defence\" against being caught. The term remains in common use in all major dialects of modern English, all of which spell it with a \"c\" even though the source word in some dialects (particularly American English) is now spelled \"defense.\"\n\nThe thief who patronizes the fence is willing to accept a low profit margin in order to reduce their risks by instantly \"washing their hands\" of the black market loot and disassociating from the criminal act that procured it. After the sale, the fence recoups their investment by disguising the stolen nature of the goods (via methods such as repackaging and altering/effacing serial numbers) and reselling the goods as near to the white market price as possible without drawing suspicion. This process often relies on a legal business (such as a pawnshop, flea market or street vendor) in order to \"launder\" the stolen goods by intermixing them with legally-purchased items of the same type. The fence is able to make a profit with stolen merchandise because they are able to secretly pay thieves a very low price for \"hot\" goods that cannot be easily sold on the open markets. Fencing is illegal in all countries, but legally proving a violation of anti-fencing laws can be difficult.\n\nThe fence, or receiver, is an old kind of criminal, historically attested in many countries and with deep and complex dynamics within society.\n\nReceiving was a widespread crime in Modern England and an increasingly crucial concern for the English government of that period. It involved many other kinds of activities and crimes, and it saw its peak in the early 18th century with the notorious Jonathan Wild. Receiving is intrinsically connected to theft, as receivers, by definition, buy previously stolen goods in order to make profit out of them later. When organised theft grew increasingly important in London thanks to largely supportive receivers, the establishment started to fight it off with new laws, often aimed at receivers: receiving was acknowledged as the very core of property crime.\n\nReceiving was not considered as a felony (crime) in common law until 1691, when fences became potential targets of charges as accessories to theft. This meant that in order to judge a suspected receiver, it was necessary to condemn the related thief first. Later laws further focused on receivers, especially the 1718 Transportation Act, which, together with other measures, made fences main felons and not simply accessories to other felonies. Nonetheless, it was not easy to prove that a dealer knowingly accepted stolen goods, especially without the related theft event being fully cleared out.\nProceedings stored in the Old Bailey Online archive where the offence category is receiving are 5664. Of these, 1973 have a verdict category of guilty.\n\nThe 1718 Transportation Act also made a felony of returning goods for a fee, revealing that by then, receiving had already been widely taken to the next stage: returning goods to their owner, for a fee, instead of selling them in the second-hand market. Thieves could act as go-betweens themselves, but go-betweens could raise some suspicions, while relying on receivers added a safety layer against effective prosecution. A victim of theft was often willing to pay in order to get his goods back, in order to spare himself further troubles and/or if the items taken had the potential to reveal unflattering details about his personal affairs. In addition to that, for many centuries, prosecution in England was entirely at the expense (of personal money, time and effort) of the prosecutor. Therefore, also considering the difficulty of actually proving receiving in courts, common people, especially shopkeepers, often preferred compounding, feeling that prosecuting was not worth it. This gave a considerable advantage to receivers.\n\nIn order to effectively act as go-betweens for compounding, or brokers, fences needed to personally know thieves or have ways to easily interact and bargain with them for a common benefit about compounding: nobody was in a better position to do so than thief-takers. Thief-takers grew increasingly notorious in England as a reward was introduced by the Crown for each successfully condemned criminal. Some of them, such as Anthony Dunn, publicly referred to as \"pretended Thiefe-taker\" in a 1707 document, used their social power as thief-takers as an advantage for receiving. Thief-takers were usually so involved with thieves and gangs of thieves that they could easily condemn them for the reward, or use this power to intimidate and command thieves to do their biddings: in exchange of clemency or protection from capture or condemnation, they could have thieves to steal under their command. Indeed, thief-takers could act as direct instigators, supporting their thieves with intelligence or offering them shelter at need (when convenient), and then act as receivers with the stolen goods. Through parallel occupations, receivers could feed their own business.\n\nConfirmation of how thief-taking and receiving were tightly connected could be seen in the career of Charles Hitchen, who was known as a thief-taker. He bought off the position of Under City Marshal through his wife's money in order to have one of the best positions amongst the thief-takers of the City. However, a vast part of his income actually came from the receiving activity related to the network of connections with London's underworld. Hitchen controlled this network through his official (that is to say, legal) position as a thief-taker.\n\nThe synergy between receiving, theft and corruption, as well as official activities such as thief-taking or pawnbroking was a huge dynamic bond where each element enhanced the others in a vicious circle.\n\nThe master of this powerful synergy of London underworld was Jonathan Wild, who rapidly replaced his previous master, Charles Hitchen, in 1713, and rapidly gained control of London's crime and the title of \"thief-taker general\". His power was due to his ruthless thief-taking and intimidation activities as well as a complex web of intelligence also built around the diffusion of newspapers. However, overly bold receiving was his undoing, as it grew so large and complex a matter to prompt the English government to promote further laws against receiving and related activities, such as the Transportation Act in 1718, also known as \"Jonathan Wild Act\", and its extension in 1720, which made returning goods for a fee a felony of the same importance and punishment as the crime (theft) related to the goods returned (which meant a capital offence in most cases, with raised potential reward for definitive evidence, from £40 to £140). Eventually, the government decided to directly take action against Wild through lawyers, succeeding in condemning and executing him in 1725.\n\nThere is no registered case of female fences of the same fame of Wild or Hitchen. However, women had active roles in both receiving and theft. Elizabeth Hitchen, Hitchen's wife, gave her inheritance money to her husband in order to buy the Under City Marshal office for his plans. Moreover, women could also be active fences. For example, Elizabeth Fisher managed her own receiving business in her husband's alehouse.\nProceedings stored in the Old Bailey Online archive where the offence category is receiving are 5664. Of these, 1858 have a defendant gender category of female.\n\nReceiving grew increasingly important in Early Modern society, and combined with the increasing interest of society on reading, it became the source for many writers, such as Daniel Defoe, with Moll Flanders and John Gay, with The Beggar's Opera. \nThese works reflect how receiving was conceived and portrayed by authors.\n\n\"Moll Flanders\" is a novel intended to narrate the whole life of its protagonist, referred to as Moll Flanders, but a relevant part of it is about her becoming a master thief. Moll's activity as a thief largely relied on the protection and support of her governess, who acted also as a receiver for the goods stolen by her affiliates. She is the one who buys Moll's stolen goods the first time, as Moll narrates \"I was now at a loss for a market for my goods,[...] At last I resolved to go to my old governess.\" Therefore, the governess character sealed Moll's fate as a thief, and eventually taught her the basics of thievery redirecting Moll to work with other senior thieves. With these events, Defoe shows how crucial as well as subtle receiving was in building the whole of crime activity in London.\n\nThe Governess is officially a pawnbroker, and she uses this legal business to recycle stolen goods into the secondary market. Sometimes, such as in the case of a silver inscribed mug stolen by Moll, she smelts metals, in order to avoid getting caught while re-selling. Along with receiving activity, she actively protects and support many criminals and thieves in order to secure a steady income to her activity.\n\nThe same governess goes on in protecting and offering refuge to her affiliates whenever possible, or recruiting thieves into small groups, always via middlemen, in order to protect their thieves' identities in case some of them were caught and willing to confess.\n\nShe is also a main intelligence source and often a direct instigator to theft such as in a case of fire in a well-off house in the neighbourhood (more vulnerable to theft because of the sudden emergency), and finally becomes a broker for goods stolen by Moll to a drunken gentleman. In that case, the amount gained is allegedly greater than what she would have gained by standard re-selling in the secondary market.\n\nThe Governess embodies female social cunning in London's underworld, from Defoe's point of view. She is a typical receiver of her time, and whereas many male receivers used thief-taking as an official business, she relies on pawnbroking.\n\nUnder traditional Chinese law a fence, or receiver, (銷贓者), was a merchant who bought and sold stolen goods. Fences were part of the extensive network of accomplices in the criminal underground of Ming and Qing China. Their occupation entailed criminal activity, but as fences often had a non-criminal primary occupation, they acted as liaisons between the respectable community and the criminal underworld, living a “precarious existence on the fringes of respectable society”.\n\nFences often worked alongside bandits in a network of criminal accomplices that was essential to ensuring both the safety and the success of fences.\n\nThe path into the occupation of a fence stemmed, in a large degree, from necessity. As most fences came from the ranks of poorer people, they often took whatever work they could - both legal and illegal. In many circumstances, working as a fence was an option that was not too strenuous, but had the potential to bring in a fair sum of income.\n\nMost fences worked within their own town or village. For example, in some satellite areas of the capital, military troops lived within or close to the commoner population and they had the opportunity to hold illegal trades with commoners.\n\nIn areas like Baoding and Hejian, local peasants and community members not only purchased military livestock such as horses and cattle, but also helped to hide the “stolen livestock from [the] military”. In such circumstances that benefited them, local peasants and other members of the community became fences and hid criminal activities from officials, in exchange for goods or money from soldiers.\n\nMost fences were not individuals who only bought and sold stolen goods to make a living. The majority of fences had a variety of official occupations within the \"polite\" society. These occupations included laborers and peddlers, among others. Such individuals often encountered criminals, often in the markets while working, and formed acquaintances and temporary associations for mutual aid and protection. In one example, an owner of a teahouse overheard the conversation between Deng Yawen, a criminal, and others planning a robbery and offered to help to sell the loot for a portion of the spoils.\n\nAt times, the robbers themselves filled the role of fences, selling to people they met on the road. This may actually have been preferable for robbers, in certain circumstances, because they would not have to pay the fence a portion of the spoils.\n\nButchers were also prime receivers for stolen animals because of the simple fact that owners could no longer recognize their livestock after the animal had been slaughtered. Animals were very valuable commodities within Ming China, and a robber could potentially sustain a living from stealing livestock and selling them to butcher-fences.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of the time, fences worked with physical stolen property, fences who also worked as itinerant barbers also sold information as a good. Itinerant barbers often amassed important sources of information and news as they traveled, and sold significant pieces of information to those who offered money. Often, such information was sold to criminals in search of places to hide or individuals to rob. In this way, itinerant barbers also served the role as a keeper of information that could be sold to both members of the criminal underground, as well as powerful clients.\n\nFences not only sold items such as jewelry and clothing but was also occasionally involved in human trafficking hostages that banditires had kidnapped. Women and children were the easiest to sell and among the most common “objects” the fences sold. Most of the female hostages were sold to fences and then sold as prostitutes, wives, or concubines. One example of human trafficking can be seen from Chen Akuei's gang who abducted a servant girl and sold her to Lin Baimao, who in turn sold her as a wife for thirty pieces of silver. In contrast to women who required beauty to sell for a high price, children were sold regardless of their physical appearance or family background. Young boys were often sold as servants or entertainers, while young girls were often sold as prostitutes.\n\nLike merchants of honest goods, one of the most significant tools of a fence was their network of connections. As they were the middlemen between robbers and clients, fences needed to form and maintain widespread connections in both the “polite” society, as well as among criminals. However, there were cases in which members of the so-called “well-respected” society become receivers and harbourers. They not only help bandits to sell the stolen goods but also acted as agents of the bandits in collecting protection money from local merchants and residents. These \"part-time\" fences with high social status used their connection with bandits to help themselves gain social capital as well as wealth.\n\nIt was extremely important to their occupation that fences maintained a positive relationship with their customers, especially their richer gentry clients. When some members of the local elites joined the ranks of fences, they not only protected bandits to protect their own business interests, but they actively took down any potential threats to their illegal profiting, even government officials. In the Zhejiang Province, the local elites not only caused the dismissal of provincial commissioner, Zhu Wan, but also eventually “[drove] him to suicide”.\n\nIt was also essential for them to maintain a relationship with bandits in order to protect their livelihood. However, it was just as true that bandits needed fences to make a living. As a result, fences often held dominance in their relationship with bandits. Taking advantage of their dominance in their relationships with bandits, fences also cheated bandits by manipulating the prices they paid bandits for stolen property. This was possible because fences often had an official and legal means of making a living, as well as illegal activities and could threaten to turn in bandits into the authorities.\n\nAside from simply buying and selling stolen goods, fences often played additional roles in the criminal underground of early China. Inns and teahouses often became ideal places for banditries and gangs to gather in order to exchange information and plan for their next crime. Harborers, people who provided safe houses for criminals, often played the role of a fence as well, in receiving stolen goods from their harbored criminals to sell to other customers. Safe houses also included brothels and opium dens, as well as gambling parlors, and employees or owners of such institutions often functioned as harborers, as well as fences. These safe houses were located in places where there was a high floating population and people from a great variety of social backgrounds interacted.\n\nBrothels also helped bandits to hide and sell stolen goods because of the special Ming Law that exempted brothels from being held responsible “for the criminal actions of their clients.” Although the government required brothel owners to report any suspicious activity, the lack of government enforcement as well as the motivation of owners to make an extra income from fencing led brothels to become an ideal safe house for bandits and gangs.\n\nPawnshops were also often affiliated with fencing stolen goods. The owners or employees of such shops often paid a low sum far below market value for stolen goods to bandits, and resold the goods to earn a profit.\n\nTwo different Ming Laws, the \"Da Ming Lü 大明律\" and the \"Da Gao 大诰,\" drafted by the Hongwu Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, sentenced fences to different penalties based on the category and value of the products that were stolen.\n\nIn coastal regions, illegal trading with foreigners, as well as smuggling became a huge concern for the government during the mid to late Ming era. To prohibit this crime, the government passed a law in which illegal smugglers who traded with foreigners without the consent of the government would be punished with exile to the border for military service.\n\nIn areas where military troops were stationed, stealing and selling military property would result in more severe punishment. In the Jiaqing time, a case was recorded of a robber stealing and selling military horses. The emperor himself gave orders that the thieves who had stolen the horses and the people who had helped to sell the horses would be put on a cangue and sent to labor in a border military camp.\n\nIn the salt mines, the penalty for workers who stole and/or sold salt was the most severe. Because of the enormous value of salt in Ming China, anyone who was arrested and found guilty of stealing and selling government salt was put to death.\n\nFencing is often conducted through legal businesses. Some fences maintain a legitimate-seeming \"front\" through which they can sell stolen merchandise. Depending on the type of stolen merchandise a fence deals in, \"front\" businesses might be discount stores, used goods stores, a coin and gem store, auction house, flea market, or auto salvage yards. The degree of illicit activity in each \"front\" business may differ from fence to fence. While one fence's salvage yard may consist mainly of stolen auto parts, another fence's used goods store might consist mainly of legitimately purchased used goods, with the stolen merchandise acting as a minor, but profitable, sideline.\n\nThieves agree to this because their alternatives may present a greater risk of the thief being caught. As well, selling stolen goods takes a great deal of time and effort (transaction costs), as the thief would have to try to contact a number of potential buyers and show them the merchandise. Some habitual thieves are so well known to police that if the thief were to attempt to sell any used goods, this would quickly draw the attention of law enforcement. The fence then disguises the stolen nature of the goods, if possible, so that he or she can sell them closer to the market price. Depending on the stolen item, the fence may attempt to remove, deface, or replace serial numbers on the stolen item before reselling it. In some cases, fences will transport the stolen items to a different city to sell them, because this lessens the likelihood that the items will be recognized. For some types of stolen goods, fences disassemble the good and sell the individual parts, because the sale of parts is less risky. For example, a stolen car or bicycle may be disassembled so that the parts can be sold individually. Another tactic used by some fences is to retain stolen items for some time before selling them, which lessens the likelihood that the burglary victims or police will be actively looking for the items in auctions and pawnshops.\n\nThe prices fences pay thieves typically depend both on norms and on legitimate market rates for the items in question. Vulnerable sellers, such as drug addicts or casual thieves, may receive less than 20% of an item's value. Higher prices, sometimes as high as 50% of an item's value in a legal market, can be commanded by a professional thief, especially one who concentrates on valuable items. At the same time, fences will often take advantage of thieves by deceiving them about the value of an individual item and the relevant market conditions. For example, a fence may falsely tell a petty thief that the market for the type of good which the thief is selling is flooded with this type of merchandise, to justify paying out a lower price.\n\nThere are a number of different types of fences. One way of categorizing fences is by the type of good in which they trade, such as jewels, power tools, or electronics. Another way of categorizing fences is by their level of involvement in buying and selling stolen goods; for some, fencing is an occasional \"sideline\" activity, while it is an economic mainstay for others. At the lowest level, a hustler or drug dealer may occasionally accept stolen goods. At the highest level would be a fence whose main criminal income comes from buying and selling stolen items. At the broadest level, two tiers of fences can be distinguished. The lower level of fences are those who directly buy stolen goods from thieves and burglars. At a higher level are the \"master fences\", who do not deal with street-level thieves, but only with other fences.\n\nResearch on fences shows that they view themselves as entrepreneurs, relying on networking with and patronage by prominent criminals to become successful in their word-of-mouth-based \"wheeling and dealing\". They occupy the middle ground between the criminal world (thieves, burglars and shoplifters) and the legitimate world (e.g., everyday people who purchase used goods). Some active fences go farther in their business, maintaining longstanding contacts and even teaching thieves how to practice their craft, whether by identifying specific products or by teaching them tools of the trade.\n\nThe degree to which the purchasers of the stolen goods know or suspect that the items are stolen varies. If a purchaser buys a high-quality item for a low price, in cash, from a stranger at a bar or from the back of a van, there is a higher likelihood that the items may be stolen. On the other hand, if a purchaser buys the same high-quality item for the standard retail price from a used goods store, and obtains a proper receipt, the purchaser may reasonably believe that the item is not stolen (even if, in fact, it is a stolen item).\n\nE-fencing is the sale of items on the Internet that have been obtained illegally. Besides the involvement of the Internet, there are some other key differences when discussing activities that have come to be thought of as \"e-fencing\" compared to \"traditional\" fencing that should be understood. The common elements to both are that fraudulently obtained goods and/or services are being bought and sold in a (series of) transactions(s) involving a \"minimum of three\" distinct parties. In traditional fencing these parties are usually understood to be the thief who stole the goods, (a) fence(s) who act(s) as (an) intermediary(ies) and the final purchaser, with only the final purchaser (possibly) being the innocent and unwitting party. On the other hand, e-fencing is also used frequently to describe transactions where there is some direct interaction between the original thief and the final purchaser - in a typical such case, the \"intermediary\" is an online platform, but when discussing e-fencing (unlike traditional fencing) the level of culpability on the part of the \"intermediary\" platform varies greatly. On one hand, the platform's operators may be knowingly or recklessly permitting such activity (such as is typically the case with a darknet market) and thus might be thought of as a \"fence\" in a more traditional sense. At the other extreme are \"intermediaies\" that are legitimate and respected platforms being used in defiance of their terms and conditions and in spite of aggressive and ongoing actions to interdict such illegal activities.\n\nE-fencing is an activity that criminals often mix with sales to pawnbrokers. The auction website eBay, being easy to reach for the average thief, is a popular location for e-fencing; customers reported more than eight thousand crimes from the website in 2008, many of which involved the sale of stolen property. Classified websites like Craigslist, AutoTrader.com, Pennysaver online, etc. are some of the Internet sources used for fencing goods online and circumventing the middleman fencer, in addition to a number of illegal darknet markets.\n\nE-fenced items may be shoplifted or otherwise stolen, alternatively they may be purchased using stolen credit cards or similar banking information. The latter practice is often intertwined with carding, which is the trafficking of thousands or even millions of stolen credit card numbers. The sale of stolen credit cards, which usually takes place on the darknet markets, is generally considered to be a form of e-fencing in its own right, and often plays a role in supplying the data used to purchase physical goods that may be either e-fenced themselves or fenced through more traditional means.\n\nCrime rings steal and/or use stolen financial information to pay for in-demand items from retailers and then sell them online, relying on the Internet's ability to reach buyers around the world and its anonymity; some theft rings even take pre-orders, confident that they can steal and/or fraudulently pay for whatever is currently in demand. In the United States, major retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target have advocated for federal legislation to combat Internet fencing. Proposals for such legislation have often proposed requiring major sales websites (e.g. eBay and Amazon.com) to retain some items' serial numbers and to release information to retailers about major sellers whom the retailers believe to be relying on stolen property. Such proposals have been opposed by the online retailers who would be required to maintain these records and take these actions.\n\nIn addition to physical goods, stolen financial information can also be e-fenced by using such data to purchase intangible goods and services on behalf of unsuspecting buyers. In some cases, criminals anonymously pose as agents selling items such as airline tickets at significantly discounted prices, while they are actually using stolen financial information to purchase such goods and services at the regular price from legitimate websites using the real identity of the final purchaser. Such criminals often request payment in cryptocurrency such as bitcoin to further cover their tracks. Once the fraud is discovered, it is usually the final purchaser(s) who will be held liable for the full amount of the purchase(s), and possibly even be at risk of criminal prosecution themselves depending on the jurisdiction. One airline representative described the practice as being \"akin to buying a television set in a bar.\" \n\nAn eBay spokesman has stated, \"Perhaps the dumbest place to try to fence stolen materials is on eBay,\" and news agencies have reported incidents of the police purchasing stolen property directly from thieves, leading to their capture. By early 2007, e-fencing had become a $37 billion business.\n\nFencing is illegal almost everywhere, usually under a similar rationale as in the United States, where receipt of stolen property is a crime in every state, as well as a federal crime if the property crossed a state line. Occasionally federal agents will temporarily set up a false fence sting operation. Fencing is a common source of income for organized crime. In England and Wales, as in many U.S. states, the crime requires three elements: stolen property, the receiver's act of receiving or hiding it, and his knowledge of its stolen status.\n\nPawnbrokers have often been associated with fencing, though in many jurisdictions, government identification must be shown in order to pawn an item and police regularly check pawnshops for stolen goods and repossess any stolen items. While pawnbrokers do not like this characterization of their business, police efforts have indicated that some pawnbrokers are involved in fencing.\n\n\n"}

Mayer\n\nArno Joseph Mayer (born June 19, 1926) is a Luxembourg-born American historian who specializes in modern Europe, diplomatic history, and the Holocaust, and is currently the Dayton-Stockton Professor of History, Emeritus, at Princeton University.\n\nMayer was born in 1926 into a Jewish family that fled to the United States during the Nazi invasion of Luxembourg in May 1940. He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1944; that same year he was drafted into the United States Army and served as an intelligence officer. He eventually became a morale officer for high-ranking German prisoners of war. He received his education at the City College of New York, the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva and Yale University. He has been professor at Wesleyan University (1952–53), Brandeis University (1954–58) and Harvard University (1958–61). He has taught at Princeton University since 1961.\n\nA self-proclaimed \"left dissident Marxist\", Mayer's major interests are in modernization theory and what he calls \"The Thirty Years' Crisis\" between 1914 and 1945. Mayer posits that Europe was characterized in the 19th century by a rapid modernization in the economic field by industrialization and retardation in the political field. He has argued that what he refers to as \"The Thirty Years' Crisis\" was caused by the problems of a dynamic new society produced by industrialization facing a rigid political order. He feels that the aristocracy in all of the European countries held far too much power, and it was their efforts to keep power that led to World War I, the rise of fascism, World War II, and the Holocaust.\n\nIn a 1967 essay \"The Primacy of Domestic Politics\", Mayer made a \"Primat der Innenpolitik\" (\"primacy of domestic politics\") argument for the origins of World War I. Mayer rejected the traditional \"Primat der Außenpolitik\" (\"primacy of foreign politics\") argument of traditional diplomatic history on the grounds that it failed to take into account that in Mayer's opinion, all of the major European countries were in a \"revolutionary situation\" in 1914, and thus ignores what Mayer considers to be the crucial impact that domestic politics had on foreign-policy making elites. In Mayer's opinion, in 1914, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was on the verge of civil war and massive industrial unrest, Italy had been rocked by the Red Week of June 1914, the French Left and Right were waging a war to the death with each other, Germany was faced with ever-increasing political strife, Russia was facing a huge strike wave, and Austria-Hungary was confronted with rising ethnic and class tensions. Mayer insists that liberalism and centrist ideologies in general were disintegrating in face of the challenge from the extreme right in the UK, France and Italy while being a non-existent force in Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia. Mayer ended his essay by arguing that World War I should be best understood as a pre-emptive \"counterrevolutionary\" strike by ruling elites in Europe to preserve their power by distracting public attention onto foreign affairs.\n\nMayer argued in his \"Politics and Diplomacy of Peacemaking\" (1967), which won the American Historical Association's 1968 Herbert Baxter Adams Prize, that the Paris Peace Conference was a struggle between what he called the \"Old Diplomacy\" of the alliance system, secret treaties and brutal power politics and the \"New Diplomacy\" as represented by Vladimir Lenin's Decree on Peace of 1917 and Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which Mayer sees as promoting peaceful and rational diplomacy. He described the world of 1919 as divided between the \"forces of movement\", representing liberal and left-wing forces, behind the \"New Diplomacy\" and the \"forces of order\", representing conservative and reactionary forces, behind the \"Old Diplomacy\". Mayer sees all foreign policy as basically a projection of domestic politics, and much of his writing on international relations is devoted towards explaining just what domestic lobby was exerting the most influence on foreign policy at that particular moment of time. In Mayer's view, the \"New Diplomacy\", associated with Lenin and Wilson, was associated with Russia and America, both societies that Mayer has argued either had destroyed or lacked the partial \"modernized\" societies that characterized the rest of Europe. He sees the United States' diplomacy at Versailles as an attempt to establish a \"new\", but \"counter-revolutionary\" style of diplomacy against \"revolutionary\" Soviet diplomacy.\n\nIn Mayer's view, the greatest failure of the Treaty of Versailles was that it was a triumph for the \"Old Diplomacy\" with a thin \"New Diplomacy\" veneer. According to Mayer, the irrational fears generated by the Russian Revolution led to an international system designed to contain the Soviet Union. A major influence on Mayer is the British historian E. H. Carr, who was his friend and mentor. In 1961, Mayer played a key role in the American publication of Carr's book \"What Is History?\" Many of Mayer's writings on international affairs in the interwar era take as their starting point Carr's 1939 book \"The Twenty Year's Crisis\".\n\nIn his 1981 book, \"The Persistence of the Old Regime\", Mayer argued that there was an \"umbilical cord\" linking all the events of European history from 1914 to 1945. In Mayer's opinion, World War I was proof that, \"[t]hough losing ground to the forces of industrial capitalism, the forces of the old order were still sufficiently willful and powerful to resist and slow down the course of history, if necessary by recourse to violence.\" Mayer argued that because of its ownership of the majority of the land in Europe and because the middle class were divided and politically undeveloped, the nobility continued as the dominant class in Europe. Mayer argued that faced with the challenge of a world in which they had lost their function, the aristocracy both embraced and promoted reactionary beliefs such as those of Friedrich Nietzsche and Social Darwinism, together with a belief in dictatorship and fascist dictatorship in particular. In Mayer's view, \"It would take two world wars and the Holocaust […] finally to dislodge the feudal and aristocratic presumption from Europe's civil and political societies.\"\n\nIn his 1988 book \"Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?\" Mayer argues that Adolf Hitler ordered the Final Solution in December 1941 in response to the realisation that the Wehrmacht could not take Moscow, hence ensuring Nazi Germany's defeat at the hands of the Soviet Union. In Mayer's opinion, the Judeocide (Mayer's preferred term for the Holocaust) was the horrific climax of the \"Thirty Years' Crisis\" that had been raging in Europe since 1914. The book views the Holocaust as primarily an expression of anti-communism:\n\nAnti-Semitism did not play a decisive or even significant role in the growth of the Nazi movement and electorate. The appeals of Nazism were many and complex. People rallied to a syncretic creed of ultra-nationalism, Social Darwinism, anti-Marxism, anti-bolshevism, and anti-Semitism, as well as to a party program calling for the revision of Versailles, the repeal of reparations, the curb of industrial capitalism, and the establishment of a \"völkisch\" welfare state.\n\nMayer stated that one purpose of his in writing \"Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?\" was to put an end to a \"cult of remembrance\" that, in his view, had \"become overly sectarian\". Mayer has often accused Israel of exploiting the memory of the Holocaust to further its foreign policy objectives. In his opinion, Hitler's war was first and foremost against the Soviets, not the Jews. According to Mayer, the original German plan was to defeat the Soviet Union, and then to deport all the Soviet Jews to a reservation behind the Urals.\n\nIn regards to the functionalist-intentionalist divide that once pervaded Holocaust historiography, Mayer's work can be seen as a bridge between the two schools. Mayer argues that there was no masterplan for genocide, and that the Holocaust cannot be explained solely in regards to Hitler's world view. At the same time, Mayer does agree with intentionalist historians such as Andreas Hillgruber (with whom Mayer otherwise has little in common) in seeing Operation Barbarossa, and the Nazi crusade to annihilate \"Judeo-Bolshevism\" as the key development in the genesis of the \"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\".\n\n\"Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?\" met with hostile reviews. The British historian Richard J. Evans, in summing up their reviews of the book, noted that some of their more \"printable\" responses included: \"a mockery of memory and history\" and \"bizarre and perverse\".\n\nTwo prominent critics of \"Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?\" were Daniel Goldhagen and Lucy Dawidowicz. Both questioned Mayer's account of the murder of Jews during the early phases of World War II, arguing the organized and systemic role played by the Nazis was much greater. Both accused Mayer of attempting to rationalize the Holocaust, comparing him to the right-wing historian Ernst Nolte. The American historian Peter Baldwin considered that Goldhagen had missed Mayer's overall point about the connection between the war against the Soviet Union and the Holocaust, while Guttenplan described their \"distortion\" of Mayer's views as \"disgraceful\", going on to note that\n\nArno Mayer's book opens with \"A Personal Preface\" telling of his own hair-raising escape from Luxembourg and occupied France, and of the fate of his grandfather, who refused to leave Luxembourg and died in Theresienstadt. Such personal bona fides didn't prevent the Anti-Defamation League from including Mayer in its 1993 \"Hitler's Apologists: The Anti-Semitic Propaganda of Holocaust Revisionism\", where his work is cited as an example of \"legitimate historical scholarship which relativizes the genocide of the Jews.\" Mayer's crime is to \"have argued, with no apparent anti-Semitic motivation\"—note how the absence of evidence itself becomes incriminating—\"that though millions of Jews were killed during WWII, there was actually no premeditated policy for this destruction.\"\nReviewers criticized Mayer's account of the Holocaust as focused too heavily on Nazi anti-communism at the expense of a focus on antisemitism. Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer alleged that\n\nwhen a Holocaust survivor such as Arno J. Mayer of Princeton University ... popularizes the nonsense that the Nazis saw in Marxism and bolshevism their main enemy, and the Jews unfortunately got caught up in this; when he links the destruction of the Jews to the ups and downs of German warfare in the Soviet Union, in a book that is so cocksure of itself that it does not need a proper scientific apparatus, he is really engaging in a much more subtle form of Holocaust denial. He in effect denies the motivation for murder and flies in the face of well-known documentation.\"\nMuch of the controversy around \"Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?\" was due to the simple fact that through this book the general public first learned of the functionalist view that there was no masterplan for the Holocaust going back to the days when Hitler wrote \"Mein Kampf.\"\n\nAnother area of controversy centered on what Robert Jan van Pelt called Mayer's \"well-meant but ill-considered reflection on the causes of death in Auschwitz\". Mayer concluded his reflection as follows: \"certainly at Auschwitz, but probably overall, more Jews were killed by so-called 'natural' causes than by 'unnatural' ones.\" This conclusion removed the lingering restraints—if any actually remained—preventing David Irving from publicly announcing he did not believe the gas chambers at Nazi camps like Auschwitz existed. Guttenplan called Mayer's musing on differences between 'natural' and 'unnatural' deaths, even if the terms were deployed in quote marks, \"indefensible\".\n\nHolocaust deniers have often quoted out of context Mayer's sentences in the book: \"Sources for the study of the gas chambers are at once rare and unreliable\". As the authors Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman have noted, the entire paragraph from which the sentence comes from states that the SS destroyed the majority of the documention relating to the operation of the gas chambers in the death camps, which is why Mayer feels that sources for the operation of the gas chambers are \"rare\" and \"unreliable\".\n\nMayer has been critical of the policies of the United States government. In 2001, after the September 11 attacks, he wrote an essay stating that \"since 1947 America has been the chief and pioneering perpetrator of 'preemptive' state terror, exclusively in the Third World and therefore widely dissembled.\" When interviewed for a 2003 documentary, he described the Roman Empire as a \"tea party\" in comparison to its American counterpart.\n\nMayer's book, \"Plowshares into Swords\" (2008) is an anti-Zionist and pro-Palestinian account of Israeli history, tracing what Mayer regards as the degradation of Jewry in general and Zionism in particular in face of what Mayer sees as Israeli colonial aggression against the Palestinians. In a largely favorable review, the British writer Geoffrey Wheatcroft called \"Plowshares into Swords\" an enlightening account of Israeli history that traces such figures as Martin Buber, Judah Magnes, Yeshayahu Leibowitz and, perhaps unexpectedly, Vladimir Jabotinsky and critiques the \"chauvinistic and brutalising tendencies of Zionism\". In a negative review of the book, British scholar Simon Goldhill said it was of little value as history and criticized Mayer for his political bias, arguing that Mayer ignored Arab acts and media rhetoric against Jewish settlers and Israelis, falsely portrayed the Six-Day War in 1967 as a \"calculated imperialist plot\", claimed that all Western criticism of the Islamic world for human rights issues is nothing more than self-interested and described Arab feeling toward Jews buying property in Palestine in the 1920s as \"righteous anger\".\n\n\n\n"}

They were conceived in 1961 by V. K. Krishna Menon, the then Defence Minister of India, to rectify the regional and class imbalance amongst the Officer cadre of the Indian Military, and to prepare students for entry into the National Defence Academy (NDA), Khadakwasla, Pune and Indian Naval Academy. Today there are 33 such schools running and proposed for future covering all the states of the country.\n\nThe schools come under the purview of respective state governments and Ministry of Defence, and in his Union Budget of 2008, Finance minister, P Chidambaram, allocated 2 crore to each of the 25 Sainik schools, to counter rising attrition in the defence forces, especially at the officer level. The first Sainik School was opened by Dr Sampoorna Nand in UP in 1960 under UP state government and there after other Sainik schools we’re opened. UP Sainik School Lucknow located near Amausi Airport remains the only Sainik School under State Govt.\n\nThe inspiration for Sainik Schools came from the Rashtriya Indian Military College (RIMC) which have given India many service chiefs and the public school system of England. Sainik schools can be regarded as the ordinary citizen's public school where deserving students can get high quality education irrespective of their income or class background. Seats are reserved for children of serving Defence personnel and concessions are given to children of Government officials. Although Uttar Pradesh Sainik School Lucknow, established in 1960 was the first one of such kind, it is not under the Sainik School Society, but rather under Uttar Pradesh Sainik Schools Society, which is registered under the Indian Societies Registration Act (1860)\n\nThe objective of the Sainik Schools is to prepare the students to lead as officers in the Defence Services of the country. The schools select bright and promising students through a national entrance examination and focus on moulding their overall personality with emphasis on extracurricular activities.\n\nSainik schools resources allow cadets to develop their skills in sports, academics and other extracurricular activities. Sainik Schools include running tracks, cross-country tracks, indoor games, parade grounds, boxing rings, firing ranges, canoeing clubs, horse riding clubs, mountaineering clubs, trekking and hiking club, obstacles courses, football, hockey and cricket fields, as well as volleyball and basketball courts. Cadets also become a part of NCC. A cadet who complete their 12th standard usually possess a NCC B certificate.\n\nCadets are assigned to houses. They are classified as sub-juniors, juniors and seniors respectively depending upon their class of study. Cadets compete in sports, physical training, academics, cross country, drill and various other competitions to win their house trophy.\n\nThe Sainik Schools Society is an organization under the Ministry of Defence. The Chief Executive Body of the Sainik Schools Society is a Board of Governors functioning under the Chairmanship of the Defence Minister. For exercising closer control and supervision over the affairs of Sainik Schools there is an Executive Committee under the Chairmanship of Defence Secretary. The day-to-day work of the Society is managed by Dir (Trg) & Hony Secy who is assisted by Inspecting Officers, Under Secretary, Sainik Schools Society (Sainik School Cell). The staff for the cell is provided by the MoD. The local administration of the school is looked after by a Local Board of Administration whose Chairman is the GoC-in-C of the concerned Command where the Sainik School is located.\n\nSainik School Lucknow was established in July 1960. The only one of the Sainik Schools to be administered by the state government, the alumni of which, Captain Manoj Pandey, posthumously received Param Veer Chakra. It was the first Sainik School in the country, and was followed by the setting up of other Sainik Schools, under the Ministry of Defence, Government of India, on the same lines. The education in this school is subsidised by the Government of Uttar Pradesh. It is a boys' residential English medium school affiliated to CBSE Board.\n\nThe school is run by the Uttar Pradesh Sainik Schools Society, which is registered under the Indian Societies Registration Act (1860). It is the only Sainik School which is completely financed and managed by the State Government.\n\n\n\n37.Sainik School Entrance Exam Syllabus Careerfiesta. April 2020\n\n"}

It was released for the Virtual Boy on March 22, 1996 in North America. Players control multiple falling blocks, rotating and positioning them to clear layers in a three-dimensional environment similar to \"Tetris\"s gameplay. The game contains multiple modes and game types, as well as different difficulty settings and levels. Parts of \"3D Tetris\" are rendered as 3D wire-frame models. A version of the game entitled was to be released in February 1996 in Japanese markets, but never emerged. The game received mostly negative reviews with critics panning it for a lack of originality.\n\n\"3D Tetris\" is a puzzle game that uses a three-dimensional playing field as opposed to the traditional two dimensions used in most other versions of \"Tetris\". The game contains multiple different modes: 3-D Tetris, Center-Fill, and Puzzle, each having different game types. Players can modify the difficulty in these modes as well as the blocks fall. The play field, called a well, contains 5 vertical layers that players fill with falling three-dimensional blocks. These blocks can be rotated horizontally and vertically, as well as positioned in four different directions. Each block displays a shadow underneath it which indicates where it will land. The game's camera continually adjusts itself, but players can manually readjust it. Each mode's HUD displays a radar which provides information about each of the Well's five layers, as well as the next block to fall, which is represented by a character. In the 3-D Tetris mode, a layer disappears when it's filled with blocks, scoring players points which are displayed in the HUD. If blocks stack over the top of the well, the number of layers will go down by one. The game is over when the final layer is lost. One game mode is based on accumulating points, while the other mode requires players to complete multiple levels by clearing all five layers in each. \n\nIn the Center-Fill mode, players place blocks in symmetrical patterns around center blocks placed in each well's layers. If a block is placed in a layer's center block, it disappears, and any other blocks in the layer will also disappear if they have been successfully placed in a symmetrical pattern. Points are gained based on the number of blocks in, the complexity of, and the height of the symmetrical layer. A symmetrical pattern is indicated by a symbol shown in the HUD's radar, as well as the player's score. Like the 3-D Tetris mode, layers will be lost if the blocks go over the top of the well, and the game ends when all layers are lost. One game type requires players to complete as many layers as possible, while the other is the same except with obstacles added. The game type Clear It! requires players to clear ten symmetrical layers on each stage to progress to the next stage. In the Puzzle mode, a shape is displayed in the well at the beginning of each stage. Players are tasked with getting to the highest stage possible by placing blocks in the displayed shape to progress to the next stage. At the end of each stage, a stage-ending animation is displayed. If an incorrect shape is placed, the game ends. \"3D Tetris\" includes an option to save high scores and names entered from the 3-D Tetris and Center-Fill modes, along with progress in the Puzzle mode, to a battery backup.\n\n\"3D Tetris\" was developed by T&E Soft for release in the United States. A version was planned for Japanese markets entitled , which was to be released in February 1996, but was never released.\n\nLike all other Virtual Boy games, \"3D Tetris\" uses a red-and-black color scheme and uses parallax, an optical trick that is used to simulate a 3D effect. The game contains 30 different block types, and renders each one as a 3D wire-frame model until they fall to the bottom of the well, where they are filled in. It was the last game released on the Virtual Boy in North America.\n\n\"3D Tetris\" received mostly negative reviews. Aaron Curtiss, writing for the \"Los Angeles Times\", said that \"3D Tetris\" \"adds nothing to the original and leaves players feeling cheated\". He criticized the control scheme and brushed off the 3D effects as somewhat superfluous. His called the graphics \"vector graphic with some shading\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" had even harsher criticism, calling it a \"logy, eye-straining, desperate-to-please variant\" of the \"Blockout\" game that came before it. A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" panned the game, saying it \"epitomizes the problems inherent in the Virtual Boy itself.\" He elaborated that while the cartridge includes three game variations, all three are ill-advised reworkings of the \"Tetris\" concept which lack the simple elegance of the original game, and all three are hampered by a 3D perspective which frequently blocks the player's view. A reviewer for magazine \"VideoGames\" felt that putting \"Tetris\" in 3D did not add value to the game and made a \"simple concept\" less appealing. The reviewer felt however that the 3D was done well, and that the perspective added \"intrigue and difficulty\". \"GamePro\"s \"Scary Larry\" felt that the sound and visuals were nondescript, and that the controls were frustrating, while noting that it's still addictive. \"Game Informer\" considered a 3-dimensional \"Tetris\" game a \"good idea,\" but called this attempt \"fairly boring,\" and wished it had a faster pace. A writer for \"Nintendo Power\" stated that the game has a user-friendly button configuration that is \"easy to master\". Jeremy Parish felt it was a knockoff of the video game \"Blockout\" and that it was not fun. He cited the visuals and a gameplay style that finds no middleground between being too complicated and too slow.\n\nIn a retrospective review, \"USgamer\" writer Jaz Rignall suggested that the game was \"about as much fun as getting pepper sprayed in the face\". GamesRadar+ editor Brett Elston felt that \"3D Tetris\" visuals were \"appalling\" and commented that he couldn't understand what was happening due to the poor visuals. He felt that if it was remade for the 3DS and done better, it would be better than \"Tetrisphere\" (another 3D \"Tetris\" game).\n\nMark Long, CEO of Zombie Studios, preferred \"3D Tetris\" to \"Tetris\" on the Game Boy, and considered it the best game for the Virtual Boy.\n\n"}

A man of towering stature, at tall and , Green achieved notoriety for his blunt manner. He possessed a booming voice and achieved many successes over a baseball career that lasted over 60 years.\n\nAfter his career as a pitcher, minor league manager, and farm system director, Green went on to manage the Phillies, New York Yankees and Mets for all or portions of eight seasons between and . He led the Phillies to their third-ever National League pennant and the first World Series title in their 97-year history in 1980, when they defeated the Kansas City Royals.\n\nAs general manager of the Chicago Cubs from to , Green built the club that won a division title in 1984 — the Cubs' first postseason appearance in 39 years.\n\nGreen had a losing record both as a pitcher and as a manager; nonetheless, in 1983, he was inducted into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame.\n\nGreen was born in Newport, Delaware. He was the middle of three children. Green graduated from Conrad High School, and attended the University of Delaware. He played as a pitcher and right fielder for the Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens baseball team and was a two-year letterman in basketball for Delaware. After Green pitched to a 6–0 win–loss record and an 0.88 earned run average (ERA) in , his junior year, Jocko Collins, a scout for the Philadelphia Phillies, signed Green as an amateur free agent.\n\nGreen made his major league debut with the Phillies in 1960.

When Green was appointed to the position, he matter-of-factly stated: \"I express my thoughts. I'm a screamer, a yeller, and a cusser. I never hold back.\" Green was notorious for his liberal use of profanity. His difficult manner led to clashes with many of the team's star players, such as slugger Greg Luzinski, shortstop Larry Bowa, and catcher Bob Boone. Titanic blows were exchanged between 6 ft, 5 in Green and 6 ft, 6 in (1.98 m) relief pitcher Ron Reed. Still, come October, it was Green manning the helm, guiding the Phillies to victory, in the 1980 World Series — the team’s \"first\" World Series title in its 98-year history. Through , he managed Philadelphia to a 169–130 record. In 1981, the team again made the postseason, by virtue of having won the East division, in the first half of the strike-split season; however, the Phillies lost to the Montreal Expos in the National League Division Series, 3 games to 2.\n\nFollowing the Tribune Company's purchase of the Chicago Cubs from the Wrigley family in 1981, the company hired Green away from Philadelphia after the season as executive vice president and general manager. His presence was quickly felt in the organization, as his slogan \"Building a New Tradition\" was a jab at the Cubs' history of losing. Green hired a number of coaches and scouts away from the Phillies, such as Lee Elia, John Vukovich, and Gordon Goldsberry. Green also made some trades with the Phillies, acquiring players such as Bowa, Keith Moreland, Dickie Noles, and Ryne Sandberg.\n\nGreen continued to build the Cubs between the and seasons. After acquiring left fielder Gary Matthews and center fielder Bob Dernier from Philadelphia, before the season, Green's Cubs became serious contenders for the first time in more than a decade. During the 1984 season, Green made a few more moves, most notably acquiring right-handed pitcher Dennis Eckersley from the Boston Red Sox for popular first baseman Bill Buckner in late May, and sending Cubs' prospects Mel Hall and Joe Carter to the Cleveland Indians for relief pitcher George Frazier, backup catcher Ron Hassey, and right-handed pitcher Rick Sutcliffe, in mid-June. Sutcliffe went 16–1 with the Cubs that season to lead the Cubs to the National League East title — their first postseason appearance of any kind since the 1945 World Series. Because Green neglected to renew waivers on Hall and Carter, the status of the trade was in doubt for a while, and the two did not play for a week. Green's first-year manager Jim Frey won NL Manager of the Year, Sutcliffe won the NL Cy Young Award, and Sandberg won the NL Most Valuable Player Award. Green was named \"The Sporting News\" Executive of the Year. Green then won a power struggle within the Cubs front office; he was promoted to team president, replacing Jim Finks, who resigned to take a job with the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League.\n\nAs it turned out, this was the high point of Green's tenure in Chicago. The Cubs struggled in and , and fell to last place in 1987. After Green blasted the Cubs for quitting in 1987, manager Gene Michael resigned over Labor Day weekend. Green himself left the Cubs in October 1987, citing \"philosophical differences\" with Tribune Company executives.\n\nGreen was the first Cubs executive to clash with the city of Chicago over the installation of lights in Wrigley Field. Green was a strong proponent of lights from the start of his tenure, but a city ordinance prohibited the Cubs from installing lights in the residential Lakeview neighborhood, where Wrigley Field was located. As Green saw it, the issue was not lights or no lights, but stay at Wrigley Field or move to the suburbs. Bluntly stating that \"if there are no lights in Wrigley Field, there will be no Wrigley Field,\" he threatened to move the Cubs to a new stadium in northwest suburban Schaumburg or Arlington Heights. He also considered shutting down Wrigley Field for a year and playing at Comiskey Park as tenants of the Chicago White Sox, in hopes that the loss of revenue would temper or eliminate neighborhood opposition. Green's stance changed the context of the debate, as even the staunchest opponents of installing lights did not want to be held responsible for the Cubs leaving town. Shortly before Green's departure, the Chicago City Council and Mayor Harold Washington approved a change to the ordinance, allowing the Cubs to install lights in 1988. Green also rebuilt the Cubs' farm system with Goldsberry, developing stars like Shawon Dunston, Greg Maddux, Rafael Palmeiro, Jamie Moyer, and Mark Grace. The Cubs won a division title in .\n\nAfter the season, the New York Yankees fired manager Lou Piniella, replacing him with Green. With the 1989 Yankees, he was also under .500 at 56–65 (.463). The team had finished nine games over .500 the prior year, but fell to nine games under .500 during Green's tenure. Green insulted team owner George Steinbrenner by referring to him as \"Manager George\" for his meddling with the team. Steinbrenner fired Green, in August 1989.\n\nIn , the New York Mets hired Green as a scout. During the season, the Mets fired manager Jeff Torborg, and hired Green for the position. During his tenure with the Mets, he was under .500 at 229–283 (.447). The Mets fired Green in , replacing him with Bobby Valentine. \n\nIn , Green returned to the Phillies as a senior advisor to the General Manager. He would remain with the Philadelphia organization, serving in various capacities, for the remainder of his life.\n\nGreen's overall managerial record was 454–478, a .487 winning percentage.\n\nOn January 31, 1958, Green married Sylvia Lowe Taylor at Calvary United Presbyterian Church in Hayden Park, Delaware. The couple had four children, and remained married until his death.\n\nGreen's nine-year-old granddaughter, Christina Taylor-Green, was killed in the 2011 Tucson shooting that critically wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Her interest in government prompted a neighbor to take her to the event with the congresswoman. Green, after receiving the news of his granddaughter's death, said that this was the worst thing that has ever happened to his family.\n\nHis son, John Green, Christina's father, is a supervisor of amateur scouts (east coast) and is currently working for the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nOn March 22, 2017, Green died at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. He had spent the previous month at the hospital on dialysis due to kidney failure. Green’s death resulted from the kidney failure, complicated with pneumonia.\n\nThe Phillies wore a patch on their uniform sleeves, featuring a capital D with the team's 70s- and 80s-era “baseball inside the P” logo — the one used during his tenure as the team’s skipper — in the middle color area, featuring the team's colors, red and white, in a black circle, during the season, in his memory.\n\n"}

Dempster batted and threw right-handed. He was both a starter and a reliever, in his career.\n\nOn April 22, 2014, Dempster was hired by MLB Network as a studio color analyst.\n\nHe was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 3rd round of the 1995 MLB draft and began his career with the Gulf Coast Rangers. He subsequently played for the Hudson Valley Renegades, the Kane County Cougars and the Charleston RiverDogs. Dempster was traded to the Florida Marlins on August 8, 1996 (with Rick Helling) for John Burkett.\n\nDempster made his major league debut for the Marlins, working two innings of relief, on May 23, 1998 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, allowing three earned runs on two hits in that game. He later made his first start on June 1 against the Chicago Cubs, lasting only 1 1/3 innings as he was shelled for five runs while allowing 4 hits (including 2 home runs) and walking 3, to record his first career loss. After falling to 0–3 he got his first Major League win on June 28 against the Boston Red Sox, when he allowed only 1 run in 7 innings. He was 1–5 with a 7.08 ERA in 14 appearances (11 starts) that season. He started 25 games in 1999 and finished 7–8 with a 4.71 ERA.\n\nIn 2000, Dempster was 13–10 with a 3.66 ERA in 33 starts, including 2 complete games and 1 shutout. On May 7, 2000, he tossed a one-hitter against the New York Mets. He was selected to the 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. His stats slipped a bit in 2001 as he went 15–12 with a 4.94 ERA in 34 starts. In 2002, he made 18 starts for the Marlins and was 5–8 with a 4.79 ERA.\n\nThe Marlins traded Dempster to the Cincinnati Reds on July 11, 2002 for Juan Encarnación, Wilton Guerrero and Ryan Snare. In 15 starts the second half of the season, he was 5–5 with a 6.19 ERA.\n\nIn the 2003 season, he made 20 starts (and 2 relief appearances) and was 3-7 with a 6.54 ERA. In August 2003, he underwent Tommy John surgery on his right elbow and missed the rest of the season.\n\nAfter his release by the Reds, he signed as a free agent with the Chicago Cubs on January 21, 2004. After rehabbing from his surgery, he joined the Cubs on August 1 and appeared in 23 games, all out of the bullpen. He picked up his first career save on September 15, 2004 against the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nIn , after starting 6 games, Dempster was named the closer for the Cubs, replacing LaTroy Hawkins.\n\nHe collected 33 saves in 35 opportunities, the best save percentage in the league; in both blown saves, he collected the win. He is the only Cub and one of just three players ever to both start a game and collect 30 saves in the same season. On October 1, 2005, the Cubs signed him through 2008 in a US$15.5 million contract extension.\nHe emerged as one of the team's most consistent relievers in . At one point, Lou Piniella, the Cubs' manager, was considering promoting Dempster to a starting pitcher. However, the idea was short lived, as a struggling bullpen forced Dempster to remain as closer. He recorded 16 saves in 18 opportunities before missing two weeks of playtime on account of an injured oblique muscle.\n\nDuring 2008 spring training, Dempster's performance resulted in his being designated to the third spot on the starting rotation, with the closer job going to Kerry Wood. On April 3, 2008, he earned his first win as a home starter since a 2002 win with the Marlins against the Cubs. On May 15, 2008, Dempster recorded a career high 12 strikeouts in a game. He pitched 8rd innings, and gave up only 6 hits. On July 8, 2008 he became the first Cubs pitcher in 31 seasons to start 10–0 at home. Dempster finished the season with 17–6 record, with 2.96 ERA and 183 strikeouts in 201 and 2/3 innings. Dempster threw sliders 32.9% of the time in 2008, more than any other NL starting pitcher.\n\nDempster opened the Cubs 2008 postseason campaign against the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 26, 2008.\nDempster accumulated a high pitch count early and, after he was unable to get outs with 0–2 counts twice, he surrendered a grand slam to James Loney and was pulled in favor of Sean Marshall.\n\nHe led the majors in sacrifice hits, with 19.\n\nFollowing the 2008 season, Dempster re-signed with the Cubs for four years and a reported $52 million.\n\nIn May 2009 MLB indicated that the Commissioner's Office would review Dempster's up-and-in pitch to Milwaukee Brewers slugger Ryan Braun. Cubs manager Lou Piniella commented, \"You've got to tie Braun up from time to time. If you don't, he's going to feast on you.\" After reviewing the tapes, however, Major League Baseball found no wrongdoing on Dempster's part, and decided not to take any action against him.\n\nDempster finished the season with a 3.65 ERA and a record of 11–9 in 31 starts.\n\nIn 2010, he was 15–12 with a 3.85 ERA in 34 starts and in 2011 he was 10–14 with a 4.80 ERA in 34 starts.\n\nOn July 31, 2012 Dempster was traded to Texas at the trade deadline, for minor leaguers Christian Villanueva and Kyle Hendricks. He made his Rangers debut on August 2, 2012. Dempster had a 5.09 ERA with a 7–3 record in 12 games. He pitched 69 innings and had 70 strikeouts with the Rangers.\n\nDempster signed a two-year contract worth $26.5 million with the Boston Red Sox after the 2012 season.\nHe is tied for the most regular season grand slams allowed (11) with Kenny Rogers. Dempster has also allowed one in the postseason, for a grand total of 12.\n\nOn August 18, 2013, in a game against the rival New York Yankees, Dempster was involved in a contentious incident with Alex Rodriguez. The first time he faced Rodriguez, he threw one pitch behind him, then subsequently, Dempster's 3–0 pitch struck Rodriguez on the left elbow pad and ricocheted off his back. Although home plate umpire Brian O'Nora warned Dempster and both dugouts, Dempster was allowed to stay in the game. Later, in the top of the 6th inning, Dempster gave up a home run to Rodriguez and the Red Sox lost the game 9-6. On August 20, MLB gave Dempster a five-game suspension (though he did not miss a start) and an undisclosed fine for hitting Rodriguez. For a couple of years following the incident, Dempster claimed he did not mean to hit Rodriguez then finally admitted in August 2016 the incident was, indeed, intentional.\n\nDempster finished the 2013 season at 8–9 with a 4.57 ERA in 32 games (29 starts). He was part of the 25-man active roster for the postseason making 3 relief appearances and won his first championship title when the Red Sox beat the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2013 World Series.\n\nOn February 16, 2014, Dempster announced he would not pitch in 2014, stating that he wanted to spend some time with his family. The Red Sox placed Dempster on the restricted list for the 2014 season. His salary for 2014 was $13.25 million, but was never paid or granted due to his absence.\n\nOn October 8, 2014, Dempster announced his retirement. On December 5, it was announced that Dempster would be taking a job in the Cubs' front office as an assistant to general manager Jed Hoyer and president of baseball operations Theo Epstein.\n\nIn January 2017, Dempster indicated he would pitch for Team Canada in the 2017 World Baseball Classic. He started two games for Canada in the Classic, pitching a total of only 2⅓ innings while giving up 7 earned runs.\n\nDempster threw five pitches with some regularity: a four-seam fastball and two-seam fastball averaging about 90 mph, a cut fastball in the high 80s, a slider in the mid 80s, and a splitter in the low 80s. Dempster favored his slider over his splitter when throwing to right-handed hitters and often imparted an obvious, prolonged wiggle to his glove as part of his windup, a move he claims is done in order to prevent tipping opposing batters to his pitches.\n\nDempster is widely known for his laid-back attitude, constantly joking with fans and teammates, and is said to be a positive contribution to a team's clubhouse. Dempster's fun and easy-going personality was especially evident when, in comments to an Arizona newspaper in March 2007, Dempster stated that if his career as a closer began to tumble, he would pursue ninja training.\nIn early June 2009, Dempster released a statement explaining that his daughter, Riley Dempster, had DiGeorge Syndrome, also known as Velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS), 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and Shprintzen syndrome (after Dr. Robert Shprintzen who identified it in 1978). About 1 baby in 1800 is born with this genetic deletion which ubiquitously affects swallowing, breathing, and speech. Dempster did this because he wanted to help raise awareness of this genetic disease. When asked if she would lead a normal life, he replied, \"Yeah, she will. There can be (problems), but so far all the signs are good. There's a lot of work to do. They say there are 186 symptoms you can have. You just check off ones as you go along.\" After roughly 2 months in the hospital, Riley was able to go home in early June.\n\n\n"}

In France it set a record by staying at number-one for 20 weeks. The song reached number 3 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on 2 November 1999, giving Bega his only top-40 hit in the United States.\n\nWith its worldwide success, the song became the subject of a seven-year copyright trial between Prado's estate, Peermusic, and Bega's producers. Bega had only used riffs (which by German law cannot be registered for copyright) from Prado's original and written the entire lyrics, so Bega's producers went to court in order to gain access to all the song's proceedings from Peermusic representing Prado's estate. However, after seven years the Federal Court of Justice of Germany ruled in favor of Peermusic and Prado's estate in 2008, based upon the fact that Bega's producers had sought a royalty agreement with Peermusic prior to releasing the song. Because of Bega's significant contributions to his version, the court's final ruling declared it a new song co-written by Prado and Bega.\n\nThe music video, directed by Jorn Heitmann, features Lou Bega singing and dancing with flappers. An alternate music video aired on the Disney Channel, featuring clips from various Disney films and television series, with newly recorded lyrics by Bega dealing with the featured characters.\n\nCD single\n\nMaxi single\n\n7\" 45 rpm single\n\nIn 2001, BBC Records released a novelty version of the song sung by British actor Neil Morrissey, who provided the voice for the children's television show \"Bob the Builder\". This cover made radical changes to the lyrics to fit the theme of the show, making numerous references to construction, repairs and roadway maintenance, as well as the show's characters, who provide background vocals. The female names from Bega's version are also replaced with types of construction supplies and building tasks (e.g. timber, saw, waterproofing, tiling).\n\nOn 9 September 2001, the song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Bob the Builder's second number-one single on the listing after \"Can We Fix It?\". It earned a Gold certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 12 October 2001 for shipping over 400,000 units. At the end of 2001, it was ranked as the UK's 17th-best-selling single.\n\nIn Ireland, the song first appeared on the Irish Singles Chart at number 13 on 13 September and peaked at number four the following week, staying there for three weeks in total. It remained in the top 50 for the next 10 weeks. At the end of the year, the song came in at number 42 on Ireland's year-end chart.\n\nIn Australia, \"Mambo No. 5\" debuted at number three on the ARIA Singles Chart on 4 November 2001 and reached number two on 18 November, held off the top spot by Alien Ant Farm's cover of \"Smooth Criminal\". After staying at number two for another week, the song began to descend the chart, spending nine more weeks in the top 50. It was Australia's 26th-most-successful hit of the year and shipped over 70,000 copies, allowing it to receive a Platinum certification from ARIA.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Together with his brother-in-law, Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, Director influenced some of the next generation of jurists, including Robert Bork, Richard Posner, Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice William Rehnquist.\n\nDirector was born in Staryi Chortoryisk, Volhynian Governorate, Russian Empire (now in Ukraine) on September 21, 1901. In 1913, he and his family immigrated to the United States, and settled in Portland, Oregon. In Portland, Director attended Lincoln High School where he edited the yearbook. Director had a difficult childhood in Portland, then a center of KKK and anti-communist hysteria in the wake of World War I. He encountered anti-Semitic slurs and was excluded from social circles. He then moved east to attend Yale University in Connecticut, where his friend, artist Mark Rothko also attended. He graduated in 1924 after three years of study. While at Yale, Director was influenced by Thorstein Veblen and H.L. Mencken, both elitist academics who believed the public lacked the intelligence to make democracy successful, and he eventually came to hold these views as well. He and Rothko anonymously published a satirical newspaper called the \"Saturday Evening Pest\" in which he wrote “the definition of the United States shall eternally be H. L. Mencken surrounded by 112,000,000 morons” and called for an \"aristocracy of the mentally alert and curious. In 1926, he returned to Portland where he was hired to run and teach at the Portland Labor College. As a radical, his invitations to Communists and Wobblies created friction with the AFL craft unions which sponsored the College. In working with these radical groups, Director developed his sense that individuals, especially elites were better equipped to affect social change than government. The fall of 1927 he entered Graduate School at the University of Chicago with a fellow-ship, where he combined his radicalism to a lifelong conservative ideology. His sister, the economist Rose Director Friedman, married Milton Friedman in 1938. During World War II, he held positions in the War Department and the Department of Commerce.\n\nNobel laureate Austrian economist and political theorist Friedrich Hayek, who was then a professor of economics at Chicago; was close to Director. They met in England and Director convinced the University of Chicago Press to publish Hayek's \"Road to Serfdom\" in the United States as part of the so-called Free Market Study which they and economist Henry Simons led\".\" Hayek actively promoted Director in helping to fund and establish the Law and Society program in the Law School. Hayek convinced Missouri businessman Harold Luhnow, head of the Volker Fund, a foundation in Kansas City, to provide the funding. Luhnow also funded Director's University of Chicago salary for five years, a rare occurrence for the university.\n\nAt the University of Chicago, Director completed his transition to conservative corporatist. The Free Market Study had at first centered on Simons's traditional conservative antimonopoly politics, but his death in 1946 opened the door for a more radical conservatism. In 1950, Director still held some of Simons's economic philosophy, and as a result, Lunhow threatened to remove him from the Free Market Study. During this period of the 1940s and 1950s, Director broke away from traditional conservative politics, instead combining it with the social skepticism he had learned from Thorstein and Veblen and the elitism he developed in Portland.\n\nDirector's appointment to the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School in 1946 began a half-century of intellectual productivity, although his reluctance about publishing left few writings behind. Director taught antitrust courses at the law school with Edward Levi, who was later Dean of Chicago's Law School, President of the University of Chicago, and U.S. Attorney General in the Ford administration.\n\nIn 1953, Director became the head of a new study called the Antitrust Project which aimed to restructure American antitrust law. The project coincided with the period in which Director broke from traditional conservative ideas and fused them with the elitism of Veblen and Mencken. He argued that private monopolies only emerged as a result of government action, without which, they would cease to be a problem. This shift helped turn the focus of the Chicago school of economics towards rebuilding corporate power. \n\nDirector used a two-part strategy to help build up the Chicago school. First, he recruited scholars as well as funding for their research. Second, he had them use Mencken's framework of mocking targets as ignorant and elitist. Two of the first converts to Director's neoliberal school were Friedman and George Stigler, scholars from the older, classically liberal Chicago conservative tradition. Friedman and Stigler were still anti-monopolist, but over the course of the 1950s, Director convinced them that monopolies would cease to be a problem under the neoliberal framework. From then on, Director served as the \"ideological enforcer\" of the new Chicago school with Friedman crafting the rhetoric and Stigler driving the economic vision. Through Director's Chicago school framework, scholars like Friedman and Stigler made their first advances into public-policy advocacy\n\nDirector's greatest contribution to the Chicago school lay in his ability to recruit and convert scholars to the school's neoliberal doctrine. Some of his students compared taking his antitrust or economics courses to a religious conversion with Nobel laureate Ronald Coase joking that “I regarded my role as that of Saint Paul to Aaron Director’s Christ. He got the doctrine going, and what I had to do was bring it to the gentiles.\" Rather than penning the great works of the Chicago school himself, he was, according to former University of Chicago Law School dean Paul Baird \"a teacher of teachers.\" \n\nDirector founded the \"Journal of Law & Economics\" in 1958, which he co-edited with Coase, that helped to unite the fields of law and economics with far-reaching influence. In 1962, he helped to found the Committee on a Free Society. Behind the law and economics movement lay the narrative of scientific consensus. The Chicago school was not the first group to show interest in empirical economics but they used the language of science as a strong rhetorical tool. Director viewed human nature deterministically so he argued that the law could be replaced by the scientific principles of economics through efficiency measurements.\n\nThe work of Director and his students fundamentally altered public discourse around issues of economics. In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower said of those who opposed the reforms of the New Deal \"their number is negligible and they are stupid\" By 1964, Director students including Robert Bork were working on Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign. At that time, the Chicago school was not yet the dominant force in political discourse, but in ten years, it had gone from being \"negligible\" to being a significant opposition to the majority. In 1973, Bork was appointed as Solicitor General of the United States by President Richard Nixon. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court had begun striking down antitrust legal precedents. In just two decades, Director and his students had brought the Chicago school from obscurity to a major intellectual force in American politics. \n\nAfter retiring from the University of Chicago Law School in 1965, Director relocated to California and took a position at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. He died September 11, 2004, at his home in Los Altos Hills, California, ten days shy of his 103rd birthday. \n\n\n"}

It lies within the metropolitan borough of South Tyneside, roughly halfway between South Shields and Sunderland, in the ceremonial county of Tyne and Wear. Historically part of County Durham, the village has a population of 5,235.\n\nThe origin of the name is not entirely clear. While the \"Whit\" component almost certainly derives from the Old English word \"hwit\" meaning \"white\", the origin of the \"burn\" component is disputed. It may come from the Northern English term \"burn\" meaning a stream, or it may be a corruption of \"barn\". A record of the name as \"Wituberne\" in 1182 adds little clarity.\n\nWhitburn is listed in the \"Boldon buke\" of 1183 as \"Whitbern\" and was probably an Anglo-Saxon settlement.\n\nFollowing the attack of the Spanish Armada on England in 1588, the vanquished Spanish fleet fled up the east coasts of England and Scotland. Two Spanish galleons ran aground on Whitburn Rocks in rough seas and local inhabitants plundered the wreckage. The bell from one of the galleons was placed in Whitburn Church. Spanish oak beams removed from the shipwrecks could still be viewed in the roof of the Whitburn lawnmower shop in the 1950s prior to the building's demolition.\n\nWhitburn remained fairly undisturbed settlement until 1718 when the Land Enclosure Act came into force and a number of farms were created. The settlement was isolated as no roads connected to it, but there was a path on Sea Lane (now East Street) connecting it to Whitburn Bents, a nearby hamlet. Not until 1866 was a road built over the sandunes to Fulwell, in northern Sunderland. In 1874 Marsden Pit was sunk and the community increased dramatically as a result. Whitburn Colliery closed in 1968, and the land is now a coastal park and nature reserve.\n\nWhitburn has retained its village character, with its main street, parish church, cricket ground and park with bowling greens and tennis courts.\n\nIt is generally accepted that Lewis Carroll wrote \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\" while holidaying at his cousins' house in Whitburn. A statue of Carroll is in the library.\nWhitburn windmill, dating from the 18th century, is a local landmark. Durham County Council, which covered the South Tyneside area until 1974, took ownership of the mill in 1960 from the Church Commissioners. The building is listed (Grade II) as it is considered to be of special architectural and historical importance and is protected therefore by the requirements of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. In 1991/1992 South Tyneside Council undertook a restoration project of the mill, including restoration of the sails, for which it was awarded the Civic Trust Award.\n\nThere are three schools in Whitburn – Whitburn Village Primary School, Marsden Primary School and Whitburn Church of England Academy (formerly Whitburn Comprehensive School).\n\nTo the north of the village, near Marsden village, is Whitburn Coastal Park, near which is cared for by the National Trust team based at the Souter Lighthouse. This recreation area is a popular haunt for birdwatchers. A sea-watching observatory is used mainly by Durham Bird Club members, who monitor seabird and wildfowl migration throughout the year (activity peaks during July–November), but is open to all bird-watchers. Keys (£12) can be bought at the National Trust shop at Souter Lighthouse but the observatory is normally in use whenever seabird and wildfowl passage is in progress which means it can be accessed by bird-watchers without keys. Whitburn is one of the premier sites on the east coast of England for seawatching with notable list of rarities to its name.

Marie, Ontario, Canada. The mill was situated on the St. Marys River waterfront, just east of Essar Steel Algoma.\n\nThe pulp mill was originally established as the \"Sault Ste. Marie Pulp and Paper Company\" in 1895 by Francis Clergue. It was located on the site of a Northwest Company trading post that was established in 1874.\n\nClergue also incorporated the \"Ontario Pulp and Paper Company\" to operate a parallel mill for newsprint production.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Clergue industrial empire in 1903, it closed for several months before being operated in receivership until 1905. The Clergue companies became part of the Lake Superior Corporation in 1904, which arranged for the transfer of the assets of the Sault Ste. Marie Pulp and Paper Company to the Lake Superior Paper Company Ltd. in 1911. Lake Superior Paper amalgamated with Spanish River Pulp & Paper Mills in 1917, which operated the mill until the Abitibi Power and Paper Company purchased it in 1928.\n\nThe mill was acquired by St Marys Paper Inc. from Abitibi in 1984, for which loan guarantees were secured from the Government of Canada. St Marys Paper was controlled by a private investor, Dan Alexander, who arranged to invest heavily in a fifth paper machine.\n\nSt. Mary's Paper operated a supercalendar grade paper mill with three paper machines, with a total annual capacity of 240,000 tons.\n\nIt produced SCA premium, SCA and SCB paper grades under the trade names \"Sequence\", \"Sequel\" and \"Synpress\". Paper produced at the mill was primarily purchased by magazine publishers and large retail companies for high quality advertising inserts, flyers and catalogues.\n\nSt Mary's Paper, in common with the rest of the pulp and paper industry in Canada, had been facing many adverse economic factors in recent years, arising from international economic trends, provincial policies and changing technology. This resulted in three successive restructurings between 1993 and 2012:\n\nIn 2013, the site was purchased by Riversedge Developments, a real estate developer which announced plans to convert the site into a mixed-use cultural and tourism hub through adaptive reuse of the most historically and architecturally significant buildings. Dubbed Mill Square, current plans for the site include the new home of the Algoma Conservatory of Music, a performance and arts venue, a bioenergy plant and Destination North, a cultural and tourism \"hub\" project that will incorporate interactive museum exhibits, a farmer's market and a new terminus for the Agawa Canyon Railway tour. The main building now houses a restaurant (The Mill Steak House), 2 pubs (The Boiler Room and The Steamfitter's Lounge), and a gelato/coffee shop (The Gelato Mill), along with the performance venue and conservatory. The facility is branded as The Machine Shop.\n\nIn 2015, parts of the area were purchased by The Tech including The Yard (outdoor music venue) and The Yard Locker.\n\n"}
{"id": "1922437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922437", "title": "Hook shot", "text": "Hook shot\n\nIn basketball, a hook shot is a play in which the offensive player, usually turned perpendicular to the basket, gently throws the ball with a sweeping motion of the arm farther from the basket in an upward arc with a follow-through which ends over his head. Unlike the jump shot, it is shot with only one hand; the other arm is often used to create space between the shooter and the defensive player. The shot is quite difficult to block, but few players have mastered the shot more than a few feet from the basket.\n\nThe hook shot was reportedly performed for the first time in official games in Eurobasket 1937 by Pranas Talzūnas, a member of the eventual champions, the Lithuania basketball team. Former Harlem Globetrotter Goose Tatum is often credited with inventing the hook shot; he even shot them without looking at the basket. The hook shot later became a staple of many players in the National Basketball Association, including notable stars such as George Mikan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, and Yao Ming.\n\nIn FIBA games, hook shots were a favored skill for centers before dunks became more popular, mostly because of the relative difficulty of blocking such shots.\n\nNBA Hall of Famer George Mikan developed a devastating hook shot while playing for DePaul University in the mid-1940s, as did Jerry Lucas playing for Ohio State 15 years later.\nThe hook shot became a trademark of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the National Basketball Association's all-time leading scorer, who was proficient at the shot at a much greater distance from the basket than most players. The greater distance and resulting higher arc on the shot led to the name \"skyhook\", which was coined during Abdul-Jabbar's tenure with the Milwaukee Bucks by the team's radio announcer, Eddie Doucette, who felt that \"that hook was so high that it was coming out of the sky\". The skyhook was rarely blocked, and it was accomplished by only a few players like Wilt Chamberlain and Manute Bol.\n\nMagic Johnson used a similar shooting technique during the 1987 NBA Finals, which he called his \"baby hook\" in deference to teammate Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nDue to the increasingly physical nature of low post basketball, the \"jump hook\" has become a more popular style of hook shot, and has been employed by many players including centers Shaquille O'Neal and Dwight Howard. The player jumps off using two feet, instead of taking steps and then jumping off using one foot. The jump hook provides for better balance as well as a quicker release, though the shot will not be released from as high in the air. According to Hakeem Olajuwon, it is a \"necessary shot that every center should have\", because it is very difficult to block.\n\nFormer #1 pick in the 1962 NBA draft, Billy \"The Hill\" McGill, was known for using the jump hook shot in both his college and pro careers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1922440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922440", "title": "Wallace Wilkinson", "text": "Wallace Wilkinson\n\nWallace Glenn Wilkinson (December 12, 1941 – July 5, 2002) was an American businessman and politician from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. From 1987 to 1991, he served as the state's 57th governor. Wilkinson dropped out of college at the University of Kentucky in 1962 to attend to a book retail business he started. The business rapidly became a national success, and Wilkinson re-invested his profits in real estate, farming, transportation, banking, coal, and construction ventures, becoming extremely wealthy. In 1987, he joined a crowded field in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. After running behind two former governors and the sitting lieutenant governor for most of the race, Wilkinson began to climb in the polls after hiring then-unknown campaign consultant James Carville. Wilkinson campaigned on a promise of no new taxes and advocated a state lottery as an alternative means of raising money for the state. Wilkinson surprised most political observers by winning the primary and going on to defeat his Republican challenger in the general election.\n\nWilkinson was able to secure passage of a constitutional amendment allowing a state lottery. He also helped craft a significant education reform bill in response to a ruling by the Kentucky Supreme Court that declared the state's entire public school system unconstitutional. Wilkinson's term was plagued by political scandal and an uneasy relationship with the state legislature. He advocated an amendment to the state constitution that would allow him to seek a second consecutive term as governor, but the amendment was defeated in the General Assembly. His wife Martha attempted to succeed him, but withdrew from the campaign amid weak support for her candidacy. Following his term as governor, Wilkinson encountered difficult financial times. In 2001, he was sued by a group of creditors, and during the proceedings, it was revealed that he was operating a Ponzi scheme to keep his businesses afloat. Both he and his wife Martha filed for bankruptcy later that year. In 2002, Wilkinson was hospitalized with arterial blockages. His condition was complicated by a recurrence of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002, and his family withdrew his life support the following day in accordance with his previously-expressed wishes.\n\nWallace Wilkinson was born on a farm in Casey County, Kentucky, about southwest of the city of Liberty, on December 12, 1941. The son of Hershel and Cleo (Lay) Wilkinson, he had two older brothers and a younger sister. His parents were farmers and also operated a small general store. When Wilkinson was four years old, the family moved to Liberty, and the family opened Wilkinson's Grocery. During his childhood, he delivered newspapers, sold popcorn from a street stand, and co-owned a shoe shine parlor with a boyhood friend. He also accompanied his father to sell produce from the back of a truck. It was during one such trip that he met Martha Carol Stafford, whose parents owned a grocery store about away. The two dated throughout high school and were married in 1960. They had two children: Wallace Glenn Wilkinson, Jr. (b. 1970) and Andrew Stafford Wilkinson (b. 1972).\n\nWilkinson was a member of the freshman basketball team at Liberty High School. Using profits from his early business ventures, he purchased a business wardrobe that earned him the title of best dressed member of his senior class. He graduated from high school in 1959, but the poor curriculum there left him without the credits he needed to gain admission to the University of Kentucky's engineering program. He began selling livestock feed in Scottsville, Kentucky, and also worked at a venetian blind factory while taking classes at Campbellsville College to earn the credits he needed. In 1962, he moved to Lexington, Kentucky, and enrolled at the University of Kentucky. While in college, he worked at Kennedy Book Store in Lexington. Later, he and two friends borrowed money to open the Kentucky Paperback Gallery in Lexington; Wilkinson left school later that year to attend to the business full-time. At the time, Kentucky high school students were required to purchase their own textbooks, but there was no marketplace for buying and selling used books; Wilkinson's business catered to this market and was highly successful.\n\nWilkinson opened Wallace's Book Store in June 1965 after a local stockbroker helped him raise the initial capital needed through a public stock offering. By this time, Kentucky had adopted free textbook legislation at the behest of Governor Julian Carroll, so Wilkinson transitioned to selling college textbooks to students at the University of Kentucky. Throughout the 1960s, Wilkinson refused to pay the state sales tax on his transactions; he and Joe Kennedy, the owner of Kennedy Book Store, both claimed that paying the tax put them at a competitive disadvantage with the university's book store, which did not pay state taxes because it was operated by the university, a tax exempt entity. In 1977, the state Board of Tax Appeals ruled that all three bookstores should have been paying the tax, but by this time, the statute of limitations had expired, and none of the three were required to pay any back taxes. Wallace's Book Store continued to expand rapidly, opening retail stores in twenty-eight states and becoming one of the country's largest book firms. In January 1971, he considered issuing more stock to raise capital to buy Providence, Rhode Island-based Barnes & Noble, but the executive committee of Wallace's was averse to purchasing a company so far away and blocked the move. In April 1977, Wilkinson was cited for false and misleading advertisement in conjunction with claims made in radio ads for Wallace's Book Store claiming they were offering the first discounts in history on new college textbooks. In a court filing, Wilkinson admitted the claims were untrue, promised to stop airing the ads, and agreed to refund any money overpaid by customers.\n\nWith the success of his chain of bookstores, Wilkinson pursued other business ventures in the fields of real estate development, farming, transportation, banking, coal interests, and construction. He purchased several private aircraft to help him tend to his diverse interests throughout the state, and in 1973, created Wilkinson Flying Service to keep the planes busy when he wasn't using them. After investing in the unfinished Bluegrass Commerce Center in Lexington in early 1977, he purchased one-third interest in the Purcell building on Lexington's Vine Street later that year. The building was only partially occupied, but had become more valuable because of the opening of nearby Rupp Arena in October 1976 and a new Hyatt hotel in May 1977. Developers Donald and Dudley Webb developed plans to construct the Vine Center on the block; by May 1979, they had options to buy every property on the block except Wilkinson's interest in the Purcell building. Unwilling to meet Wilkinson's asking price, they instead formed a partnership with him to co-develop the Vine Center. When Wilkinson eventually sold his interest in the venture at the end of 1981, he turned a profit of at least $1.3 million on his investment. Next, he formed a public-private partnership with the city of Lexington to construct the Capital Plaza Hotel in 1983. The city provided $3 million in capital and another $8.5 million in guaranteed loans to supplement Wilkinson's $1.15 million investment. Wallace's Book Stores was given 95% ownership in the hotel, allowing the company to shield $2 million in assets from federal income taxes and claim over $400,000 in tax credits.\n\nDespite playing a major role in the Lexington real estate market, Wilkinson was fiercely protective of his privacy; for a time, he even refused to allow newspapers to publish pictures of him. His public profile began to rise when he announced plans to construct the 50-story World Coal Center on the corner of Main and Limestone streets in Lexington. When completed, it would be the largest office complex between Atlanta and Chicago. Wilkinson hoped that all the major coal companies in the state would relocate their offices to the center, making it a hub for the international coal market. Shortly after Wilkinson demolished the historic Phoenix Hotel to make way for the building, the coal market experienced a pronounced lull, and the empty lot where the proposed coal center would have stood was derided as \"Wally's Folly\" and \"Lake Wilkinson\". In 1984, the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government secured a lease from Wilkinson to develop a temporary municipal park on the site. Wilkinson conceded that he would not be able to develop the proposed World Coal Center in the near-term, and Lexington mayor Scotty Baesler wanted to improve the property before the city hosted the finals of the 1985 NCAA men's basketball tournament at Rupp Arena. In early 1985, Wilkinson struck a deal with the state and urban county governments to retain the park and build a public library and parking garage while allowing Wilkinson to construct and operate a 21-story apartment complex above the garage. Critics claimed that the city-county government bailed Wilkinson out of a bad investment by purchasing the property from him and by giving him a government-subsidized, low interest rate on his $12 million mortgage for the apartment building.\n\nOn April 10, 1984, Wilkinson was allegedly kidnapped by a man named Jerome Jernigan. In 1977, Wilkinson had provided Jernigan with start-up money for Jernigan Export Timber, Inc., a company that manufactured and exported wood veneers internationally. The company went defunct around the time of Jernigan's divorce from his wife, the secretary-treasurer of the company, in December 1980. Jernigan's son, Victor, continued to work for Wilkinson in another capacity until 1982.\n\nAccording to Wilkinson, in the months leading up to the alleged kidnapping, Jernigan had come to Wilkinson's office several times demanding money he claimed he was owed from his prior business dealings with Wilkinson. Wilkinson said he had been making the requested payments, but that when he refused Jernigan's request on April 10, Jernigan presented him with a four-page suicide note, then produced a pistol and told Wilkinson, \"I'm going to kill you first.\" Wilkinson further alleged that Jernigan forced him to drive to the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Frankfort, a hotel Wilkinson owned, at gunpoint. The two spent the night at the hotel, and sometime during the night, Wilkinson contacted James Aldridge, president of New Farmers National Bank in Glasgow, Kentucky. Wilkinson, who owned an interest in New Farmers National Bank, told Aldridge he needed $500,000 as soon as possible. The next day, Wilkinson and Jernigan flew to Glasgow aboard a plane operated by Wilkinson Flying Service, another company owned by Wilkinson. Wilkinson said Jernigan threatened to kill employees at the company if Wilkinson attempted to alert them. Aldridge met Wilkinson and Jernigan with the money Wilkinson had requested at the Glasgow Municipal Airport. Upon their arrival, Wilkinson paid Jernigan $500,000 and was released unharmed.\n\nAfter his release, Wilkinson alerted the FBI, and Jernigan was arrested the same day in Lexington. Upon his arrest, he was in possession of two pistols, six sets of handcuffs, and $400,000 in cash. Jernigan told authorities that he and Wilkinson had spent the previous night at the Crowne Plaza negotiating a settlement to their differences stemming from their earlier business relationship. The terms of the settlement, Jernigan maintained, included a $500,000 cash payment from Wilkinson, part of which would finance a new business venture similar to Jernigan's previous veneer export business. Wilkinson would also furnish Jernigan with a car, a furnished apartment in Lexington, and a salary of $5,000 a month. Jernigan stated that after the $500,000 was paid, Wilkinson decided to back out of the settlement and portray the encounter as a crime. Wilkinson denied Jernigan's allegations and maintained that the money – which was later recovered – was demanded by Jernigan as a ransom for his release.\n\nWeeks later, Jernigan filed a counter-suit against Wilkinson in Fayette County circuit court. He asked the court to award him $50 million in punitive damages and to determine the profits made by his and Wilkinson's veneer company, of which he would receive half. A judge ordered the case moved to Louisville because the alleged crime was committed in Glasgow, in the state's western district. State charges against Jernigan, which included kidnapping and carrying a concealed deadly weapon, were dropped so that the federal extortion charges could take precedence. Over the objection of his legal counsel, the court ordered Jernigan to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he was insane or mentally incompetent for his own defense. The court-appointed psychiatrist found Jernigan competent to stand trial, and he was released in late May on a $25,000 bond.\n\nAfter his release on bond, Jernigan returned to the room at the Continental Inn in Lexington where he had been living prior to his arrest. On July 18, 1984, Jernigan's son Randy found him dead in the room. An autopsy showed that Jernigan suffered from coronary atherosclerosis, and heart disease was officially listed as the cause of death. Lexington police determined that there was no evidence to suggest foul play. Jernigan's ex-wife continued to pursue Jernigan's case against Wilkinson, but a Fayette County Circuit Court Judge awarded Wilkinson a summary judgment to dismiss the case in 1986.\n\nAfter announcing his plans for the World Coal Center, Wilkinson began attending meetings of the Lexington Urban City Council, where he advocated his fiscally conservative political views. He was an admirer of Ronald Reagan, although he said he wished Reagan was a Democrat like himself. In 1979, Wilkinson became involved with Terry McBrayer's campaign against John Y. Brown, Jr. in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. He held a critical fundraiser for Scotty Baesler's 1981 Lexington mayoral campaign, although most of the businessmen in Lexington favored Baesler's opponent. In the 1983 Democratic gubernatorial primary, he served as finance chairman for Harvey Sloane's campaign. When Sloane lost a close race to Lieutenant Governor Martha Layne Collins, Republican nominee Jim Bunning tried to enlist the support of Sloane and his supporters, including Wilkinson. After a month of consideration, however, Wilkinson endorsed the entire Democratic ticket. The following year, he managed former governor Brown's brief senatorial campaign. Already considering running for governor in 1987, Wilkinson had hoped to remove Brown as a potential competitor for that office by helping him get elected to the Senate, but Brown ended his campaign early for health reasons. Through his work in various the campaigns, Wilkinson found that he enjoyed the challenges of competing in the political arena. He lobbied the General Assembly to pass a multi-bank holding company bill allowing banking companies to own more than one Kentucky bank. The bill passed in 1984.\n\nIn April 1985, Wilkinson formed a campaign committee in advance of the 1987 gubernatorial election. Relatively unknown statewide, Wilkinson was the first candidate to enter the race. The Democratic primary field eventually grew to include two previous Kentucky governors, John Y. Brown, Jr. and Julian Carroll; sitting Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, who would later win two terms as governor in 2007 and 2011; and Grady Stumbo, cabinet secretary for Governor Martha Layne Collins. Early in the race, Brown was the clear-cut favorite, while Wilkinson was picked to finish fifth. Wilkinson financed his own campaign and campaign manager Danny Briscoe suggested that he hire a campaign consultant to reach out to the state's large concentration of undecided voters. After a few interviews, Wilkinson hired a then-unknown political consultant named James Carville; Carville later went on to chair Bill Clinton's successful presidential campaign in 1992.\nBeshear, considered the second strongest candidate in the primary race, spent much of the campaign attacking Brown, and Brown spent time and resources responding to Beshear's attacks. Meanwhile, Wilkinson attacked all of his opponents in the race as political insiders while touting his own rise from poverty to financial success. He called the incentive package that sitting governor Martha Layne Collins had offered to lure a Toyota manufacturing plant to the state \"a massive mistake and terrible deal\" that had made Kentucky \"an international laughingstock\". He also claimed that both Brown and Beshear would raise taxes and proposed a state lottery, which he claimed would generate $70 million annually for the state's coffers, as an alternative to higher taxes. The proposal proved particularly popular in Northern Kentucky, where residents routinely traveled to neighboring Ohio to play that state's lottery. Wilkinson also advocated for wholesale education reform, stating that Kentucky's children \"don't have a learning problem; they've got a schooling problem.\" Two-time former governor A. B. \"Happy\" Chandler gave Wilkinson's campaign further credibility with his endorsement.\n\nIn late April, Brown still held a 20 percentage point lead in public opinion polling. However, as Beshear began to slip in the polls, Wilkinson moved up. By Memorial Day weekend, he was polling second among the candidates. Brown largely ignored Wilkinson until a week before the election, when he began running ads questioning the amount of money Wilkinson claimed would be generated by a state lottery. Wilkinson won the primary, garnering 36 percent of the vote to 26 percent for Brown, 18 percent for Beshear, 12 percent for Stumbo, and 6 percent for Carroll. In total, Wilkinson spent a record $4 million during the primary campaign. Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark opined that Wilkinson's lavish spending during the campaign prompted the legislature to adopt campaign finance reform measures.\n\nDemocrats enjoyed a 3-to-1 voter registration advantage in Kentucky, and while he had been the underdog in the primary campaign, Wilkinson became the heavy favorite against the Republican nominee, State Representative John Harper of Shepherdsville. Larry Forgy, who had been groomed for the Republican nomination, unexpectedly dropped out of the race before the primary, leaving the party at a significant disadvantage with a largely unknown and underfunded candidate. While Harper began his general election campaign immediately, Wilkinson made few public appearances – except for fundraisers – until the second week in September. He also refused to endorse the $125 million education reform measure that sitting governor Martha Layne Collins had guided through the legislature in 1985, which cost him the endorsement of the Kentucky Education Association. The association endorsed Harper, marking the first time in its history it had endorsed a Republican gubernatorial candidate, but endorsed Brereton Jones, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor.\n\nHarper attacked Wilkinson's lottery proposal as \"Alice in Wonderland\" economics. In addition, Harper's campaign raised a number of ethical issues with regard to Wilkinson's business dealings. Gary Stafford, Wilkinson's brother-in-law who was serving as president of Wallace's Book Store, pleaded guilty to illegal wiretapping and rolling back the odometers on company vehicles. The company was also forced to pay $44,641 in back taxes. Further, Republican state chairman Bob Gable questioned whether Wilkinson had helped Italian businessmen circumvent laws that made it difficult to export Italian currency by disguising real estate ventures as legitimate business transactions with Jernigan Export Timber. Gable also hired a private investigator who determined that there was \"substantial reason\" to suspect that foul play was involved in the death of Wilkinson's business partner, Jerome Jernigan. Despite Gable's allegations and the investigator's findings, Lexington police officials said they saw no reason to re-open the investigation. Harper was at a substantial fundraising disadvantage, raising only $225,000 for the entire campaign compared to Wilkinson's $8 million. This left him unable to purchase enough media time to solidify any of the ethical questions about Wilkinson in the voters' minds. Wilkinson's campaign also delved into Harper's personal life, admitting that it tipped off the media about Harper's son, who had been shot to death in an attempted burglary.\n\nIn the general election, Wilkinson defeated Harper by a vote of 504,674 to 273,141. By capturing 65% of the vote, he broke Julian Carroll's record of 62.8%. Low voter turnout prohibited him from setting the record for most votes received by a candidate in a Kentucky gubernatorial election, and he received several thousand fewer votes than Brereton Jones, the victorious Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor. He carried 115 of Kentucky's 120 counties – besting Carroll's old record of 99 – but lost in Fayette, his county of residence. A poll conducted by a Louisville television station after the election showed that 76% of voters wished they had another candidate to vote for.\n\nEven before he officially took office, some of Wilkinson's public comments set up an adversarial relationship with the General Assembly. Just two days after his election, he told reporters that he would exert the \"full power\" of his office toward getting his agenda approved by the legislature and that he \"conceive of a situation\" where he would use his political action committee (PAC), Kentuckians for a Better Future, to help defeat legislators who opposed him. Under governors Brown and Collins, the legislature had become increasingly independent of the governor, and \"Lexington Herald-Leader\" reporters opined that House Speaker Don Blandford and Senate President Pro Tem John \"Eck\" Rose would be reluctant to cede power back to the chief executive. During the 1988 legislative session, Rose introduced a bill setting a limit of $4,000 on the amount PACs could contribute to an individual's campaigns during a single election and a limit of $2,000 on the amount any individual could contribute to a single PAC in a given election. A month later, Wilkinson recanted, saying he \"misspoke\" and only intended to use his PAC to promote passage of the lottery amendment. Despite the governor's promise, the legislature passed Rose's bill.\n\nTensions also developed between Wilkinson and Lieutenant Governor-Elect Jones soon after the election. During the campaign, Jones was quoted as saying that he had talked with Wilkinson about being more open with the press and said that, if elected, he would not be a \"yes man\" for Wilkinson. At a press conference shortly after the election, Wilkinson said he did not know what role Jones would play in his administration and that much of it would depend on what Jones had meant when he said he did not agree with all of Wilkinson's positions. In late November 1987, Wilkinson announced that Jones would spearhead the promotion of the administration's agricultural agenda. The \"Lexington Herald-Leader\" reported that this would not be Jones' primary role in the administration but that no other specifics had been provided.\n\nAlthough amendments removing Kentucky's constitutional prohibition on a state lottery had been introduced in every legislative session since the mid-1970s, Wilkinson's election provided the issue with fresh momentum, and the General Assembly passed the amendment by the required majorities in the 1988 session. Another amendment passed during Wilkinson's term required landowner approval before strip mining could occur on a piece of property. This amendment essentially overturned a 1956 court ruling and negated the practice of issuing broad form deeds which allowed property owners to sell their mineral rights while retaining ownership of structures and other improvements above-ground. A third amendment for which Wilkinson advocated would have allowed elected state officials to succeed themselves in office. During his gubernatorial campaign, he insisted that he would not seek to have such an amendment apply to himself, but shortly after his election, he reversed course and insisted on an amendment that did not exclude present incumbents. The amendment became one of Wilkinson's top priorities in the 1988 legislative session, and he threatened to work against legislators who opposed it. Legislators proposed that a succession amendment include provisions to lengthen the terms of state legislators to maintain a balance of power between the executive and legislative branches; Wilkinson insisted that the General Assembly pass a \"clean\" succession amendment, free from any other provisions that might diminish the amendment's chances of being approved by the state's voters. The Kentucky House of Representatives passed such an amendment, but the state Senate continued to press for legislative concessions, proposing annual legislative sessions and mandatory runoffs in gubernatorial primaries when one candidate did not receive a majority of the votes cast. When Wilkinson rejected both proposals, Senate leaders refused to bring the amendment to the floor for a vote. Wilkinson's reversal on his campaign promise not to seek succession for present incumbents damaged his reputation.\n\nWilkinson's advocacy for the amendment further damaged his relationship with Lieutenant Governor Jones because Jones had already announced his intention to run for governor in 1991. After the session, Jones told a crowd in Owensboro that if Wilkinson called a special session to insist that legislators pass his educational agenda, that the General Assembly would probably \"throw it back in his face\". In response, Wilkinson said that Jones should \"be involved in improving the process, not be so negative about everything\" and \"pay attention to his own business\". A \"Lexington Herald-Leader\" story noted that a promised news conference to elaborate on Jones' role in the administration had not yet happened and that \"[m]ost observers expect it never will\". The two men's relationship continued to be strained throughout their terms; Jones later described it as \"terrible\".\n\nLeaders of the Southern Baptists and United Methodists led opposition to the amendment during Wilkinson's administration, activating the Coalition Against a State Lottery. Despite the opposition, Kentucky voters approved the lottery amendment by a vote of 694,577 to 446,937 in the November 1988 elections. Days after the election, Wilkinson signed a proclamation calling a special legislative session to begin November 28 to pass legislation to implement the lottery. The call instructed the legislature to consider a bill based on the recommendations of Wilkinson's lottery commission. The recommendations included the establishment of a lottery board whose president and members would be appointed by the governor and could only be removed by the governor, and earmarked the first year's proceeds to be split evenly between early childhood education programs, programs for the elderly, and a one-time bonus to veterans of the Vietnam War. Legislators insisted on more legislative control of the lottery and did not favor explicit earmarks for the proceeds, preferring to allocate them in the 1990 legislative session. They also objected to the lottery board's exemption from open records and open meetings laws.\n\nImmediately after the session convened, Democratic leadership in both houses of the General Assembly announced they would not support earmarking lottery funds, but would let them accumulate in escrow until the 1990 legislative session. On December 14, legislators adjourned the session after passing a bill that created an eight-member lottery board, headed by a president appointed by the governor and confirmed by the other seven members. The other seven members of the board would serve staggered terms, would be appointed by the governor, and be confirmed by the Senate. The legislation also escrowed proceeds until the 1990 General Assembly and specified that the first expenditures from those proceeds would fund a one-time bonus to veterans of the Vietnam War. The vote on the legislation was 32–5 in the Senate and 92–6 in the House. Several Republican amendments, including one by Senator David L. Williams to implement a local option for counties to decide whether or not to sell lottery tickets, were defeated on party-line votes. While the legislation did not implement all of Wilkinson's proposals for the lottery, he nonetheless praised it as a \"very good\" bill.\n\nOn May 31, 1988, Franklin County circuit court judge Ray Corns issued a ruling in the case of \"Council for Better Education v. Collins, et al.\" stating that Kentucky's system of school financing was unconstitutional. The suit was brought against Wilkinson's predecessor, Martha Layne Collins, and several members of the state government by a group of poor school districts as a means to equalize funding for all the state's school districts. An advocate for education, Wilkinson dropped the governor's office's defense in the suit and joined the plaintiffs when Corns' decision was appealed to the Kentucky Supreme Court. On appeal, the Supreme Court declared Kentucky's entire public school system unconstitutional and mandated that the legislature reform it.\n\nAlthough state legislators maintained that reforming the public school system was too large an issue to tackle during the 60-day legislative session of 1990 and requested that Wilkinson call a special legislative session in June 1990 to consider the issue, the governor insisted that the issue be resolved during the regular session and said that he would not allow consideration of tax increases to fund improvements in the system if he had to call a special session. Wilkinson presented a budget proposal to the General Assembly that contained measures increasing taxes on cigarettes and corporations and eliminating sales tax exemptions on legal, engineering, and advertising services. Legislators favored raising the sales tax to six percent instead. For much of the legislative session, Wilkinson remained steadfastly opposed to an increased sales tax, repeatedly calling it a \"dead issue\" and threatening to veto it. Then on March 9, 1990, Wilkinson announced that he would drop his opposition to the tax in exchange for the Assembly's approval of a $600 million bond issue to finance road improvements he had promised during the campaign. The \"Lexington Herald-Leader\" called the move \"a stunning reversal\" and noted that Wilkinson would not comment on why he changed his mind. With the impasse between the legislature and Wilkinson resolved, House Speaker Don Blandford announced that the remainder of the session would focus only on approving the state budget and passing the court-mandated education reforms; any bills still in committees would not be brought to a vote, he said. On April 11, 1990, the Assembly passed the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) to comply with the Supreme Court's decision. Besides increasing funding for schools, it mandated high performance measures and held schools accountable for meeting them. Educators hailed the legislation as being among the nation's best education reform plans.\n\nEven after KERA was passed, disagreements between Wilkinson and the legislature continued. The $600 million bond issue for road construction that had been the price for Wilkinson's support of the sales tax was modified to include language that allowed the legislature to determine where the roads were constructed. Wilkinson threatened to veto the measure, claiming he did not need the General Assembly's approval to issue the bonds, but ultimately, he chose to allow it to become law without his signature. Wilkinson vetoed 21 bills passed by the legislature, but 13 of those vetoes were overridden; it was the most gubernatorial vetoes overridden in a single session in modern times. Most of the overridden vetoes were on bills strengthening the legislative branch relative to the executive branch. The General Assembly also voted to send two proposed constitutional amendments that strengthened the legislative branch relative to the executive to voters for ratification. One allowed the legislature to call itself into session – a power constitutionally reserved for the governor – if two-thirds of its members signed a petition to do so. The other allowed a committee of legislators to suspend regulations enacted by the executive branch between legislative sessions until the full legislature re-convened. Through his political action committee, Wilkinson opposed both measures, and both were rejected by the state's voters in the November 1990 elections.\n\nThe political debates and posturing leading up to the passing of KERA also permanently breached the relationship between Wilkinson and Lieutenant Governor Jones. During a teachers' rally in Frankfort, Jones was sympathetic to their demands for more money for education than Wilkinson was supporting. Jones wanted to speak to the crowd that had gathered outside the Capitol. While in the governor's office, Wilkinson told Jones that if he spoke to the crowd, he should never \" in this office again.\" Jones defied Wilkinson by speaking to the teachers and, according to Penny Miller, editor of Jones' public papers, never again entered Wilkinson's office.\n\nWilkinson also advanced economic development in the state. During his tenure, Delta Air Lines nearly doubled the number of people it employed at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport; Wilkinson secured Delta's expansion by agreeing to limit the company's sales tax liability on jet fuel to $4 million annually. Additionally, Scott Paper Company opened a plant near Owensboro and North American Stainless, a Spanish-owned steel company, located a plant near Carrollton. During his term in office, Wilkinson served on the Education Commission of the States, the Southern Growth Policies Board, and the Council of the State Governments and the Southern States Energy Board. He was elected chair of the Southern Governors Association in 1990 and served on the Education Commission of the States' Policy and Priorities Committee.\n\nThe Wilkinson administration was dogged by ethical questions that eventually resulted in prosecution of some members. Before being elected governor, Wilkinson asked the Kentucky attorney general to rule on his ownership of the Holiday Inn Capital Plaza Hotel in Frankfort. The ruling stated that he should sell the hotel, and in November 1987, Kentucky Central Life Insurance, a state-regulated company, purchased the property for $12 million, which included $8.2 million of debt. Kentucky Central became insolvent in 1994 and was ordered into liquidation. The following year, Kentucky Insurance Commissioner George Nichols III assumed the liquidation and brought suit against Wilkinson stating that the property was only worth $6 million. Franklin County Circuit Judge Earl O'Bannon dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that Wilkinson had not knowingly participated in Kentucky Central's breach of financial responsibility, even though it had, in his words, an \"odor of politics.\"\n\nFurther, an FBI (Operation Boptrot) investigation of the Kentucky General Assembly led to Wilkinson's nephew, Bruce N. Wilkinson, who served as his appointment secretary. Bruce Wilkinson was convicted of extortion, fined $20,000, and sentenced to three years in prison. Wallace Wilkinson was investigated by a grand jury but never indicted. He vehemently denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn 1990, Wilkinson's wife, Martha, announced that she would seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1991. The move was widely seen as a surrogate candidacy so that her husband could continue his administration for a second consecutive term. Her challengers included Lieutenant Governor Jones, Lexington mayor Scotty Baesler, and Dr. Floyd G. Poore, the former Kentucky highway director. With polls consistently showing little support for her candidacy, Mrs. Wilkinson dropped out of the race in May 1991. Earlier in the year, Wallace Wilkinson was diagnosed with limited-stage Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This diagnosis was also a factor in Ms. Wilkinson's withdrawal from the race. Wallace underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, then received radiation therapy at the University of Kentucky. These treatments eliminated all signs of the disease by 1993, and doctors gave Wilkinson an excellent chance of recovery.\n\nAs Wilkinson's term ended, he appointed himself to a six-year term on the University of Kentucky's board of regents. The move was unprecedented, and was particularly controversial because of Wilkinson's open feuds with Charles T. Wethington, Jr., the university president. An incensed legislature passed a law shortly thereafter that dissolved the existing boards of trustees at all Kentucky public colleges and universities and mandated that they be reconstituted by allowing the governor to select each member from a list of three candidates recommended by an independent review board. Jones, who succeeded Wilkinson as governor, used the provisions of the law to remove Wilkinson and several of his appointees from the university boards.\n\nAfter his service as governor, Wilkinson returned to his business pursuits. In the early 1990s, he began borrowing money to keep his bookstore business solvent and to support his lavish lifestyle. His interest in running for another non-consecutive term as governor appeared to be dampened by the system of public financing that Kentucky had in place at that time for gubernatorial elections. In 1995, he published his memoir entitled \"You Can't Do That, Governor!\"; a major theme of the book was his disdain for conventional wisdom and political norms. In 1999, he launched ECampus.com, an Internet book retailer. Among the investors in the company were Wendy's founder Dave Thomas, Long John Silver's founder James Patterson, and Ohio State University president William English Kirwan.\n\nOn February 5, 2001, a group of Wilkinson's creditors filed suit to have his companies seized. During the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, Wilkinson admitted that his liabilities exceeded his assets by $300 million. During the proceedings, it was revealed that Wilkinson had been financially insolvent since 1992 and was operating a Ponzi scheme, paying his creditors with money borrowed from others rather than his own profits. He had paid no federal income taxes since 1991. At his deposition in June 2001, Wilkinson invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination over 140 times. Wallace's Bookstore was liquidated for just over $31 million, and ecampus.com was sold for $2.5 million. Wilkinson's wife, Martha, also filed for bankruptcy; his sons were forced to sell their homes to repay loans made to them by their father. During the bankruptcy proceedings, the Wilkinsons moved from Lexington to Naples, Florida.\n\nWhile in Lexington for a deposition on May 26, 2002, Wilkinson began to experience chest pains and was admitted to St. Joseph's Hospital. Doctors diagnosed him with arterial blockages and scheduled him for arterial bypass surgery. Before the surgery could be performed, however, doctors discovered another lymphatic mass. Wilkinson began taking chemotherapy, and doctors removed the mass on June 4, 2002. Wilkinson was placed on life support on June 26, 2002. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002. Wilkinson had previously instructed his family not to continue life support after all hope of recovery was gone; accordingly, they decided to withdraw life support, and Wilkinson died on July 5, 2002. He was originally buried at Blue Grass Memorial Gardens in Nicholasville, Kentucky. In August 2002, his coffin was moved to a locked mausoleum at Sarasota Memorial Park in Sarasota, Florida; the family chose July 4, 2002 as the date of death for his marker. The city of Liberty dubbed the stretch of the U.S. 127 bypass that runs through the city Wallace Wilkinson Boulevard in 1987.\n\n\n\n"}

F. Green Airport in Rhode Island and ending at Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, with an intermediate stop at John F. Kennedy International Airport. 37 out of the 88 passengers onboard died in the accident.\n\nThe American Airlines Boeing 727-23, registration overran the departure end of Runway 9 when landing at Harry S. Truman airport. The aircraft struck an Instrument Landing System antenna, crashed through a chain link fence, and traveled another until stopped by a gas station. The aircraft was destroyed.\n\nThe airport in St. Thomas was notorious among pilots for its short () runway. In fact, the Boeing 727 was the heaviest aircraft type authorized to use it, and even then it was only authorized in one direction.\n\nUltimately, the NTSB attributed the crash to pilot error on the approach. The maximum flap setting of 40 degrees was never applied, which meant that the aircraft's speed was higher than V as it crossed the runway threshold. This, combined with the fact that the aircraft 'floated' from turbulent winds in the area, meant that it was already down the runway at the point of touchdown. The pilots did not brake, and proceeded to apply full throttle three seconds after touchdown. However, they were unable to reach takeoff speed because the 727's engines are slow-responding, taking about 6.6 seconds to power up. After five seconds of waiting for power, and with only of runway left, the pilot panicked, according to the report, and applied full brakes. Further, the pilot forgot to apply reverse engine thrust until immediately before impact.\n\nUltimately, the aircraft ran off the end of the runway and into a Shell gas station, killing 37 (35 passengers and 2 flight attendants) of the 88 on board. Thirty-eight other passengers and crew were injured, and one person on the ground was seriously injured. The probable cause was the captain's actions and his judgment in not being aware that when he touched down down the runway, he did not have enough distance to perform a go-around.\n\nAs a result of the crash, American Airlines ended all jet flights to St. Thomas, flying instead to St. Croix (which had a 7,600 foot runway at the time). American Airlines passengers were then flown to St. Thomas in Convair 440 propeller-driven aircraft from St. Croix (as well as San Juan), with these flights being operated by a wholly owned subsidiary, American Inter-Island Airlines. Jet flights operated by American resumed when the runway at St. Thomas was lengthened to .\n\nAmerican Airlines Flight 625 was specifically mentioned in the movie \"Rain Man\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1922473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922473", "title": "Tarrasch rule", "text": "Tarrasch rule\n\nThe Tarrasch rule is a general principle that applies in the majority of chess middlegames and endgames. Siegbert Tarrasch (1862–1934) stated the \"rule\" that rooks should be placed behind passed pawns – either yours or your opponent's. The idea behind the guideline is that (1) if a player's rook is behind his passed pawn, the rook protects it as it advances, and (2) if it is behind an opponent's passed pawn, the pawn cannot advance unless it is protected along its way.\n\nThe original quote came from his famous book about the St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament, which was translated into English in 1993:\n\nHe referred to his rule 24 years later on page 57 of his book \"The Game of Chess\" (1938) as:\n\nThis \"rule\" is usually true, but not always, as there are many exceptions. Tarrasch has been quoted as saying, \"Always put the rook behind the pawn... Except when it is incorrect to do so.\" .\nConsider the cases in the diagram. On the b-file, White's rook is behind the pawn, while Black's is in front of it. Other things being equal, Black cannot do much to stop the pawn's advance. The rook can block it, but as soon as the rook moves elsewhere, the pawn can advance. In addition, as the pawn advances, the space the rook can move to attack it continues to shrink, while the range of the white rook increases. Thus, a rook is better-placed behind one's own pawn.\n\nIn the case on the g-file, roles are reversed: White's rook is behind Black's pawn while Black's rook is in front. As the pawn advances, White's rook has more freedom of movement, while Black's becomes ever more constrained. White cannot actively block the pawn, but if Black wishes to promote, Black must at some point move the rook off the g-file, leaving the pawn if there is no other support. Thus, a rook is better-placed behind an enemy pawn.\n\nHere are two positions to illustrate the principle.\n\nIn the first diagram, White's rook is behind his passed pawn on the \"a\"-, and the position is won for White.\n\nThe winning technique is straightforward:\nThe 34th game of the 1927 World Championship match between Alekhine and Capablanca is a classic example of the technique (or see annotated text). The position is after White's 54.Ra4. White won on move 82 .\n\nSimilar positions with the rook behind the enemy passed pawn are usually a draw, but not always. The next position is after White's 35th move in the eighth game of the Henrique Mecking versus Victor Korchnoi match in 1974. White will move Ra6 as soon as possible. Black's rook is in front of his passed pawn on the a-file, and the game ended in a draw on move 55 .\nIn this game between Viswanathan Anand and Vladimir Kramnik from the 2007 World Chess Championship, Black's rook is in front of his passed pawn; the white rook will get behind the pawn:\nBlack advanced the pawn to a2, but could do no better than to exchange the passed pawn and rook for the white rook, reaching a king and pawn endgame that ended in a draw (see stalemate) on move 65 .\nIn the position from a game between Wolfgang Unzicker and Erik Lundin, White to move wins, however 48. f3+! is the only winning move. If the black pawn were still on f7, the black king could go back to f6 or g7 and the position would be a draw. (If 48.a7? Ra2+ and 49...Kf3 draws.)\n\nThe reason this type of position was long thought to be an easy draw is as follows:\n\nRecent theoretical analysis of this position shows that White has a strong maneuver: \nBlack must play very carefully to draw, rather than the very easy draw that was long thought to be the case.\nKantorovich analyzed the position in the diagram on the right and thought that Black draws with two tempos to spare. In 2003 Steckner found an improvement for White that wins. Black's pieces are in their optimum positions: the rook is behind the a-pawn and attacking the f-pawn and the king is in its most active location. If 1.Ra8 Kf5 Black has an easy draw; however, White has a better plan which wins with precise play:\n\nThis 2008 game between Levon Aronian and Vassily Ivanchuk ended in a draw after 62 moves. The evaluation of this type of position with an extra b-pawn is still in flux as of 2010, but current theory is that it is drawish .\n\nThere are exceptions to the Tarrasch rule. Here are some.\n\nThis position from Nigel Short and Artur Yusupov in 1984 is an exception to the rule, since white's king is stuck in front of the pawn . White played 1. Rh3 (rook behind passed pawn), Black replied 1... Kf5 and a draw resulted a few moves later. The move 1. Rf7 by White leads to a win.\n\nThe position from a 1995 game between Andrei Kharlov and Alexander Morozevich is one in which the Tarrasch rule does not apply (for Black) . The move 1...Rb7 would be in accordance with the Tarrasch rule, but 1... Re5 is the correct method because White's king is cut off from the pawn, White will have to spend a lot of time activating his rook, and by that time the black king will be able to get over to the queenside. The rule still applies for White, however, and the game continued:\n\nAfter 13.Kg2 Rc1 14.Rd8 b1=Q 15.Rb8+ Kc6 16.Rxb1 Rxb1 Black's king is close enough to the kingside pawns to stop them.\n\nThe 1993 game between Vladimir Kramnik and Alexander Beliavsky has an unusual position in which following the Tarrasch Rule is incorrect. White played 1. Ra1 and lost. 1.Rb8, abandoning the pawn so the rook can attack from behind, draws. The endgame with rooks and f- and h-pawns was analyzed to be a draw by Mikhail Botvinnik in the 1940s (with correct defense) .\n\nIn this 1992 game between Artur Yusupov and Jan Timman, 35.Re4! wins but 35. Ra1? in the actual game only draws. The game was drawn twenty moves later .\n\nBibliography\n"}

He is currently the bench coach for the Colorado Rockies. He played for 13 seasons in Major League Baseball with the Florida Marlins, Minnesota Twins, and Cleveland Indians. In 864 career games, Redmond recorded a batting average of .287 and accumulated 13 home runs, and 243 runs batted in (RBI).\n\nRedmond batted and threw right-handed. He made his major league debut on May 31, 1998, and played his final game on July 2, 2010, and was part of the Florida Marlins team that won the 2003 World Series. He was named the manager of the Marlins on November 1, 2012. After two and a half years, Redmond was fired on May 17, 2015.\n\nMichael Patrick Redmond was born on May 5, 1971 in Seattle, five minutes after his fraternal twin brother, Patrick Michael. His father, Pat Sr., was a grocery store buyer.\n\nRedmond grew up in Kirkland, Washington, where he played Little League baseball. His family moved to Spokane, Washington, where Mike and his brother attended Gonzaga Preparatory School, graduating in 1989. Mike, a catcher, and Patrick, a shortstop, both played baseball for the Gonzaga Prep baseball team. In his senior season at Gonzaga Prep, Mike had a .300 batting average with three home runs and 21 runs batted in. He set a single-game record for putouts by a catcher with 15, the single-season record for assists with 114.\n\nBoth Redmond brothers committed to attend Gonzaga University, where they played college baseball for the Gonzaga Bulldogs baseball team, when it competed in the Pacific-10 Conference (Pac-10), from 1990 through 1993. Redmond was named a first team Pac-10 all-conference selection in 1991 and 1992. Redmond was invited to Homestead, Florida, where he participated in the United States national baseball team trials for the 1992 Summer Olympics.\n\nUndrafted in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft, Redmond signed with the Florida Marlins as an undrafted free agent on August 18, 1992. He made his professional debut in minor league baseball with the Kane County Cougars of the Class A Midwest League in 1993, and also played for the Cougars in 1994. He was promoted to the Brevard County Manatees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League in 1994, and the Portland Sea Dogs of the Class AA Eastern League in 1995. After playing with Portland in 1996, he was promoted to the Charlotte Knights of the Class AAA International League in 1997. Redmond had shoulder surgery in 1997, and was presented the option of playing for Portland or remaining with the organization as a coach. Redmond opted to continue playing, returning to Portland in 1998.\n\nRedmond made his Major League debut with Florida on May 31, 1998, receiving the opportunity after the Marlins traded Charles Johnson and Mike Piazza; he hit .331 in 37 games that year for the Marlins. He played with the Marlins as a backup catcher, often sharing time with Johnson, Jorge Fábregas, and Paul Bako. In 2002, Redmond posted career-highs in both batting average, hitting .305, and in games played with 89. In the following season, he served as the backup to Iván Rodríguez, as the Marlins won the 2003 World Series. When the Marlins fell into a slump in 2003, he would take batting practice wearing only batting gloves, socks, and shoes.\n\nIn 2004, with Rodríguez signing with the Detroit Tigers, Redmond split catching duties with Ramón Castro. However, he got injured early into the season when, while running the bases, his left pinky finger was spiked by Marcus Giles, resulting in a chipped fracture.\n\nRedmond signed a two-year contract with the Minnesota Twins to backup starting catcher Joe Mauer before the 2005 season. His 2005 season ended prematurely due to a torn plantar fascia in his right foot. During the 2007 season, Redmond signed a two-year contract extension with a club option for the 2009 season. He played in 82 games during the 2007 season due to an injury to Mauer, though he continued to play through his own injuries, including a broken finger, bruised shoulder, and stitches in his head. During the 2008 season, Redmond frequently joined Dan Gladden on the Twins Radio Network live broadcasts prior to the game to give his insight from the dugout. After the 2008 season, the Twins exercised an option on Redmond's contract, paying him $950,000 for the 2009 season. He suffered injury in the beginning of the season in a game against the Mariners; after escaping unscathed from a hit to the shoulder by a broken bat, Redmond aggravated a groin muscle while attempting to run out a ground ball.\n\nOn May 28, 2009, Redmond was ejected from a game for the first time in his career after a furious reaction to a safe call at home plate. The call occurred in a game against the Boston Red Sox that saw both teams have their managers and catchers ejected in the same inning. Redmond successfully relayed an outfield assist from Jason Kubel and tagged Jeff Bailey out just before he reached home plate—which subsequent replays confirmed—but home plate umpire Todd Tichenor ruled that Bailey was safe. Redmond then got into a face-to-face argument with Tichenor, which led to his ejection. Tichenor also ejected Twins manager Ron Gardenhire for defending Redmond, before subsequently throwing both Terry Francona and Jason Varitek out for an unrelated matter.\n\nThe Twins let Redmond leave after the 2009 season, opting to use Drew Butera and José Morales as their backup catchers. On January 15, 2010, Redmond signed a one-year contract with a guaranteed salary of $850,000 to play for the Cleveland Indians The Indians credited Redmond with helping Fausto Carmona have a strong start to the 2010 season. He committed an error on May 23, 2010, which was his first error since July 22, 2004. The 253 game streak without an error set a new MLB record, besting Mike Matheny's 252 consecutive errorless games from 2002 to 2004. However, Redmond batted .206 in 22 games, and was designated for assignment on July 10, 2010 to make room on the 40-man roster for catcher/outfielder Chris Gimenez. Redmond had only played in three games since June 8, and the Indians wanted to develop their younger players. On July 16, 2010, Redmond was released by the Indians.\n\nRedmond retired on October 4, 2010. In 2011, Redmond managed the Lansing Lugnuts of the Midwest League, the Class A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays. The Lugnuts had their best record in team history under Redmond, and reached the league finals. He was named Midwest League manager of the year. In 2012, he managed the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League, the Blue Jays' Class A-Advanced affiliate.\n\nOn November 1, 2012, Redmond was named manager of the Miami Marlins, and given a three-year deal. After the conclusion of the 2014 season Redmond got a contract extension until 2017.\n\nAfter struggling to start the 2015 season, rumors indicated that Marlins' owner Jeffrey Loria, was considering firing Redmond. The Marlins fired Redmond on May 17, just under an hour after the Marlins lost to the Braves, leaving the team at 16–22 on the season.\n\nOn November 16, 2016, Redmond was hired as the bench coach for the Colorado Rockies.\nAs a catcher, Redmond was known for his skill in calling the right pitches for the pitcher to throw. He was also noted for his veteran leadership and clubhouse presence. He was also known for his defensive ability. He caught R.A. Dickey and Dennis Springer, who all threw a knuckleball, considered a difficult pitch to catch. Redmond is ranked second in career fielding percentage as a catcher, finishing with 99.6%.\n\nIn 1999, Redmond won the Charlie Hough Good Guy Award. He was inducted into the Unum Portland Sea Dogs Hall of Fame in 2010, primarily because of the stellar defensive skills he exemplified during his tenure with the team and in the major leagues. However, Redmond could not attend the induction ceremony due to his family commitments.\n\nMike and his wife Michele (née Rowe) have two sons, Ryan and Michael. They live in Spokane, Washington.\n"}

On July 2, 1994, the flight encountered heavy thunderstorms and microburst-induced windshear while attempting to land, and crashed into heavy trees and a private residence near the The crash and ensuing fire caused 37 fatalities and seriously injured \n\nOn Saturday, July 2, 1994, the plane, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 registered \"N954VJ\", departed Columbia Metropolitan Airport at 18:15 EDT for the 35-minute flight to Charlotte/Douglas International Airport with Captain Mike Greenlee (38), First Officer Phil Hayes (41), three flight attendants, and 52 passengers (including two infants) on board.\nThe flight was uneventful until the approach to Charlotte, where several severe thunderstorms were in the vicinity of the airport. At 18:38, Flight 1016 was cleared by Charlotte approach control for an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to Douglas Airport's runway 18R (now 18C). The plane, flown by first officer Hayes, approached the runway in heavy rain conditions. The flight switched over to the local tower controller handling landings for runway 18R, and at 18:39, the tower controller gave Flight 1016 clearance to land. Captain Greenlee asked the tower controller for a weather report from the plane ahead of Flight 1016, a Fokker 100 that had just landed on runway 18R. The tower told Flight 1016 that the Fokker pilot reported \"smooth sailing.\" In post-crash interviews, multiple passengers and flight attendants told the NTSB that the flight seemed normal until the plane entered a storm with heavy rain while on final approach.\n\nAt 18:40, a tower controller issued a windshear warning to all aircraft, but on a different radio frequency than that used by Flight 1016. About a minute later, as Flight 1016 was on final approach, the captain, realizing that his aircraft was in a serious predicament, attempted to abort the landing by instructing the first officer to \"take it around, go to the right\". The captain then radioed the control tower and stated \"USAir ten sixteen's on the go\"; the tower acknowledged the missed approach and cleared Flight 1016 to climb to . The plane struggled to climb due to the severe weather conditions, veered to the right and rapidly descended. The flight crew desperately tried to control the airplane as it plummeted toward the ground. It was later determined that the wind shear alert system did not alert them with a red indicator and aural warning because of a software discrepancy that lowered the sensitivity while the flaps were in transit from 40 degrees to 15 degrees during the go around procedure. A Honeywell engineer stated that the pilots should have received a warning 8–9 seconds before impact.\n\nAt 18:42 EDT, the DC-9 touched down in a field within the airport boundary, about from the threshold of runway 18R. It then crashed through the airport fence and impacted several trees, breaking apart while skidding down a residential street that was on the airport boundary. The plane broke into four major sections; the front of the airplane, including the cockpit and the unoccupied first class passenger cabin, came to rest in the middle of Wallace Neel Road. The rear section of the fuselage, including the tail and the rear-mounted engines, came to rest in the carport of a house.\n\nOf the 52 passengers on board, 37 died due to blunt force trauma, burns from the fire, or carbon monoxide inhalation. An additional 14 passengers suffered serious injuries, and one had minor injuries. Of the five crew members, both pilots suffered minor injuries, two flight attendants were seriously injured and the remaining flight attendant sustained minor injuries. No one on the ground was injured.\n\nThe airport's previous major incident was twenty years earlier, Eastern Air Lines Flight 212, also a DC-9, in September 1974.\n\nThe NTSB immediately dispatched an investigation team, which recovered the CVR and FDR from the plane's wreckage. After a lengthy investigation by the NTSB, it was concluded that a microburst had been generated by the thunderstorm that was over the airport at the time of the crash. The NTSB listed these contributing factors:\n\n\nThe Flight 1016 crash is discussed in a \"Mayday\" (\"Air Disasters\" in the U.S.) television series episode, \"Racing the Storm\" (S1E2), about American Airlines Flight 1420, which also crashed while landing in inclement weather. The accident was later featured in \"Mayday\" episode \"Storming Out\" (S17E6). Flight 1016 was also the subject of an episode of \"The Unexplained\", a Biography Channel series.\n\n\n"}

Perov was an illegitimate son of the local procurator baron, Baron Gregor Gustav Friedrich von Krüdener, who belonged to a German and Baltic German noble family, which belonged to the Uradel, and Akulina Ivanova, a native citizen of Tobolsk. Although Perov's parents married soon after his birth, there was no legal way to inherit his father's name and baron title, so he was registered under his godfather's surname — Vasiliev. He later changed his surname to Perov — a nickname given to him by his teacher who taught him calligraphy as a child (the word \"pero\" means \"feather\" in Russian).\n\nAfter completing a course at Arzamas uyezd school, Perov was transferred to the \"Alexander Stupin art school\" also located in Arzamas. In 1853, Perov was admitted to the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in Moscow, where he learned from several renowned artists.\n\nIn 1856, Perov was awarded with a minor silver medal for his sketch of a boy's head, presented to the Imperial Academy of Arts. Later the Academy gave him many other awards: in 1857 a major silver medal for \"Commissary of Rural Police Investigating\", a minor golden medal for the \"Scene on a Grave\" and the \"Son of a Dyak Promoted to First Rank\", and in 1861 a major golden medal for \"Sermon in a Village\".\nIn 1862, after receiving the right to a state-paid trip abroad together with a golden medal, Perov travelled to Western Europe, visiting several German cities, and then Paris. During this time he created paintings depicting scenes from European streetlife, such as the \"Vendor of statuettes\", the \"Savoyard\", the \"Organ-Grinder in Paris\", the \"Musicians and the Bystanders\", and the \"Paris Ragpickers\".\nReturning to Moscow early, from 1865 to 1871 Perov created his best known pieces, \"The Queue at The Fountain\", \"A Meal in the Monastery\", \"Last Journey\", \"Troika\", the \"Lent Monday\", \"Arrival of a New Governess in a Merchant House\", the \"Drawing Teacher\", \"A Scene at the Railroad\", the \"Last Tavern at Town Gate\", the \"Birdcatcher\", the \"Fisherman\", and the \"Hunters at Rest\". \nIn 1866, Perov received the title of an academician, and in 1871 the position of a Professor at Moscow School of Arts, Sculpture and Architecture. It was around this period that Perov joined the Peredvizhniki, a collective of Russian realist painters formed as an artists cooperative in protest of academic restrictions.\n\nPerov died on 10 June (29 May O.S.), 1882 in the village Kuzminki, now Kuzminki District of Moscow) from tuberculosis, and his body was interred at the Donskoy Cemetery.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "1922517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922517", "title": "Dynaco", "text": "Dynaco\n\nFounded by David Hafler and Ed Laurent in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1955, Dynaco was an American hi-fi audio system manufacturer popular in the 1960s and 1970s for its wide range of affordable, yet high quality audio components.. Its best known product was the ST-70 tube stereo amplifier. They also manufactured other tube and solid state amplifiers, preamplifiers, radio tuners and bookshelf loudspeakers. Dynaco was liquidated in 1980, and the trademark is now owned by Radial Engineering Ltd.\n\nIn 1950 David Hafler and Herb Keroes started a Philadelphia-based company called Acrosound to build and sell audio-quality output transformers, primarily for home electronics hobbyists. The two men refined and developed the ultra-linear audio circuit pioneered by British audio electronics engineer Alan Blumlein, using taps from the output transformer to feed signal back into the output stage screen grid circuitry. The Acrosound transformer circuit was later used in many home-built and commercial hi-fi amplifiers in the early 1950s. In order to appeal to a wider consumer market, Hafler decided to design and build entire power amplifiers as build-it-yourself kits, complete with preassembled, tested circuit boards that only required the customer to wire the boards to the transformers, controls, and power supply to complete the project. This was a considerable advance over other audio system kits of the day, which generally required the purchaser to assemble and test the PC boards themselves, a relatively precise and time-consuming task. \n\nIn 1954 Dave Hafler and Herb Keroes parted company. During a visit to the New York-based Brociner Electronics the same year, Hafler met an audio engineer named Ed Laurent, who had designed a novel single-tube driver circuit for a power amplifier. In 1955, the two men founded the Dyna Company (later \"Dynaco\") with the intention of not only producing transformers, but high-quality audio circuitry. The company was incorporated in October 1955, with business premises located at 617 N. 41st St in Philadelphia. Dynaco's first product was the Mk. II 50-watt power amplifier. Available as a kit or preassembled unit, the Mk. II was sold for several years until its replacement in 1956 by the Mk. III amplifier, which produced 60 watts. Hafler wrote an article for Radio-Electronics Magazine in 1955 delineating the design of a high-power version of the Williamson amplifier using ultra-linear circuitry and Dynaco's new output transformers. The \"Williamson\" amplifier utilized a slightly different circuit design from the Mk. II and Mk. III. Shortly thereafter, the company moved its business operations to 3912 Powelton Avenue in Philadelphia, where they remained for several years.\n\nToday, Dynaco is best remembered for its highly regarded vacuum tube stereo amplifier, the Stereo 70 (ST 70). Introduced in 1959, the ST 70 was available as a kit (Dynakit) intended for assembly by the purchaser or as a complete factory-wired unit. The ST 70 used four EL34 output tubes, one GZ34/5AR4 rectifier tube, two 7199 input (driver) tubes, two output transformers, one power transformer, and a preassembled printed circuit board (PCB) containing the driver circuit. It produced 35 watts per channel. The driver circuit had a single 7199 pentode/triode tube per channel, and used the driver tube to handle both voltage amplification and phase splitting. The output transformers are an ultralinear design, whereby part of the primary winding is fed back to the output tube's screen grid. This design reduced distortion and improved audio quality. \n\nA masterpiece of efficient circuit design, the ST 70 provided reliable, high-quality audio amplification at an affordable price. The popularity of the ST 70 contributed more than any other single product to continuing consumer interest in tube-based stereo amplifiers at a time of increasing market dominance by solid state audio products. Because of its excellent value for cost, Dynaco tube amplifiers were often referred to as \"the poor man's McIntosh.\" More than 350,000 ST-70 amplifiers had been sold when production finally ceased, making the ST 70 the most popular tube power amplifier ever made. \n\nA smaller tube amplifier, the 17.5wpc Stereo 35, was introduced in 1963, and was followed the next year by the SCA 35, the company's first integrated (preamp + power amp) tube amplifier. In 1992, an updated version of the Stereo 70, the Stereo 70 II, was produced by Sound Valves for Panor Corporation. Even today, upgraded components, rebuilding kits, and complete tube amplifiers using the basic Stereo 70 design are still in production, and the ST 70 has inspired numerous other amplifier designs, such as Ars-Sonum's \"Filarmonia SE\". Dynaco continued to build both mono and stereo amplifiers until 1977.\n\nThe company's final contribution to vacuum tube technology was the massive Mk. VI mono power amplifier of 1976, which produced 120 watts (continuous). \nIn later years, the company began to produce a line of solid-state audio components, commencing in 1966 with the introduction of the Stereo 120 power amplifier (60 wpc). Because of early problems involving circuit, power supply, and transistor failures, the ST 120 was not as popular as earlier Dynaco tube amplifiers. Numerous small circuit changes were introduced by Dynaco over the years in an attempt to improve the stability and reliability of the ST 120, without much success. With the PAT-4 preamplifier in 1967, the company affirmed its ability to design reliable solid state equipment at an affordable price. In 1969 the Dynaquad 4-channel matrix decoder system was introduced, helping to start the quadrophonic sound craze. In the 1970s, the Stereo 400 was developed and marketed. This was a high power amplifier at 200 watts per channel that offered automatic protection circuitry to prevent electrical destruction of the loudspeaker. The FM-5 tuner was offered as was the SCA-80 integrated amplifier in the early 1970s time line. Dynaco's solid-state kits were different from the popular Heathkit products (and Dynaco's own vacuum tube kits) because of their preassembled circuit boards. These boards were wired at the factory, tested and packaged with the unassembled chassis. It remained only for the consumer to attach the switches and controls to the chassis pieces, assemble the chassis and power supply, and solder connecting wires to the circuit boards. This saved considerable time and reduced error in assembly.\n\nDynaco also distributed the famous SEAS 'A-Series' of bookshelf loudspeakers that were manufactured in Denmark, using input from Dynaco's David Hafler and SEAS's Ragnar Lian. The A-Series were marketed between from 1970 until Dynaco's demise in the 1980s. The Dynaco A-25 model proved to be extremely successful, selling between 600,000 and 1,000,000 units. A modified aperiodic bass reflex design using SEAS speakers in a handsome wood cabinet, the A-25 sold for $79.95 each in 1969 making it competitive with much more expensive loudspeakers. The patented aperiodic (essentially non-resonant) woofer design utilized a highly damped vent instead of a reflex port, whose acoustic resistance is very carefully controlled. The resistant venting action lowered the \"Q\" of the system and reduced impedance variation near resonance in the A-Series speakers. Dynaco followed the A-25 with the slightly larger A-35, which featured a dual-chambered, non-vented design in a walnut-veneered cabinet with even greater transparency and fidelity. Over time, Dynaco marketed a wide range of loudspeakers, ranging from the small A-10 model to the floor standing A-50 series. After some 30 years, these loudspeakers still command good prices in markets such as eBay, and are a testimonial to their quality. \n\nConcurrent with A-25 production, Dynaco introduced the QD-1 speaker adapter which synthesized 4-channel sound from the stereo amplifier output. This \"Dynaco patent\" required a single resistor and a threeway potentiometer for the two rear speakers, generating phase difference signals for a feeling of ambience. The system worked best when the stereo sound had been recorded via two bidirectional microphones on the same spot. When microphone set-up changed to the use of multiple directional microphones and multitrack tape recording and postprocessing (i.c. in the CD era), the QD-1 was less effective.\n\nDynaco became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tyco, Inc. in 1969. David Hafler remained with the company a few years longer, but left in 1974 to join Ortofon, manufacturer and importer of high-end phono cartridges. In 1977, Hafler founded the Hafler Company, continuing the tradition of high quality but inexpensive kits and assembled hi-fi gear. \n\nIn the late 1970s, Dynaco released a short-lived set of new loudspeakers developed by Ed Laurent, the \"Phase III\". The speakers were well regarded by the audiophile community, but their introduction was apparently too late to make any strong impression in the marketplace, and Ed Laurent left shortly afterward to join SEAS Corporation. After Dynaco closed its USA operations, its former Canadian subsidiary released the Dynaco A-150, A-250, and A-350 speakers, all manufactured in Canton, Massachusetts. Critical reviews of the new audio speakers were not favorable, and they disappeared from the market in the mid-1980s.\n\nDynaco was acquired by ESS Labs, LLC in 1979; the Dynaco division was closed in 1980 and its assets acquired by Stereo Cost Cutters (later called Sound Valuesand Sound Valves).\n\nIn 1991 the Pan Orient Corporation (later Panor Corporation) acquired the Dynaco trademark, and in 1993 began marketing electronic audio components with the Dynaco brand. Panor introduced some new products, such as the Stereo 70 II. Panor/Dynaco's most ambitious stereo tube amplifier was the Stereo 160, a 75 wpc, all-tube stereo power amplifier with switchable pentode/triode modes, adjustable tube bias potentiometers, and 6550 output tubes.\n\nWhile Panor owns the Dynaco brand name and trademark, there is no longer any direct connection with the company founded by David Hafler.\n\nDynaco introduced tube audio amplifiers, tuners, and preamplifiers between 1955 and 1976.\n\n\n"}

She was arrested with Bušić in 1976 after hijacking TWA Flight 355 and sentenced to life in prison, with early parole.\n\nAccording to her memoir, she was born in Eugene, Oregon, USA and was raised in Portland, Oregon. She graduated from the University of Oregon, attended Vienna University (Austria), and obtained a master's degree in German language, literature, and linguistics at Portland State University. In Oregon, she worked as a nurse's aid, teacher, and mental health therapist for abused teenagers.\n\nShe married Zvonko Bušić in 1972 and they lived together in Austria, Germany, Oregon, and Ohio before moving to New York City. They were active in publicizing human rights abuses in the former Yugoslavia, especially the murder of Croatian dissidents by the Yugoslav secret police organization UDBA in the so-called \"black program,\" and in promoting the cause of Croatian independence. Julienne Bušić and a friend were imprisoned briefly in Zagreb in the early 1970s for disseminating literature critical of the Yugoslavian government.\n\nOn September 10, 1976, she, her husband, and three others hijacked domestic Trans World Airlines flight 355 departing from New York for Chicago, using the threat of a bomb. While refueling the hijacked plane at Montreal's Mirabel International Airport, they told officials that they had planted a bomb in a locker at Grand Central Terminal and gave them instructions on finding it. They demanded that an appeal to the American people concerning Croatia's independence be printed in the \"New York Times\", the \"Washington Post\", the \"Chicago Tribune\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", and the \"International Herald Tribune\". The plane was then flown to Gander, Newfoundland, where 35 of its passengers were released. From there the plane was accompanied by a larger TWA plane that guided it to Keflavík, Iceland. The hijackers' initial European destination was London, but the British government refused them permission to land.\n\nDuring the hijacking the device at Grand Central Terminal was found and taken to Rodman's Neck Firing Range where police attempted to dismantle it rather than detonate it. This bomb exploded, killing NYPD officer Brian Murray and wounding another, Terrence McTigue. They hijackers had the airliner fly over London, where they dropped pamphlets promoting Croatian independence from Yugoslavia. The group surrendered without bloodshed, with their onboard bomb proving be a harmless pressure cooker.\n\nZvonko and Julienne Bušić were convicted of air piracy resulting in death, which carried a mandatory life sentence with parole eligibility after 10 years. In 1979, she was attacked in prison by Manson Family member Lynette Fromme. She was released from federal prison in 1989 after serving 13 years in the minimum security Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin in Dublin, California.\n\nDuring and after her stint in prison, Bušić corresponded at length with Kathleen Murray Moran, the wife of the bomb squad member killed during the incident. Murray Moran advocated for Bušić's early release. Murray Moran would later, quite publicly, regret that advocacy. In 1982, Murray filed a lawsuit against the NYPD, charging gross negligence in the handling of the explosives, which \"caused the death of Officer\nMurray\".\n\nBušić subsequently moved to Croatia and has supported Croatian political causes in the United States and Europe. She has been involved in publishing, translation, and literary projects, and written for literary journals both in Croatia and the United States, including Ooligan Press, Verbatim, Gobshite Quarterly, and Vijenac. She is also a weekly columnist for the Croatian news portal Dalje. Her husband was granted parole in 2008, at which time he rejoined his wife in Croatia. Zvonko Bušić committed suicide in 2013.\n\nIn January 2020 she took part in a \nHDZ ad to support the re-election of Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic as President of Croatia.\n\nHer first book, \"Lovers and Madmen\" (2000), chronicles her relationship with Zvonko and the death threats and attempts on their lives that led up to the hijacking. Her second book, \"Your Blood and Mine\" (2008), is an extended commentary on the American federal prison system, as portrayed by her letters to Zvonko throughout his 32-year incarceration. Her third book, \"Living Cells\" (2012) is a true story of a Croatian woman held as a sex slave during the siege of Vukovar.\n\nBušić is featured prominently in the radio show Unforgiven.

He was her private art tutor, and the two maintained an educational relationship through correspondence until she was 18. Rose's mother, Maria La Touche, had written to Ruskin for assistance with her children's education after a formal introduction from her friend Louisa, Lady Waterford. Ruskin recalls the correspondence in \"Praeterita\":\n\nSoon after I returned home, in the eventful year 1858, a lady wrote to me from—somewhere near Green Street, W.,—saying, as people sometimes did, in those days, that she saw I was the only sound teacher in Art; but this farther, very seriously, that she wanted her children—two girls and a boy—taught the beginnings of Art rightly; especially the younger girl, in whom she thought I might find some power worth developing.\n\nAlthough some debate exists over the nature of Ruskin's first correspondence with Maria La Touche, Tim Hilton notes in \"John Ruskin: The Early Years\" that he did not call as immediately as his autobiography suggests. Rather, \"he sent William Ward to see her, being too busy to call himself\".\n\nWhen Ruskin did call on the La Touches for the first time, he was \"taken with them\" and \"felt there was something exceptional about Rose\". Upon first meeting Rose, Ruskin wrote in the final pages of \"Praeterita\" that\n\npresently the drawing room door opened, and Rosie came in, quietly taking stock of me with her blue eyes as she walked across the room; gave me her hand, as a good dog gives its paw, and then stood a little back. Nine years old, on 3 January 1858, thus now rising towards ten; neither tall nor short for her age; a little stiff in her way of standing. The eyes rather deep blue at that time, and fuller and softer than afterwards. Lips perfectly lovely in profile;--a little too wide, and hard in edge, seen in front; the rest of the features what a fair, well-bred Irish girl's usually are; the hair, perhaps, more graceful in short curl around the forehead, and softer than one sees often, in the close-bound tresses above the neck.\nShe was a high-spirited, precocious, but also very childlike adolescent. Tim Hilton writes that\n\nThe Irish girl [Rose] was a puzzle, for she was precocious in some ways and not in others. Sometimes she had a surprising understanding of adult attitudes: at the next moment she was once more completely a child. She had a pretty way of making herself engaging, even coquettish, but could also be rather solemn. 'I don't know what to make of her', Ruskin confessed. '...She wears her round hat in the sauciest way possible—and is a firm—fiery little thing.'\n\nRuskin's interest in Rose grew into fascination and adoration for his pupil and their interaction consisted of extraordinary amounts of correspondence. In fact, Ruskin's first letter from Rose impressed him so much that he reprinted it in its entirety in \"Praeterita\". Writing\n\nSome wise, and prettily mannered, people have told me I shouldn't say anything about Rosie at all. But I am too old now to take advice, and I won't have this following letter—the first she ever wrote me—moulder away, when I can read it no more, lost to all loving hearts.\n\nThe letter Rose writes is addressed \"Dearest St. Crumpet\"—\"St. Crumpet\" being her pet name for him—and contains sweet, affection, attentive notes about how much she and her family thought about Ruskin during their travels:\n\nI wish so very much that you were happy—God can make you so—We will try not to forget all you taught us—It was so nice of you. Thank you so much from both of us.--Mama is very glad you went to Dr. Ferguson[.] She says you must not give him up. How very kind of you to see & talk to our old man[.] Certainly the name is not beautiful[.] We have all read your letter & we all care for it[.] That was indeed a \"dear Irish labourer.\" Will you give them our love please & take for yourself as much as ever you please. It will be a great deal if you deign to take all we send you. I like Nice, but I don't much like being transplanted except going home. I am ever your rose.\nAlthough much speculation exists over when Ruskin \"fell in love\" with Rose, most critics maintain that she was between the ages of 14–18.\n\nThe author George MacDonald was entrusted by her parents to oversee Rose's welfare during their absence, and he served as a go-between for Ruskin and Rose, acting as their closest friend and advisor. Rose's parents refused permission for Ruskin to marry their daughter after being warned about him by Ruskin's first wife, Effie Gray, whose 6-year marriage to Ruskin had ended in annulment due to \"non-consummation\". They were primarily motivated by concern that should Rose ultimately become pregnant by Ruskin, their marriage might be invalidated, since the reason for the annulment of Ruskin's first marriage, his \"incurable impotence\", would have been disproved.\n\nRuskin repeated his marriage proposal after Rose became legally free to decide for herself, but she still refused. She was willing to marry if the union would remain unconsummated, as was Ruskin's first marriage, because her doctors had told her she was unfit for marriage; but Ruskin declined to enter another such marriage for fear of its effect on his reputation.\n\nRose died in 1875 at the age of 27, in a Dublin nursing home, where she had been placed by her parents. Various authors describe the death as arising from either madness, anorexia, a broken heart, religious mania or hysteria, or a combination of these. Whatever the cause, her death was tragic and it is generally credited with causing the onset of bouts of insanity in Ruskin from around 1877. He convinced himself that the Renaissance painter Vittore Carpaccio had included portraits of Rose in his paintings of the life of Saint Ursula. He also took solace in Spiritualism, trying to contact Rose's spirit.\n\nRose and Ruskin's romance is alluded to in Nabokov's novel \"Lolita\". According to Wolfgang Kemp \"the whole work is riddled with allusions and direct references to the la Touches\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1922545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922545", "title": "Blue-faced honeyeater", "text": "Blue-faced honeyeater\n\nThe blue-faced honeyeater (\"Entomyzon cyanotis\"), also colloquially known as the bananabird, is a passerine bird of the honeyeater family, Meliphagidae. It is the only member of its genus, and it is most closely related to honeyeaters of the genus \"Melithreptus\". Three subspecies are recognised. At around in length, the blue-faced species is large for a honeyeater. Its plumage is distinctive, with olive upperparts, white underparts, and a black head and throat with white nape and cheeks. Males and females are similar in external appearance. Adults have a blue area of bare skin on each side of the face readily distinguishing them from juveniles, which have yellow or green patches of bare skin.\n\nFound in open woodland, parks and gardens, the blue-faced honeyeater is common in northern and eastern Australia, and southern New Guinea. It appears to be sedentary in parts of its range, and locally nomadic in other parts; however, the species has been little studied. Its diet is mostly composed of invertebrates, supplemented with nectar and fruit. They often take over and renovate old babbler nests, in which the female lays and incubates two or rarely three eggs.\n\nThe blue-faced honeyeater was first described by ornithologist John Latham in his 1801 work, \"Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae\". However, he described it as three separate species, seemingly not knowing it was the same bird in each case: the blue-eared grackle (\"Gracula cyanotis\"), the blue-cheeked bee-eater (\"Merops cyanops\"), and the blue-cheeked thrush (\"Turdus cyanous\"). It was as the blue-cheeked bee-eater that it was painted between 1788 and 1797 by Thomas Watling, one of a group known collectively as the Port Jackson Painter. It was reclassified in the genus \"Entomyzon\", which was erected by William Swainson in 1825. He observed that the \"Blue-faced Grakle\" was the only insectivorous member of the genus, and posited that it was a link between the smaller honeyeaters and the riflebirds of the genus \"Ptiloris\". The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek \"ento-/εντο\"- 'inside' and \"myzein/μυζειν\" 'to drink' or 'suck'. The specific epithet, \"cyanotis\", means 'blue-eared', and combines \"cyano-/κυανο\" 'blue' with \"otis\" (a Latinised form of \"ωτος\", the Greek genitive of \"ous/ους\") 'ear'. Swainson spelt it \"Entomiza\" in an 1837 publication, and George Gray wrote \"Entomyza\" in 1840.\n\nThe blue-faced honeyeater is generally held to be the only member of the genus, although its plumage suggests an affinity with honeyeaters of the genus \"Melithreptus\". It has been classified in that genus by Glen Storr, although others felt it more closely related to wattlebirds (\"Anthochaera\") or miners (\"Manorina\"). A 2004 molecular study has resolved that it is closely related to \"Melithreptus\" after all. Molecular clock estimates indicate that the blue-faced honeyeater diverged from the \"Melithreptus\" honeyeaters somewhere between 12.8 and 6.4 million years ago, in the Miocene epoch. It differs from them in its much larger size, brighter plumage, more gregarious nature, and larger patch of bare facial skin.\n\nMolecular analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea.\n\nEarly naturalist George Shaw had called it the blue-faced honey-sucker in 1826. Other common names include \"white-quilled honeyeater\", and \"blue-eye\". Its propensity for feeding on the flowers and fruit of bananas in north Queensland has given it the common name of \"banana-bird\". A local name from Mackay in central Queensland is \"pandanus-bird\", as it is always found around \"Pandanus\" palms there. It is called \"morning-bird\" from its dawn calls before other birds of the bush. \"Gympie\" is a Queensland bushman's term. Thomas Watling noted a local indigenous name was \"der-ro-gang\". John Hunter recorded the term \"gugurruk\" (pron. \"co-gurrock\"), but the term was also applied to the black-shouldered kite (\"Elanus axillaris\"). It is called (\"minha\") \"yeewi\" in Pakanh, where \"minha\" is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal', and (\"inh\"-)\"ewelmb\" in Uw Oykangand and Uw Olkola, where \"inh-\" is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal', in three aboriginal languages of central Cape York Peninsula\n\nThree subspecies are recognised:\n\nA large honeyeater ranging from and averaging in length. The adult blue-faced honeyeater has a wingspan of and weighs around . In general shape, it has broad wings with rounded tips and a medium squarish tail. The sturdy, slightly downcurved bill is shorter than the skull, and measures in length. It is easily recognised by the bare blue skin around its eyes. The head and throat are otherwise predominantly blackish with a white stripe around the nape and another from the cheek. The upperparts, including mantle, back and wings, are a golden-olive colour, and the margins of the primary and secondary coverts a darker olive-brown, while the underparts are white. Juveniles that have just fledged have grey head, chin, and central parts of their breasts, with brown upperparts, and otherwise white underparts. After their next moult, they more closely resemble adults and have similar plumage, but are distinguished by their facial patches. The bare facial skin of birds just fledged is yellow, sometimes with a small patch of blue in front of the eyes, while the skin of birds six months and older has usually become more greenish, and turns darker blue beneath the eye, before assuming the adult blue facial patch by around 16 months of age. The blue-faced honeyeater begins its moult in October or November, starting with its primary flight feathers, replacing them by February. It replaces its body feathers anywhere from December to June, and tail feathers between December and July. 422 blue-faced honeyeaters have been banded between 1953 and 1997 to monitor movements and longevity. Of these, 109 were eventually recovered, 107 of which were within of their point of banding. The record for longevity was a bird banded in May 1990 in Kingaroy in central Queensland, which was found dead on a road after 8 years and 3.5 months in September 1998, around away.\n\nThe blue-faced honeyeater produces a variety of calls, including a piping call around half an hour before dawn, variously described as \"ki-owt\", \"woik\", \"queet\", \"peet\", or \"weet\". Through the day, it makes squeaking noises while flying, and harsh squawks when mobbing. Its calls have been likened to those of the yellow-throated miner (\"Manorina flavigula\"), but are deeper. Blue-faced honeyeaters make a soft chirping around nestlings and family members.\n\nA distinctive bird, the blue-faced honeyeater differs in coloration from the duller-plumaged friarbirds, miners and wattlebirds, and it is much larger than the similarly coloured \"Melithreptus\" honeyeaters. Subspecies \"albipennis\", with its white wing-patch, has been likened to a khaki-backed butcherbird in flight.\n\nThe blue-faced honeyeater is found from the Kimberleys in northwestern Australia eastwards across the Top End and into Queensland, where it is found from Cape York south across the eastern and central parts of the state, roughly east of a line connecting Karumba, Blackall, Cunnamulla and Currawinya National Park. It has a patchy distribution in New South Wales, occurring in the Northern Rivers and Northern Tablelands regions, and along the coast south to Nambucca Heads. To the south, it is generally absent from the Central and South Coast, and is instead found west of the Great Divide across the South West Slopes and Riverina to the Murray River. It is common in northern Victoria and reaches Bordertown in southeastern South Australia, its range continuing along the Murray. It is also found in the Grampians region, particularly in the vicinity of Stawell, Ararat and St Arnaud, with rare reports from southwestern Victoria. The species occasionally reaches Adelaide, and there is a single record from the Eyre Peninsula. The altitude ranges from sea level to around , or rarely .\n\nIn New Guinea, it is found from Merauke in the far southeast of Indonesia's Papua province and east across the Trans-Fly region of southwestern Papua New Guinea. It has also been recorded from the Aru Islands.\n\nThe blue-faced honeyeater appears to be generally sedentary within its range, especially in much of the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. However, in many places (generally south of the Tropic of Capricorn), populations may be present or absent at different times of the year, although this appears to result from nomadic, rather than seasonal, migratory movements. Around Wellington in central New South Wales, birds were recorded over winter months, and were more common in autumn around the Talbragar River. Birds were present all year round near Inverell in northern New South Wales, but noted to be flying eastwards from January to May, and westwards in June and July. In Jandowae in southeastern Queensland, birds were regularly recorded flying north and east from March to June, and returning south and west in July and August, and were absent from the area in spring and summer.\n\nThey live throughout rainforest, dry sclerophyll (\"Eucalyptus\") forest, open woodland, \"Pandanus\" thickets, paperbarks, mangroves, watercourses, and wetter areas of semi-arid regions, as well as parks, gardens, and golf courses in urban areas. The understory in eucalypt-dominated woodland, where the blue-faced honeyeater is found, is most commonly composed of grasses, such as \"Triodia\", but sometimes it is made up of shrubs or small trees, such as grevilleas, paperbarks, wattles, Cooktown ironwood (\"Erythrophleum chlorostachys\") or billygoat plum (\"Terminalia ferdinandiana\"). One study in Kakadu National Park found that blue-faced honeyeaters inhabited mixed stands of eucalypts and \"Pandanus\", but were missing from pure stands of either plant.\n\nThe social organisation of the blue-faced honeyeater has been little studied to date. Encountered in pairs, family groups or small flocks, blue-faced honeyeaters sometimes associate with groups of yellow-throated miners (\"Manorina flavigula\"). They mob potential threats, such as goshawks (\"Accipiter\" spp.), rufous owls (\"Ninox rufa\"), and Pacific koels (\"Eudynamys orientalis\"). There is some evidence of cooperative breeding, with some breeding pairs recorded with one or more helper birds. Parents will dive at and harass intruders to drive them away from nest sites, including dogs, owls, goannas, and even a nankeen night-heron (\"Nycticorax caledonicus\"). A study published in 2004 of remnant patches of forest in central Queensland, an area largely cleared for agriculture, showed a reduced avian species diversity in areas frequented by blue-faced honeyeaters or noisy miners. This effect was more marked in smaller patches. The study concluded that conserved patches of woodland containing the two aggressive species should be larger than 20 ha (44 acres) to preserve diversity.\n\nSocial birds, blue-faced honeyeaters can be noisy when they congregate. When feeding in groups, birds seem to keep in contact with each other by soft chirping calls. In Mackay, a bird would fly up above the treetops calling excitedly to its flock, which would follow and fly around in what was likened to an aerial corroboree, seemingly at play. A single bird was recorded aping and playing with an immature Australian magpie (\"Gymnorhina tibicen\") in Proserpine, Queensland. The blue-faced honeyeater has been reported to be fond of bathing; a flock of 15–20 birds was observed diving into pools one bird at a time, while others were perched in surrounding treetops preening.\n\nThe parasite \"Anoncotaenia globata\" (a worldwide species not otherwise recorded from Australia) was isolated from a blue-faced honeyeater collected in North Queensland in 1916. The habroneme nematode, \"Cyrnea (Procyrnea) spirali\", has also been isolated from this among other honeyeater species. The nasal mite, \"Ptilonyssus philemoni\", has been isolated from the noisy friarbird (\"Philemon corniculatus\") and blue-faced honeyeater.\n\nThe blue-faced honeyeater probably breeds throughout its range. The breeding season is from June to January, with one or two broods raised during this time. The nest is an untidy, deep bowl of sticks and bits of bark in the fork of a tree, Staghorn or bird's nest ferns, or grasstree. \"Pandanus\" palms are a popular nest site in Mackay. They often renovate and use the old nests of other species, most commonly the grey-crowned babbler (\"Pomatostomus temporalis\"), but also the chestnut-crowned babbler (\"P. ruficeps\"), other honeyeaters, including noisy (\"Philemon corniculatus\"), little (\"P. citreogularis\") and silver-crowned friarbirds (\"P. argenticeps\"), the noisy miner (\"Manorina melanocephala\") and the red wattlebird (\"Anthochaera carunculata\"), and artamids, such as the Australian magpie and butcherbird species, and even the magpie-lark. In Coen, an old babbler nest in a paperbark (\"Melaleuca\"), which had been lined with messmate bark, had been occupied by blue-faced honeyeaters and re-lined with strips of paperbark. Two or, rarely, three eggs are laid, 22 × 32 mm (1 × 1⅓ in) and buff-pink splotched with red-brown or purplish colours. The female alone incubates the eggs over a period of 16 or 17 days.\n\nLike those of all passerines, the chicks are altricial; they are born blind and covered only by sparse tufts of brown down on their backs, shoulders and parts of the wings. By four days they open their eyes, and pin feathers emerge from their wings on day six, and the rest of the body on days seven and eight. Both parents feed the young, and are sometimes assisted by helper birds. The Pacific koel (\"Eudynamys orientalis\") and pallid cuckoo (\"Cuculus pallidus\") have been recorded as brood parasites of the blue-faced honeyeater, and the laughing kookaburra recorded as preying on broods.\n\nThe blue-faced honeyeater generally forages in the branches and foliage of trees, in small groups of up to seven birds. Occasionally, larger flocks of up to 30 individuals have been reported, and the species has been encountered in a mixed-species foraging flock with the little friarbird (\"Philemon citreogularis\"). The bulk of their diet consists of insects, including cockroaches, termites, grasshoppers, bugs such as lerps, scale (Coccidae) and shield bugs (Pentatomidae), beetles such as bark beetles, chafers (subfamily Melolonthinae), click beetles (genus \"Demetrida\"), darkling beetles (genera \"Chalcopteroides\" and \"Homotrysis\"), leaf beetles (genus \"Paropsis\"), ladybirds of the genus \"Scymnus\", weevils such as the pinhole borer (\"Platypus australis\"), and members of the genera \"Mandalotus\", \"Polyphrades\" and \"Prypnus\", as well as flies, moths, bees, ants, and spiders. Blue-faced honeyeaters have been reported preying on small lizards. Prey are caught mostly by sallying, although birds also probe and glean. In Kakadu National Park, birds prefer to hunt prey between the leaf bases of the screw palm (\"Pandanus spiralis\").\nThe remainder of their diet is made up of plant material, such as pollen, berries, and nectar, from such species as grasstrees (\"Xanthorrhoea\") and scarlet gum (\"Eucalyptus phoenicea\"), and from cultivated crops, such as bananas or particularly grapes. In general, birds prefer feeding at cup-shaped sources, such as flowers of the Darwin woollybutt (\"Eucalyptus miniata\"), Darwin stringybark (\"E. tetrodonta\") and long-fruited bloodwood (\"Corymbia polycarpa\"), followed by brush-shaped inflorescences, such as banksias or melaleucas, gullet-shaped inflorescences such as grevilleas, with others less often selected.\n\nUsually very inquisitive and friendly birds, they will often invade a campsite, searching for edible items, including fruit, insects, and remnants from containers of jam or honey, and milk is particularly favoured. Parent birds feed the young on insects, fruit and nectar, and have been recorded regurgitating milk to them as well.\n\nKeeping blue-faced honeyeaters in an aviary in New South Wales requires a Class 2 Licence. Applicants must show they have appropriate housing, and at least two years' experience of keeping birds. Blue-faced honeyeaters are exhibited at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, Philadelphia Zoo, Birmingham Zoo (Alabama), and Tracy Aviary (Utah) in the United States, Chessington Zoo in England, Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland and Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Australia.\n\n"}
{"id": "1922546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922546", "title": "Ghost Whisperer", "text": "Ghost Whisperer\n\nGhost Whisperer is an American supernatural television series, which ran on CBS from September 23, 2005, to May 21, 2010.\n\nThe series follows the life of Melinda Gordon (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who has the ability to see and communicate with ghosts. While trying to live as normal a life as possible—she is married and owns an antique store—Melinda helps earthbound spirits resolve their problems and cross over into the light, or the spirit world. Her tasks are difficult and at times she struggles with people who push her away and do not believe in her gift. In addition, the ghosts are mysterious and sometimes menacing at first, and Melinda must use the clues available to her to understand the spirits' needs and help them. The show was created by John Gray and was produced by Sander/Moses Productions, executive producer, and Jennifer Love Hewitt in association with ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.\n\nOn May 18, 2010, CBS canceled the show after five seasons.\n\nMelinda Gordon (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is a young woman from the town of Grandview, New York, who has the ability to see and communicate with the dead. Melinda lives with her husband, Jim Clancy (David Conrad), and later their son Aiden (Connor Gibbs). She owns a shop called \"Same as It Never Was\". Each ghost seeks Melinda's help in relaying a message or completing a task that will put their spirit to rest, and allow them to cross over into the light. Those who died with unfinished business become earthbound and cannot cross over, and Melinda, as their earthly representative, helps them to find peace. The show does not present the ghosts as having sinned; rather it is the spirits' own guilt that condemns them, and their own fear of judgment that keeps them from \"crossing over\" into an afterlife.\n\nThe series also starred Aisha Tyler as Andrea Marino, Melinda's best friend, who runs the antique shop with her. Andrea is killed in the first-season finale. During the second season, Melinda meets Delia Banks (Camryn Manheim), a struggling real estate agent who forms a friendship with Melinda and who eventually agrees to run the antique shop with her. Delia is shocked to find out about Melinda's abilities; in fact, at first she claims Melinda needs psychological help. Delia eventually accepts Melinda's gift, though she remains skeptical at times. Delia has a son named Ned Banks (Tyler Patrick Jones seasons 2–3, Christoph Sanders thereafter) who finds out about Melinda's gift long before his mother does.\n\nMelinda also forms a friendship with Rick Payne (Jay Mohr), a professor at Rockland University. He helps Melinda solve the conflicts of ghosts throughout the second and third seasons. He departs in the fourth-season premiere for an expedition in the Himalayas. The same episode introduced Eli James (Jamie Kennedy), another professor at the university, who goes through a near-death experience which unlocks an ability to hear ghosts. Unlike Melinda, he cannot see them. He becomes a close friend to Melinda and helps her investigate the hauntings.\n\n\n\"Ghost Whisperer\" is based in part on the work of Mary Ann Winkowski. Development of the show dates back to at least two years before its premiere. James Van Praagh was a co-executive producer and consultant on the show.\n\nThe show was produced by Sander/Moses Productions in association with CBS Television Studios (originally Paramount Network Television in season one and ABC Studios (originally Touchstone Television in the first two seasons) and CBS Paramount Network Television in seasons two and three.\n\nThe show was filmed on the Universal Studios back lot in Los Angeles. One area on the lot is Courthouse Square from the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, though it has been drastically modified to depict Grandview. For example, the clock tower in \"Back to the Future\" has been completely covered up. The front of Melinda and Jim's house is also the same set used by the Finch family in the film adaptation of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\". Cast and crew members said they believed that the set got visits from real spirits. After the show's cancellation and shortly before the sets were torn down, Jennifer Love Hewitt filmed a tour demonstrating the ways in which the areas were different from those shown in the TV broadcast.\n\nSound effects were completed at Smart Post Sound. Visual effects for the pilot and some season one episodes were completed at Flash Film Works. Visual effects for nearly the entire series were created at Eden FX. Roy Forge Smith, who frequently collaborated with John Gary, was the production designer on 44 episodes of the show, spanning two season, from 2005 to 2007.\n\nCreator John Gray grew up in Brooklyn, New York, which is not far from Grand View-On-Hudson (also called Grand View), west of the Hudson River. Piermont is often referenced in episodes as the neighboring town, which is accurate to real life as Grand View is actually located just north of Piermont. Professors Rick Payne and Eli James worked at the fictional \"Rockland University\", and, perhaps not coincidentally, the actual village of Grand View is a village located in Rockland County, New York.\n\nSeason one premiered on September 23, 2005, and ended on May 5, 2006. It received an average of 10.20million viewers. Season two of \"Ghost Whisperer\" premiered on September 22, 2006, and ended on May 11, 2007, again airing Friday nights on CBS during the same timeslot. CBS officially renewed the show for a third season placing it in its regular Friday 8 p.m. ET time slot. The third season premiered September 28, 2007. Twelve episodes were completed before the Writers Guild of America strike, and once the strike ended, CBS had announced that the show would return April 4, 2008, with six episodes. On February 15, 2008, CBS renewed \"Ghost Whisperer\" for a fourth season. For the fourth season, Jamie Kennedy joined the cast as Psychology professor Eli James. Jay Mohr left after the first episode as the plot had his character, Professor Rick Payne, going on sabbatical (Mohr took a role in \"Gary Unmarried\"). Recurring cast member Christoph Sanders joined as a regular cast member. The fourth season of \"Ghost Whisperer\" premiered on Friday, October 3, 2008, and concluded on May 15, 2009, and consisted of 23 episodes. In an interview by P.K. Simonds with E! Online, it was announced that \"Ghost Whisperer\" would return for a fifth season. CBS renewed \"Ghost Whisperer\" for the fifth season on May 20, 2009, which began airing on Friday, September 25, 2009, at 8 p.m. ET and ran for 22 episodes.\n\nOn May 5, 2008, it was announced that the first three seasons of \"Ghost Whisperer\" were purchased for $169.8million ($700,000 per episode, per network) for syndication by SyFy, Ion Television, and . Episodes began airing in mid-2009 on ION, and in the third quarter of 2009 on SyFy and We. The first four seasons began airing in syndication on CBC Television in Canada on August 31, 2009.\n\nThe Region 1 DVD releases are distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment/CBS DVD, while releases in all other regions are distributed by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (formerly Buena Vista Home Entertainment).\n\nOn March 17, 2015, CBS DVD released \"Ghost Whisperer- The Complete series\" on DVD in Region 1.\n\nThe series is available to stream on The CW's free digital-only network, CW Seed.\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\nEpisodes in the first half of the fourth season won their time slot every week in viewers, and across all age demographics, including the 18–49 age bracket, and also usually won the night for CBS as the most-watched show on Friday nights. Furthermore, fourteen episodes from Season 4 surpassed 10million viewers, with another seven surpassing 11million viewers.\n\nOn May 18, 2010, citing rising costs and a decline in viewership, CBS announced that \"Ghost Whisperer\" would not be renewed for another season. ABC expressed interest in picking up \"Ghost Whisperer\" for the 2010–11 U.S. television season; however, on May 27, 2010, Michael Ausiello reported that ABC had passed on renewing \"Ghost Whisperer\" for a sixth season.\n\nIn 2010, \"Zap2it\" declared \"Ghost Whisperer\" the second \"most missed axed show\" after a poll determined 19.4 percent of voters would miss it.\n\nIn October 2010, Jennifer Love Hewitt thanked the fans of the show for their support in a goodbye video (filmed in June 2010), saying \"Your love and support has meant everything to the cast and crew of \"Ghost Whisperer\" and we will all miss you guys very, very much. Go get our DVDs, think about us, miss us and know how much we all will miss you. Much love.\"\n\nIn January 2011, Hewitt told the press of her opinion about the cancellation, saying \"When you’ve taken people on a journey for so long, the least you can do is give them a goodbye. For a show that was about unfinished business, we didn’t get to finish.\"\n\nGhost Whisperer: The Other Side is a series of webisodes released on the \"Ghost Whisperer\" website. Starting in Season 2, a total of eight webisodes were produced for every season.\n\nThe first two seasons follow Zach (played by Mark Hapka), a young delivery boy who dies while delivering a package. He soon learns how to do things in the spirit world, and gets revenge on his best friend Danny, who he thinks killed him. Season 3 of the webisodes deals with a ghost named Marc (played by Justin Loyal) trying to help his high school crush Olivia (played by Jaimi Paige) find true love as her fiancé George does not love her. The fourth and final season of the webisodes deals with the ghost of a man named Bo (played by Matt Knudsen) who haunts James Tyler (played by Mark Lutz) and his family after they move into their new home.\n\nMelinda from the television series doesn't appear in the internet series as it takes place entirely in the spirit world. However, characters from the webisodes have appeared in the television series. In the second-season finale of \"Ghost Whisperer\", Zach made an appearance while trying to get help from Melinda before being taken into the Dark Side, leaving the internet series in its own cliffhanger. Zach later made another appearance and crossed over in season three episode 16 of \"Ghost Whisperer\". Marc and Olivia make brief and uncredited appearances in episode 21 of season 4 of \"Ghost Whisperer\".\n\nandshamethedevil.net is a site linked to \"Ghost Whisperer\". The site is mentioned in the Season 3 premiere. By clicking on the star in the upper right hand corner, the site appears to crack into pieces. Those pieces can be moved by dragging, revealing this message: \"Meet Me In The Underworld\". Small type at the bottom of the page read the repeated words: \"bloody mary. bloody mary. bloody mary.\" Also clicking on the word 'bloody', it leads to another site rubloodymary.com. There is a hidden message under the graphic.

A real world version of this site was created in February 2008. The site description read: \"Penthius.Info is a free search engine and video super site based on the search engine in the television series The \"Ghost Whisperer\" with Jennifer Love Hewitt.\" It was first mentioned in a post on TV.com by misscalais, a fan who created the site to promote the show.\n\nIn July 2009, Legacy Interactive announced a licensing agreement with CBS Consumer Products to develop a video game based on the \"Ghost Whisperer\" television series. The game is set to debut on the PC and Mac and include characters and themes from the show. On November 1, 2010, a developer diary was posted on the game's website, detailing areas in the game and confirming that Melinda, Jim, Delia and Eli will feature. The release date, which was initially early 2010, was changed to 2011 and the subtitle announced in the original press release, \"Shadowlands\", was dropped from the game. The game was written by Emmy award-winning television writer Lance Gentile. It was released on August 7, 2012, exclusively at Wal-Mart.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1922553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922553", "title": "Ned Breathitt", "text": "Ned Breathitt\n\nEdward Thompson Breathitt Jr. (November 26, 1924October 14, 2003) was an American politician from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. A member of one of the state's political families, he was the 51st Governor of Kentucky, serving from 1963 to 1967. After serving in World War II and graduating from the University of Kentucky, Breathitt worked on the presidential campaign of Adlai Stevenson, the senatorial campaign of Alben Barkley, and the gubernatorial campaign of Bert T. Combs. When Combs won the governorship in 1959, he appointed Breathitt as personnel commissioner, where he wrote legislation establishing the first merit system for state employees. He continued to hold appointive offices throughout Combs' tenure, and in 1962, Combs endorsed Breathitt to succeed him as governor.\n\nBreathitt defeated two-time former governor A. B. \"Happy\" Chandler in the Democratic primary, ending Chandler's political career. He went on to win the general election over Republican Louie B. Nunn. Breathitt continued Combs' work of improving state highways and parks, improving education funding, and strengthening regulations on strip mining. His major accomplishment as governor was the passage of the Kentucky Civil Rights Act, the first desegregation law passed by a southern state. His biggest disappointment was his inability to win approval of a new state constitution.\n\nFollowing his term as governor, Breathitt worked as legal counsel for Southern Railway, and later became vice-president of public affairs for Norfolk Southern Corporation. He engaged in numerous community service activities and served on political commissions aimed at eliminating poverty. Breathitt collapsed while making a speech at Lexington Community College on October 10, 2003. He was admitted to the University of Kentucky Hospital, but remained comatose after the collapse and died four days later.\n\nBreathitt's oral history project is housed at the Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History at the University of Kentucky Libraries and is also available online.\n\nNed Breathitt was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, on November 26, 1924. He was the only child of Edward Thompson Breathitt and Mary (Wallace) Breathitt. Breathitt's family had a considerable tradition in politics. A distant relative, John Breathitt had been governor of Kentucky in 1832. James Breathitt, Sr., Ned Breathitt's grandfather, had served as state attorney general from 1907 to 1911, and his uncle, James Breathitt, Jr., was lieutenant governor from 1927 to 1932.\n\nBreathitt obtained his early education in the public schools of Hopkinsville and graduated from Hopkinsville High School in 1942. Later that year, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force for service in World War II, serving until 1945. After the war, he matriculated to the University of Kentucky. While there, he served as president of the Omicron Delta Kappa honor society and the Lamp and Cross society; he was also a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon social fraternity. Seeing Breathitt's interest in politics, professors Jack Reeves and Thomas D. Clark asked him to chair the campus campaign supporting a new state constitution. Breathitt accepted, and although the proposed constitution failed, he remained committed to seeing the document updated.\n\nIn 1948, Breathitt earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration. On December 20, 1948, he married Frances Holleman of Mayfield, Kentucky. The couple had four children: Mary Fran, Linda, Susan, and Edward III. In 1950, Breathitt earned a Bachelor of Laws degree and returned to Hopkinsville where he joined the law firm of Trimble, Soyars, and Breathitt.\n\nIn 1951, Breathitt was elected to the first of three consecutive terms in the Kentucky House of Representatives, representing the Ninth District. As a legislator, he was the acknowledged leader of a faction that opposed the programs of Governor A. B. \"Happy\" Chandler. He supported the state's first legislation regulating strip mining, improved registration and election laws, and campaigned for revision of the state constitution. He also co-sponsored the Minimum Foundation Program for Education. From 1952 to 1954, Breathitt served as president of the Young Democrats Clubs of Kentucky and as a member of the national committee for the Young Democrats of America. He was chair of the state speaker's bureau for Adlai Stevenson's presidential campaign in 1952, and two years later, he worked on the staff of Senator Alben Barkley's re-election campaign.\n\nBert T. Combs put Breathitt in charge of his campaign against Wilson Wyatt in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1958. When Combs was elected governor in 1959, he appointed Breathitt as State Personnel Commissioner, charging him with writing legislation to create a merit system for state employees. After successfully guiding the legislation through the General Assembly, Breathitt resigned as personnel commissioner to accept an appointment to the Kentucky Public Service Commission. He was also served as chair of a failed state constitutional convention in 1960 and was a member of the Governor's Commission on Mental Health.\n\nIn 1962, two-time former governor and Democratic factional leader Happy Chandler had already begun his campaign for a third term as governor. The anti-Chandler faction became concerned that, if they did not name a candidate, Chandler's early announcement would give him an advantage in the 1963 election. Leaders of the faction were solidly behind state Highway Commissioner Henry Ward, but Governor Combs was leaning toward Breathitt. Breathitt announced his candidacy on May 2, 1962, but many in his party remained skeptical due to his youth and relative inexperience. Combs eventually convinced the anti-Chandler faction to back Breathitt, and Ward never became a candidate.\n\nDuring the primary campaign, Chandler focused his attacks on the Combs administration rather than the inexperienced Breathitt. A seasoned campaigner, he bitterly attacked the three percent sales tax enacted during the Combs administration. Breathitt struck back with accusations that, as a senator, Chandler had voted in favor of declaring war on Japan during World War II, but resigned his army commission shortly thereafter. He further charged that Chandler's son-in-law was collecting campaign donations from individuals who desired favors from state government. The younger Breathitt, thirty-eight years old when the campaign began, adapted well to the relatively new medium of television, while the aging Chandler did not. Breathitt won the primary by more than 60,000 votes and carried all but one of the state's congressional districts. Chandler's running mate, Harry Lee Waterfield, easily won the nomination for lieutenant governor over Breathitt's running mate, John B. Breckinridge, showing that the defeat was not so much a result of factionalism as a personal rebuff of Chandler. This campaign ended Chandler's political career.\n\nIn the general election, Breathitt challenged Republican Louie B. Nunn. Still stinging from his primary defeat, Happy Chandler endorsed Nunn, which hurt Breathitt with some members of his own party. During the campaign, Nunn attacked an executive order issued by Governor Combs that desegregated public accommodations in Kentucky as \"rule by executive decree\". Appearing on television with a copy of the executive order, Nunn proclaimed that \"my first act will be to abolish this.\" Nunn's proclamation won him the support of some conservative Democrats, but cost him Republican votes, especially in Louisville. \"The New Republic\" charged that Nunn ran \"the first outright segregationist campaign in Kentucky.\" Breathitt won the election by a margin of just over 13,000 votes.\n\nThe first legislative session of Breathitt's administration was a disappointment to his faction. His youth and narrow margin of victory in the election undermined his authority. Further, the unexpected death of Richard P. Moloney, a key legislative leader, was a blow to Breathitt's ability to push his agenda through the General Assembly. The major accomplishment of the 1964 session was the approval of a $176 million bond issue to increased funding for roads, public education, the state park system, and social services. Other minor accomplishments included passing a purchasing law, strengthening strip mining regulations, and improving benefits for teachers.\n\nMuch of the 1964 session was devoted to a bill to desegregate public accommodations in Kentucky. A rally in favor of the bill was held in March and was attended by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Reverend Ralph Abernathy, and baseball player Jackie Robinson. Despite this, the bill did not make it out of legislative committee. As a member of the Southern Governors Conference in October 1964, Breathitt was one of three governors to oppose George Wallace's proposed constitutional amendment to give states and state courts sole jurisdiction over their public schools, preventing a federal law to integrate them. Breathitt's opposition helped prevent the Conference's endorsement of the amendment, since endorsement required a unanimous vote.\n\nThe 1964 General Assembly also passed legislation to draft a new state constitution. Thirty-eight citizens were chosen to draft the new document, which was based on national models. County leaders opposed the document because of perceived threats to the independence of local governments and an apparent consolidation of power in Frankfort. Despite Breathitt's strong support, the proposed constitution was defeated by Kentucky voters by an overwhelming margin of 510,099 to 140,210.\n\nBreathitt expanded the state park system and led the state to join the Tennessee Valley Authority in developing the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area. In 1965, the Midwest Travel Writer's Association presented Breathitt with its top national award for having the best travel promotion. That same year, he was named to the University of Kentucky Alumni Association Hall of Distinguished Alumni.\n\nA June 1965 ruling by the Kentucky Court of Appeals that property must be assessed at its full value prompted calls for a special session from Kentucky taxpayers. Breathitt obliged, calling the session in July. He proposed a reduction in property tax rates to offset the increase in the assessed value of property, and also advocated small increased in other tax rates to benefit public schools. The plan passed despite opposition from Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield.\n\nThe 1966 legislative session was much more successful for Breathitt. His economic development program, which led to construction or expansion of 749 industries, 57,000 new jobs, and more than $1 billion in new plant investment, was recognized as the nation's best by the Society of Industrial Investors in 1964 and generated an additional $100 million in state revenue. The pro-administration majority in the legislature was expanded in the 1965 elections, and Waterfield, Breathitt's sometimes hostile lieutenant governor, was stripped of much of his authority. Former governor Lawrence Wetherby was selected president pro tempore of the senate, providing effective leadership in that house of the General Assembly. Wetherby introduced a budget which was 27 percent larger than the previous one and contained appropriations for most of the state's political districts. Wetherby's leadership was so effective that the budget passed both houses of the Assembly, virtually unchanged, by votes of 99–0 and 31–5 only ten days later.\n\nPassage of the national Civil Rights Act of 1964 had paved the way for an even stronger civil rights bill in the 1966 legislative session. The Assembly easily passed the Kentucky Civil Rights Act opening all public accommodations to people of every race and prohibiting racial discrimination in employment by firms that employed eight or more people. The act applied to many kinds of businesses not covered by the federal statute, and approximately ninety percent of the businesses in Kentucky were affected, compared to only sixty percent that were covered by the federal statute. The act was the first of its kind passed in a southern state. In 1966, Breathitt was presented with the Lincoln Key Award for his leadership in the bill's passage. In 1966 and 1967, he was chair of the Southern Governors' Conference's Committee on Regional and Interstate Cooperation. He was also the only state governor named to the President's Council on Human Rights.\n\nBreathitt was a member of National Governors Conference Executive Committee in 1964 and 1965 and chaired its Natural Resources Committee. In the 1966 legislature, he won approval for several conservation measures, including the creation of an authority to regulate water, soil, and forest resources. The session also tightened strip mining laws to prohibit mining on mountainsides that were too steep to be restored. In 1967, he was recognized with the U.S. Department of Interior's Distinguished Service Award and Outdoor Life magazine's Conservationist of the Year Award for his contributions to conservation.\n\nOther accomplishments of the 1966 legislature included the passage of a compulsory vehicle inspection law, tightening of restrictions on political contributions and expenditures by candidates for political office, and approval of a legislative redistricting law. The governor's road construction projects continued apace, and by the end of his term, Kentucky had more miles of highway under construction than any other state.\n\nDuring his term as governor, Breathitt was chair of the Board of Trustees at the University of Kentucky. Under his leadership, the state's community colleges were placed under the governance of the university. Four state colleges achieved university status during Breathitt's administration. He also established the Kentucky Educational Television network and Kentucky's vocational education system.\n\nBreathitt was limited to one term by Kentucky's constitution at the time. He returned to his legal practice in Hopkinsville, and in December 1967, became Special Counsel in Kentucky for Southern Railway. In July 1968, he was named director of the Ford Foundation's Institute for Rural America, suggesting legislative remedies for poverty including the establishment of state area development districts. In 1971, he helped found the Coalition for Rural America and was elected its chair. The Coalition worked to implement the suggestions of the Institute for Rural America. Breathitt also served as president of the American Child Centers to promote private preschool education and was appointed as the federal representative on the Southern Interstate Nuclear Board in September 1968. When Southern Railway became part of Norfolk Southern Corporation in 1972, Breathitt became vice-president for public affairs, a position he held until his retirement in 1992.\n\nBreathitt was an important adviser to Governor John Y. Brown, Jr., who appointed him to the University of Kentucky's Board of Trustees in 1981 and 1982. Breathitt's wife Frances died of complications from cancer on July 11, 1985. On April 2, 1988, he married Lucy Alexander Winchester, a former social secretary to First Lady Pat Nixon and cousin to Libby Jones, wife of future Kentucky governor Brereton Jones.\n\nBreathitt later served on the boards of regents of Kentucky State University and Morehead State University, in both cases serving with former political rival Louie B. Nunn. From 1992 to 2000, he again served on the University of Kentucky's board, acting as chairman of the board in all but his final year. During his chairmanship, he clashed with Governor Paul E. Patton over a plan to separate all of the state's community colleges (except Lexington Community College) from the university's governance and place them under a newly created body called the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. Patton's plan prevailed, and he and Breathitt later mended political fences.\n\nIn 1992, Breathitt joined the law firm of Wyatt, Tarrant, and Combs. He undertook several volunteer community service activities, including serving as director of Home Loan Bank in Cincinnati and chairman of the Kentucky Heart Fund. He was appointed to the Southern Region Education Board and the Kentucky Council on Higher Education. In 1994, he was named to the Gatton College of Business Alumni Hall of Fame at the University of Kentucky; in 1997, he received a similar honor from the College of Law at the university. He also received an honorary doctorate from Murray State University in 1994. In 1999, he received the Henry Clay Medallion for Distinguished Service and in 2000, Eastern Kentucky University's Center for Kentucky History and Politics presented him with the John Sherman Cooper Award for Outstanding Public Service to Kentucky. He retired from the practice of law in 2002.\n\nWhile giving a speech at Lexington Community College on October 10, 2003, Breathitt collapsed due to ventricular fibrillation. He was resuscitated and admitted to the University of Kentucky Hospital but remained comatose and died on October 14. He was buried at the Riverside Cemetery in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. In 2000, the Pennyrile Parkway in western Kentucky was renamed the Edward T. Breathitt Pennyrile Parkway in his honor.\n\n\n"}

It was originally recorded by the Temptations in 1971. Producer Norman Whitfield had the song re-recorded by the Undisputed Truth the same year, resulting in a number-three \"Billboard\" Hot 100 position for the group. \"Smiling Faces\" was the only Top 40 single released by the Undisputed Truth, and was included on their debut album \"The Undisputed Truth\".\n\nBoth versions of \"Smiling Faces Sometimes\" deal with the same subject matter, \"back-stabbing\" friends who do their friends wrong behind their backs (\"Smiling faces sometimes...they don't tell the truth...smiling faces sometimes tell lies\"), but in different ways. The Temptations' original uses an arrangement similar to a haunted house film score to represent feelings of fear and timidness. Included on the 1971 \"Sky's the Limit\" album, \"Smiling Faces Sometimes\" runs over 12 minutes, most of which is extended instrumental passages without any vocals. An edited version was planned as the Temptations' summer 1971 single release, but this plan was dropped when lead vocalist Eddie Kendricks, frustrated by personnel problems within the group, quit the Temptations and signed a solo deal with Motown in March 1971.\n\nWhitfield was known for recording dramatically different versions of the same song with different Motown artists, including Smokey Robinson & the Miracles' \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" (re-recorded as hit records for Gladys Knight & the Pips, and Marvin Gaye) and the Temptations' \"War\" (re-recorded as a hit for Edwin Starr). After Kendricks left The Temptations, an undaunted Whitfield re-recorded the song with his latest protégés, psychedelic trio the Undisputed Truth. \"Billboard\" ranked the resulting single as the #14 song for 1971. It has since been covered by Bobbi Humphrey, Joan Osborne, Rare Earth, and others.\n\nFuture Undisputed Truth singles would never make it higher than #63, a position attained by both 1972's \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\" and 1974's \"Help Yourself\". \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\" was re-recorded by The Temptations shortly after its release, and this re-recorded version became not only a #1 pop hit, but a three-time Grammy Award winner as well.\n\nThe O'Jays' similarly themed 1972 hit \"Back Stabbers\" quotes the lyrics \"smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes...(tell lies)\" in the refrain near the end of the song.\n\nWhitfield later revisited the song for the 1973 album \"Ma\", recorded by Motown's white rock band, Rare Earth, which he produced and wrote.\n\nVirginia \"Vee\" McDonald, who was the female lead singer in the second incarnation of The Undisputed Truth (after Brenda Evans and Billie Calvin left in 1973), recorded a solo version of the song in 1990 for Ian Levine and his Motorcity Records project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This was a different storm from the historic event that struck the Midwest and southern Canada around December 23 from another cyclone which preceded this storm. The event involved a thin band of snowfall with unusually cold temperatures for the middle Texas coast, and caused dozens of varied weather records to be shattered. It was the most significant snow for the Texas Gulf Coast, and deep South Texas, since February 1895.\n\nThere had been indications for up to a week before the event that a frontal wave in the Gulf of Mexico was expected to track far enough to the south (along roughly the 26th parallel) to lead to snow along the Gulf of Mexico coastline of the United States.\n\nA surface cyclone formed in the western Gulf of Mexico on December 24 and December 28 due to a shortwave aloft, and moved eastward through the western Gulf of Mexico, bringing banded snowfall to the middle Texas coast. The extratropical cyclone moved east, then northeast, tracking across the northern peninsula of Florida early on December 26 before moving about 100 miles (200 km) offshore the Southeast, paralleling the coast. Continuing to deepen, the developing storm moved about 200 miles (300 km) offshore the Mid-Atlantic states, New England, and Atlantic Canada on December 27 before moving out to sea.\n\nThe most noticeable, and unusual, event associated with the storm was the snowfall it produced. Much of the snow fell in southern Texas, along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, but some snow, albeit less deep, fell across southwestern and southeastern Louisiana. Any snowfall in these areas is extremely unusual, perhaps occurring once every twenty years, and these events are usually airborne flurries which melt on contact with the ground. In many places the snow stuck to the ground and accumulated to an appreciable depth. In Brownsville, Texas, snow fell to a depth of , the first measurable snowfall at the city in years, since the Great Blizzard of 1899.\nThe fact that the snow accumulated overnight on Christmas Eve led to a White Christmas the next morning, something completely foreign to the region. Across all of southern Texas and in southwestern Louisiana, snow fell in places where it had not for anywhere from 15 to 120 years. Near the coast, in Corpus Christi, Texas, of snow fell, more snow than in all previous recorded years combined. This was also the case in Victoria, Texas, where a significant fell. New Orleans, Louisiana had its first white Christmas in 50 years. In addition to the unusual occurrence of snow inland, moderate to heavy snow was also reported over the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico. This is the first significant snow fall in Houston since February 12, 1960, when a snowstorm hit central and south Texas with eight to 10 inches of snow.\nSome snow totals:\n\n\nAs the cyclone tracked through Florida offshore the Southeast, up to an inch of freezing rain and sleet fell at Augusta and Aiken.\n\nSeveral inches of snow fell across portions of the state, with the highest amount noted of at Ahoskie.\n\nSeveral locations across the Tidewater reported over a foot of snow, with the highest amount of reported at Quinby and Tabb. Frontogenesis (strengthening temperature gradient) within the comma head of the extratropical cyclone between the 500 hPa and 700 hPa layers (or 10-20 kft) contributed to the banded snow seen across this region. It led to the snowiest December across the Norfolk area since 1958.\n\nLight to moderate snow fell on the Eastern Shore, with the highest amount of measured at Shelltown.\n\nOn December 25, 2004, there was light to moderate snows fall across portions of the state, with the highest amount of falling at Mount Holly.\n\nSoutheastern sections of the state saw the snowfall. The highest amount reported was at East Hampton.\n\nModerate to heavy snow fell across much of the state. The highest total reported was at East Killingly.\n\nHeavy snow fell statewide. The highest total was at Tiverton.\n\nThe heaviest snowfall from the storm fell across Massachusetts. Brewster measured during the event.\n\nCentral and southern sections of the state saw moderate to heavy snow. The highest amount was at Salem.\n\nSnow fell across portions of the state during this storm, with falling at a dairy farm in Franklin.\n\nHeavy snow fell across portions of Maine.

Beckham\n\nJohn Crepps Wickliffe Beckham (August 5, 1869 – January 9, 1940) was the 35th Governor of Kentucky and a United States Senator from Kentucky. He was the state's first popularly-elected senator after the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment.\n\nDescended from a prominent political family, Beckham was chosen as Democrat William Goebel's running mate in the gubernatorial election of 1899 despite the fact that he had turned 30, the minimum age for governor, during the campaign. Goebel lost the election to Republican William S. Taylor, but the Kentucky General Assembly disputed the election results. During the political wrangling that followed, an unknown assassin shot Goebel. A day later the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give the election to Goebel, who was sworn into office on his deathbed. Taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the Democratic majority in the General Assembly, and a legal fight occurred between him and Beckham over the governorship. Beckham ultimately prevailed and Taylor fled the state. Beckham later won a special election to fill the remainder of Goebel's term, since less than half the term had expired, and an election in his own right in 1903.\n\nDuring his second term as governor, in 1906, Beckham made a bid to become a US senator. His stance in favor of prohibition cost him the votes of four legislators in his own party, and the General Assembly gave the seat to Republican William O. Bradley, who had been governor from 1895 to 1899. Six years later, Beckham secured the seat by popular election, but he lost his re-election bid in 1920, largely because of his pro-temperance views and his opposition to women's suffrage.\n\nThough he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades, he never returned to elected office, failing both in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 (with suspected electoral fraud) and his senatorial campaign in 1936. He died in Louisville on January 9, 1940.\n\nBeckham County, Oklahoma, is named for him.\n\nHe was born at Wickland, near Bardstown in Nelson County, Kentucky, son of William Netherton and Julia Tevis (Wickliffe) Beckham. His maternal grandfather, Charles A. Wickliffe, was governor of Kentucky from 1839 to 1840 and served as postmaster general in the administration of John Tyler. His uncle, Robert C. Wickliffe, served as governor of Louisiana.\n\nBeckham obtained his early education at Roseland Academy in Bardstown. In 1881, he served as a page in the Kentucky House of Representatives at 12. Later, he enrolled at Central University (now Eastern Kentucky University) in Richmond, Kentucky but was forced to quit school at 17 to support his widowed mother. Two years later, he became principal of Bardstown public schools, from 1888 to 1893.\n\nConcurrently, he studied law at the University of Kentucky, where he earned his law degree in 1889. He was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Bardstown in 1893. He also served as president of the Young Democrats' Club of Nelson County.\n\nBeckham's political career began in 1894, when he was elected without opposition to the Kentucky House of Representatives. He served four consecutive terms and was its Speaker in 1898, his final year in the House. He also served as a delegate to every Democratic National Convention from 1900 to 1920.\n\nDemocrat William Goebel chose Beckham as his running mate in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899. Goebel was hesitant about the selection because he wanted someone who could deliver the vote of his home county in the general election, and Beckham's native Nelson County was already committed to a rival candidate. However, friends of Goebel assured him that Beckham would be loyal to Goebel's reform agenda, but the two other men Goebel was considering as running mates would \"stack the Senate committees against him.\" Beckham was not yet 30, the minimum age to serve as governor, at the time of his selection.\n\nGoebel lost a close election to Republican William S. Taylor. When the General Assembly's session opened on January 2, 1900, the election results were immediately challenged. With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly, the results seemed sure to be reversed. The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30, 1900, when Goebel was shot by an unknown assailant as he entered the state capitol building. The following day, as Goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give him the election. Beckham was sworn into office from his bed the same day. Three days later, Goebel died, never having risen from the bed.\n\nLegislative chaos ensued, as Taylor refused to acknowledge the Assembly's decision and vacate the governorship. The Republicans in the legislature obeyed Taylor's orders, but the Democrats ignored Taylor and followed the orders of their leadership. Finally, on February 21, 1900, Taylor and Beckham agreed to let the courts settle the matter. The case first went before the Louisville Circuit Court, which found in favor of Beckham. Republicans appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then the court of last resort in the state. On April 6, 1900, the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court. Taylor appealed to the US Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case on May 21, 1900. Taylor's only supporter on the court was John Marshall Harlan, from Kentucky.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruling, Taylor fled to Indianapolis, Indiana, fearing he would be implicated in Goebel's assassination. Beckham became acting governor, but because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the election, a special election was held on November 6, 1900 to determine who would complete Goebel's unexpired term. Beckham, now of age, won the election over Republican John W. Yerkes by fewer than 4,000 votes. Shortly afterward, Beckham married Jean Raphael Fuqua, of Owensboro. The couple had two sons.\n\nAs governor, Beckham sought to unite his party and the state by supporting changes to the blatantly-partisan Goebel Election Law, which had been authored by his late running mate while the latter was a member of the General Assembly. He stressed non-controversial issues, such as improvements to roads and the state's educational system. He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform that both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign. However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major pieces of legislation passed during Beckham's term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under fourteen to work without their parents' consent.\n\nAlthough the Kentucky Constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms, Beckham announced that he would seek a full term as governor in 1903. His candidacy was challenged in court, but the court ruled Beckham had not served a full first term and so was eligible to run. His record of reconciliation and of supporting non-controversial reforms prevented significant opposition when he won the party's nomination. His record also deprived his Republican opponent, Morris B. Belknap, of any significant campaign issue in the general election. Beckham defeated Belknap and three minor candidates.\nIn his message to the legislature in 1904, Beckham again raised the issue of a uniform school textbook law, which had not passed during his first term. The law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the 1904 session. Also during the session, funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late Governor Goebel.\n\nIn March 1904, Beckham signed the Day Law, mandating racial segregation of all schools in Kentucky. Berea College, a private college in eastern Kentucky that had been integrated since the 1850s, immediately filed suit to challenge the law. Its substance was upheld in the circuit court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Berea appealed to the Supreme Court, which, in 1908, which decided, in \"Berea College v. Kentucky\", against the college. Again, only Harlan dissented.\n\nNear the close of the 1904 session, legislators approved the creation of Beckham County from parts of Carter, Elliott, and Lewis Counties. Olive Hill was made the county seat. Soon, the county's existence was challenged in court on grounds that it fell short of the required by the state constitution and that it reduced the counties from which it was carved to less than . Carter County joined the lawsuit, claiming the border of Beckham County passed too close to Grayson, the seat of Carter County, and to Vanceburg, the seat of Lewis County. The state constitution forbade county borders from passing within of a county seat. On April 29, 1904, the Kentucky Court of Appeals found in favor of the plaintiffs and dissolved Beckham County.\n\nDuring the 1906 legislative session, Beckham urged investigation and prosecution of corrupt insurance companies by following the lead of New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes. In particular, he recommended reducing the practice of deferred dividends, which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on hand for illegal purposes. He further advocated for insurance companies doing business in the state to be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky to bolstering the state's economy and to provide policyholders some protection against fraud.\n\nBeckham refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars. He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal, but more probably, his reasons were political. The Democrats were dominant in the region, and he wanted to avoid challenging his own party.\n\nBy collecting some old US Civil War debts from the federal government, Beckham also virtually eliminated the state's debt. Encouraged by the state's improved finances, the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state's normal schools: Western State Teachers College in Bowling Green (later Western Kentucky University) and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond (later part of Eastern Kentucky University).\n\nWith a successful legislative session behind him, Beckham made a bold political move in June 1906. He orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and senatorial primaries in November, a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. Beckham wanted the Senate seat, and if the primary was moved up two years, he could secure his party's nomination while he was still governor. He could also use his influence as governor to sway the party's choice of his potential successor as governor. State Auditor Samuel Wilbur Hager was Beckham's choice for governor and easily won the early primary over challenger N.B. Hays. Former Governor James B. McCreary challenged Beckham for the senatorial nomination, but Beckham won by more than 11,000 votes.\n\nBeckham's term as governor ended on December 10, 1907. In January 1908, he faced the legislature as the Democratic nominee for a seat in the US Senate by virtue of the primary that had been held two years earlier. The Republicans nominated former Governor William O. Bradley. On the first ballot, Beckham secured 66 of the needed 69 votes; Bradley received 64 votes. Seven Democrats had not voted for Beckham. Over the next six weeks, 25 more votes were taken, with neither man securing a majority, even though William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic nominee for president, campaigned for Beckham. Some Democrats pressured Beckham to withdraw and to allow a more palatable Democrat to run, but he refused. On the 29th ballot, taken near the end of February 1908, Bradley finally secured a majority, after four Democrats crossed party lines to vote for him.\n\nBeckham's ardent support of Prohibition likely cost him the election. That put him at odds with Henry Watterson, editor of the powerful \"Louisville Courier-Journal\". As governor Beckham had crossed the liquor interests and the political machine in Louisville. When the Kentucky Court of Appeals invalidated the results of Louisville's municipal elections for interference by the city's \"whiskey ring\" in May 1907, Beckham appointed Robert Worth Bingham, a young lawyer and fellow prohibitionist, as the interim mayor until elections could be held in November. Bingham eliminated grafting in the police department, closed gambling houses, and enforced blue laws that closed saloons on Sunday. The whiskey ring, therefore, announced that Beckham had forfeited the support of Louisville's legislators. In the senatorial election in 1908, three of the four Democrats who voted against Beckham were from Louisville. Following his defeat, Beckham returned to his law practice.\n\nSix years later, Beckham again attempted to win back hia Senate seat. The passage of the Seventeenth Amendment meant that the Senate would no longer be elected by the legislature but instead by popular vote.\n\nIn the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated Augustus O. Stanley, a 12-year veteran of the House of Representatives. The Republican nominee was former Governor Augustus E. Willson. Bolstered by his support of President Woodrow Wilson, Beckham won the election by 32,000 votes.\n\nBeckham served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the US Department of Labor from 1915 to 1917 and on the Senate Committee on Military Affairs. In the latter position, he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky: Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox. Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I, Fort Knox became the home of the US Bullion Depository.\n\nAfter the United States entered World War I, Beckham continued to back Wilson and later supported the League of Nations.\n\nTrue to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham supported passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, which enacted Prohibition in the United States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920. Believing that women should be protected from involvement in politics, Beckham opposed the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women's suffrage. The amendment failed on February 10, 1919 but passed on June 4, 1919. Beckham voted against it both times.\n\nThe Democrats renominated Beckham without opposition in 1920. His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst. Prohibition had destroyed the distilling industry and the saloon business in the state, and in areas that those industries were prominent, Beckham received more than 5,000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M. Cox. He was also hurt by the women's vote and by his support of Wilson, who had lost popularity since Beckham's election, in 1914. Ernst won the election by fewer than 5,000 votes, winning the race with 50.3% of the vote to Beckham's 49.7&%.\n\nDuring his only term in the Senate, Beckham served alongside three other US Senators from Kentucky: Ollie M. James, George B. Martin, and Augustus O. Stanley.\n\nAfter his term in the Senate ended, Beckham resumed his legal practice in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in 1927. This time, he had the support of the \"Louisville Courier-Journal\", which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. Bingham. He was opposed by a powerful political machine, known as the Jockey Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state's horse racetracks.\n\nThe Jockey Club ran a candidate in both parties' primary elections. In the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated the Club's relatively-obscure candidate, Robert T. Crowe. Flem D. Sampson, the Club's nominee in the Republican primary, won his party's nomination. In the general election, Beckham could not secure the support of Democratic Governor William J. Fields, who had been elected with the help of the Jockey Club. Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot, including the race for lieutenant governor, Beckham lost to Sampson by more than 32,000 votes, with voting fraud suspected but never proved. It was estimated that the Club spent over $500,000 to defeat him.\n\nBeckham was expected to be the Democrats' nominee for governor in 1935, but the death of his son in late 1934 had left him distraught, and his wife was opposed to another campaign. The Democrats turned to A. B. \"Happy\" Chandler, of Henderson, who won the election. Beckham supported Chandler's bid, and in return, Chandler appointed him to the Kentucky Public Service Commission in 1936. Beckham also served on the Department of Business Regulations Commission and chaired the State Government Reorganization Commission.\nBeckham attempted to return to the Senate in 1936. The head of the Jockey Club, James B. Brown, had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in 1930.\n\nIn 1933, Beckham's ally, Bingham, had been appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James's, in London, increasing his prominence and his influence. Beckham also enjoyed the support of the United Mine Workers and Louisville Mayor Neville Miller. The race was complicated, however, by the entry of John Y. Brown, a U.S. Democratic Representative and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives. He had agreed to support Chandler's bid for the governorship in exchange for Chandler's support in his run for the Senate. However, Chandler threw his support to Beckham, and while Brown was not able to win the seat without the support of Bingham and Chandler, he won 85,000 votes, most of them at Beckham's expense. Democratic incumbent M. M. Logan retained the seat by 2,385 votes.\n\nBeckham died in Louisville on January 9, 1940, and was buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky. Beckham County, Oklahoma, was named in his honor at the suggestion of a Kentuckian who was serving as a delegate to Oklahoma's constitutional convention in 1907. Wickland, his birthplace, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 16, 1973.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was created in 1396 when the Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst was partitioned between Anhalt-Dessau and Anhalt-Köthen. The first creation lasted until 1562, when it fell to Prince Joachim Ernest of Anhalt-Zerbst, who merged it into the reunited Principality of Anhalt.\n\nAnhalt-Köthen was created a second time in 1603, when Anhalt was again divided. In 1806, Anhalt-Köthen was raised to a duchy. With the death of Duke Henry on 23 November 1847, the Anhalt-Köthen line became extinct and its territories were united to Anhalt-Dessau by patent of 22 May 1853. Today, Anhalt-Köthen is mostly remembered as a long-time residence of Johann Sebastian Bach, while he worked for Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen.\n\nThe Principality of Anhalt arose in 1212 under its first ruler, Henry I, son of the Saxon duke Bernhard III. Named after Anhalt Castle, the ancestral seat of the Ascanian dynasty near Harzgerode, the principality experienced a number of partitions throughout its centuries-long existence. When Henry died in 1252, his sons divided their heritage, with the younger, Prince Siegfried I receiving the Anhalt-Zerbst territory including Dessau and Köthen.\n\nThe Principality of Anhalt-Köthen emerged in 1396, when the two surviving sons of late Prince John II of Anhalt-Zerbst divided their heritage and the younger, Prince Albert IV, took his residence at Köthen. Upon the death of his elder brother Prince Sigismund I of Anhalt-Dessau in 1405, Albert also acted as a regent for Sigismund's minor sons. He himself died in 1423 and was succeeded by his sons Adolph I and Waldemar V. Waldemar died in 1436 and Adolph entered a long-time quarrel with their cousin Prince George I of Anhalt-Dessau, finally in 1471, both concluded a succession contract whereby George took over the government of half the principality and became co-ruler as \"Lord of Köthen\".\n\nWhen Adolph's younger brother, Prince Albert VI, succeeded in 1473, he had to share the rule over Anhalt-Köthen with George's sons, Prince Waldemar VI and George II. While George II soon after entered the service of Elector Albrecht Achilles of Brandenburg, Waldemar was able to regain the pawned territory of Hoym and also added Burgscheidungen to his possessions. Albert VI died in 1475 and was succeeded by his only son Philip, with his cousins Magnus and Adolph II, the sons of Adolph I, as co-rulers. Philip died in 1500 and his cousins formally abdicated in 1508 in favour of Waldemar's son and heir Wolfgang, then sole ruler of Anhalt-Köthen.\n\nPrince Wolfgang met with Martin Luther at the 1521 Diet of Augsburg and implemented the Protestant Reformation in his territories; the second Prince of the Holy Roman Empire to do so after the Saxon elector Frederick the Wise. He also became a leading member of the Protestant League of Torgau and the Schmalkaldic League against the policies of the Habsburg emperor Charles V. Temporarily banned, his possessions were restored in the 1552 Peace of Passau. Without heirs, Wolfgang in 1562 ceded Anhalt-Köthen to his cousins Joachim Ernest and Bernhard VII of Anhalt-Zerbst. Upon Bernhard's death in 1570, all Anhalt territories were formally re-united under Joachim Ernest's rule.\n\nPrince Joachim Ernest died in 1586, and his sons first ruled jointly. In 1603, however, the five surviving brothers again divided their heritage, with Anhalt-Köthen recreated for Prince Louis I. The partition was consummated until 1606, while the Louis' eldest brother Prince John George I of Anhalt-Dessau formally remained the head of all Anhalt principalities. Louis turned out to be a capable ruler; in 1617 he founded the literary Fruitbearing Society and became its first president, he worked with Wolfgang Ratke to implement educational reforms and had Schloss Köthen rebuilt. When he died in 1650, his son and successor William Louis was still a minor with Prince Augustus of Anhalt-Plötzkau and, from 1653, his sons Leberecht and Emmanuel acting as regents.\n\nAs William Louis' marriage with Elizabeth Charlotte had remained childless, he was succeeded by Leberecht and Emmanuel upon his death in 1665. From 1671 Emmanuel's son Emmanuel Lebrecht became sole rule of Anhalt-Köthen, initially under the guardianship of his mother Princess Anna Eleonore and Prince John George II of Anhalt-Dessau. He took over the government in 1692 and entered into a morganatic marriage with Gisela Agnes of Rath, elevated to a \"Reichsgräfin\" of Nienburg by Emperor Leopold I in 1694.\n\nWhen Emmanuel Lebrecht died in 1704, he was succeeded by his second-born but eldest surviving son Leopold. Also a minor at his father's death, his mother Gisela Agnes acted as regent, supervised by King Frederick I of Prussia. Leopold came of age in 1715; he was a great patron of the arts, founded the Köthen court orchestra and, in 1717, employed Johann Sebastian Bach as \"Kapellmeister\". Bach stayed in Köthen until 1723, where he worked with violinist Christian Ferdinand Abel and met with singer Anna Magdalena Wilcke, who became his second wife in 1721. Prince Leopold died in 1728 at the age of 33; as he left no sons, his principality fell to his brother Augustus Louis.\n\nUpon his death in 1755, Prince Augustus Louis was succeeded by his second-born son Karl George Leberecht. During the Seven Years' War, Karl George tried to ease the impact on his principality; in 1751 he joined the Prussian Army and became a general in the Habsburg Imperial Army in 1789; soon after he was killed in the Siege of Belgrade. He was succeeded by his son Augustus Christian, who received parts of the extinct Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst in 1793 and was elevated to a duke (\"Herzog\") by Napoleon in 1806. Anhalt-Köthen became a member of the German Confederation of the Rhine in 1807. Prince Augustus Christian died in 1812, and the ducal title passed to his minor nephew Louis Augustus Karl Frederick Emil, son of Prince Louis, himself the younger brother of Prince Augustus Louis. Duke Leopold III of Anhalt-Dessau acted as regent, however, Louis Augustus died in 1818 at the age of 16, leaving no heirs.\n\nIn 1765, Frederick Erdmann, the youngest son of Prince Augustus Louis, had received the Silesian state country in the former Duchy of Pless from the hands of his maternal uncle, Count John Erdmann of Promnitz. From that time on, he styled himself as \"Prince of Anhalt-Köthen-Pless\".\n\nHis son, Frederick Ferdinand, inherited the princely title in 1797. Upon the early death in 1818 of Louis Augustus, Duke of Anhalt-Köthen, Frederick Ferdinand inherited the ducal title of Anhalt-Köthen. He then ceded Pless to his younger brother, Henry.\n\nUpon Frederick Ferdinand's death in 1830, Henry succeeded him as Duke of Anhalt-Köthen. He left Pless to the youngest brother, Louis, who predeceased him in 1841. With Henry's death in 1847, the Anhalt-Köthen line became extinct, and all territories passed to Duke Leopold IV of Anhalt-Dessau.\n\n\"To Prince Joachim Ernest of Anhalt-Zerbst\".\n\n\"Raised to Duchy 1806\".\n\n\"To Duke Leopold IV of Anhalt-Dessau\"\n\n"}

On January 8, 2003, Flight 5481 was operated by a Beechcraft 1900D (registration number \"\"). The aircraft was originally delivered new to Air Midwest in 1996, and had accumulated 15,003 flight hours at the time of the crash.\n\nThere were two crew members and 19 passengers aboard the Beechcraft. The two crew members and 12 passengers were American; the rest were from different nationalities. The crew consisted of captain Katie Leslie (age 25) and first officer Jonathan Gibbs (age 27). Leslie was the youngest captain flying for the airline at that time, and had accrued 1,865 hours total company flying time, including 1,100 hours as the pilot-in-command of a Beechcraft 1900D.

Both pilots were based in Charlotte.\n\nOn the morning of January 8, 2003, ramp agents loaded 23 checked bags onto Flight 5481, including two unusually heavy bags. The flight crew completed their pre-flight checklists, including weight and balance checks.\n\nFlight 5481 left the gate at about 08:30 Eastern Standard Time. At 08:37, ground controllers cleared Flight 5481 to taxi to runway 18R for departure. At 08:46, the tower controller cleared Flight 5481 for takeoff, and the pilots applied takeoff power and began their takeoff roll.\n\nImmediately after becoming airborne, Flight 5481's nose began to rapidly pitch up. By the time it reached an altitude of 90 feet above ground level (AGL), the plane's nose had pitched up 20 degrees. Despite both pilots trying forcefully to push the nose down, the plane continued to pitch nose-up, reaching a maximum of 54 degrees of pitch. The aircraft's stall warning horn sounded, and the pilots declared an emergency to air traffic controllers. After climbing to an altitude of 1,150 feet AGL, the plane stalled, abruptly pitching down into an uncontrollable descent. Approximately 35 seconds after taking off, Flight 5481 crashed into an aircraft maintenance hangar and burst into flames.\n\nThe nineteen passengers and both pilots were killed. A US Airways mechanic on the ground was treated for smoke inhalation. No one else on the ground was hurt.\n\nThe investigators determined the crash to have been the result of the combination of two separate issues. After take-off, the plane climbed steeply as a result of higher than calculated weight on the aircraft. Even though both pilots pushed forward on the control column, the plane did not respond to their input, and this led to the stalling of the aircraft.\n\nThe aircraft's most recent service involved adjusting the elevator control cable, and was performed two nights before the crash at a repair facility located at Tri-State Airport in Huntington, West Virginia. During the investigation, it emerged that the mechanic who worked on the elevator cables had never worked on this type of aircraft. Investigation revealed that turnbuckles controlling tension on the cables to the elevators had been set incorrectly, resulting in insufficient elevator travel, leading to the pilots not having sufficient pitch control. Although normally a post-adjustment control test would be conducted to ensure that the maintenance had been carried out correctly, and that the surface was operating properly, the maintenance supervisor who was instructing the mechanic decided to skip this step. The NTSB noted that the FAA was aware of \"serious deficiencies\" in the training procedures at the facility, but had done nothing to correct them.\n\nAlthough the pilots had totaled up the take-off weight of the aircraft before the flight and determined it to be within limits, the plane was actually overloaded and out of balance due to the use of incorrect Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved passenger weight estimates. When checked, the National Transportation Safety Board found that the actual weight of an average passenger was more than 20 pounds (9 kg) greater than estimated. After checking the actual weight of baggage retrieved from the crash site and passengers (based on information from next-of-kin and the medical examiner), it was found that the aircraft was actually 580 pounds (264 kg) above its maximum allowable take-off weight with its center of gravity 5% to the rear of the allowable limit.\n\nIt was determined that neither problem alone would have caused the loss of control, which explains why it had previously been flown without incident and had safely departed Huntington, West Virginia.\n\nThe NTSB report included 21 safety recommendations.\n\nAs a result of the weight issues discovered, the FAA planned to investigate and potentially revise estimated weight values, something that had not been done since 1936. Air Midwest used an average weight of 200 pounds (90.7 kg) per passenger after the accident, but the NTSB suggests that airlines use actual weights instead of average. 70% of small air carriers still use average. Air Midwest publicly apologized for the incident after the family of crash victim Christiana Grace Shepherd pressured the airline to do so. Air Midwest ceased operations in 2008.\n\nThere is a memorial outside of Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\nThe crash was featured in Season 5 of the Canadian made, internationally distributed documentary series \"Mayday\", in an episode titled \"Dead Weight\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1922655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922655", "title": "De Facto (band)", "text": "De Facto (band)\n\nDe Facto was a dub reggae band which included Cedric Bixler-Zavala, Omar Rodríguez-López, Isaiah \"Ikey\" Owens and Jeremy Michael Ward.\n\nThe band began as small jam sessions after At the Drive-In shows. The original band consisted of Omar, Cedric, and Jeremy playing local shows around their home town, El Paso, Texas. Cedric said, \"Yeah actually we used to be called the Sphinktators, that was early De Facto, just more rock.\" Omar was actually the singer of the Sphinktators and remembers, \"We used psychedelic sounds, Cedric played the bass, Jeremy played guitar, and Ralph Jasso played drums.\"\n\nFor their first recording they brainstormed the name De Facto Cadre Dub, which was later shortened to De Facto. The lineup of the band was switched around: Cedric played drums like he did before in his earlier bands Foss and Los Dregtones, Omar played bass, and Jeremy ran samples, sang and did the sparse guitar work. Ralph Jasso moved to keyboards but soon quit the band. The self-titled recording was released as a very limited vinyl pressing in 1999; it would be re-released in 2001 as \"How Do You Dub? You Fight for Dub. You Plug Dub In.\" through Headquarter Records, now known as Restart Records. Omar met Ikey Owens at a hip hop show. They exchanged numbers and then Ikey met up with them during one of their shows and joined De Facto as their keyboard player midshow. After relocating to the west coast, Ikey joined the band full-time.\n\nFollowing the break-up of At the Drive-in in 2001 Omar and Cedric switched their focus on De Facto. That year eventually saw all the band's releases come out, starting with \"456132015\" EP produced by Mario Caldato Jr. De Facto's first full-length album, \"¡Megaton Shotblast!\" was released on the Gold Standard Laboratories label, and received moderate success, probably in part due to the popularity of At the Drive-In. \"Légende du Scorpion à Quatre Queues\", which would be the last De Facto album, followed the same year, released through Modern City Records. Both albums combined band's studio recordings made in 2000 with live recordings from the European tour in 2001.\n\nIn 2001, the members of the band teamed up with bassist Eva Gardner and drummer Blake Fleming to form The Mars Volta. Despite this, De Facto continued to play numerous live shows in the following years. During that time, Omar met John Frusciante at one of the shows and the two became friends; Frusciante once joined De Facto on stage as a guest guitarist. The band however did not put out any new material, and following death of Jeremy Ward in May 2003 due to drug overdose, any future re-groupings of De Facto appeared highly unlikely.\n\nIn a radio interview conducted by Radionica Colombia on 28 October 2008, Cedric Bixler-Zavala revealed that after returning from the South American leg of the current Mars Volta tour, new De Facto material may possibly be recorded. In the same interview, Bixler-Zavala also stated that he will be returning to the drums for the production. To date, it has not been confirmed if the sessions actually happened.\n\nSince 2001 the only new De Facto release had been the live footage from the January 3, 2001 show at The Smell, Los Angeles, included on the Gold Standard Laboratories DVD \"GSL Lab Results Vol. 1 Live\" in 2007. Omar Rodriguez-Lopez however mentioned the possibility of releasing a documentary from the band's European tours, as well as previously unreleased tracks from Mario Caldato Jr. sessions.\n\nIkey Owens died of a heart attack in 2014, while on tour with Jack White.\n\nDe Facto's general style was instrumental dub, influenced by the heady sounds of the likes of King Tubby and Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. However they also dabbled in electronica, Latin and salsa music, and jazz fusion. The band's writing process was largely improvisational, based on an exchange of ideas using drum and bass rhythms as the songs' spines. A lot of those ideas led to what would become the members' next band, The Mars Volta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1922658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922658", "title": "Gorgo (film)", "text": "Gorgo (film)\n\nGorgo is a 1961 science fiction monster film directed by Eugène Lourié. Shot in Technicolor, the film is an international co-production of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Ireland. The film is about Gorgo, a sea monster captured and taken to London for exploitation, and its even larger mother, which rampages across London in search of it.\n\nCaptain Joe Ryan is salvaging for treasure off the coast of Ireland, when a volcano erupts, nearly sinking his ship. Ryan and his first officer, Sam Slade, take the ship to Nara Island for repairs. As they enter harbour, they discover the floating carcasses of ancient marine animals, the first hint that something dangerous was awoken by the volcano eruption.\n\nRyan and Slade consult the harbour master, who also has archaeological pretensions: he has been salvaging in the harbour. Some of his men have disappeared mysteriously; it turns out that one has died of fear. After dark, a monstrous creature surfaces, attacks a group of fishermen, then comes ashore to wreak havoc on the island. This dinosaur-like creature is supposedly 65 feet tall. The people of the island finally drive it off.\n\nRyan and his crew manage to capture the monster and haul it aboard their ship, tying it to the deck. Soon, university scientists arrive on Nara, hoping to collect the monster for study, but Ryan has been offered a better deal by the owner of a circus in London. When the ship arrives in London, the circus owner names it \"Gorgo\", after the snake-haired woman, the Gorgon Medusa. It is exhibited to the public in Battersea Park.\n\nThe scientists examine Gorgo and conclude that he is not yet an adult and that his mother must be at least 200 feet tall. Then, an even larger sea monster attacks Nara Island and trashes the buildings, sinks a Royal Navy vessel and is impervious to attacks from other warships. Later, Ogra, now identified as probably Gorgo's mother, comes ashore in London and rampages through the city, destroying buildings including Tower Bridge, despite being bombarded by tanks and infantry and jet fighters, all having no effect. Having demolished a swathe through London, Ogra finds Gorgo and both return to the sea.\n\n\nThe film was originally intended to be set in Japan as an homage to Godzilla; the setting was then changed to France, and then finally changed to the British Isles. According to Bill Warren's film book \"Keep Watching the Skies\", southern Australia was also considered for a locale, but the producers supposedly decided that audiences \"wouldn't care\" if a monster attacked Australia; its alleged lack of worldwide recognisable landmarks for Gorgo to destroy was also cited as a consideration.\n\nThe location where Gorgo first appears, the fictional Nara Island, is probably a tribute to the Godzilla series; Nara being a historical period of Japan: alternatively, it may be an anagram for the Aran Islands, off Ireland's west coast. The exterior scenes set in Ireland were filmed at Bulloch Harbour and Coliemore Harbour, both near the County Dublin town of Dalkey. Other scenes were filmed at the MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.\n\nScenes where Gorgo is driven through the streets of London were shot on a Sunday morning, when there was little other traffic. The film studio wanted Gorgo to fight the military, despite director Eugène Lourié's objections. Later, Lourié acquired a print of the film and removed the footage.\n\nGorgo's special effects were achieved by suitmation and miniaturization, a technique pioneered in the \"Godzilla\" films. The younger Gorgo was smaller than usual giant monsters so the sets around him were built to a larger scale leading to a greater sense of realism. The creatures were also shot with then-pricey slow-motion cameras to create a sense of scale. The effects were complex and are well respected by special effects artists and fans. The film is also sometimes praised for its innovative ending, in which, unusually for such films, the monsters survive and prevail.\n\nThe film is one in which every (human) member of the cast is male, with females only visible in the crowd scenes in London.\n\nA novelization of the film was released in paperback at the time of its original release (\"Gorgo\" by Carson Bingham (Monarch Books 1960)).\n\nFrom 1961 to 1965, Charlton Comics published 23 issues of the comic book \"Gorgo\". It included work by Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko. The series was renamed \"Fantastic Giants\" with issue #24,which turned out to be the last issue of the series.\n\nGorgo also appeared in a three-issue miniseries that started off as \"Gorgo's Revenge\", before it was renamed \"The Return of Gorgo\" with issue #2. The series ran from 1962–1964.\n\nIn 1990, Steve Ditko illustrated a back-up story in \"Web of Spider-Man Annual\" #6 titled \"Child Star\". In this story Captain Universe creates huge versions of toys based on Gorgo and Konga to battle giant monsters that are attacking the neighborhood. For trademark reasons, Gorgo's name was altered to \"Gorga\".\n\nIn 1991, A-Plus Comics reprinted issues #1 and #3 in the one-shot comic \"Attack of the Mutant Monsters\". Due to copyright issues, Gorgo's name was changed to Kegor. \n\nSome of these issues were reprinted (in black and white) in a trade paperback in 2011 called \"Angry Apes n' Leapin Lizards\". \n\nIn March 2013, IDW Publishing reprinted all the issues that artist Steve Ditko worked on (\"Gorgo\" #1–3, #11 and #13–16 and \"The Return of Gorgo\" #2–3) as a deluxe hardcover collection called \"Steve Ditko's Monsters: Gorgo\".\n\nIn April of 2019, IDW published a book called \"Gorgo vs. Konga\" which collected issues #1 and #13 of the series.\n\n\nIn 1998, the film was featured on the television series \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", but the rights quickly expired and the episode only had two airings, both on the same day.\n\nGorgo was used by rock band Ash for the promo video for . It was the seventh release of their A to Z singles series, a year-long 26-single subscription. Using a copy of the DVD and free movie editing software, the video allegedly only cost $8.00 to produce.\n\nIn 2010, a short comedy film, \"Waiting for Gorgo\", was produced by Cinemagine. The film was directed by Benjamin Craig and written by M. J. Simpson. The plot focuses on the D.M.O.A, a fictitious British government agency charged with preventing the return of the monster Gorgo.\n\nFormer Maine governor Angus King used a clip from \"Gorgo\" in an advertisement for his 2012 run for the United States Senate.\n\nIn the Disney remake \"Flubber\", Flubber was seen flicking through television channels when it had separated into several versions of itself. Scenes of Gorgo's mother rampaging through London could be seen flashing on the screen as Flubber is switching channels.\n\nGorgo made a cameo in \"The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat\".\n\n"}

He was the founding president of the National Alliance of State Health CO-OPs (NASHCO), which includes all Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans authorized and funded under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He is also co-founder and vice-chair of the Montana Health CO-OP, one of the first CO-OPs to be approved for funding by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Morrison is a senior partner at Morrison Sherwood Wilson Deola, a public interest law firm based in Helena, Montana. In 2006, he ran unsuccessfully against Jon Tester in the Montana Democratic primary for the United States Senate nomination.\n\nIn the 1990s, Morrison was lead Montana counsel in the state's Tobacco litigation and represented the New York Times, NBC and other national media in the Unabomber case. Morrison and his wife are co-authors of a Montana political history book: \"Mavericks: The Lives and Battles of Montana's Political Heroes.\" Morrison also authored or co-authored other published works on topics ranging from health insurance to climate change.\n\nMorrison served as Montana State Auditor and State Insurance and Securities Commissioner from 2001–2008. He promoted and implemented Insure Montana, a small business health insurance pool with discounted premiums paid for by an increase in the tobacco tax. Morrison had been advocating the use of increased tobacco tax revenue to reduce health insurance premiums since 2002. Insure Montana won national awards, and became a model for the premium assistance provisions of the Affordable Care Act. John Morrison also drafted Montana's Initiative 155 (I-155) and led the campaign that created Healthy Montana Kids, which instituted a broad reform and massive expansion of children's health coverage. In the first year of operation, it brought over $200 million in new federal matching dollars into Montana and covered 10,000 additional children. Healthy Montana Kids now covers 91,000 Montana Children.\n\nAs Insurance Commissioner, Morrison banned \"discretionary clauses\" in group health and disability insurance plans and successfully defended the ban at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in \"Standard Ins. Co v. Morrison\", 584 F. 3d 837 (2009). Through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), Morrison led passage of a similar model law that has been adopted in more than a dozen states, including New York, California, Michigan, Illinois, and Texas. Morrison also led NAIC opposition to Association Health Plans and fraudulent health insurance.\n\nMorrison chaired the Health Insurance and Managed Care Committee and the Market Regulation and Consumer Affairs Committee of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, as well as the NAIC's September 11 emergency task force. As the NAIC's International Vice Chair for Asia, Morrison helped establish the relationship between U.S. and Chinese insurance regulators and, with the US Trade Representative, represented the U.S. in the US-China Insurance Dialogues, WTO Doha Round, in Hangzhou, PRC.\n\nAfter leaving office, Morrison was appointed by the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner to replace former Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop on the boards of the Senior Health Care Oversight Trust and the Senior Health Insurance Company of Pennsylvania (SHIP) and chaired both boards in 2011. Morrison also serves on the board of the Center for Health Policy Development, parent organization of the National Academy of State Health Policy.\n\nIn 2006, Morrison was a candidate for the U.S. Senate in a contested Democratic primary with Jon Tester, the President of the Montana Senate at the time. Morrison initially polled ahead of incumbent Republican Conrad Burns, and was leading in the primary race, but it narrowed to a \"deadlock\" a week prior to the election. Morrison was beaten in the Democratic primary by Tester, who then defeated Burns in November.\n\nDuring the Democratic Primary, it was revealed that Morrison had an extramarital affair in 1998. Morrison and his wife remained together despite the affair. According to the \"Missoula Independent\", the woman involved later married the principal of companies investigated by the state auditors office while Morrison was there. Former staffers reported to the \"Independent\" that they repeatedly advised Morrison to stay out of the case entirely to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest, but they felt that he had not. Morrison's affair reportedly did not affect the outcome of the probe, and the individual investigated was convicted of fraud. The case in question was handled by outside attorney Beth Baker due to Morrison's various involvements. Baker said she was given significant discretion in handling the case.\n\nIn 2012 Morrison, who had become President of the National Alliance of State Health CO-OPs, and supported federal low interest loans to CO-OPs argued against Congressional plans to cut the loan funds from the federal budget. Morrison said the 24 existing CO-OPs would increase competition and innovation in the health insurance marketplace. In October 2013, he released a study showing that premiums were 8.4% lower in states that had a CO-OP than in states that did not. In February 2014, Morrison estimated that 300,000 Americans had signed up for CO-OPs to date despite early technical problems.\n\nIn 2015 he testified before the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations about shutdowns of CO-OPs in various state healthcare exchanges; he said that the situation was the fault of both the Obama administration and Congress. The Obama administration's decision to forbid CO-OPs from limiting the number of policies they sold while at the same time limiting their ability to raise money ruined their finances, and Congress' cutting loans available to them also harmed their financial viability.\n"}
{"id": "1922669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922669", "title": "Victoria Lord", "text": "Victoria Lord\n\nVictoria Lord is a fictional character and matriarch of the Lord family on the American soap opera \"One Life to Live\", played for over 41 years by six-time Daytime Emmy Award-winning actress Erika Slezak.\n\nThe character was created as one of the main protagonists by series creator Agnes Nixon, and first cast to Gillian Spencer on the pilot aired July 15, 1968. Nixon later recast her with Slezak, who became synonymous with the character role following a continual portrayal spanning her debut March 17, 1971 through the ABC Daytime finale January 13, 2012. Slezak reprised the role in The Online Network continuance of \"One Life to Live\" aired on Hulu, iTunes, FX Canada, and the Oprah Winfrey Network from April 29, 2013 through the final episode released August 19, 2013.\n\nThe role of Victoria is the mainstay original lead character of the serial, and her storylines focus on drudgery, love, and family troubles. One of the longest-running characters on American daytime television, Victoria weathers widowhood (three times), divorce (four times), a brain aneurysm, a near-death out-of-body experience (three times), being shot (two times), sent to jail, suffering a stroke, breast cancer, rape, a heart attack, heart disease, a heart transplant, the abduction of three of her five children as infants, the deaths of two siblings, and the death of her daughter from lupus. Most notably, she suffers recurring bouts with dissociative identity disorder throughout the show narrative.\n\nSlezak's tenure as Victoria earned the actress a reputation as a leading actor in American serials, with her portrayal becoming one of the most lauded and longest-running in American soap operas.\n\n\"One Life to Live\" series creator Agnes Nixon conceived the central role of Victoria \"Viki\" Lord inspired by her relationship with her domineering father, Harry Eckhardt, and her own married family life along the Philadelphia Main Line in Bryn Mawr. Nixon took further inspiration from lead protagonist Tracy Lord of the 1939 play \"The Philadelphia Story\", portrayed on stage and film by actress Katharine Hepburn.\n\nThe role of Victoria was originally cast to Gillian Spencer, who appeared from the July 1968 debut until 1970. Joanne Dorian replaced Spencer from October 1970 until March 16, 1971, when established theater actress Erika Slezak stepped into the role in the following day's episode. Slezak was told she was auditioning for a new character, but when offered the role she learned she was replacing someone else. The producers informed Ernest Graves and Lynn Benesch, who played Viki's father Victor Lord and sister Meredith, of the change in advance, but no one else in the cast or crew knew of the switch when Slezak arrived to work. Slezak became synonymous with the character role since her first appearance in the role March 17, 1971, playing Victoria continually for 41 years until the original \"One Life\" television finale in 2012. Slezak reprised the role onscreen upon Prospect Park resumption of the serial from April 29, 2013 through the final episode released August 19, 2013.\n\nTwo other actresses portrayed Victoria while Slezak was on maternity and personal leave: Christine Jones in 1980 and 1981, and Judith Barcroft in 1987. In the summer of 2003, Slezak's real-life daughter, Amanda Davies, portrayed a teenaged Victoria in flashbacks. Leah Marie Hays played the role of a young Victoria Lord in a series of flashbacks as well.\n\nAt the death of show and character creator Agnes Nixon in 2016, Slezak eulogized that, \"When she hired me to play Viki on \"One Life To Live\", she changed my life and my career and I will forever be grateful to her.\"\n\nSlezak expressed interest for reprising portrayal of the character in a short-term guest appearance on ABC's last remaining soap opera, \"General Hospital\", in a March 2018 interview with \"Soap Opera Digest\" magazine, ahead of the 50th anniversary of the July 1968 premiere of \"One Life to Live\".\n\nAt the debut episode of \"One Life to Live\" July 15, 1968, twentysomething recent college graduate and heiress Victoria \"Viki\" Lord is described by author Martha Nochimson as \"blonde [and] ivory-complexioned ... the clichéd American princess,\" personifying the \"woman on a pedestal\" archetype. The show's heroine from the outset, ingenue Victoria initially harbors a strong Electra complex and suffers a bout with multiple personalities prompted by her mother Eugenia's absence from childhood and father Victor's incessant grooming of her to eventually helm the family's communication business, Lord Enterprises. As Erika Slezak stepped into the role in 1971, head writer Nixon matured Victoria to a self-assured working woman managing fictional Llanview's predominant newspaper, \"The Banner\". An increasingly headstrong Victoria, relinquishing her primal desires to pander to Victor, marries working-class \"Banner\" editor Joe Riley, much to the patriarch's chagrin.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Victoria largely adopts a matronly role along with her capacities as well-connected town businesswoman and socialite, though she is still plagued with intermittent bouts of mental illness. The character comes to mother five of her own children onscreen (three from infancy), while providing surrogate nurture to younger siblings Tina and Todd. Since 2000s, the role has evolved to be regarded as the \"grande dame of Llanview.\" In a 2006 \"Boston\" magazine article, Slezak remarked of Victoria representing \"the very classy, very old-world money,\" with writer Michael Callahan calling the character \"the stiff-upper-lipped matriarch\" of the prominent Lord family.\n\nAmerican journalist and soap opera critic Connie Passalacqua Hayman (pen name \"Marlena De Lacroix\") briefly summed up the character role:\n\n... Slezak's 'Viki' is the consummate soap opera heroine, because she has so harrowingly and humanistically triumphed over all her life's tragedies.\n\nThe eldest child of domineering millionaire publisher Victor Lord (Ernest Graves), Victoria Lord, often nicknamed \"Viki,\" (originally Spencer) has little time for romance when \"One Life to Live\" begins in 1968. She clashes with reporter Joe Riley (Lee Patterson), but they soon fall in love; Victor disapproves and tries to keep them apart. Torn between pleasing her father and following her heart, Viki develops a wild alternate personality named \"Niki Smith\", who falls in love with Vinny Wolek (Antony Ponzini). Viki's illness — apparently caused by seeing her pregnant mother fall down the stairs as a child — is eventually treated, and she and Joe marry December 11, 1969. Joe is presumed dead in a car accident in 1970, and a heartbroken Viki (Slezak onward) finds comfort with fellow reporter Steve Burke (Bernie Grant) in 1971. After Steve is put on trial and exonerated for the murder of \"Banner\" secretary Marcy Wade (Francesca James), he and Viki marry in 1972. When a very-much alive Joe returns in-time for the nuptials, having survived his supposedly deadly car accident, Viki is forced to choose between two husbands. Viki initially stays married to Steve out of obligation, but ultimately divorces him in January 1974. That summer, Dr. Dorian Cramer (then Nancy Pinkerton) blames board member Viki for her suspension from Llanview Hospital, and a rivalry is born that will last decades. Viki and Joe remarry in a simple, New York City ceremony in September. In 1975, Dorian becomes the private physician to Viki's father Victor, soon eloping with him. Viki learns she has a half-brother, Tony Lord (George Reinholt), and Dorian plots to keep Victor's fortune for herself. In 1976, Victor suffers a heart attack and dies after wife Dorian denies him medication, and in his wake Dorian wreaks havoc on the Lord family. Viki and Joe have a son, Kevin Lord Riley, who is soon kidnapped by jealous Cathy Craig Lord (then Jennifer Harmon), but is later returned. In 1978, Viki takes in Tina Clayton (Andrea Evans), the sixteen-year-old daughter of college roommate and best friend Irene Manning Clayton (Kate McKeown), who is apparently dying of cancer. Shortly after Irene dies, Viki goes on trial for the murder of her nemesis Marco Dane (Gerald Anthony), but she is later exonerated following confessional testimony by Karen Wolek (Judith Light). Joe dies from a brain tumor in October 1979, and Viki gives birth to their second son, Joe Riley, Jr., in January 1980.\n\nAfter a disastrous relationship with con man Ted Clayton, who brainwashes and drugs her in an attempt to get his hands on her fortune, Viki marries newspaper editor Clint Buchanan (Clint Ritchie) in 1982; he adopts both of her sons. Echo DiSavoy (Kim Zimmer), seeking revenge on Clint for her mother's murder, seduces him in 1983 to ruin his marriage, then fakes her own death and frames him for it. Clint is later exonerated after Echo is found alive, and he and Viki reunite. Viki is shocked to discover in 1985 that her former ward Tina Clayton (Evans) is in fact her half-sister, daughter of Viki's father Victor and not Ted. Thanks to the machinations of Tina's boyfriend Mitch Laurence (Roscoe Born), Viki succumbs to the pressure and Niki Smith returns. Posing as Viki, Niki divorces Clint; Viki later overcomes her illness with the realization that it had actually been triggered by her witnessing Victor and Irene in bed many years before. Clint and Viki remarry in 1986, and Viki gives birth to their daughter Jessica Buchanan in September 1986. Jessica is kidnapped shortly after birth by Allison Perkins (Barbara Garrick), a disciple of Mitch Laurence; Jessica is soon returned unharmed in December, and Allison institutionalized. In 1988, Viki learns that she married and gave birth to a child in high school with high school sweetheart Roger Gordon (Larry Pine), but father Victor had her hypnotized to forget the occurrences. With Viki's memory restored in 1989, she annuls her 1960s off-screen marriage to Roger and initiates a relationship with daughter Megan Gordon (Jessica Tuck), an actress on the soap opera (within a soap opera), \"Fraternity Row\". Megan and Viki initially spar, but ultimately get past their initial conflicts and become close.\n\nIn 1990, Viki is elected mayor of Llanview, but a shooting and subsequent stroke leaves her paralyzed and in a wheelchair; Niki Smith emerges to aid a paralyzed Viki stand up and shoot Johnny Dee Hesser (Anthony Crivello) when he attacks Tina. Viki recovers and later donates a kidney to daughter Megan suffering terminal lupus, but Megan dies, leaving Viki devastated. Growing ever-distant from Clint, Viki engages an extramarital affair with Sloan Carpenter (Roy Thinnes); she and Clint divorce in 1994, and she marries Sloan. Sloan dies soon after from Hodgkin's lymphoma, just as the existence of a second child of Victor and Irene's is revealed. Viki's stress reaches a critical point when Dorian (Robin Strasser onward) tells Viki a secret of which she thought Viki had been aware: the fact that Victor had sexually abused his daughter as a child. With this trauma being what had actually initiated Viki's dissociative identity disorder, she subsequently splinters into several personalities, one of which imprisons Dorian in a secret room below Llanfair. Dorian is eventually freed from her confinement, and Viki recovers after realizing she herself (more specifically, one of her alternate personalities) was the one who had smothered Victor to death in 1976. In 1995, reviled town outcast Todd Manning (Roger Howarth) is proven to be Victor and Irene's illegitimate son; Viki and Todd eventually become close. After a failed reconciliation attempt with Clint, Viki meets and falls in love with Ben Davidson (Mark Derwin), who is eventually revealed to be the long-lost son of Asa Buchanan (Philip Carey) and Renée Divine Buchanan (Patricia Elliott). Ben's first wife, Skye Chandler (Robin Christopher), comes to town and tries in vain to keep Ben and Viki apart.\n\nViki is diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000, but survives after a mastectomy and chemotherapy. She and Ben marry in November. In 2001, a girl named Natalie Balsom (Melissa Archer) makes the startling claim that she is Viki and Clint's biological daughter, which is confirmed by a DNA test. Mitch Laurence returns from the dead, divulging to Viki he drugged and raped her around the same time she and Clint conceived Jessica and had unknowingly become pregnant with fraternal twins, one fathered by Clint, Natalie, and the other fathered by Mitch, Jessica (Erin Torpey). Unable to reconcile the revelation, Niki Smith emerges during the ordeal and plots to kill Ben in order to have her freedom, but when Ben is accidentally shot by Antonio Vega (Kamar de los Reyes), Viki returns. Ben is left comatose after the shooting. In 2003, Victor (William Stone Mahoney) is ostensibly revealed to be alive, claiming to have faked his death in 1976; however, shortly after he returns, Victor dies — but not before Viki and Todd confront him on ills inflicted to them in his wake. In 2004, Viki is diagnosed with heart disease and eventually needs a heart transplant. Coincidentally, a comatose Ben dies just as Viki takes a turn for the worse, and his heart is transplanted into Viki, who recovers but must face widowhood once again.\n\nIn 2007, Viki and Clint (Jerry verDorn) start dating again, but Dorian decides she wants Clint for herself and plots to break up the couple. Dorian's schemes succeed, and Clint ends things with Viki to start a new relationship with Dorian. Feeling humiliated and defeated, Viki leaves Llanview for a much-needed vacation and finds herself in Paris, Texas, where she tries to reinvent herself by waiting tables at a local diner. It is there that she meets patron Charlie Banks (Brian Kerwin), a recovering alcoholic, and the two begin seeing one another. Viki ultimately returns to Llanview once her family discovers her secret life, and Charlie's search for his estranged son Jared (John Brotherton) leads him there as well. Viki and Charlie resume their relationship, but break up when Viki discovers that Charlie had lied about the identity of his son in extenuating circumstances. In July 2008, Viki is involved in a car accident with Dorian; Viki's heart stops as a result of the crash, but Dorian manages to revive her. Reexamining her life, Viki reunites with Charlie, and they marry on August 4, 2009. Viki runs for mayor against Dorian and wins; she steps down, however, to help her family deal with the unexpected return of Mitch Laurence, who wreaks havoc on her daughters and murders Jared in the process.\n\nCharlie, devastated over his son's death, quits his sobriety and began drinking, distancing himself from Viki, choosing instead to conspire with Dorian to kill Mitch. Though Dorian tries to stop him at the last minute, Charlie ends up accidentally shooting Jessica (Bree Williamson onward), who survives. Devastated by Charlie's actions, Viki asks him for a divorce, but they eventually reconcile. Viki and Charlie's marriage is further complicated by the return of Echo DiSavoy, a woman who almost destroyed her marriage to Clint in 1983. Echo begins insinuating herself into Charlie and Viki's marriage, much to Viki's dismay. When a paternity revealed Charlie not to be the father of Rex Balsom (John-Paul Lavoisier), a devastated Charlie turns to Echo for comfort. Dorian, who had suspicions about Echo and Charlie's dealings, forged a truce with Viki to uncover Charlie's misgivings. A devastated Viki finds out about Charlie's affair and definitively asks him for a divorce. After confronting Charlie and Echo, Viki goes to court to fight for custody of grandson Ryder Ford while his mother Jessica was ill with her multiple personality. A stressed Viki suffers a bout with multiple personalities on the stand, leading the judge against giving the child to Viki but instead to her son and daughter-in-law, Joey (Tom Degnan) and Aubrey Buchanan (Terri Conn).\n\nIn summer 2011 a man with the \"original\" face of her only known living brother, Todd (Howarth), returned to Llanview claiming to be the victim of eight years of imprisonment and torture at the hands of his mother and Viki's childhood friend, a back-from-the-dead Irene Manning (Barbara Rhoades). After medical tests revealed the \"newer\" Todd (Trevor St. John) and the \"old\" Todd (Howarth) to have identical DNA, Irene appeared to reveal the \"two Todds\" to be twins. The man who resembled Walker Laurence (St. John) and who has been living as Todd since 2003 was revealed actually have been born Victor Lord, Jr., brainwashed into believing that he is Todd by Irene. Meanwhile, Viki agrees in court to put up Clint in Llanfair for house arrest after he was convicted of various crimes in Llanview. Dorian and Viki ostensibly put an end to their feud of nearly four decades when Dorian leaves town to become an acting U.S. senator. Viki continues work at \"The Banner\" when Tina returns to town for the reading of the will of recently murdered Victor, Jr. After months of rehashing old feelings and living under the same roof, Clint and Viki too admit to their unresolved feelings and agreed to give a romantic relationship one more try.\n\nAt the original finale, a prison breakout leads Allison Perkins to shoot both Clint and Viki, but only after telling the two that Jessica was in fact Clint's daughter and not the daughter of Mitch Laurence. Clint sanctioned another paternity test and, in the presence of Jessica, Viki, and Natalie, revealed Allison's claim to be true. Following all the emotional revelations and tears, Clint again declares his undying love for Viki and asks her to marry him for a third time.\n\nUpon the series resumption in April 2013, Viki accepts Clint's marriage proposal, and concurrently hires freelance journalist Jeffrey King (Corbin Bleu) to investigate the alleged congressional malfeasance of junior U.S. senator Dorian. Upon visiting niece Danielle Manning (Kelley Missal) in the hospital after overdosing on drugs and alcohol, she uncovers her brother Victor, Jr. to be alive. With her family newspaper in financial straits, \"The Banner\" focuses on growing the publication's online presence.\n\nAs of the final ABC episode, all of Victoria's six alternate personalities are integrated with her baseline psyche. At times during the series, Viki has been forced to impersonate one of them, particularly Niki and Jean. In order of their first appearance on \"One Life to Live\", they are:\n\nSeries fansite \"Llanview Labyrinth\" remarks that although Gillian Spencer's Victoria is featured at the show's outset, \"the obviousness of Viki being the show[']s unquestioned 'lead' did not smack the viewer quite as hard as it later would [with Erika Slezak's portrayal],\" with Spencer's Victoria melding into the ensemble cast. Joanne Dorian briefly stepped into the role beginning in October 1970, with a markedly less dynamic presence on the series than her predecessor.\n\nIn March 1971, \"One Life to Live\" executive producer Doris Quinlan remarked to \"After Noon TV\" magazine of Erika Slezak and her audition before herself, series creator and head writer Agnes Nixon, and director David Pressman, \"You've got to meet this girl—she's going to be a star.\"\n\nSince the introduction of Slezak as Victoria, her portrayal has become regarded as definitive to the role. Slezak's work has garnered her the acclaim of media critics and viewers alike, earning the actress comparisons between herself and contemporary film star Meryl Streep for perceived similarities in acting range, versatility, and numerous award nominations. Slezak has received nine Daytime Emmy Award nominations in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress for her portrayal of Victoria, winning in 1984, 1986, 1992, 1995, 1996, and 2005. At the finale of the show's last iteration, she held the record for most Emmy wins by an actress. She also garnered the \"Soap Opera Digest\" Award for Favorite Couple with co-star Mark Derwin (Ben Davidson) in 2000.\n\nIn 2002, in recognition for her work on \"One Life to Live\", Slezak was inducted as a member of the Silver Circle of the New York chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for over a quarter-century of \"significant contributions\" to television.\n\n"}

He served as a general under Süleyman Pasha, Murad I, Bayezid I, Süleyman Çelebi and Mehmed I.\n\nByzantine sources mention him as Εβρενός, Ἀβρανέζης, Βρανέζης, Βρανεύς (?), Βρενέζ, Βρενέζης, Βρενές. A persistent Greek legend maintains that Evrenos' father was a certain Ornos, renegade Byzantine governor of Bursa who defected to the Ottomans, and then on to Karasi, after the Siege of Bursa, in 1326. He was known as Isa Bey Prangi, buried in the village of Prangi (also known as Sırcık or Kırcık in Ottoman sources), a busy ferry-place on the Evros river about east from Didymoteicho. Stanford J. Shaw and Joseph von Hammer regard Evrenos as a Byzantine convert to Islam.\n\nΟriginally, Gazi Evrenos was a noble dignitary, a bey in the principality of Karasi, joining the Ottomans only after their conquest of the beylik in 1345. He led many crucial Ottoman campaigns and battles in Bulgaria, Thessaly, and Serbia. After having participated in the Ottoman conquest of Adrianopolis in 1362, Evrenos was appointed to \"uc beği\" (frontier warlord) of Thessaly. He and his \"akıncıs\" fought in the Battle of Kosovo (1389) and the Battle of Nicopolis (1396). Evrenos conquered Keşan, İpsala, Komotini, Feres, Xanthi, Maroneia, Serres, Monastir, and, in 1397, Corinth. He founded the town Yenice-i Vardar, modern Giannitsa. The inhabitants of Gianitsa (Ottoman: Yenice Vardar) down to the early 20th century displayed reverence for \"Gazi Baba\", that is \"papa Gazi\".\n\nGazi Evrenos Bey was father of seven sons (Khidr-shah, Isa, Suleyman, Ali, Yakub, Barak, Begdje) and several daughters.\nAmong the numerous descendants of lord Gazi Evrenos, apparently the memory of some has dived into oblivion, as their deeds got incorporated into the achievements of their illustrious forefather. This explains the legendary, yet unlikely, 129-year lifespan of lord Gazi.\n\nTogether with the Mihaloğulları (from the Karasi emirate), Malkoçoğulları (from Serbia), Ömerli/Ömeroğlu, and the Turahanoğulları, Evrenos' descendants, the Evrenosoğulları, constitute one of the Byzantine families that effectively formed the early Ottoman warrior nobility.\n\nGazi Evrenos died at an advanced age in Yenice-i Vardar. He was buried in a mausoleum there in 1417. The mausoleum survives but was badly mutilated in 19th century and served for a time as an agricultural store.\n\nAs one of the most successful Ottoman commanders, Evrenos acquired a considerable amount of wealth and founded numerous endowments (\"awqaf\"). Several monuments attributed to him survive in southeastern Europe. Of primary importance is his mausoleum, or türbe, with its accompanying epitaph in Giannitsa. A hammam of Evrenos stands to the south of the mausoleum. Two other monuments stand in Greek Thrace.\n\n\n"}

It also may exhibit small protuberances from the top and may show the cauliflower form characteristic of cumulus clouds. Cumulus mediocris clouds do not generally produce precipitation of more than very light intensity, but can further advance into clouds such as Cumulus congestus or Cumulonimbus, which do produce precipitation.\n\nCumulus mediocris is also classified as a low cloud and is coded C2 by the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nCumulus mediocris is brilliantly white when sunlit, and is dark underneath. A single pattern-based variety, Cumulus radiatus, is sometime seen when the individual clouds are arranged into parallel rows. The resulting formations are known as \"cloud streets\" and are aligned nearly parallel to the wind.\n\nCumulus mediocris may have precipitation-based features like virga, and may form Cumulus praecipitato clouds. The pannus supplementary feature is sometimes seen with precipitating Cumulus mediocris, but in this case the C7 reporting code normally used with to identify pannus is usually superseded by C2, since there is significant vertical development. \"Pileus\" (cap cloud), \"velum\" (apron), \"arcus\" (roll or shelf cloud) and \"tuba\" (vertical column) features are also occasionally seen with cumulus mediocris. Cumulus mediocris may form as a result of a partial transformation of altocumulus or stratocumulus. This genus and species type may also be the result of a complete transformation of stratocumulus or stratus.\n\nThese clouds are common in the advance of a cold front or in unstable atmospheric conditions such as an area of low pressure. They can grow into larger Cumulus congestus which could bring rain, winds and in worse cases, thunder and lightning. If these clouds are present in the morning or early afternoon they show a significant instability in the atmosphere likely leading to storms later in the day.\n\nThese clouds occur when there is more rising air than the Cumulus humilis. Like any cumulus cloud, this cloud requires convection before developing. This occurs when pockets of air around them become warmer and begin to rise. As the air rises, it condenses forming a Cumulus humilis cloud as it continues to rise, a Cumulus mediocris.\n\n"}

The film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta and Kirron Kher in prominent roles. Set and mostly taking place in New York City, the film explores themes of adultery. The title was promoted with the tag-line \"\"A Love... That Broke All Relationships\"\". \n\nThe film released worldwide on 11 August 2006. It was a success internationally, especially in the United States. It became the highest grossing Indian film of all time overseas at the time of its release. The film was screened in over 1,200 cinemas worldwide, grossing a worldwide total of (). It was screened at the Tokyo International Film Festival.\n\nMaya (Rani Mukerji) is an orphan who is to marry her closest childhood friend Rishi Talwar (Abhishek Bachchan). The two have been raised by Rishi's fun-loving millionaire father Samarjit a.k.a. Sam (Amitabh Bachchan). Dev Saran (Shah Rukh Khan) is a successful soccer player who lives in New York City with his wife Rhea (Preity Zinta), his son Arjun (Ahsaas Channa) and his mother Kamaljit a.k.a. Kamal (Kirron Kher). Maya meets Dev moments before she is to marry Rishi. Although the two are strangers, they connect instantly. Right after they part, Dev is hit by a car and permanently injures his leg. As a result, he can no longer play soccer ever again.\n\nFour years later, Dev, who now walks with a limp, is extremely short-tempered and embittered because of his inability to play soccer; Rhea's successful career makes him feel inferior to her. Meanwhile, Maya is infertile and does not love Rishi, seeing him as childish. Dev and Maya meet again and Rhea and Rishi strike a professional relationship. Sam and Kamal, having lost their spouses, become friends to help one another through their loneliness. Dev and Maya decide to do the same; they become friends and try to give each other ideas to salvage their marriages, all of which comically fail.\n\nDev and Maya realise they have feelings for one another and not toward their partners. Rhea mentions that she has received a promotion and Dev goes into a rant, sneering that she is trying to show off. Rhea accuses Dev of being jealous of her professional success and makes him realize his failure of being a good husband and a good father because he cannot come out of his bitterness. At the same time, Rishi expresses his frustration at Maya's lack of affection and his resentment toward her infertility. Feeling worthless, Maya meets a disheartened Dev and the two confess that they have fallen in love with each other.\n\nDev and Maya begin an affair but feel guilty for playing with their spouses' feelings, as both Rhea and Rishi try their best to make their marriages work. Nevertheless, Dev and Maya give in and make love. They are later caught in an embrace by Sam and Kamal, who are shocked and upset that they have cheated despite both Rhea and Rishi trying to make it work. That night, Sam has a heart attack. On his deathbed, he advises Maya to leave Rishi as she is depriving both Rishi and herself of happiness in life. After Sam's death, Dev and Maya decide they must end their relationship and go back to their spouses, but first, they must tell them the truth about their extramarital affair because neither of them will be able to move on in the shadow of lies. Shocked, Rhea and Rishi divorce their spouses. Dev and Maya lie to each other and say that everything is fine, believing they'll never meet again. \n\nThree years later, Dev and Maya have been living alone, both miserable. Rishi visits Maya and says that he has fallen in love again and is remarrying. He invites Maya and Rhea to his wedding. Rhea attends with her boss Jay (Arjun Rampal), whom she is now dating. Rhea confronts Maya about the affair and reveals that she left Dev. However, as Rhea and Rishi have both moved on, they encourage Maya to as well, revealing that Dev is about to leave for Toronto by train. At the train station, Dev sees Maya but avoids her, believing she is still with Rishi. However, as the train pulls away, the two make eye contact. Seeing her tears, Dev pulls the emergency brake and comes back; the two reunite and start a new life together.\n\n\n\n\"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" was directed and written by Karan Johar who collaborated with Shibani Bathija to write the screenplay, and Niranjan Iyengar produced the dialogue. Produced by Dharma Productions, the soundtrack was performed by the musical trio, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar. Farah Khan was brought in to organize the choreographical aspects of the film, with costume designer Manish Malhotra, production designer Sharmishta Roy and MAC cosmetics all playing a major role in production.\n\nKajol was initially offered the role of Maya Talwar. When she refused, due to her prior commitments with Yash Raj Films's \"Fanaa\", the role was passed on to her cousin Rani Mukerji, who was supposed to play Preity Zinta's part. However, Kajol made a guest appearance in the song \"\"Rock 'N' Roll Soniye\"\".\n\nRiteish Deshmukh also had a guest appearance, but his scene was cut during the editing process.\n\n\"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" is set in New York City, while many of the scenes were filmed in East Hartford and New Haven in Connecticut. The soccer game scene was filmed at Rentschler Field, the home of the UConn Huskies football team. In several scenes, a light \"'UConn\"' can be seen on the field. The majority of the Grand Central Station scenes were filmed at New Haven's Union Station and Philadelphia's 30th Street Station.\n\nIn an interview, Karan Johar stated that the filming for the song \"Tumhi Dekho Naa\" was done at multiple locations and ended up being extremely time-consuming. The \"blue section\" of the song was shot at Columbia University in Upper West Side, the \"yellow section\" was shot at Wall Street in Lower Manhattan, the \"orange section\" at Bear Mountain, the \"red section\" at the Pier A Park in Hoboken, and the \"green section\" at the Union Station in New Haven. The red section was initially designed to take place in the rain. However, due to the low temperatures, the raindrops produced by the rain machines started freezing in mid-air. This posed a risk of physical harm to the actors. Consequently, the filmmakers decided to do away with the rain. However, they still wanted to make use of the 200 red umbrellas they had purchased. Eventually, they decided to shoot the red section on a sunny day where the actors used the umbrellas to block out the sun. The shooting for the green section also ran into problems. Two hundred extras were hired for the section but only fifteen showed up. Consequently, crew members present on the set wore the green costumes to take their place. Ayan Mukerji who was an Assistant Director of the film can be seen in a green sweater carrying a box in one of the frames.\n\nThe movie was filmed over a 90-day shooting period in the USA but a few scenes were shot on four large sets in Mumbai studios.\n\nMukerji suffered from a severe skin allergy during the filming in the US. \n\nLike previous Karan Johar movies (\"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\", \"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...\" and \"Kal Ho Naa Ho)\", \"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" has a four-word title that starts with a \"\"K\"\".\n\nThe music and background score of \"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" was composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, while the lyrics were penned by Javed Akhtar. This is the second time that lyricist Javed Akhtar and the composers Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy have teamed up for a Dharma production. The trio also replaces Johar's usual collaborators Jatin–Lalit, who had composed for his previous films. The audio rights were acquired by Sony Music India, under Sony BMG, teaming up with Karan Johar, for the third time after \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\" (1998) and \"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...\" (2001).\n\nThe title song \"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" rendered by Sonu Nigam and Alka Yagnik is a tearjerker. \"Mitwa\", an evocative sufi rock ballad, marked the introduction of Pakistani singer Shafqat Amanat Ali into the Bollywood scene. \"Where's The Party Tonight?\" by Shaan, Vasundhara Das, Loy and Shankar Mahadevan is the club song picturized on Abhishek and Preity. Then follows \"Tumhi Dekho Naa\", a soft and romantic ballad, which again is sung by the Sonu Nigam - Alka Yagnik duo is picturized on Shah Rukh and Rani. \"Rock 'N' Roll Soniye\", picturized on Amitabh, Abhishek and Preity is a 60's Rock 'N' Roll track, sung by Shankar Mahadevan, Shaan and Mahalakshmi Iyer. \"Farewell Trance\" is the trance version of the title track, which is a rarity in Bollywood. The album also has a remix - \"Mitwa - Revisted\". The soundtrack ends with a sad version of the title track, \"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna - Sad Version\" which speaks of destiny, meeting again in life and never saying goodbye. The trio took care to not make the album sound repetitive, especially since the overall genre of the soundtrack is similar to that of their previous chartbuster \"Kal Ho Naa Ho\" (2003).\n\nThe music of \"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" was launched in the United Kingdom on 14 June 2006 and was officially released in India on 21 June 2006 along with a grand music launch at the IIFA Awards function in Dubai.\n\nJoginder Tuteja of \"Bollywood Hungama\" dismissed those initial negative reaction, saying \"Much before the official release of the music album of \"KANK\", rumour brigade has been having a field day in pulling down the album. Well, that's not something new as with every biggie comes its share of detractors. But on hearing the songs for yourself, you realize that is it NOTHING, but a rumour! The album is yet another fine product from the team that delivers the kind of path-breaking music expected from it.\" Sukanya Verma of Rediff called the album \"a treat for the melody-starved.\"\n\nThe album opened at #1 and retained the top position in the music charts for ten straight weeks, despite facing tough competition from musical hits like \"Fanaa\", \"Krrish\" and \"Gangster\". According to the figures from \"BoxOffice India\", the album sold over 1,900,000 copies in India making it the second best selling album of the year, marginally behind \"Dhoom 2\".\n\n\"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\", with a multi-star cast, premiered on 11 August 2006 and was screened in over 1,200 cinemas worldwide.\n\nAccording to the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) originally gave the film an R rating because of language and some sexual content. It was re-rated PG-13 on appeal.\n\n\"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" was one of India's possible nominations for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, with films such as \"Rang De Basanti\", \"Krrish\", \"Omkara\" and \"Lage Raho Munna Bhai\" also in the running. However, the country ultimately chose \"Rang De Basanti\" as its pick.\n\nCritic Taran Adarsh described the subject matter as a delicate one which could have easily been disastrous and praised the way in which director Karan Johar boldly constructed the film, citing it as his finest work to date. Adarsh approved in particular of the script and the devices the director incorporated to contrast emotions between scenes, remarking that, \"the screenplay balances the two extremes; light moments and dollops of emotions with amazing ease\". The individual cast performances were also praised by Adarsh, who commented on the effectiveness of the casting and the interaction of the actors.\n\nRajeev Masand gave the film 4 out of 5 stars praising the screenplay and Johar's direction, saying \"Few writers have such solid control over their screenplay as Karan Johar does. Few understand the intricacies of narrative as well as he does. Johar goes from highs to lows, from plateaus to peaks with the ease of a pro. He knows exactly how to turn a seemingly ordinary scene into something special with just that one line of dialogue, or that hint of background music.\"\n\nDerek Elley of \"Variety\" also praised the diversity of emotions displayed by the cast, remarking that, \"Scripter Shibani Bathija never lets her characters inhabit a secure emotional place for very long, and impediments to happiness come from their own weaknesses rather than social constraints or plot-generated misunderstandings\". Elley noted Amitabh Bachchan's performance as an ageing lothario and praised Preity Zinta as \"stepping far beyond her makeup\".\n\nRaja Sen of \"rediff.com\" was particularly critical of the film, also expressing dissatisfaction with its length. He remarked, \"I feel older. A showing of Karan Johar's mammoth 22-reel \"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" has left me unbelievably exhausted. I walked out of the hall feeling my cheeks for stubble, wondering if my clothes are suddenly dated and my hair's turned grey. I've lost a sizeable chunk of my life, and you will too\". Unlike other critics, he identified flaws in the script and criticized the strength of characters saying \"The characters are cardboard, the setting is glitzy, the songs are tiresome, and the story oscillates between high melodrama and slapstick hilarity, going nowhere. Rarely has a weak script relied so completely on pretty people with big names to carry every line through\".\n\nIn the United States, the film received a number of positive reviews.\n\nCritics such as Neil Genzlinger of the \"New York Times\" emphasized the larger-than-life nature of the film, remarking that, \"It is full of big Bollywood stars and out-sized everything: the rainstorms are a little rainier than real life; the wind machines are cranked up an extra notch; the close-ups get closer and linger longer than usual; the coincidences that drive the plot are a little more numerous and unlikely than normal screenwriting allows\". He praised the humor in the script and the director's comic timing in certain scenes such as the children's soccer match, the bed store, and at the ballet show.\n\n\"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" saw a record opening at many cities in India and generated in the first week itself, although it is currently Johar's lowest-grossing film according to net collections, even if unadjusted for inflation. It emerged the highest grosser worldwide for an Indian film, surpassing \"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...\"'s five-year-old record.

The film was directed by James Seale.\n\nPhysics professor Zach Shefford (Grayson McCouch) has regarded his telekinetic gifts as a curse rather than a blessing. This sentiment is obviously not shared by ruthless Pentagon agent Raymond Addison (Louis Gossett Jr.), who recruits Shefford for a dangerous mission in which his \"second sight\" talents will be taxed to the utmost. It seems that, back in 1977, Addison had overseen Project Momentum, wherein dozens of telekinetics were brought together ostensibly for the purpose of benefiting mankind. But the project got out of hand when the participants' powers became too powerful and deadly, forcing Addison to kill them all.\n\nHowever, one of the participants, Adrian Geiger (Michael Massee), managed to escape, and is now at large, with a vast telekinetic army at his beck and call. It is Shefford's job to infiltrate Geiger's camp and finish the job that Addison had started. Upon falling in love with fellow telekinetic Tristen Geiger (Nicki Aycox), Shefford finds that his loyalties are wavering—and begins to suspect that the villains in this particular melodrama may in fact be the heroes, and vice versa.\n\nFBI agents Jordan Ripps (Teri Hatcher) and Frank McIntyre (Carmen Argenziano), who have been investigating an armored-car hijacking, follow Zach to Geiger. A telekinetic tug-of-war leads to a psychic showdown at the complex where Project Momentum was developed. Zach must finally choose the side to be on when telekinetic war breaks out. With Tristen prepared to follow in her father's footsteps and telekinetic sleeper cells in place across the nation, the momentum is building.\n\n\n"}

Muckler has over 50 years of professional hockey experience as a part owner, general manager, director of player personnel, director of hockey operations, head coach, assistant coach and player. He has been a part of five Stanley Cup championships in various roles.\n\nBorn in Midland, Ontario in 1934, and raised in Paris, Ontario, Muckler was a defenceman in the minor leagues for 13 seasons, playing the bulk of his career in the Eastern Hockey League (EHL).\n\nMuckler began his professional coaching career as a player/coach in 1959 with the EHL's New York Rovers. He then spent the next 20 years in off-ice positions with the New York Rangers, Minnesota North Stars and Vancouver Canucks before joining the Edmonton Oilers organization in 1981. During those 20 years, Muckler served briefly as head coach of the North Stars in 1968–69, and won multiple regular-season titles, playoff championships and league coach-of-the-year honours in the minor leagues. For his successes, \"The Sporting News\" named him the top coach in minor-league hockey in 1979.\n\nWhile with the Oilers, Muckler served as an assistant coach with the Stanley Cup winners under head coach/general manager Glen Sather in 1984 and 1985. After the 1984-85 season, Sather began splitting most coaching duties with Muckler, who was named assistant head coach. He won two more Cups in 1987 and 1988. When Sather relinquished his coaching duties in 1989, Muckler was promoted to head coach and led the club to its fifth Stanley Cup in seven years in 1990.\n\nIn 1991, Muckler left the Oilers organization and was hired by the Buffalo Sabres. Initially the club's director of hockey operations, he soon accepted the team's head coaching position and guided the Sabres for the next four seasons. He also assumed the role of Sabres' general manager in 1993. A finalist for the Jack Adams Award as NHL coach of the year in 1994, Muckler stepped down from coaching in 1995 to focus on his front-office duties and was named \"NHL Executive of the Year\" by \"The Sporting News\" for the 1996–97 season. Sabres President Larry Quinn fired Muckler in the 1997 offseason.\n\nMuckler last worked in the NHL as head coach of the New York Rangers from 1997 to 2000. His career coaching record is 276–288–84, combined with a 233–167–53–7 career record as an NHL general manager, and he has been involved in more than 2,000 professional games in varying roles. His résumé also includes three appearances at the National Hockey League All-Star Game and two appearances (1984 and 1987) on the coaching staff of the Canada Cup-winning Team Canada.\n\nMuckler joined the Ottawa Senators as general manager in June 2001, and presided over what was arguably the team's most successful period. The team ultimately reached the Stanley Cup finals in 2007 but lost to the Anaheim Ducks in a five-game series. Despite this success, the Senators announced that Muckler had been fired on June 18, 2007. Head coach Bryan Murray was promoted to replace him.\n\nMuckler was hired as a senior advisor with the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes in September 2008.\n"}

This game was based on Holistic's in-house role playing game \"Fading Suns\".\n\nThe game had a wide array of units and a complex back-story but was rushed to market and released with numerous severe flaws and several features underdeveloped. In patched form, it survives as a popular abandonware title with numerous unofficial, fan-made mods.\n\nThe game is played on a galactic map and specific planet maps. Planet maps use a hexa-grid system for movement. Individual units and buildings take up a single grid space. Several menus handle diplomacy, chat, and documentation. In the game, the player controls a feudal lord of a noble house amongst the ruins of a galactic empire. The player must battle other noble houses and rally enough support to be crowned Emperor of the galaxy. The player can start as one of five houses; each has its own advantages and disadvantages. During game setup, the player can customize their house, taking some negative traits such as insanity in exchange for more positive traits, like having all the player's units start out better trained. Each house starts on its respective home planet, and houses starting on temperate planets have an early-game advantage over houses that start on frozen or jungle planets. There are several non-player groups in the game, including the Symbiots, Vau, the Guild, and the Church. In total, there are forty-three planets that can be explored, colonized, and fought over.\n\n\"Next Generation\" rated it four stars out of five, and stated that \"With everything from basic combat to diplomatic backstabbing, \"Emperor of the Fading Suns\" has a depth of play that is worthy of a classic strategy game.\" \"Personal Computer Magazine\" described the game as \"destined to be a classic\" in their 1997 review, but also noted that the game suffered from bugs.\n\nAfter the end-of-support by the developer, the fan-community took over the support by creating player-made unofficial patches for the game. These try to fix bugs and/or enhance the game by adding new units and balancing out old ones (modding). For example, the \"Hyperion patch\" makes it possible for the Symbiots to build additional organic spaceships, so they are not stranded on their home planet if their initial fleet is destroyed.\n\n"}

The song was first performed in May, 2004 at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles during The Mars Volta's three-night residence closing the tour supporting their debut LP, \"De-Loused in the Comatorium\". At the concert, the song was dedicated to former Mars Volta member Jeremy Michael Ward, who had died of a drug overdose in May 2003. The song peaked at number 95 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100, making it the band's first and only single to chart there. The song also reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number 7 on the \"Billboard\" Alternative Songs chart. The single was also released on vinyl under the title \"Frances the Mute\".\n\nThe song appeared on an episode of \"Rescue Me\".\n\n\"The Widow\" is notably the only short, pop-structured song on \"Frances the Mute\", although the album-version features a lengthy, non-radio-friendly, atonal outro of organ and electronic spasms, taking up the later half of the track. The edit of \"The Widow\" cuts the last instrumental part of the regular album track and fades out when the vocals start to become distorted. It is also the only Mars Volta song to chart in the United States. The song is notable for its consistently high lead vocals which never go below the alto register. \n\nThe song features a brief trumpet part from Flea after the second chorus. Omar performs a brief solo in the same section. On the version of the single called \"Frances the Mute\", the studio version is replaced by a live recording of one of the first performances of the song at The Wiltern in 2004, and features only acoustic guitar and vocals, with some distortion effects.\nThe single also contains the 14-minute track \"Frances the Mute\", which was not included on the album of the same name. Many fans, based on comments by the band, consider this additional song as part of the \"Frances the Mute\" album and place it first in the running order, before \"Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus\".\n\n"}

Pershing Middle School is a middle school in Houston, Texas, United States. It is located in the Braeswood Place neighborhood, near the Texas Medical Center.\n\nThe school, that serves around 1,650 students in grades 6 through 8, is managed by the Houston Independent School District. Pershing has a neighborhood program and a Pre-AP Gifted and Talented program, and is a fine arts magnet school.\n\nWest University Place Pershing Junior High School, which was named after John J. Pershing, was established in 1928. Pershing originally was connected to West University Elementary School (which was located in the city of West University Place after the city incorporated in 1938); the school moved to its own campus at 7000 Braes Boulevard in Houston in 1949. The campus was worth $2 million. This relieved West University Elementary. It was funded by a 1944 bond, and the Braes Heights Realty Company had donated the land. University of Texas academics had suggested a different plan of action, but the decision to separate West University Elementary and Pershing into separate campuses was made by HISD superintendent W. E. Moreland, along with the business manager, H. L. Mills.\n\nAn arson incident occurred in August 1958.\n\nPershing was previously reserved for white children but it desegregated by 1970.\n\nIn September 1991 Pershing was one of 32 HISD schools that had capped enrollments; in other words the school was filled to capacity and excess students had to attend other schools. In 1992 there was a proposal to convert Gordon Elementary in Bellaire into a middle school to serve Bellaire residents. This proposal was favored by those zoned to Jane Long Middle School but it was opposed by those zoned to Pershing as they did not want to lose access to the school. The Gordon proposal ultimately did not happen.\n\nPershing had, in March 2002, a waiting list of 1,000 students for 120 places.\n\nOriginally, Houston ISD planned to remodel Pershing's 1949 campus. When HISD found that building a new campus from scratch would be more cost-effective, HISD decided to pursue that goal. Construction started on Pershing's brand new two-story campus at 3838 Bluebonnet (on the same site as the old campus) during the summer of 2005. Construction was expected to end in Summer 2007, and the new campus was originally expected to open in Fall 2007 . The lead architect for the campus was PGAL, with Gilbane as the lead project manager. The original budget was $16,900,000 United States dollars. The construction costs totaled $24.4 million, and the final costs, including books, computers, and architect engineers, totaled $31 million.\n\nThe previous campus had a capacity of 1,500 students; because enrollment was 1,700 as of fall 2004 Pershing had to cap enrollment of the 6th and 7th grades. The school district had to adjust its plans for Pershing's campus due to the unexpected surge in enrollment. The new building was built on the previous athletic fields, and the previous building was to close after the opening of the new one. After demolition of the previous building, the new athletic fields would go on its former site.\n\nThe new building opened on Thursday, January 18, 2007; originally the building was slated to open the previous day, but weather conditions lead to the temporary closing of all HISD schools for January 17.\n\nPortions of the former Pershing building remain because many chimney swift birds appeared in the chimney. The Migratory Bird Act makes the act of tearing down the Pershing chimney illegal.\n\nIn April 2014 two librarians at the school were informed that budget cuts would eliminate their positions. Michelle Leigh Smith of the \"Village News and Southwest News\" stated that \"parents believe many of HISD Superintendent Terry Grier's policies are tearing the district apart\" and that because principal Kim Heckman \"is considered one of Grier's rising stars\" therefore \"[s]ome believe Heckman is carrying out his agenda\" at Pershing.\n\nPershing, which is located in the Braeswood Place neighborhood, serves several areas of Houston that are in and out of the 610 Loop, including Braeswood Place, Linkwood, Knollwood Village, Woodshire, Woodside, Westridge, Southgate, Old Braeswood, Morningside Place, Westwood, Link Valley, a portion of Meyerland, a portion of Maplewood, and Sunset Terrace/Montclair. In addition to portions of Houston, Pershing also serves the cities of Bellaire, Southside Place, and West University Place.\n\nRice Village Apartments and Morningside Square, two Rice University graduate housing complexes that admit families, are zoned to this school.\n\nAround the early 1990s portions of the City of Bellaire west of the 610 Loop were zoned to Jane Long Middle School, while portions inside the 610 Loop were zoned to Pershing.\n\nIt is a fine arts magnet school, which specializes in music. The school clusters students into groups of 150. Each grade level has a number of clusters of students. One team of teachers is assigned to each cluster and this group of teachers is asked to know the students and their families. The racial demographics of each cluster are engineered to match that of the entire school. William G. Ouchi, author of \"Making Schools Work: A Revolutionary Plan to Get Your Children the Education They Need\", wrote that this \"achieves an intimate scale\" for the students.\n\nIn 2008, 93% of students passed state tests, with 84% of black students passing and 79% of Hispanic students passing. Seven years earlier, 67% of students passed state tests, with 47% of black students passing and 37% of Hispanic students passing.\n\nAs of 2010, teacher Charles Coursey requires students to do gardening before their instructional time and during afternoons. During class he allows students to eat portions of the vegetables that were harvested in the garden. On Saturdays the organizers sell the rest of the produce at the Rice University farmers' market. The proceeds go to purchasing supplies for the gardening program.\n\nTeams are known as the 'Pandas'. Sports teams include football, baseball, basketball, track and field, swimming, soccer, cross country, and lacrosse for boys and volleyball, cross country, swimming, basketball, track and field, lacrosse and softball for girls.\n\nAs of the 2013-14 school year Pershing educated 1,656 students, making it HISD's second largest middle school. During the 2011-12 school year, Pershing served 1,748 students.\n\nIn 2008 William G. Ouchi, author of \"Making Schools Work: A Revolutionary Plan to Get Your Children the Education They Need\", described Pershing as a racially and socioeconomically diverse school. That year, Pershing had a large number of immigrant students. As of 2008, of the 1,903 students at the school, 405 were in the fine arts program. There were 1,610 students that attended the school five years earlier. In 2008, there were 150 slots for new entrants into the magnet program and there were 1,100 applicants.\n\nMany students at Pershing move on to Bellaire High School and Lamar High School, two public high schools considered to be elite.\n\nElementary schools that feed into Pershing include:\n\nThe following elementary schools partially feed into Pershing:\n\nHigh schools which have attendance zones coinciding with Pershing include Bellaire, Lamar, Madison, Westbury, and Margaret Long Wisdom (formerly Robert E. Lee High School).

The station was owned by Shaw Communications under its cable systems unit, and was not part of the Shaw Media unit which was sold to Corus Entertainment in 2016. CJBN's studios were based alongside Shaw's local offices on 10th and Front Streets in Keewatin, and its transmitter was located near Norman Dam Road in Kenora. The station was carried on Shaw Cable channel 12, Bell TV channel 224 and Shaw Direct channel 320.\n\nIt was, with just 178 watts of power, the lowest-powered television station operating on a regular license in North America. This distinction was formerly tied with KJWY in Jackson, Wyoming (now WDPN-TV in Wilmington, Delaware/Philadelphia), until that station increased its power to 270 watts at the time of the digital television transition in the U.S. It was therefore the lowest-powered Canadian television station affiliated with a major network. Its main method of distribution was via sister company Shaw Cable, and other cable and satellite services.\n\nIn a letter to the CRTC on November 30, 2016, Shaw Communications announced it would not renew the station's license and intended to close the station on January 27, 2017.\n\nCJBN-TV first signed on the air in 1980, with a transmitter power output of 17.5 watts; the station was started by local businessmen Carl Johnson and Bertil Nilson. It was co-owned with Norcom Telecommunications, whose cable systems served Kenora and surrounding areas. With a potential audience of only 5,800 households, it was Canada's smallest television market. It remains the smallest designated market area in Canada, and the second smallest in North America (behind Glendive, Montana).\n\nThe station came about after Norcom applied to operate a Central Time Zone Satellite Relay Distribution System (SRDU), and as such, needed a CTV signal. Winnipeg's CKY-TV, which was the closest CTV affiliate to Kenora, was unavailable, so Norcom applied for, and was successful in gaining their own CTV station. The company also planned to set up a series of rebroadcasting stations to expand into nearby areas, but when Cancom secured the main licence for the Northern Service uplink, Norcom was left with just CJBN. With the local economy dependent on the pulp and paper industry, the station's future remained precarious, especially with the increase of competing satellite services available in the area.\n\nIn 1983, the station proposed setting up rebroadcast transmitters in nearby communities:\nIn 1985, CJBN-TV increased its power to 177.5 watts. In 1988, the station told the CRTC that they could not afford to construct the rebroadcast transmitters, and would remain with just one transmitter in Kenora. In place of the rebroadcast transmitters, the station was carried on cable in Red Lake, Sioux Lookout and Ear Falls, and later on, was added to the cable systems in most towns in Northwestern Ontario, including Dryden, Fort Frances, and Ignace.\n\nIn 1999, the station was brought before the CRTC to explain the lack of Canadian content, but two years later, its licence was renewed, once evidence of renewed effort toward Canadian content was proven. In 2000, CJBN started to brand itself as \"CJTV\", but would revert to the CJBN-TV designation after its purchase by Shaw Communications. And in 2004, cable systems in nearby areas and national satellite services began to carry CJBN.\n\nOn August 9, 2006, Shaw Communications announced an agreement to purchase Norcom, including CJBN. As Shaw itself did not previously own any broadcast assets, there was some speculation that the struggling CJBN would be resold to CTV to become a repeater of CKY-TV (Shaw had itself sold CKY to CTV following a similar acquisition in 2001). However, the company decided to keep CJBN. CRTC approval of the sale was announced in November 2006.\n\nShaw Cable-tv Winnipeg announced in April 2007 that it would add CJBN to the digital signals offered to Winnipeg subscribers and placed CJBN on ch. 68.\n\nShaw Communications acquired Canwest's broadcasting assets, including the Global Television Network, in 2010. In response to deficiency questions from the CRTC regarding its application to acquire those assets, made public in July 2010, Shaw stated that it had no plans to disaffiliate CJBN from CTV and make the Kenora station a full Global O&O. The cable provider said it would negotiate to extend CJBN's affiliation agreement with CTV, which was set to expire on August 31, 2010, at the time. However, on December 1, 2011, CJBN dropped all CTV programming and became a full Global station, adopting a schedule similar to nearby Global station CKND-DT in Winnipeg. As a result of the switch, CJBN became a \"de facto\" Global owned-and-operated station, even as it was the only Shaw-owned television station that was owned by the company outright rather than Shaw Media, but the station did not call itself \"Global Kenora\" under the branding conventions of the network's other O&O stations, identifying instead by its callsign (in the manner of privately owned Canadian television stations).\n\nKenora cable subscribers, both analog and digital, continue to have access to CTV programming through CKY-DT, which was carried on Shaw's basic cable service in Kenora and area on CJBN's previous cable channel positions (including channel 4 in Kenora), with CJBN relocated to cable 12, the channel position previously used by CKND.\n\nCJBN was not included in the 2016 sale of Shaw Media (including the Global network and most of its stations) to Corus Entertainment. It remained under Shaw Communications ownership and was therefore technically a Global affiliate, but remained a \"de facto\" O&O insofar as both Shaw Communications and Corus are controlled by the family of JR Shaw.\n\nOn November 30, 2016, Shaw announced the closure of the station, citing duplication with CKND. In a letter filed to the CRTC, Shaw stated that it was in the process of notifying the affected parties of the closure. The company also said that CJBN's two locally produced programs, \"Fishing with Gussy\" and \"Good Morning Sunset Country\", will continue to air locally on Shaw TV Kenora. Three jobs have been affected by the closure, which occurred on January 27, 2017.\n\nAs of its closure, the station carried a similar schedule to CKND-DT, the Global-owned station in Winnipeg, including its local newscasts, with the exception of CJBN airing shows such as local production \"The Weekend Adventurer\" and \"Urban Rush\". The station was examined by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in 1999 for not airing enough Canadian content. Since this occurred, the station aired the required amount of Canadian programming.\n\nFrom the station's launch until its disaffiliation from CTV in 2011, the station's programming was primarily sourced from CTV, with the remainder of the schedule rounded out by Global and syndicated programming, although the exact balance varied from season to season. As with many smaller independently owned Canadian stations, there were also several infomercials throughout any given day's schedule.\n\nDespite being the only full-fledged station in the area, CJBN never produced much local content. A full-fledged news department was not considered feasible for the station due to the market's small population. Instead, the stations simulcast most local news programs produced by Global-owned Winnipeg sister station CKND-DT (with the exception of that station's weekend 6 p.m. newscast). For many years, the station's only newscasts were two-minute segments, which were combined into a review program at the end of the week.\n\nIn 2008, CJBN began airing a news and issues show called \"Points North\" which aired eight times per week: Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings at 6:30 and 11:30 p.m., and weekend evenings at 6:30 p.m. It also aired other special programs aimed at tourists and local residents. In late 2011, \"Points North\" became a lifestyles show and its airtime was cut back to weekend evenings at 6:30 p.m. The show was later cancelled in February 2013 to make way for \"The Weekend Adventurer\", which launched in April 2013.\n\nCJBN also aired a half-hour regional news program, \"Northwest Newsweek\", which was produced in Thunder Bay by Thunder Bay Television. CNN anchor Ashleigh Banfield began her career at the station.\n\nOn May 20, 2016, CJBN aired its final 2-minute news update. This update was used to announce a new local morning program that began airing on CJBN on June 3, 2016, called \"Good Morning Sunset Country\".

Upon the starting signal, the riders accelerate down a long, two lane, straight paved track where their elapsed time and terminal speed are recorded. The rider to reach the finish line first is the winner. The best-known form of motorcycle drag racing is the Pro Stock Bike category, although several other categories exist, including nitromethane engine.\n\nMotorcycles in the Top Fuel category are fueled by nitro methane and can make nearly 1,500 horsepower. From a standing start they can cover the first 60 feet in less than a second and can reach 200 mph in less than eighth-mile or 660 feet.\nThe current world record is held by Peter Svensson of Sweden who covered the quarter-mile in 5.709 seconds on August 24, 2012 at his home track of Tierp Arena.\n\nThe North American record is held by Top Fuel Veteran Larry \"Spiderman\" McBride at 5.74, recorded at South Georgia Motorsports Park in November 2008.\n\nElmer Trett is considered by many to be the greatest motorcycle drag racer ever.

{"id": "1922779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922779", "title": "The Social Contract", "text": "The Social Contract\n\nThe Social Contract, originally published as On the Social Contract; or, Principles of Political Rights () by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, is a 1762 book in which Rousseau theorized about the best way to establish a political community in the face of the problems of commercial society, which he had already identified in his \"Discourse on Inequality\" (1755).\n\n\"The Social Contract\" helped inspire political reforms or revolutions in Europe, especially in France. \"The Social Contract\" argued against the idea that monarchs were divinely empowered to legislate. Rousseau asserts that only the people, who are sovereign, have that all-powerful right.\n\nThe epigraph of the work is \"foederis aequas / Dicamus leges\" (Virgil, \"Aeneid\" XI.321–22). The stated aim of \"The Social Contract\" is to determine whether there can be a legitimate political authority, since people's interactions he saw at his time seemed to put them in a state far worse than the good one they were at in the state of nature, even though living in isolation. He concludes book one, chapter three with, \"Let us then admit that force does not create right, and that we are obliged to obey only legitimate powers\", which is to say, the ability to coerce is not a legitimate power, and there is no rightful duty to submit to it. A state has no right to enslave a conquered people.\n\nIn this desired social contract, everyone will be free because they all forfeit the same number of rights and impose the same duties on all. Rousseau argues that it is absurd for a man to surrender his freedom for slavery; thus, the participants must have a right to choose the laws under which they live. Although the contract imposes new laws, including those safeguarding and regulating property, there are restrictions on how that property can be legitimately claimed. His example with land includes three conditions; that the land be uninhabited, that the owner claims only what is needed for subsistence, and that labour and cultivation give the possession legitimacy.\n\nRousseau posits that the political aspects of a society should be divided into two parts. First, there must be a sovereign consisting of the whole population, women included, that represents the general will and is the legislative power within the state. The second division is that of the government, being distinct from the sovereign. This division is necessary because the sovereign cannot deal with particular matters like applications of the law. Doing so would undermine its generality, and therefore damage its legitimacy. Thus, the government must remain a separate institution from the sovereign body. When the government exceeds the boundaries set in place by the people, it is the mission of the people to abolish such government, and begin anew.\n\nRousseau claims that the size of the territory to be governed often decides the nature of the government. Since a government is only as strong as the people, and this strength is absolute, the larger the territory, the more strength the government must be able to exert over the populace. In his view, a monarchical government is able to wield the most power over the people since it has to devote less power to itself, while a democracy the least. In general, the larger the bureaucracy, the more power required for government discipline. Normally, this relationship requires the state to be an aristocracy or monarchy. When Rousseau uses the word democracy, he refers to a direct democracy rather than a representative democracy. In light of the relation between population size and governmental structure, Rousseau argues that like his native Geneva, small city-states are the form of nation in which freedom can best flourish. For states of this size, an elected aristocracy is preferable, and in very large states a benevolent monarch; but even monarchical rule, to be legitimate, must be subordinate to the sovereign rule of law.\n\nThe French philosopher Voltaire used his publications to criticise and mock Rousseau, but also to defend free expression. In his \"Idées républicaines\" (1765), he reacted to the news that \"The Social Contract\" had been burned in Geneva, saying \"The operation of burning it was perhaps as odious as that of writing it. […] To burn a book of argument is to say: 'We do not have enough wit to reply to it.'\" The work was also banned in Paris.\n\nThe work received a refutation called \"The Confusion of the Social Contract by Jean-Jacques Rousseau\" by the Jesuit Alfonso Muzzarelli in Italy in 1794.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1922784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922784", "title": "Johnny Vander Meer", "text": "Johnny Vander Meer\n\nJohn Samuel Vander Meer (November 2, 1914 – October 6, 1997) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher, most notably for the Cincinnati Reds. Vander Meer is most notable for being the only pitcher in Major League Baseball history to throw two consecutive no-hitters. After the impressive start to his major league career, he experienced problems controlling the accuracy of his pitching, and his later career was marked by inconsistent performances.\n\nBorn in Prospect Park, New Jersey, he moved with his family to Midland Park, New Jersey in 1918. He had an inauspicious start to his professional baseball career. He was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as an amateur free agent in 1933 and assigned to the Dayton Ducks. Dayton then sold his contract to a Boston Bees minor league affiliate, the Scranton Miners of the New York–Pennsylvania League. The Miners found his playing ability to be lacking and sent him to the Cincinnati Reds affiliate, the Nashville Volunteers, in a trade for Tiny Chaplin. From Nashville, he was sent to the Durham Bulls, where the Bulls manager and catcher, Johnny Gooch, was credited with helping control the wildness of Vander Meer's pitching. In 1936, he posted a record of 19 wins against six losses for Durham.\nVander Meer made his major league debut with the Cincinnati Reds on April 22, 1937 at the age of 22. He went 3–4 before being sent back to the minor leagues with the Syracuse Chiefs for most of the season when the Reds recalled him in September. The following year on June 11, 1938, Vander Meer pitched a no-hitter against the Boston Bees. Four days later against the Brooklyn Dodgers in what was the first night game ever held at Ebbets Field, he threw another no-hitter, becoming the only player in major league history to throw two straight no-hitters, a historic record that has never been tied and almost certainly will never be beaten.\n\nVander Meer's performance earned him the role as the starting pitcher for the National League team in the 1938 All-Star game held at Cincinnati's Crosley Field. The American League team – having won four of the previous five All-Star games – was favored to win the game, but Vander Meer pitched three scoreless innings and allowed only one hit, as the National League went on to win 4–1. He ended the season with a 15–10 record and a 3.12 earned run average for the fourth place Reds. He might have won more games, but spent nearly a month in the hospital being treated for boils late in the season.\n\nAfter his impressive rookie season, Vander Meer had a disappointing 1939 season, when he fell ill during spring training, and then suffered an injury when he slipped on a wet pitching mound in Pittsburgh. He posted a 5–9 record and an earned run average of 4.67. Early in the 1940 season, he began to experience problems controlling the accuracy of his pitches. In June, the Reds released him back to the minor leagues where he played for the Indianapolis Indians and went 6–4. He returned to the major leagues in September and posted a 3–1 record, including a 12-inning victory against Philadelphia on September 18, that clinched the National League pennant for the Reds. In the 13th inning, Vander Meer hit a double, advanced to third base on a sacrifice fly, then scored the winning run on a squeeze bunt. In the 1940 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, Vander Meer made only one appearance when he entered Game 5 in the fifth inning with the Reds trailing 7–0. He pitched three scoreless innings as the Reds lost 8–0. The Reds went on to win the series in seven games. It would be the only post-season appearance of Vander Meer's career.\n\nIn 1941, Vander Meer's performance improved somewhat with a 16–12 record and six shutouts while leading the league with 202 strikeouts. On June 6, 1941 in a game against Philadelphia, he allowed only one hit. Vander Meer later recalled that the only hit in the game could have been ruled an error, as shortstop Eddie Joost fielded the ground ball, then dropped it before throwing to first base. He earned his third All-Star selection in the 1942 All-Star Game, and once again threw three scoreless innings in a 3–1 loss to the American League. He finished the 1942 season with a career-high 18 wins against 12 losses and once again led the league in strikeouts. He posted a 15–16 record in 1943 for the second place Reds and led the league in strikeouts for a third consecutive year. On March 3, 1944, Vander Meer joined the United States Navy and was stationed at Sampson Naval Training Station in New York where he would play for the Navy baseball team. He was discharged from the Navy in December 1945, having lost two years of his major league career to his military service, but Vander Meer claimed that his extensive military play made him less wild as a pitcher, which his record partially supports.\n\nThe 31-year-old pitcher returned to play for the Reds in 1946 although he was not able to recapture his previous form. He produced one more notable season in 1948 when he went 17–14, before his contract was sold to the Chicago Cubs in February 1950. After an ineffective year with the Cubs, he was released in March 1951 and was signed as a free agent by the Cleveland Indians. He appeared in only one game for the Indians on May 7, 1951 before being released on June 30, 1951 at the age of 36. Vander Meer was an incidental witness when his Cincinnati teammate Ewell Blackwell almost duplicated his consecutive no-hit feat in 1947, by pitching a no-hitter against the Braves, then in his next appearance held the Dodgers without a hit until the ninth inning when he gave up two hits.\n\nVander Meer returned to the minor leagues where he played for five more seasons until the age of 40. In 1952, 14 years after his consecutive no-hitters, Vander Meer pitched a no-hitter for the Tulsa Oilers against the Beaumont Roughnecks in the Texas League.\n\nA four-time All-Star, Vander Meer compiled a 119–121 record with 1,294 strikeouts and a 3.44 ERA in 2,104⅔ innings over a 13-year Major League career. He had 29 career shutouts, ranking third on the Reds franchise list. His 1,251 strikeouts with the Reds were the team record at the time of his retirement in 1951. Along with Tim Lincecum (2008–10), Randy Johnson (1999–2002), and Warren Spahn (1949–52), Vander Meer is one of only four NL pitchers since 1940 to lead the league in strikeouts in three straight seasons (1941–43). Just those four and Dizzy Dean (1932–35) have done it since 1931. \n\nAfter retiring as a player at the age of 40, Vander Meer became a minor league manager in the Cincinnati Reds organization for ten seasons before retiring in 1962. After his retirement from baseball, he worked for a brewing company. He was inducted as part of the inaugural class into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1958. He died of an abdominal aneurysm at his home in Tampa, Florida, on October 6, 1997 at the age of 82.\n"}

In October 1968, after being drafted by the Denver Broncos of the American Football League (AFL), he became the first starting black quarterback in professional American football and established a Denver rookie record of 14 touchdown passes that season. He played professionally for nine years.\n\nFrom Omaha, Nebraska, Briscoe played high school football at Omaha South High School and college football at Omaha University, now known as the University of Nebraska at Omaha.\n\nBriscoe was 5-foot-10 and 177 pounds when the AFL's Broncos took him in the 14th round of the 1968 draft at the age of 22. The Broncos intended to convert Briscoe to cornerback, but Briscoe had negotiated for a chance to compete for the quarterback position.\n\nOn September 29, 1968, starter Steve Tensi suffered a broken collarbone, and backup Joe DiVito was spotty. Head coach Lou Saban summoned Briscoe from the sidelines in the fourth quarter against the Boston Patriots to give him a try. Briscoe's first play was a 22-yard completion. On his second series he orchestrated an 80-yard touchdown drive. He completed a 21-yard pass and ran for 38 more himself, carrying it the last 12 yards for the score.\n\nA week later, on October 6, he became the first starting African-American quarterback in the AFL. Briscoe threw 14 touchdown passes that year in just 5 starts, including 4 on Nov 24 against Buffalo; both are still Broncos rookie records. He also threw for 335 yards in that game, a rookie record that stood until John Elway broke it in 1983, and one of only three 300+ yard rookie games in franchise history. He completed 41.5 percent of his passes, and averaged 7.1 yards per attempt and his 17.1 yards per completion led the American Football League (and ranks 18th all-time). He also ran for 308 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nBefore the 1969 season started, Briscoe still determined to play quarterback, discovered that head coach Saban intended to use Pete Liske as the starter, so he asked to be released. He went to the AFL's Buffalo Bills where he was turned into a receiver, since the Bills already had superstar Jack Kemp, former Pro Bowler Tom Flores, and James Harris, another black quarterback with a more prototypical 6-foot-4 and 210-pound frame. Briscoe never played quarterback again, but he enjoyed a splendid career. He led Buffalo in touchdown catches in each of his three seasons there and in receptions twice. In 1970 he was in the top two in receptions and receiving yards and became an All-Pro.\n\nAfter the AFL-NFL merger, he played in the National Football League from 1970 though 1976, mostly with American Football Conference teams. In 1971, the Bills traded Briscoe to the Miami Dolphins for a first-round draft pick Joe Delamielleure, who developed as a Hall of Fame guard.\n\nBriscoe went on to win a pair of Super Bowls. Briscoe led the undefeated 1972 team with four touchdown receptions and was the leading receiver on the Dolphins in 1973, catching more passes than future Pro Football Hall of Famer, Paul Warfield.\n\nBriscoe made stops with the San Diego Chargers, and Detroit Lions before ending his career in 1976 with the New England Patriots. He had 10 receptions for 136 yards and 1 touchdown in 14 regular season games for the New England Patriots in 1976. He caught a 16-yard touchdown pass from Steve Grogan in the Patriots 48-17 rout of the Oakland Raiders at Schaefer Stadium on October 3, 1976. Early in his career, Briscoe was intercepted by Boston Patriots AFL All Star Defensive Back Leroy Mitchell in Denver's 35-14 rout of the Patriots at Fenway Park on November 3, 1968. He is the only player to have been intercepted by a Patriot player and later to have caught a touchdown as a Patriot receiver.\n\nUpon retirement from professional sports, Briscoe moved to Los Angeles. He became established as a successful financial broker, dealing in municipal bonds. Briscoe was affected by the 1980s cocaine epidemic, becoming addicted, but recovered after extensive rehab. In the 21st century, he worked as the director of the Boys and Girls Club in Long Beach, California before retiring. He founded a football camp for children.\n\nA biopic film titled \"The Magician\", based on Briscoe's life, has been under development for several years. Canadian actor Lyriq Bent has been approached to portray Briscoe in the film. In 2016, the University of Nebraska Omaha, Briscoe's alma mater, honored him by unveiling a statue.\n\n\n"}

That same year, they self-released their debut album Tormented. Soon after that, the band received a concert slot through Aaron Lewis' cousin Justin Cantor with Limp Bizkit. Shortly before the performance, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst confronted the band about their album's graphic cover art, and accused them of being satan worshippers. But, Durst ended up being impressed by Staind's performance.\n\nFollowing that, Staind released the albums Dysfunction in 1999, Break the Cycle in 2001, 14 Shades of Grey in 2003, Chapter V in 2005, in 2006, The Illusion of Progress in 2008, and their self-titled album in 2011 before going on hiatus in 2012.

It is the first all-stone, white granite temple to be built in the western hemisphere whose construction began in 1990. The Iraivan Temple is located next to the Wailua River and 8 km from Mount Waialeale. It is maintained by the Saiva Siddhanta Church which is also known as Kauai Aadheenam and Kauai's Hindu Monastery. The temple is under construction. Spatika (Crystal) Lingam will be housed in it after its construction completes, till then crystal Lingam is placed in the Kadavul temple.The centerpiece of the temple will be a 700-pound, 39-inch-tall, uncut quartz crystal, believed to be the largest six-sided, single-pointed crystal ever found \n\nSri Trichy Mahaswamigal (d. 2005) of Kailash Ashram, Bangalore, describes the temple's importance: \"The Iraivan Temple is going to be to America what the temples of Chidambaram, Madurai, Rameshwaram, and other great Siva temples are to India.\"\n\nIraivan Temple was inspired by a vision of Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, on February 15, 1975, in which he saw Lord Shiva walking on the land where the temple is now located. It is intended as a place of pilgrimage for Hindus worldwide. Subramuniyaswami set three parameters for its design and construction:\nThe temple design was completed by V. Ganapati Sthapati in the late 1980s. Carving of the 4,000-plus blocks of granite commenced in 1990 at a worksite in Bangalore, India and then transported to temple site at Kauai. Beginning in 2001, the stone were shipped to Kauai and assembly begun by a team of silpi temple carvers under the direction of a master architect or \"sthapati\". The 3.2 million pound temple is expected to be completed in a few years. Two Indian swamis: Sri Sivaratnapuri Mahaswamigal (popularly known as Tiruchi Swami) and Sri Balagangadharanatha are assistting with the project and in 1990 provided eleven acres of land outside Bangalore.\n\nThe temple is a Chola-Style temple and possesses a number of rare architectural features. The first is that it is being carved entirely by hand. Craftsmen follow and preserve traditional methods, shaping the stone with small hammers and utilizing over 70 types of chisels. The second feature is the foundation is made of a crack-free, 7,000-psi formula using \"fly ash,\" a by-product of coal burning. Fly ash consists of inorganic, incombustible matter present in the coal that has been fused during combustion into a glassy structure. The foundation was designed by Dr. Kumar Mehta, a materials scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, and was the first project to demonstrate his theories on the use of fly ash in concrete. The third set of features are exhibitions of the stone carver's craft. The foremost of these are two sets of \"musical pillars\" whose tall rods are designed to resonate precise musical tones when struck with a mallet. Others include six stone lions carved into the pillars each of which contains a stone ball freely rotatable in its mouth but not removable, a large stone bell, and stone chains with loose links.\n\nThe temple is facing south and built according to vastu science. Vastu architecture aims at creating a space that will elevate the vibration of the individual to resonate with the vibration of the built space, which in turn is in tune with universal space. The whole space of the temple is defined in multiples and fractions of one unit, and 7 inches. Pillars through the temple are spaced and structured to serve as energy points for the building. Iraivan Temple will be completely free of electricity for mystical reasons, as decreed by Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami.\n\nThe main murti, or worshipful icon, is a rare \"spathika Sivalinga,\" a pointed, six-faced 700-pound clear quartz crystal. In the early 1980s, Subramuniyaswami had been seeing the crystal in his dreams. He found it in 1987 and brought it to Kauai. The stone, estimated to be 50 million years old, was not cut out of rock by a miner. Instead, it was found in a perfect state encased in mud, probably harvested from its original outcropping by an earthquake.\n\nThe quartz crystal (sphatika) of the Sivalinga is considered specially sacred because it represents the element akasha.\n\nThe construction of the main pavilion is complete, and a few other ancillary structures are being worked on. The temple is expected to be inaugurated with a maha kumbha abhishekam in a few years.\n\nThe current head of the project is Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami, leader of the monastery and successor to the founder.\n\n"}

The page may be automatically refreshed after a certain interval, or polled dynamically in order to keep new messages visible. Older posts are often deleted after a certain number of messages have been written in order to preserve space on the server.\n\nShoutboxes are embedded into a page with inline frames or JavaScript. Many Internet forum and web blog software packages can be modified to add shoutboxes in sidebars on site pages. Shoutboxes are usually maintained in a manner similar to that of more complex boards, with moderators that can delete posts and ban usernames or IP addresses. Occasionally, features such as impostor identification, flood control, and profanity filters may be included.\n\nLike most dynamic content, shoutboxes typically interface with a database, and some may query the database every time a page is requested. Unlike most dynamic content, however, shoutboxes are generally placed on every page of a web site, so they tend to cause disproportionate strain on databases. Therefore, care must be taken to ensure that shoutboxes do not use too many database resources. Caching systems like memcached can be used to mitigate this to some extent, or an alternative implementation such as storing all messages in system-wide shared memory rather than a database may be used.

Each species is adapted to the specific environment which it inhabits, but all species of the genus share certain anatomical and metabolic traits, reflecting their common evolutionary ancestry.\n\nPachypodium species vary widely in general form, or habit. The genus contains species ranging from the bottle-shaped Pachypodium baronii to the cigar-like Pachypodium lamerei to the branchless dwarf species Pachypodium brevicaule. Most species, however, are shrub or tree-like, ranging in height from 5 m or less to as much as 12 m. All species save one have spines on their branchlets, which are a modified form of stipule; some species have spines in other locations as well. In African species, the spines are clustered in groups of three, two large spines and one small one in the middle. In other species, the spines come in groups of two. The length of the spines varies from 1 to 75 mm.\n\nThe wood of Pachypodium species is soft and cream-colored; their bark is, on average, 6 mm thick, and often smooth. It ranges in color from dark brown to pale grey to green-grey. In cross section, it is usually green in color.\n\nThe leaves may be either sessile—growing directly from the stem—or petiolate—growing from a leaf-stalk. They are typically confined to the apices of branchlets, branches, or the trunk. In most species, leaves range from slightly hairy to smooth on top and densely hairy to smooth beneath. Leaf shape varies, but, in all but one species, upcurving secondary veins are apparent.\n\nPachypodium inflorescence, or clusters of flowers, appear either at the end of the stem, growing directly off the stem, or attached to the stem by branchlets. The bracts, or leaves surrounding the inflorescence, resemble sepals. Flower stalks range in length from 0 to 56 mm.\n\nPachypodium flowers always consist of five sepals, ranging in shape from ovate to oblong. The flower is tubular, sometimes narrowing at the top, and varies in color; various shades off red, white, and yellow appear in different species. A hairy belt of varying width appears above the stamens. The tube of the flower varies in length from 9 to 60 mm across the genus. The ovary of the flower is composed of two carpels, each containing numerous ovules. All but two species in the genus have stamens within the flower. When pollinated, the flower produces a pale to dark brown fruit composed of two separate mericaps, which is whitish to pale brown inside when dried. The seeds are pale to medium brown, with a lighter spot on their apex.\n\nAll pachypodium species share certain basic characteristics; they use enlarged, spine protected trunks for water storage, enabling them to inhabit dry microenvironments. There is, however, substantial variation on these basic characteristics, and no single shape or pattern of branching is shared by the entire genus. In general, branching is flexible even within a species, allowing each individual specimen to develop as best suits its microenvironment. This adaptability allows pachpyodium plants to occupy marginal microenvironments which provide only limited means of survival.\n\n"}
{"id": "1922808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922808", "title": "Brilliant Blue FCF", "text": "Brilliant Blue FCF\n\nBrilliant Blue FCF (Blue 1) is a synthetic organic compound used primarily as a blue colorant for processed foods, medications, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. It is classified as a triarylmethane dye and is known under various names, such as FD&C Blue No. 1 or Acid Blue 9. It is denoted by E number E133 and has a color index of 42090. It has the appearance of a blue powder and is soluble in water and glycerol, with a maximum absorption at about 628 nanometers. It is one of the oldest FDA-approved color additives and is generally considered nontoxic and safe.\n\nBrilliant Blue FCF is synthetic dye produced by the condensation of 2-formylbenzenesulfonic acid and the appropriate aniline followed by oxidation. It can be combined with tartrazine (E102) to produce various shades of green.\n\nIt is usually a disodium salt. The diammonium salt has CAS number . Calcium and potassium salts are also permitted. It can also appear as an aluminum lake. The chemical formation is CHNNaOS.\n\nRelated dyes are C.I. acid green 3 (CAS#4680-78-8) and acid green 9 (CAS#4857-81-2). In these dyes, the 2-sulfonic acid group is replaced by H and Cl, respectively.\n\nMany attempts have been made to find similarly colored natural dyes that are as stable as Brilliant Blue FCF. Blue pigments must possess many chemical traits, including pi-bond conjugation, aromatic rings, heteroatoms and heteroatom groups, and ionic charges in order to absorb low energy red light. Most natural blue dyes are either unstable, blue only in alkaline conditions, or toxic; good candidates for further research into use as natural dyes include anthocyanin and trichotomine derivatives. No replacement for Brilliant Blue FCF has been found for use in beverages.\n\nLike many other color additives, the primary use of Blue No. 1 is to correct or enhance natural coloring or to give colorless compounds a vivid hue.\n\nIn the United States, of the two approved blue dyes (the other being Indigo carmine, or FD&C Blue #2), Brilliant Blue FCF is the more common of the two. As a blue color, Brilliant Blue FCF is often found in cotton candy, ice cream, canned processed peas, packet soups, bottled food colorings, icings, ice pops, blueberry flavored products, children's medications, dairy products, sweets soft drinks, and drinks, especially the liqueur Blue Curaçao. It is also used in soaps, shampoos, mouthwash and other hygiene and cosmetics applications.\n\nBrilliant Blue FCF is extensively used as a water tracer agent. Due to its ability to retain color for long periods of time, Brilliant Blue FCF outperforms other dye tracers. Additionally, Brilliant Blue FCF has a low toxicity level that is favorable for the environment. However, Brilliant Blue FCF has different impacts on varying soils. Brilliant Blue FCF is attracted to and sorbed in acidic soils due to its large size and ionic charge. Soil composition and flow velocity also effect the level of sorption of Brilliant Blue FCF.\n\nBrilliant Blue FCF dye within beverages items—such as soda—can be used in the blue bottle experiment. In such foods, both the dye and reducing agents are incorporated in the same solution. When the solution is blue, oxygen is present. On the addition of NaOH, a reaction occurs that removes the oxygen, turning the solution clear. The dye turns back to blue once it is reoxidized by swirling the solution, incorporating oxygen from the air as an oxidizing agent.\n\nThe dye is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and 95% of the ingested dye can be found in the feces.\n\nWhen applied to the tongue or shaved skin, Brilliant Blue FCF can be absorbed directly into the bloodstream.\n\nDue to its nontoxic properties, Brilliant Blue FCF has been used as a biological stain. When dissolved in an acidic medium, this dye has been used to stain cell walls, bacteria, and fungal cells. The dye does not inhibit the growth of any of these species.\n\nFor similar reasons, Brilliant Blue FCF is also being utilized in hemostatic medical devices, most notably the HEMOPATCH—designed to be placed on bleeding tissues and coagulate the blood. A low concentration of Brilliant Blue FCF is placed on the backside of the HEMOPATCH at 1 cm increments, allowing surgeons to cut precisely and indicate the side of the HEMOPATCH that is an active hemostatic agent for correct placement.\n\nBrilliant Blue FCF is an approved food colorant and pharmacologically inactive substance for drug formulations in the EU and the United States. It is also legal in other countries. It has the capacity for inducing allergic reactions in individuals with pre-existing moderate asthma. In 2003, the U.S. FDA issued a public health advisory to warn health care providers of the potential toxicity of this synthetic dye in enteral feeding solutions.\nThe following legal limits apply in the EU (E 131) and other countries: 150–300 mg/kg depending on the type of food. Safety limit for foods and drugs: 0.1 mg/day per kg body weight.\nThe ADI for Brilliant Blue FCF is 6 mg/kg.\n\nBrilliant Blue FCF and similar dyes such as Brilliant Blue G are inhibitors to purinergic receptors—receptors that are responsible for inflammatory responses and other cell process.\n\nScientists who were conducting \"in-vivo\" studies of compounds to lessen the severity of inflammation following experimental spinal cord injury had previously tested a compound called OxATP to block a key ATP receptor in spinal neurons. However, OxATP has toxic side effects and must be injected directly into the spinal cord; in searching for alternatives they noted that Brilliant Blue FCF has a similar structure. This led them to test a related dye, Brilliant Blue G (also known as Coomassie Brilliant Blue) in rats, which improved recovery from spinal cord injury while temporarily turning them blue.\n\nWhen human washed platelets are evaluated using turbidimetry it was found that Brilliant Blue FCF affects platelet aggregation by blocking the Panx1 channels. These inhibitory effects on collagen-induced shape change and maximal aggregation were shown by high (1 mM) concentrations of the dye but not by lower concentrations (100 μM). The 1 mM effective concentration is 1.59 times greater than the approximately 0.63 mM maximal allowable Brilliant Blue FCF concentration according to the European Food Safety Authority.\n\nScientists are performing studies to better understand the effects of Brilliant Blue FCF during vein graft explantation. Brilliant Blue FCF hinders the purinergic receptors, limiting cell proliferation that may lead to intimal hyperplasia. The effects of Brilliant Blue FCF were tested on rat aortic cells. It was found that Brilliant Blue FCF had a positive impact in limiting the development of intimal hyperplasia following a vein graft procedure.\n\n\n"}

Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, Hilary Duff, Piper Perabo, Alyson Stoner, and Tom Welling reprise their roles as members of the 12-child Baker family. Eugene Levy co-stars as the patriarch of a rival family of eight children. Carmen Electra portrays his wife.\n\nTwo years after Tom Baker resigned from his head coaching position, his family begins to undergo many changes, beginning with his daughter Lorraine's internship with Allure magazine in New York City. The Bakers’ oldest daughter, Nora, is now married to Bud McNulty and pregnant with their first child; Bud and Nora intend to move to Houston because of Bud's new job.\n\nFeeling the family is breaking apart as the children grow up and move away, Tom persuades them to take one last family vacation all together at Lake Winnetka, a fictional lake in Wisconsin. The family finds that their old cabin is currently owned by a man named Mike Romanow. Tom's old rival, Jimmy Murtaugh, his new wife Sarina, and their large family (with \"only\" eight kids) are also vacationing at the lake for the summer; Jimmy is also friends and neighbors with Mike Romanow. Jimmy constantly flaunts his wealth and success to Tom, as well as the accomplishments of his children, often suggesting to Tom that his are less successful because of his parenting style. They get into many incidents, several of which are accidental: Mark Baker, along with Kenny Murtaugh, crashes into a tennis court with a golf cart, Sarah Baker is caught stealing makeup from a gift shop, and Mark accidentally sets off a backpack of fireworks, causing widespread panic, especially when it is thrown into a boat, igniting its engine and causing it to explode.\n\nJimmy again brings up the topic that Tom needs to be more strict with his kids. Tom is angered by this, and he and Jimmy decide to settle the matter at the Annual Labor Day Family Cup. Tom trains the kids for days, not realizing they are miserable. Sarah and Elliot Murtaugh watch \"Ice Age\" together, but are spied on by their fathers, which ultimately results in them getting into an argument and humiliating their children. Upon returning to the Bakers’ cabin, Sarah is furious and refuses to compete for Tom in the Cup. The children are angry with him, not only for spying on Sarah, but also for ruining the entire trip because of his competitiveness with the Murtaughs, and Tom's wife Kate laments that the two pulling with their parenting has only torn the entire family further apart.\n\nThe next morning, Tom goes to the Cup to compete with Nigel and Kyle, the only two still willing to go. However, after discovering an old \"Team Baker\" flag, Kate and the rest of the kids show up, showing they forgive him and are willing to compete. After the events, however, the Bakers and the Murtaughs are tied for first; a tiebreaking canoe race is announced, in which every family member must compete. During the canoe race, Nora goes into labor; the Murtaughs want to help, but Jimmy, sensing the opportunity to defeat Tom once and for all, refuses to do so. The Murtaugh children jump out of the canoe to help the Bakers. While arguing with Sarina, Jimmy reveals he was jealous of Tom being the popular one when they were younger. Eventually, Sarina convinces him to help and the two families work together to get Nora to the hospital. Bud, Lorraine, and Kate go with Nora in the delivery room, while Tom, Jimmy, Sarina, and the rest of the kids stay in the waiting room. While talking with Jimmy, Tom realizes that he has to let his kids grow, but wherever they go, they will always be with him, and he will always be with them. Nora then gives birth to a baby boy whom she and Bud name Tom in honor of his grandfather, who has shown them that \"there is no way to be a perfect parent, but a million ways to be a really good one.\" Bud announces that he and Nora have bought \"The Big House\", the vacation home that the Bakers had been renting. Nora, Bud, and baby Tom leave for Houston a few days later.\n\n\n\n\n\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes ranked \"Cheaper by the Dozen 2\" 98th in the 100 worst reviewed films of the 2000s. It has a rating of 6% based on 93 reviews of the film. The site's consensus reads: \"A sequel to a remake, \"Cheaper 2\" wastes its solid cast in scenes of over-the-top, predictable humor\". On Metacritic, it has a score of 34 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\n\"Chicago Sun-Times\" critic Roger Ebert, gave the film one of its rare positive reviews, awarding it 3/4 stars and stating \"As I watched this sequel, a certain good feeling began to make itself known. Yes, the movie is unnecessary. However, it is unnecessary at a higher level of warmth and humor than the recent remake \"Yours, Mine, and Ours\".\" Ebert also highly praised Alyson Stoner's performance, favorably comparing the then-twelve year old actress to Reese Witherspoon.\n\nCalling the overall film \"bland\", \"Variety\"'s Justin Chang agreed with Ebert on Stoner, calling her \"an endearingly vulnerable standout\" and deeming her subplot to be \"the most engaging\" in it. Chang was also kind to Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt and Eugene Levy, deeming the veteran actors did the best with what was given to them. Marrit Ingman of the \"Austin Chronicle\" conceded that it had a good message, and agreed that Hunt was \"marvelous and down-to-earth\" but ultimately felt that \"the rest of the movie is as funny as mildew\", found that \"the product placement is particularly egregious\" and thought that Hilary Duff looked \"as tanned and raw as buffalo jerky\". Andrea Gronvall was also horrified by Duff's appearance while writing for the \"Chicago Reader\", calling her \"haggard\" and \"flat-out scary\", and overall felt that there was \"a discernible lack of enthusiasm from almost everyone involved\", however singling out Carmen Electra for being \"the most winning performer of the bunch\".\n\nThe film received two Razzie Award nominations including Worst Actress (Hilary Duff) and Worst Supporting Actor (Eugene Levy).\n\nThe film grossed $9,309,387 on its opening weekend, finishing in 4th place at the box office.

The stadium was built in 1997. It is the home for the Rookie-league GCL Braves. \n\nThe 7,500-seat stadium was designed by David M. Schwarz in a style designer dubbed \"Florida Picturesque\" incorporating Venetian Gothic Revival, Mediterranean and Spanish influences with yellow-painted stucco, green-tile roofs, towers and arches.\n\nChampion Stadium was originally known as The Ballpark then Cracker Jack Stadium. When it was first built, Frito-Lay purchased the naming rights to the venue for ten years and put its Cracker Jack brand on the stadium. Frito-Lay chose not to renew its naming rights deal. During most of 2007, it was referred to as The Ballpark at Disney's Wide World of Sports. On November 1 of that year, HanesBrands Inc. purchased the naming rights for ten years and put its Champion brand on the stadium.\n\nOriginally, Disney planned for no MLB permanent spring training tenant for the stadium, instead using as a Grapefruit League neutral site with rotating teams. However, the Braves organization became interested and moved in.\nThe Ballpark opened with the rest of Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex on March 28, 1997 with an exhibition baseball game between the Atlanta Braves and the Cincinnati Reds. The Gulf Coast League Braves began play at the stadium in 1997, while the Atlanta Braves started its 20 year spring training lease in 1998.\nIn 2000, after years of poor attendance at Tinker Field, the Orlando Rays moved to the Ballpark. However, the Rays, continued to draw barely 1,000 fans a game in their new stadium. Things improved somewhat over the next three seasons; the Rays drew 150,051 fans in 2003, more than twice what they had seen just a few years earlier at Tinker Field, but still last in the league. Following the 2003 season, the Rays moved (breaking a 10-year lease at Disney after just four years) and became the Montgomery Biscuits.\n\nThe venue hosted the 2001 Atlantic 10 Conference Baseball Tournament, won by Temple. \n\nThe old style manual score board was replaced in 2003 with a larger electronic scoreboard and message center. Champion Stadium was used during first-round games for the 2006 World Baseball Classic. It hosted Pool D, and featured teams with professional players from Venezuela, Australia, Dominican Republic and Italy. \n\nThe stadium hosted its first regular season MLB games from May 15–17, 2007 season when the Texas Rangers played the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in a three-game series. The three games drew a total of 26,917 fans, and attendance went up each game.

It is named for the Sarasota civic leader who was instrumental in getting the new stadium built. It was formerly the spring home of the Chicago White Sox (1989–1997) and the Baltimore Orioles (1991). In 1998, it replaced Plant City Stadium as the spring training home of the Cincinnati Reds. The Reds remained at the facility through 2008. After Cincinnati's club moved its spring activities to Arizona, Ed Smith Stadium spent a year without major league Spring Training.\n\nThe Orioles became the stadium's tenant and operator in 2010. Baltimore had trained in Sarasota before—at Twin Lakes Park in 1989 and 1990, as well as at Ed Smith in 1991—before moving to St. Petersburg and then Ft. Lauderdale for spring games.\n\nFrom 1989 to 2009, the stadium hosted a series of Minor League Baseball teams, the Single-A Sarasota White Sox, Sarasota Red Sox, and Sarasota Reds. From 2004 until 2009, it housed the Gulf Coast League's Gulf Coast Reds. Ed Smith has also hosted high school and college baseball tournaments.\n\nOn November 1, 2008, Barack Obama gave a speech to a crowd of 10,000 spectators as part of his 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nIn 2008, a planned renovation fell through when a proposed bond issue from the city of Sarasota to partially fund the renovation was rejected by the voters. The Reds, whose lease with the city and the stadium expired after the season, announced that they intend to seek a new spring training home. They moved to Goodyear Ballpark, located in Arizona, in 2010.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles reached a tentative 30-year agreement to begin spring training at Ed Smith Stadium starting in 2010 which included renovations to the stadium and surrounding areas. The $31.2 million renovation was completed prior to the beginning of spring training in February 2011.\n\nSeats in the renovated stadium are refurbished seats from the Orioles' revolutionary home ballpark, Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Three air-conditioned suites added to the park are numbered Suites 66, 70, and 83, corresponding to the club's three World Series championships. A fabric sun shade system extends from the stadium's original roof to nearly double the number of seats in the shade.\n\nA series of photos produced by the Orioles shows the dramatic changes resulting from the renovation.\n\nSeating is available for 7,428 spectators, with standing room space taking the park's total capacity to 8,500. Two concourses include food and beverage stands, a cafe, and a gift shop. 100 HDTVs are located throughout the stadium and a HD LED video board in the outfield measures high by across.\n\n"}

The stadium was built in 1966 and holds 7,000 people. It was the spring training home of the Boston Red Sox from 1966 to 1992, after which the Red Sox moved operations to City of Palms Park in Fort Myers.\n\nIn 1993, Cleveland Indians moved into Chain of Lakes Park after their own stadium in Homestead was destroyed by Hurricane Andrew. The stadium served as Cleveland's spring training home until their last game on March 27, 2008. Cleveland moved their spring training operations to Goodyear Ballpark in Goodyear, Arizona in 2009.\n\nThe future of the ballpark and facility is in doubt; its location on Lake Lulu has become valuable for commercial and residential development. In 2011, developers proposed a multipurpose redevelopment of the site, including hotels, restaurants, shops, and a movie theater.\n\n"}

The test is set and run by the Malaysian Examinations Council (which also runs the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia examination). MUET is largely recognised only in Malaysia and Singapore. However, there are still a small number of universities outside of Malaysia and Singapore which recognise MUET.\n\nMost candidates who sit for MUET do so to apply for admissions in public and private universities and colleges. MUET is a prerequisite in applying for admissions into all public universities and colleges in Malaysia. MUET is also accepted for admissions into most universities in Singapore including National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University, as well as a few universities outside Malaysia and Singapore such as University of East London, Manchester Metropolitan University, University of Gloucestershire, Robert Gordon University, Upper Iowa University, Nagoya University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong Polytechnic University and United International College.\n\nThe universities set different target band scores for different courses. For instance, most courses in the Malaysian universities set the minimal requirement of a Band 3 in MUET, while students who want to study Medicine, Law, TESL, English Linguistics, and English Literature are required to obtain at least a Band 4. MUET is also compulsory for graduating from a local university. Thus, candidates are advised to take the MUET as soon as possible to avoid delays in their graduation.\n\nPublic (government) servants also take MUET for promotion opportunities. For instance, police officers, teachers and administrative staff take MUET as an English qualification.\n\nCandidates usually have to register via their institution, private candidates with their State Education Department, with a registration fee which used to be RM 61, but has now gone up to RM 101. Candidates can register for MUET online via the Malaysian Examinations Council website. Although Malaysian government has decided to abolish government examination fees from 2007 onwards, MUET will remain as a paid test. From the year 2012 onwards, MUET is administered thrice a year, in March, July and November. It is advisable to allocate sufficient time for preparation, to obtain the band score required for university. On average, 85,000 candidates sit for the MUET each time.\n\nThere are four components in MUET: \n\nThe maximum scores for each component is 45 for Listening and Speaking, 120 for Reading Comprehension and 90 for Writing, with an aggregate score of 300. The scores are then graded in six bands, with Band 6 being the highest while Band 1 the lowest.\n\nThe Malaysian Examinations Council test centres are largely in public secondary schools () that offer Form 6, matriculation colleges, certain universities, as well as certain private and semi-private colleges. The test is run thrice annually, in March, July and November starting from 2012.\n\nThree components - Listening, Reading Comprehension and Writing, are usually tested on the same day - normally the second or the fourth Saturday of the month, with the same paper nationwide. The Speaking component is tested both as an individual task and in groups of up to four, usually with different papers for different groups. When a test centre uses the same question paper for the Speaking component for more than one group, other groups are sequestered until every group has either finished the test or is in the examination room.\n\n\n"}

It is the spring training home of the Detroit Tigers and the regular-season home of the minor league affiliates Lakeland Flying Tigers and Gulf Coast Tigers. \n\nOn March 15, 2011, the largest crowd in the stadium's history (10,307 people) watched a spring training game between the Detroit Tigers and the Boston Red Sox.\n\nThe stadium could seat 4,900 people when it opened in 1966. In 1988, a bleacher section was added down the left field line, increasing seating capacity to 7,027. In 2002, Joker Marchant Stadium was renovated. The State of Florida's $4.5 million grant was the biggest chunk of the financing, while the Polk County Tourist Development Council chipped in $2 million. The remainder of the renovation's cost was paid for by the Tigers and City of Lakeland, increasing capacity to its present 8,500.\n\nIn October 2014, the Lakeland City Commission announced part of a new agreement with the Detroit Tigers included the start of a $37 million renovation and upgrade of the 50-year-old stadium, starting in April 2016 after Major League Baseball Spring Training. Funding provided in part by the Detroit Tigers, the City of Lakeland and Polk County. Two construction firms Barton Malow of Southfield, Michigan and Rodda Construction of Lakeland were chosen by the City Commission to oversee the project. The Lakeland Flying Tigers, which are the Detroit Tigers' High Class 'A' Minor League club, played their Florida State League season at Henley Field, away.\n\nUnder a 20-year deal that ends in 2036, the stadium was renamed Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium on the first day of MLB's 2017 Spring Training. The Publix supermarket chain is headquartered in Lakeland and their hometown field is the only sports complex for which they have purchased naming rights. \n\n"}

In both venues, the teams share the main stadium where the games are played. However, the teams have their own practice fields, outdoor batting cages, several pitching mounds, and state-of-the-art conditioning rooms.\n\nThrough 2002 the Montreal Expos shared the stadium with the Cardinals, until they swapped with the Marlins as part of the Marlins sale to Jeffrey Loria.

Gillis and Mike Saenz, and published by First Comics. A dystopian science fiction fantasy somewhat in the mold of \"Blade Runner, We Can Remember It for You Wholesale (Total Recall)\", and other cyberpunk stories. \"Shatter\" was written by Gillis and illustrated directly on the computer by Saenz.\n\n\"Shatter\" was the first commercially published all-digital comic where all art for publication was entered by hand on the computer as opposed to later methods of scanning in inked pages for color application. Until the late 1970s to early 1980s computer generated comics were done with traditional text and line-printing techniques or semigraphics, ascii art, and BBC's ceefax teletext.\n\n\"Shatter\" was drawn on an original Macintosh Plus in MacPaint and later using FullPaint by Ann Arbor Softworks. Page data was stored on an external 800K floppy disk drive. The drawings were difficult to manage due to the limited 9\" 72ppi monochrome screen (512×342 pixels) as only roughly 2/3 of the page was able to be worked on at one time. Approximately half of the issues were drawn using the standard Macintosh mouse until graphics tablet pen type digitizers became available. Artwork was printed on an Apple dot-matrix ImageWriter until 1985 when Apple donated a Laserwriter enabling Adobe PostScript font styles for typesetting text, and made illustration graphics smoother and less pixelated. Once printed the art was then colored by Saenz, and then photographed for mass printing using traditional comic publication techniques for page layouts and color separation.\n\nFollowing Saenz' departure after issue #3, issues 4-7 diverged to traditional art on board artwork which was scanned into the computer. Once Charlie Athanas was hired for issues 8 until the series end the artwork returned to a nearly all digital workflow. The only exception were that rough pencil drafts started the process which allowed editors to approve layouts and writers to begin creating the stories. Artwork was still directly drawn into the computer. The new method allowed for faster publication times for the remainder of the series.\n\nThe first episode of \"Shatter\" appeared in the March 1985 issue (#12) of computer magazine \"Big K\" (IPC Media, London with Tony Tyler as editor) and was described as \"the world's first comics series entirely drawn on a computer.\" During this same period, \"Shatter\" appeared simultaneously as a one-shot special and as a backup feature in First Comics’ \"Jon Sable\" title in 1985. \"Shatter\" was then published as its own 14-issue series from 1985-1988. The book was art-directed by Alex Wald. Collections have been published by First Comics and AiT/Planet Lar.\n\n\nThe Shatter trade paperback collection describes the plot like this:\n\n\n"}

It has been broadcast live on the Nine Network since 1982. The show airs after \"Nine News: Early Edition\" and runs from 5:30 am to 9:00 am before \"Today Extra\". The show is broadcast from the Nine Network studios in Willoughby, a suburb located on the North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales.\n\nOfficially launched as \"The National Today Show\", \"Today\" is Australia's longest running morning breakfast news program. The show premiered on 28 June 1982. The original hosts, Steve Liebmann and Sue Kellaway, spent four years together before Liebmann left to present the evening news for Network Ten in Sydney. Former \"60 Minutes\" reporter George Negus took over the male presenting role. After four years, Liebmann returned to the Nine Network, hosting \"Today\" with Liz Hayes and Tracy Grimshaw. However, in December 2004, Liebmann had a mild heart attack, prompting him to retire from breakfast television.\n\nIn 2005, \"National Nine News\" reporter Karl Stefanovic replaced Liebmann as co-host. Tracy Grimshaw left \"Today\" at the end of 2005 to replace Ray Martin as host of \"A Current Affair\". While it had been widely speculated in the Australian press that \"Seven News\" presenter Chris Bath would co-host \"Today\" with Karl Stefanovic from January 2006, the position instead went to former \"Ten News\" presenter Jessica Rowe. Rowe had mixed beginnings as the co-host of \"Today\" with some viewers and commentators criticising her because of her dress-sense and her apparent over-happiness, citing her constant nervous laughter. Following her court case against Network Ten, Rowe was subjected to comments from the media and viewers that she should be sacked and was not right for the role of \"Today\". Rowe's replacements while on maternity leave were Sarah Murdoch and Kellie Sloane, who both saw a significant increases in ratings. They both presented until Rowe's departure from the show, when the Nine Network released a press statement on 5 May 2007 saying that Rowe had left the Nine Network to \"take up other opportunities for her career\".\n\nIn May 2007, former co-host of \"Weekend Sunrise\", Lisa Wilkinson, took over the female co-hosting duties. In October 2017, Wilkinson resigned effective immediately from the network due to contract negotiations failing. She finished on the show on 16 October 2017. It was later announced that Wilkinson would join Network Ten and \"The Project\" as a senior host and editor. Deborah Knight temporarily replaced Wilkinson until Georgie Gardner, who previously regularly appeared on the program as its news presenter, was announced as a permanent replacement host. Gardner commenced hosting \"Today\" in January 2018.\n\nIn December 2018, it was announced that Karl Stefanovic would not be returning to \"Today\" after 14 years as host.\n\nOn 5 January 2019, the Nine Network announced that Deborah Knight would join Georgie Gardner as co-host replacing Stefanovic. It was also announced that Tom Steinfort would replace Sylvia Jeffreys as news presenter and Tony Jones would replace Tim Gilbert as sports presenter and Brooke Boney would become entertainment presenter, working alongside Richard Wilkins. The new team began on 14 January 2019. In February 2019 it was announced that Natalia Cooper would not return to the show after her maternity leave, with Steven Jacobs becoming weather presenter once again.\n\nThe revamped line-up attracted constant media scrutiny and struggled to attain viewers – at times recording record-low ratings. It has been noted by some commentators however that the viewership gap with \"Sunrise\" was actually higher in Wilkinson's first year as co-host in 2007, with the audience building over time to eventually overtake \"Sunrise\". The lower ratings were also contributed to the fact that overall television audiences had decreased in comparison with prior years.\n\nIn November 2019, the Nine Network announced that Karl Stefanovic will return to the show as co-host alongside \"Weekend Today\" co-host and \"60 Minutes\" reporter Allison Langdon from January 2020. Both Georgie Gardner and Deborah Knight will remain with the Nine Network with Gardner leaving the show immediately.\n\nIn December 2019, it was announced that Tracy Vo will replace Tom Steinfort as news presenter, Alex Cullen would replace Tony Jones as sports presenter and Tim Davies will replace Steven Jacobs as weather presenter\n\nIn January 2016, Nine announced that \"Mornings\" would be rebranded as \"Today Extra\" to become an extension of the network's breakfast show \"Today\". The show was moved to the \"Today\" studio, while keeping its focus on light entertainment and news updates.\n\nIn January 2019, Campbell was announced the new host of \"Weekend Today\". He will continue to host the program on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with Richard Wilkins joining the show as co-host on Thursdays and Fridays.\n\nIn December 2019, it was announced that Sylvia Jeffreys will replace Sonia Kruger permanently upon her return from maternity leave in 2020. David Campbell will return to hosting the show each weekday, with Richard Wilkins moving to host \"Weekend Today\".\n\nIn January 2009, David Gyngell, chief executive of the Nine Network, and John Westacott, former head of news and current affairs, announced that \"Today\" would begin broadcasting on Sunday mornings. The program, entitled \"Today on Sunday\", competes in the same timeslot as the Seven Network's \"Weekend Sunrise\", which dominates Sunday morning television. The show launched on 1 February 2009 and the original team consisted of Cameron Williams and Leila McKinnon with the news presented by Amber Sherlock and the sport was presented by Tim Gilbert on Saturday and Michael Slater on Sunday.\n\nOn 2 May 2009, after the launch of \"Today on Sunday Australia\", the Nine Network announced through a surprise edition that \"Today on Saturday Australia\" would return. The program incorporates the same presenting team as the Sunday edition, being the first Australian breakfast news program to broadcast seven days a week. Due to the launch of the Saturday version of the program, the Nine Network renamed the programs as \"Today: Weekend Edition Australia\". David Gyngell said that the launch of the weekend editions were a part of the Nine Network's plans to strengthen its news and current affairs department and return viewers to its once leading service. In July 2009, \"Today: Weekend Edition Australia\" was renamed as \"Weekend Today\". In September 2012, \"Weekend Today\" was extended to three hours on Saturday.\n\nIn September 2014, Deborah Knight permanently replaced Leila McKinnon as co-host of the show; following McKinnon's move to the news department.\n\nIn November 2016, Peter Stefanovic announced that he would be moving to \"60 Minutes\" in 2017 as a reporter. Tom Steinfort was announced as Stefanovic's replacement.\n\nIn December 2017, Deborah Knight was appointed as host of \"Nine News Sydney\" on Friday and Saturday nights. She replaced Georgie Gardner who replaced Lisa Wilkinson on \"Today\". It was later announced that \"60 Minutes\" reporter Allison Langdon would replace Knight on \"Weekend Today\". Peter Stefanovic also returned as host replacing Tom Steinfort who will become a reporter on \"60 Minutes\".\n\nIn December 2018, it was announced that Peter Stefanovic had parted ways with the Nine Network to pursue other opportunities. David Campbell was later announced as his replacement.\n\nIn January 2019, David Campbell and Allison Langdon are the co-hosts with the news presented by Jayne Azzopardi, sport presented by Clint Stanaway and weather presented by Tim Davies.\n\nIn November 2019, the Nine Network announced that Allison Langdon will co-host \"Today\" with Karl Stefanovic from January 2020.\n\nIn December 2019, Richard Wilkins and Rebecca Maddern were announced as co-hosts of \"Weekend Today\" from January 2020 replacing both David Campbell and Allison Langdon. Jayne Azzopardi will continue as news presenter, while Lauren Phillips will join the show as weather presenter.\n\nAfter the initial success of \"Today\", a Saturday edition was produced in the early nineties. Hosted by Tracy Grimshaw, it featured more news, politics and economic reports. Tracy Grimshaw was later followed by Tara Brown and Richard Wilkins, before reporter Helen Dalley joined the program in 1996. These hosts were accompanied by news presenters Michael Usher, Anna Coren and Mark Burrows. In 2002, \"Today on Saturday Australia\" was cancelled due to budget cuts by the Nine Network.\n\n\"Today\" celebrated its 25th year of broadcasting, on 28 June 2007, by travelling to five different Australian cities in one week, something which had never been before attempted by an Australian television show. Former \"Today\" presenters and musical guests were involved.\n\nOn the official day marking the 25th anniversary, past \"Today\" presenters who made an appearance included Ian Ross, Tracy Grimshaw, Monte Dwyer, Liz Hayes and Helen Dalley. Sami Lukis, who replaced Monte Dwyer, did not appear, nor did original co-host Sue Kellaway. Original co-host Steve Liebmann was also unable to attend, nor was current weather presenter Steven Jacobs, however video messages from both were aired.\n\nIn 2012, \"Today\" celebrated its 30th anniversary. The show began the year by unveiling a new set, logo and graphics.\n\nIn September, \"Today\" held a week-long celebration which included flashbacks from earlier episodes and live appearances by former hosts such as Steve Liebmann, Sue Kellaway, Tracy Grimshaw, Monte Dwyer and Sarah Murdoch. Liz Hayes was unable to join the show due to being on assignment with \"60 Minutes\" but shared her memories in a prerecorded message. Video messages were also left by Brian Bury, George Negus and Joan McInnes\n\n\"Today\", an offshoot of \"Nine News\", predominantly presents news, sport, weather, entertainment and current affairs, focusing on the first news of the day. However the show also features topics including consumer affairs, health, politics, education, fashion, and the business and finance world. The show has daily feedback and topic segments for viewers to send in their thoughts and opinions via email, text messages and the show's website.\n\nInitially, the program was only a two-hour broadcast, airing from 7:00 am to 9:00 am. After dropping \"Nine Early Morning News\", the network moved \"Today\" to a 6:00 am start. Again, as part of the 2008–2009 \"Nine News\" brand's major expansion, in 2008 the show was changed to a three and a half-hour format, starting at 5.30 am to now \"perfect match\" breakfast radio stations. This move included an extended news, sport, finance and weather segment prior to the main program at 6:00 am. \"Weekend Today\" airs on both Saturday and Sunday from 7:00 am to 10:00 am.\n\nThe main presenters of \"Today\" have included:\n\nDeborah Knight, Lara Vella, Ben Fordham and Brenton Ragless are main fill-in presenters. Substitutes that present usually over summer include; Richard Wilkins, Jayne Azzopardi, Wendy Kingston, Tom Steinfort, David Campbell, Chris Uhlmann, Brenton Ragless, Alicia Loxley or Lara Vella.\n\nSubstitute presenters in recent years have included Cameron Williams, Kellie Sloane, Tim McMillan, Sarah Murdoch, Sharyn Ghidella, Leila McKinnon, Kim Watkins, Helen Dalley, Ellen Fanning, Ali Moore, Michael Pascoe, Peter FitzSimons, Peter Overton, Ross Greenwood, Michael Usher, Ken Sutcliffe, Mark Ferguson, Jennifer Keyte, Garry Lyon, Eddie McGuire, Allison Langdon and even Clive James on one occasion while the show was broadcasting from London. The former Premier of Victoria, Joan Kirner, presented the show on one occasion.\n\nThe idea of providing the latest news has been critical to the function of the program. Under the current format, seven main bulletins are delivered, once every half-hour. \n\"Today Perth\" news presenters:\n\nDuring 2007, Kellie Sloane and Allison Langdon filled in for Georgie Gardner who was on maternity leave.\n\nIn July 2009, Georgie Gardner was appointed \"Nine News Sydney\" presenter on Friday and Saturday nights, she juggled her commitments with \"Today\" and presented the news from Tuesday to Friday. The \"Weekend Today\" news presenter would present the news on Monday. These news presenters have included Amber Sherlock (2009-2010), Alicia Loxley (2010-2011) and Deborah Knight (2011-2014).\n\nIn 2014, Sylvia Jeffreys was appointed news presenter on \"Today\" replacing Gardner. Given that Sylvia would not be required to balance her role with any additional roles within the network, she was able to commit to the program five days per week, meaning the specialised Monday morning news presenting role was no longer needed.\n\nIn December 2018, it was announced that Jeffreys would not return to \"Today\" in 2019 and move onto other projects. In January 2019, Tom Steinfort was announced as Jeffrey's replacement.\n\nIn December 2019, it was announced, \"Nine Live Perth\" news presenter, Tracy Vo would be the news presenter with Steinfort returning to \"60 Minutes\".\n\nIn March 2020, Vo permanently returned to Perth due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Alex Cullen is currently presenting both news and sport.\n\n\"Today Perth\" local news inserts were introduced in March 2014, but were axed in May 2020.\n\nJayne Azzopardi, Lara Vella, Mark Burrows, Brett McLeod and Brenton Ragless are the main fill-in news presenters.\n\nAmelia Adams, Amber Sherlock, Wendy Kingston, Kim Watkins, Ben Fordham, Peter Stefanovic, Vicky Jardim, Majella Wiemers, Helen Kapalos, Heather Foord, Peter Overton, Aislin Kriukelis, Allison Langdon, Alex Cullen and Mark Ferguson have all among others presented the news on occasions.\n\nAlex Cullen currently presents the finance news after presenting the news.\n\nAlex Cullen currently presents sports news after the news bulletin every half-hour. In 2006, Cameron Williams was appointed as the inaugural sports presenter previously the news presenter would present sport headlines. Williams presented sport from 2006 until 2010, leaving the role to focus on co-hosting \"Weekend Today\" and \"Nine News\". Ben Fordham presented sport from 2011 until 2014. He left to focus on his family and 2GB radio show. In January 2019, Tony Jones was announced as Gilbert's replacement. Jones remained in the position until his resignation in November 2019. In December 2019, it was announced that Alex Cullen will replace Tony Jones as sport presenter permanently from January 2020.\nTim Davies currently presents the weather after each news and sport bulletin, every half-hour. \nLauren Phillips, Alex Heinke, Abby Coleman, Julie Snook, Rose Jacobs, Emma Freedman, Amelia Adams, Sylvia Jeffreys, Giaan Rooney, Gorgi Coghlan, Dave Kirwan, Jaynie Seal, Livinia Nixon and Majella Wiemers have all presented the weather on various occasions.\n\n\"Today's\" entertainment presenter, Richard Wilkins (Nine Network's entertainment editor), presents daily features, interviews, movie and television reviews from across the world of show business. In December 2018, it was announced that Brooke Boney would join \"Today\" as an entertainment reporter and will work alongside Wilkins.

Traffic reports only air into the metropolitan regions of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. They are produced and presented by traffic reporters from the Australian Traffic Network.\n\nFrom 2004–2007, \"Sunrise\" won the ratings battle, defeating \"Today\" by 62% between January and May 2007. However, during 2007, \"Today\" slightly improved its ratings and made audience gains, and made a 9% rise from 2006 between 7am and 9am, and a 16% increase in the key 6am to 7am news hour. In contrast, \"Sunrise\" fell 4% year-on-year in the 7am to 9am timeslot. Since Lisa Wilkinson joined \"Today\" in May 2007, the program constistingly defeated \"Sunrise\" in Melbourne.\n\nOn Good Friday 2009, \"Today\" defeated \"Sunrise\" for the first time in five years. Over the next four years, \"Today\" continued to make inroads on \"Sunrise\", defeating them for a weekly win in June 2011 for the first time in seven years, and winning Sydney in 2012. However, upon Samantha Armytage's appointment as host of \"Sunrise\" in August 2013, \"Today\"'s rating slipped for the next two years.\n\nAfter some sizeable wins in the second half of 2015, \"Today\" mananged some of its best ever ratings in early 2016. \"Today\" defeated \"Sunrise\" in 2016 based on weeks won.\n\nAfter \"Sunrise\" reclaimed the ratings crown in 2017, the program's ratings slipped significantly in 2018, due to negative headlines surrounding co-host Karl Stefanovic. After Stefanovic was axed at the end of that year, the ratings for \"Today\" slipped even further in 2019, often posing record low ratings.\n\nDue to the fact that Australia has more than one time zone, \"Today\" is not broadcast live to the entire nation.\n\nNew South Wales (including ACT), Victoria and Tasmania have \"Today\" aired live all year round.\n\nDuring daylight saving time, Queensland receives \"Today\" delayed by one hour. However, in 2007, \"Today\" began a trial and aired live into Queensland between 5:00 – 8.30am, with an extra Queensland-only half-hour. This was unsuccessful, and in 2008 the show returned to its previous delayed telecast.\n\nAdditionally, the Northern Territory has \"Today\" delayed thirty minutes during winter and one-and-a-half hours during daylight saving time.\n\nSome parts of South Australia are also delayed by thirty minutes, and in Western Australia, the program is delayed by two hours during winter and three hours during daylight saving time.\n\nIn the case of major breaking news (e.g. cyclone), the program goes live into the state to help provide residents with up-to-date information.\n\nSouthern Cross Nine & Imparja air \"Today\" across regional Australia.\n\nIn addition to Australia, \"Today\" is broadcast in Papua New Guinea and Fiji.\n\nPapua New Guinea on EMTV, and in Fiji on Fiji Television.\n\nEven though the name of the show is the same as America's NBC \"Today Show\", it has no link to its American namesake; in fact, due to affiliate agreements, Nine airs ABC's \"Good Morning America\", one of the American program's chief competitors, between 4.00 and 5.00am. \"Today\"s rival on the Seven Network, \"Sunrise\", follows the American NBC \"Today Show\" format, including a streetside studio. The Seven Network airs a condensed version of the American programme between 4.00 and 5.00am, preceding \"Sunrise\", which is titled \"NBC Today\" in program listings to avert confusion.\n\n"}

The highway begins at Interstate 44, passes through Duenweg, Duquesne, and Joplin, then crosses into Kansas becoming K-66.\n\nRoute 66 begins at the Kansas state line in Jasper County, where it continues west into that state as K-66. From the state line, the route heads northeast on West 7th Street, a four-lane divided highway also marked as \"Historic Route 66\". The road intersects Old Route 66, at which point it curves to the east. Route 66 passes through wooded areas with some development, passing through Central City. Farther east, the median becomes a center left-turn lane as the highway passes businesses. The route crosses into Joplin and intersects the southern terminus of Route P.

{"id": "1922847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922847", "title": "Lashkargah", "text": "Lashkargah\n\nLashkargāh (; ), historically called Bost or Boost (), is a city in southwestern Afghanistan and the capital of Helmand Province. It is located in Lashkargah District, where the Arghandab River merges into the Helmand River. The city has a population of 201,546 as of 2006. Lashkargah is linked by major roads with Kandahar to the east, Zaranj on the border with Iran to the west, and Farah and Herat to the north-west. It is mostly very arid and desolate. However, farming does exist around the Helmand and Arghandab rivers. Bost Airport is located on the east bank of the Helmand River, five miles north of the junction of the Helmand and Argahandab rivers.\n\nLashkargah means \"army barracks\" in Persian language. The area was part of the Saffarids in the 9th century. It grew up a thousand years ago as a riverside barracks town for soldiers accompanying the Ghaznavid nobility to their grand winter capital of Bost. The ruins of the Ghaznavid mansions still stand along the Helmand River; the city of Bost and its outlying communities were sacked in successive centuries by the Ghorids, Mongols, and Timurids. However, the region was later rebuilt by Timur/Tamerlane (Timur Lang).\n\nBy the late 16th century the city and region was governed by the Safavid dynasty. It became part of the Afghan Hotaki Empire in 1709. It was invaded by the Afsharid forces in 1738 on their way to Kandahar. By 1747 it became part of the Durrani Empire or modern Afghanistan. The British arrived in or about 1840 during the First Anglo-Afghan War but left about year later. The city was used by Ayub Khan in the Second Anglo-Afghan War until 1880 when the British helped return it to Abdur Rahman Khan. It remained peaceful for the next 100 years. \nThe modern city of Lashkargah was used as a headquarters for United States Army Corps of Engineers working on the Helmand Valley Authority (HVA) irrigation project in the 1950s, modeled after the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the United States. Lashkargah was built using American designs, with broad tree-lined streets and brick houses with no walls separating them from the street. In the wake of the Soviet invasion and the long Afghan civil war, the trees mostly came down and walls went up.\n\nThe massive Helmand irrigation project in the 1940s–1970s created one of the most extensive farming zones in southern Afghanistan, opening up many thousands of hectares of desert to human cultivation and habitation. The project focused on three large canals: the Boghra, Shamalan, and Darweshan. Responsibility for maintaining the canals was given to the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority (HAVA), a semi-independent government agency whose authority (in its heyday) rivaled that of the provincial governors.\n\nAfter the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in 1989 and the collapse of Mohammad Najibullah's government in 1992, the city was taken over by the Mujaheddin forces. In the mid-1990s it fell to the Taliban government. In late 2001, the Taliban were removed from power by the United States armed forces. Since 2002, the city and region was occupied by United States Marine Corps and the International Security Assistance Force. In 2008, Taliban forces attacked the city heavily but the Afghan National Army and the Oregon Army National Guard managed to hold them back, as shown in the documentary, \"Shepherds of Helmand.\" After training and equipping Afghan security forces, the foreign armies transferred security responsibility to the military of Afghanistan and Afghan National Police in 2011. The city has witnessed some fighting in the form of attacks orchestrated by the Taliban insurgents.\n\nLashkargah has a hot desert climate (Köppen \"BWh\"), characterised by little precipitation and high variation between summer and winter temperatures. The average temperature in Lashkargah is 20.1 °C, while the annual precipitation averages 97 mm. Summers start in mid-May, last until late-September, and are extremely dry. July is the hottest month of the year with an average temperature of 32.8 °C. The coldest month January has an average temperature of 7.6 °C.\n\nThe Helmand River is the longest in Afghanistan with a length of 1,150 km. The river originates in the Hindu Kush and ends in Hamun-i-Helmand in the Sistan and Baluchistan province of neighboring Iran. One of the two primary arms of the river crosses through Lashkargah, giving it the attractive air of a riverside city. It makes for a pleasant setting for the citizens of Lashkargah to picnic. The river is deep enough at Lashkargah to allow for varied water sports, including swimming and boating. Boats are available for rent to the public. Mirwais Neka Park was recently built on the banks of the river. There is a large thicket located on the opposite side of the river from the city. Many types of trees and different species of birds, mammals, and reptiles inhabit the thicket.\n\nThe great fortress of Bost, Qala-e-Bost, remains an impressive ruin. It is located at 31° 30’ 02″ N, 64° 21’ 24″ E near the convergence of the Helmand and Arghandab Rivers, a half-hour's drive south of Lashkargah. Qala-e-Bost is famous for its decorative arch, which appears on the 100 Afghani note (Afghan currency). As of April 2008, it was possible to descend into an ancient shaft about 20 feet across and 200 feet deep, with a series of dark side rooms and a spiral staircase leading to the bottom. In 2006 construction began on a cobblestone road to lead from the south of Lashkargah to the Qala-e-Bost Arch (known to readers of James A. Michener's \"Caravans\" as Qala Bist.)\n\nThe population of Lashkargah numbered approximately 201,546 as of 2006. In 2015 it has been estimated at about 276,831.\n\nLashkargah is a Trading and Transit Hub in southern Afghanistan. As it is located at the confluence of the Helmand and Arghandab rivers, it is blessed with the most hectares of water (4,940 Ha) of any provincial capital in the country. Agriculture consequently accounts for the largest amount of land use (61%). Dwellings are clustered in the central districts.\n\nThe level of education in Lashkargah had been very high during the 1960s and 70s before the Soviet Invasion and Civil War. The students were talented, active, and hard workers. They were always taking up good positions within the universities. There are around 27 schools, a teacher's training institute, an agricultural school, Lashkargah Technical, Agricultural and Veterinarian Institute 800 M past the Bolan Bridge founded in 2011, with Abdul Malek as dean. Lashkargah has a number of Higher educational institutions the Public Helmand University founded in 2008, with Soor Gul Sandakheel as Chancellor with a campus close to the Peace Square and a new Campus to be built close to Lashkargah with a construction budget of 1.5 million US$. Helmand University has four faculties, Agriculture, engineering, education and veterinarian.\nThe Bost Institute of higher education in Helmand Province is a private, non-sectarian institution of higher education founded in 1391–2012 in Lashkargah with courses in law, engineering and business administration. \nThe Bost Agricultural university was registered with the Ministry of Higher Education in 2007, and was inaugurated by former governor of Helmand Province, Assadullah Wafa. Bost Agricultural University currently only provides education in the field of Agriculture. There are also many computer and English language courses in the city, and thousands of students are attending them.\n\nBesides the activities of the Department of Culture and Information of Helmand Province, the youth are also actively involved in different cultural and educational activities. There are different cultural groups operating in Lashkargah, including: the Helmand Youth Organization, the Bost Cultural Society, the Allama Mahmud Tarzi Educational and Cultural Association, and the Helmand Cultural Group. There are also various cultural and educational websites which are made and updated by students and cultural organizations.\nThere is broad use of the media in Lashkargah. The use of Radio, Television, and Internet has significantly increased in the last decade. Several radio stations are broadcasting in Lashkargah, including Tamadoon Radio 90.6 FM, Sabawoon Radio, Samoon Radio, and Helmand Radio. Besides many other local Afghan and international TV channels, there is also a Bost Television channel broadcasting from Lashkargah.\n\nThe city of Lashkargah has undergone large scale development in the past few years with new roads, markets and residential areas constructed. Many Afghans continue to leave their tribes and emigrate towards cities – such as Lashkargah. Government projects distributed land to the people, increasing the approximate size of the city. Modern architecture and building methods are more common, now, here than Mud squats and other more traditional Afghan architecture. The current Governor of Helmand province, Gulab Mangal, has funded large scale development of the city, the Governor's office and Justice Department have been recently renovated, new Police Headquarters and Eidgah have also been funded. Unlike much of Afghanistan the roads in Lashkargah are generally paved with asphalt. International Organizations and PRT in Lashkargah have helped to complete rehabilitation and infrastructure projects such as building: schools, roads and parks.\n\nIn 2005 it was announced that a USAID-funded project would build six reservoirs in Lashkargah, with responsibility for the water supply then being handed over to the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority. The city had been without fresh water for the previous 30 years due to the contamination of the Helmand River.\n\nAs part of Operation Moshtarak in 2010, the British Army and local workforces constructed Route Trident, a road to connect Lashkargah and the northern, more developed city of Gereshk,\nGovernor Mangal's efforts to restructure the city have left Route Trident underfunded, but highly ranked in the priority of rebuilding Lashkargah.\n\nA current project in the city, to aid regeneration is the \"Lashkargah Bost Airport and Agriculture Center\". This project will consist of constructing a new agricultural center, an Industrial Park and will repair, upgrade and modernise Bost Airport through renovation projects.\n\nFootball and cricket are the most popular sports in the area. The Lashkargah Football Stadium was rebuilt in 2006 and has a capacity of more around 10,000 spectators. Currently, 13 registered cricket teams are playing at the new Karzai Stadium in Lashkargah, which was completed in the summer of 2009.\n\nBodybuilding has also attracted the youth of Lashkargah. There are several gymnasiums in the city. Aziz Ahmad Nikyar gained the title of Mr. Afghanistan in 2006, and also participated in the 2006 Asian Games representing AfghanistanOther popular sports in Lashkargah are Taekwondo, Boxing, Snooker, Volleyball.\n\nAccording to a recent BBC programme which interviewed an American-born Afghan, whose father worked on the irrigation project, it was envisaged to create agriculture, but has in fact in recent times contributed ironically to the growth of opium poppy farming.\n\n\n\n"}

In addition to the Dodgers' spring games, it was the home of the Vero Beach Devil Rays, previously the Vero Beach Dodgers, of the Florida State League, through the 2008 season. The official seating capacity is 6,500.\n\nThe then-Brooklyn Dodgers were one of the first major league baseball teams to conduct spring training in Florida, establishing their operations in this quiet beachside town in 1948. Previously an abandoned Naval base, the complex was transformed for the Dodgers. Historic Dodgertown and Holman Stadium served as their spring home for more than 60 years. In recent decades, Arizona has established itself alongside Florida as the second major center for spring baseball, and the Dodgers were the last Western team in Major League Baseball to still conduct their spring training in Florida, having retained their spring training home even after the team moved to Los Angeles in 1958.\n\nIn 2001, the Dodgers seriously considered moving their spring training operations to Arizona, but the city of Vero Beach persuaded them to stay by purchasing the Historic Dodgertown complex from the team and leasing it back for a nominal $1 per year. In 2006, the Dodgers again received offers from several Arizona cities, attempting to persuade them to move. Ultimately, the offers were too lucrative to overcome the burden of having to reimburse Vero Beach for purchasing the complex. With the Camelback Ranch opening in Glendale in 2009, the Dodgers joined the Chicago White Sox to share the new facility. The Dodgers' last spring training game in Vero Beach was on March 17, 2008.\n\nHolman is unique for its open-air dugouts that are literally dug out along the sides of the field. These may have been the inspiration for the dugouts in Johnny Hart's \"B.C.\" comic strip. \"This place is so different from any other park\", states George Betscha, a batboy at Dodgertown from 2005–2008. \"There is so much history here and you can feel it when you walk around.\"\n\nIn addition to baseball, the Holman Stadium complex and conference center has hosted training sessions by the New Orleans Saints, the Green Bay Packers, the Cleveland Browns, the Buffalo Bills, the New England Patriots, the Kansas City Chiefs, the Philadelphia Eagles, and the college teams of the Miami Hurricanes, the Ohio State Buckeyes and the University of South Florida Bulls. Holman Stadium has also played host to some international teams such as the Yomiuri Giants, the Chunichi Dragons, the Osaka Buffaloes (Japan), the Samsung Lions, the LG Twins, the SK Wyverns, , the Sinon Bulls Taiwanese team, the Nigeria national baseball team, and the Moscow Red Devils. Outside of sports, on March 31, 1961 at 7:30 p.m., famed evangelist Dr. Billy Graham held a Good Friday service at Holman Stadium during his Florida Crusades.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles were recruited to move up to Vero Beach in 2010, from their spring home in Fort Lauderdale, but after failing to reach an agreement, the City of Vero Beach rescinded its offer.\n\nThe city is exploring other options outside of Major League Baseball spring training. Reports surfaced in 2009 that the Major League Baseball Players Association was considering Holman Stadium as an alternate training site for players who entered the spring as unsigned free agents. However, the MLBPA decided not to go forward with the plan.\n\nAs of 2017, nearby Dodgertown Elementary School has not changed its name.\n\nThe United Football League expressed an early interest in using the Historic Dodgertown facility as a training and practice grounds, but no agreement to do so was ever reached. During the final (2012) season, each team utilized a training site in or near its home market.\n\nDodgertown became the Vero Beach Sports Village in 2010. It is now used for sports tournaments including baseball and football tournaments, concerts and other special events. In 2013, former Dodger owner Peter O'Malley and current Dodger ownership, headed by President Stan Kasten, reached agreement to re-brand Vero Beach Sports Village under the name Historic Dodgertown. Historic Dodgertown now holds year round youth sports tournaments in baseball, soccer, lacrosse, and Minor League Baseball's Umpire Training Academy.\n\n\n"}

It was constructed in 1937, as a multi-purpose stadium, by the City of Nashua. The official seating capacity is 2,800 people. Holman is the home of the Nashua Silver Knights of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League.\n\nThe city-owned stadium is named for Charles Frank Holman, who contributed $55,000 for the project. Holman Stadium, which also was funded by the federal Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression, was dedicated to the youth and people of Nashua in memory of Holman's parents. Philip S. Avery, a Nashua native, was the architect. The original Holman Stadium was a plain seating bowl in which fans sat on bleachers and concrete steps. It was used for baseball and football. The stadium has hosted concerts by famous artists including Aerosmith, The Beach Boys, Bon Jovi, David Cassidy, Elvis Costello, Bob Dylan, The J. Geils Band, Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, and Warren Zevon. In 1996, the stadium was a site for celebrations along the Olympic Torch Relay route.\n\nThe stadium was home to several minor-league affiliates of Major League Baseball organizations, beginning with the Nashua Dodgers, affiliated with the Brooklyn Dodgers and managed by Walter Alston. Holman hosted the first integrated U.S. baseball team in the modern era when Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe played for the Nashua Dodgers in 1946.\n\nAfter the Dodgers' four-year run, baseball did not return to Holman Stadium until 1983, at the double-A level: an affiliate of the California Angels for one year, then the Pittsburgh Pirates. While home to the Nashua Pirates in 1985, Holman Stadium hosted the Eastern League All-Star Game.\n\nThe Nashua Hawks of the North Atlantic League played at Holman Stadium in 1995, ending in 1996 with a mid-season eviction for nonpayment of rent.\n\nIn 1998, Holman Stadium became home to the Nashua Pride of the Atlantic League. The Pride acquired turquoise-colored stadium seating from Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. The Pride's pre-emption of dates from high-school football became a focus of neighborhood opposition, but eventually the city built Stellos Stadium for football.\n\nBetween the 2001 and 2002 seasons, the stadium was upgraded generally: The open-air desks in the brick press box were raised, enclosed and modernized; a new level of luxury boxes was built above it, the concourse outside the seating bowl was upgraded with a ticket office and gift shop, and the business offices were upgraded. In 2003, Holman Stadium hosted the Atlantic League All-Star Game.\n\nIn 2006, the Pride switched to the Can-Am League with its shorter season. In 2008, the team was sold to an ownership group including former Boston Red Sox General Manager Dan Duquette and renamed the American Defenders of New Hampshire. The Defenders played a single season in 2009, concluded on the road because of non-payments to the city; in 2010, the team moved to Pittsfield, Massachusetts to become the Pittsfield Colonials.\n\nIn 2011, the Nashua Silver Knights brought baseball back to Holman Stadium. In 2012, Holman Stadium hosted the inaugural FCBL All-Star Game. The former football bleachers, down the left-field line, were removed, reducing the stadium's capacity to the current 2,800; the football press box remains but is now used as a storage shed.\n\nIn 2017, the city installed a new sound system and a small videoboard beyond left field, costing $173,000, of which $56,000 was paid for by the Silver Knights. The videoboard supersedes a two-line alphanumeric message board that had not worked for the preceding four years and could not be repaired.\n\nIn the springtime, the stadium serves as the home field for two of Nashua's schools, the Raiders of Rivier University and the Cardinals of Bishop Guertin High School.\n\nBaseball clubs at Holman Stadium compete for fans' attention with the New Hampshire Fisher Cats in Manchester (double-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays); and with the Lowell Spinners (single-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox), which owned and operated the Nashua Silver Knights until 2016.\n\n\n"}

The stadium was built in time for the 1988 season and holds 7,160 people. It is the spring training home of the New York Mets (who moved from St. Petersburg's Al Lang Stadium), as well as the home to the St. Lucie Mets Class A team and the Gulf Coast Mets Rookie League team. The stadium also sometimes hosts college games.\n\nThomas J. White, the person for whom the stadium was originally named, was a real estate developer from St. Louis, Missouri who worked with sportswriter Jack Champion on the successful campaign to bring the Mets to Port St. Lucie. He was the master developer who gave birth to the town of St. Lucie West. In 2004 the Mets changed the name of the venue to Tradition Field.\n\nOn March 23, 2010, during a Mets spring training game against the Atlanta Braves, it was announced that effective immediately the stadium would be renamed Digital Domain Park as a result of a multi-year partnership between the Mets and Digital Domain.\n\nAt the end of the 2012 season, the Mets announced that Digital Domain would no longer own the naming rights to the ballpark, and that the stadium would temporarily be renamed Mets Stadium. On February 7, 2013, the Mets struck a new deal with Tradition, Florida, and the ballpark was once again called Tradition Field, the park's name from 2004 to 2009.\n\nOn February 23, 2017, the Mets announced a 10-year strategic partnership with First Data to rename the ballpark First Data Field. First Data's 2019 acquisition by Fiserv led in February 2020 to the ballpark being renamed Clover Park for the company's Clover point-of-sale-platform.\nThe Stadium featured several new amenities in 2012. The right field bleacher was replaced with 500 field-level seats, highlighted by an outdoor bar and grill similar to the third base-side Tiki Bar. The right field section was also connected to the outfield grass berm area for easy access throughout the facility. The scoreboard was upgraded to include a larger screen featuring replay highlights in HD.\n\nThe stadium was renovated for the 2020 Spring Training season. The improvements included new concessions, clubhouse, and additional outfield areas for spectators.\n\nSince opening, Clover Park has hosted the Florida State League All-Star Game a total of three times. The most recent time was in 2015, following the 1994 and 2004 editions of the exhibition game.\n\n"}

Steinbrenner Field (formerly known as Legends Field), is a baseball stadium located in Tampa, Florida across Dale Mabry Highway from Raymond James Stadium, home of the National Football League's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The ballpark was built in 1996 and holds 11,026 people with an addition in right field built in 2007. This ballpark is the largest spring training ballpark in Florida.\n\nGeorge M. Steinbrenner Field serves as the home of the Tampa Tarpons, the New York Yankees' affiliate in the Class A Advanced Florida State League, and is the Yankees' spring training home.\n\nTampa was the first spring training site in Florida, beginning in 1913 with the Chicago Cubs. In the ensuing decades, the city hosted several different Major League Baseball teams for spring training and was home to several different minor league squads during the summer, first at Plant Field near downtown and later at Al Lopez Field near West Tampa. This era came to an end in 1988 when, after almost 30 years in Tampa, the Cincinnati Reds moved to new training facilities in Plant City and transferred operation of the Tampa Tarpons, their local minor league affiliate in the Florida State League, to the Chicago White Sox. In 1989, the Tarpons moved to Sarasota and Al Lopez Field was razed, leaving the city with no professional baseball teams and no large baseball venue.\n\nIn 1993, the Tampa Sports Authority announced a deal to build a new spring training stadium for the New York Yankees, who had been conducting spring training in Fort Lauderdale. The original plan was to build the facility on the former site of Al Lopez Field, just south of old Tampa Stadium. However, due to objections from the Buccaneers, the new ballpark was instead built about a half-mile to the northwest, directly across Dale Mabry Highway from Tampa Stadium, displacing a Hillsborough County correctional facility.\n\nThe ballpark and the surrounding training complex cost approximately $30 million to build and was financed entirely with public funds, mostly from Hillsborough County. It hosted its first spring training game on March 1, 1996 when the Yankees opened spring training by hosting the Cleveland Indians.\n\nIn 2006, Hillsborough County paid for a $7.5 million expansion to add more seats and amenities behind right field. The addition opened in 2008.\n\nThe ballpark was known as Legends Field for the first dozen years of its existence. It was renamed in honor of George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner and Tampa resident, on March 27, 2008, when Steinbrenner was in failing health. He died in July 2010, and a life-size bronze statue of the late owner was placed in front of the stadium in January 2011.\n\nOn April 20, 2016, Hillsborough County commissioners approved a $40 million renovation of George M. Steinbrenner Field, greenlighting an agreement that will keep New York Yankees' spring training in Tampa through 2046. Renovations began after the 2016 season. Improvements included new seats throughout the 10,000-capacity ballpark, roof replacements, a better entry plaza and an upgraded outfield concourse. The renovations also included adding new amenities such as new loge boxes, cabanas, suite upgrades, a right-field beachside bar and bullpen clubs. The bullpen clubs will be installed on both the first base and the third base side. The clubs are composed of two levels; the top tier is exclusively for group tickets, club seat members and loge seating, while the bottom tier features a full bar that all ticket members can access. Additional shaded areas were constructed to protect fans from the sun. The team's spring training practice facility on Himes Avenue was also upgraded. The renovations were completed in time for Spring Training 2017.\n\nThe dimensions of the field precisely mimic that of both the old Yankee Stadium and the new Yankee Stadium, and the scalloped grandstand facade (the frieze) is also meant to invoke the old ballpark in the Bronx. When built, it was the first spring training stadium to include luxury suites. Outside of the stadium are plaques commemorating Yankees whose numbers have been retired.\n\nIn 2008, Barack Obama held a campaign rally at the ballpark with members of the Tampa Bay Rays, including David Price, who introduced him to the crowd.\n\nIn 2010, the ballpark was the home pitch for FC Tampa Bay of the USSF Division 2 Professional League. The club moved across Tampa Bay to Al Lang Field in St. Petersburg for the 2011 season.\n\nOn August 9, 2014, the venue hosted the \"Carnivores Tour\" featuring Linkin Park and Thirty Seconds to Mars along with AFI.\n\n"}

The stadium was built in 2004 and has a maximum seating capacity of 8,500 people (7,000 fixed seats with additional grass berm seating for 1,500).\n\nThe ballpark is the spring training home of the Philadelphia Phillies, and also the home of their Class A affiliate, the Clearwater Threshers of the Florida State League. A sculpture titled \"The Ace\"—by artist Kevin Brady—stands at the ballpark's west entrance plaza.\n\nThe stadium was originally named after the regional / national cable company, Bright House Networks, whose local head end center is located just to the south of the stadium.\n\nIt was announced on January 20, 2004, that Bright House Networks had secured the naming rights for the new ballpark. Under the terms of the agreement, Bright House Networks would pay the Phillies $1.7 million over 10 years with an option for two 5-year renewals. The City of Clearwater receives one-third of the payment.\n\nIn 2017, the complex was renamed Spectrum Field after Bright House was purchased by Charter Communications. While named for Charter's residential service, the name invoked memories of the Spectrum arena that operated from 1967 to 2009 at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, which the Phillies have called home since 1971.\n\nSpectrum Field is the Phillies' third Clearwater spring-training home. The team moved to Clearwater in 1947. They trained and played home games at Clearwater Athletic Field from 1947 to 1954. The City of Clearwater opened a new ballpark for spring training in 1955 and named it Jack Russell Stadium. (The ballpark was renamed Jack Russell Memorial Stadium in 1990.) With the stadium aging, the Phillies and the city erected their new spring home adjacent to the Phillies' year-round training facility, the Carpenter Complex, four-miles east of Jack Russell Memorial Stadium.\n\nGround-breaking of the new stadium took place on October 16, 2002. The official ribbon-cutting ceremony for the ballpark took place on February 27, 2004 prior to the annual spring-training Phan Fest.\n\nOn June 24, 2012, thanks to the rain bands off Tropical Storm Debby, the field was flooded, becoming swimming pool-like.\n\nThe Phillies played their first spring-training game at the park on March 4, 2004. 8,205 fans watched the Phils beat the New York Yankees 5–1. Vicente Padilla started for the Phillies, Marlon Byrd had the park's first hit, and Jimmy Rollins hit the first home run.\n\nSpectrum Field hosted the 44th Florida State League All-Star Game on June 18, 2005. A crowd of 5,547 saw the West defeat the East 6–4. The Sarasota Reds' Chris Dickerson hit a two-run home run, scored two runs, and earned the game's Star of Stars Award. Future major league players who appeared in the game included Dickeron, Reggie Abercrombie, Carlos Villanueva, and Sean Marshall.\n\nThreshers pitcher Julio De La Cruz pitched the first no-hitter at the ballpark on August 18, 2006. De La Cruz beat the Sarasota Reds 5–0 in front of 5,906 fans on \"Pitch for Pink Night\" in Clearwater. The Threshers wore special pink uniforms to raise money for breast cancer research and awareness. It was the first no-hitter for Clearwater since 1992.\n\nThe Big East Conference held its championship tournament at Spectrum Field in 2006 and from 2008 to 2013. Notre Dame defeated Louisville 7–0 on May 27, 2006, to win the 2006 championship. Louisville defeated Cincinnati 6–3 to win the 2008 championship on May 24, 2008. In 2009, Louisville again won the tournament. In 2010, St. John's won the title, defeating UConn 3–0 in the championship game. In 2011, 5th-seeded Seton Hall became the lowest seeded team ever to win the Big East Tournament, defeating St. John's 4–2. In 2012, St. John's defeated South Florida 7–3 in the title game to win the tournament. Beginning in 2014, the American Athletic Conference has held its conference baseball tournament at Spectrum Field.\n\nThe single-game attendance record for the Threshers was set on July 3, 2015, when 9,966 saw Clearwater defeat the Tampa Yankees, 3-0. Since 2007, the top 6 of the Threshers top 10 single-game attendance numbers occurred on July 3.\n\nThe all time spring training attendance record for Spectrum Field was set on March 17, 2019 when 11,340 saw the Yankees defeat the Phillies 7-3.\n\nThe spring-training attendance mark for Spectrum Field is 143,500, set in 2009.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1922866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922866", "title": "Harder Stadium", "text": "Harder Stadium\n\nHarder Stadium is a 17,000 seat, outdoor multi-purpose stadium on the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara in Santa Barbara, California. It serves as the on-campus soccer stadium for both the men's and women's programs. It is also currently used occasionally by the university's club rugby and lacrosse teams and previously served as the home for the football team.\n\nThe stadium was built in 1966 and is named after Theodore \"Spud\" Harder, a former coach of the Gauchos' football team. It hosted Vince Lombardi and the Green Bay Packers who trained there ahead of the 1967 Super Bowl. The UC-Santa Barbara football team played their home games at Harder Stadium until football was cut after the 1971 season due to budget cuts. UCSB brought football back as a non-scholarship sport in 1983 and by 1987 was playing a full Division II and III schedule. In 1992, the NCAA ruled that Division I colleges must play at the Division I level in all sports; UCSB and a few other universities attempted to form a non-scholarship Division I-AAA level, but the effort failed and UCSB eventually dropped football. The stadium has a capacity of 17,000 people, and currently is the largest stadium on California's Central Coast. Along with the UCSB Events Center, it is one of the more well-attended athletic venues in the Central Coast.\n\nHarder Stadium hosted a memorial service for the victims of the 2014 Isla Vista Killings. Guests in attendance included UC President Janet Napolitano, and over 20,000 students, staff, alumni, and community members. The stadium seats were filled over capacity as thousands more sat on the grass field.\n\nHarder Stadium sees most of its present-day use as a soccer stadium to the UCSB men's soccer and women's soccer teams. The stadium hosted the final three matches of the 2010 College Cup. However, a number of professional club and international teams have played in Harder Stadium as well.\n\nDue to the success of the men's program, the stadium has hosted numerous NCAA soccer playoff games in addition to the regular season games. Despite the men's program recent success, it was the women's program who first brought the NCAA Tournaments to Harder Stadium. The women hosted the first soccer NCAA Tournament game in a 1985 4-3 victory against Cal State Hayward. In total, the women's program has held 4 NCAA Tournament matches at Harder Stadium, bringing such opponents as the Wisconsin Badgers, Stanford Cardinal, and Hartford Hawks.\n\nThe men's program hosted their first men's NCAA Tournament game in 2002, blanking the San Diego Toreros 2-0. In total, they have hosted 9 NCAA Tournament games.\n\nIn 2004, 11,214 fans saw UCSB defeat Virginia Commonwealth 4-1 to reach the College Cup (NCAA Soccer's \"Final Four\"). After the game, a group of students celebrated by carrying one of the soccer goals out of the stadium. They had planned to throw it into the Pacific Ocean (about 1/3 mile away), but were stopped by a combination of law enforcement down the block and tiring out from the weight of the goal.\n\nHowever, in 2006, the UCSB won the 2006 Division I Men's College Cup in St. Louis, Missouri. Meanwhile, 2,000 miles away at Harder Stadium, a group of rowdy students marched down to the stadium from their homes and attempted the same feat. This time the group succeeded in their quest, throwing the soccer goal off of a cliff at the beginning of the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive.\n\nIn 2009, the NCAA awarded UCSB and Harder Stadium the 2010 Division I Men's College Cup, which is the \"Final Four\" of Division I men's soccer.\n\nOn September 24, 2010, the UCSB gaucho fans set a record on the highest attendance at any NCAA (on campus) soccer match. UCSB beat the visiting UCLA team (2-0) in front of 15,896 who attended the game.\n\nAdditional UCSB teams that use the stadium for select contests are the UCSB women's lacrosse, men's lacrosse and rugby teams. These teams are part of the UCSB Recreation Department and open to all students.\n\nDue to the large capacity of Harder Stadium, it is often used by professional teams exhibition games. In 1991, the US Women's National Team played there before the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. Likewise, the US Men's National Team played there in 1994 against the Romanian National Team.\n\nClub teams also have played at Harder Stadium. In March 2004, the San Jose Earthquakes and Los Angeles Galaxy played a pre-season exhibition in Santa Barbara. Following the success of MLS teams at Harder, in March 2006 & 2007, the UC Santa Barbara men's team played exhibition matches against the Columbus Crew while in July 2006, Cruz Azul and Los Angeles Galaxy played. March 2007 also saw Shizuoka Sangyō University of Japan played off against UCSB. March 2009 saw Club América and Monarcas Morelia played, while UCSB has scheduled to play the Mexican U-17 National Team.\n\nEvery year, the school's Associated Students Program Board have thrown a free day-long party, known as EXTRAVAGANZA, at Harder Stadium. Previous bands to have played at the festival include Sublime, No Doubt, Jack Johnson, T.I., Run-D.M.C., Coolio, Busta Rhymes, The Black Eyed Peas, Jane's Addiction, MxPx, Social Distortion, Eve 6, Pepper, Slightly Stoopid, Ludacris, Nas, Hellogoodbye, and E-40.\n\nHarder Stadium also houses 18 art studios located beneath the seating risers. They are primarily used by graduate students and faculty.\n\n"}
{"id": "1922867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922867", "title": "LECOM Park", "text": "LECOM Park\n\nLECOM Park is a baseball field located in Bradenton, Florida. It is the spring training home of the Pittsburgh Pirates and is named after a 15-year naming rights deal was signed with the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, which has its main campus in Erie, Pennsylvania, and also a campus in Bradenton. It was formerly known as McKechnie Field, named for Bradenton resident and Baseball Hall of Fame great Bill McKechnie, who led the Pirates in 1925 and the Cincinnati Reds in 1940 to World Series titles. He was also a coach with the Cleveland Indians in 1948. \n\nSeveral members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, such as Bert Blyleven, Roberto Clemente, Willie Stargell, Bill Mazeroski, Roberto Alomar, Wade Boggs, Roy Halladay, Jack Morris, Mariano Rivera, Ivan Rodriguez, Babe Ruth, Mike Schmidt and Ted Williams, have played at LECOM Park. \n\nThe stadium also hosts minor league baseball games for the Bradenton Marauders, the Pirates' High-A club in the Florida State League.\n\nLECOM Park's nostalgic charms in its city neighborhood appeal to many baseball traditionalists and ballpark enthusiasts, some of whom consider the facility to be Florida's version of Fenway Park. It is built in a Florida Spanish Mission style, with white stucco on the main grandstand and covered bleachers over the reserved seating section. The Pirates and the City of Bradenton celebrated their 40th anniversary together during the 2008 spring training season, which included an agreement between the city and the Pirates to continue their partnership through 2037.\n\nThe field is the oldest stadium still used for spring training as well as the second-oldest in the Florida State League (behind Jackie Robinson Ballpark in Daytona Beach, built in 1914). It is also the third oldest stadium currently used by a major league team after Fenway Park, built in , and Wrigley Field in 1914.\n\nThe stadium hosted an annual charity game between the Pirates and the State College of Florida, Manatee–Sarasota. \n\nSeveral improvements to the field were made possible through the efforts of the Bradenton Boosters, a volunteer club of local residents that not only raises funds for ballpark improvements, but also operate LECOM Park on game day. Since 1979, members of the Boosters have volunteered as the Pirates spring training game-day staff. The booster club's 120 members currently serve as ushers, program sellers, security personnel, merchandise sellers, and press box attendants throughout spring training season.\n\nPrior to its construction, the stadium's location was the site of Ninth Street Park, which was used by the Bradenton Growers of the Florida State League. The site was also the home to the Manatee County fairgrounds as well as a local nine-hole golf course.\n\nOn December 9, 1920, the Manatee County Board of Trade voted to bring major league baseball to the county in an attempt to stimulate the local economy. Prior to the 1920s, no major league team played south of St. Petersburg. However, Robert M. Beall Sr., the founder of the Bradenton-based department store, Bealls, as well as the team president and majority owner of the Bradenton Growers, was connected to Sam Breadon, the owner of the St. Louis Cardinals. Breadon also owned a citrus grove inside the county and was familiar with the area. Beall convinced Breadon to move the Cardinals from their training facility in Orange, Texas to Bradenton. As part of the agreement, Beall agreed to sell $2,000 in tickets for the exhibition games. In a joint venture between the Cardinals and the city, the ball field was constructed with a grandstand and bleachers for $2,000. The baseball field was just east of where LECOM Park stands today, on the site of the Bradenton Golf Club, a nine-hole golf course. After completion, city engineers discovered that the field's second base, was lower than home plate, and the outfield was even lower than second base.\n\nHowever, the park opened in 1923. The Commissioner of Baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, attended the field's opening ceremonies. He was flown in on a biplane, which was piloted by Harry Land, a member of Manatee County Board of Trade who approved bringing major league baseball to Bradenton. The plane landed in what was the outfield at the time, a par 5 hole. In 1923, the grandstand sat 1,300 and 700 could easily occupy the bleachers, which included separate facilities for segregated African-American fans. Meanwhile, the fairground buildings were converted into makeshift locker rooms.\n\nThe Bradenton Growers occupied LECOM Park, which was then named City Park, from 1923 to 1924 and again in 1926. The field was later renamed Ninth Street Park and then Braves Field.\n\nThe Cardinals played in Bradenton in the very next season, before leaving for Stockton, California, in . However, they were replaced by the Philadelphia Phillies, who played in the park until , until they left for Winter Haven. In 1928, the Boston Red Sox were looking at coming to Bradenton, after spending the prior three years training in New Orleans. However, before the team would commit to the Bradenton, the Red Sox officials asked to see the attendance and financial figures of what they would see if they moved their training to Bradenton. Robert M. Beall Sr. gave the Red Sox the actual figures they requested. The Boston officials were impressed with Beall's honesty. Every other city competing for the Red Sox had given the club projected figures on what they might expect if they choose their city, not their actual figures. The Red Sox trained in Bradenton until . That season the Cardinals returned to Bradenton and would stay there for the next seven springs.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Cardinals returned during what journalists refer to as \"the gashouse gang era\". During that time they had a lot of great ball players, including Paul Derringer and future-Hall of Famer Dizzy Dean. Dean, who played at the stadium in the 1930s, liked Bradenton so much, he bought a local gas station and hung out there when he wasn't playing, giving the Cardinals' famed Gashouse Gang its nickname. Dean also bought a home in Bradenton. To keep him out of trouble, the Cardinals sent him to Bradenton weeks before spring training, and paid a local sportswriter to keep an eye on him. In the Cardinals moved their training to City Island Ball Park, located in Daytona Beach.\n\nThe Boston Bees (today's Atlanta Braves) played at the stadium until , when they left for San Antonio, Texas. The stadium did not host another team for seven years.\n\nDuring World War II, many major league teams avoided the long trip to Florida for training, opting instead to hold their sessions closer to their home cities to cut down on costs. The United States military used the field as a training base from 1941 to 1945. The base was first named Camp Bradenton. However the name was later changed in 1943 to Camp Weatherford, in honor of Pfc. Willie Weatherford, who was the first Florida native killed in the war. The baseball field was filled with temporary buildings and tents and used as a United States Army Signal Corps training facility. The offices of the city's Public Works Department are next to the ballpark on land that was also part of the camp. The camp was attached to Drew Army Airfield, located in Tampa. When the war ended, that airfield became the Tampa International Airport. Meanwhile, the Camp Weatherford location was used once again for baseball. An historical marker now stands between the city offices and the stadium.\n\nIn , Lou Perini, the owner of the Boston Braves (later renamed the Milwaukee Braves/Atlanta Braves) moved his club's spring training to Bradenton, after finding his club's training facility in Fort Lauderdale too windy. The Braves played in Bradenton for one year, however the city stated that if the Braves agreed to return the very next season, the city would build new clubhouses, field boxes along the first and third baselines and a new press box. The Braves agreed and stayed in Bradenton until . The Braves won three National League pennants while they trained there in 1948, 1957 and 1958, and won the 1957 World Series. In the Braves moved from Boston to Milwaukee, but kept playing spring ball in Bradenton. Future Hall of famer, Hank Aaron played his first games in the major leagues in Bradenton as a rookie in 1954.\n\nIn , Bradenton became the first club to allow an African-American baseball player, Sam Jethroe of the Boston Braves. This was a major breakthrough because had Florida not allowed him to join, the state would have lost all of its baseball clubs. In 1962, the stadium was finally renamed after Bradenton-native, Bill McKechnie, in honor of his induction that year into the Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager.\n\nHowever, after the spring training session, Lou Perini moved the Braves to Connie Mack Field, after spending $1 million on a development in West Palm Beach. The city scrambled to get a new major league team into McKechnie Field. The city and the Philadelphia Phillies almost landed in Bradenton, however city officials in Clearwater fixed several of the issues that the Phillies were unhappy about at Jack Russell Stadium. That same year the field was formally named McKechnie Field.\n\nThe Kansas City Athletics played at McKechnie Field from 1963–1968. Ironically, the team left Connie Mack Field for Bradenton, after the Milwaukee Braves arrived in West Palm Beach. The team was not open to sharing their spring training facilities or stadium with the Braves. The City of Bradenton talked A's owner Charlie Finley into staying at McKechnie until . By that time, the A's relocated from Kansas City to Oakland. Finley believed that his west coast team should train on the west coast, in Mesa, Arizona. During the Athletics tenure, Finley routinely tied his Athletics team mascot, a donkey named \"Charlie O\", to a tree inside the stadium during games.\"\n\nOnce the Athletics left Florida for the west coast, Bradenton made plans to attract a new major league club. The city would attempt to lure the Pittsburgh Pirates or the Cleveland Indians to McKechnie Field. At the time, the Indians had a ten-year contract to play at Randolph Field, located in Tucson, Arizona and were written off by Bradenton officials. However the Pirates were unhappy at Terry Park, their spring training home for 14 years, located in Fort Myers. In February 1968, Bradenton representatives met with Pirates' general manager Joe Brown and owner John W. Galbreath and both sides agreed to a lease of 40 years, with an option for another 40 years. In 1969 the Pittsburgh Pirates began their lease of McKechnie Field. Still the team threatened to move several times in the first 34 years they'd been there.\n\nPrior to 1993, the playing field at McKechnie was much less popular with the players than it is today. Whitey Herzog, the Kansas City Royals manager in the late 1970s, called it \"the closest thing to a cow pasture I've seen.\" Pirate outfielder Dave Parker later stated that \"playing in the outfield [at McKechnie] was like playing in a \"potato patch\".\" This led the city to finally install new grass and build new clubhouses, a grandstand and a press box in the 1980s. But McKechnie was still the oldest spring training facility in Florida, so city officials agreed to give the Pirates a renovated stadium to make sure they would stay.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, many teams began renovating their spring training sites. At this time, the Pirates were threatening to leave Bradenton for Winter Haven in search of better training facilities. Many of the complaints that were associated with the pre-1993 ballpark included red sand that clotted the infield, old boards serving as bleacher seats and panels hanging loose on the outfield walls. The city then stepped in with a plan to use tourism tax money to rebuild McKechnie Field. The project ended up costing $3.4 million.\n\nIn 1993 it was decided that the aging stadium was in need of a massive renovation. Pittsburgh-based architect, Lou Astorino, of L.D. Astorino Companies, was put in charge of renovating the ballpark. Astorino's renovation was inspired by Forbes Field, the Pirates' old stadium in Pittsburgh, with its outfield walls that were covered in ivy, like Wrigley Field, and the view of trees outside the park. He also chose a Spanish Mission façade based on the old Bradenton railroad station. The Pirates and local officials agreed that any renovation must preserve the neighborhood appeal of McKechnie.\n\nAfter extensive interviews and months of work, an intimate park was recommended with new grounds, wide access ramps, concession stands, kiosks and improved sight lines, while maintaining a ballpark's classic ambiance. McKechnie's old metal chairs that served as box seats and the wooden bleachers were also removed, in favor of more modern stadium seating. The grandstand seen today at McKechnie was built as part of the 1993 renovation and holds 6,602 people. Construction on the new park started in late 1992, and was barely completed by spring training 1993. Workers were still putting numbers on the stadium seats while the Manatee High School band played just minutes before the first pitch on March 5.\n\nThe stadium's remodeling was applauded highly by Pulitzer Prize-winning author and essayist George Will for keeping the vintage baseball park look. Will was also a part-owner of the Pirates' opponents for their first game in the renovated park, the Baltimore Orioles and was in attendance. The renovation to the Spanish mission-style ballpark preserved the intimate, old-time atmosphere so well that \"USA Today\" dubbed it the \"Fenway Park\" of spring training stadiums. As part of the renovation the red infield dirt was replaced with a darker color dirt because Pirates' manager Jim Leyland complained of the glare and heat reflecting from the reddish sand.\n\nLou Astorino subsequently designed PNC Park, which became the Pirates' regular season home in .\n\nIn 2008, the Pirates unveiled a commemorative logo celebrating their 40th anniversary of Spring training in Bradenton, Florida. The logo was symbolic of the club's long-term relationship with the city. The patch displayed classic Pirates \"P\" on the historical façade outline of McKechnie Field. The Pirates displayed the logo throughout Spring training on a large billboard just behind the right-center field wall at McKechnie, as well as on the Pirates Spring training jerseys. The Pirates tenure in Bradenton (44 years) ranks third in longevity among teams that currently hold Spring training in Florida. Only the Detroit Tigers in Lakeland (65 years), and the Philadelphia Phillies in Clearwater (64 years) have been in their Spring training locations longer.\n\nThe renovations prior to the 2008 Spring training season included a new visitor's clubhouse, a new press lounge and lights. Improvements also included a renovation of Pirate City, the team's southern headquarters, with new offices, player dormitories and a fifth practice field. The work was partly funded by the state, which wants to prevent any more major league teams from migrating to the Cactus League in Arizona for spring training.\n\nFor the first 85 years no night games were played at the ballpark. However, lights were installed and the stadium hosted its first night game in 2008. Since the first night game was played at Wrigley Field in , McKechnie had been the only ballpark used by a major league team at any time of the year that lacked lights. The Pirates have always played a handful of night exhibition games each year, but never at McKechnie. Previously, the Pirates never saw the need for lights at McKechnie, and never pushed for them. Players and team officials have long been comfortable with the routine of arriving early in the morning, getting in a day's workouts and a ballgame, then enjoying a leisurely dinner at night. However, the lack of lights meant McKechnie Field could only be used for Spring training games and the facility sat empty 11 months a year.\n\nThe installation of lights was made possible after the city of Bradenton received a $15 million grant from the state of Florida to upgrade the field. The grant fund was set up to prevent any more major league teams from migrating to the Cactus League in Arizona for Spring training. Besides the lights, the grant money paid for a new visitor's clubhouse and an expanded home clubhouse. A lighted McKechnie Field allows for night baseball and other events, enabling the city to use the ballpark as a catalyst in an area where officials envision an entertainment district.\n\nThe first night game at McKechnie was originally scheduled for March 7 as the Pirates took on the Cincinnati Reds but the game was rained out. Instead the ballpark's first night game was played on March 19, 2008. The game resulted in a Pirates loss to the New York Yankees, 12–9.\n\nBecause of the improvements, the Pirates signed a new 30-year lease that went into effect on February 1, 2008. The team is now guaranteed to play at McKechnie Field through 2037, and after playing two night games in Bradenton in 2008 the Pirates will have many more opportunities to play under the lights over the next few decades. Pirates' alumni Bill Virdon and Chuck Tanner have both disagreed on the need for lights, stating their opinion that spring training games were meant to be held in the daytime. However the lights would be key to the stadium landing a new minor league team a few years later.\n\nMcKechnie Field did not host a Florida State League team, since the end of Bradenton Growers era, from 1926 until 2010. From 1989–1990, the Bradenton Explorers of the Senior Professional Baseball Association played at McKechnie. The Pirates' Rookie Level minor league affiliate, the Gulf Coast Pirates, formerly the Bradenton Pirates, currently play their games at the Pirates training facility in Bradenton's Pirate City complex. However, on November 10, 2009, baseball officials voted to allow the Pirates to purchase and uproot the Cincinnati Reds' Class A affiliate, the Sarasota Reds. The team was renamed the Bradenton Marauders and play all of its home games at McKechnie Field. In return the Reds received the Pirates Class A team, the Lynchburg Hillcats. The new Bradenton team began play on April 7, 2010. The inaugural game ended in 18-3 Bradenton victory over the Fort Myers Miracle.\n\nIn early 2012, Bradenton officials planned to make a $7.5 million loan to pay for \"fan-friendly\" renovations to McKechnie Field. The proposed upgrades included new seating, enhanced fan plazas, a boardwalk that would circumnavigate the stadium, a tiki bar, more concession stands, restroom improvements, an upgraded sound system and scoreboard. To pay for the ballpark renovations, the city planned to take out a 20-year loan, repaying it primarily from the county's \"bed tax\", which visitors pay when they stay at a hotel or resort located in Manatee County. Under the deal, the Pittsburgh Pirates, who contributed the equivalent of $150,000 annually to market the city of Bradenton, planned to increase their marketing donation to $400,000 annually. That money was then to be used to promote tourism in the county. The renovations also allowed McKechnie Field to host sports events, such as high school regional tournaments.\n\nOn February 7, 2012, Manatee County commissioners Tuesday agreed to an interlocal agreement that will provide McKechnie Field with the $7.5 million in renovations. The project was slated to begin after the Pirates’ 2012 spring training season and will continue around the Marauders’ 2012 schedule. Improvements could be completed prior to the 2013 spring training season. The renovations will allow for the metal roof that sits over the grandstand area to be repaired. In 2011, the metal ceilings that occupied McKechnie had to be removed because of corrosion. The removal forced two Marauders home games to be relocated to Port Charlotte. Temporary awnings were put in place for the upcoming 2012 season. Construction of a new, permanent roof was planned and completed in 2013. On August 16, 2012, the Pirates announced the team would contribute an additional $2 million to $3 million for the renovations to McKechnie Field, increasing total enhancement costs for their Bradenton Spring training home from 7.5 million to approximately $10 million.\n\nThe design and construction for the renovations were performed by Fawley Bryant Architects and NDC Construction, both Manatee County businesses. The renovated ballpark was unveiled to the media on February 20, 2013. The changes come on the anniversaries of McKechnie's 90th year in existence, as well as the Pirates' 45th year at the stadium. With the changes, McKechnie became the fourth largest capacity venue in the Grapefruit League.\n\nFor both aesthetic and business reasons, McKechnie Field was chosen as the Best Ballpark Renovation, in the Over $1 Million category, of 2013 by \"Ballpark Digest\", the leading guide to baseball and ballparks on the Internet.\n\nMcKechnie Field hosted the 2014 Florida State League All-Star Game on Saturday, June 14, 2014. The Marauders were represented in the game by outfielder Josh Bell and left-handed pitcher Orlando Castro. The attendance of 5,882 fans for the game was the highest for the league's All-Star Game since 2006 and it was also the 3rd highest attendance in the All-Star Game's 53-year history.\n\nIn February 2015, the Pirates opened and began using a brand-new 22,500-square-foot facility at the ballpark. According to Trevor Gooby, the director of Florida Operations for the Pirates, \"McKechnie was built in 1923, and the clubhouse was probably built right after the stadium was built, so it was the oldest part of McKechnie Field\". The walls have the numbers of retired players and dates of victorious championships. There is also a quote from Pirates' legend Roberto Clemente located in the locker room area that reads: \"When I put on my uniform, I feel I am the proudest man on earth.\" Other areas of the building contain a weight room, rehab center and two hydrogen pools. The $6.5 million facility was funded by the Pirates. In 2016, with over 12,000 individuals voting, readers of \"Ballpark Digest\" and \"Spring Training Online\" overwhelmingly chose McKechnie Field as the leading Grapefruit League spring-training facility in the website's annual Best of the Ballparks polling. The stadium repeated as top Spring park in Florida the following season and set a new Spring training attendance record of 106,291 over 17 games.\n\nMcKechnie Field was used as the site for each game of the 2016 Florida State League Championship series between the Marauders and the Tampa Yankees due to construction at the Yankees' stadium, Steinbrenner Field. The Marauders defeated the Yankees, in 4 games to win their first Florida State League title.\n\nOn February 10, 2017, it was announced the Pirates and the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine had reached a naming rights deal, renaming the venue LECOM Park. To continue the homage to Bill McKechnie, the home clubhouse was renamed the Bill McKechnie Home Clubhouse.\n\nThe stadium was named McKechnie Field in 1962 in honor of the former Pirates manager Bill McKechnie. However, due to a deal made with Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, the Pittsburgh Pirates organization renamed the stadium to LECOM Park in 2017. While the city of Bradenton owns the stadium, the decision to rename McKechnie Field as LECOM Park was at the sole discretion of the Pirates. Under a lease signed in 2008, the Pirates retained the naming rights for the stadium. None of the revenue from the deal will accrue to the city.\n\nDuring the news conference to announce the new name, Bradenton mayor Wayne Poston said his office “was coming up empty” trying to contact Bill McKechnie's relatives. However, according to Bill McKechnie's last living daughter, Carol Montgomery, the Pirates made no effort to notify her of the stadium's name change. According to Montgomery, “[I] was very surprised and really pretty miffed, ticked off that I wasn’t contacted,” Montgomery said. “I had no input on it whatsoever and no one from my family did.” She can't understand how the franchise couldn't track her down. Three years ago, she threw out the first pitch at a spring training game at the park in conjunction with a tour to promote her book “The Deacon’s Daughter.” Although the Pirates named their home clubhouse at the stadium after McKechnie to honor his legacy, his daughter still referred to the deal \"as a slap in the face\".\n\nThe accusation forced the Pirates to admit that their efforts to find surviving family members fell short and issued a formal apology. The press release stated: “Our intent was to locate any family members living in the area to discuss with them the partnership opportunity that we were pursuing that would include the naming rights to the ballpark. We wanted Bill McKechnie’s surviving family members to know that it was important to us that we continue to honor Bill’s legacy by naming the home clubhouse after him, as well as affixing a permanent plaque that would inform our fans for years to come of Bill’s Hall of Fame career. Regrettably, our efforts to find Bill’s surviving relatives fell short, and there is not an acceptable reason for that. We regret the fact that we did not inform Mrs. Montgomery of the name change in advance of the announcement.\"\n\nThe name-change proved to be unpopular with fans and the media. The \"Sarasota Herald-Tribune\" wrote that while LECOM has campuses in both Pennsylvania and Bradenton, the name change was purely financial and \"foul\". An \"NBC Sports\" editorial urged the spectators at LECOM Park to keep calling the stadium McKechnie Field. They argued that \"The Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine isn’t paying you or me any money, are they? What’s more, calling it LECOM Park is more likely to confuse people than enlighten them, at least for many, many years. Unless and until it becomes more misleading and confusing to refer to it as McKechnie Field than LECOM Park, people should still call it McKechnie Field.\"\n\nIn 1989, for his book \"Spring Training,\" author William Zinsser chose McKechnie Field as a classic Florida baseball setting. McKechnie Field was also used as a backdrop for the 1987 HBO movie \"Long Gone\".\n\n"}

He is a former member of the Minnesota Senate from Fort Ripley. A Republican, he represented District 12, which includes all or portions of Crow Wing and Morrison counties, including the city of Brainerd. A liquor store owner, funeral car service owner, and small farmer, he served two terms, but was defeated by former Rep. Paul Gazelka in the August 10, 2010, Republican primary election. He was elected to the Crow Wing County Board in 2012 and re-elected unopposed in 2016; he represents the first district which contains the southern portion of Crow Wing County, including Fort Ripley, Roosevelt Township, Oak Lawn Township and the extreme northeast portion of the city of Brainerd.\n\nKoering was first elected to the senate in 2002, defeating longtime senator and Democrat Don Samuelson, who had been the senate president. He was re-elected in 2006, overcoming both primary and general election opponents.\n\nKoering was a member of the senate's Agriculture and Veterans Committee, the Capital Investment Committee, the Health, Housing and Family Security Committee (on which he was the ranking minority party member), and the Higher Education Committee. He also served on the Finance subcommittees for the Agriculture and Veterans Budget and Policy Division, for the Health and Human Services Budget Division, and for the Higher Education Budget and Policy Division.\n\nKoering's positions tended to be conservative, including opposition to tax increases, opposition to abortion, support for tougher criminal sentences, and support for broad gun rights, including support for a general right to carry a concealed firearm. In a notable exception to that conservatism, he has sided with Senate Democrats in opposing restrictions on gay rights. He is believed to be the first openly gay Republican elected official in Minnesota, and was the only openly gay Republican member of the Minnesota Legislature to date.\n\nKoering effectively 'outed' himself by breaking from the Republican Party line on a procedural vote in the Minnesota Senate. The pivotal moment came on April 7, 2005, when then-State Senator Michele Bachmann used procedural tactics that would have forced a vote on her constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in Minnesota. This vote coincided with the gay and lesbian \"justFair\" lobby day at the Capitol, as well as the second anniversary of the death of Koering's mother. Koering explicitly stated his sexual orientation a week later. Some public commentary questioned how this disclosure would affect his prospects for re-election in 2006 in a rural, right-leaning district, but he won by over 12 percentage points. However, he disappointed pro-same-sex marriage advocates by voting against the Minnesota Marriage and Family Protection Act, a DFL-backed proposal to legalize same-sex civil unions in the state.\n\nOn June 15, 2010, gay news site TheSword.com stated that Koering went on a dinner date in Brainerd with gay pornographic actor Brandon Wilde. He admitted to the date with Wilde and told The Sword, \"I don't see anything wrong with going out with him.\" In light of the story, the Minnesota Republican Party further distanced themselves from Koering. After losing the August 2010 primary election to Tea Party movement-backed candidate Paul Gazelka by a vote of 57 to 43 percent, he announced his withdrawal from the Republican Party, backing DFL Party candidate Taylor Stevenson's bid for the District 12 seat.\n\nKoering drew national criticism for his comments regarding people who have died from drug overdose. He was quoted by the Brainerd Dispatch as saying, “I don’t know why we’re in such a big hurry to save somebody like this. I guess it sounds kind of harsh, but it kind of gets rid of a problem, in my mind,” during the March 19, 2019 Crow Wing County Board meeting.\n\n"}

The stadium was built in 1990 and holds 8,500 people. It is the spring training home of the Toronto Blue Jays, as well as home to the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Class A Florida State League and the Dunedin High School Falcons baseball team. The stadium has also been known as Knology Park (2004–2008) and Florida Auto Exchange Stadium (2010–2017).\n\nFrom 1977 to 1989, the Blue Jays played at Grant Field, which had a seating capacity of 3,417. Grant Field opened in 1930 and was named after the mayor of Dunedin Albert J. Grant (served 1927–1928), who had donated the land. The first Toronto Blue Jays game ever was played there on March 11, 1977 when the Blue Jays beat the New York Mets 3–1.\n\nIn 1990, at a cost of approximately $2.4 million, the City of Dunedin built a new stadium called Dunedin Stadium at the same location as Grant Field. It had a capacity of 6,106. The actual playing field and team clubhouses did not change.\n\nIn the fall of 2000, the Toronto Blue Jays signed an agreement to remain in Dunedin for an additional 15 years pending a $12-million renovation. The state of Florida paid $6 million, Pinellas County $3 million, and the Jays and Dunedin paid the remainder for the renovations. The agreement took effect in March 2002. Part of the renovations have included a new two-story building that includes a clubhouse, training room, weight room, and office space that was built next to the stadium. The most recent renovations at Dunedin Stadium include remodeled restrooms and replacement of the grandstand seats.\n\nIn February 1995, during the Major League Baseball strike, the Blue Jays considered holding regular season games at Dunedin Stadium if the regular season began with replacement players. Ontario law forbade the Blue Jays from using replacement players in Toronto. American League officials inspected the ballpark on February 21, 1995 in response to the club's request to host games in Dunedin. The strike ended in March 1995 and no regular season games were played at the park.\n\nDunedin Stadium was once ranked by Sports Illustrated as one of the top five facilities to watch a Major League Baseball Spring training game. Dunedin has been the only spring home for the Toronto Blue Jays since their inception in 1977.\n\nThe current park capacity is 5,509 individual seats and features include a press box level with air-conditioned skyboxes, three picnic areas, two air-conditioned rooms, a scoreboard with electronic message display, regulation-sized Major League playing field and lighting, two half-fields (one natural grass and one artificial turf), batting tunnels, and full concession capabilities. In addition, the administrative offices feature an executive boardroom, dining room and kitchen, classroom, clubhouse and workout and training facilities.\n\nThe Blue Jays lease of the facility ran through 2017; however, they held the option to extend it by an additional five years twice. After investigating possible alternative sites to host their spring training facility, the team negotiated an $81 million renovation to the stadium ($33.3 million) and Englebert Complex ($47.8 million) in 2014 under which they would contribute $20 million (plus any cost overruns) with the rest coming from the state ($13.7 million), county ($41.7 million) and city ($5.6 million) governments. The club retains all revenue from sales at concessions and parking at the stadium, while they share revenue from naming rights with the city. The new lease agreement for the stadium lasts for 25 years, with the option to renew for a further 2 years five times. The City Commission approved the deal in November 2017, while the county agreed to approve a funding request for the project in April 2018. By September 2019 the budget for the renovation had increased to $102 million, with the team investing an extra $20 million and the city contributing $530,000.\n\nGroundbreaking took place in April 2019, with the project scheduled to be completed in time for the Jays' 2020 spring training. The stadium's capacity will be expanded from 5,500 to 8,500, with 6,500 fixed seats.\n\nBeginning in 2004 the stadium was known as Knology Park as part of a naming agreement with Knology, a southeastern United States communications and entertainment company. This agreement expired on September 30, 2008.\n\nOn November 7, 2010, the City of Dunedin announced that it had reached a 7-year, $181,000 agreement with the Florida Auto Exchange, a Dunedin car sales center, for the naming rights of Dunedin Stadium. The facility was renamed \"Florida Auto Exchange Stadium\" until October 1, 2017 when the agreement expired.\n\nIn November 2019, the Jays announced that TD Bank had acquired naming rights for the renovated stadium, which would be renamed TD Ballpark.\n\n"}

{"id": "1922874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922874", "title": "Hi Corbett Field", "text": "Hi Corbett Field\n\nHi Corbett Field is a baseball stadium located in Tucson, Arizona. The stadium holds approximately 9,500 people. It was the spring training home of the Colorado Rockies and Cleveland Indians, and is currently home to the Arizona Wildcats baseball team.\n\nFirst teams played at the field in 1937. Hi Corbett Field was originally called Randolph Municipal Baseball Park. In 1951, it was renamed in honor of Hiram Stevens Corbett (1886–1967), a former Arizona state senator who was instrumental in bringing spring training to Tucson, specifically by convincing Bill Veeck to bring the Cleveland Indians to Tucson in 1947. Veeck owned a ranch in Tucson at the time, and he and players sometimes rode Veeck's horses after the games. Veeck claimed that he moved the team's training camp from Florida to Arizona in order to avoid Florida's Jim Crow laws.\n\nHi Corbett was remodeled in 1972 and renovated in 1992, 1997, 1999, and 2012. It is part of a larger city park complex, Gene C. Reid Park (which also includes the Reid Park Zoo) and Randolph Park, located between Broadway Boulevard and 22nd Street in midtown Tucson.\n\nThe main playing field's dimensions are as follows: 349 feet in Right Field, 366 feet in Left Field, and 410 feet at its deepest in Center Field. The ballpark currently has a capacity of 9,500, including 598 box seats, 8,350 reserved seats, and 562 bleacher seats. There are also two ancillary fields for use in spring training, but these make no provision for spectators.\n\nFor many years, Emil Bossard, groundskeeper for the Cleveland Indians, was in charge of Hi Corbett Field, during Spring Training. In 1959, he was considered the top groundskeeper in Major League Baseball and was inducted into the Major League Baseball Groundskeeper Hall of Fame in 2012. According to historian David Leighton, of the \"Arizona Daily Star\" newspaper, Emil Bossard Field and the street Bossard Place both located at Reid Park, are named in his honor.\n\nHi Corbett served as the spring training home of Cleveland from 1947 through 1992. Cleveland announced in 1990 that they would depart Tucson and the city tried to attract the Baltimore Orioles to move to Arizona. Parts of the 1989 movie \"Major League\" were filmed at Hi Corbett Field where the production used members of the University of Arizona Wildcats baseball team as extras.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2010, Hi Corbett was the pre-season home of the expansion Colorado Rockies, who moved into Hi Corbett with their inaugural spring training.\n\nHi Corbett is also closely associated with minor league baseball. Aside from the Lizards, the Tucson Cowboys (Class C; Arizona–Texas League) played at Hi Corbett intermittently from the late 1930s until 1958. The original Tucson Toros (Class AAA; Pacific Coast League) played there from their inception in 1969 until 1997 (see below for new Toros team). The largest Tucson Toros crowd at Hi Corbett was 12,863 on May 17, 1981 against Salt Lake City. In 1997, the Toros essentially exchanged ownership and franchises with the nearby Phoenix Firebirds, so that the ex-Toros played in Scottsdale Stadium as the Firebirds, and the ex-Firebirds played at Hi Corbett as the Toros. In 1998 the Phoenix team relocated to Fresno, California and was renamed the Fresno Grizzlies, and the Tucson Toros became the Tucson Sidewinders, and played in the new Tucson Electric Park, which was renamed in January 2011 to Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium.\n\nThe Arizona Fall League, a short season league for major league prospects, fielded a team at Hi Corbett in 1993 and 1994, known as the Tucson Javelinas. The team relocated to Peoria in 1995 (becoming the Peoria Javelinas) to limit travel distances to the Phoenix metropolitan area.\n\nUSA Baseball was headquartered at Hi Corbett from 1997 to 2003.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2007 Hi Corbett was home to the Arizona Heat women's professional softball team.\n\nIn addition to the large number of visiting teams that have appeared there as part of regular league play, Hi Corbett has hosted exhibition games featuring the Colorado Silver Bullets, Houston Astros and University of Arizona, among others. Baseball Hall of Fame members who played at Hi Corbett include Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Ted Williams and many others.\n\nOn May 21, 2009, the Tucson Toros returned to Hi Corbett Field after an 11-year absence, playing as an Independent Professional Baseball League team of the Golden Baseball League. Hi Corbett Field was the home stadium of the Toros until they were evicted by the city of Tucson in 2011 before they could join the North American League.\n\nIn 2012, the ballpark became the new home of the University of Arizona Wildcats baseball team. Through the first three-game series of the season against North Dakota State, the attendance at the stadium was a total of 8,870, which was nearly ¼ of the total home attendance for the Wildcats' previous season at Sancet Stadium, their longtime home on campus, located adjacent to McKale Center. Hi Corbett Field hosted both an NCAA Regional and Super Regional, as Arizona won both to advance to the 2012 College World Series. The relocation of the Wildcat baseball program to Hi Corbett has been noted as a major factor in the team's successful 2012 season, and their fourth national championship.\n\nIn 2007, the Rockies asked for a package of improvements to Hi Corbett potentially totaling $10–20 million under the threat of a possible move to Goodyear. In response, Pima County chartered a regional sports and tourism authority, funded by tourism and other taxes. \n\nSuch authority was approved both by the Arizona Legislature and voters of the county. The departure of the Chicago White Sox from Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium, has forced team management to expedite plans for a future move, as the Rockies have stated that they need two other teams in order for Tucson to be a viable spring training town for them.\n\nThe Rockies decided to move to the new Salt River Fields at Talking Stick in 2011 on tribal land owned by the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community near Scottsdale. The Arizona Diamondbacks share that facility.\n\nAs noted above, in an effort to have its baseball program compete in the best possible facilities, in August 2011, the University of Arizona signed an agreement with the city of Tucson for Arizona baseball to play its home games at Hi Corbett for the 2012 season; the initial agreement was for five years with an option to renew the contract. The UA has made several upgrades to the facility, where the Wildcats previously played selected games in the 1960s and '70s. Hi Corbett is located about three miles southeast of the UA campus.\n\nIn 2013, the Wildcats ranked 21st among Division I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 2,733 per home game.\n\nIn March 2017, the University signed a new 25-year lease on Hi Corbett Field, taking over the day-to-day management of the baseball stadium from the City of Tucson.\n\n\n"}

The team took its name from the successful Boston club of the National Association and National League often known as the (Boston) Red Stockings. The club lasted only two seasons, but in those two seasons they were league champions.\n\nIn 1890 the Reds won the Players' League pennant when they finished first ahead of the New York Giants, and then won the American Association pennant when they finished first ahead of the St. Louis Browns (now the Cardinals). The Boston Reds are one of two major league teams to win back-to-back pennants spanning two different leagues. The Brooklyn Dodgers did it also, winning the AA pennant in 1889 and the NL pennant in 1890.\n\nAt the conclusion of the 1891 season, the National League pressed for the consolidation of the American Association with the National League. Part of the posturing included the National League directing its champion Boston not to play the Reds in a World Series. The leagues settled, adding four AA clubs to a combined circuit. As part of the settlement, the owners of the four clubs not joining the combined circuit, including the Reds, were paid $135,000 and their players dispersed to the surviving clubs.\n\nTheir abandoned ballpark was revived for use by the National League club in 1894, during the weeks that South End Grounds was being rebuilt following a fire.

It is often referred in short as Phoenix Muni. The stadium was built in 1964 and holds 8,775 people. It is currently the home to the Arizona State Sun Devils baseball program, having relocated to Phoenix Municipal Stadium at the start of their 2015 season. It is the former spring training home to the Oakland A's, having played their home games from 1982 to 2014. The San Francisco Giants held spring training at the ballpark from 1964 to 1981, when they moved to Scottsdale Stadium.\n\nThe original Phoenix Municipal Stadium was located at Central and Mohave streets, near downtown Phoenix. The ballpark opened in 1936 and had seating for around 3,000 spectators. Lights were installed by 1937.\n\nThe old stadium was used for various local baseball games, wrestling, and dog racing until 1946, when the New York Giants made arrangements to begin spring training there. The stadium required renovations and an injunction was filed against holding any further dog races at the stadium site to bring the Giants to town.\n\nThe Giants played their first game against major league opposition at the old stadium on March 9, 1947, defeating the Cleveland Indians 8-7 in front of a crowd of 8,000. The Phoenix Senators of the Arizona-Texas league also held games there in 1947.\n\nThe Giants renewed their agreement in April 1947 to stay at the stadium until 1950. They ultimately played there until 1963, when they moved to the new stadium.\n\nThe Phoenix city council approved construction of a new municipal stadium at Papago Park on June 4, 1962, to fully replace the old stadium. Plans for the stadium notably included six water fountains, as they were not originally included at the then-new Dodger Stadium. However, construction was delayed a year, in part because the stadium meant to be partially funded by selling the land the old stadium sat on - only one bidder appeared at the auction, and only bid on the parking lot, leaving a funding gap.\n\nThe council finally agreed to another approval on April 23, 1963, with the architect's proposed budget of $605,300. \n\nThe first spring training game was played on March 8, 1964, in which the Giants beat Cleveland, 6-2. Willie Mays hit the first home run at the park, in front of a crowd of 8,582. In attendance, for the dedication ceremonies, were Commissioner Ford Frick, National League President Warren Giles, and Giants owner Horace Stoneham.\n\nThe stadium hosted a \"welcome home\" rally for presidential candidate Barry Goldwater on October 31, 1964, shortly before the election. It was the first time the stadium had been filled to capacity.\n\nThe city of Phoenix installed an evaporative cooling system in the stadium in 1966.\n\nThe Phoenix Giants returned in 1966 as a Triple-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. That year the Giants signed a five-year lease on the stadium at $15,000/year to use Phoenix Muni for spring training, Triple-A games, and winter instructional league. They rebranded as the Firebirds in 1986.\n\nIn 1981, the San Francisco Giants signed an agreement to move to Scottsdale Stadium because the city of Phoenix did not provide requested renovations. The Oakland Athletics, who previously trained in Scottsdale, signed a seven-year lease to move to the stadium. The A's also renovated the dugouts and training complex.\n\nThe Phoenix Firebirds moved from the stadium in 1992 after entering discussions with the city of Scottsdale to play at the newly rebuilt Scottsdale Stadium. At the time of the move, the Firebirds' $10,000/year rent agreement did not come close to covering the city of Phoenix's maintenance expenses.\n\nIn 2003, the stadium underwent a $6.4 million renovation. The press box facilities were enclosed - at the time, the stadium had the only open-air facilities in the Cactus League. New dugouts, better signage, improved concourse areas with benches, shading, and a historical timeline were all added.\n\nIn 2013, The Arizona Board of Regents approved Arizona State University's 25-year lease to Phoenix Municipal Stadium. The stadium is 2.5 miles from Arizona State's main campus in Tempe (and as such, accessible via the Phoenix light rail system). The ASU baseball program has history at the site, as Reggie Jackson was the first college player to hit a home run out of Phoenix Municipal Stadium. The Sun Devils started play in 2015 after which Packard Stadium, their former venue, will be redeveloped to help pay for planned improvements to the ASU football facility, Sun Devil Stadium.\n\nArizona State had previously played selected games at the stadium in the 1960s, especially against their rival, the University of Arizona.\n\nThe stadium has also hosted Arizona Fall League games during the fall. It hosted the home games of the Phoenix Desert Dogs until their 2013 move to Glendale. The Arizona Diamondbacks’ rookie league team, the Phoenix Diamondbacks, also played in the stadium when the team played in the Arizona League. Several of the Arizona high school baseball championships are played there in early May.\n\nThe stadium's light poles are the original light poles which were installed at the Polo Grounds in New York City in 1940. They served Polo Grounds until 1964, when the stadium was demolished. Horace Stoneham, the Giants owner, shipped the light poles to Phoenix.\n\nPhoenix Muni hosted outdoor concerts from major touring acts in the years before Desert Sky Pavilion, an outdoor amphitheatre, opened on the west side of Phoenix in 1990.\n\nBlack Sabbath and Blue Öyster Cult performed at the stadium during their Black & Blue Tour on July 25, 1980. The Police performed at the stadium during their Synchronicity Tour on September 8, 1983. AC/DC performed at the stadium during their Fly on the Wall Tour on October 17, 1985. Pink Floyd performed, on two consecutive nights, at the stadium during their A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour on April 25–26, 1988.\n\n\n"}

Designed by the owner of the Baltimore Orioles' Camden Yards, the new stadium was built in 1992 and holds 12,000 people. It has been the spring training home of the San Francisco Giants since 1984, when the capacity was just 4,721.\n\nThe stadium hosted three games of the 2006 World Baseball Classic.\n\nThe stadium was built on the site of the old Scottsdale Stadium, which opened in 1956. The Baltimore Orioles (1956-58), Boston Red Sox (1959-65), Chicago Cubs (1967-78) and Oakland Athletics (1979-83) used old Scottsdale Stadium as their spring training base before the Giants moved here in 1984. The new stadium cost $7 million to build and was completed in under a year.\n\nIn 1992, Angels pitcher Matt Keough was struck by a foul ball while sitting in the dugout during spring training and was critically injured. His life was saved in part because the stadium is across the street from a hospital.\n\nThe stadium underwent a $23.1 million renovation in 2006. The renovations included a new team store, expanded clubhouse, baseball training and treatment room, batting tunnel, centerfield entrance, Charro Pavilion, and practice fields next to the stadium. In return, the San Francisco Giants agreed to play at the stadium for an additional 20 years, through 2025, with an option to extend the lease to 2035.\n\nThe Giants hold their major league and minor league training operation at the two facilities. Scottsdale Stadium is consistently one of the top attended venues in Arizona's Cactus League. The Scottsdale Charros organize and promote San Francisco spring training in the city.\n\nScottsdale Stadium was the home of the Phoenix Firebirds of the Pacific Coast League from 1992 until 1997, who had moved from Phoenix Municipal Stadium after the new stadium was completed. The Firebirds moved to Fresno, California, and became the Grizzlies, in order to make room for the National League's Arizona Diamondbacks, who began play in 1998. Scottsdale also hosted the Valley Vipers of the independent Western Baseball League in 2000, the only season of that team's existence. Arizona United SC of the United Soccer League played at Scottsdale in 2015.\n\nThe stadium is also host of the Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona Fall League, and hosts the Fall League's championship game at the end of November. During the summer the stadium is home the Arizona League Giants of the Arizona League.\n\nIn March 2006, the stadium hosted three games from Pool B of the World Baseball Classic. \n\n"}

She is the subject of a celebrated biography, \"\" (1957), written by Hannah Arendt. Arendt cherished Varnhagen as her \"closest friend, though she ha[d] been dead for some hundred years\". The asteroid 100029 Varnhagen is named in her honour.\nRahel Levin was born to a Jewish family in Berlin. Her father, a wealthy jeweler, was a strong-willed man who ruled his family despotically. She became close friends with Dorothea and Henriette, the daughters of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn. Through them she got to know Henriette Herz, with whom she would become most intimately associated throughout her life, moving in the same intellectual spheres. Together with Henriette Herz and her cousin, Sara Grotthuis née Meyer, she hosted one of the most famous Berlin salons of the 1800s. Her home became the meeting place for artists, poets and intellectuals such as Schlegel, Schelling, Steffens, Schack, Schleiermacher, Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt, Motte Fouqué, Baron Brückmann, Ludwig Tieck, Jean Paul, and Friedrich Gentz. During a visit to Carlsbad in 1795 she was introduced to Goethe, whom she met again in Frankfurt am Main in 1815.\n\nAfter 1806, she lived in Paris, Frankfurt am Main, Hamburg, Prague, and Dresden. This period was one of misfortune for Germany; Prussia was reduced to a small kingdom and its king was in exile. Secret societies were formed in every part of the country with the object of throwing off the tyranny of Napoleon. Levin herself belonged to one of these societies.\n\nIn 1814, she married the biographer Karl August Varnhagen von Ense in Berlin, after having converted to Christianity—this also made her sister-in-law to the poet Rosa Maria Assing. At the time of their marriage, her husband, who had fought in the Austrian army against the French, belonged to the Prussian diplomatic corps, and their house in Vienna became a meeting place for Prussian delegates to the Congress of Vienna. In 1815, she accompanied her husband to Vienna, and then to Karlsruhe in 1816, where he became a Prussian representative. She returned to Berlin in 1819, when her husband retired from his diplomatic position.\n\nThough never the author of a major book, Rahel Varnhagen is remembered both for the intensity and variety of her correspondence. Six thousand letters have survived, out of an estimated ten thousand letters written by her in the course of her lifetime. A few of her essays were published in \"Das Morgenblatt\", \"Das Schweizerische Museum,\" and \"Der Gesellschafter;\" in 1830, her \"Denkblätter einer Berlinerin\" was published in Berlin. Her husband, Karl August, edited and published her correspondence in the twenty years following her death. Her correspondence with David Veit and with Karl August was published in Leipzig, in 1861 and 1874–1875 respectively.\n\nRahel Varnhagen died in Berlin in 1833. Her grave is located in the Dreifaltigkeitsfriedhof I Berlin-Kreuzberg. Her husband published two memorial volumes after her death containing selections from her work: \"Rahel, ein Buch des Andenkens für ihre Freunde\" (Rahel, a memorial book for her friends; 3 vols., 1834; new ed., 1903) and \"Galerie von Bildnissen aus Rahels Umgang\" (Gallery of portraits from Rahel's circle; 2 vols., 1836).\n\nAccording to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" (1906), \"Rahel always showed the greatest interest in her former coreligionists, endeavoring by word and deed to better their position, especially during the anti-Semitic outburst in Germany in 1819. On the day of her funeral Varnhagen sent a considerable sum of money to the Jewish poor of Berlin.\"\n\nAmos Elon wrote about Rahel Varnhagen in his 2002 book, \"The Pity of It All: A History of the Jews in Germany, 1743-1933\":\nShe hated her Jewish background and was convinced it had poisoned her life. For much of her adult life she was what would later be called self-hating. Her overriding desire was to free herself from the shackles of her birth; since, as she thought, she had been \"pushed out of the world\" by her origins, she was determined to escape them. She never really succeeded. In 1810, she changed her family name to Robert... And in 1814, after her mother died, she converted. But her origins continued to haunt her even on her deathbed. ... She considered her origins \"a curse, a slow bleeding to death.\" ... The idea that as a Jew she was always required to be exceptional—and go on proving it all the time—was repugnant to her. \"How wretched it is always to have to legitimize myself! That is why it is so disgusting to be a Jew.\"\n\nRahel's husband published an account of her deathbed scene, which Amos Elon described as \"stylized and possibly overdramatised\", including her alleged last words:\nWhat a history! A fugitive from Egypt and Palestine, here I am and find help, love, fostering in you people. With real rapture I think of those origins of mine and this whole nexus of destiny, through which the oldest memories of the human race stand side by side with the latest developments...The thing which all my life seemed to me the greatest shame, which was the misery and misfortune of my life—having been born a Jewess—this I should on no account now wish to have missed. \n\nThe poet Ludwig Robert was her brother, and she corresponded extensively with him. Her sister Rosa was married to Karel Asser. Ludmilla Assing and Ottilie Assing were her nieces-in-law.\n\n"}
{"id": "1922895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922895", "title": "Oklahoma State Highway 66", "text": "Oklahoma State Highway 66\n\nState Highway 66 (abbreviated SH-66) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Oklahoma, beginning at U.S. Highway 81 in El Reno and ending at U.S. Highway 60 near White Oak. The highway was designated in 1985 as a replacement for the decommissioned US-66. Although most of the highway follows Historic Route 66, the highway follows US-66's final alignment, joining Interstate 44 through Tulsa and Oklahoma City, while older versions of the route follow various city streets through both cities.\n\nThe highway has retained its importance for most of its length due to its paralleling Interstate 44 which between Missouri and Oklahoma City (except in the cities of Tulsa and Oklahoma City) is a toll road.\n\nSH-66 currently has one spur route, designated SH-66B, in Wellston.\n\nState Highway 66 begins at Business I-40 in El Reno (another old Route 66 segment), concurrent at this point with US-81. From this intersection, the highway heads due east. The highway briefly passes through a rural area after leaving El Reno, before transitioning into the Oklahoma City suburb of Yukon. In Yukon, the route runs along Main Street, and has a short concurrency with SH-4. SH-66 continues east, passing into Oklahoma City, where it becomes N.W. 39th Expressway. SH-66 has an interchange with the Kilpatrick Turnpike on the far west edge of the city. The highway passes just to the north of Lake Overholser. Near where the road crosses over the North Canadian River, the inlet to the lake, it crosses from Canadian County into Oklahoma County.\n\nN.W. 39th Expressway, still carrying SH-66, forms the main street of both Bethany and Warr Acres, two enclave suburbs of Oklahoma City. The street passes just to the south of Wiley Post Airport and provides access to Southern Nazarene University. After leaving Warr Acres, the highway re-enters Oklahoma City. SH-66 leaves N.W. 39th Expressway at an interchange with I-44 and SH-3/SH-74 (the Lake Hefner Parkway). SH-66 begins a concurrency with eastbound I-44, and for the remainder of its length, it will stay close to the interstate.\n\nSH-66 is unsigned through its time on the Oklahoma City freeway system. I-44, while concurrent with SH-66, runs along the north side of Oklahoma City, passing just south of Penn Square Mall, and meets Interstate 235 at a cloverleaf interchange at its northern terminus (north of the interchange, US-77 continues on as a freeway, the Broadway Extension). I-44 and SH-66 begin a concurrency with I-35 near Remington Park. The two interstates and the state highway head north through the northeast part of the city. At Hefner Road, the routes pass near the Frontier City amusement park. The highways then encounter an interchange which is the eastern terminus of the Kilpatrick Turnpike. This interchange is also where I-44 splits off to form the Turner Turnpike.\n\nI-35 and SH-66 leave Oklahoma City and enter the suburb of Edmond. On the north side of town, SH-66 exits the interstate, while US-77 joins it. SH-66 continues east out of town, providing access to Arcadia Lake. The highway then passes through the town of Arcadia, home of the Round Barn, a Route 66 landmark. The highway then serves Luther before exiting Oklahoma County.\n\nOn the west side of Lincoln County, SH-66 produces a business loop to Wellston, SH-66B (below). Just beyond this junction, SH-66 serves as the northern terminus of SH-102. The highway continues east, meeting up again with SH-66B on the east side of Wellston. Near this junction, SH-66 has an interchange with the Turner Turnpike (still carrying I-44). The route continues to parallel the turnpike as it comes to an intersection with US-177. East of this junction, SH-66 passes through the town of Warwick, where it crosses the Deep Fork of the Canadian River.\n\nOn the southwest side of Chandler, the county seat of Lincoln County, the route is joined by SH-18. The two routes turn north, passing through the core of the downtown area. On the north side of downtown, SH-66 splits off to the east. Seven miles (11 km) east of Chandler, the highway passes through the town of Davenport. The route next encounters Stroud, where SH-66 intersects State Highway 99 and US-377, which may serve as the northern terminus of US-377.\n\nEast of Stroud, SH-66 passes into Creek County. The highway passes through the town of Depew northeast of Stroud. The route next passes through Bristow, where it has a brief concurrency with SH-16 and begins a more lengthy one with SH-48. SH-48/66 exit Bristow to the north, with an interchange where they cross the Turner Turnpike. Near unincorporated Bellvue, SH-66 splits away from SH-48 and turns back to the northeast. The highway crosses the Turner Turnpike again (with no interchange this time), then runs through Kellyville. Four miles (6.4 km) northeast of Kellyville, the highway begins a concurrency with SH-33. SH-33 and SH-66 will remain signed together as they enter the Tulsa metropolitan area.\n\nSH-33/66 next enter Sapulpa, the county seat of Creek County and a suburb of Tulsa. In Sapulpa, the two highways serve as the western terminus of SH-117. They then come to the intersection of Dewey Avenue and Main Street in downtown Sapulpa, where SH-33 ends. This intersection also serves as the southern terminus of SH-97. SH-66 continues east through the intersection, joined by US-75 ALT. The two highways intersect SH-117A at its northern terminus, and turn left to continue its alignment. US-75 ALT/SH-66 parallel the Turner Turnpike within sight distance for the remainder of their journey in Creek County. Near the Creek–Tulsa County line, the Turner Turnpike ends, and SH-66 merges onto the now toll-free I-44. US-75 ALT ends at the merge.\n\nI-44/SH-66 cut diagonally through the city of Tulsa. In West Tulsa, Interstate 244 branches off to serve the downtown area. I-44/SH-66 follow the Skelly Drive through midtown. The highways interchange with the Okmulgee Beeline, the US-75 freeway before crossing the Arkansas River. The next freeway interchange is with the Broken Arrow Expressway, carrying US-64 and SH-51, followed by the Mingo Valley Expressway, carrying US-169 I-244 then merges with I-44 at its eastern terminus. I-44/SH-66 cross into Rogers County and the suburb of Catoosa, serving as the southern terminus of SH-167. SH-66 then splits off from I-44, initially following an old alignment of the Interstate where it transitioned into the Will Rogers Turnpike. SH-66 then downgrades to an expressway as it passes through Catoosa, home of the Blue Whale. Northeast of Catoosa, near Verdigris, SH-66 intersects SH-266 at its eastern terminus.\n\nThe next town that SH-66 serves after leaving the Tulsa area is Claremore, seat of Rogers County. In Claremore, SH-66 has brief concurrencies with SH-20 and SH-88. The highway continues northeast through Rogers County, bypassing Sequoyah to the west and serving as the western terminus of SH-28A in Foyil. The highway passes through Bushyhead northeast of Foyil, and then intersect SH-28 in Chelsea further northeast. The route then crosses into Craig County, where it serves the unincorporated place of White Oak. The SH-66 designation then comes to an end at US-60, which Route 66 historically followed into Vinita.\n\nThe present-day SH-66 was established to fill the void left when US-66 was decommissioned through Oklahoma in the early 1980s. SH-66 was designated as its replacement from El Reno to White Oak on April 1, 1985. The remainder of US-66 in Oklahoma was overlapped by other highways, principally I-40 and US-69, so the SH-66 designation was not applied to these sections of highway.\n\nOn July 1, 1991, SH-66 was realigned in the vicinity of Luther. No further changes to the SH-66 designation have occurred since that time. Planned improvements by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation include reconstruction and widening of SH-66 from two to four lanes from Edmond to the Lincoln County line.\n\nWhile US-66 was still active, the SH-66 designation was given to a loop route through Wellston. This incarnation of SH-66 effectively served as a Wellston business loop for US-66. This route was first established on June 26, 1934. SH-66B is long.\n\n\n"}

She was a first cousin of Empress Kōjun of Japan. On her mother's side, she was also a first cousin of Princess Setsuko.\n\nPrincess Masako was a leading candidate to wed the crown prince of Japan, the future Emperor Hirohito. Other candidates included Princess Kuni Nagako (who became the future Empress Kōjun), and Tokiko Ichijō, a peeress. The possibility of infertility and the feeble political influence of her family were among the reasons she was removed from the list of candidates. However, Princess Masako was selected instead to wed Crown Prince Euimin of Korea who had been held by Japanese government under the pretense of studying abroad in 1917. The wedding was held on 28 April 1920, at Korean King's Palace in Tokyo. Princess Masako was still a student at the Girls' Department of the Gakushūin Peers' School at the time and her new title became \"Her Royal Highness Bangja, Crown Princess Euimin\". Despite an unfavorable fertility diagnosis prior to her marriage, she gave birth to a son, Prince Jin, on 18 August 1921. However, Prince Jin died under suspicious circumstances when she visited Korea with her husband on 11 May 1922.\n\nOn 24 April 1926, Crown Princess Bangja received the formal title \"Her Majesty Queen Lee\" when the Emperor Sunjong, the elder brother of Crown Prince Euimin, died. Under the terms of the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty, the Korean royal title was demoted from that of \"Emperor\" to \"King\" and Crown Prince Euimin was never formally crowned as king; therefore Princess Masako continued to be styled \"Bangja, Crown Princess Euimin\". On 29 December 1929, she gave birth to a second son, Prince Gu.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, all former royal and peerage titles were abolished by the American occupation authorities. Republic of Korea President Rhee Syng-man's fear of Crown Prince Euimin's popularity prevented the family's homecoming, and they lived in destitution as Korean residents in Japan. In November 1963, Crown Princess Bangja and her family came back to Korea at the invitation of President Park Chung-hee and were allowed to live in Changdeok Palace in downtown Seoul. However, by this time, Crown Prince Euimin was already unconscious from cerebral thrombosis and was rushed to Seoul Sungmo Hospital where he remained bedridden for the rest of his life.\n\nThereafter, Princess Bangja devoted herself to the education of mentally and physically handicapped people. She successively became the chairman of various committees including the \"Commemorative Committee of Crown Prince Euimin\", and the \"Myeonghwi-won\", an asylum for deaf-and-dumb persons or patients suffering from infantile paralysis and she founded the \"Jahye School\" and the \"Myeonghye School\", which helps handicapped people become socially adapted. She was adored as the \"mother of the handicapped in Korea\" and despite lingering anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea she was a widely respected Japanese woman in Korea.\n\nSome members of the Nashimoto family, her relatives, visited Seoul in October 2008 to pay their respects. The Nashimotos have continued supporting her charity foundations for helping Korean physically challenged people even after the Princess died in 1989.\n\nCrown Princess Bangja died on 30 April 1989, aged 89, at the Nakseon Hall, Changdeok Palace from cancer. Her funeral was held as a semi-state funeral which Prince Mikasa and Princess Mikasa of Japan attended and she was buried beside her husband, Crown Prince Euimin, at the Hongyureung, Namyangju near Seoul.\n\nShe wrote an autobiography, \"The World is One: Princess Yi Pangja's Autobiography\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1922917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922917", "title": "Jon Tester", "text": "Jon Tester\n\nRaymond Jon Tester (born August 21, 1956) is an American politician serving as the senior United States Senator from Montana.\n\nTester was first elected to the Senate in 2006, defeating Republican incumbent Conrad Burns in one of the closest Senate races of that year. He narrowly won reelection in 2012 against U.S. Representative Denny Rehberg, and in 2018 against Montana State Auditor Matt Rosendale. Tester was previously the president of the Montana Senate and worked as a music teacher and farmer. He became Montana's senior senator in 2014 following Max Baucus's departure and is the dean of Montana's congressional delegation.\n\nTester was born in Havre, Montana, one of three sons of Helen Marie (née Pearson) and David O. Tester. His father was of English descent and his mother was of Swedish ancestry. Tester grew up in Chouteau County, near the town of Big Sandy, Montana, on land that his grandfather homesteaded in 1912. At the age of 9, he lost the middle three fingers of his left hand in a meat-grinder accident. In 1978, he graduated from the University of Providence, then the College of Great Falls, with a B.A. in music.\n\nTester then worked for two years as a music teacher in the Big Sandy School District before returning to his family's farm and custom butcher shop. He and his wife continue to operate the farm; in the 1980s, they switched from conventional to organic farming. Tester spent five years as chairman of the Big Sandy School Board of Trustees and was also on the Big Sandy Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Committee and the Chouteau County Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) Committee.\n\nTester was first elected to represent the 45th district in the Montana Senate in 1998, after his neighbor, a Republican State Senator, decided not to run for reelection. Before running for State Senate, Tester served on the Big Sandy school board for a decade. He was elected the minority whip for the 2001 session. In 2002, he was reelected with 71% of the vote, and he became minority leader in 2003. In 2004 he moved to the 15th district as a \"holdover\" because of redistricting. In 2005, Tester was elected president of the Montana Senate, the chief presiding officer of the Montana Legislature's upper chamber.\n\nHis election as President marked a transition for Montana Democrats as they moved into the majority leadership of the Senate for the first time in more than a decade. Term limits prohibited Tester from running for State Senate for a third consecutive term. Tester cited a prescription drug benefit program, reinstatement of the \"Made in Montana\" promotion program, a law to encourage renewable energy development, and his involvement with a bill that led to an historic increase in public school funding as accomplishments while in office.\n\n\nTester announced his candidacy in May 2005 for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican incumbent Senator Conrad Burns. Tester was the second Democrat to jump into the race, after state auditor John Morrison. While Tester was seen as having a greater following among his fellow legislators, his opponent, whose grandfather was governor of Nebraska, was able to raise significantly more money and had greater statewide name recognition.\n\nMorrison had collected $1.05 million as of the start of 2006, including $409,241 in the last three months of 2005, but \"Morrison's advantages in fundraising and name identification [did] not translate into a lead in the polls,\" most of which showed the race as being exceedingly tight, some calling it a \"deadlock\" as of late May.\n\nIn June 2006, Tester won the Democratic nomination by more than 25 percentage points in a six-way primary. Tester was described as having \"gained momentum in closing weeks of the campaign through an extensive grass-roots effort.\"\n\nIn the November 2006 election, Tester defeated Burns, receiving 198,302 votes (49%) to Burns's 195,455 (48%). The race was so close that Tester's victory was confirmed only the day after the election.\n\nTester successfully ran for reelection to a second term against Republican U.S. Congressman Denny Rehberg.\n\nTester's race was seen as a pivotal one for both parties seeking the Senate majority. Tester split with Democrats on several key issues, such as the Keystone XL oil pipeline, but also voted with his party on issues such as health care reform and the Dodd–Frank financial services overhaul.\n\nWhen announcing his candidacy, Rehberg called Tester a \"yes man\" for President Obama, saying that he sided with the administration in 97% of his votes. Rehberg cited Tester's support for the healthcare legislation and the 2009 stimulus, both of which Rehberg opposed. Tester said that he stood by his votes on both, saying that the healthcare legislation contained \"a lot of good stuff\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" noted that Tester diverged from his party on matters such as gun rights and illegal immigration.\n\nTester successfully ran for a third term against Republican Montana State Auditor Matt Rosendale, eventually winning a high-turnout election by over 15,000 votes and crossing the 50 percent threshold in vote totals for the first time in three Senate elections. President Donald Trump made a particular effort to unseat Tester, traveling to Montana four times over the preceding months; despite some increase in Republican turnout in the state, Tester secured victory with increased turnout in Democratic-leaning areas of the state, strong support from Native Americans and women, increased support among independent voters, and 67 percent of the youth vote.\n\nDuring a 2006 Billings press conference, the Tester campaign released a statement from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., pledging to give Tester a coveted seat on the Appropriations Committee \"as soon as possible,\" regardless of whether Democrats wrested control of the Senate from Republicans. On January 13, 2009, during Tester's second session of Congress, he was given a seat on the Appropriations Committee. In 2013, Tester became chairman of the Banking Committee's Securities, Insurance, and Investment Subcommittee.\n\nIn September 2013, he announced opposition to the appointment of Larry Summers as chairman of the Federal Reserve; lacking a committee majority, Summers then withdrew his name from consideration.\n\nCommittee assignments\n\n\nCaucus memberships\n\n\nTester presents himself as a moderate Democrat. In an interview with Rachel Maddow, he described himself as a moderate. A \"New York Times\" profile of Tester after his 2006 election described him as \"truly your grandfather's Democrat—a pro-gun, anti-big-business prairie pragmatist whose life is defined by the treeless patch of hard Montana dirt that has been in the family since 1916.\" In 2012, \"USA Today\" noted that Tester had sometimes \"split with Democrats — most recently in his support of construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast — but he has voted with Obama on the most critical issues of his presidency: the stimulus, the health care legislation and the Dodd-Frank financial services overhaul.\" \"FiveThirtyEight\", which tracks votes in Congress, found that Tester voted with Trump's position about 31% of the time as of April 2020. \"CQ Roll Call\" reported that Tester voted with Trump's position approximately half of the time in 2017 and 2018.\n\nTester is often considered a moderate or centrist Democrat. According to GovTrack, he is the Senate's fourth most moderate Democrat, to the right of most of his Democratic colleagues and even Republican Senator Susan Collins. Tester has generally received high ratings from liberal groups and low scores from conservative groups. In 2012, he was given a 90% rating by Americans for Democratic Action and 86% by the League of Conservation Voters. Conversely, he received scores of 11% from the National Taxpayers Union and 4% from the American Conservative Union. The nonpartisan \"National Journal\" rated his votes overall as 55% liberal and 45% conservative.\n\nIn 2013, \"National Journal\" gave him a score of 51% on \"Liberal on Economic Policy\" and 48% on \"Conservative on Economic Policy.\" In 2015-16, the conservative Center for Security Policy gave him a 13% rating.\nCrowdPac, which rates politicians based on donations they receive and give, gave Tester a score of 5.3L, with 10L being the most liberal and 10C the most conservative.\n\nOn December 18, 2010, Tester voted in favor of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. While he opposed same-sex marriage during both his 2006 and 2012 campaigns, Tester announced his support for it in March 2013, citing concerns about federal government overreach. After the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling mandating that all U.S. states recognize gay marriage, Tester praised the ruling as protecting gays' \"rights and freedoms.\"\n\nHe supports abortion rights and embryonic stem cell research.\n\nOn \"Meet the Press\" in 2006, he asserted that \"there's no more middle class\" because of Bush administration policies.\n\nIn 2011, Tester was one of two Democratic senators to filibuster the American Jobs Act. It was reported that he wasn't concerned about the surtax on some families to pay for the plan, but was unsure that the new spending would actually create jobs. \"I've got more of a concern about a state aid package...and how the money is going to be spent and whether it's really going to create jobs,\" he explained.\n\nIn January 2018, Tester was the only Democratic senator from a Republican-leaning state to oppose a stopgap funding measure to end a three-day government shutdown and reopen the federal government.\n\nIn 2018, Tester became one of the Democrats in the Senate supporting a bill that would relax \"key banking regulations\". As one of at least 11 other Democrats, he argued that the bill would \"right-size post-crisis rules imposed on small and regional lenders and help make it easier for them to provide credit\". Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren vehemently oppose the legislation. Tester became the first Democrat endorsed by Friends of Traditional Banking, a political action committee that had previously endorsed Republicans.\n\nIn December 2010, Tester voted against the DREAM Act, which would have created a pathway to citizenship for the foreign-born children of illegal immigrants. He has said, \"Illegal immigration is a critical problem facing our country, but amnesty is not the solution. I do not support legislation that provides a path for citizenship for anyone in this country illegally.\"\n\nIn 2017, he criticized President Trump for saying that he would cancel DACA in six months. \"I don't support what the president did,\" Tester said. \"I think it's ill-informed, I think it rips families apart, and it's not what this country stands for.\" Asked if he would now commit to voting for the DREAM Act, he said, \"I support comprehensive immigration reform.\"\n\nIn January 2018, Tester and three other Democratic senators co-sponsored the Border and Port Security Act, legislation to mandate that U.S. Customs and Border Protection \"hire, train and assign at least 500 officers per year until the number of needed positions the model identifies is filled\" and require the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection to determine potential equipment and infrastructure improvements for ports of entry.\n\nTester supported the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, voting for it in December 2009. He voted for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.\n\nIn 2017, he said that Democrats should consider a single-payer health care system. In July that year, Tester said that health care needed reform but that the latest GOP attempt at reform was a \"train wreck\" that would \"strip health care away from millions of Americans.\" He said that Democrats should \"work to fix what's wrong with the current health care system in a bipartisan way. And that means going through committee process, not doing it in a dark room with a select few, but going through the committee process and getting good ideas from everybody.\" Reminded that some Democrats \"believe that compromise on this issue is not only unprincipled but unnecessary,\" Tester said the issue was \"too important...not to try to help remedy the problems.\"\n\nIn August 2019 Tester was one of 19 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar requesting data from the Trump administration in order to help states and Congress understand the potential consequences of the Texas v. United States Affordable Care Act lawsuit, writing that an overhaul of the present health care system would form \"an enormous hole in the pocketbooks of the people we serve as well as wreck state budgets\".\n\nIn October 2019 Tester was one of 27 senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer advocating the passage of the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act, which was set to expire the following month. The senators warned that if the funding for the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) was allowed to expire, it \"would cause an estimated 2,400 site closures, 47,000 lost jobs, and threaten the health care of approximately 9 million Americans.\"\n\nIn April 2019 Tester was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing \"HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country\" and expressing disappointment that President Trump's budget \"has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.\" The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.\n\nTester voted to confirm Supreme Court nominees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. He refused to support Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch, writing that \"Judge Gorsuch is a smart man but that doesn't make him right for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.\" He explained that he could not \"support a nominee who refuses to answer important questions,\" and said he feared that under Gorsuch \"dark money [would] continue to drown out the voices and votes of citizens, the Court [would] stand between women and their doctors, and the government [would] reach into the private lives of law-abiding Americans.\" He criticized Gorsuch's rulings in \"Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby\", in which Gorsuch \"ruled that a corporation can have religious beliefs just like people,\" and in \"Riddle v. Hickenlooper\", which showed that \"Gorsuch believes campaign contributions deserve First Amendment protections.\" He feared that Justice Gorsuch \"would threaten our access to a doctor and endanger the Constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens\" and charged that while Gorsuch \"is good on the Second Amendment, his views on the Fourth Amendment — guaranteeing the right to privacy — should be concerning to everyone.\"\n\nTester opposed the Supreme Court's \"Citizens United\" ruling. The ruling allowed corporations and unions to donate unlimited amounts of money to third-party political groups. He proposed a constitutional amendment to reverse the decision, and argued that the ruling had a bad impact on American democracy.\n\nTester promoted the use of carbon-capture and sequestration technology to cleanly exploit Montana's coal reserves.\n\nIn May 2011 a \"Newsweek\" reporter who traveled with Tester in Montana said that the \"desire to wrest control of wolves from D.C...was the only topic that came up everywhere he went: hotels, coffee shops, art auctions. 'What do you think about wolves?' a sixth grader asked during an assembly in Miles City. 'I think we should start hunting them again!' Tester said. The kids let out their loudest cheer of the afternoon.\"\nTester tried to revive a bill that was meant to be a compromise between the conservationists and the timber industry. The bill would put 700,000 acres of wilderness aside for \"light-on-the-land logging projects\" with the intention of creating jobs in the flagging industry. It was noted that Tester was not \"winning admirers on his side\", with some liberal environmentalists saying that gives lumber mills control of the national forests.\n\nIn April 2019 Tester was one of 12 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to top senators on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development advocating that the Energy Department be granted maximum funding for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), arguing that American job growth could be stimulated by investment in capturing carbon emissions and expressing disagreement with President Trump's 2020 budget request to combine the two federal programs that do carbon capture research.\n\nIn September 2019 Tester was one of eight senators to sign a bipartisan letter to congressional leadership requesting full and lasting funding of the Land and Water Conservation Act in order to aid national parks and public lands, benefit the $887 billion American outdoor recreation economy, and \"ensure much-needed investment in our public lands and continuity for the state, tribal, and non-federal partners who depend on them.\"\n\nTester is a gun owner. On gun rights, the National Rifle Association has given him an A- rating, but another group, Gun Owners of America, has given Tester a rating of F.\n\nTester supports efforts to loosen restrictions on gun exports, stating such an action would help U.S. gun manufacturers expand their business and would create more jobs.\n\nIn 2016, Tester voted against a Democrat-sponsored proposal that would have required background checks for purchases at gun shows and for purchases of guns online nationwide. He argued that the bill would \"have blocked family members and neighbors from buying and selling guns to one another without a background check.\" Tester voted for a second Democrat-sponsored proposal to ban gun sales to individuals on the terrorist watch list. Both proposals failed.\n\nTester opposes the PATRIOT Act, believing it violates Montanans' right to privacy and the Fourth Amendment. During his first Senate election, in a September 24, 2006 debate in Butte, when Conrad Burns criticized Tester for wanting to weaken the PATRIOT Act, he replied: \"I don't want to weaken the PATRIOT Act, I want to repeal it!\" Tester opposed the confirmations of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, Mike Pompeo as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and Neil Gorsuch as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States for supporting the PATRIOT Act's bulk data collection provisions. On September 28, 2018, Tester announced that he would vote against confirming Brett Kavanaugh as an Associate Justice, citing among other reasons \"concerns that Judge Kavanaugh defended the PATRIOT Act instead of Montanans' privacy\", as Kavanaugh had helped the Bush Administration craft a program of mass domestic surveillance and ruled in favor of increased government surveillance under the PATRIOT Act in Klayman v. Obama. On April 4, 2017, Tester criticized Congress for passing a bill allowing internet service providers to collect and sell personal data and web browsing history to private companies.\n\nOn May 20, 2015, Tester was one of seven Senate Democrats to join Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky in his 10-hour filibuster against reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act.\n\nIn May 2018, Tester said that he would not support Gina Haspel's nomination to become CIA Director. The first Democrat from a red state to express opposition to her, he cited her role in Bush administration interrogation and detention programs, and said he was \"not a fan of waterboarding.\"\n\nAs ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Tester raised concerns about the nomination of Ronny Jackson to head the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. There were allegations against Jackson that he dispensed medications in a medically unethical fashion, was drunk on an overseas trip and drunkenly banged on the hotel door of a female colleague. Jackson denied the allegations but withdrew his nomination. In response, Trump called for Tester's resignation and said that the allegations against Jackson were false. According to \"CNN\", four sources familiar with the allegation that Jackson drunkenly banged on the door of a female colleague confirmed it. The Secret Service said it could not verify any of the allegations. Johnny Isakson, the Republican chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, defended Tester, saying he had no problem with Tester's handling of Jackson's nomination.\n\nIn June 2010, after giving a brief talk to a few attorneys at the offices of Thornton Law Firm in Boston, Tester received a total of $26,400 in campaign contributions from attendees. The firm later paid some of the partners a \"bonus\" exactly equal the contributions they had made out to Tester's campaign.\n\n\"The Hill\" reported in April 2011 that Tester had \"reaped a windfall in contributions from banks and lobbyists since introducing legislation to delay new regulations on debit-card swipe fees. Tester collected nearly $60,000 in contributions from credit card companies and other opponents of the proposed caps on swipe fees in the 17 days following the introduction of his bill.\" Much of the money came from executives at TCF Financial Corporation, the lead plaintiff in a federal lawsuit to block the \"Durbin rule,\" which would lower the fees that banks could charge retailers for debit-card transactions.\n\nA 2012 GOP ad claimed that Tester had \"received more lobbyist money than any other DC politician.\" In response, Tester ran an ad in which \"several Montanans prais[ed] Tester for cracking down on lobbyists.\" The \"Weekly Standard\" reported that despite the ad's claims, and despite Tester's 2006 promises to \"clean up the K Street lobbyist culture,\" Tester was indeed the Senate's top recipient of lobbyist money.\n\nIn March 2012, the Montana GOP filed a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee requesting an investigation into the actions of Tester and Max Baucus. The complaint cited a \"Politico\" report suggesting that Baucus' K Street connections were \"warning clients against giving campaign contributions to Tester's Republican challenger Rep. Denny Rehberg\". Tester denied any wrongdoing.\n\nDuring Tester's senior year in college, he married Sharla Bitz. Like Tester, she comes from an agricultural family and grew up in north-central Montana. They have two children: a daughter, Christine, born in 1980; and a son, Shon, born in 1985.\n\nBefore his election to the Senate, Tester had never lived more than two hours away from his north-central Montana farm. In addition to his Montana farm, Tester owns a home in Washington D.C.\n\nA January 2012 profile of Tester focused on the fact that he butchers and brings his own meat with him to Washington. He said \"Taking meat with us is just something that we do... We like our own meat.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1922922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922922", "title": "Imparja Television", "text": "Imparja Television\n\nImparja Television (IMP) is an Australian television station servicing remote eastern and central Australia, and the Mitta & Eskdale region in the heart of the Victorian high country. Broadcasting began on 2 January 1988. It is based in Alice Springs, where it has a studio and satellite uplink facility. Notably, it is controlled by Australian Aboriginals through ownership by Imparja Television Pty Ltd, and is widely regarded as a symbol of Aboriginal Australia. Most viewers receive Imparja via free to view satellite transmission, whilst a smaller proportion receive it via analogue terrestrial transmission.\n\n\"Imparja\" is an Arrernte word meaning footprints. The word is used to represent that Imparja Television aims to service Arrente people wherever they may live, from Mutitjulu to King's Canyon to Alice Springs to Tennant Creek and beyond. They describe their range as a footprint.\n\nIn 2008, Imparja Television was identified on-air and in print as Nine Imparja, following its dropping of Network Ten affiliation. In 2009, the station again identifies as simply \"Imparja\" and \"IMP\", although the Nine Network's nine dots seen in the logo remain.\n\nThe then Australian Broadcasting Tribunal was asked by the Federal Minister for Communications in October 1984 to inquire into the allocation of commercial television licences for a number of remote areas. Licences were granted in 1985 to the Golden West Network, which broadcast to Western Australia, and QSTV in north-eastern Australia.\n\nIn 1986 hearings for the allocation of the licence began, and the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA), which began providing Central Australian radio programs in local languages in 1980, formed Imparja Television Pty Ltd as a company. Soon after, the Government of the Northern Territory announced support to underpin the viability of the Central Zone Remote Television Service (RCTS) by offering to purchase an estimated $2 million package of services from the successful applicant. The Government of South Australia undertook a similar promise, offering loans of $1 million to Imparja if they were successful. An extraordinary saga of political, legal and commercial intrigue then ensued during the protracted Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) hearing process, pitching Federal, State and Territory Governments against one another with loan promises being substantially watered down or withdrawn as it became apparent the CAAMA application may prevail. Windfall funding from the Australian Bicentennial Authority and the Aboriginal Development Commission ultimately underpinned the feasibility of the CAAMA bid and they were successfully allocated the licence. However subsequent Federal Administrative Tribunal court proceedings brought about by the unsuccessful applicant, Darwin based Territory Television Ltd., attempting to overturn the ABT's decision delayed construction commencement of the new service until May 1987.\n\nBy October 1987 the new station had begun to build rebroadcast sites and new studios and a main transmitter based in Alice Springs were completed. Imparja's first test program, \"Australia versus Sri Lanka Test Cricket\", was telecast on 2 January 1988 in Alice Springs. Two weeks later, on 15 January 1988, the station was officially inaugurated at Imparja Television's head office in Alice Springs by Minister for Communications Ralph Willis and Warren Snowdon, the Australian federal member of parliament for the Division of Lingiari in Northern Territory.\n\nImparja became the first Aboriginal member of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations and the now-defunct Regional Television Association, both dominant organisations at the time.\n\nImparja was chaired by Freda Glynn for its first ten years and, for a time, she was the only female chair of a television network in the world. Freda was one of the first three founders of CAAMA – the others being John Macumba and Philip Batty.\n\nImparja had an initial population reach of 62,000 people, which by 1993 had grown to 125,000. Imparja was available through retransmission sites at Ceduna, Coober Pedy, Leigh Creek and Woomera in South Australia, and Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Katherine and Bathurst Island in the Northern Territory, as well as on the Optus Aurora satellite platform.\n\nImparja initially carried programming from all three major Australian commercial television networks, but following aggregation of market area with QSTV, it affiliated with the Nine Network and Network Ten. Imparja also screened some ABC Television and SBS Television indigenous programs, all in addition to original programs commissioned by the station.\n\nIn 1990, \"Imparja Local News\" was launched as a fifteen-minute insert of local news into the national bulletin. The station also covered the Northern Territory general election live from its Alice Springs studios. This followed the lead taken in 1989 when the station began to produce weather reports for parts of the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales, presented by Lavinia Hampton.\n\nBy 1993, Imparja's viewing audience had doubled to approximately 125,000 Australians. This in turn led to the increased allocation of government funding in 1994 to produce \"Yamba's Playtime\", which was the station's first in-house televisual production. Yamba's Playtime features the station's official mascot, \"Yamba\". Also in 1994, the Imparja board of directors established the Imparja Business Development Sub Committee, to monitor and provide strategic recommendations for areas of growth for the company.\n\nIn 1995, Imparja received the Telstra Indigenous Business Award for Business of the Year. Also in 1995, Imparja's satellite transmission moved from the Aussat A-Class satellites to the Optus B1 satellite, and the station's licence was renewed.\n\nTwo new in-house productions were launched in 1996. The first being the \"BRACS Program\", which was almost fully produced by Aboriginal communities, and \"Corroboree Rock\", an Aboriginal music program.\n\nImparja's parent company, Imparja Pty Ltd, converted to a proprietary company in 1997, whilst in the late 1990s, Imparja moved to digital satellite technology on the Optus Aurora platform. This meant that Imparja's satellite transmission moved from the Optus B1 satellite to the Optus C1 satellite.\n\nBy 2001 the station's coverage area had grown to include over 430,000 people. Around this time 'Imparja Info Channel' ('Channel 31') was launched, providing additional programming, news, and community information to remote Aboriginal communities. The Aboriginal programming on this channel later became known as Indigenous Community Television (ICTV). In 2007, the whole channel was replaced by National Indigenous Television (NITV).\n\nImparja faced criticism by a number of community groups in 2004, following the station's decision to introduce advertising for alcohol for the first time. The network pledged to donate 30% of the total income received from alcohol advertising towards alcohol and substance abuse programs in communities.\n\nIn 2005, \"Imparja National News\", which primarily covered the news in Alice Springs in addition to other national and international news stories, was axed. The move was taken in anticipation of the Remote Eastern & Central Australia TV1 licence area being merged with that of Darwin. Regulations imposed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority relating to minimum levels of local news coverage led to 2006 reinstatement of \"Imparja National News\". The news service began broadcasting again from the middle of February 2006, with Ryan Liddle as presenter.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, it was widely expected that the Australian Communications and Media Authority would merge the \"Darwin\" and \"Remote Eastern and Central Australia\" commercial television licence areas. This would have most likely seen Imparja Television become a Network Ten affiliate in Darwin. However, this did not eventuate. Instead PBL Media and Southern Cross Broadcasting, the two existing Darwin Commercial licence holders were invited to bid individually or together. Their successful joint bid used a company called Darwin Digital Television.\n\nOn 3 February 2008, Imparja Television updated its logo removing the emblem, which had been present on the logo for two decades. The logo change coincided with Imparja dropping Network Ten affiliation, becoming a sole Nine Network affiliate, in addition to axing \"Imparja National News\", and also adding Nine Network's dots to its new logo.\n\nOn 19 May 2010, the ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority) approved a licence for a new remote area digital-only TV channel, a joint venture by Imparja Pty Ltd and Southern Cross Central. It was launched on 30 June 2010 as \"Ten Central (CDT)\". It had two feeds, Ten Central North (QLD/NT) and Ten Central South (NSW/SA/Vic/Tas).\n\nIn December 2010, Imparja Television began broadcasting on terrestrial digital TV and the new VAST satellite service. This expansion included the establishment of two feeds for these platforms, Imparja North (Qld/NT) and Imparja South (NSW/SA/Vic/Tas). As of 2010, their programming is exactly the same.\n\nImparja Pty Ltd also began to launch digital channels 9Go! and 9Gem.\n\nAs of the moment, Imparja continues to stream the HD feed of 9Gem, which was rebranded as a standard definition channel (9Gem later launched a separate HD channel in 2019) in Nine Network-only on 26 November 2015 in its metropolitan and Darwin stations, along with 9Life and the relaunch of 9HD. There are currently no plans at this stage for Imparja to launch an HD simulcast or introduce 9Life to its viewers. It will continue with its existing lineup of three broadcast channels.\n\nImparja Television is a sole Nine Network affiliate. The station previously broadcast both Nine and Ten programming, however it stopped broadcasting Network Ten programming on 3 February 2008. Imparja Television has also aired original programs produced by local Aboriginal community members, such as Bush Mechanics and the children's program \"Yamba's Playtime\". Imparja also airs programming relating to local Australian rules football and community sports, as well as news updates and religious \"thought for the day\" programs. Imparja Television also regularly broadcasts films created by the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association, which is a shareholder of its parent company.\n\nImparja's programming schedule is currently based on the Nine Network schedule for Brisbane (based on Eastern Standard Time). Prior to February 2008, scheduling was generally based on Central Standard Time, reflecting its Alice Springs-based heritage. As a result, programs are now broadcast half an hour earlier than they previously would have been under the previous arrangement.\n\nImparja does not currently produce its own evening regional news bulletin. In 2008, Imparja replaced \"Imparja National News\" – a 30-minute, weeknightly program combining local and national/international news – with local news updates, plus a 30-minute local news magazine program, \"Footprints\" (which later ceased production in 2009). The news updates were presented by Emma Groves from 2014 until July 2016. This brings Imparja's daily news service roughly into line with its competitor in the Remote Eastern and Central Australia licence area, Southern Cross Central (QQQ).\n\nThe 6:00 pm (AEST) time slot is filled by a simulcast of \"Nine News Queensland\". Imparja cites its geographic distribution, with a majority of the remote licence area's viewers now located in Queensland, as a \"key factor\" in selecting the Queensland bulletin. In 2009 Imparja began airing the Darwin edition of Nine News live at 6:30 pm (AEST) on weekdays, immediately following the Brisbane edition, in place of \"A Current Affair\" – thereby restoring a Northern Territory-based bulletin to the station.\n\nImparja airs most sports coverage from the Nine Network, including rugby league, cricket, golf and tennis. The station also broadcast motorsport and Australian rules football coverage until 2008.\n\nImparja Television broadcasts throughout most of the Northern Territory, and also to some remote parts of Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania and Norfolk Island. It is generally available by satellite on the VAST or Optus Aurora platforms, though in some locations it is broadcast terrestrially. Imparja Television has the largest geographic range of any commercial television network in Australia. Imparja is also received on the Spirit of Tasmania Bass Strait Ferries.\n\nImparja Television was previously available in New Zealand until March 2008 when the New Zealand government pressured the Australian government to remove the service from the satellite footprint that includes New Zealand.\n\nThe total population serviced by Imparja Television is over 700,000 people, boasting the largest footprint in the southern hemisphere.\n\nImparja is also available in Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea through the HiTRON subscription television service.\n\nImparja Television's first logo was developed from a painting produced by an Arrernte artist and traditional owner. The logo symbolised the MacDonnell Ranges, the Todd River and the Yeperenye caterpillar. An updated version designed by Bruce Dunlop Associates debuted on 30 January 2006, adding a blue sphere behind the emblem. When Imparja re-affiliated with Nine Network, the long-time emblem was replaced by the Nine Network dots.\n\n"}

It goes from State Route 210 in La Verne east to Interstate 215 in San Bernardino, passing through Claremont, Upland, Rancho Cucamonga, Fontana and Rialto along Foothill Boulevard. In San Bernardino, it is the part of Fifth Street west of H Street (at the Interstate 215 interchange).\n\nThe route begins as Foothill Boulevard at the interchange with SR 210 in the city of La Verne. SR 66 heads southeast for a few miles before entering Pomona and turning due east. The highway continues into the city of Claremont, passing by Claremont Colleges, before crossing into Upland, San Bernardino County.\n\nIn Upland, SR 66 passes by Cable Airport to the south, continuing due east. The highway intersects SR 83 before entering Rancho Cucamonga, where state maintenance of SR 66 currently ends. Foothill Boulevard continues east through Rancho Cucamonga through an interchange with I-15 before entering Fontana, and passing well north of the California Speedway. Foothill Boulevard continues east into Rialto, where the SR 66 designation resumes. SR 66 continues east into San Bernardino, before curving to the north as 5th Street and terminating at I-215 south of downtown.\n\nCalifornia's legislature has relinquished state control of the segment from the Pomona–Claremont line east to the Fontana–Rialto line, and turned it over to local control.\n\nSR 66 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, although it is neither a freeway nor an expressway. SR 66 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.\n\nAs a state route, SR 66 was added to the state highway system in the 1964 state highway renumbering, from SR 30 around San Dimas to San Bernardino. By 2013, the portion from east of Pomona to the eastern boundary of Rialto had been relinquished to the various cities that the route passed through.\n\n"}

The city of Veles is the seat of Veles Municipality.\n\nVilazora was initially the Paeonian city Bylazora from the period of early Classical Antiquity. The city's name was Βελισσός \"Velissos\" in Ancient Greek.\nUnder Turkish rule it became a township (\"kaza\") called Köprülü in the Üsküp \"sanjak\" (one of the administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire). From 1877 to 1912 the \"sandjak\" was part of the Kosovo vilayet. It played an important part in Ottoman history, as it was where six Grand Viziers hailed, and is still known as Köprülü in Turkish. From 1929 to 1941, Veles was part of the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. After World War II, the city was known as Titov Veles after Yugoslavian president Josip Broz Tito, but the 'Titov' was removed in 1996. Cars registered in Veles were identified by the code \"TV\" (Titov Veles), which was changed as late as 2000 to \"VE\".\n\nThe area of present-day Veles has been inhabited for over a millennium. In antiquity, it was a Paionian city called Bylazora, and contained a substantial population of Thracians and possibly Illyrians. It was then part of the Byzantine Empire, and at times the First and Second Bulgarian Empire. It became part of the Kingdom of Serbia at the end of the 13th century, while during the Serbian Empire (1345–71) it was an estate of Jovan Oliver and subsequently the Mrnjavčević family until Ottoman annexation after the Battle of Rovine (1395). Before the Balkan Wars, it was a township (kaza) with the name \"Köprülü\", part of the Sanjak of Üsküp.\n\nSome identify Veles with the Velitza of which Saint Clement of Ohrid was bishop.\nThe \"Annuario Pontificio\" identifies Veles instead with the Diocese of Bela, a suffragan of the Metropolitan Latin Archdiocese of Achrida (Ohrid) in Bulgaria, and lists it, as no longer a residential diocese, among the Latin titular bishoprics. It is probably in Bosnia and Hercegovina (modern Velika?).\n\nThrough North Macedonia Veles is known as industrial center and recently, as a leader in the implementing of IT in the local administration in North Macedonia.\n\nVeles is a place of poetry, culture, history and tradition, as well as a city with plentiful and precious cultural heritage and centuries old churches.\n\nVeles is a municipality of 55,000 residents.\nThe geographic location of the city of Veles makes it suitable for hiking and camping, especially at the west side of the city. One such location is the tranquil village Bogomila. Nearby there is the man made lake Mladost, which is known as the city's recreational centre.\n\nVeles made international news in 2016 when it was revealed that a group of teenagers in the city were controlling over 100 websites producing fake news articles in support of U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump, which were heavily publicised on the social media site Facebook.\nTwo TV stations operate in Veles -Channel 21 & Zdravkin- and many radio stations.\n\nVeles has many sports teams, the most popular of which are :\n\nVeles (city) is twinned with three other Balkanic towns :\n\nOther forms of partnership :\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1922938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922938", "title": "Caledonian Forest", "text": "Caledonian Forest\n\nThe Caledonian Forest is the name given to the former (ancient old-growth) temperate rainforest of Scotland. \n\nThe Scots pines of the Caledonian Forest are directly descended from the first pines to arrive in Scotland following the Late Glacial; arriving about 7000 BC. The forest reached its maximum extent about 5000 BC, after which the Scottish climate became wetter and windier. This changed climate reduced the extent of the forest significantly by 2000 BC. From that date, human actions (including the grazing effects of sheep and deer) reduced it to its current extent.\n\nToday, that forest exists as 35 remnants, as authenticated by Steven & Carlisle (1959) (or 84 remnants, including later subjective subdivisions of the 35) covering about or . The Scots pines of these remnants are, by definition, directly descended from the first pines to arrive in Scotland following the ice age. These remnants have adapted genetically to different Scottish environments, and as such, are globally unique; their ecological characteristics form an unbroken, 9000-year chain of natural evolution with a distinct variety of soils, vegetation, and animals.\n\nTo a great extent the remnants survived on land that was either too steep, too rocky, or too remote to be agriculturally useful. The largest remnants are in Strathspey and Strath Dee on highly acidic, freely drained glacial deposits that are of little value for cultivation and domestic stock. An examination of the earliest maps of Scotland suggests that the extent of the Caledonian Forest remnants has changed little since 1600.\n\nFollowing the last glacial period, trees began to recolonise what is now the British Isles over a land bridge which is now beneath the Strait of Dover. Forests of this type were found all over what is now the island of Great Britain for a few thousand years, before the climate began to slowly warm in the Atlantic period, and the temperate coniferous forests began retreating north into the Scottish Highlands, the last remaining climatic region suitable for them in the British Isles (see Climate of Scotland).\n\nThe native pinewoods that formed this westernmost outpost of the taiga of post-glacial Europe are estimated to have covered as a vast wilderness of Scots pine, birch, rowan, aspen, juniper, oak and a few other hardy species. On the west coast, oak and birch predominated in a temperate rainforest ecosystem rich in ferns, mosses and lichens.\n\nThe name comes from Pliny the Elder who reveals that 30 years after the Roman invasion of Britain their knowledge of it did not extend beyond the neighbourhood of \"silva caledonia\". He gives no information about where the \"silva caledonia\" was, but the known extent of the Roman occupation suggest that it was north of the River Clyde and west of the River Tay.\n\nIn the Matter of Britain, the forest is the site of one of King Arthur's Twelve Battles, according to the \"Historia Brittonum\", in which the battle is called \"Cat Coit Celidon\". Scholars Rachel Bromwich and Marged Haycock suggest that the army of trees animated by sorcerers in the Old Welsh poem \"Cad Goddeu\" (\"Battle of the Trees\") are intended to be the Caledonian Forest.\n\nIn related Merlin literature, the figure of Myrddin Wyllt retreated to these woods in his madness after the Battle of Arfderydd in the year 573. He fled from the alleged wrath of the king of Strathclyde, Rhydderch Hael, after the slaying of Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio. This is written in the two Merlinic poems in Middle Welsh \"Yr Oinau\" and \"Yr Afallenau\" in the Black Book of Carmarthen. The forest is also the retreat of another character named Lailoken from the \"Vita Kentigerni\", who also fled into the woods in a fit of madness and who may be the original model for Myrddin Wyllt.\n\nIn the Middle Welsh story \"Culhwch and Olwen\", the main character Culhwch is the son of a king named Celyddon Wledig, who may or may not be related to the forest in name. Another figure from the same story, Cyledyr Wyllt hints at a close relationship of the forest being a retreat for people who suffered from a special kind of madness or \"gwyllt\" (Irish \"geilt\"). In line 994 to 996 of the story, it is briefly explained, \"a Chyledyr Wyllt y uab, a llad Nwython a oruc a diot y gallon, a chymhell yssu callon y dat, ac am hynny yd aeth Kyledyr yg gwyllt\" (\"and his son Kyledyr the Wild. Gwynn killed Nwython and cut out his heart, and forced Kyledyr to eat his father's heart, and that is how Kyledyr went mad\"). Though not named directly, the very name Kyledyr Wyllt is close to the two related notions of the forest of \"Celyddon\" being where people suffering madness or \"gwyllt\" hide.\n\nBeing a unique ecosystem in the British Isles, the Caledonian Pinewoods are home to some of the islands' rarest wildlife. It is considered to be one of the last remaining wildernesses in the British Isles.\n\nBreeding bird species in Caledonian pine forests found breeding nowhere else in the British Isles:\n\nBreeding bird species in Caledonian pine forests rare elsewhere in the British Isles:\n\nMammal species present in Caledonian pine forests:\n\n\nMammal species extinct in Caledonian pine forests:\n\nA review of the native pinewoods of Scotland \"Steven & Carlisle (1959)\" highlighted the plight of the remaining 35 ancient pinewood sites, many of which had been damaged by felling, fire and intensive grazing from sheep and deer. A later review in the 1980s showed that further damage had occurred through ploughing and planting with non-native conifers with less than 12,000 ha of the ancient habitat remaining. A subsequent guide to the ancient pinewoods reviews the conservation story and provides a summary of the management in each site as well as a guide on how to reach all the woods using public transport, walking, and cycling. Much of remaining Caledonian pine forest is fully protected, and much of the forest now lies within the Cairngorms National Park. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and Forestry and Land Scotland also own several areas of pinewood on their reserves. One of the largest remaining areas is Ballochbuie Forest on the Balmoral Estate, which is protected as a Special Area of Conservation under the European Union Habitats Directive.\n\nScientific research continues on the ecology of the Caledonian Forest and its restoration. Populations of the rare groundcover, \"Linnaea borealis\", may be too isolated from one another to produce viable seed. Diversity of fungi has also been affected by the decrease in habitat. The agaric fungus \"Mycena purpureofusca\" is commonly found in Caledonian pine woods, and it is considered an indicator species for that habitat type. Fire appears to increase the natural recruitment of Scots pine seedlings.\n\nThe charity Trees for Life (Scotland) has been working to conserve the remaining forest, and reforest areas where it has been lost, using fences to prevent deer from eating saplings. This involves the reintroduction of the full range of native flora, including fungi that assist soil regeneration.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest to reintroduce animals which are currently extinct in Great Britain, back into Caledonian pine forests. Corporations have been set up to persuade the government to allow this. The long-running campaign to reintroduce the Eurasian beaver to Knapdale in Argyll has been successful, and there is some support for the reintroduction of the grey wolf and Eurasian lynx.\n\nRecently, some landowners have announced plans to build large game reserves on their land and release the species within them. Paul Lister plans to release Eurasian lynx, brown bear, grey wolf, elk, wild boar and species already present in Scotland into a huge enclosure at his estate, Alladale Wilderness Reserve, although releasing top predators such as wolves and bears has become a difficult proposition with local and national regulations. An initial trial enclosure of was built with elk, wild boar, red deer and roe deer.\n\nBain (2013) lists 38 ancient pinewood sites in Britain which have been identified as the most genuinely native and natural. All of them occur in the Scottish Highlands. The Caledonian Pinewood Inventory breaks these down into 84 smaller sub-units of the main sites. In March 2019, as part of the implementation of the Forestry and Land Management (Scotland) Act 2018, the Scottish Government listed 84 sites as Caledonian pinewood in regulations, given below.\n\n"}

{"id": "1922945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922945", "title": "Black Terror", "text": "Black Terror\n\nThe Black Terror is a fictional comic book superhero who originally appeared in \"Exciting Comics\" #9, published by Nedor Comics in January 1941. The character was popular, and on the strength of the Black Terror's sales, Nedor made \"Exciting Comics\" a monthly magazine starting with issue #11 (July 1941).\n\nThe Black Terror was the most popular superhero in Nedor's stable, and appeared in a quarterly solo comic book as well as the lead feature in \"America's Best Comics\" and \"Exciting Comics\" until 1949.\n\nSome Black Terror stories were written by Patricia Highsmith before she became an acclaimed novelist. The character has been revived by various publishers over the years, including AC Comics, Eclipse Comics, America's Best Comics, and Dynamite Entertainment.\n\nThe Black Terror's secret identity was pharmacist Bob Benton, who formulated a chemical he called \"formic ethers\", which gave him various superpowers. He used these powers to fight crime with his sidekick, Tim Roland, together known as the \"Terror Twins\". His love interest is secretary Jean Starr, who initially despises Benton and loves the Black Terror, but later discovers that they're the same person.\n\nAccording to \"Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes\", \"The Black Terror has enemies ranging from Nazis to mad scientists like Thorg (he of the \"million dollar death ray\"), the femme fatale Lady Serpent (who has a hypnotic glance), and the Japanese scientist Hanura and his \"electro-hypnotizer\", which is used to assassinate American generals and admirals.\"\n\nWith the popularity of superheroes fading in the late 40s, the Black Terror's series ended with issue #27 (June 1949).\n\nIn 1983 AC Comics revised the Black Terror, starting in their \"Americomics\" title. In it, now-retired Bob Benton (called Mark Benton in this version) returns to action after an attempt to shake him down for protection money leads to the death of his wife. He would operate as an over-the-top vigilante, now just called the \"Terror\". Later, most likely due to trademark issues, he became a criminal enforcer known as the \"Terrorist\".\n\nIn Roy Thomas' \"Alter Ego\" mini-series from 1986, several Golden Age characters were used, but renamed. The Black Terror (renamed \"The Holy Terror\") made an appearance.\n\nBob Benton made a single appearance in the fourth issue of Darkline Comics' \"Dark Adventures\". In the script by Vic Peterson and art by Thompson O'Rourke, Benton's exposure to his secret formula has made him ageless and sleepless, and he begins a new war on crime under the name \"Terror Knight.\"\n\nEclipse Comics did a three-issue mini-series \"revival\" of the Black Terror in 1989. In this series, the character is an undercover FBI agent operating against organized crime who would dress up like the Black Terror for certain operations. He had no superpowers or any connection to the original character.\n\nThe Black Terror, along with other heroes from Nedor Comics, were revived by Alan Moore in 2001 in his series \"Tom Strong\", published by America's Best Comics. This revival set the characters on a parallel world called Terra Obscura, which was also the title of the resulting mini-series.\n\nIn \"Tom Strong\" #11, Moore and co-creator Chris Sprouse more fully introduce the idea of Terra Obscura being a parallel Earth, \"but in our own dimension. In our own galaxy.\" In this issue, Tom Strange is revealed to have run across the Milky Way for 30 years to reach Strong for help in stopping an alien menace that killed or imprisoned most of the science heroes of Terra Obscura. Strong himself theorized that the duplicate Earth \"must be due to some near-inconceivable fluke of mathematics, of statistical probability.\"\n\nThe parallel Earth, as revealed by Strange, was formed much as our own, except that once Earth had completely formed, something large collided and combined with it — a vast spacecraft. The pilot of the spacecraft survived in the Moon, until awakened by astronauts on July 20, 1969. It apparently followed them back to Earth, where it began construction of a ship to return home — by converting the entire Earth into a spaceship. In the process, it was engaged in battle by the members of SMASH. It killed some members, and trapped others in suspended animation for 30 years, until freed by the combined efforts of Tom Strong and Tom Strange.\n\nIn \"Tom Strong\" #12, it is revealed that the Black Terror had been killed in battle with the alien. However, Benton, a polymath, had transferred his consciousness into a computer program called Terror 2000.\n\nIn the \"Terra Obscura\" series, the Terror 2000 program institutes a crime prevention program in Invertica City, wherein technologically produced versions of the Black Terror (referred to as the Terror) fight crime. A corporation running the program tries to sell it to other cities in the US. Eventually, the Terror transfers its consciousness into the now deceased Tim and tries to acquire power from the returning Captain Future's spaceship. He is defeated by a time travelling version of his original self, the Black Terror.\n\nThe Black Terror is seen in the Mike Allred illustrated \"Stardust the Super Wizard\" story in Image Comics' \"Next Issue Project\" #1 (also known as \"Fantastic Comics\" #24, January 2008). He can be seen with many other notable Golden Age characters, including Daredevil, Miss Masque, the Green Lama, the Face, the Phantom, the Fighting Yank, and Samson, who headlines the book. He also made a small appearance on the cover and in some panels of \"Savage Dragon\" #141 (November 2008).\n\nIn June 2008, pulp publisher Wild Cat Books released \"Legends of the Golden Age\", a prose anthology featuring new stories of the Black Terror and Lev Gleason's Daredevil.\n\nBlack Terror was one of several Golden Age characters to appear in the comic book series \"Project Superpowers\", by writer Jim Krueger and artist Alex Ross. He was also the first in the series to get a spin-off series, written by Krueger with art by Mike Lilly. In the \"Black Terror\" series, which began in November 2008, the Terror leads a one-man assault on the White House in search of his lost partner, Tim. The series was cancelled at #14 in 2011. The character appears in the 2013 \"Masks\" series along other pulp heroes.\n\nThe 2009 Metahuman Press serial \"Out for Vengeance\" uses both the Black Terror and Black Fury as a basis for the character. He maintains the traditional secret identity and costume. The series is set in the modern day and involves Robert Benton suddenly finding himself young and semi-amnesiac in the city of New Salem.\n\nThe webcomic \"Heroes Inc.\" started in 2009 and takes place in an alternate reality where the allies of World War II lost the war. In present day, the American Crusader gathers DNA from Golden Age heroes in order to create a new generation of heroes. One of these Golden Age heroes is the Black Terror (now going by the alias Duncan Boone), who is currently on death row for first degree murder.\n\nIn February 2011, Broken Soul Press launched a webcomic called \"Curse of the Black Terror\". The comic is described as a superhero/noir story. The webcomic follows a re-imagined version of the Black Terror. Writer Curtis Lawson has stated that the story keeps the original Black Terror's history mostly intact and that his new Black Terror is a Legacy Hero. This new Black Terror features a new costume, but the same powers as the original. His identity has not been revealed. The visual re-design of the Black Terror in this webcomic was the work of artist Kundo Krunch.\n\nIn 2011 Eric M. Esquivel and Ander Sarabia created a version of The Black Terror called \"The Blackest Terror\"\", who is more of an urban revolutionary, obsessed with social justice, than a status-quo-enforcing superhero. Theirs is the first version of Robert Benton to be portrayed as an African-American. Blackest Terror also appears in their book \"Thor: Unkillable Thunder Christ\", also published by Moonstone Books.\n\nThe Black Terror appears alongside other Golden Age superheroes in the independent film \"Avenging Force: The Scarab\".\n\n"}

It is the world's largest industrial gas company by market share as well as revenue. Linde shares are traded in Germany and the United States, and included in those countries' DAX 30 and S&P 500 major stock market indices. \n\nThe Linde Group has over 600 affiliated companies in more than 100 countries, with customers in the industrial, retail, trade, science, research, and public sectors.\n\nIn September 2006 the company acquired its UK based competitor The BOC Group, and subsequently disposed of its non-gas interests. Linde's former materials handling business was rebranded as KION Group in September 2006 and sold in November 2006 to KKR and Goldman Sachs for €4bn. In March 2007 the BOC Edwards semiconductor equipment business was sold to CCMP Capital for €685m.\n\nLinde's revenue in 2016 were €16.948 billion, with 59,715 employees.\n\nFollowing the BOC acquisition, The Linde Group has become the world's largest industrial gas company. In 2005, Linde AG and BOC together had 21% of the world's market in industrial gases followed by Air Liquide with 19%, Praxair with 13%, Air Products & Chemicals with 10%, Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation with 4%, Airgas with 3% and Messer Group with 1%.\n\nThe Linde Group today has two principal business areas: gas (industrial gases and medical gases), and engineering. In the industrial gas area the group trades under a number of established brand names including Linde, AGA, BOC, TIG, MOX, Afrox and PanGas. HiQ is used as an identifier for high purity and premium specialty gases across all of these business brand names.\nIn the medical gas area, Linde is known with the following names, Linde Gas Therapeutics, AGA Medical, INO Therapeutics, Linde Homecare, Farmadomo and Life Gas.\n\nOn 21 June 1879, Carl von Linde founded the \"Gesellschaft für Linde's Eismaschinen Aktiengesellschaft\" to develop further his work in developing mechanical refrigeration systems for the brewing and food industries. Following success in this market, he moved on to developing lower temperature systems resulting in 1895 in a patent covering the liquefaction of air. Out of this work his company developed equipment for the separation of air and other gases. Linde's process was patented in 1902 and immediately exploited by the first large-scale air separation plant installed in Linde's work in Höllriegelskreuth, near Munich in 1903. In 1906, Carl Von Linde decided to expand his oxygen extraction company oversees, targeting America, where no other companies had attempted industrial scale oxygen extraction. He opened his first plant in America at Buffalo, New York in 1907, known as the Linde Air Products Factory.\n\nIn addition to plants for air separation, in 1906 Linde engineers started working with others on processes to separate the constituents of water gas. This work developed into capabilities in the recovery of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which were further key feedstocks for the emerging chemicals industry.\n\nIn addition to his interests in refrigeration, Carl von Linde had also partnered with Hugo Güldner and Georg von Krauß and others in 1904 to form the Güldner Motoren-Gesellschaft mbH in Munich, which was moved to Aschaffenburg in 1906. Linde took full ownership of the company in 1929, and from this origin developed a business manufacturing first engines and tractors, and then from the 1950s onwards, a range of mechanical handling equipment such as fork lift trucks. Linde also acquired the Aktiengesellschaft für Industriegasverwertung (english: Corporation for Industry Gas Utilization ), commonly referred to as the Heylandt Works.\n\nIn the years of Nazi Germany, Linde AG benefited from the country's attempt to become self-sufficient by refraining from imports of synthetic petrol and rubber. In 1935 general manager Friedrich Linde received the title of \"Wehrwirtschaftsführer\", which on the one hand underlined the national importance of Linde AG and on the other hand allowed the company to further benefit from the enlarged armament program. Among the closest colleagues of the general director was Dr. Alfred Hess, plant manager in Höllriegelskreuth and uncle of Deputy Führer of the Nazi Party Rudolf Hess.\n\nBefore and during World War II, all departments of Linde AG were in some way involved in the armaments production: The Heylandt-Gesellschaft für Apparatebau supplied the German rocket program, other branches produced welding equipment and engines for the armaments industry. In 1941 Linde manufactured oxygen and helium installations for IG Farben at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Three further planned installations were not installed due to the course of war. According to estimates of the company for mid-1944, between 400 and 500 people were used as forced labourers in production plants.\n\nLinde Air Products, since 1917 part of the Union Carbide & Carbon Corporation sued another company in 1950 for violating their patent on a welding process by simply substituting a similar material. In \"Graver Tank & Manufacturing Co. v. Linde Air Products Co.\", the United States Supreme Court established the doctrine of equivalents which found that, while not in the literal scope of the patent, the concept discovered by Linde was still being unfairly encroached upon without compensation.\n\nA complex history of takeovers, mergers and divestments occurred, and in 2000 completed the acquisition of AGA AB of Sweden. This was followed in 2004 with the divestment of the original core of the Linde business – the refrigeration division – to Carrier Corporation of the USA. In March 2006, Linde made a proposal to acquire The BOC Group for €11.7 billion in cash. The acquisition was completed on 5 September 2006. Following the acquisition, the combined gas and engineering group was rebranded as \"The Linde Group\", and the materials handling activities separated and rebranded as KION Group. It was also announced that the BOC Edwards equipment business was to be sold.\n\nIn 2008, the head office of Linde AG was relocated from its historic headquarters in Wiesbaden to Munich; the new company headquarters are located in the Angerhof building in downtown Munich; the Group's new name is The Linde Group.\n\nIn 2010 the group acquired over 95% of the shares of Sri Lanka based, Ceylon Oxygen Ltd.\n\nIn June 2011, PT Linde Indonesia, a subsidiary of the Linde group, announced its plan to build an air separation plant worth Rp.1 trillion ($117.33 million) in Cilegon, Banten, to supply industrial gas to PT Krakatau Posco's steel plant.\n\nIn January 2012, the company acquired the Continental-European homecare business of the industrial gases company Air Products at an enterprise value of €590 million. This business achieved annual sales of €210 million in 2011. The transaction comprises Air Products' homecare operations in Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal and Spain with around 850 employees. In August 2012, the company acquired Lincare Holdings Inc., a healthcare gas provider in the USA for US$4.6 billion. Lincare Holdings had sales of US$1.8 billion in 2011. In August, the Linde Group completed the acquisition and became the largest home care gas supplier in North America. In December, the company acquired homecare company Calea France SAS.\n\nIn February 2016, Lincare Holdings acquired American HomePatient, Inc. In December, Linde Korea completed the acquisition of Air Liquide Korea's industrial merchant & electronics and liquid bulk air gases divisions, based in South Korea.\n\nOn August 9, 2019 Linde has partnered with CarbonCure Technologies.\nIn August 2016 it was publicly announced that the German company was in official negotiations to merge with the American competitor Praxair, which would form the world's largest gas supplier. The following month in September the negotiations were halted and suspended indefinitely. As of mid December 2016 Praxair resumed negotiations with Linde for a potential merger. In late December an official announcement was made that Praxair had reached an agreement to merge with Linde in a deal valued at $35 billion and with an overall merger value of $65 billion. In April 2017 Linde again rejected a request for a shareholder vote at its annual general meeting in May – this is the second time the company has rejected Praxair's request. In May 2017, both companies reached a deal in principle on an all-share merger of equals valued at $75 billion, the deal will still need the approval of Praxair's board of directors as well as Linde's management and executive boards and if approved, will form a new holding company. In early June 2017, both companies agreed to the merger.\n\nOn October 31, 2018 the Company declared that business combination between Praxair and Linde AG had been successfully completed except finalising divestitures required by the respective antitrust authorities.\n\nOn March 1, 2019 the Company declared it completed divestitures required by US antitrust authorities and will now fully integrate its business globally.\n\nLinde AG comprises three subgroups. The largest division, Gases, has four operating segments, Western Europe, the Americas, Asia & Eastern Europe, and South Pacific & Africa. These segments are subdivided into eight Regional Business Units (RBUs).\n\nThe Gases Division also includes the two Global Business Units (GBUs) – Healthcare (medical gases) and Tonnage (on-site) – and the two Business Areas (BAs) – Merchant & Packaged Gases (liquefied and cylinder gases) and Electronics (electronic gases).\n\nLinde Industrial Gases produces and distributes the atmospheric gases oxygen, nitrogen and argon, all of which are manufactured in Linde's air separation plants.\n\nThe product range includes hydrogen, acetylene, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, shielding gases for welding applications, noble gases and specialty gases.\n\nLinde Healthcare provides pharmaceutical and medical gas products and services for healthcare professionals.\n\nLinde Healthcare is present in 70 countries. Pharmaceutical and medical gases are used in the diagnosis or treatment of a number of clinical conditions. In addition to oxygen therapy, aerosol therapy and anaesthesia, Linde Healthcare provides medical gas for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, sleep apnoea and pain.\n\nThe Engineering Division develops process plants in the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) business worldwide. Linde Engineering focus on market segments such as plants for the production of hydrogen and synthesis gas, oxygen and olefins as well as plants for natural gas treatment.\n\nThe group has more than 1,000 process engineering patents and 4,000 completed plant projects.\nThe product range includes:\n\n\nGist Limited, headquartered at Chineham Business Park, Basingstoke, offers supply chain services including end-to-end management and customer fulfilment through transport and warehousing. The company employs approximately 5,000 people in 40 locations in Great Britain, France, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and the USA, with customers including Marks & Spencer, Waitrose & Partners, Tesco, Starbucks, Morrisons, EAT, Young's Seafood and Arla Foods.\n\nGist also manages Global Freight movements across the world for a variety of clients, including Intergreen and Manchester Tank. \n\nGist Limited's UK operations reported an annual revenue of £437m in December 2017.\n\nIn partnership with Brake, Gist's Child Road Safety scheme, established in 2011, has seen more than 120,000 safety sessions delivered to children across the UK, warning of the dangers of HGVs on the road.\n\nThe history of Gist Limited dates back as far as 1920, when George Littmoden began moving fruit and vegetables to Covent Garden market by horse and cart. George's business, called GL Baker, began transporting fresh fruit for Marks & Spencer in 1932. In 1969, BOC acquired GL Baker, after it expressed interest in its use of liquid nitrogen in chilled containers. The new company was titled BOC Transhield. The new company consisted of 1,100 employees, operating from five locations across the UK. The company was renamed BOC Distribution Services in 1991, before being rebranded as Gist Limited (Gist being the 'heart of logistics') and moving its headquarters to Chineham in 2001.\n\nAfter The Linde Group took over BOC in 2006, it also acquired Gist. Following the group's merger with Praxair to form Linde plc, Gist continues to operate as a separate entity under Linde.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1922959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922959", "title": "Fender amplifier", "text": "Fender amplifier\n\nLeo Fender began building guitar amplifiers before he started manufacturing electric guitars. The first of these were the K&F models, produced between 1945 and 1946. The early K&F and Fender amplifiers relied upon vacuum tube circuitry, with the company adding solid-state models in the late 1960s.\n\nThe first \"Fender\" amplifiers were manufactured by Leo Fender and Doc Kauffman, doing business as the K&F Manufacturing Corporation. In a steel case, most were finished in a \"gray crinkle\" finish, baked in the Kauffman family oven. They were made in three sizes, 1×8\" (one 8-inch speaker), 1×10\", and 1×15\". They are all very rare today and few have survived.\n\nThe first amplifiers made in-house by the Fender Electric Instrument Company have been dubbed the Woodie series, built in 1946 through 1948. They included the Model 26 Deluxe, the Princeton, and the Professional.\n\nFender amplifiers became established with the tweed series, wood cases covered in varnished cotton twill in the manner of suitcases of the era. (The nickname is a misnomer, as tweed is a coarse woollen fabric, often woven in a twill pattern.) They were produced for more than a decade. The first cloth used was an off-white fabric, followed by a horizontal-stripe two-tone pattern, and finally a two-tone twill.\n\nThe twill covering was first used in 1946 on the Dual Professional, a twin 10\" 6L6-powered model of which only 400 were made before being renamed \"the Super Amp\" in 1948. These early models are referred to as \"TV-Fronts\" due to the shape of the cabinet when viewed from above. The Dual Pro was the first twin-speaker amplifier, and also the first to employ a finger-jointed pine cabinet and the amp with a top-facing control panel. The construction of the chassis was changed as well, mounted to the back with the tubes pointed down, as opposed to having the chassis mounted on the top of the cabinet. This has the benefit of providing ease of access to the inside while providing a strong top.\n\nFender largely ceased the twill covering in 1960, though the Harvard continued until 1963, and the Champ until 1964.\n\nAt the beginning of the \"tweed\" era, Fender constructed many of its cabinets in \"TV front\" style, changing around 1950 predominantly to the \"wide panel\", where the top and bottom panels are wider than the side. Fender later constructed them with \"narrow panel\", in which all the panels have more or less the same width. Toward the end, despite keeping such construction, Fender utilized Tolex to cover its amps.\n\nThe Brownface series was introduced in 1959 and discontinued in 1963. This period marked the beginning of Fender's use of Tolex to cover amp cabinets. The name 'brownface' stems from the brown-colored control panels, common to both the brown- and cream/blonde- Tolex-covered amps. The brownface amps originally featured a dark maroon or \"oxblood\" grillcloth, which was changed to \"wheat\" in 1962-63.\n\nThe shift from tweed to Tolex occurred in limited production in 1960. The tolex on the earliest versions in this era was pinkish brown and rough textured. There were only six amplifiers covered in tolex originally, the Professional Series: Bandmaster, Concert, Pro, Super, Twin (production halted Feb-May 1960, resumed as the blonde Twin) and Vibrasonic. These were considered a step above the student models (Champ, Harvard, Princeton) which remained tweed-covered in 1960. \n\nGrillcloth was initially the same as used in the previous tweed era, maroon with gold stripe. Beginning in mid to late 1961, Fender introduced another color combination: a smoother but still light brown tolex with a dark maroon or \"oxblood\" grillcloth. By mid-1961, after this short-lived look, Fender was using the darker brown tolex which was a mainstay for many of the mid-1961 to 1963 amps. Between 1961 and 1963, there were three different grillcloth colors: wheat, brown, and maroon and many tolex-grille color combinations are found suggesting that Fender was not reluctant to use up whatever stocks of materials were on hand.\n\nThe Brown amplifiers included all of the all-in-one combo models except the flagship Twin and Vibrasonic, and the little Champ which retained its \"tweed\" (twill) covering. The Blonde amplifiers included all of the piggyback Fender amps (the Tremolux, Bassman, Showman, and Bandmaster) as well as the Twin and Vibrasonic combos. Two different colors of grillcloth were featured on the blondes, oxblood and wheat. There are several experimental Fender Tweed amps in blonde. While the majority of the piggybacks were produced in blonde tolex, there are a few examples of the brown tolex Bassman amplifiers.\n\nAccomplishments for the company's amplifier division during these years include the introduction of the stand-alone spring reverb unit in 1961, followed by incorporation of the reverb circuit within a combo-amp design with the 1963 Vibroverb. Other changes include the shift of the top-of-the-line model from the traditional Twin to include other models, like the Vibrasonic in early 1960, as well as the blonde Showman in 1961. Fender began using silicon rectifiers to reduce heat and voltage sag caused by tube rectifiers, and introduced an all-new, very complex Tremolo circuit (or, as it referrd by Fender - \"vibrato\").\n\nThe Deluxe made the transition in 1961. The circuit was also changed to include a tremolo effect, and the output was increased.\n\nAs the brown-era wore on, the plight of the smaller amps was varied. They all remained in name at least except for the 1x10\" Harvard which was not continued through 1961. The 1x8\" Champ-Amp remained a tweed-covered through 1963 and into 64 when it made the change to black tolex. The 1x10\" Vibrolux remained a tweed amp until it was upgraded in 1961 to a single 12\" speaker powered by a duet of 6L6 power tubes and a larger output transformer. Also upgraded from tweed was the Princeton which acquired its brown tolex in 1962 along with a completely redesigned, more powerful twin-6v6 circuit and a larger speaker array: 1x10\".\n\nThe Blackface amplifiers were produced between 1963 and 1967 (some units continued to be made into early 1968). The earliest blackface piggyback and large combo amps (Twin) had bodies covered in blonde tolex, with the new black control panel. The white control knobs continued briefly before giving way to black skirted \"hat shaped\" numbered knobs. New circuitry featuring bright switches. In 1964 the piggyback units began to be covered in black tolex. The blackface cosmetics were phased out at the end of 1967 (though some continued to be made on into early 1968); they returned for a brief period in 1981 before their discontinuation the following year.\nJohn used a circa 1963 non-reverb Fender black face Deluxe amp. It can be seen in the Revolution clip and in Hey Jude Clip. He loved the amp and it had a different sound from the Deluxe Reverb model.\n\nBlackfaced cosmetics do not necessarily mean \"pre-CBS\" since the CBS company takeover took place in 1965 and amps with blackfaced cosmetics were produced up to 1967. After the buyout the front panels were changed from \"Fender Electric Instrument Co.\" to \"Fender Musical Instruments\". No real changes were made to the amps until the silverfaced amps of 1968 where certain circuit changes made them less desirable than the blackfaced amps. This affected some models more than others. For example, the Twin Reverb and Super Reverb combos, along with the Dual Showman Reverb and Bandmaster Reverb \"piggyback\" heads were equipped with a master volume control while other models such as the Deluxe Reverb were not altered in any way except for the change in cosmetics.\n\nSilverface cosmetics do not necessarily denote silverface circuitry, however. Leo Fender was notorious for tweaking his designs. During the transitional period from late 1967 to mid-1968, the circuit designs of the Twin Reverb and Super Reverb were altered to eliminate an uncommon but serious oscillation in the signal chain. These changes took some months to finalize, as Leo worked through some designs, and happened after the cosmetic changes. Furthermore, the schematic and tube charts that shipped with these models did not always reflect the actual circuitry. Fender had many leftover AB763 (blackface) tube charts left over well into 1969 and shipped these charts with silverface models.\n\nSave for a few series (such as HotRod series), a majority of modern Fender amplifiers sports blackface cosmetics.\n\nFender Silverface amplifiers were built between 1967 and 1981. They are often referred to as Silverface (or Chromeface) because of their brushed aluminum face plate.\n\nThe first Silverface amps, manufactured between 1967 and 1969, had an aluminum frame (trim, known as a \"drip edge\") around the grillcloth, mid-1960s \"tailed\" amp logo and the AB763 blackface circuit. An even rarer feature were the vertical, narrow black lines, which separated knob groups in the control panel. This cosmetic detail (later referred to as \"blackline\") was quickly abandoned. All of the Silverface amps generally had blue labels on the face plate, but in some rare exceptions (such as the Bronco) the colour was red instead. Some transitional models produced before the \"tailless\" period in 1973 featured the AC568 circuit, still retaining the tailed Fender amp decal introduced in 1964.\n\nIn 1973 CBS changed the \"tailed\" Fender amp logo to the modern-looking \"tailless\" style (which was first introduced in 1967 on the student Bronco amp). A master volume knob and a pull-out \"boost\" pot were added on some amplifiers, followed by ultralinear output transformers and a \"scripted tailless\" amp decal (featuring a \"Made in USA\" script in the bottom) in 1977; the power was increased between 70 and 135 watts on certain models.\n\nAll Silverface models usually came with a sparkling silver/blue grillcloth (some later models had a non-standard sparkling silver/orange grillcloth, and a black grillcloth was even fitted to some production runs). The Silverface control face plate was discontinued in 1981 and replaced by the second series of the blackface amps. \n\nFender made a limited-edition Mini-Twin practice amplifier modeled after the mid-70s Twin Reverb models in 1996. The Silverface Edition MT-10 had the authentic look right down to the grillcloth. This 1-watt Twin featured 3 in. speakers, \"skirted\" style Fender knobs for Gain, Volume, Tone and Power and included a tilt-back stand.\n\nIn 2013, Fender released the silverface '68 Custom amplifiers as a part of their Vintage Modified series, modeled after the original drip-edge silverfaced amps of 1968. Models included the Twin Reverb, Deluxe Reverb, and Princeton Reverb, and a Vibrolux Reverb was added to the line the following year. Each amp incorporates reverb and tremolo on both channels. Other features include a Custom channel (which has a modified Bassman tone stack giving modern players greater tonal flexibility with pedals), quicker gain onset and reduced negative feedback for greater touch sensitivity.\n\nFender's first transistor amplifiers were introduced in 1966. At the time they were the company's \"flagship\" range and aimed to make the tube-based designs obsolete. The amplifiers were naturally given traditional Fender model names, earliest including 'Dual Showman', 'Twin Reverb', and 'Bassman'. Other products in the line were the 'Solid-State Reverb Unit' and the 'Solid-State Public-Address System'. 'Super Reverb', 'Pro Reverb', 'Vibrolux Reverb' and 'Deluxe Reverb' amplifiers followed in 1967.\n\nThe amplifiers were mainly designed by Robert \"Bob\" Rissi, Sawa Jacobson and Paul Spranger, who came up with the novel idea of making a heatsink to operate like a chimney to achieve increased and non-restricted airflow. Paul also designed the distinctive angled chassis and overall cosmetic styling. He was granted patents for both accounts.\n\nIn 1969 more transistor amplifiers were introduced, including the 'Zodiac' series and the behemoth 'Super Showman System'. Seth Lover, the legendary designer of the Gibson \"P.A.F.\" pickup, and another former Gibson employee, Richard Chauncey Evans, were hired to help in designing the latter series, which consisted of an 'SS-1000' preamplifier head and 'XFL-1000' and 'XFL-2000' self-powered speaker cabinets. The head featured three cascadable channels, a \"Dimension V\" oil can delay effect, reverb, vibrato, and a fuzz. The powered cabinets could switch between normal and \"tube-emulated\" operation.\n\nZodiac-series amplifiers consisted of 'Capricorn', 'Scorpio', 'Taurus' and 'Libra' models. Aside from being covered with fake alligator skin, they were cosmetically very similar to Super Showman. However, these were smaller combo amplifiers with fewer features and aimed for the lower end of the market.\n\nFender's early transistor amplifiers had an extensive marketing campaign but in the end they proved to be a major disaster. Many key executives of Fender had resigned after the CBS purchase and quality control of the PCB-constructed amps was rather sloppy during the times. Reputedly many of the early solid-state amplifiers failed simply because employees didn't bother to clean up the soldering machines or attach the semiconductors properly to their heat sinks. The infancy of semiconductor technology also meant that many designs failed due to thermal runaway caused by insufficient cooling or lack of knowledge concerning \"safe\" power ratings of transistors. The cascaded effects from all this created a very poor reputation for the transistor products and the entire solid-state line was discontinued already in 1971. Additionally the experience also scared Fender away from solid-state amplifier technology for the next ten years.\n\nOne well known player who took to the Fender Solid State amps was Jan Akkerman who used Super Showman full stacks during the early years of Focus, favouring their clear sound. He used them well into the seventies, often in conjunction with Marshalls to add low end.\n\nThe Silverface amplifiers were succeeded by a new breed of Fender designs. Fender was now competing with manufacturers who were more in tune with the market; specifically, many guitar players were interested less in \"cleanish\" country amp and instead wanted more versatile tone controls and, perhaps more importantly, greater amounts of distortion. This market was dominated by companies such as Marshall and later Mesa Boogie—both of which had gotten started modifying Fender amps (the Bassman and the Princeton, respectively).\n\nCertain elements of the Blackface cosmetics were reintroduced in the mid-1970s on a series of amplifiers designed by Ed Jahns. The first amplifiers in this new line included the infamous 180W 'Super Twin' and 'Super Twin Reverb' amplifiers which featured active tone controls and a built-in distortion circuit that blended between clean and distorted sounds. Some bass amplifiers with similar architecture were also released, namely the 'Studio Bass' and 'PS300'.\n\nThese amplifiers didn't yet render obsolete the Silverface series and manufacturing of both co-existed for years. In fact, many Silverface designs were revised to the ultra-linear architecture to step up their output power from 100 watts to 135 watts. Also, existing Silverface Princeton Reverb and Deluxe Reverb circuits were offered in a slightly modified Blackface cosmetic package from roughly 1978 to 1982, the difference from the 1960s versions being that the model designation on the faceplate did not include the word \"Amp\" after the script typeface model name, as the earlier versions had.\n\nThe new Blackfaces came in varying cosmetic styles. All of them had a black control panel and traditional knobs, but they no longer featured the Blackface-style lettering to depict the model name and the traditional control panel layout was partially redesigned. Some of these amplifiers had a silver grillcloth typical to previous BF and SF series amps, but more often the amplifiers sported a black grillcloth. Some amplifiers also had an aluminum trimming running around the grille. The styling didn't become consistent until the early 1980s, at which point all these designs were already discontinued to make way for the very similar looking \"II Series\".\n\nIn the late 1970s and very early 1980s the \"Supers\" were followed by the tube-based '30', '75 (Lead)', and '140' tube amps (with reverb and overdrive features) and two solid-state 'Harvard' amps (one with reverb), which were 15W practice amplifiers. Design-wise the tube amplifiers were quite different from their predecessors, as the active tone controls and blending distortion circuit had been removed and the latter feature replaced by a crude version of the channel switching concept. A new feature addition was a crude insert-style effects loop.\n\nThe II Series amplifiers were produced from 1982 until 1986, being the last Fender amps to be made at Fullerton. The specifications for these amplifiers (all 14 of which are listed here), and leadership of the design team, came from Paul Rivera (then marketing director) and are known as Fender Rivera era amplifiers. Some amplifiers in the series used the II moniker; the Champ II, Princeton Reverb II, Deluxe Reverb II and Twin Reverb II, while others such as the Concert and Super Champ did not. Many of these amps had the normal Fender clean sound and in addition a switchable mid voiced gain channel, designed to compete with the Mesa Boogie Mark Series series amps that had gained popularity at the time. The tube amps in the series feature hand-wired eyelet board construction and are also becoming sought-after collectors items, due to the design and build quality. The range included one small tube-driven bass amp, the Bassman 20. There were also some solid-state amplifiers using the II moniker, such as the Harvard Reverb II. Other solid-state amps produced during the Rivera era included the Yale Reverb, Studio Lead, Stage Lead, London Reverb, Montreux, and a solid-state issue of the Showman. Many of these units shared the same circuitry boards in one capacity or another.\n\nThe Red Knob amplifiers were produced from 1987 until 1993. They were made in Lake Oswego, Oregon, at the Sunn factory, a brand/company that Fender had purchased in 1985–86.\n\nThese were some of the first models produced by the newly formed Fender Musical Instrument Corporation. Aside from the bright red controls, these amplifiers have a slightly similar appearance to the older Blackface cosmetics, bearing black control panels with white lettering and the late 1970s \"scripted tailless\" Fender logo. Many of these models were simply refitted with black knobs and early 1970s \"unscripted tailless\" Fender logos in 1996 when most Fender amplifier manufacturing moved to the Ensenada factory in Mexico. This series of amplifiers all used printed circuit board construction. \n\nTwo utilized the same circuit board and wattage, the Fender Eighty-Five and the Studio 10. They contain the same 65 WRMS circuit, but contain a 12\" speaker and a 10\" speaker, respectively. The Fender Eighty-Five was used by Steve Miller (Steve Miller Band) and Jonny Greenwood (Radiohead) on many recordings.\n\nIn the first fifth of the 21st Century, Fender turned to digital technology to expand its lineup of amplifiers. The first of these, the Cyber Twin and Cyber Deluxe, used circuits within the computer chips to replicate famous amps and effects. The preamp is tube-driven, and the power amp is solid state. \n\nNext came the G-DEC (Guitar Digital Entertainment Center), a true modeling amp. It was released in 2007 along with a PC software package to allow it to emulate a wide array of pedals, stompboxes, and amplifiers. The G-Dec won high praise at the time but its effects, based on three-decade-old MIDI technology, were rapidly outdated. An updated G-DEC 3 was released in 2010, followed by the Mustang in 2012. \n\n2014 saw the traditionally-styled Champion amplifier (not to be confused with the classic and reissue Champion/Champ tube amplifiers) released. This amp eschewed the Fuse software in favor of an on-board system, selected by knobs. \n\n2015 saw the release of the Mustang v.2 amplifiers, along with a refresh of the Fuse PC app. \nIn 2017, the Mustang GT series was launched, with Bluetooth capability and wi-fi for over-the-air software updates, with a modernized look and smartphone-enabled functionality through the new Fender Tone app. \n\nAt the same time, Fender re-released a number of classic amplifiers such as the Bassman and Bandmaster, to high praise both from the music press and the public.\n"}

Working as a KGB agent, he defected to the West in 1963.\n\nBorn in Kutaisi, Georgia, Krotkov received his BA in literature from the University of Moscow. He worked for TASS and Radio Moscow. After World War II, he was an information officer in Berlin, Germany as a KGB agent. By 1956, he was a screenwriter in Moscow and still a KGB agent. He was selected as one of the principal agents in the seduction/compromise operation against Maurice Dejean, the French ambassador to the USSR, and his wife. Krotkov was tasked with seducing the wife while various women agents seduced the husband.\n\nOn 13 September 1963, feeling guilty for the suicide of French military attaché Louis Guibaud, which was driven by a similar seduction/compromise operation, he defected in London, England. In 1964, he vouched for Yuri Nosenko. His information led to the exposure of John Watkins. In 1969, he moved to the United States and became a novelist. He wrote \"I Am From Moscow\" (1967), \"The Red Monarch: Scenes From the Life of Stalin\" (1979), and \"The Nobel Prize\" (1980).\n\nIn November 1969, Krotkov testified before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security that Wilfred Burchett had been his agent when he worked as a KGB controller. However, he also named, very implausibly, Jean-Paul Sartre and John Kenneth Galbraith as KGB agents, casting a great deal of doubt on his testimony. He claimed that Burchett had proposed a \"special relationship\" with the Soviets at their first meeting in Berlin in 1947. Krotkov also reported that Burchett had worked as an agent for both Vietnam and China and was a secret member of the Communist Party of Australia. For his part, Burchett critic Tibor Méray alleged that he was an undercover party member but not a KGB agent.\n\nThe returning dissident Vladimir Bukovsky was able to gain access to formerly secret documents in Moscow in 1992, and was able to copy them, including those concerning Burchett. According to communist propaganda expert Herbert Romerstein, these documents reveal that in July 1957 the KGB advised the Central Committee of the Communist Party that their agent Burchett had become Moscow correspondent of pro-communist newspaper \"National Guardian\". As the newspaper could not afford to pay him a salary, KGB requested an immediate payment of 20,000 rubles and a monthly subsidy of 3000 rubles. Burchett resigned from \"National Guardian\" in 1979 when the newspaper took the side of Chinese and Cambodian communists against the Soviet and Vietnamese communists. Robert Manne gave a similar account in 2013. Manne writes: \"Every detail in the KGB memorandum is consistent with the Washington testimony of Yuri Krotkov. It now turns out that he was not a liar and a perjurer, but a truth-teller.\" KGB archives indicate that in 1957 Burchett was receiving monetary compensation for his services as a journalist, but do not contain evidence of espionage or acting as an agent for the Soviet state.\n\n\n"}

It is the second and final novel that she published. The first chapter was originally published as the story \"You Can't Be Any Poorer Than Dead\" in the journal \"New World Writing\". The novel tells the story of Francis Marion Tarwater, a fourteen-year-old boy who is trying to escape the destiny his uncle has prescribed for him: the life of a prophet. Like most of O'Connor's stories, the novel is filled with Catholic themes and dark images, making it a classic example of Southern Gothic literature.\n\nMason Tarwater, an outspoken evangelist and self-ordained prophet, dies many years after kidnapping his great-nephew Francis and raising in a backwoods cabin, preparing him instead to someday take his place as a prophet. Prior to his death, Mason asked the now-teenaged Francis to give him a proper Christian burial with a cross marking the grave so that his body would be resurrected on Judgment Day. Francis starts to dig the grave but suddenly hears a \"Voice\" in his head telling him to forget about the old man. Francis obeys and gets drunk instead. When Francis wakes from his drunken sleep, he sets the cabin on fire with his great-uncle's body still inside. He leaves for the city and gets a ride from a salesman, who drops him off at his Uncle Rayber's house.\n\nRayber, a well-educated schoolteacher, is amazed to see young Francis, whom he had long ago given up on after his \"kidnapping\" by Mason. Francis is also greeted at the door by Rayber's young son Bishop, who (it is implied) has Down syndrome and low intelligence. Bishop is Rayber's child with Bernice Bishop, a meddlesome social worker whom Mason had referred to as \"the welfare woman\". The old man had previously told Francis that Bernice was much older than Rayber and only able to give him one disabled child, and that God had mercy on the child by making him \"dim-witted\", which was the only way to protect him from his evil parents. Mason had commissioned Francis to baptize Bishop at some point, in order to save the little boy's soul. Due to this history, Francis is immediately put on edge when confronted with Bishop, but decides to stay with his uncle anyway. Francis does not think of Bishop as a human being and finds him repulsive.\n\nThe three begin to live together as a family for a while, and Rayber is excited to have his nephew back in order to raise him as a normal boy and provide him with a proper education. However, Francis resists his uncle's attempts at secular reform very much the same way he resisted Mason's attempts at religious reform. Rayber understands what Francis is going through, as he himself had been kidnapped as a child by Mason, but Rayber's father had managed to rescued him.\n\nAfter many attempts by Rayber to \"civilize\" the reluctant Tarwater, and many attempts by Tarwater to figure out his true destiny (either as a prophet, which was his great-uncle's wish, or as an enlightened, educated modern man, which is his uncle Rayber's wish), Rayber devises a plan to take Tarwater back to the farm where Tarwater had been raised in the hope that confronting his past will allow him to leave it behind. Under the guise of taking the two boys out to a country lodge to go fishing, Rayber finally confronts Tarwater, telling him that he must accept an ordinary life and ignore the superstitious Christian upbringing and the false destiny with which his great-uncle has corrupted him. Tarwater, however, is not so easily convinced. While at the lodge, he again hears the \"Voice\" (the devil) who tells Tarwater to forsake his great-uncle's command to baptize Bishop and to drown the boy instead. One evening, Tarwater takes Bishop out on a boat to the middle of the lake, with Rayber's reluctant blessing. Rayber cannot see them on the lake but can still hear their voices. Tarwater ends up drowning Bishop while at the same time baptizing the boy, thereby fulfilling both destinies simultaneously. Rayber realizes what has happened and faints, not out of fear for his son's life, but because he feels nothing at his son's death.\n\nTarwater runs away into the woods and tries to make his way back to his great-uncle's house to confront his demons once and for all. He eventually hitches a ride with another man, who entices Tarwater to get drunk. Tarwater takes the man's offer and passes out, eventually waking up naked against a tree with his clothes neatly folded beside him. He dresses hurriedly and sets fire to the area.\n\nBurning his way through the forest, Tarwater finally makes his way back to Powderhead, his great-uncle's old farm, where he finds the cabin has burned to the ground. Tarwater had assumed that his great-uncle had been burned up with it, but Buford, a black man who lived nearby, had actually rescued old Mason Tarwater's body from the house while Tarwater was drunk at the beginning of the novel, and gave the old man a proper Christian burial just as he had requested. Tarwater realizes that his great-uncle's two main requests (that he be given a proper burial and that Tarwater's nephew Bishop be baptized) have been realized, which convinces Tarwater that he can no longer run away from his calling to be a prophet. The story ends with Tarwater heading toward the city to fulfill his calling to \"Go warn the children of God of the terrible speed of mercy.\"\n\nThe novel's title is taken from a verse of the Douay Bible: \n\nThere are various explanations of the meaning of this verse. The most accepted explanation is that violence constantly attacks God and heaven and that only those who are \"violent with the love of God\" can bear heaven away. This is seen when Tarwater drowns Bishop. He commits a violent act, but the \"accidental\" baptism is a powerful act of violent love for God—which bears away the crime of murder.\n\nAnother possible meaning is that both secularism and fundamentalism (that is, the Protestant functioning outside of the Roman Catholic Church) are heresy, which blinds their adherents to God's truth. When God's grace comes into contact with an errant life, a violent revelation occurs. Falsehood and heresy are burnt off, and the sinner then sees the truth clearly. Those who suffer this spiritual violence bear the kingdom of God with them as they go through the world.\n\n\nFlannery O'Connor was a devout Catholic, and \"The Violent Bear It Away\" reflects her religious beliefs. It is filled with religious imagery and themes, ranging from the power of passion to the dominance of destiny.\n\nThe most obvious of the novel's themes is the idea that destiny and religion will dominate over the secular. O'Connor illustrates this well, demonstrating the power of Tarwater's destiny as it dominates every obstacle in its way; the drowning of Bishop is transformed to a baptism, Tarwater's rape turns to revelation, and the secular Rayber fails in every way. The importance of passion is also linked with the power of religion. Tarwater is filled with passion; Rayber suppresses his. Thus, Tarwater succeeds and is redeemed, and Rayber is ultimately destroyed. This is shown when Bishop is killed; when he realizes that he has no love for his son, Rayber collapses.\n\nThe idea that everything that destroys also creates is evident as well. Nearly every symbol and character in the book pulls Tarwater away from his destiny but also pushes him back. Rayber nearly succeeds in secularizing Tarwater, but he ultimately brings the boy back to Powderhead. The drowning of Bishop, the ultimate secular act, nearly destroys Tarwater's destiny, but the simultaneous baptism redeems it. Fire both destroys Powderhead and burns Tarwater's eyes clean. Water both drowns and baptizes. Everything that destroys, redeems.\n\nJames Cantrell feels that O'Connor's Irish heritage is central to the novel, serving as the foundation of her exploration of the conflicts between Christ and secularism in America. He says, for example, the surname \"Tarwater\" is completely understood only by focusing on Irish culture and history.\n\nOne possible reading of the novel offers cautionary tale about religious anti-intellectualism. Old Mason Tarwater epitomizes faith coupled with anti-intellectualism and spiritual pride, which brings about the whole series of unfortunate events depicted in the book. Rayber is a basically moral person, but abashed by the closed-minded and anti-intellectual approach to religion that was infused in is childhood draws him towards atheism. Had he actually employed his efforts to find rational reasons for Christian faith, he would find no lack of evidential support, as Christianity has a rich intellectual tradition. Thus Rayber would probably have become a true Christian, himself baptising Bishop, perhaps coming to terms with his fanatical uncle, and educating his nephew both in science and in faith, which are complementary.\n"}

At the 2016 census, the locality of Eromanga had a population of 119. However, the town of Eromanga has a population averaging from 30-40.\n\nThe town lies on the edge of what is called the Eromanga Inland Sea, which existed in the Early Cretaceous. The Eromanga region has abundant oil wells and opal mines. There are also agricultural industries such as cattle and sheep as many pioneering property owners came and took up land in the 1860s. Dinosaur fossils, including Australia's largest dinosaur a titanosaur species of sauropod, have also been found here making it an area of interest for palaeontologists. It is located on what was Ngandangara territory.\n\nEromanga has been touted as the town in Australia located the farthest from any ocean. However, this claim does not stand up to scrutiny. See Pole of inaccessibility for approximations of other locations in Australia that could also make such claims.\n\nThe name of the town Eromanga goes back as far as about 1860. The name is thought to have come from an Aboriginal word that means \"hot gale plain\" or \"windy plain\", though the language and dialect is unknown. But Erromango/Erromanga is also the name of an island in the New Hebrides.\n\nEromanga Post Office opened by October 1902 (a receiving office had been open from 1892).\n\nEromanga Provisional School opened on 5 July 1897 but closed in 1908. In 1910 it reopened as Eromanga State School but closed again on 28 February 1911. The school reopened on 23 October 1917 but closed again. It reopened in 1919 until it closed on 22 March 1936. It reopened on 28 May 1956 and closed again on 11 December 1981. It reopened 29 January 1990.\n\nOne property which is located in Eromanga which was first written up in 1928 by Keith Pegler, Monler Station, is now in its third generation of farmers. The property, located 11 km south of the town centre, was originally run as a sheep and cattle farm by Keith and has since been passed to Ross Pegler before the current Scott Pegler who runs the station with his family. The property has struggled over the years with natural disasters ranging from drought to flooding, however, the area has received very little rain in its recent history as it has been in it longest drought in history.\n\nEromanga State School is a government primary (P-7) school located in Donald Street (). Between 2010 and 2013, the school had between 5 and 6 students enrolled; all students have an individual learning plan. There is one permanent teacher, a teacher aide (partly funded by the community) plus visiting teachers from other schools.\n\nThe Eromanga branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association has its rooms on the corner of Deacon and Donald Streets.\n\nDue to its name, the town was referenced in the second episode of Ichigo Mashimaro, the first episode of Volume 2 in the anime Ninja Nonsense, in episode 18 of Samurai Flamenco, and again in the light novel/anime Eromanga Sensei for its similarity to the term ero manga (literally meaning erotic manga).\n"}

{"id": "1922976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922976", "title": "War (The Temptations song)", "text": "War (The Temptations song)\n\n\"War\" is a counterculture era soul song written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong for the Motown label in 1969. Whitfield first produced the song – an obvious anti-Vietnam War statement – with The Temptations as the original vocalists. After Motown began receiving repeated requests to release \"War\" as a single, Whitfield re-recorded the song with Edwin Starr as the vocalist, with the label deciding to withhold the Temptations' version from single release so as not to alienate their more conservative fans. Starr's version of \"War\" was a No. 1 hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in 1970, and is not only the most successful and well-known record of his career, but it is also one of the most popular protest songs ever recorded. It was one of 161 songs on the no-play list issued by Clear Channel following the events of September 11, 2001.\n\nThe Temptations' version of \"War\", featuring Paul Williams and Dennis Edwards on lead vocals, was less intense than the Edwin Starr version. Williams and Edwards deliver the song's anti-war, pro-peace message over a stripped-down instrumental track, with bass singer Melvin Franklin chanting a repeated recruit training-like \"hup, two, three, four\" in the background during the verses.\n\nThe song was included as a track on the March 1970 \"Psychedelic Shack\" album, which featured the title track as its only single. The track's direct message, summarized by its chorus (\"War, what is it good for? Absolutely nothin'!\"), struck a chord with the American public and resonated with growing public opposition to the war in Vietnam. Fans from across the country, many of them college students and other young people, sent letters to Motown requesting the release of \"War\" as a single. The label did not want to risk the image of its most popular male group, and the Temptations themselves were also apprehensive about releasing such a potentially controversial song as a single. The label decided to withhold \"War\"'s release as a single, a decision that Whitfield fought until the label came up with a compromise: \"War\" would be released, but it would have to be re-recorded with a different act.\n\nEdwin Starr, who had become a Motown artist in 1968 after his former label, Ric-Tic, was purchased by Motown founder Berry Gordy, Jr., became \"War's\" new vocalist. Considered among Motown's \"second-string\" acts, Starr had only one major hit, 1968's No. 6 hit \"Twenty-Five Miles\", to his name by this time. He heard about the conflict surrounding the debate of whether or not to release \"War\", and volunteered to re-record it. Whitfield re-created the song to match Starr's James Brown-influenced soul shout: the single version of \"War\" was dramatic and intense, depicting the general anger and distaste the anti-war movement felt towards the war in Vietnam. Unlike the Temptations' original, Starr's \"War\" was a full-scale Whitfield production, with prominent electric guitar lines, clavinets, a heavily syncopated rhythm accented by a horn section, and with The Originals and Whitfield's new act The Undisputed Truth on backing vocals.\n\nUpon its release in June 1970, Starr's \"War\" became a runaway hit, and held the No. 1 position on the \"Billboard\" Pop Singles chart for three weeks, in August and September 1970. It replaced \"Make It With You\" by Bread, and was itself taken out of the spot by another Motown single, \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" by Diana Ross. \"Billboard\" ranked it as the No. 5 song of 1970.\n\nNotable as the most successful protest song to become a pop hit, earning compliments from contemporary protester John Lennon, \"War\" became Edwin Starr's signature song. Rather than hindering his career (as it might have done for the Temptations), \"War\" buoyed Starr's career, and he adopted the image of an outspoken liberal orator for many of his other early-1970s releases, including the similarly themed \"Stop the War Now\" from 1971. It and another 1971 single, \"Funky Music Sho' 'Nuff Turns Me On\", continued Starr's string of Whitfield-produced psychedelic soul hits. After 1971, Starr's career began to falter, and, citing Motown's reliance on formulas, he departed the label in the mid-1970s.\n\nLater in his career, after moving to the United Kingdom, Starr re-recorded several of his hits with British band Utah Saints. Starr's new version of \"War\" in 2003 was his final piece. He died on April 2 of the same year of a heart attack.\n\nStarr earned a Grammy nomination in 1971 for \"War\" for best R&B Male Vocal. In 1999, Starr's recording of the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nStarr's version of the song was used as the basis for a cover version by Ugly Rumours, a group formed by Tony Blair while at university. The song was released by the Stop the War Coalition and credited to Ugly Rumours, with the band being fronted by a lookalike of Blair. It peaked at number 21 on the UK Singles Chart in March 2007.\n\nThe song's power was reasserted when Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band took their rendition into the U.S. Top 10 in 1986. It was also covered by Frankie Goes to Hollywood in 1984 and more recently by the rock band Black Stone Cherry on its 2016 album \"Kentucky\".\n\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood followed their debut 1983 UK number one single Relax with Two Tribes. The principal B-side for 12-inch single was a cover version of \"War\". To build on the chart success of \"Two Tribes\", \"War\" became the subject of an accomplished extended remix in its own right (subtitled \"Hidden\") for the third version of single's UK 12-inch. For the release \"War\" was promoted as a double-A-side with the \"Carnage\" mix of \"Two Tribes\" on the reverse. The 12-inch double-A-side single was released in standard and picture disc versions, both with the ZTT Records catalog number WARTZ 3.\n\nVersions of both \"Two Tribes\" and \"War\" would later appear on the group's 1984 debut album \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" as well as numerous Frankie Goes to Hollywood and ZTT Records compilation albums.\n\nThe release of \"War\" / \"Two Tribes\" also coincided with an extensive and iconic T-shirt marketing campaign for the band during the summer of 1984, featuring such slogans as \"Frankie Say WAR! Hide Yourself\", as pictured on the 12\" single cover.\n\nSeveral lines of spoken dialogue were added to the Temptations/Edwin Starr version of the song. Impressionist Chris Barrie voiced the long soliloquy about war and love, while impersonating the American President Ronald Reagan; a role he would later reprise in the hit UK TV Show Spitting Image. Born in Germany, Barrie translated and subversively quoted Adolf Hitler from his failed 1924 putsch trial, in the first new lines added to the song.\n\n\"War\" was performed in concert by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band in 1985, added to the set list for the final few shows of their lengthy Born in the U.S.A. Tour. Springsteen and his manager Jon Landau were looking for a way to make these concluding shows, taking place at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, a little different and special, and Landau suggested playing \"War\". A year earlier, he had suggested the same, as a loose protest against Reagan Administration foreign policy in Central America and elsewhere, but the band had been unable to come up with an effective arrangement. This time, however, they did. Springsteen taped the words of the song to his arm, prefaced the song with a spoken admonition not to blindly trust the government, leaders or anything else, and then he and the band performed a rock rendition.\n\nSpringsteen released the September 30, 1985 performance as a part of his 1986 box set, \"Live/1975–85\". \"War\" was chosen as the first single from the set, and it was again a big hit, reaching No. 8 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. The music video for the single was a straight concert filming of the same performance.\n\nSpringsteen continued to perform \"War\" regularly through his 1988 Tunnel of Love Express and Human Rights Now! Tours. He then retired it for 11 years until a one-off guest spot by Edwin Starr during the Reunion Tour. Springsteen brought the song back for six performances on his 2003 Rising Tour before and in the early days of the Iraq War. Springsteen has, to date, performed the song since 2003.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1922978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922978", "title": "Meat industry", "text": "Meat industry\n\nThe term meat industry describes modern industrialized livestock agriculture for production, packing, preservation marketing of meat (in contrast to dairy products, wool, etc.). In economics, it is a fusion of primary (agriculture) and secondary (industry) activity and hard to characterize strictly in terms of either one alone. The greater part of the entire meat industry is termed meat packing industry- the segment that handles the slaughtering, processing, packaging, and distribution of animals such as cattle, pigs, sheep and other livestock.\n\nA great portion of the ever-growing meat branch in the food industry involves intensive animal farming in which livestock are kept almost entirely indoors or in restricted outdoor settings like pens.\n\nMany aspects of the raising of animals for meat have become industrialized, even many practices more associated with smaller family farms, e.g. gourmet foods such as foie gras.\n\nThe production of livestock is a heavily vertically integrated industry where the majority of supply chain stages are integrated and owned by one company.\n\nThe livestock industry not only uses more land than any other human activity; it's also one of the largest contributors to water pollution and a huge source of greenhouse gas emissions. In this respect, a relevant factor is the produced species' feed conversion efficiency. Additionally taking into account other factors like use of energy, pesticides, land, and nonrenewable resources, beef, lamb, goat, and bison as resources of red meat show the worst efficiency; poultry and eggs come out best. \n\nAmong the largest meat producers worldwide are:\n\nCritical aspects of the effects of industrial meat production include\n\nMany observers suggest that the expense of dealing with the above is grossly underestimated at present economic metrics and that true/full cost accounting would drastically raise the price of industrial meat.\n\nAmerican slaughterhouse workers are three times more likely to suffer serious injury than the average American worker. NPR reports that pig and cattle slaughterhouse workers are nearly seven times more likely to suffer repetitive strain injuries than average. The Guardian reports that on average there are two amputations a week involving slaughterhouse workers in the United States. On average, one employee of Tyson Foods, the largest meat producer in America, is injured and amputates a finger or limb per month. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported that over a period of six years, in the UK 78 slaughter workers lost fingers, parts of fingers or limbs, more than 800 workers had serious injuries, and at least 4,500 had to take more than three days off after accidents. In a 2018 study in the Italian Journal of Food Safety, slaughterhouse workers are instructed to wear ear protectors to protect their hearing from the constant screams of animals being killed. A 2004 study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine found that \"excess risks were observed for mortality from all causes, all cancers, and lung cancer\" in workers employed in the New Zealand meat processing industry.\n\nThe act of slaughtering animals, or of raising or transporting animals for slaughter, may engender psychological stress or trauma in the people involved. A 2016 study in \"Organization\" indicates, \"Regression analyses of data from 10,605 Danish workers across 44 occupations suggest that slaughterhouse workers consistently experience lower physical and psychological well-being along with increased incidences of negative coping behavior.\" In her thesis submitted to and approved by University of Colorado, Anna Dorovskikh states that slaughterhouse workers are \"at risk of Perpetration-Inducted Traumatic Stress, which is a form of posttraumatic stress disorder and results from situations where the concerning subject suffering from PTSD was a causal participant in creating the traumatic situation.\" A 2009 study by criminologist Amy Fitzgerald indicates, \"slaughterhouse employment increases total arrest rates, arrests for violent crimes, arrests for rape, and arrests for other sex offenses in comparison with other industries.\" As authors from the PTSD Journal explain, \"These employees are hired to kill animals, such as pigs and cows that are largely gentle creatures. Carrying out this action requires workers to disconnect from what they are doing and from the creature standing before them. This emotional dissonance can lead to consequences such as domestic violence, social withdrawal, anxiety, drug and alcohol abuse, and PTSD.\"\n\nSlaughterhouses in the United States commonly illegally employ and exploit underage workers and illegal immigrants. In 2010, Human Rights Watch described slaughterhouse line work in the United States as a human rights crime. In a report by Oxfam America, slaughterhouse workers were observed not being allowed breaks, were often required to wear diapers, and were paid below minimum wage.\n\nCultured meat (aka \"clean meat\") potentially offers some advantages in terms of efficiency of resource use and animal welfare. It is, however, still at an early stage of development and its advantages are still contested.\n\nIncreasing health care costs for an aging baby boom population suffering from obesity and other food-related diseases, concerns about obesity in children have spurred new ideas about healthy nutrition with less emphasis on meat.\n\nNative wild species like deer and bison in North America would be cheaper and potentially have less impact on the environment. The combination of more wild game meat options and higher costs for natural capital affected by the meat industry could be a building block towards a more sustainable livestock agriculture.\n\nA growing trend towards vegetarian or vegan diets and the Slow Food movement are indicators of a changing consumer conscience in western countries. Producers on the other hand have reacted to consumer concerns by slowly shifting towards ecological or organic farming. The Alternative meat industry is projected to be worth 140 billion in the next 10 years.\n\n"}
{"id": "1922997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922997", "title": "History of Lego", "text": "History of Lego\n\nThe History of Lego began in 1932 in a Danish carpentry workshop and continues into the 21st century as a popular and very profitable line of construction toys and related products and services, including Lego board games, retail stores, Lego video games, Lego films, Legoland theme parks, and Lego Serious Play consultant services, with a significant impact on various areas of popular culture. Despite its expansion, the company remains privately held.\n\nThe Lego Group began in the carpentry workshop of Ole Kirk Christiansen in Billund, Denmark. In 1916, Christiansen purchased a woodworking shop in Billund, which had been in business since 1895. The shop mostly helped construct houses and furniture and had a small staff of apprentices. The workshop burned down in 1924 when a fire ignited some wood shavings. Ole Kirk constructed a larger workshop and worked towards expanding his business even further. When the Great Depression hit, Ole Kirk had fewer customers and had to focus on smaller projects. He began producing miniature versions of his products as design aids. It was these miniature models of stepladders and ironing boards that inspired him to begin producing toys. \n\nOn the 10th of August 1932, Ole Kirk's shop started making wooden toys such as piggy banks, pull toys, cars and trucks, and houses. The business was not profitable because of the Great Depression. Farmers in the area sometimes traded food in exchange for his toys; Ole Kirk continued producing practical furniture in addition to toys to stay in business. In the mid-1930s, the yo-yo toy fad gave him a brief period of increased activity until it suddenly collapsed. To reduce waste, Ole Kirk used the leftover yo-yo parts as wheels for toy trucks. His son Godtfred began working for him, taking an active role in the company.\n\nIn 1934, Ole Kirk held a contest among his staff to name the company, offering a bottle of homemade wine as a prize. Christiansen was considering two names himself, \"Legio\" (with the implication of a \"Legion of toys\") and \"Lego,\" a self-made contraction from the Danish phrase \"leg godt\", meaning \"play well.\" Later the Lego Group discovered that \"Lego\" could be loosely interpreted as \"I put together\" or \"I assemble\" in Latin. Ole Kirk selected \"Lego\", and the company began using it on their products.\n\nFollowing World War II, plastics became available in Denmark, and Lego purchased a plastic injection molding machine in 1947. One of the first modular toys to be produced was a truck that could be taken apart and re-assembled. In 1947, Ole Kirk and Godtfred obtained samples of interlocking plastic bricks produced by the company Kiddicraft. Hilary Fisher Page designed these \"Kiddicraft Self-Locking Building Bricks.\" In 1939, Page had applied for a patent on hollow plastic cubes with four studs on top (British Patent Nº.529,580) that allowed their positioning atop one another without lateral movement. In 1944, Page applied an \"Improvement to Toy Building Blocks\" as an addition to the previous patent, in which he describes a building system based on rectangular hollow blocks with 2X4 studs on top enabling the construction of walls with staggered rows and window openings. The addition was granted in 1947 as British Patent Nº 587,206. In 1949, the Lego Group began producing similar bricks, calling them \"Automatic Binding Bricks.\" Lego bricks, then manufactured from cellulose acetate, were developed in the spirit of traditional wooden blocks that could be stacked upon one another but could be \"locked\" together. They had several round \"studs\" on top, and a hollow rectangular bottom. They would stick together, but not so tightly that they could not be pulled apart. In 1953, the bricks were given a new name: \"Lego Mursten\", or \"Lego Bricks.\"\n\nPlastic products initially were not well received by customers, who preferred wooden or metal toys. Many of Lego's shipments were returned, following poor sales. In 1954, Godtfred had become the junior managing director of the Lego Group. Godtfred's conversation with an overseas buyer struck the idea of a toy \"system,\" with many toys in a line of related products. Godtfred evaluated their available products, and saw the plastic bricks as the best candidate for such a \"system.\" In 1955, Lego released the \"Town Plan\" as such a system, using the building bricks.\n\nThe building bricks were moderately received but had some problems from a technical standpoint: their \"locking\" ability was limited, and they were not versatile. In 1958 the bricks were improved with hollow tubes in the underside of the brick. This change added support in the base, enabling much better locking ability and enhanced versatility. The company patented the new design, as well as several similar designs to avoid competition. Ole Kirk Christiansen died that same year, and Godtfred inherited the leadership of the company.\n\nAnother warehouse fire struck the Lego Group in 1960, consuming most of the company's inventory of wooden toys. Godtfred decided that the plastic line was strong enough to abandon the production of wooden toys. As a result, Godtfred's brothers Gerhardt (then head of wooden toys) and Karl Georg left the Lego company and began a separate company, \"Bilofix.\" By the end of the year, the Lego Group was employing more than 450 people.\n\nIn 1961, Lego wished to expand sales to North America but did not have the logistical capabilities to do so. Lego made an arrangement allowing Samsonite to begin producing and selling Lego products in the United States and Canada.\n\n1961 and 1962 saw the introduction of the first Lego wheels, an addition that expanded the potential for building cars, trucks, buses, and other vehicles from Lego bricks. Also, during this time, the Lego Group introduced toys targeted explicitly towards the pre-school market.\n\nIn 1964, cellulose acetate, the material used to create Lego bricks, was replaced by the more stable acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS plastic), which is still in use today. ABS is non-toxic, is less prone to discolouration and warping, and is more resistant to heat, acids, salt, and other chemicals. Samsonite manufacturing in North America did not switch at the same time, and still used some degree of cellulose acetate in its Lego products. 1964 was the first year that saw the inclusion of instruction manuals in Lego sets.\n\nOne of the Lego Group's most successful series, the Lego train system, was released in 1966. The original train sets included a 4.5-volt (which was changed to a 12-volt version two years later) motor, battery box, and rails.\n\nOn 7 June 1968, the first Legoland Park was opened in Billund. This theme park featured elaborate models of miniature towns built entirely from Lego bricks. The three-acre (12,000 m²) park attracted 625,000 visitors in its first year alone. During the next 20 years, the theme park grew to more than eight times its original size and eventually averaged close to a million paying visitors per year. Sales of Lego sets reached more than eighteen million units in 1968.\n\nIn 1969, the Duplo system went on sale. Duplo bricks are much larger than Lego bricks, making them safer for young children, but the two systems are compatible: Lego bricks can be fitted neatly onto Duplo bricks, allowing a seamless transition to the Lego system as children outgrow their Duplo bricks. The name Duplo comes from the Latin word \"duplus\", which translates literally as double, meaning that a Duplo brick is exactly twice the dimension of a Lego building brick (2× height by 2× width by 2× depth = 8× the volume of a brick).\n\nDuring the last three decades of the 20th century, Lego expanded into new areas of toy making and marketing. In 1971, Lego began to target girls by introducing furniture pieces and dollhouses. In 1972, Lego added boat and ship sets, with floating hull pieces.\n\nDuring this same period, Godtfred Kirk Christiansen's son, Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, joined the managerial staff, after earning business degrees in Switzerland and Denmark. One of Kjeld's first achievements with the company was the foundation of manufacturing facilities, as well as a research and development department that would be responsible for keeping the company's manufacturing methods up to date. Human figures with posable arms made an appearance in 1974 in \"Lego family\" sets, which went on to become the biggest sellers at the time; the next year, an early version of the \"minifigure\" miniature Lego person was introduced, but it was not posable and had no face printed on its head. The company opened its first North American Lego production facility in Enfield, Connecticut, in the United States that same year.\n\nIn 1975, \"Expert Series\" sets were introduced, geared towards older, more experienced Lego builders followed by the \"Expert Builder\" sets in 1977. The technical sets featured moving parts such as gears, differentials, cogs, levers, axles, and universal joints and permitted the construction of realistic models such as automobiles, with functional rack and pinion steering and lifelike engine movements. In 1978 the Lego \"minifigure\" was added. These small Lego people have posable arms and legs, and a smile. The figure was used in many varieties of Lego sets, allowing construction of towns populated with the smiling minifigure Lego citizens. Lego also expanded into space with the creation of Lego Space sets with astronaut minifigures, rockets, lunar rovers, and spaceships, and in the medieval territory with the Castle theme.\n\nIn 1979, Lego introduced the Scala series, featuring jewelry elements marketed towards young girls. Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen also became the president of Lego that year.\n\nSince the 1960s, educators had seen Lego bricks' productive potential as being an invaluable asset in helping children to develop creativity and problem-solving abilities. Teachers had been using Lego bricks in the classroom for a variety of reasons. In 1980, the Lego Group established the Educational Products Department (eventually renamed Lego Dacta, in 1989), to expand the educational possibilities of their toys. A packing and assembly factory opened in Switzerland, followed by another in Jutland, Denmark, that manufactured Lego tires.\n\nBetween the 1960s and '90s, Lego worked with Royal Dutch Shell in allowing Shell branding on certain items.\n\nIn 1981, the second generation of Lego trains appeared. As before, these were available in either 4.5 V (battery-powered) or 12 V (mains powered), but with a much wider variety of accessories, including working lights, remote-controlled points and signals, and decouplers.\n\nThe \"Expert Builder\" series matured in 1982, becoming the \"Technic\" series. 13 August of that year marked the Lego Group's 50th anniversary; the book \"50 Years of Play\" was published to commemorate the occasion. In the following year, the Duplo system was expanded to include sets for even younger audiences, particularly infants; new sets included baby rattles and figures with movable limbs. The year after, Lego minifigure citizens gained a realm of knights and horses, with a redesign of the Castle theme. Light & Sound sets made their appearance in 1985; these sets included a battery pack with electrical lights, buzzers, and other accessories to add another dimension of realism to Lego creations. Also that year, the Lego Group's educational division produced the Technic Computer Control, which was an educational system whereby Technic robots, trucks, and other motorized models could be controlled with a computer. Manaus, Brazil gained a Lego factory in this year, as well.\n\nIn 1984, the Technic line was expanded with the addition of pneumatic components.\n\nIn August 1988, 38 children from 17 different countries took part in the first Lego World Cup building contest, held in Billund. That same year, Lego Canada was established. The Lego line grew again in 1989 with the release of the Lego Pirates theme, which featured a variety of pirate ships, deserted islands, and treasure. The Lego Group's Educational Products Department was renamed Lego Dakta in this year; the name comes from the Greek word \"didactic,\" which roughly means \"the study of the learning process.\" MIT's Dr. Seymour Papert, from the Laboratory of Computer Learning, was named \"Lego Professor of Learning Research,\" after his ongoing work in linking the Logo programming language with Lego products.\n\nUntil 1989, Lego minifigures only came in yellow-skin color with a standard smiling face, though early prototypes had a variety of skin colors and facial expressions. That year the Lego Group expanded the array of facial expressions (adding them around the standard face of two eyes and smile), with beards and eye patches, sunglasses, lipstick, and eyelashes, mostly for the minifigures in the newly launched Lego Pirates theme, and occasionally Lego Castle, Lego City, and Lego Space. Some older collectors resented the new facial expressions, saying they looked too \"cartoon-ish\" or \"kiddy,\" and preferred the simplistic nature of the two eyes and smile. Particularly for Lego Pirates, these more complicated faces, in combination with the torso, headgear (either a helmet or hair), and accessories, allowed for the creation of specific characters and an accompanying backstory.\n\nIn 1990, Lego released a new series designed for advanced builders. Three Model Team sets, including a race car and an off-road vehicle, featured a level of detail and realism not previously seen in any Lego series. Where Technic was mechanically accurate, Model Team was visually and stylistically accurate. The Lego Group became one of the top 10 toy companies that year; it was the only toy company in Europe to be among the top 10. Also that year, Legoland Billund reached more than one million visitors for the first time in its history. The first-ever \"Lego Professor of Business Dynamics,\" Xavier Gilbert, was appointed to an endowed chair at the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland. Lego Malaysia was also established in 1990. In 1991, the Lego Group standardized its electrical components and systems; the Trains and Technic motors were made 9V to bring the systems into line with the rest of the Lego range.\n\nIn 1992, two \"Guinness\" records were set using Lego products: A castle made from 400,000 Lego bricks, and measuring 4.45 meters by 5.22 meters, was built on Swedish television, and a 545 meters long Lego railway line with three locomotives was constructed. Duplo was augmented with the addition of the Toolo line featuring a screwdriver, wrench, nuts, and bolts; the Paradisa line, targeted towards girls, brought a variety of new pastel colors into the Lego system and focused around horses and a beach theme. In 1993 a Duplo train and a parrot-shaped \"brickvac\" that could scoop Lego pieces up off the floor were released.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Lego Group brought out a series of new and specialized ranges aimed at particular demographics. The Slizers/Throwbots line preceded the Bionicle range and uses Technic pieces and specialist moldings to create a set of action figures for boys, while Belville is a more conventional line aimed at girls and featuring large posable figures like those in the \"Technic\" range. A \"Lego 4 Juniors\" group features tall medium-sized figures (\"medi-figure\") without jointed arms, and longer legs than the classic Lego minifigure. In 2003, the Lego Group introduced a completely new system, Clikits, aimed at girls and consisting of customizable plastic jewelry and accessories. In 2004, Lego added the QUATRO brick, for ages 1–3. Much like Duplo, a Quatro brick is four times the dimension of a regular Lego brick and is compatible with the Duplo brick. Also that year, they created the second line of Knights Kingdom themed product.\n\nLego's profits had declined since 1992, and in 1998 it posted its first-ever loss, at £23 million. In the same year, the company laid off 1,000 employees.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Lego Group's retired many LEGO Designers who had created the sets from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, replacing them with 30 'innovators' who graduated from the European design colleges around Europe who knew \"little specifically about toy design and less about LEGO building\". There was a resultant change in the design direction of products, as set details were sacrificed for decreased building times (with fewer pieces) and increased playability features, but this shift drew mixed reception from hardcore Lego fans used to the meticulous construction required of \"classic era\" sets of the 1980s to early 1990s. Lego Pirates, which had a strong run since its launch in 1989, foundered due to such a reinvention as the new releases in 1996 and 1997 were largely not well-received, leading to abrupt discontinuation after 1997.\n\nIn 1999, the first Lego products featuring licensed intellectual property, i.e., not designed in-house, were Lego Star Wars and Winnie the Pooh Duplo, followed in 2000 by Lego Harry Potter characters to figures from Steven Spielberg movies. Soren Holm, the head of Lego Concept Lab, said toy weapons had always been heavily debated, but that since the Lego Star Wars release, Lego has grown \"more comfortable with conflict.\" Mr. Laursen, executive North American operations suggested to make \"violence not explicit, but humoristic.\" Licensed properties did provide a short-term boast to profits during the release of blockbuster movies, however sales would taper off after public excitement died down. Furthermore the added cost of the license resulted in such sets being more expensive which alienated long-time fans, whom also bemoaned the declining quality and reduced availability of comparable sets not based on licensing. \n\nAfter 1999, many in-house characters were strongly characterised with media utilisation and non-Lego System merchandising, most notably Bionicle from 2001–2010 and then again in 2016. In 2002, Duplo was merged with Lego Baby into the new label Lego Explore.\n\nIn 2003, following the inclusion of Lando Calrissian in a Star Wars set, as well as the Basketball theme featuring the likenesses of actual players, it was decided that minifigs based on real persons and live-action franchises would have natural skin-tones.\n\nIn 2004, Lego posted a loss of £174 million, with the executive vice-president of marketing Mads Nipper later describing the company as having been \"almost bankrupt\" at this point. \nHe analysed in retrospect that \"we continued to invest as if the company were growing strongly. We failed to realise that we were on a slippery path… Children were getting less and less time to play. Some of the western markets had fewer and fewer children. So play trends changed, and we failed to change. We were not making toys that were sufficiently interesting to children. We failed to innovate enough. And we had nowhere cut deep enough to right-size the company\".\n\nIn 2004, Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen resigned as CEO and appointed Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, the first non-family CEO. The company sold the four Legoland parks to theme-park operators Merlin Entertainments, and manufacturing, 80% of which had been outsourced, was returned to Lego's control.\n\nThe company focused on its core products and reintroduced the Duplo label in late 2004. Since 2004, manufacturing had been moved to Mexico and distribution relocated from Billund to the Czech Republic. By 2007 a global workforce of 9,100 in 1998 was reduced to 4,200 due to outsourcing. In the US alone, Lego sales increased 32 percent because of Star Wars and Indiana Jones themed games, while globally 2008 sales increased 18.7 percent. Mr. Laursen, Lego executive of North American operations, said in 2009 that licenses played a more prominent role in the American market than overseas. About 60 percent of Lego's American sales were estimated to be linked to licenses, twice that of 2004. Laursen stated in 2009 that Lego was \"definitely more commercially oriented\". In 2009, both Lego Games (board games) and Lego Power Miners were introduced; despite the Great Recession profits for 2009 were £99.5 million, with Mads Nipper, Lego executive vice-president of marketing stating to be \"delivering twice the return on sales of any competitor.\"\n\nIn 2011, Lego resumed a long-term contract with Royal Dutch Shell, after using its logo on products from the 1960s through to the 1990s. Greenpeace criticized this co-branding in 2014.\n\nIn 2012, an animated short film titled \"The Lego Story\" made by Danish studio Lani Pixels for the 80th anniversary of Lego, depicted the struggles of Ole Kirk Christiansen and his son Godtfred Kirk Christiansen from 1932–1968, as they worked to make the company successful.\n\nIn 2014, Warner Bros and The Lego Group released \"The Lego Movie\", a computer-animated adventure comedy film telling the story of an ordinary Lego Minifigure prophesied to save the world. It received one of the highest recorded openings for an original animated movie, and the Los Angeles Times noted \"nearly unanimous positive reviews\" for the film.\n\nIn 2015, the Lego firm sparked controversy when it refused a bulk order to Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, who is openly critical of the Chinese Communist government. Ai had previously used Lego bricks to build portraits of world political activists. Lego said it would not sell directly to users with \"political intentions.\" An opinion piece in the Communist Party mouthpiece \"Global Times\" praised Lego for its \"good business sense\" while the decision drew condemnation online. Lego fans offered to donate Lego bricks to Ai Weiwei instead.\n\nIn 2017, Warner Bros, DC Entertainment, and The Lego Group released \"The Lego Batman Movie\" as a spinoff based on one of the lead characters of Lego's first animated movie. Lego has since released another animated film based on one of its toy lines, Ninjago, entitled \"The Lego Ninjago Movie\" in 2017.\n\nIn the first half of 2017, Lego saw its first revenue decline in 13 years, announcing plans in September 2017 to cut 1,400 jobs.\n\nIn February 2019, a sequel to \"The Lego Movie\" was produced by Warner Animation Group and released by Warner Bros., titled \"\". Many of the voice actors from the first film reprised their characters for the sequel, but it underperformed in ticket sales compared to its predecessors, making it a box office bomb.\n\nOn November 25, 2019, The Lego Group announced the acquisition of Bricklink, the world's largest Lego fan community from Nexon, for an unknown price, which is expected to finish before the end of 2019.\n\n"}

It is situated on the sheltered Horseshoe Bay, a small bay off the much larger Encounter Bay. Pullen Island lies outside the mouth of the bay. At the , Port Elliot had a population of 1,754, although this section of the coast is now built up almost all the way from Goolwa to Victor Harbor.\n\nHorseshoe Bay was proclaimed a port in 1851, and the settlement above the bay was named Port Elliot in 1852 after Charles Elliot, the Governor of Bermuda who was a friend of the then Governor of South Australia, Sir Henry Young. The location had been previously known as Freeman's Knob; the aboriginal name for the area may have been \"Witengangool\".\n\nFreemans Nob was used as a lookout post for shore-base bay whaling stations in Encounter Bay in the late 1830s. The area was also used as a place to launch boats in 1842 for Hargan and Hart’s whaling station at Rosetta Head.\n\nThe port was established to provide a safe seaport for the Murray river trade which terminated at Goolwa as the Murray Mouth was deemed too treacherous and unpredictable for safe navigation. Goods and passengers were carried between Goolwa and Port Elliot on the first public railway in Australia completed in 1854.\n\nThe government works to establish the port included Australia's first reticulated water supply, from wells at Waterport (about 1 km north of the bay) to tanks above the jetty which provided fresh water for ships as well as for the town. In 1864 after a number of disastrous shipping losses in Horseshoe Bay the railway was extended to Victor Harbor which provided safer access for ships. Port Elliot's role as a port ended, with the bay and jetty being left to the fishermen and beachgoers. The importance of the rail link between the river and the sea soon also ended with the building of a railway between Adelaide and Morgan which enabled river traffic to offload freight and passengers over further upstream and rail them directly to Adelaide. The towns of the southern Fleurieu coast – Victor Harbor, Port Elliot, Middleton and Goolwa – were spared any further commercial or industrial development, and became a popular holiday destination with many guest houses, camping parks and 'weekender' houses and shacks. The nearby early subdivisions of Waterport, Louisville, Findon, Ville St.Louis and Elliot Town are now all considered part of Port Elliot.\n\nToday, Port Elliot is a quiet township with two hotels, three churches, six coffee shops, no fast food chains, and is a popular holiday destination close enough to Adelaide for day trippers and even commuters. The continuing expansion of the Greater Adelaide metropolitan area together with ongoing improvements to the road links between the Fleurieu Peninsula and Adelaide has brought an influx of \"seachange retirees\", driving up house and land prices, and adversely affecting the ability of local young people and families to remain in the area. Employment prospects are largely limited to hospitality work, aged care and the building trades which continue to benefit from rapid growth in the region.\n\nIn 2007, Port Elliot became the focus of unwanted media attention due to the murder of 15-year-old Carly Ryan at Lady Bay. On 21 January 2010, a 50-year-old man from Victoria was found guilty of the murder while his son was found not guilty.\n\nLittle penguins once bred at Freeman's Knob. In 1981 a dog attack left at least 10 adult penguins dead and numerous eggs broken and empty. It was posited that this event may have rendered the colony extinct.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1923013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923013", "title": "Genesis 1:2", "text": "Genesis 1:2\n\nGenesis 1:2 is the second verse of the Genesis creation narrative. It is a part of the Torah portion Bereshit ().\n\nMasoretic text\n\nTransliteration:\n\n\n\"Tohu wabohu\" is commonly translated as \"formless and empty\", and denotes the absence of some abstract quality such as purpose or worth. \"Tohu\" by itself means desert, desert-like, empty, uninhabited (see Jeremiah 4:23 and Isaiah 34:11), so that \"Tohu wabohu\" signifies that the earth was empty of life, whether plant, animal, or human. \"Tehôm\" was the cosmic ocean both above and below the earth. \"Ruah\" means \"wind\"; the wind blows (rather than hovers) \"‘al-pənê hammāyim\", over the face of the waters of Tehom.\n\nGenesis 1:2 presents an initial condition of creation - namely, that it is \"tohu wa-bohu\", formless and void. This serves to introduce the rest of the chapter, which describes a process of forming and filling. That is, on the first three days the heavens, the sky and the land is formed, and they are filled on days four to six by luminaries, birds and fish, and animals and man respectively.\n\nBefore God begins to create, the world is ' (): the word ' by itself means \"emptiness, futility\"; it is used to describe the desert wilderness. ' has no known meaning and was apparently coined to rhyme with and reinforce '. It appears again in Jeremiah 4:23, where Jeremiah warns Israel that rebellion against God will lead to the return of darkness and chaos, \"as if the earth had been ‘uncreated’.\" ', chaos, is the condition that ', ordering, remedies.\n\nDarkness and \"Deep\" ( ') are two of the three elements of the chaos represented in ' (the third is the formless earth). In the \"Enûma Eliš\", the Deep is personified as the goddess Tiamat, the enemy of Marduk; here it is the formless body of primeval water surrounding the habitable world, later to be released during the Deluge, when \"all the fountains of the great deep burst forth\" from the waters beneath the earth and from the \"windows\" of the sky. William Dumbrell notes that the reference to the \"deep\" in this verse \"alludes to the detail of the ancient Near Eastern cosmologies\" in which \"a general threat to order comes from the unruly and chaotic sea, which is finally tamed by a warrior god.\" Dumbrell goes on to suggest that Genesis 1:2 \"reflects something of the chaos/order struggle characteristic of ancient cosmologies\".\n\nThe \"Spirit of God\" hovering over the waters in some translations of Genesis 1:2 comes from the Hebrew phrase \"\", which has alternately been interpreted as a \"great wind\". Victor P. Hamilton decides, somewhat tentatively, for \"spirit of God\", but dismisses any suggestion that this can be identified with the Holy Spirit of Christian theology.<ref></ref >\n\"Rûach\" () has the meanings \"wind, spirit, breath,\" and ' can mean \"great\" as well as \"god\". The ' which moves over the Deep may therefore mean the \"wind/breath of God\" (the storm-wind is God's breath in Psalms 18:15 and elsewhere, and the wind of God returns in the Flood story as the means by which God restores the earth), or God's \"spirit\", a concept which is somewhat vague in Hebrew bible, or simply a great storm-wind.\n\n\n\n"}
