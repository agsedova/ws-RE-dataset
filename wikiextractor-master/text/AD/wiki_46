It was written by Madonna and Rick Nowels, and was produced by the singer with William Orbit and Patrick Leonard. The song was released as the fourth single from the album on September 22, 1998, being additionally distributed as a double A-Side single in the United Kingdom with \"Little Star\". Lyrically, the track talks about how free and empowering saying good-bye or ending a relationship can feel. The melancholy electronica ballad features shuffle beats, acoustic guitars and sweeping strings arranged by Craig Armstrong.\n\n\"The Power of Good-Bye\" received acclaim from music critics, who went on to recognize the song as one of the best on \"Ray of Light\", with praise going to its instrumentation and electronic vibe, as well as Madonna's vocals which were compared to \"Frozen\" (1998). The song attained commercial success across Europe, reaching the top 10 of the charts in over nine countries, including Austria, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Spain and the United Kingdom, while in the United States it reached number 11, becoming Madonna's 37th top 20 hit and her seventh-highest debut at the time. Its blue-green tinted music video was directed by Matthew Rolston in Malibu, California and features actor Goran Višnjić as her love interest. Madonna has performed the song live on several award shows and during various appearances on television but has never included it in the standard set list on tour.\n\nBetween 1996 and the release of this song's associated album in 1998, Madonna went through a number of \"life-changing experiences\" including giving birth to her daughter Lourdes, interest in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah, as well as playing the title role in the film adaptation of the musical \"Evita\" (1996). A year later, following the promotion of the Evita soundtrack, she started working on \"Ray of Light\"; the album would reflect her changed perspectives about life. Madonna wrote songs with William Orbit, Patrick Leonard and Rick Nowels.\nIn the meantime, Madonna had written \"The Power of Good-Bye\" with Nowels; it was one of the nine songs they had written for the album. Nowels had always wanted to work with Madonna, admiring her previous work with Leonard, Stephen Bray as well as Nile Rodgers. The songwriter was in New York for the Grammy Awards, and during a shopping expedition in Barneys, he met Madonna. Nowels commended the singer on her songwriting skills, being later invited to Los Angeles for writing sessions. According to Lucy O'Brien, author of \"\", \"[Nowels] was struck by [Madonna's] lyric writing\", admitting that, \"It was deep, poetic and intelligent. When she's on and at her best she's on a par with Joni Mitchell or Paul Simon\". He also stated that the singer's songwriting prowess was benefited from her \"voracious reading\". Three songs from their sessions were selected for the final track list, \"The Power of Good-Bye\", \"Little Star\" and \"To Have and Not to Hold\".\n\nAfter issuing \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" as the album's third single worldwide, \"The Power of Good-Bye\" was chosen to be released as the album's fourth single, since \"radio programmers and diehard fans [had] long been clamoring [for it].\" In the United States, the song was the album's third single, available from September 22, 1998 in a two-track format. In the United Kingdom, \"The Power of Good-Bye\" was distributed as a double A-side with \"Little Star\". In the rest of Europe, the latter was included on the single releases as a B-side. In the European maxi-singles, several experimental remixes of the track by Luke Slater and an additional remix by Dallas Austin, who previously worked with Madonna on her \"Bedtime Stories\" (1994) album, were included. As noted by AllMusic Jose F. Promis, the \"Luke Slater's Super Luper Mix\" \"turns the ballad into a thumping deep house anthem, making it sound like a completely different song.\" Meanwhile, \"Fabien's Good God Mix\" is described as \"an electronic, tripped-out, drum'n'bass-heavy mix which keeps the integrity of the original song\", Promis noted.\n\nAfter the songwriting sessions ended with Nowels, Madonna started collaborating with Orbit and Leonard for recording the tracks. However, since Leonard could not delve much studio time, Madonna worked solely with Orbit. Around June 1997, the singer entered the Larrabee North Studio, Universal City, California to record the album, accompanied by Orbit, an engineer and a tape operator. According to Orbit, \"Most of the tracks pre-existed, so Madonna would work on vocals and lyrics at home, or driving around in her car.\" The producer was initially uncomfortable with the singer around the studio checking the recording process, but gradually entered into a work dynamics with her. However, his disorganized nature almost got him fired when he reached Madonna's house to play \"The Power of Goodbye\" and realized that he had carried the wrong DAT file. Madonna was not impressed and Orbit had to \"virtually\" remain in the studio for a week and deliver the final track.\n\"The Power of Good-Bye\" features production credit from Madonna, Orbit and Leonard, while Craig Armstrong was responsible for string arrangement. It was written in the time signature of common time, and is composed in the key of F minor with a moderate tempo of 80 beats per minute. Madonna's vocals range from G to C and the song follows a basic sequence of Fm–D–A–E as its chord progression. It is an electronica melancholy ballad, with its arrangement being \"anchored by a crisp shuffle beat and sweetened by occasional orchestral string flourishes and contrasting acoustic guitar strumming.\n\nAccording to Rikky Rooksby, author of \"The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna\", \"The Power of Good-Bye\" begins with a four-chord arpeggio sequence. It has \"catchy\" melody phrases during the verses and a synth trumpet at the end of the first chorus, as well as Armstrong's strings present in the background. It also contains sustained notes on the instrumental sections, a characteristic for the songs on \"Ray of Light\". Doubled acoustic guitar chords give an organic vibe during the beginning of the second verse, following a brief coda. The song also infuses computer blips and techno effect sounds, which Orbit achieved by using a Korg MS-20 analog synthesizer. The producer explained that \"[t]here's something about [the MS-20's] transient peaks that are very spiky. And you can make that machine scream. Its two filters are very severe\".\n\nLyrically, \"The Power of Good-Bye\" talks the strength that comes in letting go, and it was considered \"a sort of sonic sister to 'Frozen'\", since both deal with themes of a heart closed towards love. This is emphasized in the lyrics, \"Your heart is not open so I must go\" as well as \"Freedom comes when you learn to let go, Creation comes when you learn to say no\". The idea for using detachment as the inspiration for the song stemmed from Madonna's interest in Buddhist philosophy, as well as practicing Yoga. Nowels described the lyrics as \"stunning\" and commended its confessional nature. He also described the track as a \"meditation\" and \"a beautiful poem\". Australian music critic and friend of Madonna, Molly Meldrum, claimed the lyrics were about the singer's former husband Sean Penn. The lyrical content was also compared to literary works of William Shakespeare, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic picked \"The Power of Good-Bye\" as one of \"Ray of Light\"s highlights, while Amy Pettifer of \"The Quietus\" called it \"one of [the singer]'s finest moments\". Larry Flick of \"Billboard\" praised the fact that \"[Madonna] brilliantly nestles a dewy love ballad within a cutting-edge electronic pop framework.\" He noted that \"[one] can listen to this track a dozen times and still pluck something new from the richly layered arrangement\", while highlighting Madonna's vocals, writing that she \"performs with a confidence that allows her to flawlessly merge a widened vocal range with a considerable dose of raw emotion and soul.\" Bryan Lark of \"The Michigan Daily\" picked the song and \"Frozen\" as \"the album's best two tracks\", noting that both proved that \"[Madonna] still likes to get into the groove, explaining why this a techno album and not part of the 'Mood' series.\" Greg Kot of the \"Chicago Tribune\" felt that the \"rapturous sweep of '[The] Power of Good-Bye' [proves that] Madonna has succeeded where all of her pop peers have failed: She's made not just street-smart disco, but smart pop.\" Authors Allen Metz and Carol Benson wrote in \"The Madonna Companion\" that the track, along with \"Frozen\" and \"To Have and Not to Hold\" from the album, formed a \"dream trilogy\" during which Madonna does a monologue with herself, talking about divinity.\n\nRachel Brodsky of \"Spin\" remarked that both \"The Power of Good-Bye\" and \"Frozen\" were able to \"cement the mainstream crossover of a dance culture once relegated to illegal basement parties\". Elysa Gardner of the \"Los Angeles Times\" perceived that \"Madonna's enduring knack for incorporating hip and exotic textures into accessible pop tunes is evident on avant-leaning dance tracks such as 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-bye'.\" Charlotte Robinson of \"PopMatters\" praised the inclusion of the recording and other Orbit tracks on Madonna's 2001 compilation album \"GHV2\", for representing \"a testament to [the producer's] ability to use gadgets and electronic wizardry not to alienate listeners, but to draw them in\". Sal Cinquemani of \"Slant Magazine\" gave an A– grade to the song for its composition, writing that it was \"[s]tructured like your average adult contemporary ballad with enough electronic sheen to sound edgy, 'The Power of Goodbye' was the ultimate in electronica-lite.\" While ranking Madonna's singles in honor of her 60th birthday, \"The Guardian\"s Jude Rogers placed the track at number 29, calling it one of \"Ray of Light\"s \"many powerful sub-aquatic electronic\" ballads. Similarly, \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Chuck Arnold listed \"The Power of Good-Bye\" as the singer's 41st best single, writing that \"a knowing reference to the wide-eyed plea of her earlier hit 'Open Your Heart', this gorgeous goodbye almost makes the heartache worth it\". Medium's Richard LaBeau deemed it \"one of the most underrated songs of Madonna’s career, this melancholy electronica ballad is one of her most deeply affecting\".\n\n\"The Power of Good-Bye\" entered the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart at number 24 on the issue for the week ending October 17, 1998, becoming Madonna's 16th single to debut inside the top 40 and also her 38th overall top 40 hit. It also became the seventh-highest debut of her career. It eventually peaked at number 11 on the week ending November 28, 1998. According to Jose F. Promis of AllMusic, what kept the song from reaching the top 10 was because \"[its maxi CD], unfortunately, never saw the light of day in the U.S.\" \"The Power of Good-Bye\" was present for a total of 19 weeks on the Hot 100. In Canada, the song debuted at number 87 on the \"RPM\" Top Singles chart. It reached a peak of number 16 on the chart after 10 weeks.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the song had better chart placement. The A-side with \"Little Star\" debuted at number six on the UK Singles Chart, and was present for a total of 11 weeks, selling 175,095 copies as of August 2008, according to the Official Charts Company. It became Madonna's 36th best-selling single in that country and in May 2018 was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The CD version of the song charted separately, debuting and peaking at number 91.\n\nIn countries like Austria, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Scotland, Spain and Switzerland \"The Power of Good-Bye\" was able to reach the top 10. Its high chart placements enabled the track to debut at number two on the pan-Eurochart Hot 100 Singles, behind \"Believe\" (1998) by singer Cher. It further attained Gold certifications from Austria, Germany and Sweden. In Spain, \"The Power of Good-Bye\" was the only single from \"Ray of Light\" to not reach number one, meanwhile in Australia the song was her first single since \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\" (1996) to miss the top 20 peaking at number 33.\n\nThe music video for \"The Power of Good-Bye\" was directed by Matthew Rolston, and was filmed from August 8–10, 1998 at Silvertop House in Los Angeles, California and Malibu Beach. According to \"Entertainment Tonight\", the filming was emotional for Madonna due to the song's meaning of break-up and \"love story gone wrong\". She wanted to make the visual's storyline dramatic, hence chose Rolston as the director and together they concocted the emotional narrative of the clip. Although she respected the director's vision of the clip, Madonna nevertheless wanted to be a part of the creative process of the videotaping. The scenes of the singer walking along the beach were shot with her actually walking on a treadmill.\nMadonna's lover in the video is played by Croatian actor Goran Višnjić, who was selected by the singer after she saw his acting in the British film \"Welcome to Sarajevo\" (1997). Calling him \"the sexiest male working today\", Madonna explained that \"[she] was looking for an actor to be in [the] video and his face came right into my head\". The video premiered on MTV on September 10, 1998, a few minutes before the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards show began. It was occasionally played on The Warner Bros. Network after the television show \"Felicity\", which played the song as the background music during its TV ads.\n\nThe video shows Madonna and Višnjić playing chess and ultimately the singer destroying the chess board, symbolizing an end to their relationship. She then goes walking by the sea, passing a man walking his dog on the beach. Intercut are scenes of Madonna singing the song in front of a curtain. The video is color graded to a blue-green tint and the chess scene was inspired by that in the 1968 heist film \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" (with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway). Listing the clip at number 23 on their countdown of \"Madonna's 55 Best Videos\", Louis Virtel from The Backlot said that the singer looked \"startlingly gorgeous, and her throes of agony at video's end occur in only the loveliest, bluest light.\"\n\nThe scenes showing Madonna walking alone on the beach was an homage to actress Joan Crawford in the 1946 film \"Humoresque\". Christopher Rosa from VH1 listed it as one of Madonna's 10 Most Underrated Videos. He compared the blue-tinged visuals to the video for \"Frozen\", but found the plot to be more complex. Rosa also noted that the ending showing Madonna walking towards the sea was purposefully ambiguous. \"Does Madonna drown herself in the ocean? Does she move on from her lover? Whatever the case, there is no denying this moody video is one of Madge's most effective ever,\" he concluded. The video can be found on the Madonna compilations, \"\" (1999) and \"\" (2009).\n\nMadonna first performed \"The Power of Good-Bye\" on October 23, 1998, during the VH1 and \"Vogue\" Fashion Awards, dressed in black latex and leather, accompanied by the children of Opus 118 from The Harlem School of the Arts. On November 12, the singer performed the song on the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards in Assago, Italy, dressed in black. John Dingwall from \"Daily Record\" noted that Madonna \"struggled\" on delivering the performance, as she seemed nervous. \"The Power of Good-Bye\" was also one of the few singles that Madonna has performed on the BBC program \"Top of the Pops\", which aired seven days later. On November 23, 1998, she appeared on the Spanish RTVE show \"A La Carta\" and performed \"The Power of Good-Bye\", along with her European single, \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\".\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Ray of Light\".\n\n\n"}

Conceived as a bizarre antihero, RanXerox was a mechanical creature made from Xerox photocopier parts.\n\nAt first (1978, in Italian, in \"Cannibale\") the name was \"Rank Xerox\", identical to that of a joint venture between the Xerox Corporation of the U.S. and the Rank Organisation of the U.K., the latter of which manufactures and markets Xerox equipment in Europe. Due to a threatened lawsuit by Rank Xerox for using their trademarked name, Tamburini changed it to \"RanXerox\" (1980, also in Italian, in \"Frigidaire\"). The name \"Ranx\" has also been used in some cases. The first time RanXerox was published in English was in the July 1983 issue of \"Heavy Metal\". Many more issues of \"Heavy Metal\", as well as novels followed, featuring RanXerox (such as \"RanXerox in America\"). The artist uses Pantone pens to create his unique style of art.\n\nRichard Corben said about the character:\nTanino Liberatore also created the artwork for the Frank Zappa album \"The Man from Utopia\"; the image of Zappa on the cover bears a strong resemblance to RanXerox.\n\n\"Ranx: The Video Game\" was developed by Ubisoft in 1990 for DOS, Amiga, and Atari ST.\n\n"}

Presumably there must have been an earlier structure on the site as the 1st Earl was \"Captain of Desmond Castle\". \n\nIt was used as a Customs House until 1641 when it was converted into a naval prison, following the construction of a new Customs House. The prisoners kept in the Castle were in the main French and Spanish, and the building became known locally as the \"French Prison\" as a result.\n\nIn January 1747, a fire broke out, killing 54 of the prisoners. In 1791, the castle was donated by James Kearney MP to the town of Kinsale, and it was subsequently used as a town gaol till 1846, and during the Irish Famine as a workhouse. In 1938, it was taken into government hands, and in the 1990s was restored and opened to the public by the Office of Public Works.\n\nIn 1997, the International Museum of Wine, which details the links between Ireland and the wine trade, and is run by the Order of the Wine Geese, was added.\n\n"}
{"id": "2246015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246015", "title": "Alpine A310", "text": "Alpine A310\n\nThe Alpine A310 is a sports car built by French manufacturer Alpine, from 1971 to 1985.\nDieppe-based Alpine, once an independent company specialising in faster Renaults, later a Renault subsidiary, established a fine competition history with the Alpine A110 winning the 1973 Monte Carlo Rally and World Rally Championship. The successor was the Alpine A310, initially powered by tuned 17TS/Gordini four-cylinder engine, still rear-mounted. The maximum power reaches , thanks to the use of two twin-barrel 45 DCOE Weber carburetors.\nThe first model of the A310, built 1971-1976, was a car with a four-cylinder engine and six headlights. Being larger, heavier, and no more powerful than its predecessor, the A310 was generally considered underpowered. The car was first shown at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show. The prototype A310 had louvres across the rear windscreen; these were not carried over to the production model. Early models had a NACA duct mounted near the window atop the left front fender, later four-cylinder cars received two, mounted closer to the front of the car. In 1976, to help flagging sales, the lower-cost A310 SX was presented. This model has a version of the Renault 16/17's 1647 cc inline-four and simplified equipment.\n\nThe basis of the A310 was a hefty tubular steel backbone chassis, clothed in a fiberglass shell. As for the previous A110 the entire body was molded in a single piece. Like the ill-fated DeLorean, which used the same PRV powertrain, the engine was mounted longitudinally in the rear, driving forward to the wheels through a manual five-speed gearbox. The driving position was low and sporty, although the front wheelwells encroached on the occupants' feet, pointing them towards the centre of the car. The A310 was labor-intensive, having been developed for small-scale artisanal production - a car took 130 hours to build from start to finish. The front axle also came in for some criticism, although in 1974 the balljoint mountings were replaced by rubber/steel bushings (silent-blocs) which somewhat improved durability. While many bits of the A310 came from the Renault parts shelf as expected, others are more surprising - the steering rack is from the Peugeot 504, while the turn signals are Simca 1301 units.\n\nIn 1976 the A310 was restyled by Robert Opron and fitted with the more powerful and newly developed 90-degree 2664 cc V6 PRV engine, as used in some Renaults, Volvos and Peugeots. The later V6 received a black plastic rear spoiler as well, useful for keeping the tail planted but somewhat marring the purity of the original's lines. With on tap, the A310 PRV V6 was Renault's performance flagship capable of 220 km/h (137 mph) and acceptable acceleration. The tail-heavy weight distribution gave handling characteristics similar to the contemporary Porsche 911. Sales did pick up, more than doubling those of the four-cylinder predecessor, but then tapered off as production continued without any updates to make it a serious Porsche competitor in the marketplace. Sales were predominantly in France, with 781 cars sold in its home market in 1979 (its best year). By 1984 less than five hundred Alpines were sold in France, while Porsche sold about 1600 in spite of industrial strikes in Germany.\n\nBeginning with model year 1981 (in late 1980), the rear suspension was shared with the mid-engined Renault 5 Turbo. Rather than the previous three-lug wheels, the A310 also received the alloys used for the 5 Turbo, albeit without the painted elements.\nIn the later models (1983-1984) of the A310 a \"Pack GT\" which was inspired from the Group 4 A310 racing cars would be developed, it gained wheel arches and larger spoilers front and rear. A few Alpine A310 V6 Pack GT Kit Boulogne were built (27 examples), here the PRV V6 was bored out to 2.9 litres and was then further modified by Alpine, fitted with triple Weber 42DCNF carburetors that pushed power to .\n\n1977 - French Rally Championship\nThe A310 had great success in French motorsport as a Group 4 car. In 1977 Guy Frequelin (Alpine Renault A 310-V6) won the French Rally championship.\n\nA310 1600 Series 1 (55 L fuel tank, 3 stud suspension, four-cylinder engine, 5-speed transmission)\n"}

The station is situated between and and is from .\n\nThe railway arrived here in 1838. A minor request stop was immediately opened and a station built and named \"Ditton Marsh,\" being the wetter part of Ditton Common. The common marks the boundary between what was then the west of Thames Ditton and Esher. The station was opened on 21 May 1838, and the name changed to \"Esher and Hampton Court\" about 1840.

{"id": "2246027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246027", "title": "Battle of Bedriacum", "text": "Battle of Bedriacum\n\nThe Battle of Bedriacum refers to two battles fought during the Year of the Four Emperors (AD 69) near the village of Bedriacum (now \"Calvatone\"), about from the town of Cremona in northern Italy. The fighting in fact took place between Bedriacum and Cremona, and the battles are sometimes called \"First Cremona\" and \"Second Cremona\".\n\nMarcus Salvius Otho, with the support and aid of the Praetorian Guard, had his predecessor Galba murdered in January and claimed the throne. Legate Aulus Vitellius, governor of the province of Germania Inferior, had also claimed the throne earlier in the month and marched on Rome with his troops. Vitellius' forces were divided into two armies, one commanded by Aulus Caecina Alienus and the other by Fabius Valens. The Vitellian forces included legions XXI \"Rapax\", V \"Alaudae\", and powerful vexillationes from all the other legions stationed on the Rhine, together with a strong force of Batavian auxiliaries, totalling a force of around 70,000 men. The forces commanded by Caecina crossed the Alps by the Great St. Bernard Pass to reach northern Italy. They attacked Placentia but were repulsed by the Othonian garrison and fell back on Cremona to await the arrival of Valens' army.\n\nOtho left Rome on March 14 and marched north to meet the challenge, leaving his brother Titianus in charge of Rome. He made his base at Brixellum. His forces included legions I \"Adiutrix\", XIII \"Gemina\", a forward detachment of XIIII \"Gemina\", the Praetorian Guard, and a force of gladiators. His general staff included generals such as Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, who, as governor of Britain, had defeated Boudica eight years before but Otho decided to call his brother Titianus from Rome to act as his commander in chief.\n\nBefore Titianus arrived, one engagement had already been fought. Caecina tried to set an ambush at Locus Castorum, a village about half way between Bedriacum and Cremona on the Via Postumia. The Othonians were warned and their army marched for Locus Castorum, led by Suetonius Paulinus. The Othonians had the better of the fighting and Caecina's troops retreated to Cremona. Here they were joined by Valens' army, which had followed a longer route through Gaul.\n\nTitanius had now joined the Othonian armies and took command. It was decided to march on Cremona to give battle, against the advice of Paulinus and other generals, who wished to wait until other legions had arrived. Otho remained at Brixellum to await the outcome. On 14 April the two armies met on the Via Postumia, nearer Cremona than Bedriacum, with the Othonian troops already tired after a long march. Some of the heaviest fighting was where Otho's I \"Adiutrix\" legion, recently raised from the marines of \"Classis Ravennas\" at Ravenna, clashed with Vitellius' veteran \"Rapax\". The \"Adiutrix\" acquitted itself well, capturing the eagle of the 21st, though its commanding officer was killed as the 21st strove to recover it. Elsewhere on the battlefield, Otho's 13th legion was defeated by Vitellius' \"Alaudae\" and the \"Adiutrix\" eventually gave way when a force of Batavian auxiliaries took them in the flank. According to Dio Cassius, about 40,000 men were killed in the fighting. The Othonian troops fled back to their camp in Bedriacum and the next day surrendered to the Vitellian forces and took the oath of allegiance to Vitellius.\n\nWhen news of the defeat was brought to Brixellum, many of Otho's troops urged him to fight on, pointing out that more troops were on the way, but Otho chose suicide rather than cause more deaths. He had been emperor for fewer than three months; Vitellius continued his march on Rome, where he made a triumphal entry and was recognized as emperor by the Senate.\n\nMeanwhile, the legions stationed in the Middle East provinces of Judaea and Syria had acclaimed Vespasian as emperor. Vespasian had been given a special command in Judaea by Nero in 67 with the task of putting down the Great Jewish Revolt. He gained the support of the governor of Syria, Gaius Licinius Mucianus and a strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus.\n\nBefore the eastern legions could reach Rome, the Danubian legions of the provinces of Raetia and Moesia also acclaimed Vespasian as emperor in August. Three of these legions, III \"Gallica\", VIII \"Augusta\", and VII \"Claudia\" had been on their way to support Otho when they heard of his defeat at the first battle of Bedriacum. They had been made to swear allegiance to Vitellius, but when they heard of Vespasian's bid for power they switched their support to him. They persuaded the other two legions, VII \"Galbiana\" and XIII \"Gemina\" to join them, which the XIII \"Gemina\" did all the more readily as they were one of the legions which had been defeated at First Bedriacum, and had been made to build amphitheatres for Valens and Caecina as punishment. Led by the commanding officer of the VII \"Galbiana\", Marcus Antonius Primus, they marched on Rome, and having a shorter distance to march reached Italy before Mucianus' troops.\n\nWhen Vitellius heard of Antonius' approach, he dispatched Caecina with a powerful army composed of XXI \"Rapax\", V \"Alaudae\", I \"Italica\", and XXII \"Primigenia\" together with detachments from seven other legions and a force of auxiliaries. The first of Antonius' legions had arrived at Verona, but though urged to attack them before the remainder of the army arrived, Caecina declined to do so. Caecina had been plotting with Lucilius Bassus, commander of the \"Classis Ravennas\", the Roman fleet at Ravenna, to switch their support to Vespasian. His troops refused to follow his lead however, and put him in chains. Valens, who had been delayed by illness, had by now set out from Rome.\n\nCaecina's army, now without their general, advanced on Cremona. Antonius was now based at Bedriacum, and advanced towards Cremona with a force of cavalry. They encountered the vanguard of the Vitellian army between Bedriacum and Cremona on 24 October and a battle followed, with Antonius sending back to Bedriacum for the legions. Antonius' troops had the better of the fighting, and the Vitellian troops retreated to their camp outside Cremona.\n\nAntonius' forces advanced along the Via Postumia towards Cremona. They were opposed by a powerful Vitellian army, who had been reinforced by other legions including Legion IV \"Macedonica\", but were still without a commander as Valens had not yet arrived. By now night had fallen and the battle continued through the hours of darkness. The VII \"Galbiana\", Antonius' own legion, suffered heavy casualties and lost its eagle for a while, though one of its centurions later sacrificed his own life to win it back. Eventually Antonius' forces began to gain the upper hand, and the turning point came when dawn broke. Antonius' III \"Gallica\" had served in Syria for many years and while there had adopted a local custom. As the sun rose, they saluted it with cheers; this was misinterpreted by the Vitellian forces, who thought that they were greeting reinforcements from the east and lost heart. The Vitellian forces were driven back into their camp, which was taken by Antonius' forces. Antonius then attacked Cremona itself, which surrendered. Cremona was sacked and then burned by the victorious troops. Antonius was embarrassed by the episode and forbade the keeping of Cremonans as slaves, resulting in many being murdered by their captors to evade punishment.\n\nAntonius continued to Rome, where Vitellius was taken prisoner and shortly afterwards killed. The way was thus cleared for Vespasian to ascend the throne near the end of this bloody year of crisis.\n\n"}

In March 2002 Corson was replaced as alto by Naomi Crellin. Delaney-Brown was replaced on soprano in February 2007 by Sally Cameron. They won the Best Jazz Album category at the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 for \"Feels Like Spring\" (collaboration with James Morrison) and again in 2013 for \"Smile\".\n\nThe Idea of North were formed as a jazz-based, a cappella quartet, in Canberra in 1993, by Nick Begbie (tenor), Meg Corson (alto), Trish Delaney-Brown (soprano) and Andrew Piper (bass). All four members were students at the Canberra School of Music of Australian National University. The group's name is from \"The Idea of North\" (1967), a radio documentary by Canadian classical pianist, Glenn Gould. The group are generally described as a jazz quartet, but they also sing pop, R&B, classical, folk, soul and gospel. They cover material by the Beatles, Peter Allen, the Muppets, Aretha Franklin and Bee Gees.\n\nIn 1997 they issued their debut album, \"The Idea of North\", with Ra Khan producing at the Canberra School of Music's recording studios. The group members arranged cover versions of both traditional and more recent material. Instrumentation was provided by Greg Stott on congas and percussion on three tracks and Piper on flugelhorn on \"My Funny Valentine\". In 1999 they collaborated with jazz musician, James Morrison, and country singer, Gina Jeffreys, to record a cover version of \"Blue Christmas\" which appears on Jeffreys' album, \"Christmas Wish\" (November 1999). Morrison felt the ensemble were \"the best contemporary a cappella group in the country.\"\n\nThe Idea of North's second album, \"The Sum of Us\", appeared in October 2001, its track, \"Mas Que Nada\", features Morrison on trombone and another track, \"Fragile\", showcases Don Burrows on flute. Delaney-Brown wrote two tracks, \"Neat Surprise\" and \"Gotta Move On\", while \"Singin a Capella\" was co-written by Begbie and Piper and \"Two Sides to the Story\" was written by Piper. It was co-produced by the group's members and recorded at Tiger Studios, Sydney for Magnetic Records. It reached No. 15 on the ARIA Jazz & Blues Albums chart.\n\nIn March 2002 Corson was replaced as alto in the group by Naomi Crellin (ex-Pure Harmony), a graduate from University of Adelaide's Elder Conservatorium. Corson started her solo career; during 2014 she teamed with Stott on guitar as a musical duo. Crellin's previous group, Pure Harmony, are an a capella quartet formed in 1992 at Marryatville High School, Adelaide with fellow students Sally Cameron and Joy Hague.\n\nThe Idea of North's third album, \"Here & Now\", was released in October 2003 via ABC Jazz, which has re-recordings of their previous material plus two new tracks. The line-up of Begbie, Crellin, Delaney-Brown and Piper recorded it at Australian Broadcasting Corporation's studio 227, Sydney. It reached No. 13 on the ARIA Hitseekers Albums Chart and No. 8 on the ARIA Jazz & Blues Albums chart.\n\nSan Francisco-based, Contemporary A Cappella Society, present the Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards. In 2004 the Idea of North were runners up for Artist of the Year. At the 2005 ceremony they won best jazz album for \"Evidence\" (17 May 2004) and best jazz song for \"Rachel\". \"Evidence\" peaked at No. 12 on the ARIA Jazz & Blues Albums chart.\n\nTheir next album, \"The Gospel Project\" (April 2006), featured prayers and three tracks, \"Let It Ring\", \"Help Us\" and \"The Truth\" co-written by Begbie and Michael Leunig. Aside from vocals by Begbie, Crellin, Delaney-Brown and Piper four of the recordings included instrumentals: Duncan Brown on bass guitar, Bill Risby on keyboards and Gordon Rytmeister on drums. During that year they had appeared at festivals in Germany, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea. In October they toured Australia to promote the album with the Gospel Project Band.\n\nOn 2 July 2007 they issued their first live album, \"Live at the Powerhouse\", both on CD and as a DVD. Barry O'Sullivan of \"All About Jazz\" described how the \"a capella vocal ensemble just swings and swings with impeccable harmonies and an understanding of each others' vocal parts. The breadth of the group's performance is its most remarkable characteristic, never stopping in offering something new with tracks.\" It was recorded at the Brisbane Powerhouse on 4 June 2006 with the DVD directed and edited by Adam Sébire, while the audio was recorded by David Hemming and produced by the group.\n\nSally Cameron (ex-Pure Harmony, South Australian Police Band) joined as soprano in February 2007 to replace Delaney-Brown, who left to start her family. The group farewelled Delaney-Brown, formally, in a one-off concert at The Basement, Sydney in June 2008. She later became a member of Sonic Mayhem Orchestra and then James Valentine Quartet before establishing the Trish Delaney-Brown Quintet.\n\nThe group's sixth studio album, \"Feels Like Spring\" (10 April 2010), another collaboration with Morrison, peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Jazz & Blues Albums chart and spent 33 weeks (non-consecutive) in the top 20 until February 2011. In the studio, instrumentation was supplied by Begbie on tenor saxophone and trombone; Brown on bass guitar; Cameron on alto saxophone and trumpet; Ian Cooper on strings; Sandro Constatino on viola; Crellin on alto saxophone and trumpet; Alexandra D'ella on violin; Phillip Hartl on violin; Morrison on double bass, flugelhorn, horn arrangements, piano, saxophone, trombone and trumpet; James Muller on guitar; Piper on bass guitar, baritone saxophone and trombone; Rytmeister on drums; Sunnil de Silva on percussion; Adrian Wallis on cello; and Jonathan Zwartz on double bass. It was co-produced by the group and Morrison.\n\nAt the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 Idea of North and James Morrison won the trophy for Best Jazz Album for \"Feels Like Spring\". At the ARIA Music Awards of 2011 the ensemble were nominated for Best Jazz Album for their seventh studio album, \"Extraordinary Tale\" (29 July 2011). For the solely a capella recording Begbie, Cameron, Crellin and Piper provided their usual four part harmony with Piper adding vocal percussion. \"Extraordinary Tale\" peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Jazz & Blues Albums, No. 5 on the Hitseekers Albums and No. 93 on the Top 100 Physical Albums charts. Also in 2011 Crellin temporarily left, on maternity leave, and was replaced on alto by Joy Hague (ex-Pure Harmony) with Crellin returning in the following year. Hague resumed her work as a high school music teacher although she filled in as deputy alto in the Idea of North as required thereafter.\n\nThe quartet recorded their eighth studio album, \"This Christmas\" (29 October 2012), which includes Morrison guesting on trombone on two tracks, and Hague as alto on three tracks. The album peaked at No. 80 on the ARIA Albums, No. 72 on the Top 100 Physical Albums, No. 2 on the Hitseekers Albums and No. 2 on the Jazz & Blues Albums charts. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2013 the Idea of North won Best Jazz Album, again, for their ninth studio album, \"Smile\" (12 August 2013), which had peaked at No. 86 on the ARIA Albums, No. 93 on the Top 100 Physical Albums, No. 4 on the Hitseekers Albums and No. 2 on the Jazz & Blues Albums charts.\n\nThe Idea of North issued a compilation album, \"Anthology\" (17 November 2014), which peaked at No. 5 on the Jazz & Blues Albums charts. From 2016 Japanese vocal percussionist Kaichiro Kitamura was a session and touring member and featured on three tracks on their tenth studio album, \"Ballads\" (18 April 2016). The album reached No. 3 on the Hitseekers Albums and No. 2 on the Jazz & Blues Albums charts. In February 2017 Cameron and Piper both left the group; Piper was replaced on bass by Luke Thompson, while Cameron's temporary replacements were Delaney-Brown and Jo Lawry, prior to a more permanent soprano to be appointed later that year.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2246043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246043", "title": "Lymond Chronicles", "text": "Lymond Chronicles\n\nThe Lymond Chronicles is a series of six novels written by Dorothy Dunnett and first published between 1961 and 1975. Set in mid-16th-century Europe and the Mediterranean area, the series tells the story of a young Scottish nobleman, Francis Crawford of Lymond, from 1547 through 1558.\n\nThe six volumes follow the life and career of the charismatic Francis Crawford of Lymond, the younger son of the Crawfords of Culter, members of the landed aristocracy of the Scottish Lowlands. Brought up according to the Renaissance ideal of an educated autodidact, he is a polyglot, knowledgeable in literature, philosophy, mathematics and the sciences, a practitioner of all the martial arts, a spell-binding musician, a talented thespian, and a master strategist with a genius for imaginative tactics.\n\nAn intensely private man with a very public persona, he is a non-conformist who is suspicious of political and religious causes. He is driven by his demanding personal code of behaviour and responsibility, regardless of society's expectations or rules. Though a cosmopolitan military leader, diplomat and spy, he has an abiding feeling for his home country of Scotland. Despite his reluctance to relinquish his cherished independence and align himself permanently with any nation's ruler, Lymond's professional reputation increasingly makes him a sought-after ally, or a foe to be avoided, by many of the crowned heads of Europe. Still, only for goals he believes in strongly will he deploy his glittering and commanding persona, quicksilver mind, talent for dissembling what he thinks or feels, and rapier tongue; and once he dedicates himself to a goal, his will is implacable.\n\nIn his personal life, Lymond has an unusual ability to inspire intense loyalty and even love in those who are attracted to him. But the Crawford family's history begins to produce more and more tensions, and these conflicts are exacerbated by the family's shared weaknesses: immense pride and a stubborn refusal to explain the reasons for their actions.\n\nAs a whole, the \"Lymond Chronicles\" tell how an arrogant, brilliant, but troubled individualist, though increasingly successful professionally, becomes alienated and isolated as a result of battles with forces he can't control, as well as with himself; and how he ultimately becomes reconciled with his country, his family and friends, and himself.\n\nDunnett paints on a large historical canvas, with details based on meticulous research in hundreds of primary and secondary sources. In addition to their original characters, the novels feature a large number of historical figures, often in important roles.\n\nThe historical setting is the incessant jockeying for power through treaties, alliances of convenience, political marriages, wars, and even piracy, among the English Tudors, the Holy Roman Empire of the Habsburgs, the French Valois, the Ottoman Empire of Suleiman the Magnificent, and their respective secular and religious allies, including the Stewarts of Scotland, the Knights of St. John, the corsairs of North Africa, and Tsar Ivan the Terrible of Russia. Each of the six books has several locations with the exception of the first, \"The Game of Kings\", which takes place almost exclusively in the Scottish Lowlands and the borders with England.\n\nThe novels examine the politics and culture of each court and its nobility as monarchies centralized their power; the intensifying controversies over the Reformation; implications of the Age of Discovery for political and economic power and knowledge; and the blurred boundaries between faith and reason in religion, esoterica such as alchemy and astrology, and science. In addition, the large number of women in positions of political power during this period (as rulers in their own name, as regents, as strong wives or mistresses of kings, or as heirs to thrones) affords an exploration of women's roles.\n\nThe six books together form a single story, told in chronological order. However, the first two books can be read as self-contained novels. The endings of the third and fifth novels have no real resolution, but lead directly to the story taken up in the fourth and sixth novels.\n\nMeanwhile, the six books of the \"Lymond Chronicles\" are part of what Dunnett viewed as a larger 14-volume work, together with the eight novels of \"The House of Niccolò\" series. \"The House of Niccolò,\" written after the \"Lymond Chronicles\", tells the tale of Lymond's ancestors in the previous century and alludes to events in the \"Lymond Chronicles\". Dunnett recommended readers begin with the \"Lymond Chronicles\" and then read \"The House of Niccolò\". As with the \"Lymond Chronicles\", \"The House of Niccolò\" features a number of historical figures as important characters. Both the historical and fictional characters are, however, taken from a wider variety of occupations and social classes than in the \"Lymond Chronicles\". There are significant differences in narrative approach and writing style between the series, reflecting in part the very different personal journey taken by the central character in each.\n\nThe six novels in the Lymond series are as follows:\n\nLiving mostly by his wits and his sword-arm in 16th-century Scotland, Francis Crawford of Lymond is a charismatic figure: polyglot scholar, soldier, musician, master of disguises, nobleman—and accused outlaw. After five years in exile, Lymond has recently returned to Scotland, in defiance of Scottish charges against him for pro-English treason and murder. He has assembled a band of mercenaries and ruffians who follow his ruthless leadership. The reader gradually learns that Lymond has returned with the goal of proving his innocence and restoring his name. To do so, he must find the man who framed him and condemned him to two years as a French galley slave before he managed to escape. His family, the Crawfords, also cannot avoid becoming entangled in the complex politics between England and Scotland, including the Anglo-Scottish wars, Scotland's alliance with France, and skirmishes in the Borders region.\n\nThe novel is constructed as an intricate mystery, punctuated by set pieces of adventure, high comedy, and intense drama. Will Lymond prove himself innocent, die in the attempt, or be captured and hanged? Moreover, who is Lymond, and what are his motives and his true relationships with the other characters? Lymond leaves no one indifferent to him: some of the key characters—such as Richard Crawford, third Baron Culter and Lymond's older brother, and Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox—are one-time friends or intimates who become his mortal enemies. Betrayals and double-crosses, both potential and actual, abound. The pieces of the mystery only fit together late in the story as revelations at a trial.\n\nA number of historical persons appear in the novel, many as important characters. They include members of the Scott clan including Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch, his wife, Janet Beaton, and his son William Scott of Kincurd, who becomes Lymond's second-in-command in his band of outlaws; Mary of Guise, the Queen Dowager of Scotland and her young daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots; and members of the Douglas family including Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, his brother Sir George Douglas, his daughter Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox (niece of Henry VIII), and Margaret's husband Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, a potential claimant to the Scottish throne if the young Mary, Queen of Scots, died. The English military leaders responsible for prosecuting the war of The Rough Wooing, Sir William Grey and Lord Thomas Wharton, also have prominent, and often comedic, roles.\n\n\n\n\nHaving cleared his name in Scotland, Lymond takes on an alias in order to infiltrate the French court and protect the young Mary, Queen of Scots from her would-be assassins. But in Europe's most decadent and reckless court, he finds it increasingly difficult to remember where play-acting ends and self-destructive excess begins.\n\n\n\n\nHis reputation freshly restored after his actions in France, Lymond travels to the Isle of Malta, home to the Crusading Order of Knights Hospitaller of St John, just before the Ottoman Turks lay siege to it. There he becomes embroiled in a contest of wits with a man who may or may not be a living saint, and discovers a secret that transforms that intellectual contest into a visceral struggle for his native Scotland.\n\n\n\n\nLymond embarks upon a hunt for the child who may or may not be his, crossing Europe and North Africa following the trail of clues his malevolent adversary has laid for him. Reaching the glittering court of the Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, Lymond must summon all of his courage and willpower to win freedom for himself, his child and his companions.\n\n\n\n\nLymond arrives at the semi-barbaric court of the Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible, and begins the difficult task of transforming this backward country into a modern state. But circumstances may not intend for Lymond to end his days as the Voivoda of all Russia, and he must return to his homeland one last time. There he faces the family he has rejected, and the woman who calls herself his wife.\n\n\n\n\n\"Checkmate\" takes place in 1557, and Francis Crawford of Lymond and Sevigny is once again in France, leading an army against England. But even as he succeeds brilliantly on the battlefield, his haunted past becomes a subject of intense interest to forces on both sides. Meanwhile, Mary Queen of Scots prepares to marry the French Dauphin.\n\n\n\n\nDunnett has not received extended critical attention, but there are some academic studies of her work:\n"}
{"id": "2246050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246050", "title": "Hyperborean cycle", "text": "Hyperborean cycle\n\nThe Hyperborean cycle is a series of short stories by Clark Ashton Smith that take place in the fictional prehistoric setting of Hyperborea. Smith's cycle takes cues from his friends, H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard and their works. Lovecraft wrote to Smith in a letter dated 3 December 1929: \"I must not delay in expressing my well-nigh delirious delight at \"The Tale of Satampra Zeiros\" [Smith's short story]... [W]hat an atmosphere! I can see & feel & smell the jungle around immemorial Commoriom, which I am sure must lie buried today in glacial ice near Olathoe, in the Land of Lomar!\". Soon afterward, Lovecraft included Smith's Tsathoggua (which originally appeared in \"The Tale of Satampra Zeiros\") in the story \"The Mound\", ghostwritten for Zelia Reed (Zelia Bishop) in December 1929. Lovecraft also mentioned Tsathoggua in \"The Whisperer in Darkness\", which he began on February 24, 1930. Because Smith in turn borrowed numerous Lovecraftian elements, the cycle itself may be regarded as a branch of the Cthulhu Mythos. In a letter to August Derleth dated 26 July 1944, Smith wrote: \"In common with other weird tales writers, I have ... made a few passing references (often under slightly altered names, such as Iog-Sotot for Yog-Sothoth and Kthulhut for Cthulhu) to some of the Lovecraftian deities. My Hyperborean tales, it seems to me, with their primordial, prehuman and sometimes premundane background and figures, are the closest to the Cthulhu Mythos, but most of them are written in a vein of grotesque humor that differentiates them vastly. However, such a tale as \"The Coming of the White Worm\" might be regarded as a direct contribution to the Mythos.\".\n\nThe Hyperborean cycle mixes cosmic horror with an Iron Age setting. Adding to the peril is the rapidly approaching ice age, which threatens to wipe out all life on the Hyperborean continent. A host of other deities play important roles in the cycle; foremost is the toad-god Tsathoggua, who dwells in Mount Voormithadreth.\n\nHyperborea is a legendary continent in the Arctic. Before it was overwhelmed by the advancing ice sheets of the Pleistocene age, Hyperborea was a warm and fertile paradise, with lush jungles inhabited by the last remnants of the dinosaurs. A race of yeti-like bipeds, known as the Voormi, once populated Hyperborea, but were wiped out by the pre-human settlers who migrated here from the south. These pre-humans built the first capital of Hyperborea, at Commoriom. Later they moved to Uzuldaroum, when prophesies foretold of Commoriom's doom.\n\n[H]e described a sort of pool with a margin of mud that was marled with obscene offal; and in the pool a grayish, horrid mass that nearly choked it from rim to rim... Here, it seemed, was the ultimate source of all miscreation and abomination. For the gray mass quobbed and quivered, and swelled perpetually; and from it, in manifold fission, were spawned the anatomies that crept away on every side through the grotto. There were things like bodiless legs or arms that flailed in the slime, or heads that rolled, or floundering bellies with fishes' fins; and all manner of things malformed and monstrous, that grew in size as they departed from the neighborhood of Abhoth. And those that swam not swiftly ashore when they fell into the pool from Abhoth, were devoured by mouths that gaped in the parent bulk. \n<br>—Clark Ashton Smith, \"The Seven Geases\"\nAbhoth (\"The Source of Uncleanliness\") resides in the cavern of Y'quaa beneath Mount Voormithadreth. It is a horrid, dark gray protean mass and is said to be the ultimate source of all miscreation and abomination.\n\nObscene monsters constantly form in Abhoth's gray mass and crawl away from their parent. No two of Abhoth's children are alike. In general, they are complex life forms, but the majority of them are simple-minded, acting on impulse. Their forms can be anything from amorphous blobs and singular body parts to queer humanoids and monstrous mutants. Abhoth's tentacles and limbs grab many of them, pulling them back and devouring them. Most of those that escape simply wander off; only a few of them tend to their sire's needs. Abhoth has a twisted and cynical mind and can communicate telepathically with others near him.\n\nAbhoth is also mentioned in Colin Wilson's \"The Mind Parasites\".\n\nAbhoth is one of the Ancient Ones in the board game \"Arkham Horror\". He is included in the Dunwich Horror expansion.\n\nIn the short story \"The Seven Geases\" (1934), Atlach-Nacha is the reluctant recipient of a human sacrifice given to it by the toad-god Tsathoggua. \n\nAtlach-Nacha resembles a huge spider with an almost-human face. It dwells within a huge cavern deep beneath Mount Voormithadreth, a mountain in the now vanished kingdom of Hyperborea in the Arctic. There it spins a gigantic web, bridging a massive chasm between the Dreamlands and the waking world. Some believe that when the web is complete, the end of the world will come, because it will create a permanent junction with the \"Dreamlands\", allowing monsters to move freely into the waking world.\n\nAtlach-Nacha probably came to Earth from the planet Cykranosh (or Saturn as we know it today) with Tsathoggua. Because of its appearance, Atlach-Nacha is often referred to as the \"Spider-God(dess)\" and is believed to be the regent of all spiders. Furthermore, the giant, bloated purple spiders of Leng are thought to be its children and servitors.\n\nThere is some disagreement about its gender. In Smith's original story, Atlach-Nacha is referred to as a male, but in later stories by other authors, it is implied to be a female.\n\nRlim Shaikorth appears as a huge whitish worm with a gaping maw, and eyes made of dripping globules of blood. One of Rlim Shaikorth's avatars is known as the \"White Worm\" and is part of Smith's Hyperborean cycle.\n\nThe White Worm travels on a gigantic iceberg called \"Yikilth\", which it can guide across the ocean. In its colossal ice-citadel, the White Worm prowls the seas, blasting ships and inhabited land masses with extreme cold. Victims of the White Worm are frozen solid, their bodies appearing eerily white, and remain preternaturally cold—they will not melt nor warm even when exposed to fire. (\"The Coming of the White Worm\", 1941)\n\nSee Tsathoggua.\n\nThere, in the grey beginning of Earth, the formless mass that was Ubbo-Sathla reposed amid the slime and the vapors. Headless, without organs or members, it sloughed from its oozy sides, in a slow, ceaseless wave, the amoebic forms that were the archetypes of earthly life. Horrible it was, if there had been aught to apprehend the horror; and loathsome, if there had been any to feel loathing. About it, prone or tilted in the mire, there lay the mighty tablets of star-quarried stone that were writ with the inconceivable wisdom of the pre-mundane gods.\n<br>—Clark Ashton Smith, \"Ubbo-Sathla\"\nUbbo-Sathla (\"The Unbegotten Source\", \"The Demiurge\") is described as a huge protoplasmic mass resting in a grotto deep beneath the frozen earth. The being is of a monstrous fecundity, spontaneously generating primordial single-celled organisms that pour unceasingly from its shapeless form. It guards a set of stone tablets believed to contain the knowledge of the Elder Gods.\n\nUbbo-Sathla is said to have spawned the prototypes of all forms of life on Earth, though whatever its pseudopods touch is forever devoid of life. Ubbo-Sathla is destined to someday reabsorb all living things on Earth.\n\nUbbo-Sathla possibly dwells in gray-litten Y'qaa. The being may also dwell in Mount Voormithadreth and may have spawned another of its residents, the being Abhoth, whose form and nature is very similar. This similarity has led some writers to speculate that Ubbo-Sathla and Abhoth are the same entity viewed at different epochs under different names. The tablets that Ubbo-Sathla guards have been oft sought by sorcerers, though no sorcerer has yet succeeded in acquiring them.\n\nIn Smith's \"The Door to Saturn\", Yhoundeh the elk-goddess is the name of the deity worshipped in the waning days of Hyperborea. Yhoundeh's priests also banned Tsathoggua's cult, and her inquisitors punished any heretics. As the Hyperborean civilization drew to a close, Yhoundeh's priests fell out of favor and the people returned to the worship of Tsathoggua.\n\nAccording to the Parchments of Pnom, Yhoundeh is the wife of Nyarlathotep, messenger of the Outer Gods.\n\nCommoriom was the first seat of power in Hyperborea, established by the pre-Human migrants from the south. In its heyday, Commoriom was a grand city, built of marble and granite and marked by a skyline of altitudinous spires.\n\nLegend has it that the populace fled Commoriom when the White Sybil of Polarion foretold of its destruction. However, Athammaus, headsman of Commoriom, disputes this claim and attributes the abandonment to the increasingly loathsome depredations of the horrid outlaw Knygathin Zhaum.\n\nAccording to Smith's \"The Tale of Satampra Zeiros\", Uzuldaroum became the capital of Hyperborea after the populace left Commoriom. The city lies a day's journey from the former capital. It was the last population center in Hyperborea before glaciers overwhelmed the continent.\n\nIn H. P. Lovecraft's \"At the Mountains of Madness\", the city of the Elder Things is called \"a Palaeogaean megalopolis compared with which the fabled...Commoriom and Uzuldaroum...are recent things of today--not even of yesterday\".\n\nThe Eiglophian mountains, mentioned in Smith's \"The Seven Geases\", are a terrifying range of ebon peaks, said to be \"glassy-walled\", and are believed to be honeycombed with hidden tunnels. The Eiglophian mountains cross the middle of the Hyperborean continent, with one range stretching to the south and another to the east.\n\nMhu Thulan was a province in northern Hyperborea famous for its sorcerers. It was where the wizard Eibon dwelled, as well as many other notable sorcerers of hyperborea, such as Zon Mezzamalech.\n\nMount Voormithadreth is a four-coned extinct volcano and is the tallest peak in the Eiglophian mountains. It is the dwelling place of various horrors, including the toad-god Tsathoggua and the spider-god Atlach-Nacha.\n\nThe gray-litten cavern of Y'quaa is the dwelling place of Abhoth, the Source of Uncleanliness. It is indirectly connected with the Cavern of Archetypes. Atlach-Nacha originated here. Y'quaa might be the true home of the enigmatic Ubbo-Sathla.\n\nThe Cavern of the Archetypes is a vast cavern inhabited by the spectral archetypes of all life on this earth. Nug and Yeb reside here.\n\nPolarion was a region of northern Hyperborea, separated from the rest of the continent by an unnamed mountain range. It used to be a fertile place, but was later overtaken by glaciers. The White Sybil is said to originate from here.\n\nThe Voormis are the three-toed, umber-colored, fur-covered humanoids that once had a thriving civilization in Hyperborea. They dwelled underground and worshiped the god Tsathoggua. After most were wiped out by other pre-human settlers, the most savage of the Voormis became restricted to caves in the upper slopes of the Eiglophian mountains. Before Hyperborea's fall, the remaining Voormis were hunted for sport.\n\nThe Gnophkehs are humanoid cannibals who were once residents of Hyperborea before being driven to Lomar by the Voormis. They were driven into exile into the frigid wastes of Polarion where they were later invaded by the people from Zobna. They are described as being covered in coarse, matted hair with large protruding ears and proboscidean noses. They worshiped the Great Old One Rhan-Tegoth and Ithaqua.\n\nAthammaus, who appears in Smith's \"The Testament of Athammaus\", was the headsman, or executioner, of Commoriom before its downfall. He was also one of the last to leave the city when the population fled to Uzuldaroum. Afterwards, he recorded a chilling testament of Commoriom's final days.\n\nAthammaus was descended from a long line of headsmen. A consummate professional, Athammaus always took great pride in his skill and never shirked his official duty. His career suffered in Commoriom when he faced the task of executing the outlaw Knygathin Zhaum, but he later resumed it in Uzuldaroum where he served 11 lusters .\n\nEibon, a character in Smith's \"The Door to Saturn\", was a sorcerer and priest of Zhothaqquah (Tsathoggua). He is renowned as the writer of the \"Book of Eibon\", a tome that, among other things, chronicles Eibon's life, and includes his magical formulae and rites of Zhothaqquah (it is introduced in Smith's tale \"Ubbo-Sathla\"). Eibon lived in a five-story, five-sided tower made of black gneiss that stood beside the sea on Mhu Thulan. Eibon disappeared shortly after Yhoundeh's premier inquisitor, Morghi, came to his black tower with a writ for his arrest.\n\nWhen the inquisition came knocking, Eibon fled to Cykranosh (the planet Saturn) through a magic panel given to him by Zhothaqquah. Eibon was never again seen on Earth after that. (When Morghi vanished close on the heels of Eibon, many believed that he was in league with the sorcerer all along and so is largely responsible for the decline in the worship of Yhoundeh.)\n\nKnygathin Zhaum was a notorious outlaw of Hyperborea. He was the child of Sfatlicllp and a Voormi.\n\nHe repopulated Hyperborea after humans deserted the cities of Uzuldaroum and Commoriom. Athammaus tried to execute him by beheading, but because of his preternatural heritage, such attempts proved unsuccessful and only served to aggravate him. As a descendant of Cxaxukluth, Knygathin Zhaum reproduced by fission and thus created an Azathothian strain among the Hyperborean Voormi.\n\nSatampra Zeiros, who appears in Smith's \"The Tale of Satampra Zeiros\" and its prequel, \"The Theft of the Thirty-Nine Girdles\", was the master thief of Uzuldaroum. His exploits are legendary. He lost his right hand during a failed venture to loot the deserted city of Commoriom (though his companion Tirouv Ompallios suffered a worse fate).\n\nA strange woman, reportedly coming from the realms of ice creeping upon Hyperborea. She is presented in both \"The Tale of Satampra Zeiros\" and \"The White Sybil.\" In the former, she is portrayed prophesizing the doom of Commoriom; in the latter, a character besotted with her pursues her into the ice realm, where he is in the end so blinded by her vision that when found by a common girl he takes his rescuer for the Sybil, weds her, and lives out his days in a joyous illusion, bearing the mark of the Sybil's kiss on his face.\n\n\nThe following short stories are considered part of Smith's \"Hyperborean cycle\":\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2246051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246051", "title": "Mensalão scandal", "text": "Mensalão scandal\n\nThe Mensalão scandal (, ) was a vote-buying scandal that threatened to bring down the government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2005. \"Mensalão\" is a neologism, a variant of the word for \"big monthly payment\" (\"salário mensal\" or \"mensalidade\").\n\nThe scandal broke on June 6, 2005 when Brazilian deputy Roberto Jefferson told the \"Folha de S.Paulo\" newspaper that the ruling Workers' Party (PT) had paid a number of deputies 30,000 reais (around US$12,000 at the time) a month to vote for legislation favored by the ruling party. The funds allegedly came from state-owned companies' advertising budgets, funneled through an advertising agency owned by Marcos Valério.\n\nThe investigation then implicated members of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, DEM, Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and seven other political parties also involved. Many key advisers to Lula resigned, and several deputies were faced with the choice of resignation or expulsion from congress. The president himself went on to be re-elected in 2006, and in 2010 Brazil elected his chief of staff, Dilma Rousseff, as president. Much of PT's leadership was affected in some way, with many resigning or failing to win re-election. Brazil's economy was widely perceived as not having been substantially impacted by the scandal.\n\nRoberto Jefferson, who initially sparked the scandal, was expelled from the Chamber of Deputies on September 14, 2005 for ethical violations determined by the Congressional Council of Ethics. Despite continued additional resignations, in October the scandal died down somewhat as Brazil held a contentious referendum on a banning gun sales, an initiative soundly rejected by voters.\n\nWhen Lula was elected in 2003, his party held less than 20% of the seats in the Assembly. He put together a coalition of twelve parties, but since his appointees were primarily from his own party, the payments were intended to assure the continued support of other members of the coalition government.\n\nOn September 18, 2004 Brazilian weekly magazine \"Veja\" printed a cover story entitled \"Scandal: PT's buyout of PTB\". The article described an alliance between the Workers Party (PT) and the Brazilian Labour Party (PTB). According to \"Veja\", PT promised to pay R$150,000 to each PTB deputy if they would support the executive branch . Allegedly because these promises were not kept, a storm of corruption allegations against PT began in May 2005.\n\nOn September 24, 2004, the Rio de Janeiro newspaper \"Jornal do Brasil\" published an article citing \"Veja\" which also said that former Minister of Communications Miro Teixeira had revealed the monthly payments to the Ministry of Public Prosecution.\n\n\"Jornal do Brasil\" then published another story saying that the president of the Chamber of Deputies João Paulo Cunha (PT) promised to fully investigate the claims and quoted president of the Popular Socialist Party (Brazil) Roberto Freire saying: \"This subject has been circulating for months in Congress but nobody has the courage to approach it.\"\n\nOn May 14, 2005, \"Veja\" published a new story describing an apparent corruption scheme in the Brazilian Postal Service, describing a 110-minute video recording, made with a hidden camera, that showed former Post Office Chief apparently receiving a bribe from a businessman. The full bribery scheme involving government contracts was allegedly administered by Post Office administrative director Antônio Osório Batista and by Jefferson, a Post Office manager as well as a federal deputy. On the tape, aired by the major Brazilian television stations, Marinho receives, then pockets, R$3,000 (about $1,259 US) in cash.\n\nAgents from the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (ABIN) investigated. As the scandal developed, it was argued that this was linked to an attempt to destroy PT's former allies without the scandal exploding upon the government. However, a major political battle began when the government tried to systematically obstruct the creation of a Parliamentary Commission of Investigation (CPI) to investigate the growing corruption scandal.\n\nOn June 3, 2005 the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo published a story saying that the government was tying funds for various projects to support for the creation of the CPI. Because of these allegations, part of the government's base joined the opposition to support the creation of a Parliamentary Commission of Investigation. Abandoned by his allies, Jefferson began to counterattack. On June 6, \"Folha de S.Paulo\" published an interview with Jefferson claiming that Delúbio Soares, treasurer of the Workers' Party, made monthly payments of R$30,000 to certain Congressional deputies, to influence them to vote with the government. Jefferson said that those who received the monthly payment called it mensalão, derived from the Portuguese word for a monthly payment. \"Mensalão\" quickly became the adopted popular label for the scandal, now identified as the \"escândalo do mensalão.\"\n\nAccording to Jefferson, businessman Marcos Valério, owner of the advertising agencies and DNA, which had large government contracts, operated the scheme. After the investigative commission was set up, the government allegedly tried to control it by installing government allies Senator Delcídio do Amaral (PT) as president of the commission and Deputy Osmar Serraglio (PMDB) as the key \"rapporteur\", responsible for writing the final report.\n\nAlthough the investigation of the Post Office scandal was officially restricted in scope to irregularities in the Post Office's administration, it began to investigate the expanding monthly payment claims because of apparent connections between the cases. An additional commission was created to investigate the broader scandal on July 20. Allies of the government occupied key posts. The president of the CPI was Senator and the \"rapporteur\" was Deputy Ibrahim Abi-Ackel. Abi-Ackel had been minister of justice in the government of João Baptista Figueiredo, and had also been accused of involvement in the corruption scandal.\n\nJosé Dirceu, once a leftist student leader who organized against the right-wing military dictatorship after it took power in a 1964 coup, was arrested in 1968, then released at the demand of the kidnappers of the US ambassador. He was exiled to Cuba. Later, he secretly returned to Brazil, under a false identity and had plastic surgery to disguise his face. He hid in Paraná and opened a shop. During this time, he became involved as a student union leader. He married but did not reveal his true identity even after he had a son with his wife. Only after 1979, when political amnesty was declared, did he openly return to political life, campaigning for democratic elections and the end of the dictatorship regime.\n\nAs a consequence of the \"mensalão scandal\", Dirceu resigned in 2005 as chief of staff to President Lula.\n\nIn early July 2005, an advisor to a Congressional deputy and brother of Workers’ Party President José Genoíno, was stopped at an airport with $100,000 in his underwear and additional funds in his luggage. The wives and secretaries of key figures testified before numerous and overlapping Congressional panels, including Valério's secretary, , and the ex-wife of Valdemar Costa Neto, Maria Christina Mendes Caldeira, who later fled to the United States with nothing but her clothes and a support animal. She applied for asylum under a secret identity.\n\nCongressional hearings were often marked by fiery rhetoric and emotional outbursts, including numerous incidents of crying by witnesses and Workers' Party deputies. Although still murky and unclear, reported links between the scandal, its key figures, the murder of Santo André's mayor Celso Daniel and various mafia and criminal figures only intensified its sensational tone and societal impact. One key event that broadened the scandal into a more general investigation of the Workers' Party history as whole was the testimony of Duda Mendonça, public relations specialist and campaign manager for Lula's 2002 campaign, on August 11. He said he was paid using off-shore bank accounts and possibly illegal funds connected to Valério.\n\nThe scandal, which had at that time not yet involved finance minister Antonio Palocci, said to be popular with the international finance community, threatened his standing after lawyer and former advisor testified that Palocci was involved in corrupt activities while he was mayor of Ribeirão Preto in the mid-1990s.\n\nLula's popularity waxed and waned, but no definite proof emerged that he orchestrated or had knowledge of the payments. Much of PT's leadership was affected in some way, with many resigning or failing to win re-election. Brazil's economy was widely perceived as not having been substantially impacted by the scandal.\n\nRoberto Jefferson, who initially sparked the scandal, was expelled from the Chamber of Deputies on September 14, 2005 after the Congressional Council of Ethics determined that he had committed ethical violations. Despite continued resignations of those implicated, in October the scandal died down somewhat and Brazil had a referendum on gun sales that resulted in a loss for the government's position. At the end of October, \"Veja\" published a new story claiming that the Workers' Party had received illegal campaign funds from Cuba—threatening to re-intensify the scandal once again, though that was not ultimately the case.\n\nThe investigations into Post Office corruption and vote-buying unanimously approved their first joint preliminary report on September 1, 2005.\n\nThe report accused 18 Brazilian deputies of involvement in the corruption scandal:\n\nThe report accused them of misdeeds ranging from illegal campaign finance activity, placing cronies in strategic positions in government-owned businesses in return for kickbacks, to taking cash payments for voting with the government in the Brazilian Congress.\n\nThe report states that as to the charges initially made by deputy Roberto Jefferson (PTB):\n\nThe report added that several documents had been identified and validated which proved that large sums of money were withdrawn from agencies of the Rural Bank in Brasilia and Belo Horizonte, as well as from the bank accounts of the enterprises and DNA. According to the documents, the beneficiaries were federal deputies who received funds in person or through relatives, advisers, or individuals chosen by Marcos Valério. Some payments were made monthly, and others either more or less frequently. \nThe report called the defense made by some parliamentarians that the funds were used to settle debts from electoral campaigns a \"lame excuse\".\n\nThe following CPIs were involved in investigating issues related to the cash-for-votes scandal.\n\n\nMembers of the opposition also wanted a fourth CPI to investigate off-book accounts held by all parties during the most recent elections. Due to serial allegations of this kind of operation in many campaigns in 2002, including President Lula's, many believed this CPI could result in a legal and concrete reason to start his impeachment process. However this process was aborted.\n\nThe Council of Ethics and Parliamentary Decorum of the House is responsible for processing and disciplining members for behavior not in concordance with parliamentary decorum.\n\nTo expel a deputy, 257 votes out of 513 are needed. Expelled deputies lose their seats and also their parliamentary privileges and immunity. Members can also be barred from holding public office for eight years. Jefferson for example cannot run for office again until 2015.\n\nOn August 24, 2007, the Supreme Federal Court, responsible for criminal proceedings against parliamentarians due to parliamentary immunity, accepted the indictments of 40 individuals related to the Mensalão scandal, most of them former or current federal deputies, and all of whom were or are allies of former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\nThe trial began in August 2012.\n\nIn the first 23 sessions of the trial the Supreme Court found that misuse of public money and bank loans did occur. Ten of the 37 defendants received sentences, including Marcos Valério, a ringleader. Three were acquitted.\n\nOn 15 September 2012 \"Veja\" published a new story alleging that Valério had told friends that former president Lula masterminded the corruption scheme. José Dirceu's allies called this a lie and said Valério was out of his head and desperate, a convict facing prison.\n\nOn September 17 the court began to examine the primary accusation, which included allegations that Dirceu led of the vote-buying scheme which laundered and then disbursed millions in public and private money to secure votes in Congress from 2003 to 2005. The \"rapporteur\" found clear evidence that such activities occurred, saying \"there is no doubt that this scheme existed.\"\n\nOn 9 October 2012, the court found Dirceu, José Genoino and Delúbio Soares guilty of bribery (\"Corrupção Ativa\"). On 15 November 2013 the STF president ordered them imprisoned. This coincided with the anniversary of the proclamation of the Republic so there was much debate about Barbosa's reasons for waiting until then. Some days later Genoino was transferred to house arrest out of concerns about his health.\n\nDocuments from the Conselho de Controle de Atividades Financeiras (COAF) indicate that between July and May 2003, withdrawals of 27 million reais were made from the accounts of businessman Marcos Valério.\n\nAccording to deputy Roberto Jefferson, the money for the mensalão came from Banco Rural and the Banco do Brasil. Documents from COAF validate the withdrawals from Banco Rural; the withdrawals from the Banco do Brasil have not yet been traced.\n\nThe table below shows a side-by-side description of some of the withdrawals and allegedly connected votes in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies.\nSource:\"Reuters\".\n\n\nThe following members of other parties that gave political support to the Workers' Party before the scandal: PTB, PP, PL, and the PMDB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2246060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246060", "title": "LB&amp;SCR A1 class", "text": "LB&amp;SCR A1 class\n\nThe London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR) A1 Class is an English class of 0-6-0T steam locomotive. Designed by William Stroudley, 50 members of the class were built in 1872 and between 1874 and 1880, all at Brighton Works. The class has received several nicknames, initially being known as \"Rooters\" by their south London crews. However, the engines were more famously known as \"Terriers\" on account of the distinctive 'bark' of the exhaust beat. Later in their careers, some engines were known as \"Hayling Billy\" on account of their work on the Hayling Island branch line. A pub of this name on the island was briefly home to the engine which is now No.W8 \"Freshwater\".\n\nAfter displacement from their original workings out of London Bridge and London Victoria by more powerful locomotives from the D class and the early stages of the LB&SCR overhead electrification scheme, some representatives of the class were sold to other operators, while the majority of the remainder were put to work on branch lines in Sussex and on non-revenue earning work such as shunting.\n\nWith these new uses being found, the class remained in use on the system, surviving to be taken into ownership by the Southern Railway from 1923 and by British Railways from 1948. Although the number of engines dwindled following the Second World War as the work they were used for was either dieselised or lost to rail through the closure of branch lines and yards, a number continued in operation through into the 1960s, most famously on the Hayling Island Branch Line in Hampshire. The withdrawal of the final members of the class finally came in 1963, the line to Hayling having closed in November 1963.\n\nEight members of the class were purchased privately for preservation, with two other examples being donated by British Railways to the Canadian Railway Museum and the National Railway Museum. One of these engines, No.55 \"Stepney\", is best known as being the first locomotive to arrive at the Bluebell Railway, which was itself the first preserved standard gauge steam-operated passenger railway in the world when it opened in August 1960, and also for appearing in \"Stepney the \"Bluebell\" Engine\", one of the books in the original Railway Series written by the Reverend W. Awdry which also gave birth to Thomas the Tank Engine.\n\nOriginally known as 'A' class, these diminutive tank locomotives were designed in 1870 to haul commuter trains on the heavily congested lines in South and South-East London. These included routes from London Bridge to both East and West Croydon, London Victoria to Sutton and the line from Victoria to London Bridge via Peckham Rye and Denmark Hill, as well as operating on the East London Railway under the Thames through the Thames Tunnel designed by Marc Isambard Brunel. Six locomotives were built for these services during 1872, and were successful thanks to their high acceleration between the closely spaced station stops and the use of lightweight trains. A further 44 were built between June 1874 and September 1880 to complement the original six.\n\nThe locomotives were finished in the livery known as \"Stroudley's Improved Engine Green\", which was actually an ochre colour, not green. This is historically attributed to colour-blindness, an affliction from which Stroudley reportedly suffered. The actual shade of the livery has been much disputed, with opinions ranging from a more yellow type of livery to a livery closer to brown, as worn by the model named \"Como\" in the Brighton Toy and Model Museum.\n\nShortly after construction, No.40 \"Brighton\" was chosen by William Stroudley to represent the LB&SCR at the Paris Exhibition of 1878, and won a gold medal for workmanship. On a run from Dieppe to Paris, arranged to persuade the Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest that the company's boat trains that met the LB&SCR ferries from Newhaven could make better time to the capital, \"Brighton\" maintained a speed of nearly 50 mph, previously unheard of on that line.\n\nDuring the last two decades of the 19th century, London was expanding outwards as suburbs became more built up and were absorbed into the built-up area of London itself. Towns such as Croydon, Sutton and Norwood, which had previously been commuter towns separate from London, grew to form one large area of housing. Much of this was because of the success of the 'Terriers' themselves, as they had speeded up suburban passenger services, encouraging people to move out of the centre of London. Trains became progressively heavier while the need for shorter journey times remained the same. As a result, the engines gradually became largely unsuited for their original purpose, and they were replaced by the larger D class tank engines. However the 'Terriers' were so reliable that they were put on other work, often finding use on branch line passenger and freight workings and as shunting engines.\n\nTwenty-three members of the class were withdrawn between 1898 and 1905, but the majority of these were sold in working order rather than scrapped. Purchasers of these locomotives included the Newhaven Harbour Company, the Isle of Wight Central Railway (four locomotives), Pauling & Co. (five locomotives), the Kent and East Sussex Railway (two locomotives), the London and South Western Railway (two locomotives), and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. Others were transferred from capital to departmental (non-revenue earning) stock as pilots at Brighton locomotive works and Lancing carriage works. It is likely that the remainder of the class would have been withdrawn over the subsequent few years if the railway had not adopted push-pull or 'motor-train' working on many lightly used branch line services. The 'A1' class (as the locomotives were designated after 1905) were found ideally suited for conversion to this form of working.\n\nBetween 1911 and 1913 twelve survivors were re-boilered under the instruction of Douglas Earle Marsh, Stroudley's successor as CME of the LB&SCR, with another four so treated after the Great War; these engines formed the A1X Class with an increased weight of . Other changes made during the rebuilding were the extension of the smokebox (removing the smokebox 'wings', and moving the sandboxes from this same area (where they formed a forward extension of the leading driving wheel splasher) to below the running plate (although some locos rebuilt later retained the original sandboxes). The tube which had been used as part of the original condensing arrangement between the smokebox and side-tank was also removed. The engines were repainted during this time in 'Marsh Umber' livery.\n\nFive locomotives were bought by the British Government in 1918 and sent to Scotland to work at the U.S. Navy's North Sea Mine Barrage minelaying project at Inverness and Dalmore, near Invergordon. The facilities were built by the Admiralty, using distillery sites, but administered by the U.S. Navy.\nThe locos were Nos 37, Southdown; 79, Minories; 81, Beulah; 83, Earlswood at Dalmore and 38, Millwall which was used at Glen Albyn, Inverness. Nos 38, 81 and 83 later went on to the Shropshire & Montgomeryshire Railway.\n\nFifteen of the class remained in LB&SCR stock at the formation of the Southern Railway on 1 January 1923, but this figure was increased to 24 by the inclusion of those which had previously been sold to other constituent railways. Several examples were withdrawn over the next few years, and two were sold to the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Railway in 1925 and 1937. As with the withdrawals under the LB&SCR, the engines were not withdrawn en masse, but instead over a long period of time. The first A1X to be withdrawn by the Southern Railway was No.42 \"Tulse Hill\" in 1925, and among the engines withdrawn was the now-famous No.55 \"Stepney\", which only escaped being scrapped by virtue of the need for lighter engines on Hayling Island. The two locomotives, No.43 \"Gipsy Hill\" and No.53 \"Ashtead\", sold to the WCPR in 1925 and 1937 (see above) were renumbered No.2 \"Portishead\" and No.4 respectively. On the closure of that line in 1940, both locomotives entered service with the GWR, as No.5 \"Portishead\" and No.6 respectively, and survived into BR ownership. No.5 \"Portishead\" was scrapped in 1954, No.6 in 1948.\n\nMany of the locomotives remained in traffic, both departmental and in regular stock. They lasted longer than most classes of pre-grouping tank engine under the Southern Railway, primarily due to the presence of several light railways which came under the Southern Railway's jurisdiction at the grouping, such as the lines from Tenterden and Hayling Island, as well as on the Isle of Wight. Most of these lines needed small engines such as the 'Terrier' class due to severe weight restrictions. Among the engines transferred into departmental use was the former No.82 \"Boxhill\", which was restored to original condition, painted in the yellow ochre livery of Stroudley and used as a shunter at Brighton Works, being numbered 380S and named after the works itself. This engine was replaced by 377S, formerly No.35 \"Morden\", in 1948. Although much photographed toward the end of steam, this locomotive was not preserved but was scrapped at Eastleigh in 1963.\n\nWith the Southern Railway concentrating on the design of larger locomotives for the increasingly heavy express passenger traffic on the South Eastern and South Western sections, with designs such as the King Arthur, Schools and Lord Nelson classes, and later the Bulleid Pacifics, as well as the expansion of the electrified third rail system from suburban roles (a system which had replaced the LB&SCR overhead electrification, which in turn had replaced the role of the D class tanks on suburban traffic from around 1910), the company was not concerned about replacing the veteran tank engines on branch line workings, especially as many of the smaller branch lines were not economically viable for electrification, or were isolated from the rest of the electrified network. As a result, the Southern Railway felt that perseverance with the older locomotives such as the A1X on rural routes was the most economically viable option.\n\nAt nationalisation in 1948, one \"A1\" and 14 \"A1X\" locomotives entered British Railways stock. All but one of these locomotives were based on the former Southern Railway, which became the Southern Region under British Railways, with the other based on the Western Region, having been inherited by the Great Western Railway from the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Railway. BR gave the locomotives the power classification 0P, indicating that the locomotives were primarily passenger locomotives, but were among the least powerful on the system.\n\nThe locomotives remained employed much as they had been under Southern Railway ownership, with roles centred on working over the lightly laid and weight restricted branches. However, the class were becoming increasingly expensive to maintain through physical wear and increased age of components. The future of the class was thrown into doubt with the publication of the Modernisation Plan, which made provision to close many of the routes still operated by the class. The main two routes still retaining 'Terrier' operations were the Kent & East Sussex Railway and the Hayling Island branch. The former closed due to being unprofitable in 1961.\n\nThe line to Hayling Island remained profitable, however, primarily due to the heavy traffic in summer. The condition of the bridge over Langstone Harbour was, however, deteriorating, and the Southern Region designated the bridge as being beyond economic repair. The final scheduled services over the line were run on 3 November 1963, and a special 'topped and tailed' by 32636 and 32670 the following day. The final scheduled train was notable for being one of the last steam hauled mixed trains. With the closure of this line, BR decided to withdraw the last remaining members of the class from traffic. At the time of her withdrawal following the closure of the line, No.32636 (formerly 72 \"Fenchurch\") was the oldest working steam engine in British Railways ownership. The final operational A1X with BR was No.32678, which remained in service from Brighton shed until 10 August 1963.\n\nThe locomotives were originally numbered between 35 and 84, and most were given names of London boroughs or other areas of local importance which were served by the LB&SCR suburban trains they were built to operate (such as \"Whitechapel\", \"Surrey\" and \"Thames\"), and indeed also after areas around Brighton itself, such as Kemp Town. However, there were exceptions, such as No.82 which was, in fact, named after Box Hill, a peak of the North Downs in Surrey, just outside Dorking.\n\nFrom 1900, the two-digit numbers were prefixed with a 6 and their names were replaced with the inscription LBSC on their side tanks (for example, No.55 \"Stepney\" became No.655). This was fairly standard LB&SCR practice; as engines got old, they were given higher numbers so that newer engines could have lower numbers.\n\nFurther renumbering took place under Southern Railway ownership. Initially, most locomotives retained their pre-Grouping numbers with a letter prefix denoting the main works that was responsible for maintaining the class. Ex-LBSC locomotives, being maintained at Brighton, received B prefixes, thus engine No.654 became B654). The exceptions to this rule were the engines based on the Isle of Wight, which were given a \"W\" prefix. In 1930 this system was replaced by a new numbering scheme, whereby former LB&SCR engines had their numbers increased by 2000. Under this scheme, No. B654 became No.2654.\n\nA final renumbering in British Railways ownership saw the remaining members of the class renumbered by the addition of 30,000 to their Southern Railway numbers (2678 becoming 32678, for instance), in line with the national renumbering scheme drawn up by British Railways in 1948.\n\nThe famous Brighton Works shunting engine 377S (i.e. no. 377 in Service stock), by this stage the only member of the class not in revenue earning service, became DS377 (the \"DS\" standing for Departmental, Southern region).\n\nTen members of the class have been preserved, chiefly in the South of England. The engines are listed in order of their LB&SCR identity; the identity in bold is their current running identity as of January 2010.\n\n\nAs of November 2019, two Terriers are in operation. In the UK, steam locomotives may only be run for 10 years at a time between major overhauls (boiler certificates), and as such only engines which have been returned to traffic within the last ten years are classed as \"operational\". These engines are \"Newport\" (able to run until 2024)., and \"Martello\" (able to run until 2026). 72 \"Fenchurch's\" boiler certificate expired in February 2011, and 55 \"Stepney\" was withdrawn ahead of its certificate expiration in March 2014. No. 50 \"Whitechapel\"/Sutton, is currently being restored at the Spa Valley Railway. \"Knowle\", \"Bodiam\" and \"Freshwater\" are all dismantled for ten-yearly overhauls.\n\nNo.55 \"Stepney\" (as no. 32655) was the first engine to arrive at the first standard gauge preserved line in the UK, the Bluebell Railway on 17 May 1960, effectively making it the doyen of the current heritage railway movement. Following purchase by the fledgling society the locomotive was run under its own steam from Brighton shed to Horsted Keynes hauling the two carriages the society also now owned. The locomotive then went on to haul the reopening train in August of that year.\n\nNo.72 \"Fenchurch\" was purchased by the Bluebell Railway in 1964. After much initial use, the locomotive was retired for overhaul in 1970, and returned to traffic in 1972 for its centenary. However, it was withdrawn in 1975, and with a new firebox re-entered service in 1980, running until 1988. At its next overhaul, the need to replace one pair of the original wrought iron wheels due to the detection of cracks in a wheel-hub meant the locomotive was not returned to traffic until 2001. Although carrying an A1X boiler, the smokebox was rebuilt during that overhaul such that it now looks very similar to its original A1 form.\n\nAn equally famous member of the class to No.55, arguably, is No.82 \"Boxhill\". The engine was restored by the Southern Railway to original condition (it had remained as an A1, not having been rebuilt as an A1X) and used at exhibitions, before being moved into the original British Transport Museum in Clapham. It was subsequently moved to the museum at York where it still resides.\n\nAlso preserved in a national museum, No.54 \"Waddon\" was donated by British Rail to the Canadian railway museum in 1963 and was shipped on 23 August that year. After a number of years in storage but never outdoors, three British ex-pats living in Ottawa formed a small group to work on the locomotive and restore it to pristine condition. Waddon was not rebuilt as an A1X, having been fitted with an SECR boiler after being sold to that railway, but was later fitted with, and now carries an A1X boiler, whilst retaining the shorter A1-type smokebox.\n\nThree members of the class were sold by British Rail to Butlins for display at their holiday camps. No.40 \"Brighton\" (now \"Newport\") was sent to Butlins Pwllheli in 1964 and initially loaned to the Isle of Wight steam railway in 1972. It was sold to them four years later for a price of £35,000. A lengthy restoration was completed in 1989, and Newport continued to run until 2002 when withdrawn for overhaul. The locomotive's boiler was found to be life-expired, and it was found cheaper to order a new boiler made (for £70,000) in 2007. In October 2010, the new boiler was delivered.\n\nNo.62 \"Martello\" went to Butlins Heads-of-Ayr camp in 1963, and was displayed alongside 46233 \"Duchess of Sutherland\" before being loaned, and then sold to the museum at Bressingham. The locomotive remained there for several years in a shed before removal and full restoration, which commenced in the late 1990s. In her Marsh Umber livery numbered 662 with LBSC on her tanks, she has visited several heritage railways in the UK since being returned to traffic. In May 2011 she was repainted in BR black as 32662 with the late BR logo, at Loughborough on the Great Central in readiness to join 32670 and 32678 on the K&ESR for the \"Last Train Commemoration\" that took place on 11 June 2011.\n\nNo.78 \"Knowle\" went to Butlins Minehead camp and was displayed alongside 46229 \"Duchess of Hamilton\" before being purchased by the K&ESR in 1975. This locomotive is now owned by The Terrier Trust.\n\nAlso owned by this society is No.70 \"Poplar\" (usually running as K&ESR No.3 \"Bodiam\"), which was initially purchased by the Wheels brothers of Brighton in 1964 from BR, and was used in the early years of operation on the original Kent and East Sussex Light Railway as well as on the same restored heritage railway. Following withdrawal in 1985, the engine remained out of use for a decade before the K&ESR and The Terrier Trust bought the locomotive and agreed a restoration plan. She returned to traffic in May 2006 at the \"All Terriers Great and Small\" Gala in her original Rother Valley Railway livery of Oxford Blue, then in April 2011 was repainted BR black as 32670 with the late BR logo, to feature at the \"Last Train Commemoration\" that took place on 11 June 2011. Both of the Terriers continue to be regular performers on the K&ESR; the short trains and light loading gauge making them ideally suited to operating on the line.\n\nNo. 50 \"Whitechapel\" was purchased by Municipal Borough of Sutton and Cheam in 1963 (after the originally intended purchase, No.61 \"Sutton\", had been cut up). The intention was to display the engine outside the new Civic Centre, and the engine was offered a home on the K&ESR until the work was completed. The engine was restored and used to haul the opening train on the preserved K&ESR in 1974. After slipping down the overhaul queue at Rolvenden, the engine was moved to the Spa Valley Railway by the owners (the engine still being owned by Sutton Borough Council) and restoration work commenced.\n\nNo.46 \"Newington\" has perhaps the most unusual history. Following withdrawal in 1963, the locomotive was sold to the Sadler Rail Coach company based at Droxford, Hampshire on the disused Meon Valley Railway. It was used on occasion between the Droxford and Wickham stations on that line. Subsequently, it was sold to the Portsmouth-based Brickwoods brewery in the Spring of 1966. The brewery wanted to purchase it for use outside a new public house to be opened on Hayling Island named \"The Hayling Billy\". The engine was displayed there for a number of years, becoming locally famous, before being donated to the Isle of Wight Steam Railway in 1979.\n\nNone of the preserved members of the class have been restored to full main line running condition. However, some consideration was given to doing so during the restoration of No.62 \"Martello\" in the early years of the 21st century, in order to facilitate the appearance of the engine at open days and exhibitions in an operational condition. However, the costs involved led to the idea being abandoned.\n\nPrior to the end of steam and the banning of steam engines from the national network in 1968, No.55 \"Stepney\" worked two special trains over the metals of the Southern Region. The first trip ran on 21 October 1962 and saw No.55 doublehead with LSWR Adams radial tank No.488 on the Haywards Heath to Horsted Keynes and return section of a rail tour from London Victoria to the Bluebell Railway. The second train ran from Brighton to Horsted Keynes on 27 October 1963 for members of the Bluebell Railway Preservation Society, which saw the locomotive double-head with another former LB&SCR locomotive, E4 No.473 \"Birch Grove\", and was run to mark the closure of the line from Haywards Heath to Horsted Keynes.\nNo.55 returned to Brighton station in 1991 to mark the 150th anniversary of the opening of the London and Brighton Railway to Brighton. The locomotive was left 'cold' (i.e. not in steam) and was coupled to another ex-LB&SCR locomotive, \"Gladstone\", and stabled during the day on the eastern-most platform (number 9). The engines were the centre-piece of an exhibition which also included, among others, former Southern Railway 'King Arthur' No.777 \"Sir Lamiel\", Britannia class No.70000 \"Britannia\" and BR Standard 4MT No.80072, a class of locomotive built at Brighton.\n\nIn August 1975, No.72 \"Fenchurch\" represented the LB&SCR and the Bluebell Railway at the Rail 150 Steam Cavalcade held at Shildon in County Durham, an event held to mark the 150th anniversary of the opening of the Stockton & Darlington Railway, which featured the engine running over a section of the BR network, although the line was subject to special restrictions at the time. Additionally, the engine also ran a number of shuttles into the wagon works complex from the railway station, top-and-tailing the workings with NER Class P3 No.65894 from the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.\n\nIf future plans to extend the Isle of Wight Steam Railway from Smallbrook Junction to Ryde St. John's are successful, this may see members of that railways fleet, including their two A1X engines, running over Network Rail track between the two locations.\n\nAn A1X class locomotive, \"Stepney\" appears in \"Stepney the \"Bluebell\" Engine\", one of the books in The Railway Series of children's books written by the Rev. W. Awdry. \"Boxhill\" was referred to in a later book in the series: \"Thomas & the Great Railway Show\". Stepney also appears in the television spin-off Thomas & Friends.\n\nThe 1975 Ken Russell film Lisztomania includes a sequence shot on the Bluebell Railway which features No.72 \"Fenchurch\" smashing a grand piano left on the line while running at speed (actually filmed with the engine running at 25 mph, the speed limit of the line, with the film sped up for impact).\n\nA 1961 film version of Anna Karenina, parts of which were filmed on 'The Bluebell Railway', included No.55 Stepney disguised as a Russian locomotive.\n\nTwo of the three locomotives sold to Pauling & Co. were exported to South America and one worked on the La Plata tramway in the 1920s.\n\nEight locomotives were built by local Australian builders for the New South Wales Government Railways, Australia – to the LB&SCR's general arrangement and drawings – and entered traffic as the N67 class at about the same time as the A1X class in England. They were essentially identical engines, except for a simpler cab, larger bunker, larger sandboxes and other various detail differences. They became redundant from about 1890 after the introduction of larger and more powerful tank locomotives and many were fitted with small cranes in place of the bunker. In this form they were put to work as shunters and as \"coal grabs\" - small mobile coal loaders for refuelling larger locomotives at depots. Some saw service with other groups into the 1930s. They were less successful than their English cousins due to rather different operating conditions and all were scrapped before the start of the preservation era.\n\nHornby Railways manufacture models of the A1 & A1x in OO gauge while Dapol produce them in N scale, OO gauge (in conjunction with Rails of Sheffield) and O gauge.\n\n\n"}

Up until that season, there was one cup, the FIBA European Champions' Cup (which is now called the EuroLeague), though in this season of 2000–01, the leading European teams split into two competitions: the FIBA SuproLeague and Euroleague Basketball Company's Euroleague 2000–01.\n\nThe season started on October 18, 2000, and ended on May 13, 2001. The competition's Final Four took place at Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, in Paris, France.\n\nThe EuroLeague (or historically called, the \"European Champions' Cup\") was originally established by FIBA, and it operated under its umbrella from 1958, until the summer of 2000, concluding with the 1999–2000 season. Euroleague Basketball was created on 1 July 2000.\n\nBecause FIBA had never trademarked the \"EuroLeague\" name, Euroleague Basketball used it without any legal ramifications as FIBA had no legal recourse to do anything about it. Therefore, FIBA had to find a new name for their league and chose \"\"SuproLeague\"\". The 2000–01 season started with two separate top European professional club basketball competitions: the FIBA SuproLeague (previously known as the FIBA EuroLeague) and the brand new Euroleague.\n\nThe rift in European professional club basketball initially showed no signs of letting up. Top clubs were also split between the two leagues: Panathinaikos, Maccabi Elite Tel Aviv, CSKA Moscow, and Efes Pilsen stayed with FIBA, while Olympiacos, Kinder Bologna, Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, Tau Cerámica, and Benetton Treviso joined Euroleague Basketball.\n\n\nThe first phase was a regular season, in which the twenty competing teams were drawn into two groups, each containing ten teams. Each team played every other team in its group at home and away, resulting in 18 games for each team. The top 8 teams in each group advanced to the Round of 16, and the winners of this round advanced to the Quarterfinals. Both of the rounds were played in a Best-of-three playoff system. The winning teams of the Quarterfinals qualified to the SuproLeague Final Four, which was held in the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, in Paris, on 10–13 May 2001.\n\nIf one or more clubs were level on won-lost record, tiebreakers were applied in the following order:\n\nMay 11, Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, Paris\n\nMay 13, Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, Paris\n\nMay 13, Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, Paris\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2001, Europe had two continental champions, Maccabi Elite Tel Aviv of the FIBA SuproLeague and Kinder Bologna of Euroleague Basketball Company's EuroLeague. The leaders of both organizations realized the need to come up with a new single competition. Negotiating from the position of strength, Euroleague Basketball Company dictated proceedings and FIBA essentially had no choice but to agree to their terms. As a result, the EuroLeague was fully integrated under Euroleague Basketball Company's umbrella, and teams that competed in the FIBA SuproLeague during the 2000–01 season joined it as well. It is today officially admitted that European basketball had two champions that year, Maccabi of the FIBA SuproLeague and Kinder Bologna of the Euroleague Basketball Company's EuroLeague.\n\nA year later, Euroleague Basketball Company and FIBA decided that Euroleague Basketball's EuroLeague competition would be the main basketball tournament on the continent, to be played between the top level teams of Europe. FIBA Europe would also organize a European league for third-tier level teams, known as the FIBA Europe League competition, while Euroleague Basketball would also organize its own second-tier level league, combining FIBA's long-time FIBA Saporta Cup and FIBA Korać Cup competitions into one new competition, the EuroCup. In 2005, Euroleague Basketball and FIBA decided to cooperate with each other and did so until 2016.\n\nIn essence, the authority in European professional basketball was divided over club-country lines. FIBA stayed in charge of national team competitions (like the FIBA EuroBasket, the FIBA World Cup, and the Summer Olympics), while Euroleague Basketball took over the European professional club competitions. From that point on, FIBA Saporta Cup and FIBA Korać Cup competitions lasted only one more season before folding, which was when Euroleague Basketball launched the EuroCup.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2246063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246063", "title": "Drowned World/Substitute for Love", "text": "Drowned World/Substitute for Love\n\n\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" is a song recorded by American singer Madonna for her seventh studio album, \"Ray of Light\" (1998). It was written and produced by Madonna and William Orbit, with additional songwriters including Rod McKuen, Anita Kerr and David Collins. McKuen and Kerr received the credits due to the usage of a sample from one of their songs, \"Why I Follow the Tigers\". \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" is an ambient pop song which lyrically describes Madonna's spiritual transformation to seek authentic love over superficial alliances.\n\n\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" was released as the album's third single on August 24, 1998 worldwide, except in the United States. It became Madonna's seventh number-one single in Spain, while charting within the top ten in Iceland and the United Kingdom. The B-side of the single, \"Sky Fits Heaven\", reached number 41 on the US Dance Club Songs chart.\n\nAn accompanying music video was released for the song, featuring Madonna running away from the paparazzi until she arrives at home. The video faced strong reaction in the media due to the paparazzi chase sequences, a scenario similar to Diana, Princess of Wales's death in 1997. The song was performed in two of Madonna's tours, these being the Drowned World Tour (2001) and the Confessions Tour (2006). She also performed the track at the London stop of her Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16), in memory of Collins, as well as the show in Melbourne.\n\nSince 1996, Madonna went through a number of \"life-changing experiences\". She gave birth to her daughter Lourdes, became interested in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah, and was enlisted for the title role on the film adaptation of the musical \"Evita\" (1996). A year later, following the promotion of the \"Evita\" soundtrack, she started working on \"Ray of Light\", her seventh studio album. Madonna wrote songs with William Orbit, Patrick Leonard, Rick Nowels and Babyface but the songs from the latter did not make it to the final track list. The album would reflect the singer's changed perspectives about life. Author Carol Benson noted that it was a \"deeply spiritual dance record\", with the crux of it based on liberation of Madonna from her own career and the many identities she had assumed over the years. Motherhood had softened the singer emotionally, which was reflected in the songs. She started talking about ideas and used words which implied deep and personal thoughts, rather than the regular dance-floor anthemic tunes she had composed.\n\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\", the first song on the album, was written and produced by Madonna and Orbit, with additional writers including Rod McKuen, Anita Kerr and David Collins. The singer's manager Guy Oseary had telephoned and asked Orbit for collaborating on the album. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, which included a demo version of the track. According to Madonna, she had been a fan of Orbit's work for a long time and was pleased with the demo. The song includes a sample from the song \"Why I Follow the Tigers\" by the San Sebastian Strings, a group created by both Kerr and McKuen. The vocal sample was of a man uttering the words \"you see\", later confirmed by him to be actor Jesse Pearson. Both McKuen and Kerr received co-writing credits on \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" due to the inclusion of the sample, and also because thematically the track follows a plotline that transpired in \"Why I Follow the Tigers\". Madonna was a great admirer of Collins' interior designing and had commissioned for designing a friend's night club located in Miami. He later ended up as one of the writers on the song.\n\nThe most important track on the album according to the singer, \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" was released as the third single from \"Ray of Light\" on August 24, 1998 worldwide, except in the United States. In the latter market, the album's second single \"Ray of Light\" had been released with a one-month delay, so Madonna's record label decided to release \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" outside of North America, thereby closing the one-month gap between the next single \"The Power of Good-Bye\" (1998). The song received remix treatment from musicians like Brian \"BT\" Transeau and Sasha, and according to \"Billboard\" was one of the most expected tracks to be remixed.\n\n\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" was recorded, with the rest of the album, at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood, California. It was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Studios in New York. An ambient poptrack, it takes the title from author J.G. Ballard's post-apocalyptic science fiction novel, \"The Drowned World\" (1962). The final version progressed significantly from the DAT demo, which Orbit described as \"serendipity\". However they kept the initial roughness, resisting adding too many tweaks. The producer added random echoing and pulsating effects, and the drum fills were created from splicing small fragments of music. Madonna and Orbit had conducted a drummer session in Los Angeles, but it did not work out. Instead, Orbit commissioned Fergus Gerrand to play drum samples in London. Orbit fed these into his workstation and cut them manually, instead of using auto-editing software like ReCycle.\nThe song begins with ambient music and the stereo sound oscillating. This continues for 40 seconds. The music is interspersed with trip hop and psychedelic elements, both at the foreground and background. As McKuen's sample utters the words \"you see\", Madonna utters the first lyrics, \"I traded fame for love / Without a second thought\", and at around the 1:30 minute mark, the drums start with the first chorus. The composition builds slowly, with a Jimi Hendrix-like guitar sound complementing the music. An acoustic guitar comes into prominence from 2:49 minute mark, and the sounds of piano can be heard in the distance. Arpeggios consisting of electric guitar are added in the mix, and ultimately the drum sounds become heavy. Orbit adds guitars and increases the volume with the electronic sounds becoming turbulent. Madonna's singing gathers momentum and intensity, belting, \"No one night stand, no far off land / No fire that I can spark\", when it suddenly subsides, ebbing away.\nThroughout the song, her vocals are subdued in nature, emoting a thoughtful imagery, with the melody being laid out gently for the listener. Bryan Lark from \"The Michigan Daily\" described Madonna's singing and composition of the song as \"soulful\". According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com, the record is set in time signature of common time with a key of B major. It has a slow tempo of 72 beats per minute with Madonna's vocals ranging from the notes of F to A. The track begins with a basic chord progression of F5–G–E–A–G, which changes into A–G–B–Cm during the rest of the verses and A–E–B in the chorus.\n\nLyrically \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" finds Madonna taking accountability of her life, fame and adulation, while assessing her career and journey. It is a summary of her experience of fame, exemplified by lines such as, \"I got exactly what I asked for [...] Running, rushing back for more [...] And now I find, I've changed my mind\". Rikky Rooksby, author of \"The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna\" noted the track ended with the line \"This is my religion\", indicating the spiritual thoughts and themes present in \"Ray of Light\". According to Lucy O'Brien, author of \"\", the lyrics touch upon Madonna's desire for fame and how it ultimately ruined her personal relationships, thereby \"[setting] the tone for the album\". In an interview for \"Q\" magazine, Madonna explained:\n\n\"I realise, and I've been realising this for years, that the approval – the headiness of being swept up and being popular and loved by people in universal ways – is absolutely no substitute for truly being loved. But if you have to have a substitute, it's about the best there is.\"\n\nO'Brien commended the usage of electronic sounds and bleeps in the track as well as the \"bell like clarity\" in Madonna's vocals, a result of the training she had received from her \"Evita\" days. Kenneth Bielen, author of \"The Lyrics of Civility\" declared the record as a \"slice of Madonna's autobiography\", praising the lyrics for forecasting what the singer's life could become. Allen Metz wrote in the book, \"The Madonna Companion\", that the lyrics did not give an impression of \"sophisticated wordplay\", but was commendable for telling the truth about Madonna's life and career. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic labelled the song as a \"swirling\" and \"meditative opener\". David Browne from \"Entertainment Weekly\" described the track, along with \"Frozen\" from the album, as \"breathtaking\", complimenting its beats. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine found Madonna's belting to be the most \"emotionally candid\" she has been since \"Like a Prayer\" (1989).\n\nOther critics complimented the different nature of the song and its production. Reviewing the album for \"The Michigan Daily\", Lark said, \"['Drowned World/Substitute for Love'] [creates] a brilliant, ecstatic pop catharsis that all but eclipses every mistake she's ever made, including the virginal writhing, gold-tooth sporting and naked hitchhiking of her sordid past\", the last part referring to Madonna's antics during her fifth studio album, \"Erotica\" (1992) era. Rob Sheffield from \"Rolling Stone\" found it to be the \"perfect opener\" for \"Ray of Light\" and its various contradiction filled tracks. Noting the different musical elements, including drum loops, strings, computer bleeping as well as jungle snares, Sheffield compared them to a person's shopping experience and unpacking of the bags after the activity ends. The reviewer ended by saying that the track came off as \"loud, tacky and ridiculous\", but still exuded emotion in the music. In a review of Madonna's hits album \"GHV2\" (2001), Charlotte Robinson from \"PopMatters\" commended Orbit's production work on the track along with others from \"Ray of Light\". She added that the songs are \"a testament to his ability to use gadgets and electronic wizardry not to alienate listeners, but to draw them in\".\n\n'Substitute for Love', Stuart Maconie wrote in a \"Q\" review of \"Ray of Light\", \"emerges languorously from a fog of enigmatic samples and the low-key burbling that are Orbit's forte… prayer bells tinkle and snare fills skim the surface tension of the song in a nod to drum 'n' bass.\" In 2003, fans voted for their top 20 Madonna singles in \"Q\", and awarded \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" the number 17 spot. In a retrospective review of \"Ray of Light\", Idolator's Stephen Sears described the track as \"the first chapter of a great novel\" setting the tone for rest of the record. \"Rolling Stone\" placed the track at number 20, on their ranking of Madonna's 50 Greatest Song in 2016, describing it as \"a ballad exploring epiphanies about fame and family\". While ranking Madonna's singles in honor of her 60th birthday, \"The Guardian\"s Jude Rogers placed the song at number 12, calling it \"majestic, reflective and sung in a subdued style for Madonna [...] this meditation on fame with a Ballardian reference in its title soars quietly and gorgeously\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" debuted and peaked at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart on September 5, 1998. It quickly descended down the charts, being present for a total of nine weeks within the top-100. The song has sold a total of 90,651 copies in the country as of August 2008, according to the Official Charts Company.\n\nIn mainland Europe, \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" entered the official Spanish Singles Chart at number 10 on the issue date August 29, 1998. The next week, it jumped to number one, where it stayed for one week. It was the third single from \"Ray of Light\" to reach the top of the chart—Madonna's seventh single overall—following \"Frozen\" and \"Ray of Light\". In Austria, the song peaked at number 34, staying in the charts for only one week. In Switzerland, it reached its peak position number 31 on the second week, staying in the charts for five weeks in total. The song had more success on the French Singles Chart, where it debuted at number 88 and gradually moved up the charts, finally peaking at number 42 and staying in the charts for 17 weeks. In the Netherlands, the song debuted at number 63, and rose to number 43 for one week. In Sweden, the song debuted at number 41 but fell to number 57 the next week.\n\nIn Australia, the single debuted at number 74, climbing to its peak of number 16 the following week before descending down the charts. On the New Zealand Singles Chart, the song debuted at number 30, until rising to its peak of number 21, and then descending down. Since the song was not released in the United States, it did not chart on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 or any other component charts. However, the B-Side of the single \"Sky Fits Heaven\" managed to reach number 41 on the US Dance Club Songs chart, aided by its remixes.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" was directed by Walter Stern and filmed on June 26–27, 1998 at London's Claridge's Hotel and Piccadilly Circus. It includes cameo appearances by Anita Pallenberg and Steve Strange. It was released in September 1998, and features Madonna leaving her home and being chased by paparazzi. Dressed in black, she is constantly running, even from the other celebrities in a hotel bar. Except for Madonna's, everyone else's face is distorted. In another sequence of the clip, Madonna passes a hotel maid smiling at her. The singer returns the smile when the flash of a camera goes off; the maid has just taken a picture of her. Madonna flees again, running all the way home to her daughter's arms, singing that she has \"changed her mind\" about being a celebrity.\n\nThe video generated controversy due to the scenes that featured Madonna being chased by paparazzi on motor-bikes, a scenario similar to the incidents that led to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg said that the clip had nothing to do with Diana's death and was instead about \"Madonna's relationship to fame [...] There are paparazzi in the video. But it's not like Madonna hasn't had experience with them. It's a day in the life of Madonna.\" \"Daily Mirror\" columnist Matthew Wright said \"The similarities [to Diana's death] are undeniable\", finding it disgusting.\n\nThe clip was initially reported by \"Billboard\" to be released in the US outlets after the release of the video for \"The Power of Good-bye\", but the plan did not materialize. It was finally included on the DVD compilation, \"\". In 2013, a poll by Logo TV about \"Madonna's 55 Best Music Videos\" listed the clip at number 11, describing it to be \"just as much about the ugly comforts of celebrity and its reality-distorting side-effects. This underrated clip is one of Madonna's most personal statements, and her vocals are downright chilling\". The manga like distorted\nfaces of the celebrities in the clip was listed by \"Dazed\" magazine as one of \"five favourite manga-eyed moments from pop videos\".\n\nOn November 23, 1998, Madonna appeared on the Spanish RTVE show \"El Séptimo de Caballeria\" and performed \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\", along with her other song \"The Power of Good-Bye\". Three years later, Madonna named her 2001 Drowned World Tour after the song, and performed it as the opening number. She entered the stage amidst billows of dry ice, dressed in a sleeveless black top, crossover top with one net sleeve, jeans with zips and bondage straps, a studded dog collar and a tartan kilt and performed the song standing on a rising platform on the middle of the stage. Also during this same tour, the last lyrics from the song (\"Now, I find I changed my mind/This is my religion\") were used at the end of the performance of \"Ray of Light\". The performance at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan on August 26, 2001 was released in the live video release, \"Drowned World Tour 2001\". Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH gave the performance a positive review, saying it was sung beautifully. Joshua Clover from \"Spin\" described Madonna's arrival during the performance as \"[the singer] taking the style war to stage\".\n\nDuring the Confessions Tour in 2006, Madonna sat down on the middle of the stage and performed an acoustic, stripped-down version of the song. She was joined by Yitzhak Sinwani of the London Kabbalah Centre, who had also been present earlier in the show for the performance of the song \"Isaac\". Writing for \"Pitchfork Media\", Stephen Deusner complimented Madonna's singing, saying that \" she's got a deeper, heartier range that works best on ballads like 'Drowned World'\". The song was not included on the NBC special, \"The Confessions Tour: Live from London\", which aired on November 22, 2006, but it was present on the full-length DVD release. The track was performed on the London stop of the Rebel Heart Tour, on December 2, 2015, at The O Arena, in memory of Collins, who had died two years ago. The following year, it was included on the setlist of her show in Melbourne, Australia. The show started with Madonna appearing onstage, in a clown's costume consisting of a billowing dress, pink and yellow stalkings, riding a tricycle and circled round it.\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from \"Ray of Light\" album liner notes.\n\n"}

They are best known for their 1986 No. 2 US single \"Keep Your Hands to Yourself\".\n\nIn 1980, Dan Baird (formerly guitarist for the Atlanta band the Nasty Bucks), along with lead guitarist Rick Richards, bassist Keith Christopher (formerly of The Brains), and drummer David Michaelson formed a band named Keith and the Satellites in Atlanta, Georgia. After performing in local bars, the band's line-up changed. With a new bassist, Dave Hewitt (previously with Babe Ruth), and a new drummer, Randy DeLay, they recorded a six-track demo at Axis Studios in Atlanta. During this time, the band changed their name to Georgia Satellites and played every Monday at Hedgens, a bar in the Atlanta neighborhood of Buckhead.\n\nJeff Glixman, who had produced, mixed and remastered artists such as Paul Stanley, Kansas, Gary Moore, Yngwie Malmsteen and Black Sabbath, was enlisted for production. However, soon after the demo was recorded, the band broke up in the summer of 1984. DeLay later performed with the Tony Sarno Band and the Hell Hounds around the Atlanta music circuit, before dying of cancer in 1993.\n\nAlthough the band felt they were not making any progress on their musical path and had disbanded, their English manager, Kevin Jennings, took the demo to a small Yorkshire record label, Making Waves, who liked the material and released the demo as the \"Keep the Faith\" EP in 1985. The press response to the EP was positive and prompted the band to regroup in the United States. Baird had been playing with the Woodpeckers in North Carolina. Richards remained in Atlanta with the Hell Hounds, which included both Mauro Magellan (drums) and Rick Price (bass). With Baird essentially joining the Hell Hounds, the Georgia Satellites were reborn and American record labels started taking notice of the band.\n\nIn 1986, the group signed with Elektra Records and reunited with Glixman to record their debut full-length album at Cheshire Sound Studios in Atlanta. The album, \"Georgia Satellites\", was their most successful LP; featuring the track \"Keep Your Hands to Yourself\". The song reached No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, topped only by Bon Jovi's \"Livin' on a Prayer\". It went into heavy rotation on MTV. Other lesser-known songs included \"Battleship Chains\" (No. 86), written by Terry Anderson and \"Can't Stand the Pain\", but the Georgia Satellites never had another Top 40 hit. That same year the MTV Video Music Awards came into being. Mary Deacon won for Best Art Director on the music video \"Keep Your Hands to Yourself.\"\n\nIn 1988, the band recorded a cover of The Swinging Blue Jeans' 1964 hit \"Hippy Hippy Shake\" for the movie \"Cocktail\". Released as a single, the song reached No. 45 on the \"Billboard\" chart. During that year, the band released their second album, \"Open All Night\"; which included a cover of the Ringo Starr-written Beatles song \"Don't Pass Me By\", although the album was not as successful as their debut. A single, \"Open All Night\" backed with \"Dunk 'n' Dine,\" failed to chart.\n\nA third studio album, \"In the Land of Salvation and Sin\", was released in 1989, which included re-recordings of \"Six Years Gone\" and \"Crazy\" from the 1985 EP. Although the album received very positive reviews, it too failed to do well commercially, and Baird left the band in 1990 to pursue a solo career.\n\nThe band's 1993 compilation \"Let It Rock: The Best of the Georgia Satellites\" included a selection of the best tracks from the three studio albums and bonus material that had been released on the \"Another Chance\" EP (1989): \"Saddle Up,\" \"That Woman,\" and \"I'm Waiting For The Man.\" Also included was a live version of Chuck Berry's \"Let It Rock.\"\n\nAfter a brief sabbatical following the departure of Dan Baird, the Georgia Satellites reunited in 1993. Their current lineup, led by original member Rick Richards (lead guitar, backing and lead vocals), along with Fred McNeal (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Bruce Smith (bass, backing vocals), and Todd Johnston (drums) continues to perform live shows. The most recent album, \"Shaken Not Stirred\" (1997), was a mix of re-recordings of their earlier material and eight new songs: \"Running Out,\" \"Let It Rock (Bye Bye Johnny),\" \"Deep in the Heart of Dixie,\" \"Anna Lee,\" \"My Fault,\" \"Shaken Not Stirred,\" \"She Fades Away,\" and \"Rain.\"\n\nBaird performs with his band, Homemade Sin, which features three former members of the Georgia Satellites. Mauro Magellan joined The Crashers after moving to Wisconsin in the early 1990s. Mauro played on both of Baird's solo albums and continues to tour with him as a member of Homemade Sin, which also includes bassist Keith Christopher, formerly of Keith and the Satellites. In addition, Baird performs as a member of the country groups Trent Summar & The New Row Mob and The Yayhoos.\n\nAlong with his commitment to the Georgia Satellites, Richards also plays with former Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin in his band, Izzy Stradlin and the Ju Ju Hounds. They toured in the early 1990s and have recorded 11 albums. Richards, along with ex-Satellites manager Kevin Jennings, released an album entitled \"For Ol' Times Sake\" in 2013 as The Western Sizzlers, which enlisted the talents of Charlie Starr of Blackberry Smoke as well as seasoned Atlanta musicians Nicky Ford, Jeff Bakos, and Kevin \"Snit\" Fitzpatrick.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was the second single from Mayer's 2003 album \"Heavier Things\".\n\nThe song's meaning is not immediately clear. Some interpretations have characterized the song as being about coming to terms with a relationship, while others have interpreted the song as being about a person's own self-perception. At his February 28, 2007, show at Madison Square Garden, John introduced \"Clarity\" as a song written about the first few seconds after waking up in the morning when you don't remember all of the problems and worries in your life. At the \"\"Soundstage with Buddy Guy\"\" concert, Mayer explained the song as one of the best he's done, in that it's the best in portraying his thoughts and feelings.\n\nThe music video for \"Clarity\" was directed by Director X. It was filmed on the Santa Monica Pier and the Pacific Coast Highway.\n\n\"Clarity\" peaked at #13 on the \"Billboard\" Adult Top 40 chart and #25 on the \"Billboard\" Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart.\n\nThis song was covered by saxophonist Najee for his album \"Rising Sun\" in 2007.\n\n\n"}

The dialectal split occurred after Christianisation of the region (4th century AD) and at the time of the Slavic migration to the Balkans, with the river as the historic dialectal boundary which straddled the Jireček line.\n\nOn various historical periods it was considered the northernmost natural boundary of Epirus, while during the 5th and 6th centuries it was the cultural border between the Illyrian and the Greek world. During this period the valley of Skumbin constituted roughly the border between the Latin and the Greek speaking area.\n\n"}
{"id": "2246089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246089", "title": "Limbaži", "text": "Limbaži\n\nLimbaži (, , , ) is a town in the Vidzeme region of northern Latvia. Limbaži is located 90 km northeast of the capital Riga. The population is 8705 people. During the Middle Ages, as part of Livonia, Limbazi was a fortified town with stone walls, second in importance only to Riga.\n\nThe name \"Limbaž\" is believed to be a Livonian word meaning \"wide isle in a forest swamp\". The German \"Lemsahl\" is derived from the Livonian name.\n\nAccording to folk etymology, the name \"Limbaži\" originated sometime in the 17th century. A recently arrived Swedish minister overheard some gibberish, \"limba\" and \"aži\". Mistakenly, he assumed this was the name of the village, and so the town was called \"Limbaži\".\n\nIn ancient times, Limbaži was a Livonian settlement known as Lemisele, part of Metsepole. In the early 13th century, Bishop Albert and the Teutonic knights destroyed the village while conquering Metsepole, and built a castle, around which formed the new city, \"Lemsahl\".\n\nUntil the beginning of the 16th century, Lemsahl could be reached by seagoing vessels travelling up the Svētupe. Ships came from as far as Lübeck and Copenhagen to trade for honey, wax, lumber, grain, and furs. The small trading camp surrounding the castle grew into a large town, and was admitted to the Hanseatic League. Each year, Lemsahl hosted a conference attended by barons from all over Livonia, and the city hosted at least three other fairs throughout the year as well. During these fairs, the town may have held as many as 20,000 people at once. In addition, the Bishop of Riga made Lemsahl his spring residence, which became a walled city to protect both the bishop and the trading center.\nIn population, Lemsahl was second only to Riga.\n\nBy 1500, however, the Svētupe became too shallow to navigate. Goods were sent elsewhere, and Lemsahl began a century long decline. During the Livonian War, Ivan the Terrible's forces burned down Lemsahl in 1558, while its residents fled to the nearby forests and marshes for shelter. The city was burned down by the Swedes in 1567, and again by the Russians in 1575. In 1602, the Swedes and Poles fought yet again for the city, completely demolishing its fortifications and walls. By the time the wars had ended, the city was so demolished, only three houses and a handful of residents remained.\n\nWhile under Swedish rule, the village was renamed Limbaži sometime in the 17th century. During the Great Northern War, Vidzeme was totally ravaged by Peter the Great's forces. But as the story goes, while searching for Limbaži, the Russian army got lost in a heavy fog. After stumbling in circles, the soldiers began to believe such a village may not exist after all, and moved on. Limbaži survived the war unscathed.\n\nThe city completely burned down again in 1747, after which today's city layout began to develop. In the 19th century, the city began to grow again. In 1821 there were 674 inhabitants, but by 1900 there were about 2000. In 1876, hat-maker A.Tīls opened \"Limbažu Filcs\", the town's oldest company, which also secured jobs for generations of the city's inhabitants. The first town library was built in the late 19th century, and several publishing houses were opened, the largest of which was K.Paucīsis Press.\n\nAfter World War I Limbaži continued to grow. The long-awaited rail line to Riga opened in 1934, and a 50-bed hospital opened in 1936. During the Soviet occupation the population increased to 8,000, with many five-storey Soviet-style apartments appearing in the 1960s. During the Soviet period, Limbaži became a factory-town with \"Lauktehnika\" farm machinery, \"Limbažu Filcs\" hats, and \"Limbažu Piens\" one of the largest milk processors in Latvia, all based there.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Greenberg\n\nMartin Harry Greenberg (March 1, 1941 – June 25, 2011) was an American academic and speculative fiction anthologist. In all, he compiled 1,298 anthologies and commissioned over 8,200 original short stories. He founded Tekno Books, a packager of more than 2000 published books. As well, he was a co-founder of the Sci-Fi Channel. Greenberg was also a terrorism and Middle East expert. He was a long-time friend, colleague and business partner of Isaac Asimov.\n\nGreenberg was born to Max and Mae Greenberg in South Miami Beach, Florida. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of Miami, a doctorate in political science from the University of Connecticut in 1969, and taught at the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay from 1975 until 1996. Early in his career he was sometimes confused with Martin Greenberg, publisher of Gnome Press; they were not related. Isaac Asimov suggested that he call himself \"Martin H. Greenberg\" or \"Martin Harry Greenberg\" to distinguish him from the other Martin Greenberg \"if he expected to deal fruitfully with the science-fiction world\".\n\nGreenberg's first anthology (and first speculative fiction publication) was \"\" (Prentice-Hall, 1974), edited with Patricia S. Warrick and intended for use as a teaching guide. Warrick was a colleague at one of the UW two-year colleges, University of Wisconsin–Fox Valley, who recruited Greenberg to give one lecture on the future of politics. He learned that her course used one science fiction text; she learned of his interest and made a \"career-changing comment\". Ten educational anthologies under the series name \"Through Science Fiction\" followed through 1978, mainly from Rand McNally. In the late 1970s Greenberg began partnering with Joseph D. Olander on more conventional science fiction anthologies. They also created the critical series \"Writers of the 21st Century\" (Taplinger, 1977 to 1983) produced six of its seven volumes, each titled for its featured author.\n\nGreenberg typically teamed up with another editor, splitting the duties of story selection, editing, copyright searches, and handling royalties to authors. Major partners include Isaac Asimov (127 anthologies, most notably \"The Great SF Stories\" series), Charles G. Waugh (193 anthologies), Jane Yolen, and Robert Silverberg. He and Mark Tier shared two Prometheus Special Awards in 2005 for jointly creating the anthologies \"Give Me Liberty\" and \"Visions of Liberty\" (Baen Books, 2004). He also shared one Bram Stoker Award from the horror writers for the 1998 anthology \"Horrors! 365 Scary Stories\".\n\nThe Horror Writers Association gave Greenberg its highest honor in 2003, the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement recognizing superior work that \"substantially influenced the horror genre\". He also received the Ellery Queen Award, which honors \"outstanding people in the mystery-publishing industry\", from the Mystery Writers of America in 1995 and one of three inaugural Solstice Awards in 2009, from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America for his lifetime contributions to their field.\n\nGreenberg died in Green Bay, Wisconsin on June 25, 2011 from complications of cancer. He was survived by two stepdaughters from his first wife, by his second wife, and by their daughter. He is buried at the Cnesses Israel Hebrew Cemetery in Green Bay.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2246106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246106", "title": "Carnyx", "text": "Carnyx\n\nThe carnyx was a wind instrument of the Iron Age Celts, used between c. 200 BC and c. AD 200. It was a type of bronze trumpet with an elongated S shape, held so that the long straight central portion was vertical and the short mouthpiece end section and the much wider bell were horizontal in opposed directions. The bell was styled in the shape of an open-mouthed boar's, or other animal's, head. \n\nIt was used in warfare, probably to incite troops to battle and intimidate opponents, as Polybius recounts. The instrument's significant height allowed it to be heard over the heads of the participants in battles or ceremonies.\n\nThe word \"carnyx\" is derived from the Gaulish root, \"carn-\" or \"cern-\" meaning \"antler\" or \"horn,\" and the same root of the name of the god, Cernunnos.\n\nUntil 2004, fragments of only five carnyces had been preserved, from modern Scotland, France, Germany, Romania and Switzerland, but in 2004 archaeologists discovered a first-century-BC deposit at Tintignac in Corrèze, France.\n\nIn September 2004, over 500 fragments of iron and bronze objects were discovered in a Gallic pit. The objects included a dozen swords and scabbards, iron spearheads, a shield, ten bronze helmets and an iron bird, 2 animal heads, one animal body, a cauldron, and seven Carnyces, one of which is almost complete. These unique military and religious objects are currently being studied by Christophe Maniquet’s team, and are in the process of conservation and restoration by the \"Materia Viva\" laboratory in Toulouse.\n\nFour of the carnyces had boar's heads, the fifth appears to be a serpent-like monster; they appear to represent a ritual deposit dating to soon after the Roman conquest of Gaul. The Tintignac finds enabled some fragments found in northern Italy decades before to be identified in 2012 as coming from a carnyx.\n\nThe only example from the British Isles is the Deskford Carnyx, found at the farm of Leitchestown, Deskford, Banffshire, Scotland in 1816. Only the boar's head bell survives, also apparently placed as a ritual deposit. It was donated to Banff Museum, and is now on loan from Aberdeenshire Museums Service to the Museum of Scotland. The location and age of the Deskford Carnyx suggests the instrument had a peaceful, ceremonial use and was not only used in warfare. \n\nBefore 2004 this was the best surviving example, and generally copied in earlier reconstructions. The Deskford find was made almost entirely of brass, a metal used almost exclusively by the Romans, and strictly controlled by them. Further, the basic size and shape of the Deskford find suggests it may in fact have been a Roman military draco standard.\n\nThe instrument is known from depictions on coins and reliefs, notably from Trajan's Column and the so-called initiation scene of the Gundestrup cauldron.\n\nThe name is known from textual sources, carnyces are reported from the Celtic attack on the Delphi in 279 BC, as well as from Julius Caesar's campaign in Gaul and Claudius' invasion of Britain. Diodorus Siculus around 60-30 BC said (Histories, 5.30):\nObjects found at Tintignac were exhibited at the 2012 exhibition \"Les Gaulois, une expo renversante\" (\"The Gauls, a stunning exhibition\").\n\nThe reconstruction of the Deskford Carnyx was initiated by Dr. John Purser, and commenced in 1991 funded jointly by the Glenfiddich Living Scotland award and the National Museums of Scotland. In addition to John Purser as musicologist, the team comprised the archaeologist Fraser Hunter, silversmith John Creed, and trombonist John Kenny. After 2,000 years of silence the reconstructed Deskford Carnyx was unveiled at the National Museum of Scotland in April 1993.\n\nIn 1993 Kenny became the first person to play the carnyx in 2,000 years, and has since lectured and performed on the instrument internationally, in the concert hall, on radio, television, and film. There are numerous compositions for the carnyx and it is featured on seven CDs. On 15 March 2003 he performed solo to an audience of 65,000 in the Stade De France in Paris.\n\nOn 15 June 2017 \"The Music of the Forest\", a specially commissioned work by Lakeland composer, Christopher Gibbs, featuring a reconstructed carnyx, received its world premiere at Slaidburn Village Hall. The four-part song cycle evoked the landscape and history of the Forest of Bowland and was performed by the Renaissance Singers of Blackburn Cathedral under the direction of Samuel Hudson. The carnyx was played by John Kenny.\n\nThe carnyx is featured in the opening battle scene of \"Gladiator\" (2000); and is used as both a musical instrument and a fear-inducing weapon. It appears in several battle scenes of the French film, \"Druids\" (2001). A carnyx appears near the beginning of the 2012 Pixar computer animated film \"Brave\".\n\n\n\n"}

Fox was the drummer for six months before being replaced during their first album at Rockfield Studios, Monmouth, Wales, recording sessions by Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor. Fox's drumming appeared on the \"On Parole\" album track, \"Lost Johnny\" which, unlike the rest of the songs Fox recorded for the album, were not overdubbed with Taylor's drums.\n\nLucas also appeared in the band's 10th anniversary video in 1985, joining the band on stage for the final number, \"Motorhead\", at Hammersmith Odeon, London.\n\nIn Spring 1977, Warsaw Pakt formed around Ladbroke Grove, London, composed of lead guitarist Andy Colquhoun of The Rockets, Fox on drums, vocalist Jimmy Coull, John Walker on rhythm guitar, and Chris Underhill on bass.

His gimmick was similar to that of George Steele and Kamala, a crazy out-of-control wild man who needed a trainer or manager to lead him to the ring. During his matches, Robertson would often ram his own head repeatedly into the turnbuckle or wooden chair, headbutt and dive head first onto an opponent.\n\nHe achieved his greatest fame late in his career, wrestling in WCCW, managed by Skandor Akbar and in the WWF, managed by Bobby Heenan and Jimmy Hart in the mid-1980s.\n\nRobertson started wrestling in his native Canada in the 1960s as Dewey Robertson. He was a very popular babyface in the Toronto area. It was long believed that he was a protege of former NWA world champion Whipper Billy Watson (William Potts), but Watson did not start him in the business. Watson was, however, the godfather of Robertson`s sons. He left to wrestle in the Southern United States and Australia in 1973, but returned a year later as \"The Masked Crusader\" with manager John St. John (John Lang). He was on a crusade to keep wrestling scientific but was soon unmasked by The Sheik. After that, Robertson formed a tag team called \"The Crusaders\" with Billy Red Lyons. He also owned a gym in the 1970s, and had a famous television spot where he tore up a phone book in a supermarket ad.\nRobertson's first title victory came in May 1973 when he teamed with Dennis Stamp to win the Tri-State version of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship. They held the belts until July, when they dropped them to Alex Perez and El Gran Tapio. Robertson found more success in tag team wrestling the following year while competing in Toronto, Ontario. He teamed with Billy Red Lyons to win the Toronto version of the NWA International Tag Team Championship from The Love Brothers (Hartford and Reginald) on June 23, 1974. The Love Brothers regained the belts on September 8, but Robertson and Lyons won them back on December 29. They then held the belts for over six months before dropping the titles to Mike and Pat Kelly in June 1975. Robertson and Lyons had one final reign as champions, when they won a rematch on August 24. During one match his right leg was broken while performing a sunset flip on one of the Kelly twins. He and Lyons also toured Japan.\n\nIn 1979, Robertson wrestled in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions as a heel with \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers as his manager. He used Rogers' figure-four leg lock as his finisher. That year, he also won a tournament for the vacant NWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship in Toronto by defeating Gene Kiniski, Ken Patera and then Greg Valentine in the final round. He fought both NWA world champion Harley Race and AWA world champion Nick Bockwinkel in separate matches in Toronto. Each match went to a draw. He later lost the Canadian title to the Great Hossien AKA the Iron Sheik. He was offered a contract as NWA World heavyweight champion, but the NWA had concerns over his drinking habits.\nInto 1980 he traveled between Ontario and Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, where he continued to wrestle as a tag team competitor. He won the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship by teaming with George Wells to defeat The Sheepherders on December 12, 1980. The pair held the belts for almost two months before dropping it to Genichiro Tenryu and Mr. Fuji in February 1981. Robertson regained the championship later that year, however, by teaming with Johnny Weaver to take the belts from Tenryu and Fuji.\n\nRobertson moved to Central States Wrestling, where he won the majority of his titles. On October 22, 1981, he won the NWA Central States Television Championship with a victory over Gene Lewis. He lost the belt to Oliver Humperdink later that year but soon regained it in a rematch. On February 18, 1982, however, he dropped the belt back to Lewis. This allowed Robertson to focus on the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship, which he won a total of five times. His first reign came in October 1981 when he teamed with Rufus R. Jones to defeat Buzz Tyler and James J. Dillon. His next reign came in March 1982 when he teamed with Steve Regal to win the belts from Roger Kirby and Jerry Valiant. The title changed hands twice more that month, as Kirby and Valiant quickly regained the title only to drop it back to Robertson and Regal. Two months later, Kirby and Valiant won the belts back again. Robertson found a new partner, however, and won the championship by teaming with Hercules Hernandez in August. The reign lasted less than a month, but Robertson and Hernandez held the belts one final time after another victory in September 1982. The following year, Robertson's main success came as a singles wrestler. On February 10, 1983, he won the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship with a victory over Manny Fernandez. He lost the belt to Bob Brown two months later but regained it in a rematch the following week. Robertson's final title reign ended when he dropped the title to Race on June 2, 1983.\n\nIn 1983, he changed his look and became \"Max, the Missing Link\" in Mid-South Wrestling with a gimmick of looking and acting bizarre. He later went to World Class Championship Wrestling under Skandor Akbar's Devastation Inc. stable simply called \"The Missing Link\" and feuded with the Von Erichs and The Fabulous Freebirds. He later wrestled in Championship Wrestling from Florida for a short stint and feuded with Bugsy McGraw.\n\nA full-page photo of The Missing Link appeared in the April 29, 1985, issue of \"Sports Illustrated\", which had Hulk Hogan on the cover and reported on Vince McMahon's aggressive strategy to take his World Wrestling Federation national. Two weeks later, The Missing Link made his WWF debut on May 20, 1985, in Madison Square Garden; he was accompanied to the ring by manager Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan and defeated S.D. Jones in less than two minutes. During his brief run in the WWF, most of his matches were against jobbers. Many times, he defeated S.D. Jones, George Wells, Rick McGraw, Salvatore Bellomo, Tony Garea, Jose Luis Rivera, Lanny Poffo, and Swede Hanson. However, he typically lost when matched against bigger stars. His first recorded loss in the WWF came on July 22, 1985, at the Nassau Coliseum, against George \"The Animal\" Steele. On July 24, in Buffalo, New York, he lost to Bruno Sammartino by countout. During this match, he busted several of the chairs in which the ringside commissioners were sitting and the incident almost had the WWF banned from the city. On August 18, he was pinned by Intercontinental Champion Tito Santana at the first-ever WWF show in Tampa, Florida. He also lost matches to Ivan Putski, Tony Atlas, and B. Brian Blair.\n\nWhile in the WWF, he fought Mad Dog Vachon three times: a draw at the Met Center in Minneapolis (August 25); a win by countout in Milwaukee (September 5); and a loss in Denver (September 20). In September 1985, Heenan traded The Missing Link and Adrian Adonis to manager Jimmy Hart in exchange for King Kong Bundy. In his final televised match on WWF Prime Time Wrestling on November 12 (taped October 12 at the Boston Garden), Paul Orndorff pinned The Missing Link in less than five minutes with a high knee after the Link was distracted by his manager, Jimmy Hart, shouting into his megaphone on the ring apron; this was a $50,000 bounty match (Heenan would have paid the Link the bounty if the Link had put Orndorff out of action). He abruptly left the WWF in October 1985 due to drug issues.\n\nIn November 1985, he went to World Class Championship Wrestling and was first managed by Percy Pringle only to turn face after saving Sunshine from an attack from The Great Kabuki then again from Percy Pringle and Rick Rude. In late 1986, he left for the Universal Wrestling Federation where he was managed by Dark Journey. He would later return to World Class and wrestle in World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico. He retired in the 1990s, but returned on the independent circuit as The Missing Link in 2004. He notably wrestled his son Jason Sterling and Edge. His last match was against Al Jihad in Buffalo, NY on May 5, 2007.\n\nRobertson`s parents Ethel and Kenneth divorced in 1954. He attended Westdale High School in Hamilton. As a teen he worked at a golf course in Hamilton. He later worked various jobs from salesman, steelworker and even an arena manager. Robertson's sons, Jason and Mark, were also professional wrestlers. He was married to Gail Stirling for many years but they divorced in 1995. According to Bill Mercer, while married they lived in a naturist community. From the late 1970s to his death, he battled substance abuse. For a few months, he and his wife were homeless until they received help from fellow wrestler Gene Anderson.\n\nHe admitted to taking steroids and abusing alcohol during his career. In 2006, his autobiography \"Bang Your Head: The Real Story of The Missing Link\" was published by ECW Press. In it, he discussed his addiction to steroids, alcohol, and drugs. He also did lectures in schools and prisons on substance abuse. He was a close friend of Ted DiBiase. at that stage and received help from a Christian group in Ontario. He also served on the governor general`s panel on substance abuse. He also was a court constable in the Hamilton court system.\n\nRobertson died on August 16, 2007, after a long battle with lung cancer.\n\n\n"}

It is from and is situated between and .\n\nThe station was designed by the architect James Robb Scott and opened on 10 July 1927 to cater for the increasing local population. The opening of the Vickers aircraft factory in 1911 led to Byfleet's population doubling in just ten years. Many new houses were built to accommodate the factory workers.\nThe station was originally called \"West Weybridge\" and changed to its present name in June 1962.\n\nIt is on a section of railway that forms part of the South Western Main Line's original form, the London and Southampton Railway, which was built in stages. The first stage opened in May 1838 and joined the London Terminus in Nine Elms with Woking Common, now Woking.\n\nByfleet and New Haw Station is in close proximity to the historical Brooklands racetrack and aerodrome, which date back to 1907. The racetrack hosted the 1927 British Grand Prix a few months after the station opened.\n\nVideo - Steam trains at \"West Weybridge\" in 1946\n\nAt off-peak times there are two trains per hour north and two trains per hour south. Currently the services to Woking are usually at 00 and 30 minutes past the hour and those to London at 10 and 40 minutes past the hour. The station has two platforms and is predominantly served by stopping trains on the Woking to London Waterloo via Surbiton service. At peak times there are three or four trains an hour to London Waterloo. On Sundays and late evenings/early mornings there is an additional service to Waterloo via Staines.\nAs Byfleet and New Haw is one of the earlier stops on the Waterloo line, passengers getting on here stand a very good chance of getting a seat. Access for disabled passengers is difficult as passengers travelling in either direction need to negotiate a long staircase. There is no wheelchair access.\nByfleet and New Haw's ticket office is staffed on a part-time basis but has no platform staff. There is an automated ticket machine at the bottom of the first staircase.\n\nContrary to information on the National Rail website, Byfleet and New Haw has a car park although space is limited and it is difficult to get a space after morning rush hour. There is an obsolete pay and display machine within the car park, which appears to have been out of use for many years. One day parking is still advertised at 100p (£1).\n\nIn March 2013, work began to refurbish the booking hall, subway and stairwells at the station. Works were completed in August 2013.\n"}

Greig\n\nCanon (Colonel) John Glennie Greig (24 October 1871, Mhow, India – 24 May 1958, Milford on Sea, Hampshire) was an Englishman who played most of his cricket in India.\n\nBorn in Mhow near Indore in 1871, he lived in India till 1921. In his time, he was the finest batsman to play for the Europeans in the annual Bombay Presidency (later Pentangular) tournaments. He possessed a slight physique but strong wrists and was a useful right arm slow bowler. In India, he was affectionately called \"Jungly\" Greig. He was promoted Captain 19 November 1901, and later became ADC to the Governor of Bombay.\n\nGreig made his first-class debut for the Europeans against the Parsis in the Bombay Presidency match of 1893/4. In the next year, he carried his bat for 79* out of 190 against the same opponents. His 184 five years later was the highest ever individual score made in India and in 1898 in Poona, he took 13 for 58 against the Parsis.\n\nAgainst the touring Oxford Authentics in 1902 he scored 204, the first double hundred made on Indian soil. In December 1915 in a match styled India v England, he hit 216 which resulted in a win of an innings and 263 runs for England. Greig served as a selector when the All India side was chosen for their first official tour to England in 1911.\n\nAt Hampshire, he was a player, secretary and the president. He first represented them in 1901 when he was on leave from the army. The highest of his ten Hampshire hundreds was a 249* against Lancashire at Liverpool in 1901. He began the 1905 season with a century in each innings against Worcestershire and 66 against the Australians. But he was injured midway through his innings of 187 in the return match against Worcestershire and played little cricket thereafter in the season. With 804 at 50.25, he finished fifth in the averages.\n\nHis last game for Hampshire was in 1921 when he became the secretary of the county cricket club. He served in that position till 1930 and became the president in 1945 and 1946.\n\nGreig came to India as a captain in the army. By the time returned he had become a colonel. He later became a Roman Catholic and was ordained as a priest in 1935. In 1947, he was made an honorary canon of the diocese of Portsmouth. Cricket historian Vasant Raiji considers his contributions to Indian cricket as of a same class as that of Ranji to English cricket.\n\n"}
{"id": "2246132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246132", "title": "Onychomycosis", "text": "Onychomycosis\n\nOnychomycosis, also known as tinea unguium, is a fungal infection of the nail. Symptoms may include white or yellow nail discoloration, thickening of the nail, and separation of the nail from the nail bed. Toenails or fingernails may be affected, but it is more common for toenails to be affected. Complications may include cellulitis of the lower leg.\n\nA number of different types of fungus can cause onychomycosis including dermatophytes and \"Fusarium\". Risk factors include athlete's foot, other nail diseases, exposure to someone with the condition, peripheral vascular disease, and poor immune function. The diagnosis is generally suspected based on the appearance and confirmed by laboratory testing.\nOnychomycosis does not necessarily require treatment. The antifungal medication, terbinafine, taken by mouth appears to be the most effective but is associated with liver problems. Trimming the affected nails when on treatment also appears useful. There is a ciclopirox-containing nail polish, but it does not work as well. The condition returns in up to half of cases following treatment. Not using old shoes after treatment may decrease the risk of recurrence.\nIt occurs in about 10 percent of the adult population. Older people are more frequently affected. Males are affected more often than females. Onychomycosis represents about half of nail disease. It was first determined to be the result of a fungal infection in 1853 by Georg Meissner.\n\nThe most common symptom of a fungal nail infection is the nail becoming thickened and discoloured: white, black, yellow or green. As the infection progresses the nail can become brittle, with pieces breaking off or coming away from the toe or finger completely. If left untreated, the skin underneath and around the nail can become inflamed and painful. There may also be white or yellow patches on the nailbed or scaly skin next to the nail, and a foul smell. There is usually no pain or other bodily symptoms, unless the disease is severe. People with onychomycosis may experience significant psychosocial problems due to the appearance of the nail, particularly when fingers – which are always visible – rather than toenails are affected.\nDermatophytids are fungus-free skin lesions that sometimes form as a result of a fungus infection in another part of the body. This could take the form of a rash or itch in an area of the body that is not infected with the fungus. Dermatophytids can be thought of as an allergic reaction to the fungus.\n\nThe causative pathogens of onychomycosis are all in the fungus kingdom and include dermatophytes, \"Candida\" (yeasts), and nondermatophytic molds. Dermatophytes are the fungi most commonly responsible for onychomycosis in the temperate western countries; while \"Candida\" and nondermatophytic molds are more frequently involved in the tropics and subtropics with a hot and humid climate.\n\nWhen onychomycosis is due to a dermatophyte infection, it is termed tinea unguium. \"Trichophyton rubrum\" is the most common dermatophyte involved in onychomycosis. Other dermatophytes that may be involved are \"T. interdigitale\", \"Epidermophyton floccosum\", \"T. violaceum\", \"Microsporum gypseum\", \"T. tonsurans\", and \"T. soudanense\". A common outdated name that may still be reported by medical laboratories is \"Trichophyton mentagrophytes\" for \"T. interdigitale\". The name \"T. mentagrophytes\" is now restricted to the agent of favus skin infection of the mouse; though this fungus may be transmitted from mice and their danders to humans, it generally infects skin and not nails.\n\nOther causative pathogens include \"Candida\" and nondermatophytic molds, in particular members of the mold genus \"Scytalidium\" (name recently changed to \"Neoscytalidium\"), \"Scopulariopsis\", and \"Aspergillus\".\n\"Candida\" species mainly cause fingernail onychomycosis in people whose hands are often submerged in water. \"Scytalidium\" mainly affects people in the tropics, though it persists if they later move to areas of temperate climate.\n\nOther molds more commonly affect people older than 60 years, and their presence in the nail reflects a slight weakening in the nail's ability to defend itself against fungal invasion.\n\nAging is the most common risk factor for onychomycosis due to diminished blood circulation, longer exposure to fungi, and nails which grow more slowly and thicken, increasing susceptibility to infection. Nail fungus tends to affect men more often than women, and is associated with a family history of this infection.\n\nOther risk factors include perspiring heavily, being in a humid or moist environment, psoriasis, wearing socks and shoes that hinder ventilation and do not absorb perspiration, going barefoot in damp public places such as swimming pools, gyms and shower rooms, having athlete's foot (tinea pedis), minor skin or nail injury, damaged nail, or other infection, and having diabetes, circulation problems, which may also lead to lower peripheral temperatures on hands and feet, or a weakened immune system.\n\nThe diagnosis is generally suspected based on the appearance and confirmed by laboratory testing. The four main tests are a potassium hydroxide smear, culture, histology examination, and polymerase chain reaction. The sample examined is generally nail scrapings or clippings. These being from as far up the nail as possible.\n\nNail plate biopsy with periodic acid-Schiff stain appear more useful than culture or direct KOH examination. To reliably identify nondermatophyte molds, several samples may be necessary.\n\nThere are four classic types of onychomycosis:\n\nIn many cases of suspected nail fungus there is actually no fungal infection, but only nail deformity.\n\nTo avoid misdiagnosis as nail psoriasis, lichen planus, contact dermatitis, nail bed tumors such as melanoma, trauma, or yellow nail syndrome, laboratory confirmation may be necessary.\n\nOther conditions that may appear similar to onychomycosis include: psoriasis, normal aging, yellow nail syndrome, and chronic paronychia.\n\nMost treatments are with antifungal medications either topically or by mouth. Avoiding use of antifungal therapy by mouth (e.g. terbinafine) in persons without a confirmed infection is recommended because of the possible side effects of that treatment.\n\nTopical agents include ciclopirox nail paint, amorolfine, and efinaconazole. Some topical treatments need to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least 1 year). Topical amorolfine is applied weekly. Topical ciclopirox results in a cure in 6% to 9% of cases; amorolfine might be more effective. Ciclopirox when used with terbinafine appears to be better than either agent alone. In trials about 17% of people using efinaconazole while cure was seen in 4% of people using placebo.\n\nMedications that may be taken by mouth include terbinafine (76% effective), itraconazole (60% effective) and fluconazole (48% effective). They share characteristics that enhance their effectiveness: prompt penetration of the nail and nail bed, and persistence in the nail for months after discontinuation of therapy. Ketoconazole by mouth is not recommended due to side effects. Oral terbinafine is better tolerated than itraconazole. For superficial white onychomycosis, systemic rather than topical antifungal therapy is advised.\n\nChemical (keratolytic) or surgical debridement of the affected nail appears to improve outcomes.\n\nAs of 2014 evidence for laser treatment is unclear as the evidence is of low quality and varies by type of laser.\n\nTea tree oil is not recommended as a treatment, since it is not effective and can irritate the surrounding skin.\n\nAccording to a 2015 study, the cost in the United States of testing with the periodic acid–Schiff stain (PAS) was about $148. Even if the cheaper KOH test is used first and the PAS test is used only if the KOH test is negative, there is a good chance that the PAS will be done (because of either a true or a false negative with the KOH test). But the terbinafine treatment costs only $10 (plus an additional $43 for liver function tests). In conclusion the authors say that terbinafine has a relatively benign adverse effect profile, with liver damage very rare, so it makes more sense cost-wise for the dermatologist to prescribe the treatment without doing the PAS test. (Another option would be to prescribe the treatment only if the potassium hydroxide test is positive, but it gives a false negative in about 20% of cases of fungal infection.) On the other hand, as of 2015 the price of topical (non-oral) treatment with efinaconazole was $2307 per nail, so testing is recommended before prescribing it.\n\nFollowing effective treatment, recurrence is common (10–50%). Nail fungus can be painful and cause permanent damage to nails. It may lead to other serious infections if the immune system is suppressed due to medication, diabetes or other conditions. The risk is most serious for people with diabetes and with immune systems weakened by leukemia or AIDS, or medication after organ transplant. Diabetics have vascular and nerve impairment, and are at risk of cellulitis, a potentially serious bacterial infection; any relatively minor injury to feet, including a nail fungal infection, can lead to more serious complications. Infection of the bone is another rare complication.\n\nA 2003 survey of diseases of the foot in 16 European countries found onychomycosis to be the most frequent fungal foot infection and estimates its prevalence at 27%. Prevalence was observed to increase with age. In Canada, the prevalence was estimated to be 6.48%. Onychomycosis affects approximately one-third of diabetics and is 56% more frequent in people suffering from psoriasis.\n\nThe term is from Greek ' \"nail\", ' \"fungus\", and the suffix \"-ōsis\" \"functional disease\".\n\nResearch suggests that fungi are sensitive to heat, typically . The basis of laser treatment is to try to heat the nail bed to these temperatures in order to disrupt fungal growth. As of 2013 research into laser treatment seems promising. There is also ongoing development in photodynamic therapy, which uses laser or LED light to activate photosensitisers that eradicate fungi.\n"}
{"id": "2246136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246136", "title": "Flip-disc display", "text": "Flip-disc display\n\nThe flip-disc display (or flip-dot display) is an electromechanical dot matrix display technology used for large outdoor signs, normally those that will be exposed to direct sunlight. Flip-disc technology has been used for destination signs in buses across North America, Europe and Australia, as well as for variable-message signs on highways. It has also been used extensively on public information displays. A few game shows have also used flip-disc displays, including Canadian shows like \"Just Like Mom\", \"The Joke's on Us\" and \"Uh Oh!\", but most notably the American game show \"Family Feud\" from 1976 to 1995 and its British version \"Family Fortunes\" from 1980 to 2003.\n\nThe flip-disc display consists of a grid of small metal discs that are black on one side and a bright color on the other (typically white or day-glo yellow), set into a black background. With power applied, the disc flips to show the other side. Once flipped, the discs will remain in position without power.\n\nThe disc is attached to an axle which also carries a small permanent magnet. Positioned close to the magnet is a solenoid. By pulsing the solenoid coil with the appropriate electrical polarity, the permanent magnet on the axle will align itself with the magnetic field, also turning the disc. Another style uses a magnet embedded in the disc itself, with separate solenoids arranged at the ends or side to flip it.\n\nA computerized driver system reads data, typically characters, and flips the appropriate discs to produce the desired display. Some displays use the other end of the solenoid to actuate a reed switch, which controls an LED array behind the disc, resulting in a display that is visible at night but requires no extra drive electronics.\n\nVarious driving schemes are in use. Their basic purpose is to reduce the amount of wiring and electronics needed to drive the solenoids. All common methods connect the solenoids in some sort of matrix. One driving method is similar to that of core memory: the solenoids are connected in a simple matrix. Those solenoids at the crossing point of two powered wires are driven with enough current to flip their discs; those powered on only the vertical or horizontal line see only 1/2 of the required force (as flux is proportional to current, which in turn is proportional to the voltage). Those on unpowered lines also do not flip.\n\nTypically, the driving scheme works its way from top to bottom, powering each horizontal line \"on\" and then powering the needed vertical lines to set up that row. The whole process takes a few seconds, during which time the sound of the discs being flipped over is quite distinctive.\n\nOther driving schemes use diodes to isolate non-driven solenoids, which allows only the discs whose state need changing to be flipped. This uses less power, and may be more robust.\n\nThe flip-disc display was developed by Kenyon Taylor at Ferranti-Packard at the request of Trans-Canada Airlines (today's Air Canada). By the time the system had been patented in 1961, TCA had already lost interest and Ferranti's management didn't consider the project very interesting.\n\nThe first big opportunity for this system came in 1961 when the Montreal Stock Exchange decided to modernize its method of displaying trading information. Ferranti-Packard and Westinghouse both bid on the project, Westinghouse using an electro-luminescent technology. Ferranti won the contract after demonstrating the system with a mock-up they built in a disused warehouse across the street from the exchange's new offices, using hand-painted dots moved by hand to show how the system would work. The dots were slowly replaced with operating modules as they became available. The $700,000 system () was beset by delays and technical problems, but once it became fully operational it was considered very reliable.\n\nThe systems were relatively expensive because of their manual construction, typically completed by women who \"sewed\" the displays in a fashion very similar to the construction of core memory. Worse, Ferranti signed maintenance contracts that were, by 1971, losing $12,000 a month. A re-organization of the engineering and maintenance department addressed the problems, and prices started to fall. By 1977 the system had won sales with half the world's major stock exchanges.\n\nAs prices fell, they were soon found in wider roles, notably that of highway signs and information systems for public transport. In Europe and in the US, vane displays based on the same technology became popular for displaying prices at gasoline stations. In 1974 Ferranti started a project to build smaller versions for the front of buses and trains, and by 1977 revenue from these had already surpassed that from other lines of business. The displays often required minor maintenance to free up \"stuck\" discs.\n\nFlip-disc systems are still widespread but are not often found in new installations. Their place has been filled by LED-based products, which use a small amount of power constantly rather than each time the message changes, but are easily visible in light and darkness and, having no moving parts, require little maintenance.\n\nSome producers offer combined displays which use flip-dot and LED technologies together (every dot-disc has its own LED) and thereby they combine their advantages. For example, the Czech company BUSE from Blansko supplies self-patented DOT-LED displays (only DOT and only LED as well) in Central and East Europe. This combined technology was used for outside displays of most of new buses and trams.\n\n"}

During the last phase of British rule in India, he worked with the Congress Radio which was broadcast secretly from various places in Bombay until 1942. Lohia lost to Nehru in 1962 general election, but entered Lok Sabha in 1963 by winning a by-poll. \n\nRam Manohar Lohia was born on 23 March 1910 at Akbarpur, currently part of the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. His family was prosperous Vaishyas.\n\nLohia wrote his Ph.D thesis paper on the topic of \"Salt Taxation in India\", focusing on Gandhi's socio-economic theory.\n\nLohia was one of the founders of the Congress Socialist Party and editor of its mouthpiece \"Congress Socialist\". In 1936, he was selected by Jawaharlal Nehru as the secretary of the Foreign Department of the All India Congress Committee (A.I.C.C), the highest body of the Congress Party. By the time he quit that responsibility in 1938, Lohia started to develop his own political standpoint by critically examining positions held by the Gandhian leadership of the Congress and the Communists who had poured into the CSP. In June 1940, he was arrested and sentenced to a jail term of two years for delivering anti-war speeches. Already released by the end of 1941, Lohia became one of the leading figures of the Central Directorate which clandestinely tried to organise the Quit India revolt, sparked by Gandhi in August 1942. Captured in May 1944, he was incarcerated and tortured in Lahore Fort. As one of the last high security prisoners, Lohia, together with Jayaprakash Narayan, was finally released on 11 April 1946.\n\nAs a member of the Congress Socialist Party Lohia joined with that party when it left Congress. He remained a member of the Socialist Party when it fused in 1952 with the Kisan Majdoor Praja Party to form the Praja Socialist Party. Unhappy with the new party Lohia led a split from it to reform the Socialist Party (Lohia) in 1956. He lost to Nehru in 1962 general election. In 1963 Lohia became a member of the Lok Sabha after a by-election in Farrukhabad (Lok Sabha constituency) and in 1965 merged the Socialist Party (Lohia) into the ranks of the Samyukta Socialist Party. The two socialist factions merged, split and re-merged several times. He won Lok Sabha general election of 1967 from Kannauj (Lok Sabha constituency). \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in the central area of the Iberian Peninsula at an altitude of 604 metres, 20 kilometres south of Madrid, and covers 62.7 square kilometres. In 2018, Pinto had a population of 51,541. It is home to the Torre de Pinto, the Pinto Castle, and the Éboli Tower, which is a 14th-century tower used as a prison for nobles who fell out of favor with the king. \n\nAccording to local tradition, the name Pinto sprung from the Moorish \"Legend of the Ark\", which cited the area as the \"geographical centre of the Iberian Peninsula.\" According to this legend, the Moors carried out measurements that located the central point of the peninsula in the ravine of the Egido de Pinto, in what is now the confluence of the streets of the hospital and the Master María del Rosario (Calle del Arca, until 1935). There, under a circular stone marked with an X, they deposited the instruments used for these measurements in an 'ark'.\n\nThere is also a hypothesis that suggests a Roman origin of the name, with \"Punctum\" (Latin: way-point or cross-roads) indicating the meeting of five roads. The word may have changed to \"Punto\", then to the current name, Pinto.\n\nIt is not known exactly when the first inhabitants arrived in the area, although the oldest remains are in the Cuniebles Cave, with other settlements on the banks of the Prados and Culebro rivers, in the vicinity of the cave. In total, five sites from different periods have been found in the municipality: paleolithic, chalcolithic, Iron Age and from Roman and Visigoth occupations (the latter of which appears to include re-purposed Roman buildings).\n\nDuring Moorish rule, between 711 and 1083, Pinto was a colony of Getafe called Xata, which was subsequently conquered by Alfonso VI in his advance through Toledo.\n\nThe town title was granted in 1359 by the King of Castile, Peter I, also known as Peter the Cruel.\n\nThe coat of arms was formally approved on 13 September 2007, and it has these blazons:\n\"\"Jaquelado de quince escaques, ocho de oro y siete de gules, cargado con la figura de un globo terráqueo de azur, con los continentes en oro y un punto de gules en el centro de la península ibérica. Al timbre corona real de España.\"\"\n\n\"\"Chequered with fifteen squares, eight of gold and seven of red, plated with a figure of a blue globe, with the continents in gold and a point of red in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. Topped with the Spanish crown.\"\"\nPinto has a typical Castilian plateau landscape, with heavy urban expansion due to its proximity to the capital. The Arroyo de los Prados is a stream that passes through the village that was first cultivated in 1967. It is a tributary of the Arroyo Culebro, which also runs through the village, creating the border between Pinto and Getafe.\n\nThe area is also subject to flooding that occurs as a result of the Arroyo de los Prados rising.\n\nIn the southwest of the town lies the last remaining wetland of the municipality, Los Estragales, where up to 130 different types of birds have been identified.\n\n\nPinto has a Mediterranean climate with hot summers that can reach up to 40 °C and cold winters that can drop below 0 °C. Rainfall is scarce, with approximately 450 mm of precipitation annually, with autumn and spring being the rainiest seasons. Snowfalls, which, in the past, were relatively abundant, now occur infrequently.\n\nAccording to the 2018 census, the total population of Pinto had risen to 51,541 inhabitants.\n\nMayors\n\nIn 1979, with the arrival of democracy, Carlos Penit, the head of the regional Communist Party of Spain (PCE), became the first mayor of Pinto, and was reelected in 1983, 1987, and 1991.\n\nIn 1993, Gloria Razábal was elected by the municipal council, making her the first female mayor of Pinto.\n\nIn 1995, Antonio Fernández, leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), became the mayor by a margin of 25 votes. He was reelected in the years 1999 and 2003 with a majority. Due to accusations of corruption, he resigned in 2005, and Juan Tendero became mayor.\n\nPinto was considered a left-wing enclave until 2007 when the conservative Popular Party (PP) put itself within 3 points of the governing PSOE. After managing to double its share of votes from 21% to 42% in the prior four years, PP was then able to go into coalition with \"Juntos por Pinto\" (Together for Pinto; JpP) to govern with a stable majority and proclaim Miriam Rabaneda as the mayor of Pinto.\nThe legislature was full of political tension. A councillor from Juntos por Pinto, Reyes Maestre, changed his mind concerning a motor space project, supporting its construction. This provoked a crisis within the PP-JpP government. On December 22, 2008, a motion of censure was presented by PSOE/IU/JpP against the Popular Party and PSOE member Juan José Martín Nieto was proclaimed as the new mayor, obtaining a majority in the municipal council. The political tension in Pinto was constant. In February 2010, the former mayor Miriam Rabaneda and her sister Tamara Rabaneda, former councillor of the Treasury, were charged for alleged malfeasance due to irregularities in the municipal accounts. The case was subsequently dismissed by a court in the town of Parla. In October 2010, Reyes Maestre was terminated as deputy mayor by the mayor of Pinto.\n\nIn the municipal elections on 22 May 2011, the Popular Party won another majority and Miriam Rabaneda reclaimed the mayoralty of the municipality from Juan José Martín Nieto. These elections led to the emergence of the UPyD party in Pinto, which won two seats, thus becoming a new political force represented in the City Council. The electorate punished Juntos por Pinto\",\" then headed by Reyes Mastre, as well as the United Left party (IU), which gained no representation.\n\nIn 2015, the municipal elections held that no party had managed to obtain an absolute majority, with UPyD losing both of its seats. In these elections, the party Ganemos Pinto (a coalition between several minor parties, including \"Podemos)\" gained seven seats alongside PP, PSOE, which gained five, and Ciudadanos with two. An alliance between \"Ganemos Pinto\" and PSOE gained Rafael Sánchez Romero the mayoralty.\n\n\n\n"}

It was widely expected that he would succeed his father as President of Syria until he died in a car accident in 1994.\n\nBassel al-Assad was born on 23 March 1962. He was trained as a civil engineer, and he held a PhD in military sciences.\n\nTrained in parachuting, he was commissioned in the Special Forces and later switched to the armoured corps after training in the Soviet Military Academies. He rapidly progressed through the ranks, becoming a major and then commander of a brigade in the Republican Guard.\n\nAfter his father recovered from a serious illness in 1984, Bassel began to accompany him and he emerged on the national scene in 1987, when he won several equestrian medals at a regional tournament. The Ba'ath Party press in Syria eulogised him as the \"Golden Knight\" because of his prowess on horseback. He also had a reputation for an interest in fast cars, and his friends described him as charismatic and commanding. Assad was soon appointed Head of Presidential Security. In addition, he launched the Syrian Computer Society in 1989, which was later headed by Bashar.\n\nOriginally Assad's uncle, Rifaat al-Assad, was Hafez's chosen successor but Rifaat attempted to usurp power from Hafez while the latter was in a coma in 1984. This led to Rifaat's exile. Following the incident, Bassel was groomed to succeed his father. Hafez's efforts intensified to make Bassel the next President of Syria in the early 1990s; after Hafez's election victory in 1991, the President was publicly referred to as \"Abu Basil\" (Father of Bassel). Assad was also being introduced to European and Arab leaders; he was a close friend of the children of King Hussein of Jordan and had been also introduced to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.\n\nAssad had a significant role in Lebanese affairs, and was known to Lebanese leaders of all sects. He organised a highly publicised anti-corruption campaign within the government and frequently appeared in full military uniform at official receptions to signal the government's commitment to the armed forces.\n\nFormer CIA director Michael Hayden has compared Bassel to Sonny in the novel \"The Godfather\". \"There is no doubt the Assads, along with the Makhloufs who are tied to them in bonds of marriage and partnerships, were just as busy with crime and committing particularly cruel acts as they were with ruling over Syria.\"\n\nBassel is said to have spoken French and Russian fluently. According to leaked United States diplomatic cables, he had a relationship with a Lebanese woman, Siham Asseily who later married Lebanese journalist and deputy Gebran Tueni.\n\nOn 21 January 1994, while he was driving his Mercedes at a high speed through fog to Damascus International Airport for a flight to Germany in the early hours of the morning, Bassel collided with a barrier and, not wearing a seatbelt, died instantly. Hafez Makhlouf was with him and was hospitalized with injuries after the accident, and a chauffeur in the back seat was unhurt.\n\nAssad's body was taken to Al Assad University Hospital and then buried in Qardaha, where his father's body was also later buried.\n\nAfter his death, shops, schools and public offices in Syria closed for three days, and luxury hotels suspended the sale of alcohol in respect. He was elevated by the state into \"the martyr of the country, the martyr of the nation and the symbol for its youth\".\n\nA great number of squares and streets were named after him. The new international swimming complex, various hospitals, sporting clubs and a military academy were named after him. The international airport in Latakia was named after him, Bassel Al-Assad International Airport. His statue is found in several Syrian cities, and even after his death, he is often pictured on billboards with his father and brother.\n\nBassel Assad's death led to his lesser-known brother Bashar al-Assad, who was then undertaking postgraduate training in ophthalmology in London, assuming the mantle of president-in-waiting. Bashar became President following the death of his father, on 10 June 2000. Bassel Assad's posters and his name were also used to secure a smooth transition after Hafez Assad introduced the slogan \"[Bassel], the Example: [Bashar], the Future.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2246167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246167", "title": "Pirates of the Mississippi", "text": "Pirates of the Mississippi\n\nPirates of the Mississippi were an American country music band founded in 1987 by Bill McCorvey (lead vocals), Rich Alves (lead guitar), Jimmy Lowe (drums), Pat Severs (steel guitar), and Dean Townson (bass guitar). The group recorded for Capitol Records Nashville from 1990 to 1991, Liberty Records between 1992 and 1994, and Giant Records in 1995, by which point Greg Trostle had replaced Severs. The band also charted nine singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs charts in the first half of the 1990s, the most successful being \"Feed Jake\", which went to number 15 in 1991. After disbanding in 1996, both Alves and McCorvey went on to write songs for other artists. In 2000, the two reunited under the Pirates of the Mississippi name, releasing an additional album titled \"Heaven and a Dixie Night\" before disbanding again.\n\nPirates of the Mississippi was formed in 1987, when Nashville session musicians Bill McCorvey (lead vocals), Rich Alves (lead guitar), Dean Townson (bass guitar), Jimmy Lowe (drums), and Pat Severs (steel guitar) started performing together. Originally, they identified themselves as the We Don't Want a Freaking Record Deal Band, but upon witnessing a group of fans wearing clogs, the group changed its name to The Cloggers.\n\nThe Cloggers began playing various clubs around Nashville. Eventually, they attracted the attention of an artists and repertoire (A&R) at Universal Records, a label then owned by record producer Jimmy Bowen. Executives at the label disliked the band's name, and suggested that they change it. The band then chose the name Pirates of the Mississippi because they thought that Lowe resembled a pirate. The band's debut album was finished by 1988, but its release was delayed until 1990 due to Universal being bought out by Capitol Records. In the meantime, Alves co-wrote the singles \"Time In\" by The Oak Ridge Boys and \"Southern Star\" by Alabama, the latter of which went to No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs charts in early 1990. He and McCorvey also co-wrote \"Karma Road\" for the group Trader-Price (who were also signed to Capitol by way of the Universal merger) on their 1990 debut album.\n\nIn June 1990, the band released its self-titled debut album via Capitol. This album produced four chart singles on the Hot Country Songs charts. First was a cover of Hank Williams's \"Honky Tonk Blues\", which the band took to number 26 on the country charts. Although \"Rollin' Home\" peaked outside the top 40, the album's third single, \"Feed Jake\", became the band's biggest hit at number 15. The song, about a man who reminisces about a childhood friend while discussing societal stereotypes towards homeless people and homosexuals, was interpreted by some fans as having a pro-gay theme. \"Speak of the Devil\", the last single from \"Pirates of the Mississippi\", also made the country top 40. Alves produced the album with James Stroud. In 1991, the band received the Top New Vocal Group award from the Academy of Country Music. Brian Mansfield wrote in Allmusic that the album \"is a cross between Alabama country and Southern rock...There are a few twists, though, namely a Guy Clark song...and a surf-country instrumental.\"\n\n1991's \"Walk the Plank\", their second album for Capitol, was co-produced by Alves and Jimmy Bowen. It included three singles: \"Fighting for You\", \"'Til I'm Holding You Again\", and \"Too Much\" the last of which was written by Clark and Lee Roy Parnell. Respectively, these peaked at 41, 22, and 36 on the country charts. Between the band's first two albums, the members performed all instruments themselves, except for the synthesizer strings on \"Feed Jake\" and \"Fighting for You\", which were performed by John Kelton, also the sound engineer on those albums. Mansfield said of this album that the \"Allman Brothers cops are more exciting than their stone-country material, although that's certainly competent enough. The white-country-soul \"Till I'm Holding You Again\" -- which tries to rock out when you're not looking -- is probably the best of all.\"\n\nAfter a restructuring of Capitol Nashville, the band was transferred to Liberty Records, where they would release their third and fourth albums: \"A Street Man Named Desire\" (1992) and \"Dream You\" (1993). Each album's title track was the only charting single from it: \"A Street Man Named Desire\" peaked at number 56 and \"Dream You\" at number 63, their last single to make the charts. By 1994, a compilation album entitled \"The Best of Pirates of the Mississippi\" was issued. This compilation included several tracks from their first four albums, and newly recorded remixes. In 1995, the band signed to Warner Bros. Records subsidiary Giant Records, releasing the non-charting singles \"You Could Do Better\" and \"Sure Sign\", which were to have been included on an album also titled \"Sure Sign\". Also at this point, Pat Severs left the group and was replaced by Greg Trostle, who had previously played steel guitar on Lionel Cartwright's \"Chasin' the Sun\".\n\nLater in 1995, the band released \"Paradise\", its only physical album for Giant. By this point, Trostle had left the band as well, and several session musicians performed on the album, including guitarist Dann Huff, pianist Johnny Neel, and backing vocalists John Wesley Ryles and Curtis Wright. David Malloy produced the album, collaborating with Stroud on seven of the ten tracks. Despite producing no chart singles, this album's title track would later be a Top 40 hit for John Anderson that year, from an album which was also titled \"Paradise\" and produced by Stroud. Pirates of the Mississippi disbanded in 1996, after their last concert at the county fair in Isle of Wight County, Virginia. After the band broke up, McCorvey co-wrote \"Lonely and Gone\", a Top 5 hit for Montgomery Gentry in 1999, and \"I'm Not Gonna Do Anything Without You\", a duet between Mark Wills and Jamie O'Neal in 2001, while Alves wrote album cuts for Chad Brock, Rascal Flatts, Guy Clark, and The Oak Ridge Boys.\n\nIn 2000, Rich Alves and Bill McCorvey decided to reunite as a duo, again assuming the name Pirates of the Mississippi. Three years later, in 2003, original steel guitarist Pat Severs joined the house band on \"Nashville Star\", a talent show which originally aired on the USA Networks before transferring to NBC in 2008. Alves and McCorvey were signed to CBuJ Entertainment/Evergreen Records in 2006, releasing the album \"Heaven and a Dixie Night\" that year. McCorvey founded an acoustic trio called Buffalo Rome, with which he performed from 2005 to 2010, before retiring from music to open a liquor store in Brentwood, Tennessee. Original bass guitarist Dean Townson died of unknown causes on March 25, 2010, at the age of 50. Original drummer Jimmy Lowe returned to civilian life as a software engineer in 1996, and has also been a member of longtime Nashville band The Chessmen since 2012.\n\n"}

As a left back, Powell played for Southend United, Derby County, Charlton Athletic, West Ham United and Leicester City. He also made five appearances for the England national team.\n\nWith Charlton he had three spells as a player over eight seasons and in the 1999–2000 season was part of the squad that won the First Division to be promoted to the Premier League.\n\nAfter finishing his playing career at Leicester in 2010, Powell became first team coach. He then returned to Charlton Athletic as manager. In the 2011–12 season, Charlton were promoted to the Championship as League One champions in Powell's first full season as a manager. He has also managed Huddersfield Town from 2014 to 2015. He was assistant manager at Derby County from 2016 to 2017, including a spell as caretaker manager. He then managed Southend United from January 2018 to March 2019.\n\nPowell served as chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association from November 2005 until he retired. In October 2009 Powell was named as one of 50 ambassadors for England's 2018 World Cup bid.\n\nAfter leaving Raynes Park High School, Powell spent the 1985–86 season playing for the Epsom & Ewell youth team alongside a young Matt Elliott. He began his professional career in December 1987 as a trainee at Crystal Palace with Ian Wright but failed to become a regular with the first team. He spent time on loan at Aldershot, where he made 11 appearances.\n\nIn August 1990, Powell moved on a free transfer to Essex club Southend United.\nIn six years at the club Powell made 288 first-team appearances. In November 2004 a BBC poll of Southend United supporters voted Powell their all-time cult hero. One fan described him as \"A very skilled, left-footed defender, who could quite possibly be considered one of the nicest men in football, a true gent.\"\n\nIn January 1996 Powell moved to Derby County for a fee of £750,000. He made 99 first-team appearances before being transferred to Charlton Athletic in June 1998 for a fee of £825,000. Powell was a favourite of the Derby fans, and won the Supporters' Player of the Year award for the 1996–97 season. He scored twice during his spell at Derby, with both goals coming in the 1997–98 season: against Everton in the league and Southampton in the FA Cup.\n\nWhile at Charlton, he made 200 first-team appearances, and evidently caught the eye of Sven-Göran Eriksson, who picked him for the England team in 2001, at the unusually late age of 31. He was the oldest England debutant since Syd Owen in 1954. At Charlton he delighted the crowds after each home victory with his exuberant leaps of celebration. Powell scored twice during his first spell with the \"Addicks\", with both goals coming against Tottenham Hotspur; once in the league and once in the FA Cup.\n\nShortly after the start of the 2004–05 season, Powell was allowed to move to West Ham United, where he played a major part in their successful promotion campaign. However, during the summer of 2005 he and West Ham were unable to agree terms for a further contract and he returned to Charlton on a one-year contract, with a suggestion that he would develop his coaching skills.\n\nTypically consistent performance belying his years throughout 2005–06 saw Powell regain his place as Charlton's first choice left back, rotated with loanee Jonathan Spector, due to Hermann Hreiðarsson's move to the centre of defence. On 1 July 2006 he signed a one-year contract with Premiership newcomers Watford as Aidy Boothroyd looked to add some experience to his youthful squad. He was released by the club after one year. In July 2007, Powell returned to Charlton for a third spell, primarily as a coach. He made his last appearance for Charlton on 4 May 2008, coming on as substitute for the last five minutes in the final game of the season, against Coventry, and scoring only his third goal for the club to seal a 4–1 victory.\n\nPowell joined League Two side Bournemouth on a trial basis in July 2008. whilst the club looked to see if he could bring much needed experience to their defence. He joined Leicester City on a six-month contract on 23 August 2008.\nHe made his debut against Fulham in Leicester's League Cup second round 3–2 defeat, playing the full 90 minutes.\n\nOn 6 December 2008 Powell started his 750th career appearance against former club Southend; Leicester won the game 3–0. He signed a contract extension that would see him stay at the club until the end of the 2008–09 season on 5 January 2009.\n\nIn July 2009, Powell signed a contract to be a player-coach at Leicester City, becoming first team development coach, and also re-registering himself as a player. With teammates Bruno Berner out with a calf injury and Ryan McGivern struggling with form, Powell played his first league match on 26 January 2010, in a 1–0 defeat to Barnsley. He retired from playing at the end of the 2009–10 season; his final appearance came on 27 March 2010 against his former club Derby County.\n\nHaving served as a player coach under Nigel Pearson, Powell was retained by incoming Leicester manager Paulo Sousa in the summer of 2010. In October, Powell was named caretaker manager with Mike Stowell of the Foxes after Sousa was sacked. Their first, and only, game in charge came against Scunthorpe United; Leicester won the game 3–1. He remained a coach at the club after Sousa's replacement, Sven-Göran Eriksson, was appointed. Eriksson—who selected Powell for his England caps—commented in December 2010 that Powell \"will be a very good manager in the future\".\n\nIn September 2019, Powell was appointed as a coach for the England national football team.\n\nOn 14 January 2011 Powell was appointed manager of Charlton Athletic, who were by now languishing in League One. He signed a three-and-a-half-year contract following the sacking of Phil Parkinson.\n\nHis first signing of his managerial career was Bradley Wright-Phillips, who went on to score on his debut on 1 February 2011, against Colchester United. Powell won his opening four games at Charlton, but then went 11 games without a win, falling out of the play-off places and leaving the Addicks in 13th place at the end of the season.\n\nPowell signed 19 new players in summer 2011, including midfielders Danny Green, Danny Hollands, Dale Stephens, defenders Matt Taylor, Rhoys Wiggins and goalkeeper Ben Hamer. Bradley Pritchard was signed from non-league Hayes & Yeading United Football Club and has excelled in midfield, with Yann Kermorgant forming a formidable strike partnership alongside Wright-Phillips. Captain Johnnie Jackson has been a talisman all season despite numerous injuries, and Chris Solly, a product of the youth academy has made the right back berth his own. Clever loan signings were made throughout the season including Hogan Ephraim, Darel Russell, Dany N'Guessan and the return of Lee Cook. Charlton finished strongly into the second half of the 2011–12 season and sealed promotion back to the Championship as champions of League One. Charlton finished the 2012–13 season in 9th place, ending with a 4–1 victory over already relegated Bristol City and three points off a play-off position.\n\nOn 11 March 2014, Powell was sacked as manager of Charlton Athletic by owner Roland Duchâtelet; this decision came after a poor run of form with the Addicks sitting at the bottom of the Championship table, although media reports have suggested that it was a reluctance to play players Roland Duchâtelet had brought to the club and differences in transfer policy.\n\nOn 3 September 2014, Powell was named the new manager of Huddersfield Town on a rolling contract, following the resignation of Mark Robins after the first game of the season. Ten days later, in his first game in charge at the John Smith's Stadium, Huddersfield lost 1–2 to Middlesbrough: Jon Stead had equalised for Huddersfield with 4 minutes to play but Grant Leadbitter scored the winner with an added-time penalty. In November, Powell took in on loan Diego Poyet, a player whom he had given a professional debut at Charlton. He signed Grant Holt on an emergency loan from Wigan. On 28 December 2014, Holt returned to his parent club after a successful operation on his knee, though it kept him out for nine months. Chris Powell was sacked by Huddersfield Town on 4 November 2015\n\nOn 27 May 2016, Powell was named the new assistant manager of Derby County alongside new manager Nigel Pearson, who had also managed him at Leicester City. On 27 September, Powell was appointed caretaker manager after Pearson was suspended by Derby chairman Mel Morris. On 12 October 2016, Powell reverted to his previous role of assistant manager upon the reappointment of Steve McClaren as manager. Powell left Derby in March 2017 following the sacking of McClaren.\n\nPowell returned to management on 23 January 2018, taking over at Southend United, signing a two-and-a-half-year contract. He is the only permanent Southend United manager to have won his first three matches.\nAfter 11 games without a win and with the club in 20th place in the league, on goal difference off the relegation zone, Powell was sacked as manager of Southend United on 26 March 2019.\n\nIn December 2019 Powell was appointed as assistant coach to Alan Pardew at ADO Den Haag in the Netherlands. Both Pardew and Powell left ADO Den Haag on 28 April 2020 following the premature ending of the 2019–20 Eredivisie due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Correct \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2246187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246187", "title": "Itton", "text": "Itton\n\nItton (), is a small village in Monmouthshire, south-east Wales, in the community of Devauden about north-west of Chepstow. The village covers about a radius, with about 70 properties across a rural area. The parish also includes the hamlet of Howick.\n\nThe church and Itton Court, the manor house, are located about from the main housing development at Itton Common on the B4293 road between Chepstow and Devauden. The woodland between Itton and Devauden is Chepstow Park Wood.\n\nThe Welsh language name for the village derives from the dedication of the parish church to St. Deiniol, a 6th-century bishop. The English name first appears in records in the 13th century, as \"Edyton\", \"Hedyngton\" or \"Edeton\".\n\nThe parish church building itself is Grade II listed building dating in part from the 14th century although it was mostly rebuilt in 1869. The church stands beside Itton Court, originally a mediaeval fortalice of the Lords of Striguil or Chepstow. The fortified manor house was later extended. The eastern front was built for the house's owner, John Jeffries, in the early 18th century. In 1749 the house was bought by John Curre whose family extended it and rebuilt parts, particularly in the late 19th century.\n\nThe Curre Hunt was started in 1896 by Sir Edward Curre of Itton Court. He began by buying foxhounds from the old Chepstow Hunt and building hunt kennels at Itton. The Curre country covers some between Chepstow and Usk and is bordered on the south by the Severn Estuary with the River Wye to the east. The Curre Hunt was well known nationally for their 'All White Pack'. All the foxhounds were bred to be white, although following the fairly recent amalgamation of the Curre and Llangibby hunts this characteristic has largely faded out; many of the dogs are still white but there are some coloured beagle-like dogs too.\n\n"}
{"id": "2246190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246190", "title": "Wolf hunting", "text": "Wolf hunting\n\nWolf hunting is the practice of hunting gray wolves \"(Canis lupus)\" or other species of wolves. Wolves are mainly hunted for sport, for their skins, to protect livestock and, in some rare cases, to protect humans. Wolves have been actively hunted since 8,000 to 10,000 years ago, when they first began to pose a threat to livestock vital for the survival of Neolithic human communities. Historically, the hunting of wolves was a huge capital- and manpower-intensive operation. The threat wolves posed to both livestock and people was considered significant enough to warrant the conscription of whole villages under threat of punishment, despite the disruption of economic activities and reduced taxes. The hunting of gray wolves, while originally actively endorsed in many countries, has become a controversial issue in some nations. Opponents see it as cruel, unnecessary and based on misconceptions, while proponents argue that it is vital for the conservation of game herds and as pest control.\n\nIn the sixth century BC, the first wolf bounty was reportedly opened when Solon of Athens offered five silver drachmas to any hunter for killing any male wolf, and one for every female.\n\nIn Ancient Rome, the treatment given to wolves differed from the treatment meted out to other large predators. The Romans generally seem to have refrained from intentionally harming wolves. For instance, they were not hunted for pleasure (but only in order to protect herds that were out at pasture), and not displayed in the venationes, either. The special status of the wolf was not based on national ideology, but rather was connected to the religious importance of the wolf to the Romans.\n\nIn England of 950, King Athelstan imposed an annual tribute of 300 wolf skins on Welsh king Hywel Dda, an imposition which was maintained until the Norman conquest of England. At the time, several criminals, rather than being put to death, would be ordered to provide a certain number of wolf tongues annually. The Norman kings (reigning from 1066 to 1154) employed servants as wolf hunters and many held lands granted on condition they fulfilled this duty. William the Conqueror granted the lordship of Riddesdale in Northumberland to Robert de Umfraville on condition that he defend that land from enemies and wolves. There were no restrictions or penalties in the hunting of wolves, except in royal game reserves, under the reasoning that the temptation for a commoner to shoot a deer there was too great. King John gave a premium of 10 shillings for the capture of two wolves. King Edward VI who reigned from 1272 to 1307 ordered the total extermination of all wolves in his kingdom and personally employed one Peter Corbet, with instructions to destroy wolves in the counties of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Shropshire and Staffordshire, areas near the Welsh Marches where wolves were more common than in the southern areas of England. James I of Scotland passed a law in 1427 requiring three wolf hunts a year between April 25 to August 1, coinciding with the wolf's cubbing season. The wolf became extinct in England during the reign of Henry VII (1485–1509).\nIt is known that wolves survived in Scotland up until the 18th century. Mary, Queen of Scots, is known to have hunted wolves in the forest of Atholl in 1563. Stories on the killing of the alleged last wolf of Scotland vary. Official records indicate that the last Scottish wolf was killed by Sir Ewan Cameron in 1680. Popular folklore on the other hand tells of how an old man named MacQueen of Pall à Chrocain in the Findhorn Valley of Morayshire killed the last wolf in 1743.\n\nIreland throughout most of the first half of the 17th century had a substantial wolf population of not less than 400 and may be as high as 1000 wolves at any one time. Although the Irish hunted wolves, it is evident from documentary data that they did not see the same need as the English to exterminate the wolves. Although wolves were perceived as threats, they were nonetheless seen as natural parts of the Irish landscapes. The level of rewards and bounties established by Oliver Cromwell's regime after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649–53) attracted a few professional wolf hunters to Ireland, mostly from England. Politically, the prospect of numbers of armed Irish roaming around the country hunting wolves was not acceptable, given the ongoing conflict between the Irish and the new English settlers, so it was seen as much safer for the English authorities to encourage men from their own country to deal with the wolf problem. Wolves were exterminated from Ireland in the late 18th century, most likely 1786.\n\nIn 9th century France, Charlemagne founded an elite corps of crown funded officials called \"Luparii\", whose purpose was to control wolf populations in France during the Middle Ages. Luparii were responsible for the initial reduction of wolf populations in France, which would become decimated in later centuries. The office of luparii is today known as the Wolfcatcher Royal. On 9 August 1787 the office of luparii was dissolved because of financing issues during the French Revolution but was reinstated twelve years later by Napoleon. After the Revolution ended, wolf hunting was no longer an activity reserved for the aristocracy. Wolves could be killed for monetary rewards equivalent to a month's pay. From 1818 to 1829, 1400 wolves were killed each year. This high kill rate coincided with the increased distribution of flintlocks. At the dawn of the 19th century, there were up to 5000 wolves in France, a number which was reduced to half that amount by 1850. By 1890, the wolf population had been reduced to 1000 animals, and further fell to 500 in 1900 because of increased usage of strychnine. Wolves temporarily increased during the First World War, though by the time it ended, the population was estimated to be between 150 and 200 animals. The last confirmed French wolf kill occurred in 1937. With the extinction of the wolf in metropolitan France, the office of Wolfcatcher Royal was modified in 1971 and now serves an administrative function regulating vermin and maintaining healthy wildlife populations.\n\nWolf bounties were regularly paid in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries and as recently as 1950's. Gian Galeazzo Visconti himself offered ten Imperial marks for every wolf killed. 600 wolves are recorded to have been bountied between the 14th and 19th centuries. Presentation of the killed wolf to the authorities was obligatory. The authorities had to give an accurate testimony with a description of the presented animal (gender, weight, measurements, color, estimated age, etc.) and the symptomatic ascertainment of eventual rabies infections. The wolf's paw was then amputated and/or its ears were sealed in wax in order to avoid the spoils being represented elsewhere. Only one case of fraudulence in 1834, which was punished by arrest, occurred. Italian wolf hunters lacked the organisation or determination of their French counterparts, having not formed any special hunting teams. Wolves were exterminated from the Alps in the 19th century, though they were never fully exterminated in the peninsula.\n\nIn Switzerland, conflicts between humans and wolves reached a peak in the 16th century, amid large-scale deforestations. Wolves became extinct in Zürich in 1684. They were later exterminated from Appenzell Ausserrhoden in 1695, and Schaffhausen in 1712. The last known traces of wolves in central Switzerland date back to 1707 in Zug, 1753 in Uri and 1793 in Glarus. Wolves became extinct in Engadin in 1821. Between 1762 and 1842, 80 wolves were recorded to have been bountied in Vaud. Wolves were further exterminated in Valais in 1870, Ticino in 1872 and Solothurn in 1874. Wolves occasionally migrated to Switzerland in small numbers in the early 20th century. In 1908, a wolf was shot in Ticino, and a further two were killed in 1914 in Lignerolle.\n\nIn 19th century Spain, the Principality of Asturias passed an act between March and December 1816 paying out bounties for the death of 76 adult and 414 young wolves at 160 reales for an adult wolf and 32 for a wolf cub. The hunting of wolves represented a considerable source of wealth for local populations, with the \"lobero\" or wolf-hunter being a respected county figure.\n\nIn an 1856 brochure, the Hungarian nationalist exile István Türr noted, among many other grievances against Habsburg rule in his country, that \"(...) Since the restriction of the liberty of hunting and the seizure of all arms in Hungary, wild beasts have so multiplied, that, besides an enormous damage done to the crops, the flocks, and the poultry, the wolves venture, not only into villages, but into the very towns, and besides doing fearful depredations, attack even people. The number of \"Kreisjager\" (district huntsmen appointed by the government) is not sufficient to destroy them; arid in consequence of the universal dislike to public functionaries, increased still more by the circumstance that they are not Hungarians, the landed proprietors do not allow them to hunt on their grounds. One of these huntsmen told me that a nobleman, being requested to allow him to kill some wolves which were in his forest, refused by saying, \" No, sir! the wolves belong to me, not to the\ngovernment.\"\n\nThe Swedish kings Magnus Eriksson and Christopher of Bavaria decreed wolf hunting a civic duty, with only priests, parish clerks and landless women exempted. Sweden's first wolf bounty was opened in 1647. The bounties remained in force in the new laws of the Kingdom of Sweden from 1734. Hundreds of Sami killed wolves in order to protect their reindeer herds. In the 1960s, wolf numbers rapidly declined with the onset of snow mobiles used for hunting. Sweden's last wolf was killed in 1966, after which, the species was declared legally protected and eventually recolonized the area.\n\nNorway followed a similar pattern as Sweden, with its last wolf being killed in 1976, before becoming being protected and eventually recolonizing the area.\n\nIn the Lithuanian SSR, the hunting of wolves was formally permitted all year long with killing cubs in their dens and payment of monetary rewards. The number of wolves in those times in Lithuania fell to about 20-40 individuals.\n\nIn Communist Romania, up to 2,800 wolves were killed between 1955 and 1965. During the reign of Nicolae Ceauşescu, a reward equal to a quarter of a month's pay was offered to rangers killing wolf cubs. Full-grown wolves killed by any method at all resulted in as much as a half-month's pay.\n\nIn Croatia, between 1986 and 2004, 115 wolf deaths were recorded, of which 54% were due to shooting. During that period, the number of dead wolves found ranged from 0-15 annually. The lowest kill rates occurred in the late 1980s, early 1990s, coinciding with the start of the Croatian War of Independence in the former state.\n\nIn Czarist Russia, before the Emancipation reform of 1861, wolf hunting was done solely by authorized firearm holders, usually police, soldiers, rich landowners or nobles. Upon learning of the frequency of attacks on livestock and humans, the Czarist Ministry of the Interior sent agents to Western Europe in order to learn how the people there dealt with wolf problems. Upon returning, the Ministry of Internal Affairs developed a plan in 1846 to deal with wolves involving the opening of wolf bounties and appointment of government hunters. Each hunter was given jurisdiction to hunt in one district, with more than one for large areas. Hunters were given 3 rubles for each male wolf killed and 1.5 for each cub, with a tail presented as proof. Each hunter would receive an annual salary of 60 rubles a year, provided he killed 15 adults and 30 cubs a year. Peasant hunters, however, were rarely rewarded, because of corrupt bureaucrats stealing the money. In 1858, after paying the equivalent of $1,250,000 for over a million wolves in Central Russia, officials became suspicious, and discovered that some hunters bought wolf pelts for low prices, cut them up and handed them to magistrates as wolf tails. In the later years of the 19th century, Russian hunting societies began an energetic campaign against wolves. In 1897, members of the Moscow Hunting Society killed their first 1000 wolves, though the number of professional wolf hunters at the time was rather low. Serfs began hunting wolves after their emancipation in 1861, though rarely with success, as civilian firearms were highly expensive, and the cheaper ones were usually primitive and unable to bear the heavy ammunition necessary to kill wolves.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution (1917), the newly formed Soviet government worked heavily to eradicate wolves and other predators during an extensive land reclamation program. During the Eastern Front, wolf populations increased, though after Nazi Germany's defeat, wolf hunts resumed. With the end of the war and the onset of aerial hunting, the USSR destroyed 42,300 wolves in 1945, 62,700 wolves in 1946, 58,700 wolves in 1947, 57,600 in 1948, and 55,300 in 1949. From 1950 to 1954, an average of 50,000 wolves were killed annually. In 1966, wolves had been successfully exterminated in 30 oblasts of the RSFSR. During this time, wolf depredations on humans and livestock had dropped by a factor of ten. However, with the publishing of a Russian translation of Farley Mowatt's fictional book \"Never Cry Wolf\", wolf hunts decreased in popularity. Amid public outcry, Czarist and Soviet records of wolf attacks on both livestock and people were ignored and wolf hunts decreased in number, allowing wolves to multiply. 15,900 wolves were reportedly culled from the RSFSR in 1978, compared to 7,900 two years prior. With an increase in population, twice as many wolves were culled in the 1980s than in the prior decade. Wolves became extinct in Wrangel Island in the early 1980s. In 1984, the RSFSR had over 2,000 wolf hunting brigades consisting of 15,000 hunters who killed 16,400 wolves. Overall, the Soviet Union culled over 1,500,000 wolves for a cost of 150,000,000 rubles on bounties alone. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many wolf bounties were lowered or dropped altogether. Wolf hunting continues in Russia, at the expense of individual hunters rather than the government.\n\nIn India, Hindus traditionally considered the hunting of wolves, even dangerous ones, as taboo, for fear of causing a bad harvest. The Santals, however, considered them fair game, as with every other forest dwelling animal. In 1876, in the North-West Provinces and Bihar State of British India, 2,825 wolves were killed in response to 721 fatal attacks on humans. Two years later, 2,600 wolves were killed in response to attacks leaving 624 humans dead. Wolf exterminations remained a priority in the NWP and Awadh through to the 1920s, because wolves were reportedly killing more people than any other predator in the region. Female cubs were bountied for 12 Indian annas, while males for 8. Higher rewards of 5 rupees for each adult and one for each cub were favored in Jaunpur. In Gorakhpur, where human fatalities were highest in summer, the reward for an adult wolf was 4 rupees, with 3 for a cub. Acts of fraud were quite common, with some bounty hunters presenting golden jackals or simply exhuming the bodies of bountied wolves and presenting them to unsuspecting magistrates for rewards. Overall, it is thought that up to 100,000 wolves were killed in British India between 1871 and 1916.\n\nBefore the onset of the Meiji restoration period in 1868, wolves had a benign rather than noxious place in Japanese culture and folklore. Wolves were, however, occasionally hunted. Wolf bounties (\"shōkin\") first appeared in Morioka where horse predation by wolves was frequent. Domain lords would pay 700 mon for males, and 900 for females, though peasants received much less. Wolves in Japan became extinct during the Meiji restoration period, an extermination known as \"ōkami no kujo\". The wolf was deemed a threat to ranching which the Meiji government promoted at the time, and targeted via a bounty system and a direct chemical extermination campaign inspired by the similar contemporary American campaign. Starting August 1875, the Iwate Prefecture government offered bounties (\"shōreikin\") of 7¥ for male wolves and 8 for females. In 1878 in Sapporo, it was decided to set higher bounties for wolves than bears in order to further motivate the ethnic Ainu people into killing wolves, which were once considered sacred to them. Hokkaido experienced significant development during this period and the Hokkaido wolf also suffered from resulting environmental disruption. The last Japanese wolf was a male killed on 23 January 1905 near Washikaguchi (now called Higashi Yoshiro). The carcass was bought by a man working for the Duke of Bedford, and was subsequently put on display in the British Museum of Natural History.\n\nIn the Mongolian People's Republic, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party organized two national wolf hunting weeks, one in March and another in December. Anyone who killed a wolf and presented a pair of ears as proof was rewarded with a sheep and some felt. Each May, the government commanded the populace to scour the countryside for wolf lairs in an effort to exterminate wolf pups. When the inhabitants of a district believed it had destroyed its last wolf, the local government would proclaim a public holiday. Records show that up to 5,000 wolves were taken annually in the early 1930s. 4,000–4,500 wolves were killed annually in Mongolia in 1976.\n\nIn the Kazakh SSR, some 1,000 professional hunters killed thousands of the wolves yearly to collect government bounties. In 1988, just before the Soviet economy collapsed, the hunters killed 16,000 wolves.\n\nIn the majority of Native American hunter-gatherer societies, wolves were usually killed for body parts used in rituals, or to stop them raiding food caches, though some tribes would raid wolf dens to kill pups when wolf populations became too large for the Natives to live with. This also served as a method of acquiring food, as wolf pups were considered a delicacy. Native Americans were aware of the dangers of habituated wolves, and would quickly dispatch wolves following them too closely. Active hunting of wolves was rare because many tribes believed that such an act would cause game animals to disappear or bring retribution from other wolves. The Cherokee feared that the unjust killing of a wolf would bring about the vengeance of its pack mates, and that the weapon used for the deed would be useless in future unless exorcised by a medicine man. However, they would kill wolves with impunity if they knew the proper rites of atonement, and if the wolves themselves happened to raid their fish nets. When the Kwakiutl killed a wolf, the animal would be laid out on a blanket and have portions of its flesh eaten by the perpetrators, who would express regret at the act before burying it. The Ahtna would take the dead wolf to a hut, where it would be propped in a sitting position with a banquet made by a shaman set before it. When men from certain Eskimo tribes killed a wolf, they would walk around their houses four times, expressing regret and abstaining from sexual relations with their wives for four days. Young Apaches would kill wolves, cougars or bears as a rite of passage. Although some of the first European colonists traveling to North America would report back that wolves were more populous in the New World than in Europe, writings from the Lewis and Clark Expedition indicate that wolves were seldom seen except in aboriginal buffer zones.\n\nAfter the European colonization of the Americas, the first American wolf bounty was passed by the Massachusetts Bay Colony on November 9, 1630. Further wolf bounties opened in Jamestown, Virginia on September 4, 1632 and in other colonies. Payments to white settlers included cash, tobacco, wine and corn, while Native Americans were given blankets and trinkets. A New Jersey law started in 1697 stated that any Christian who brought a wolf carcass to a magistrate would have been paid 20 shillings, while a Native American or black would have been paid half that much. It later became customary for Native Americans to provide two wolf pelts a year without payment. In 1688, a Virginia law abolished the requirement of tribute in wolves to be paid in accordance to the number of hunters in each tribe, demanding 725 hunters to kill 145 wolves a year.\nIn the 19th century, as the settlers began increasingly moving west in pursuit of more land for ranching, wolves were becoming increasingly more hunted as threats to livestock. In 1818, a \"War of Extermination\" against wolves and bears was declared in Ohio. Iowa began its own wolf bounty in 1858, with Wisconsin and Colorado following suit in 1865 and 1869. Wolf pelts soon began to increase in demand as beavers began to become scarce from over-trapping. In the 1830s, a wolf pelt was worth only $1, doubling in the 1850s. Records of the upper Missouri outfit of the American Fur Trading Company indicate that 20 wolf pelts were shipped down-river in 1850, with 3,000 being shipped three years later. Civilians turned Bounty hunters known as \"Wolfers\" began killing ungulates in large numbers as bait, poisoning the meat in hopes of attracting unsuspecting wolves. It is estimated that by the 1870s, this method was killing 100,000 wolves annually. Between 1916 and 1926 the National Park Service predator control program resulted in the extermination of sustainable packs of wolves in Yellowstone National Park by 1926. American wolf hunts peaked in the 1920s-1930s, when up to 21,000 were killed annually. After World War II, wolves were seen less as varmints and more as big game trophy animals.\n\nThe first Canadian wolf bounty was offered in 1793 in Ontario and Quebec. Wolves became rare in Eastern Canada by the 1870s, becoming extinct in New Brunswick by 1880, in Nova Scotia by 1900 and had disappeared from Newfoundland by 1913. Full-scale eradication programs did not peak in western and northern Canada until the 1950s, when resource development brought more people into originally sparsely populated wilderness. A government-backed wolf extermination program was initiated in 1948 after serious declines in caribou herds in the Northern Territories and a rabies concern due to wolves migrating south near populated areas. 39,960 cyanide guns, 106,100 cyanide cartridges and 628,000 strychnine pellets were distributed. Up to 17,500 wolves were poisoned in Canada between 1955 and 1961. In the mid-1950s, wolf bounties were dropped in the western provinces in favor of hiring provincial hunters. Quebec's wolf bounties ended in 1971 and Ontario in 1972. Overall, 20,000 wolves were bountied between 1935 and 1955 in British Columbia, 12,000 between 1942 and 1955 in Alberta and 33,000 between 1947 and 1971 in Ontario.\nUnlike wolf populations in the lower 48 states, which declined steadily as settlers moved west, the Canadian wolf population fluctuated between growth and decline, largely because the human population in Canada never reached the same level as in the lower 48, thus leaving large areas of land free for the wolves.\n\nUnlike European wolf hunts which were usually reserved for the nobility, North American wolf hunts were partaken by ordinary citizens, nearly all of them possessing firearms, thus the extermination of wolves in the lower 48 states was carried out in far less time than in Europe.\n\nIn Norway, in 2001, the government authorized a controversial wolf cull on the grounds that the animals were overpopulating and were responsible for the killing of more than 600 sheep in 2000. The Norwegian authorities' original plans to kill 20 wolves were scaled down amid public outcry. However, sheep farmers generally welcome wolf hunting, as the wolves are a great threat to sheep and dogs. In 2005, the Norwegian government proposed another cull, with the intent of exterminating 25% of Norway's wolf population. \n\nAs of 2015, there were an estimated 460 wolves in the Scandinavian population, with the large majority located in Sweden. Wolf hunting is controversial in Sweden, where decisions by public authorities to authorize hunting seasons each year since 2010 have resulted in legal challenges by the European Commission and by NGOs.\n\nIn Spain, wolves are hunted north of the Duero river under strict conditions to control damage over livestock, but are strictly protected at the South margin. The recent Wolf expansion even to the mountains of Madrid, has generated a great controversy in Autonomous Community of Castile-León over whether to allow hunting also south of the Duero river.\n\nThe European Union has exceptionally permitted Estonia, which has the highest wolf density in the EU, to continue wolf hunting as long as the overall numbers remain stable. In 2010, 173 wolves were permitted to be culled, but only 130 were actually caught. In 2011, 149 wolves were culled of the permitted 150.\n\nUnder the Berne Convention wolves in France are listed as an endangered species, and killing them is illegal, though official culls are permitted to protect farm animals as long as there is no threat to the species in its entirety.\n\nThough wolf populations have increased in Ukraine, wolves remain unprotected there and can be hunted year-round by permit-holders.\n\nBulgaria considers the wolf a pest animal and there is a bounty equivalent to two weeks average wages on their heads.\n\nWith the exception of specimens in nature reserves, wolves in Belarus are largely unprotected. They are designated a game species, and bounties ranging between 60 and 70 Euros are paid to hunters for each wolf killed. This is a considerable sum in a country where the average monthly wage is 230 Euros.\n\nIn Russia, government-backed wolf exterminations have been largely discontinued since the fall of the Soviet Union. As a result, their numbers have stabilized and are increasing, though they are still hunted legally. According to Alexander Tikhonov, head of the Department of Hunting Resources \"the more wolves you have, the more problems there are\". His department currently licenses a national bag limit of up to 14,000 wolves annually, with permits given to hunt even within nature reserves. Currently, Russia is the only nation where poison is legally used to kill wolves. The government licensed a fluorine-acetate-barium compound and distributed it through hunting associations.\n\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union, wolf hunting in Kazakhstan has decreased in profit. About 2,000 are killed yearly for a $40 bounty, though the animal's numbers have risen sharply.\n\nWolf hunting has become a fashionable pastime for Mongolia's new capitalist rich, particularly around Ulaanbaatar. It is currently illegal to shoot animals from helicopters or jeeps, though many rich hunters do not pay attention to this, including the lawmakers. For Mongolian nomads, hunting wolves is more than a rich man's hobby because of evocations to the wolf's role in their mythology. Most post-Soviet Mongols have reverted to the traditional belief that to kill a wolf in January, or even to see one, brings good fortune for the whole year.\n\nIn 2006, the government of the People's Republic of China began plans to auction licenses for foreigners to hunt wild animals, including wolves which are the only carnivores on the list of animals that can be hunted. The license to shoot a wolf can apparently be acquired for $200.\n\nIn Alaska, it is illegal to shoot a wolf with a rimfire rifle because wolves are classified as big game. The state predator control program includes aerial shooting. In 2007 state biologists' goal was to have volunteer hunters kill 407 to 680 wolves by the time the predator-control season ended April 30, but high fuel prices and poor flying conditions kept hunters from meeting that goal. A subsidy of $150 per wolf offered by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game was overturned by a judge on the grounds that only the Board of Game had the power to offer bounties. Despite relatively heavy hunting and trapping over the last century in Alaska, wolves occur on nearly all of their traditional habitat throughout mainland Alaska. Alaska currently has five wolf control programs that comprise about 9.4% of the state's land area. A closely controlled permit system is used in allowing aerial or airborne methods to remove wolves in designated areas. Wolf numbers are temporarily reduced in these areas, but are not permanently eliminated from any area. Wolf populations in North America commonly sustain annual harvests or natural mortality rates of 20–40% without experiencing a year-to-year decline in numbers. Sarah Palin of Alaska in 2007 approved the use of this provision in the law to shoot wolves and bears while flying for the purpose of protection of property.\n\nMany scientists believe that this artificial inflation of game populations is actually detrimental to both caribou and moose populations as well as the ecosystem as a whole; artificially boosted populations \"could result in habitat destruction by moose and caribou, and ultimately, a crash in these populations\". This is why large numbers of people support the Protect America's Wildlife (PAW) Act which was proposed to Congress by George Miller, the state representative of California in July 2009. This legislation has already received official support from nine former members of Alaska's Board of Game and Wildlife and conservation groups, including Defenders of Wildlife. According to Miller, \"The state of Alaska has been operating an airborne hunting program that has blatantly ignored federal law, ignored Alaskans' opposition, ignored the science, and ignored even their own wildlife experts. It's time to ground this air assault on wolves. The PAW Act is urgently needed to close the loophole in federal law and protect our nation's wildlife from the unethical and unsportsmanlike practice of airborne hunting.\" The PAW Act has been created to close the loophole in the existing Airborne Hunting Act that has allowed Alaska legislators and officials to continue to aerial hunt. The bill would clarify under which conditions it is acceptable to use aircraft to aid in the management of wildlife. It would bar states from using aerial hunting to artificially boost game species when they are not at risk and to clarify the prohibition of harassing animals from planes which is part of the \"land and shoot\" hunting that is being utilized in Alaska. The PAW Act acknowledges the right of states to manage wildlife by clearly stating that wildlife agencies may use planes to respond to legitimate biological emergencies in wildlife populations. It also states that aircraft may be used for animal control where land, livestock, water, pets, crops, or human health are at risk.\n\nAn estimated 15% of Canada and Alaska's wolf population of 6,000-7,000 is harvested annually. (Canada's total wolf population is about 30,000. Sentence needs rewording.) Ontario ceased its wolf bounty system in 1972, though retaining a year-round open season for wolves. In Alberta, wolves bounties are still offered by some local governments. Starting in 2010, Big Lakes County offered a bounty of C$300 per adult wolf, leading to 290 wolves worth $87,000 by mid-2012.\n\nAfter the gray wolf was removed from the endangered species list for the western great lakes region in January 2012, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources instituted a hunting season to manage the population. This new season ran from November 3, 2012 through the 18th, 2012 in some regions and continued November 24, 2012 and ran through January 31, 2013 or until the tag limit was reached. That limit was set at a target of 400 wolves across the state. The total number of wolves harvested in this inaugural season was 412 wolves. 12 more wolves were harvested past the target number. On December 19, 2014 a US Federal Court ordered a stop to the hunting of wolves in Minnesota, Wisconsin and in Michigan.\n\nThe grey wolf \"(Canis lupus)\" is the largest member of the Canidae. Though once abundant over much of North America and Eurasia, the grey wolf inhabits a very small portion of its former range because of widespread destruction of its habitat; in some regions it is endangered or threatened. Considered as a whole, however, the grey wolf is regarded as of least concern for extinction according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Wolf weight and size can vary greatly worldwide, tending to increase proportionally with latitude as predicted by Bergmann's Rule. Wolves are usually hunted in heavy brush and are considered especially challenging to hunt, because of their elusive nature and sharp senses. Grey wolves are notoriously shy and difficult to kill, having been stated to be almost as hard to stalk as cougars, and being far more problematic to dispatch with poison, traps or hounds. However, wolves generally do not defend themselves as effectively as cougars or bears. Some wolves will evade capture for very long periods of time and display great cunning. One specimen nicknamed \"Three Toes of Harding County\" in South Dakota eluded its pursuers for 13 years before finally being caught. Another wolf nicknamed \"Rags the digger\" near Meeker, Colorado would deliberately ruin trap lines by digging up traps without tripping them. In sport hunting, wolves are usually taken in late autumn and early winter, when their pelts are of the highest quality and because the heavy snow makes it easier for the wolves to be tracked. Adult wolves are usually too fast to be overtaken by wolfhounds, but not for well conditioned horses, especially in thick snow. A shot wolf must be approached with caution, as some wolves will play possum. Accounts as to how wolves react to being trapped or cornered vary. John James Audubon wrote that young wolves typically show little resistance to being caught, whereas older, more experienced wolves will fight savagely.\n\nWolves are commonly hunted for their fur. The color of a wolf's fur can vary, from the pure white of the largest, Alaskan wolves, through the range of reddish brown. Even the so-called \"grey wolves\" can include pure black pups in a litter, although grey is the most common color. Wolves have two kinds of hairs; an outer coat of long, stiff hairs called \"guard hairs\" and an \"undercoat\" of soft fur which grows thick in the winter and helps to insulate their bodies from the cold; this fur has the advantage of not freezing. The five inch (127 mm) long guard hairs which are shed in spring and summer are waterproof, keeping the wolf's underfur dry and warm. The fur of the undercoat may be nearly two and a half inches thick and help keep a wolf warm even in temperatures reaching 40 degrees below zero. Wolves in warm climates have shorter guard hairs and less dense underfur. In some areas of medieval Europe, pelts were the only considered practicality of wolves. Pelts were usually made into cloaks or mittens, though not without hesitation, because of the wolf's strong odor. Wolf pelts were important to many Native American tribes and considered by some to be powerful medicine. Sacred articles were wrapped in wolf skin and some tribes also wove wolf and American bison hair together in small blankets. Native American hunters used wolf pelts as disguises to allow them stalk close bison herds. The bison were accustomed to having wolves walk among them and did not fear wolves unless they were vulnerable because of disease, injury, or if guarding young. Wolf pelts were also valuable as clothing, objects for trade and for ruffs or coats. They were also used in ritual dances and worn by some shamans, or medicine men. Tundra-dwelling wolves are especially valued, as their pelages are more luxuriant than those of forest dwelling wolves, sometimes selling for twice as much. Females typically have smoother coats than males. Ethiopian wolves are not usually exploited for fur, though there was an occasion in Wollo in which wolf skins were used as saddle pads. In Russia, between the years 1600–1725, wolves were not actively sought out for their fur, which was not considered a major commodity, though they were taken when the opportunity presented itself.\nIn the former Soviet Union, between 1976 and 1988, 30,000 wolf pelts were produced annually. Recent statistics from CITES indicate that 6,000-7,000 wolf skins are internationally traded each year, with Canada, the former Soviet Union, Mongolia and China being the largest exporters, and the United States and Great Britain being the largest importers. Today, wolf pelts are still valued for parka trim, fur coats and rugs. The production of wolf pelts is still an important source of income for Arctic communities in Alaska and Canada.\n\nWhile not in the same class as high grade furbearers like beaver, otter or mink, the gray wolf's fur is nonetheless thick and durable, and is primarily used for scarfs and the trimmings of women's garments, though it is occasionally used for jackets, short capes, coats, mukluks and rugs. Aside from bodily protection and adornment, gray wolf pelts have also been used as camouflage in hunting and warfare, as an insignia among western Native Americans and as a form of currency. The quality of wolf peltries rests on the density and strength of the fur fibre, which keeps the fur upright and gives the pelt an appealing bushy aspect. These characteristics are mostly found in northern wolf populations, but gradually lessen further south in warmer climates. North American wolf pelts are among the most valuable, as they are silkier and fluffier than Eurasian peltries. In Medieval Europe, pelts were considered the only practical aspect of wolves, though they were seldom used, because of the skin's foul odour. In Scandinavian folklore, wolf-skin girdles assisted in transforming the wearers into werewolves, while several Native American tribes used wolf pelts for medicinal purposes. Plains Indians often wore wolf pelts as disguises to get close to American bison when hunting. The Pawnee wore wolf skins as capes when exploring enemy territories. The United States Army used wolf skin for parkas during the later stages of World War II and the Korean War to protect the faces of soldiers from frostbite. In the Soviet Union, 30,000 wolf pelts were produced annually between 1976 and 1988. Statistics from CITES indicate that 6,000–7,000 wolf skins are internationally traded each year, with Canada, the former Soviet Union, Mongolia and China being the largest exporters, and the United States and Great Britain being the largest importers. Overall, the harvesting of wolves for their fur has little impact on their population, as only the northern varieties (whose numbers are stable) are of commercial value. Wolf trapping for fur remains a lucrative source of income for many Native Americans.\n\nIn Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, wolf flesh was a main ingredient in unguents used to ward off evil. When applied in the form of a powder, the wolf unguent would be used to cure epilepsy, plague and gout. Powdered wolf bones were used to cure chest and back pains, broken bones and strained tendons. Wolf teeth, particularly the canines, would be perforated and used as talismans against evil spirits. This practice is thought to fall back to the Paleolithic, as shown by some prehistoric grave sites showing numerous wolf tooth charms. It continues in some areas of rural France, where it is also thought that wearing a wolf tooth offers protection from wolf attacks. The tongue, when cooked with flour and honey, was traditionally used as a remedy for epilepsy and as a guarantee of good luck. The eyes of a wolf were traditionally thought to give courage to children and render the user partially invisible. The liver was particularly prized for medicinal and ritualistic purposes. When cooked or desiccated into a powder and mixed with certain ingredients (flour, wine, water, blood, urine etc.), wolf liver was said to cure epilepsy, edema, tachycardia, syphilis, gangrene, vertigo, migraines, verucas and dysentery. Wolf penis supposedly cured impotence. Wolf blood was used for gout, period pains and deafness. The paws and fat of a wolf were sometimes used to ward off evil, or facilitate the transformation of a werewolf. Wolf dung was used against colics. The milk of a she-wolf made the drinker invulnerable, while eating the heart of a wolf gave the consumer courage in battle. A wolf's tail, while used for warding off evil, was also used as a love charm. The head of a wolf, if hung outside a house, would deter wolves, robbers and evil spirits. When reduced to powder, a wolf's head could be used against toothache and joint pains. In the cultures of certain Native American tribes, wolf body parts were considered important additions to certain rituals. Pawnee warriors, known as Wolf People, dressed in wolf skin cloaks when scouting or hunting. Nez Perce warriors wore wolf teeth pushed through the septums of their noses. Cheyenne medicine men wrapped wolf fur on sacred arrows used to motion prey into traps. Arikara men wove wolf fur with bison fur in order to make small sacred blankets. Nuxálk mothers painted wolf gall bladders on their young male children's backs, so they could grow up to perform religious ceremonies without making mistakes as hunters. Hidatsan women experiencing difficult births would call upon the familial power of wolves by rubbing wolf-skin caps on their bellies. In Mongolian folk medicine, eating the intestines of a wolf is said to alleviate chronic indigestion, while sprinkling food with powdered wolf rectum is said to cure haemorroids. There are not many traditional uses for Ethiopian wolves, though their livers may be used for medicinal reasons in northern Ethiopia.\n\nIt is rare for wolves to be hunted for food, though historically, people have resorted to consuming wolf flesh in times of scarcity, or for medicinal reasons.\n\nMost Native American tribes, especially the Naskapis, viewed wolf flesh as edible but inadequate nutrition, as it was not a herbivore and thus did not possess the same healing qualities thought to be distinct in plant eaters. The mountain people of Japan once ate wolf meat in order to boost their courage, though they commented that the meat was tough. Mountain dwelling wolves known as \"yomainu\" were considered poisonous. The \"\"Derboun\"\" of the Arabian mountains and southern Syria was a small black wolf which apparently was considered by the Arabs to be more closely related to dogs, as they freely ate its flesh like any other game, unlike with regular wolves which had an unpleasant odour. During the European colonization of Western America, wolf meat was considered \"not usually eatable\", though fair game for a hungry man. However, Martin Schmitt argued that references to the consumption of wolf meat at the time may have actually been on coyotes. During Vilhjalmur Stefansson's Arctic expedition in 1913, George H. Wilkins sampled cooked wolf meat and commented that it was \"fine eating\" and noted a resemblance to chicken. According to Maneka Gandhi, wolf meat is a major source of trichinellosis. Wolf meat is considered haram under Islamic dietary laws (Sahih Muslim, no: 1934)\n\nIn an 1868 issue of \"The Sant Paul's Magazine\", Anthony Trollope gave an account on the palatability of wolf flesh, and how it was sometimes used as the subject of practical jokes among French hunters.\n\nWolf meat was eaten several times during Vilhjalmur Stefansson's 1913 Arctic expedition, particularly during the summer, when wolves were fat. Natives in Transbaikalia reportedly ate wolf meat even when other food was plentiful. The consumption of wolf flesh and organs plays an important role in Asian folk medicine: in Mongolia, eating the meat and lungs of a wolf is said to alleviate colds, and sprinkling food with powdered wolf rectum is said to cure haemorroids. Some Japanese mountain people ate wolf meat to give them courage. Accounts on how wolf meat tastes vary greatly, with descriptions ranging from \"tough\", \"gristly\", \"distasteful\" and \"smelly\", to \"somewhat [resembling] chicken\", and \"very superior to lean venison\".\n\nWolf hunting historically gave rise to a vast vocabulary:\n\n\nAerial shooting involves the tracking of wolves via a small airplane or helicopter and is considered by many to be the most effective method of wolf control. It was frequently used in the Soviet Union during its wolf control campaigns, starting in 1946 when the Chief Directorate of Aviation received reports that pilots flying at low altitudes frequently saw wolves. Polikarpov Po-2s and Antonov An-2s were the most frequently used models. The normal protocol was for the pilot to search frontally, and the shooter sideways. 70%-80% of wolves were first sighted by the pilot. Rocket guns would be fired into dense brush in order to scare wolves out into the open. Markers were thrown at the site of each kill for later collection. Actual shooting was done from the rear cockpit or left side when at a distance of 18–20 metres from the quarry. An experienced shooter could spot a standing wolf a kilometre away at heights of up to 100–140 metres. Most wolves were killed when the planes flew at speeds of 70 to 85 km/h. The load limit of a Po-2 was 2 men and 5 adult wolves; the rear cockpit could hold 4 wolves, while the shooter's cockpit could hold 2, or carcasses could be tied to the fuselage or wings of the plane. Aerial hunting has been discontinued in the former Soviet Union because of budget restraints. Wolf hunting is still practiced this way in the U.S state of Alaska. \"Congress passed the Federal Airborne Hunting Act of 1972, which made it illegal for hunters to shoot animals from a plane or helicopter. The federal legislation does have a provision for predator control, permitting state employees or licensed individuals to shoot from an aircraft for the sake of protecting \"land, water, wildlife, livestock, domesticated animals, human life, or crops\".\n\nThe use of heated box blinds is a popular method of wolf hunting in modern Alberta. Bait stations are set in advance of the hunt, with blinds being erected in the more frequented spots. The method was developed as a response to the fact that finding wolves on foot was almost always a pure luck scenario, because of the wolf's elusiveness. Shots are usually fired when the wolf is from the blind.\n\nCalling is a traditional wolf hunting method of Mongolia. The hunters go to the place where the pack is located early in the morning and will imitate a wolf's howl. The hunters howl in unison with the wolves and wait for the animals to come to them. Mongolian wolf hunting is usually done with the assistance of local herders.\n\nIn modern European Russia, a traditional wolf hunting method involves encircling the located wolf pack with a 3-5 kilometer (2-3 mile) fladry, a long rope with small swatches of fabric stitched to it every few feet. The fabric is usually red in order to be easier spotted over the background of snow by the guides. Since it retains a human scent for several days, wolves tend to stay within the encircled area. When the hunters arrive, the pack of wolves is already \"flagged\".\n\nSeveral dog breeds known as wolfhounds have been bred for the purpose of hunting wolves, though conventional hunting breeds have also been used.\n\nThe use of raptors in the hunting of wolves is primarily practised in Central Asia. The Kyrgyz people have traditionally used golden eagles, known as \"berkut\", to hunt wolves. In the past, wolf pelts provided material for clothes crucial for the survival of the nomadic people in the severe colds. The eagles are used to immobilize the wolves by placing one foot at the back of the neck and another at the flank closer to the heart and lungs. Hunters usually only use eagles against pups, as an adult wolf can cripple in combat even a highly experienced eagle. Losing even one toe or talon will significantly lower the eagle's ability to tackle prey. Only a minor injury to the sinew of a foot may leave the eagle incapable of further hunting. As a wolf is capable of resisting even the best-trained bird, the falconer always keeps near, ready at the first opportunity to help the eagle. This is done carefully, as the wolf, sensing human presence, fights desperately to tear loose from the bird's talons, and the eagle can be severely injured. Because of the violent nature of their work, eagles trained to hunt wolves have shorter life spans.\n\nIn 19th century Russia and Scandinavia, pigs were used as decoys and were transported in strong canvas sacks on horse-drawn sleighs. The pigs, kept in the canvas bags, were made to squeal in order to attract the wolves. Hunters would wait at a distance to shoot the wolves when they came out after the pig. Once the wolves arrived, the hunters would either shoot them or retrieve the pig and canvas bag. In the latter case, they took off down the road, luring the wolves behind. The wolves would be led to a palisade, where they would be trapped and shot.\n\nHistorically, poisoning was very successful in reducing wolf populations, particularly in the American West and Imperial Japan. Strychnine was the most frequently used compound. The poison would be typically mixed in lard or tallow, and spread on bits of meat, or placed within incisions on the bait. Though effective, the method had the disadvantage of greatly loosening the fur of the dead wolf, causing it to shed easily. Wolves killed by strychnine were typically skinned immediately after death, in order to avoid the fur absorbing too much of the poison.\n\nIn Lapland, wolves were occasionally hunted by the Lapps on skis. They would be armed with stout, poles tipped with a pike which was used both as propulsion and as a weapon. A skidor hunt was usually undertaken by multiple hunters over a course of a few days. The kill itself was usually made at a slope or hillside.\n\nThe Native Americans used two kinds of knife traps. One method was to encase a sharp blade in fat and frozen upright on a block of ice. The wolf would cut itself while licking the blade and bleed to death. Some argue that this method is a myth. The other method was a baited torsion spring which when triggered, would stab the wolf in the head.\n\nAcross the top of the trapping pit was a thick stick or pole, and on this was fastened a plank, which covered the top of the trap. On one end of this plank was a piece of venison, and on the other a stone. The way the trap was meant to work was this: The wolf would come to the venison, and just as it got on the plank to eat it, the plank would turn, causing the wolf to fall into the pit. The weight of the stone at the other end would bring the plank up again, ready baited for another wolf.\n\nSteel wolf traps, used frequently in the American west, were made from heavy steel, were six and a half inches wide, and had two springs, each with 100 lbs of power. Steel wolf traps were usually the same models used in the capture of beavers, lynx and wolverine. In order to hide the human scent, trappers would handle their equipment with gloves, and cover the traps in beeswax or blood. As the wolf's power of scent is so great, a mere touch of human skin on the trap will result in the wolf vacating the area. Wolves may also dig up or spring the traps. The traps would typically be set in fours around a bait and strongly fastened to concealed logs, and covered in moss, chaff, cotton or sand for camouflage. Sometimes, the trap and the bait would be placed in a pool of water, thus leaving no other point of access for the wolf to take.\n\nModern wolf hunting has become a controversial issue in some countries.\n\nOpponents have argued that at least in North America, wolves contribute little to overall livestock losses. In 2005 0.11% of all cattle losses were due to wolves. In states with wolf populations, they were responsible for an average of 2.5% of predation on sheep. Jim Dutcher, a filmmaker who raised a captive wolf pack, observed that the wolves were very reluctant to try meat that they had not previously eaten or seen another wolf eat before, possibly explaining why livestock depredation is unlikely except in cases of desperation. In Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, wolf predation accounts for 1% of total sheep deaths.\n\nWolf hunting proponents have drawn attention to the fact that wolves will on occasion commit acts of surplus killing when within the confines of human-made livestock shelters. Rare incidents of surplus killing by wolves in Minnesota are reported to leave up to 35 sheep killed and injured in flocks and losses of 50 to 200 birds in turkey flocks. In spite of the low percentage of attacks on livestock in Minnesota, farms in wolf territories and environments may become more susceptible to depredation under certain conditions. These conditions include larger farm size, increased numbers of cattle, an increased distance from human management, and improper disposal of livestock carcasses. While loss of livestock by wolves makes up only a small percentage of total losses in North America, surveys in Eurasia show some instances where wolf predation was frequent. In some areas of the former Soviet Union, wolves cause serious damage to watermelon plantations. Wolves will usually only take ripe melons after giving test bites, which can render even unripe fruits worthless for future consumption. Sometimes, up to 20% of the total watermelon crop can be destroyed on one raid.\n\nWolf hunting opponents have argued that wolves serve vital functions in areas where they are sympatric with game herds. By culling unhealthy animals, wolves allegedly keep game herds healthy. Opponents state that without wolves, prey populations swell unnaturally, unbalancing ecosystems whilst simultaneously sapping wildlife management resources. In the Iberian Peninsula for example, conservationists consider wolves to be beneficial because they keep wild boar populations stable, thus allowing some respite to the endangered capercaillie populations which suffer greatly from boar predation. In Yellowstone National Park, wolves were shown to have a hugely positive effect on general ecological health, and by extension, that of game herds. Game animals in Yellowstone killed off all young, reachable tree saplings, destroying beaver, songbird, insect, fish and amphibian populations, and threatening to starve themselves via overexploitation. Wolves reduced game animal numbers and forced them to be more mobile, allowing more saplings to grow and allowing the populations of aforementioned animals to increase.\n\nProponents for wolf hunting often point out the apparently adverse effects large wolf populations have on game herds. An example occurred in 2008, in which the Alaska Board of Game approved plans calling for department staff to shoot wolves from helicopters on the southern Alaska Peninsula in order to assist the survival of the Southern Alaska Peninsula Caribou Herd. Wolves were believed to be responsible for a dramatic drop in the Southern Alaska Caribou Herd's population, which once numbered up to 10,000 in 1983, only to drop to a population of 600 animals in 2008. Wolf predation was also believed to be responsible for virtually no calves surviving for the two years prior the culling plans, despite a 70% pregnancy rate. In the former Soviet Union, depending on the locality, a single wolf can consume 90 saiga, 50-80 wild boar or an average of 50 domestic or wild caribou annually. A pack of 2-5 wolves will often kill 2 caribou every three days. Further reports from the former Soviet Union indicate that rather than prey on exclusively sick or infirm prey, wolves seem to attack young or pregnant animals far more frequently, regardless of their sanitary state. In the Nenetskij National Okrug, wolves were shown to select pregnant female domestic caribou and calves rather than infirm specimens, with some reports showing that wolves bypassed emaciated, sickly animals in favour of well fed ones. Large numbers of wolves have also been blamed on the decline of critically endangered saiga antelope herds in Central Asia. During the late 1950s and early 1960s when the Soviet Union used poison to effectively bring down wolf numbers, the number, as well as the range of moose, wild boar and red deer increased. Caspian seals were valued as fur bearers in the Soviet industry, and in a three-week period in February 1978, wolves were responsible for the wanton killing of numerous seals on the Caspian sea near Astrakhan. Between 17-40% of the seals in the area were estimated to have been killed, but not eaten.\n\nSome hunt proponents argue that large numbers of wolves are central to the spread of numerous infectious diseases because of their nomadic nature. Diseases recorded to be carried by wolves include rabies, brucella, deerfly fever, listeriosis, foot and mouth disease and anthrax. Wolves are major hosts for rabies in Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq and India. Wolves in Russia have been recorded to carry over 50 different kinds of harmful parasites. A 10-year study in the former Soviet Union showed that in some regions, every successful wolf litter in spring coincided with a 100% increase in cestode infections in moose and wild boar, with some specimen having up to 30-40 cysts. It also showed that where wolves were absent, the number of cysticerosis infected wild ungulates was much less. Despite their habit of carrying harmful diseases, large wolf populations are not negatively influenced by epizootic outbreaks as with other canids, and thus some hunting proponents argue that disease cannot be a guarantee of naturally controlling wolf numbers.\n\nThe absence of a global review, and the language barrier having partially hindered the flow of international information has led some international groups to level criticism at some wolf advocates, claiming that they have extrapolated America's general lack of negative experiences with wolves to the rest of the world, whilst ignoring the differing histories and cultures which lead to diverse interactions with the animals. Hunting proponents argue that wolves with no negative experiences of humans are more likely to encroach upon human settlements and attack people, citing for example the differences in attitudes toward the public distribution of firearms in America and Eurasia as examples as to why nations on both continents have differing accounts of wolf aggression. Hunting wolves is reasoned to maintain shyness in wolves, an idea which is correlated by a modern account demonstrating that wolves in protected areas are more likely to show no fear toward humans than ones in areas where they are actively hunted. Historical and recent accounts indicate that individual wolves or wolf packs that turn man-eater typically do not stop until hunted and destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The paper was printed at Cox's plant in Franklin, Ohio and distributed in Butler and Warren counties. In September 2013, Cox Media Group Ohio announced that \"The Middletown Journal\" would cease to exist effective November 1, 2013 when the paper was merged with the \"Hamilton JournalNews\" into a new publication, the \"Journal-News\".\n\nThe paper was first published January 12, 1857, as the \"Western Journal\", a weekly paper issued on Thursday mornings, by C.H. Brock, a Middletown grocer. The name was changed to the \"Middletown Journal\" in 1859. Publication was suspended during the American Civil War, but resumed by 1871, when Brock sold the paper to E.T. Hardraker. The paper went through a series of owners, including George H. McKee and James L. Raymond. In 1880, W.H. Todhunter acquired the paper and made it a Republican journal. Todhunter began daily publication of the paper in 1890. The first Sunday edition was published on September 4, 1921. In 1924, the paper was purchased by Chew Publications, the owner of the \"Xenia Gazette\".\n\nIn 1928, the paper purchased the other daily in Middletown, the \"Middletown News-Signal\". The \"Journal\" was published as an evening paper chiefly distributed in the city and the \"News-Signal\" operated as a morning paper distributed to outlying areas. The two papers published a combined Sunday edition, the \"Sunday News-Journal\". Chew owned the paper until 1978, when the company merged with the Thomson Corporation, the Canadian newspaper giant. When Thomson decided to exit the newspaper business, it reached a deal to sell the \"Journal\", the \"Hamilton JournalNews\", and several weekly papers in southwest Ohio to Gannett, the parent of \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\". However, Cox Newspapers, the parent of the \"Dayton Daily News\" and the \"Springfield News-Sun\", had an option on Thomson's properties and the papers were instead sold to Cox. The sale was completed September 2, 2000.\n\nOver the years, the newspaper has been recognized by the Associated Press for photography, sports and headline writing. It has also won first-place awards from the Associated Press for Breaking News, Best Feature Writer and Best Sports Radio.\n\nIts website was MiddletownJournal.com and featured local breaking news from Middletown, Monroe, Trenton, and Franklin.\n\n\n"}

He is one of only six poker players to win both a World Series of Poker main event and a World Poker Tour championship. Including his WSOP Main Event victory, Hachem has finished in the money in thirteen World Series events.\n\nAs of January 2018, Hachem's tournament winnings exceed $12,200,000, making him the 35th highest ranked player in live tournament career earnings.\n\nJoseph Hachem was born in Lebanon on 11 March 1966. In 1972, at age six, Hachem and his family moved to Melbourne, Australia. He worked as a chiropractor for 13 years before giving up the career after developing a rare blood disorder that affected the blood vessels in his hands. Around 1995, while taking time off to consider his future, Hachem started to play poker with greater frequency, mostly in casinos, as well as online. He also ran a small brokerage business in Pascoe Vale, Victoria. Hachem said he was too temperamental when he first started playing poker and had to learn to control his temper. Around 2000, after years of casual playing, Hachem started playing regularly in tournaments at the Crown Casino and Entertainment Complex in Melbourne, where he often ended in the money. Hachem spent another five years playing regularly on the Melbourne tournament circuit before setting his sights on the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nJust prior to entering the 2005 World Series of Poker, Hachem visited the Bicycle Casino in Bell Gardens, California to play in a no limit Texas hold 'em game. One of the players made a joke that Hachem was stopping in before being crowned the new \"Australian champion\". Hachem entered the World Series of Poker as a relatively unknown poker player. Two weeks prior to the main event, Hachem finished 10th in the $1,000 buy-in No Limit Hold'em World Series event, winning $25,850.\n\nHachem won the 2005 World Series of Poker $10,000 no limit Texas hold 'em Main Event, outlasting 5,618 other players. He won $7,500,000 for the first-place finish, then a record for all-time largest poker tournament prize. He entered the tournament by paying the $10,000 entrance fee in cash. Hachem ended the first day of the tournament with 67,000 in chips, about twice the average, and he said the strong start gave him confidence going into the rest of the tournament. Hachem's chip stack stayed at the tournament average for most of the tournament until he reached the final table, which lasted a record 13 hours and 54 minutes. A number of fellow Australians provided moral support from the audience, chanting \"Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, Oi, Oi, Oi!\".\n\nHachem was short-stacked for much of the final table, and was constantly being re-raised by professional player Aaron Kanter. With four players left in the hand, Hachem was rejuvenated when he went all in with against Kanter, who had . Hachem caught a queen on the flop and doubled his chips. In a later interview, Hachem said he knew the hand was a turning point for him. He took the chip lead with three players remaining and after going heads-up against Steve Dannenmann, it took Hachem only six hands to win the game. In the final hand, Hachem called a pre-flop raise from 300,000 to 700,000 chips with , one of the worst starting hands in Texas hold 'em. The flop came , giving Hachem a straight. When the turn brought the , Steve Dannenmann made the top pair (with an open-ended straight draw) with his starting hand of . Hachem bet, Dannenmann raised, Hachem moved all-in and was called. In the end, Dannenmann could only tie if the river brought a 7 (giving him the same straight), but the on the river ensured Hachem the win.\n\nAfter winning the tournament, Hachem wrapped himself in an Australian flag and shouted, \"Thank you, America!\" Hachem was the first Australian to win the World Series of Poker Main Event, and he immediately developed a strong fan base in Australia. During a post-tournament interview, WSOP commentator Norman Chad declared, \"Hachem turned 7-3 offsuit into $7.5 million. Pass the sugar!\" Hachem himself first used the line, which came to be considered a catchphrase, after flopping a flush with against Andrew Black's three queens, and winning a large pot. (Actually, Hachem had said \"Pass the sugar!\" prematurely: had the board paired, Black would have had at least a full house, which would have eliminated Hachem.)\n\nHachem and his World Series main event win have been credited with starting a boom in popularity for poker in Australia. Hachem continued playing home games with his friends after his main event victory. In 2008, it was announced a documentary film focusing on Hachem's 2005 World Series of Poker victory, as well as the eight other players at the main event final table, is under production. The film \"Pass the Sugar\", is set to be directed by Gil Cates Jr., who previously directed the 2008 poker-themed film, \"Deal\".\n\nAlso in 2005, Hachem made the final table of a World Series of Poker circuit event at the Bally's Las Vegas Hotel and Casino casino in Las Vegas. Hachem was the chip leader during much of the final table, but suffered a crippling setback against Kido Pham, who went all in with a Jack and ten. Hachem called with pocket kings, but lost when two jacks came up on the flop, costing Hachem almost all of his chips. He was eventually eliminated by Lee Watkinson in fifth place, earning Hachem $88,172. After the match, Hachem said, \"I came here wanting to avoid making any mistakes. The fact is, I didn't make a mistake. I'm proud of the way I played in this tournament, although it is very painful not to win.\n\nAt the 2006 World Series of Poker, Hachem finished second in the , which drew 1,068 players. During the final hand, Hachem went all in with and was called by Dutch Boyd, who had . Although a favorite after the flop of , Hachem lost when Boyd caught a five of diamonds on the river. Hachem won $256,800 from the second-place finish, but was nevertheless visibly disappointed by the outcome, and was comforted by his wife Jeanine and friend Greg Raymer, the 2004 World Series of Poker champion.\n\nAlso in the 2006 World Series, Hachem finished fourth in the , which had a starting field of 562 players. In the final table, Hachem eliminated Lee Grove with a pair of kings and Alex Jacob with three queens. But Hachem was eliminated after once again taking a bad beat on the river. He moved all in against John Gale with on a , against Gale's . Gale eliminated Hachem after catching an ace of spades on the river. Hachem earned $90,482 for the fourth-place finish, and Gale eventually won the tournament.\n\nHachem finished in 238th place at the , earning him $42,882. In defense of his 2005 title, Hachem outlasted about 97% of the record field of 8,773 players in the tournament. Hachem was eliminated after his pocket Aces were outdrawn by Andrew Schreibman's pocket Jacks. He was the last remaining Main Event champion left in the field, as Greg Raymer had been the year before.\n\nIn December 2006, Hachem won $2,207,575 and his first World Poker Tour title at the Bellagio Casino's Five Diamonds Poker Classic. The victory made Hachem one of only six poker players to win both a World Series of Poker main event and a World Poker Tour championship, along with Doyle Brunson, Carlos Mortensen, Scotty Nguyen, Dan Harrington and Ryan Riess.\n\nHachem won the \"World Series of Poker Champions II\" tournament on NBC's \"Poker After Dark\" on a table consisting of Main Event winners Doyle Brunson, Greg Raymer, Jamie Gold, Huck Seed, and Johnny Chan, whom he defeated heads up to win $120,000. In 2006, Hachem appeared in Poker Superstars III, but failed to advance to the Super 16 round by only one point. In December 2007, Hachem won the Poker Stars Asia Pacific Poker Tour Tournament of Champions, which included a field of such players as Raymer, Chris Moneymaker and Isabelle Mercier. In April 2008, Hachem came close to the final table of the PokerStars EPT Monte Carlo Grand Final, finish in 11th place for more than $150,000.\n\nHachem finished in 103rd place in the 2009 World Series of Poker Main Event, which drew a field of 6,494 players earning himself $40,288. Also in 2009, Hachem participated in the fifth season of \"High Stakes Poker\", a cash game television series on the Game Show Network. The season featured a buy-in of at least $200,000, the highest minimum requirement in the show's history. Also in 2009, Hachem produced and hosts the Australian reality show \"The Poker Star\", which characterizes Hachem as a poker mentor searching for the next big player. The show features a group of contestants living together in one house and competing in a series of poker-related challenges.\n\nHachem was inducted into the Australian Poker Hall of Fame in 2009 with \"Legend Status\", to which he now serves as Chairman.\n\nAs of 2018, Hachem's total live tournament winnings exceed $12,200,000, more than $7.9 million of which comes from the World Series of Poker events. He is ranked 27th in live poker tournament career earnings by The Hendon Mob, a website which tracks tournament poker players.\n\nHachem said he believes his discipline and control helps him make good decisions at the right time. He credited his success at the 2005 World Series of Poker in part to his ability to make difficult laydowns. Hachem has also advised amateur players against bluffing too often or without any outs. Hachem said he rarely bluffs without any outs, and only does so when \"you're confident the other guy can't stand the heat of a raise.\" Hachem said he tries to maintain the same poker face for each hand. During intense hands, he focuses on a point on the table, keeps his breathing under control and tries not to give away any information. Hachem has said he likes playing at featured tables in televised poker tournaments because, \"Everyone wants to be on TV, and they are afraid to do anything silly so they don't get ridiculed. I try and take advantage of that.\" Hachem's talent and personality has drawn him a large fanbase, and people often surround his table to watch him during tournaments. Hachem is widely regarded as one of the best high-stakes cash game players in Australia.\n\nHachem has been married since 1989 to Jeanie, who he has known since both were teenagers. They have four children named Anthony, Justine, Daniel, and James. Hachem said his wife was extremely supportive of his decision to seek a career in poker and participate in the World Series of Poker in 2005. His children also play poker, and Hachem said he believes it teaches them discipline and how to handle adversity.\n\nHe operates a mortgage company, and enjoys playing golf, especially with friends and other poker players.\n\nUntil December 2011, Hachem represented the online poker website, PokerStars He played under the name \"JoeHachem\" on the site.\n\nActor Matt Damon, who starred in the 1998 poker film \"Rounders\", is a fan of Hachem and has played poker with him. Damon said of Hachem, \"Poker can bring out the worst in people, but when you see somebody who's just winning with grace and class and dignity, it's nice.\"\n\n\n"}

He contested the newly created seat of Daly in the 2001 election against Country Liberal Party (CLP) candidate Tim Baldwin (who had represented the now-abolished seat of Victoria River, which had been redistributed to form Daly), but was unsuccessful.\n\nHe contested Daly again at the 2005 election after Baldwin retired, and was initially thought to have little chance of winning. Daly was a fairly safe CLP seat on paper; after a redistribution, the CLP held it on a notional majority of 9.5 percent. However, on election night the CLP primary vote almost halved, and Knight gained the seat with a swing of 24.6 percent, turning Daly from a safe CLP seat into a safe Labor seat at one stroke. Knight actually won a majority on the first count, allowing him to take the seat from the CLP without the need for preferences. Even considering the size of the Labor wave that swept through the Territory, Knight's victory was considered a shock result, as a swing of this magnitude is almost unheard of at any level in Australia.\n\nKnight was reelected in 2008, but was defeated in 2012 by the CLP's Gary Higgins amid Labor's collapse in the remote portions of the Territory.\n"}

Between London Road and Parkway, two of the four arterial roads to the A3, Stoke Park is the largest park within the town signed area of Guildford. It is also a Green Flag award winning park. The park and its woodland have remained more or less intact since they were laid out in the 18th-century. Then, there was the manor house which owned slightly more land remaining from the manor of Stoke-next-Guildford, complete with walled garden and icehouse.\n\nTo the west of the park is Guildford College. The other side of the college, away from the park, is St John's Church. To the south of the park is Guildford Community Church, Guildford High School and London Road (Guildford) railway station. Surrounding the park to the south and east is the A3100 road. This meets the A25 road, which runs along the north side of the park, in the northeast corner close to the Guildfordian Bisons RFC pitches. To the north of the A25 road is the Guildford Spectrum with which the park shares its facilities.\n\nStoke was originally a parish south of the River Wey. In 1894, it became part of Guildford, when the parish of Stoke was split into two, Stoke-within-Guildford and Stoke-next-Guildford. Before 1762, the site of Stoke Park was called the Paddocks, it was owned by a Mr Dyson who laid out its dimensions. In 1780, it was purchased by a Mr Aldesey. He bought it along with Stoke Mills. The road that later became the A320 Stoke Road/Woking Road was diverted in 1780 to the west end of St. John's Church in Stoke away from Stoke Park. It runs north to south, to the west of the ornamental gardens and the model boating lake in the park. In 1879 Samuel Budgett bought 100 acres of the estate, along with the mansion for £35,000, from Lord Onslow.\n\nIt was home for many years to the Old Guilfordians RFC before their merger with Guildford and Godalming RFC to form Guildford Rugby Club in 2003. Following this, the junior rugby section of the club stayed at Stoke Park under the name of Guildfordians Rugby. They were joined in 2002, by disaffected Old Guildfordians, who had gone to Guildford and Godalming, thus forming Stoke Park Bisons RFC. At the beginning of the 2008–09 Season the RFU allowed the club to become named Guildfordian Bisons RFC, thus forming a link between both the senior and junior sides.\n\nThe Guildford Crows Aussie Rules FC train at Stoke Park during the summer.\n\nStoke Park contains sports pitches, tennis courts, woodland areas, formal gardens, climbing frames, a water cascade, crazy golf course, children's play area with slides, a paddling and model boating pool, concrete skatepark and other large expanses of grass. It is opposite the Guildford Spectrum leisure complex, which has many sports facilities, including, a running track, a swimming pool, bowling alleys and ice rink, the Guildford Spectrum is home to the Guildford Flames ice hockey team.\n\nStoke Park is also home to the annual Surrey County Show held during the second bank holiday weekend in May and a number of other events throughout the year such as the Race for Life and the Surrey County Agricultural Show.\n\nStoke Park was the site of the annual music festival GuilFest, and it holds the annual \"Guildford Lions Firework Fiesta\" on 5 November every year. The event includes many fairground attractions and food stands, and is sponsored by local radio station 96.4 The Eagle. The event starts with a torch lit procession from Guildford High Street and ends with a 20-minute firework finale.\n\nA 5 km run against the clock is organised by the group Parkrun most Saturday mornings.\n\n"}
{"id": "2246245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246245", "title": "Motya", "text": "Motya\n\nMotya was an ancient and powerful city on San Pantaleo Island off the west coast of Sicily, in the Stagnone Lagoon between Drepanum (modern Trapani) and Lilybaeum (modern Marsala). It is within the present-day commune of Marsala, Italy. \n\nMany of the city's impressive ancient monuments have been excavated and can be admired today.\n\nMotya has become known recently for the marble statue of the Motya Charioteer, found in 1979 and on display at the local Giuseppe Whitaker museum.\n\nThe Carthaginian settlement was written in their abjad as () or (, \"Motye\"). The name seems to derive from the Phoenician triliteral root , which would give it the meaning of \"a wool-spinning center\".\n\nMotya is the latinization of the island's Greek name, variously written \"Motýa\" () or \"Motýē\" (). The Greeks claimed the place was named for a woman named Motya whom they connected with the myths around Hercules. The town's Italian name appears as both and ; its Sicilian name is .\n\nThe island first received the name in the 11th century from Basilian monks.\n\nThe island is nearly long and wide, and about (six stadia) from the mainland of Sicily. It was joined to the mainland in ancient times by a causeway, over which chariots with large wheels could reach the town.\n\nThe foundation of the city probably dates from the eighth centuryBC, about a century after the foundation of Carthage in Tunisia. It was originally a colony of the Phoenicians, who were fond of choosing similar sites, and probably in the first instance merely a commercial station or emporium, but gradually rose to be a flourishing and important town. The Phoenicians transformed the inhospitable island into one of the most affluent cities of its time, naturally defended by the lagoon as well as high defensive walls. Ancient windmills and salt pans were used for evaporation, salt grinding and refinement, and to maintain the condition of the lagoon and island itself. Recently the mills and salt pans (called the \"Ettore Infersa\") have been restored by the owners and opened to the public.\n\nIn common with the other Phoenician settlements in Sicily, it passed under the government or dependency of Carthage, whence Diodorus calls it a Carthaginian colony; but it is probable that this is not strictly correct.\n\nAs the Greek colonies in Sicily increased in numbers and importance the Phoenicians gradually abandoned their settlements in the immediate neighbourhood of the newcomers, and concentrated themselves in the three principal colonies of Soluntum, Panormus (modern Palermo), and Motya. The last of these, from its proximity to Carthage and its opportune situation for communication with North Africa, as well as the natural strength of its position, became one of the chief strongholds of the Carthaginians, as well as one of the most important of their commercial cities in the island. It appears to have held, in both these respects, the same position which was attained at a later period by Lilybaeum.\n\nNotwithstanding these accounts of its early importance and flourishing condition, the name of Motya is rarely mentioned in history until just before the period of its memorable siege. It is first mentioned by Hecataeus of Miletus, and Thucydides notices it among the chief colonies of the Phoenicians in Sicily which existed at the time of the Athenian expedition, 415 BC. A few years later (409 BC) when the Carthaginian army under Hannibal Mago landed at the promontory of Lilybaeum, that general laid up his fleet for security in the gulf around Motya, while he advanced with his land forces along the coast to attack Selinus. After the fall of the latter city, we are told that Hermocrates, the Syracusan exile, who had established himself on its ruins with a numerous band of followers, laid waste the territories of Motya and Panormus; and again during the second expedition of the Carthaginians under Hamilcar (407 BC), these two cities became the permanent station of the Carthaginian fleet.\n\nIt was the important position to which Motya had thus attained that led Dionysius I of Syracuse to direct his principal efforts to its reduction, when in 397 BC he in his turn invaded the Carthaginian territory in Sicily. The citizens on the other hand, relying on succour from Carthage, made preparations for a vigorous resistance; and by cutting off the causeway which united them to the mainland, compelled Dionysius to have recourse to the tedious and laborious process of constructing a mound or mole of earth across the intervening space. Even when this was accomplished, and the military engines of Dionysius (among which the formidable catapult on this occasion made its appearance for the first time) were brought up to the walls, the Motyans continued a desperate resistance; and after the walls and towers were carried by the overwhelming forces of the enemy, still maintained the defence from street to street and from house to house. This obstinate struggle only increased the previous exasperation of the Sicilian Greeks against the Carthaginians; and when at length the troops of Dionysius made themselves masters of the city, they put the whole surviving population, men, women, and children, to the sword.\n\nAfter this, the Syracusan despot placed it in charge of a garrison under an officer named Biton, while his brother Leptines of Syracuse made it the station of his fleet. But the next spring (396 BC) Himilcon, the Carthaginian general, having landed at Panormus with a very large force, recovered possession of Motya with comparatively little difficulty. Motya, however, was not destined to recover its former importance; for Himilcon, being apparently struck with the superior advantages of Lilybaeum, founded a new city on the promontory of that name, to which he transferred the few remaining inhabitants of Motya.\n\nFrom this period the latter altogether disappears from history; and the little islet on which it was built, has probably ever since, as now, been inhabited only by a few fishermen. By the time the Romans conquered Sicily, during the First Punic War (264–241 BC), Motya had been eclipsed by Lilybaeum.\n\nIt is a singular fact that, though we have no account of Motya having received any Greek population, or fallen into the hands of the Greeks before its conquest by Dionysius, there exist coins of the city with the Greek legend \"ΜΟΤΥΑΙΟΝ\". They are, however, of great rarity, and are apparently imitated from those of the neighboring city of Segesta.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Basilian monks settled on the island and renamed it San Pantaleo, and in 1888 was rediscovered by Joseph Whitaker.\n\nThe site of Motya, on which earlier geographers were in much doubt, has been clearly identified and described by William Henry Smyth. Between the promontory of Lilybaeum (Capo Boéo) and that of Aegithallus (San Teodoro), the coast forms a deep bight, in front of which lies a long group of low rocky islets, called the Stagnone. Within these, and considerably nearer to the mainland, lies the small island formerly called San Pantaleo, on which the remains of an ancient city may still be distinctly traced. Fragments of the walls, with those of two gateways, still exist, and coins as well as pieces of ancient brick and pottery – the never failing indications of an ancient site – were found scattered throughout the island. The circuit of the latter does not exceed 2.5 km, and it is inhabited only by a few fishermen; but is not devoid of fertility. The confined space on which the city was built agrees with the description of Diodorus that the houses were lofty and of solid construction, with narrow streets () between them, which facilitated the desperate defence of the inhabitants.\n\nThe island of Mozia is owned and operated by the Whitaker Foundation (Palermo), famous for Marsala wines. Tours are available for the small museum, and the well-preserved ruins of a crossroads civilisation: in addition to the cultures mentioned above, Motian artifacts display Egyptian, Corinthian, Attic, Roman, Punic and Hellenic influences. The Tophet, a type of cemetery for the cremated remains of children, possibly (but not entirely proven) as sacrifice to Tanit or Ba‘al Hammon, is also well known. Many of the ancient residences are open to the public, with guided tours in English and Italian.\n\nThe beautiful Motya Charioteer sculpture found in 1979 is on display at the Giuseppe Whitaker museum. It is a rare example of a victor of a chariot race who must have been very wealthy in order to commission such a work. It was found built into Phoenician fortifications which were quickly erected before Dionysios I of Syracuse invaded and sacked Motya in 397 BC.\n\nIts superb quality implies that it was made by a leading Greek artist in the period following their defeat of the Persians, but its style is unlike any other of this period. It is believed it must have been looted from a Greek city conquered by Carthage in 409-405 BC.\n\nIn March 2006, archaeological digs uncovered rooms of a previously undiscovered house at one of the town's siege walls. The finds have shown that the town had a \"thriving population long after it is commonly believed to have been destroyed by the Ancient Greeks.\" Discovered items include cooking pans, Phoenician-style vases, altars, and looms.\n\nThe 399 BC Battle of Motya, part of the war of Syracuse's tyrant Dionysios I against Carthage is a major event in the 1965 historical novel \"The Arrows of Hercules\" by L. Sprague de Camp.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2246250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246250", "title": "Operation Crevice", "text": "Operation Crevice\n\nOperation Crevice was a raid launched by Metropolitan and local police in England on the morning of 30 March 2004. It was in response to a report indicating cells of terrorists of Pakistani origin operating in the Thames Valley, Sussex, Surrey and Bedfordshire areas, the source of which was said to be an interception of an instruction sent from Al-Qaeda leaders in Pakistan to militants in Britain. In March 2020 Jonathan Evans, Former Director General, MI5 gave an interview and citing one passage: 'The plot itself, however, appeared to be encouraged and fomented by al-Qa`ida in the tribal areas. It was one of the early ones we saw. It involved predominantly British citizens or British residents of Pakistani heritage, something which became something of a theme for this period'.. The operation resulted in five men being found guilty in April 2007 of conspiring to cause explosions likely to endanger life.\n\nA number of arrests were made, and 1,300 pounds (600 kg) of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, which can be used to make bombs, were confiscated. The chemical was seized in a storage space in Hanwell in west London.\n\nAt least six homes in Langley Green, Crawley, were searched, and an area was excavated at one site. A biscuit tin filled with aluminium powder, another potential bomb ingredient, was recovered behind a garden shed.\n\nThe arrest of software engineer Momin Khawaja on 29 March 2004, in Ottawa, Canada, was reportedly related to Operation Crevice. He was reportedly experimenting with remote-controlled detonators.\n\nThe court case against the men began in March 2006 and lasted till April 30, 2007. The jury was out for 27 days. The accused were named as:\n\nMohammad Momin Khawaja, in life imprisonment in Canada, was the eighth man charged with being involved in the plot. A ninth man, Mohammed Junaid Babar, was the prosecution's star witness. An alleged leader of this group was a man named Mohammed Quayyum Khan who was an alleged associate of both Abu Hamza and Omar Bakri. \nMohammed Quayyum Khan (or \"Q\" as he was called by the group and the courts) was apparently still at large after the police, inexplicably, failed to arrest him.\n\nThe court case was based mainly on the evidence of so-called supergrass (informant) Mohammed Junaid Babar, who was found guilty of terrorist offences in the United States. The counsel for the defence called this witness \"a liar, nothing more than a conceited fantasist.\"\n\nThe BBC reported that potential targets included the Bluewater shopping centre in Greenhithe, Kent, the Ministry of Sound nightclub in London and London synagogues.\n\nMohammed Junaid Babar was the prosecution's star witness. He was flown to London to give evidence in the case, and arrived at court amid heavy security, driven from a police station in an armoured convoy with a helicopter overhead.\n\nThe prosecution claimed that he was part of the plot and had \"an insight as an insider into the events and plans, which an outsider could not have.\"\n\nHe was given immunity from prosecution in relation to the charges the British defendants face.\n\nHe claims to have stolen three computers from a software company he worked for in Peshawar and given them to Mahmood because they were needed by Al Qaeda. The company was run by the older brother of one of the founder members of al-Muhajiroun.\n\nThe trial began in March 2006, and the prosecution ran its charges until the end of August. The allegations brought up by the witness testimony and evidence included the following:\n\n\nOmar Khyam's defence testimony began with him telling the court of his gradual conversion to militant jihadist and wish to help the fighters in Kashmir and Afghanistan.\n\nThen, on 18 September, to the surprise of his defence counsel, Khyam refused to give any more evidence, stating that the ISI in Pakistan has had words with his family and were worried that he might reveal more about them. He added: \"right now, as much as I want to clarify matters, the priority for me has to be the safety of my family so I am going to stop.\" He assured the judge that he understood that his refusal to answer questions might cause the jury to be suspicious.\n\nSalahuddin Amin's testimony consisted of claims that he had been tortured by his Pakistani jailers during his 10-month detention, and that this must have been known to the US and British officials who interviewed him numerous times during his detention. He said he confessed to being involved in a plot to buy an \"isotope bomb\" after being hung up by his wrists and beaten on his back and \"things\" with the lashes, and threatened to be raped by the handle.\n\nNabeel Hussain, who loaned the money to pay for the storage of ammonium nitrate, claimed he thought it was sand.\n\nCounsel for Shujah Mahmood, who was only 16 at the time of the events, claimed he was not aware of the plot and was merely taken advantage of by his older brother.\nJudge Sir Michael Astill announced on 20 April 2007 that he would accept a majority verdict in the case. On 30 April, Omar Khyam, Waheed Mahmood, Jawad Akbar, Salahuddin Amin, and Anthony Garcia were found guilty of conspiring to cause explosions likely to endanger life between 1 January 2003 and 31 March 2004. Shujah Mahmood and Nabeel Hussain were found not guilty of all charges.\n\nThe defendants found guilty were sentenced to life imprisonment. Omar Khyam was given a minimum term of 20 years, Anthony Garcia 20 years, Jawad Akbar 17½ years, Waheed Mahmood 20 years and Salahuddin Amin 17½ years.\n\nMomin Khawaja was found guilty in Canada’s first terrorism trial on charges of helping to develop bomb detonators, possession of explosives, helping to finance terrorist activity, receiving terrorist training and facilitating terrorism. On March 12, 2009 he was sentenced to 10.5 years in prison which was later increased to Life-24.\n\nAn organisation associated with the attacks is the group al-Muhajiroun. According to the BBC, some of the perpetrators became interested in jihad during the time they were involved with al-Muhajiroun. According to Professor Anthony Glees, director of the Brunel Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies – The fertiliser bomb trial has given us the smoking-gun evidence that groups like al-Muhajiroun have had an important part in radicalising young British Muslims, and that this can create terrorists.\n\nAl-Muhajiroun was disbanded by its founder Omar Bakri Mohammed in 2004. Shortly after 7 July 2005 London bombings, Prime Minister Tony Blair \"announced the group would be banned as part of a series of measures against condoning or glorifying terrorism.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2246253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246253", "title": "Liverpool Speedway", "text": "Liverpool Speedway\n\nLiverpool Speedway (also known during its life as Liverpool International Speedway and Liverpool City Raceway) was located in Green Valley, Western Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Liverpool was officially opened by Frank Oliveri and the Oliveri Family, alongside Ald. E. Smith, the mayor of Liverpool at the time, and ran until its sudden and unexpected closure in 1989. Frank Oliveri would later share track management with track announcer and promoter, Channel 7 television sports presenter Mike Raymond.\n\nThe builder of the race circuit is named Douglas Charles Barrett.\n\nLiverpool Speedway was officially opened by the Oliveri Family on 14 May 1967. The track was D-shaped and was a clay-and-dolomite mix. On the program that first night were Speedcars, TQ's, super modifieds, stock cars and production sedans.\n\nLiverpool was managed and promoted by Channel 7 television sports presenter Mike Raymond and former Liverpool Mayor Frank Oliveri. The speedway was promoted heavily on television and radio. With television personality Raymond in charge, Liverpool was perhaps the best-promoted speedway in Australia during the mid-1970s and through the 1980s.\n\nDuring the winter of 1974, the management of the speedway announced that the track surface was being changed from clay and dolomite to asphalt. At this time the venue had its first name change when it became known as the \"Liverpool International Speedway\". Also announced at the time were extensive renovations including a fully enclosed grandstand with a glass-enclosed restaurant, a VIP lounge and a 3-storey control tower, all aimed at increasing the track's spectator capacity to around 35,000. The track was paved in time for the 1974/75 season, but the other proposed works never got off the ground.\n\nLiverpool Speedway's biggest annual event was the Marlboro Grand National 100 Lap race which was first run in 1971 and won by local driver Rick Hunter. The race became the home of specialist pavement racing cars which eventually became known as Grand National's. This event attracted drivers from all around Australia and the United States making it the most prestigious sedan based speedway event ever hosted in Australia at the time other than the annual National Championships and crowds of up to 25,000 people would attend this event.\n\nGrand National Sedans were a new breed of cars developed especially for Liverpool Raceway, though some were easily adapted for the many dirt track speedways around Australia. They were a tube spaceframe chassis with a fuel injected small block V8 engine, similar to a Sprintcar engine and although designed primarily for racing on Liverpool's paved oval the cars competed on dirt or clay around the country including at the Newcastle Motordrome north of Sydney, Parramatta City Raceway in western Sydney, Rowley Park and later Speedway Park in Adelaide, Claremont Speedway in Perth, Premier Speedway in Warrnambool, and Archerfield Speedway in Brisbane.\n\nOne of the speedway management's biggest promotions was to annually bring a team of four sedan drivers from America to race at Liverpool in test Matches against the Australian drivers. American drivers such as Gene Welch, \"Big Ed\" Wilbur and Rodney Combs became regulars in Australia and the action on the track was often described as \"World Championship Wrestling on Wheels\". The test matches took place both on the dirt track and the pavement with the usually good natured crowd totally against the visiting Americans.\n\nDespite the change in track surface from dirt to asphalt, Speedcars, Sprintcars and other car categories continued to race at the speedway with the track hosting the Australian Speedcar Championship in 1976 and a round of the three race 1977 Australian championship.\n\nIn 1975, Mike Raymond and his promotions partner Frank Oliveri attracted then three time Indy 500 champion A. J. Foyt and fellow Indy racer Mel Kenyon to Liverpool to race in VW powered Speedcars in the 21st Australian Speedcar Grand Prix. Foyt passed Kenyon for the lead in mid-race after Kenyon almost spun on oil and tapped the fence. Kenyon still finished 2nd while the USA made it a 1-4 result with Larry Rice and Garry Patterson being the only other drivers to finish on the lead lap. The attendance for the Grand Prix was around 10,000.\n\nFoyt returned to Liverpool for the 22nd Australian Grand Prix in 1976 along with fellow Indy 500 winner Johnny Rutherford and fellow Americans Ron \"Sleepy\" Tripp and Hank Butcher. All four Americans, along with most of the field, drove the VW powered cars. A.J. Foyt was again the winner this time passing local hero and National Champion George Tatnell in the dying laps. Tatnell was driving his controversial Winfield sponsored \"Wedge\" Speedcar powered by an off-set Offenhauser engine. Despite Tatnell's over 10 years of racing speedway until that point, his relative inexperience at running on paved ovals compared to Foyt showed when his tyres went off while Foyt was able to keep his tyres fresh enough to push harder in the final laps.\n\nLiverpool, which was renamed in 1980 to become the \"Liverpool City Raceway\", continued to run the Australian Speedcar Grand Prix on both the asphalt and dirt until 1988 with such winners as 10 time Australian Sprintcar Champion Garry Rush in 1977, Ron \"Sleepy\" Tripp of the United States in 1983 and 1984, and after the track had reverted to a clay surface, World of Outlaws legend Steve Kinser would swap his Sprintcar for a Speedcar and win in 1986.\n\nStock Saloons were also a favourite at the track. The cars had to be a pre-1968 production car and they raced the track in a Clockwise direction. In Speedway, either on dirt or bitumen, almost every class of car and the Solo bikes race oval tracks Anti-clockwise. Squealing tyres would become the norm at Liverpool in its 10-year run as a paved speedway.\n\nWhen it was decided to pave the Speedway in 1974 it was also decided to build a , dolomite and dirt based motorcycle track on the inside of the pavement track so as to keep both cars and bikes on the same race program. As the new track had no outside safety fence, speedway management had to get special dispensation from the NSW Government to build the track as the NSW Speedway Act stated that no speedway could run without a safety fence. The new track a distinct camber and had two straights due to the back straight being not following the \"D\" curve of the main track (this also saw the spectators on the back straight about 30 metres back from the track). Previous to this, Solos and sidecars had been run at Liverpool on the main track since the tracks opening after local rider Gordon Guasco convinced Speedway Manager Oliveri to put bikes on the program. Guasco was to lose his life at the track in a crash on 8 November 1970. \n\nThe infield motorcycle track hosted many world class solo and sidecar riders during its life, with solo riders like local stars Billy Sanders, John Langfield, Phil Herne, Garry Middleton and Gary Guglielmi mixing it with interstate stars such as Phil Crump, John Boulger and John Titman. Also, World Champions such as Ivan Mauger (New Zealand), Ole Olsen and Hans Nielsen (Denmark) and Americans Bruce Penhall, Bobby Schwartz, Dennis Sigalos and Shawn Moran regularly raced at Liverpool when competing in Australia.\n\nIn 1976, Ole Olsen, the reigning World Champion, won the only Australian Solo Championship held at Liverpool, to date the last time a non-Australian won the national title. This was despite protests from other riders who did not believe the Dane should have been eligible to ride in an Australian Championship meeting.\n\nIn a major win for the Liverpool City Raceway management and promoters, the track was awarded the 1982 Speedway World Pairs Championship Final. It would prove to be the only time in the 26 years of the World Pairs Championship (1968-1993) that it was ever been held outside of England or Europe. The championship was won by Dennis Sigalos and Bobby Schwartz representing the United States. The pair finished unbeaten over their six heats with Sigalos winning each and Schwartz 2nd each time giving them a 5-1 advantage in each race. They finished on a perfect 30 points (Sigalos 18, Schwartz 12) ahead of Englands Peter Collins and Kenny Carter on 22 (Collins 15, Carter 7) and Denmarks Hans Nielsen and Ole Olsen in third on 21 points (Nielsen 11, Olsen 10). Host nation Australia, represented by local Liverpool riders Billy Sanders (the reigning Australian Champion) and Gary Guglielmi, finished in fourth place on 16 points (Sanders 11, Guglielmi 5). 1982 would prove to be the only time in World Pairs Final history that a pair have won with the maximum possible score.\n\nFollowing the 1983/84 speedway season the pavement was torn up and the dirt was re-introduced with clay as the main surface, though the bikes continued on their own track as the main tracks clay surface was not suitable for bikes. The Grand Nationals were still popular, but Sprintcars were fast becoming Australia's most popular speedway division. Also popular at Liverpool and through NSW and Queensland was a class known as Compact Speedcars.\n\nLiverpool also had a BMX track at the south western end of the venue and hosted many international events. The BMX track was known as \"Metro West\" BMX track. In the early 1980s, a group of American riders toured and raced at the venue.\n\nBy 1989 the speedway was under threat by the so-called urban sprawl, and this led to the reluctant closure of the venue to make way for new housing and a shopping complex now known as the Valley Plaza. \nWith the Sydney Showground Speedway at Moore Park not hosting weekly meetings after the 1979/80 season, and Liverpool closing in 1989, this left the more Sprintcar focused Parramatta City Raceway at Granville (opened in 1977) as Sydney's only active major speedway. The bikes continued racing at the poorly attended Nepean Speedway in north western outskirts of Sydney, but otherwise many Sydney based riders such as Craig Boyce, Mick Poole and Stephen Davies were forced to use the popular Newcastle Motordrome as their home track. The Motordrome, which itself closed in 2002, was located approximately 175 km (108 mi) north of Sydney in Newcastle. Currently most Sydney and NSW riders use the motorcycle only Loxford Park Speedway in Kurri Kurri as their home track.\n\n\n\n"}

It was a linguistic blend of Church Slavonic of the Russian recension, vernacular Serbian (Shtokavian dialect), and Russian.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, the literary language of the Serbs was the Serbian recension of Church Slavonic (also called Serbo-Slavonic), with centuries-old tradition. After the Great Serb Migration of 1690, many Serbs left Ottoman-held territories and settled in southern areas of the Kingdom of Hungary in the Habsburg Empire, mostly in what is now Vojvodina. The Serbian Orthodox Church in these areas was in need of liturgical books, and the Serbian schools were in need of textbooks. The Habsburg court, however, did not allow the Serbs to establish their printing presses. The Serbian Church and schools received ample help in books and teachers from the Russian Empire. By the mid-18th century, Serbo-Slavonic had been mostly replaced with Russo-Slavonic (Russian recension of Church Slavonic) as the principal literary language of the Serbs.\n\nAround that time, laymen became more numerous and notable than monks and priests among active Serbian writers. The secular writers wanted their works to be closer to the general Serbian readership, but at the same time, most of them regarded Church Slavonic as more prestigious and elevated than the popular Serbian language. Church Slavonic was also identified with the Proto-Slavic language, and its use in literature was seen as the continuation of an ancient tradition. The writers began blending Russo-Slavonic, vernacular Serbian, and Russian, and the resulting mixed language is called Slavonic-Serbian. The first printed work in Slavonic-Serbian appeared in 1768, written by Zaharije Orfelin. Before that, a German–Slavonic-Serbian dictionary was composed in the 1730s. The blended language became dominant in secular Serbian literature and publications during the 1780s and 1790s. At the beginning of the 19th century, it was severely attacked by Vuk Karadžić and his followers, whose reformatory efforts formed modern literary Serbian based on the popular language. The last notable work in Slavonic-Serbian was published in 1825.\n\nSlavonic-Serbian was used in literary works, including prose and poetry, school textbooks, philological and theological works, popular scientific and practical books, and other kinds of publications. Various laws, decisions, and proclamations by the Habsburg authorities were printed in Slavonic-Serbian, in which also the first Serbian newspapers, \"Serbskija novini\", appeared in 1791. Other periodicals include \"Slaveno-serbskij Magazin\" (1768) and \"Slaveno-serbskija vědomosti\" (1792–94), as well as the later \"Novine serbske iz carstvujuščega grada Vienne\" (1814–1817). A bidirectional German–Serbian dictionary (1791), with around 20,000 headwords in each direction, was composed by adapting a German–Russian dictionary into Slavonic-Serbian.\n\nSlavonic-Serbian texts exhibit lexical, phonological, morphological, and syntactical blending of Russo-Slavonic, vernacular Serbian, and, to a lesser degree, Russian; hybrid words are common. There are no definite rules determining how to combine elements from these languages. It mostly depends on the writer's linguistic attitude and the subject he writes about. So, in an Italian grammar written by Vikentije Ljuština, objects of everyday use are usually referred to by their Serbian names, while Russo-Slavonic names are used for religious holidays. During the short existence of Slavonic-Serbian, some forms became more or less standard, and the share of vernacular Serbian elements grew in it. Some authors argue that the application of Russo-Slavonic, Serbian, and Russian elements in a given work was regulated by stylistic conventions. In an individual sentence, the word stems or affixes could be either predominantly Serbian, or predominantly Russo-Slavonic, or combined in any other ratio. A sentence in the newspapers \"Slaveno-serbskija vědomosti\", written by Stefan Novaković, is an example of elements from both languages being equally used, regarding both stems and affixes:\n\n"}

{"id": "2246309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246309", "title": "Rudy Pompilli", "text": "Rudy Pompilli\n\nRudolph Clement Pompilii (April 16, 1924 – February 5, 1976) was an American musician best known for playing tenor saxophone with Bill Haley and His Comets. He was usually credited under the alternate spelling Rudy Pompilli and occasionally as Rudy Pell.\n\nPompilli was born in Chester, Pennsylvania. Occasional sources spell his first name as \"Rudi\", although Pompilli himself never used this form.\n\nPompilli was skilled at playing both saxophone and clarinet, and spent the beginning of his career playing in jazz bands. In 1953 he was with the Ralph Marterie Orchestra. That orchestra coincidentally scored a hit with a cover version of Haley's \"Crazy Man, Crazy\", though research by Haley historian Chris Gardner found no evidence that Pompilli performed on that recording.\n\nPompilli was invited to join the Comets in September 1955, after Haley's previous sax player, Joey Ambrose quit along with two other Comets to form The Jodimars. According to Haley, the young horn player had a dislike for rock and roll musicians, but he nonetheless accepted the offer. Ambrose gave Pompilli a crash course in the Haley style of saxophone playing, and he also learned the stage antics pioneered by Ambrose and bass player Marshall Lytle, including playing the sax while lying flat on his back and jumping all over the bass player. (Lytle also left for the Jodimars and was replaced by Al Rex.)\n\nAt Haley's request, the new band member changed the spelling of his last name from \"Pompilii\" to \"Pompilli\", as Haley was concerned that the former looked like a typographical error. Pompilli also frequently used the alias \"Rudy Pell\" and many of his autographs from the 1950s have this name rather than Pompilli.\n\nWithin a few months of joining The Comets, Pompilli had become the band's most visible member (aside from Haley himself), becoming the focus of \"Rudy's Rock\", a show-stopping instrumental co-written by Pompilli and Haley that debuted in the 1956 film \"Rock Around the Clock\". When released as a single, \"Rudy's Rock\" reached #34 on the \"Billboard\" singles chart and #38 on the Cashbox Top Singles list, spending 4 weeks on that chart, and making it the first instrumental record of the rock and roll era to chart. Other acclaimed, but less commercially successful instrumentals followed, most notably \"Calling All Comets\" which was performed in the band's next film, 1957's \"Don't Knock the Rock\".\n\nIn 1958, Rudy's cousin, Al Pompilli, joined the Comets for a year, playing bass after the departure of Al Rex.\n\nRudy Pompilli co-wrote the hit \"Week End\" with Franny Beecher and Billy Williamson, which reached No. 35 on the Billboard pop chart when released as a single in 1958 as by The Kingsmen on East West Records, East West 115. He also co-wrote the B-side, \"Better Believe It\", with Johnny Grande and Ralph Jones. A follow-up single was released on East West, \"Conga Rock\", written by drummer Ralph Jones, backed with \"The Catwalk\", written by Franny Beecher and Billy Williamson, as East West 120. Pompelli composed the hit \"Florida Twist\" with Anthony Caruso, which reached No. 3 as an Orfeon 45 on the Mexican pop singles chart in 1962 based on the Billboard Hits of the World chart. \"Florida Twist\" has since become a party standard in Latin America and has been covered by many artists in rock and roll, Tex-Mex and other genres.\n\nBill Haley's band would undergo many changes of personnel over the next two decades, but the one constant was Rudy Pompilli, who would become the band's road manager, taking care of paying the bills and arranging for the hiring of new musicians when required. (Pompilli did briefly quit the Comets during 1960-61 and was replaced by Al Dean, but soon returned to the band.) Pompilli also did solo work, performing regularly in Philadelphia area night clubs, either by himself or with members of the Comets.\n\nSoon after a 1974 tour of Europe, Pompilli was diagnosed with lung cancer. He was not a smoker himself, and is believed to have contracted the disease through passive smoking. The ailing musician continued to tour with Haley throughout 1975 (including a tour of Brazil in October 1975), and that year also recorded his first and only solo album, \"Rudy's Rock: The Sax That Changed the World\", which was recorded with session musicians and members of The Comets. He also continued to perform at the Nite Cap, a club in Chester, Pennsylvania; at one of his very last performances he performed with his former Comets bandmate Franny Beecher as well as then-current Comets guitarist Bill Turner.\n\nPompilli died from lung cancer on February 5, 1976, in Philadelphia. His death affected Haley deeply. After fulfilling touring commitments for the year with a replacement sax player, at the end of 1976 Haley announced his retirement from performing and moved full-time to Mexico. Haley would return to touring and recording in 1979 and would dedicate a part of every show to Pompilli's memory with a performance of \"Rudy's Rock\".\n\nDuring research for an article on the 30th anniversary of Pompilli's death, researcher Chris Gardner uncovered documents that showed Pompilli was actually born in 1924, not 1926 as had commonly been believed (like Haley, Pompilli also shaved two years off his age).\n\nHe was named Sax Player of the Year by \"Down Beat\" magazine in 1957.\n\nIn 2012, Pompilli was inducted as a member of the Comets into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by a special committee, aimed at correcting the previous mistake of not inducting the band with Bill Haley in 1987.\n\nHe co-wrote \"Week End\" with Franny Beecher and Billy Williamson and the B side, \"Better Believe It\", with Johnny Grande and Ralph Jones. He co-wrote \"Rudy's Rock\" with Bill Haley and \"Calling All Comets\" with Bill Haley and Milt Gabler. He co-wrote \"Hey Then, There Now\" with Ralph Jones. He wrote \"Florida Twist\" with Anthony Caruso. He also co-wrote \"Lean Jean\".\nHis other compositions were \"China Twist\", \"Happy Twist\", \"Tacos de Twist\", and \"Twist del Dia\" in 1962.\n\n"}
{"id": "2246318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246318", "title": "Lutheran Churches of the Reformation", "text": "Lutheran Churches of the Reformation\n\nThe Lutheran Churches of the Reformation (LCR) is an association of Lutheran congregations. The LCR has its roots among groups of Lutherans that broke with the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) in the middle of the 20th century, and was formally incorporated in 1964. Church services are generally traditional and reverent in the style of the mid-1900s conservative Christians.\n\nThe Lutheran Churches of the Reformation teach that the Bible is the only authoritative and error-free source for doctrine. It subscribes to the Lutheran Confessions (the Book of Concord) not in-so-far-as but because it is an accurate presentation of what Scripture teaches. It teaches that Jesus is the center of Scripture and the only way to eternal salvation, and that the Holy Spirit uses the gospel alone in Word and Sacraments (Baptism and Holy Communion) to bring people to faith in Jesus as Savior and keep them in that faith, strengthening them in their daily life of sanctification.\n\nThe doctrine of the Lutheran Churches of the Reformation is summarized in Franz August Otto Pieper's Brief Statement of the Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod and Wallace H. McLaughlin's We All Believe in One True God: A Summary of Biblical Doctrine.\n\nThe Lutheran Churches of the Reformation publishes \"One Accord\", a monthly devotional and news magazine, and \"The Faithful Word\", a quarterly theological journal.\n\nThe Martin Luther Institute of Sacred Studies in Decatur, Indiana, is the seminary and teacher's college of the LCR.\n\nThe LCR is governed through annual conventions where delegates of the congregations vote. Doctrinal resolutions must be unanimous, or those in the minority will be suspended from the LCR. The day-to-day business of the LCR is run by the Council, whose members are elected to three year terms, commissions, and committees.\n\nFor missions, the LCR has a missionary-at-large to serve those who have moved away from their congregations and other like-minded Lutherans. Abroad, the LCR supports congregations in Nigeria and Kenya and has trained pastors for the Lutheran Churches of the Reformation in Nigeria. The LCR has also held seminars to train pastors in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nAs of March 2009, about 1,300 people are baptized members of \"LCR\" congregations.\n\nThe congregations in the LCR and the Concordia Lutheran Conference were organized as the Orthodox Lutheran Conference (OLC), in 1951. The OLC split in 1956 after Prof. Paul E. Kretzmann suspended church-fellowship with some congregations after they charged him with teaching error in class. These congregations formed the Concordia Lutheran Conference, while the others, along with Kretzmann, joined with more conservatives leaving the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod to organize as the LCR.\n\nThe LCR discussed church-fellowship with the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod in the 1960s, but declared that the differences regarding the doctrine of Church and Ministry were divisive of church-fellowship in July 1970.\n\nThe Fellowship of Lutheran Congregations (FLC), is a group of congregations that left the LCR in 1979 after a dispute concerning the proper procedure of excommunication. The congregations of the FLC joined the Concordia Lutheran Conference circa 2004.\n\nFor a time in the 1990s, the LCR was in official church-fellowship with the Illinois Lutheran Conference (ILC). The ILC was organized in 1979 after three congregations left the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod in protest when a pastor was suspended because of claims he made regarding the King James Version of the Bible. There was controversy between the ILC and the LCR'regarding the \"appearance of evil\" (1 Thessalonians 5:22) and the doctrine of Church and Ministry. The LCR severed the fellowship because of differences discovered during the controversy over the \"appearance of evil\".\n\nIn February 2006, five congregations and four pastors suspended church-fellowship with the rest of the LCR when, in the wake of a disagreement regarding the doctrine of the ministry, an LCR congregation was dissolved through legal action by certain members, most of whom were female, who disagreed with their pastor. This led to accusations of female suffrage by one side and legalism by the other. The LCR was never asked by both sides of the congregation to adjudicate the division. The congregations that suspended fellowship in February 2006 withdrew their membership from the LCR in April 2006 after a special convention called to address the controversy refused to discuss the matter of female suffrage and the aforementioned dissolution. A position paper titled \"The Ministry and Auxiliary Office with Respect to Legalism\" that was presented at that conference in an attempt to resolve the controversy has since been adopted unanimously by the remaining congregations of the LCR. Another LCR position paper titled \"Liberty or Death\" written to draw attention to different kinds of legalism was subsequently adopted in July 2007. Those congregations that withdrew membership with the LCR have declared church-fellowship with each other and have since organized the Orthodox Lutheran Confessional Conference (OLCC). A sixth congregation, in Hudson, Michigan, later withdrew from the LCR over the same issues, and remains independent.\n\nThe LCR believes that the local congregation is the only divinely ordained church organization, and does not refer to synods or denominations as churches. This separates the group from some other conservative Lutherans such as the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod.\n\nThe congregations of the LCR use the King James Version of the Bible for all public uses, the 1943 \"Blue\" edition of Luther's Small Catechism in confirmation instruction, and The Lutheran Hymnal of 1941. The LCR does not, however, hold to the King James Only position, since it recognizes the traditional Hebrew and Greek, for the Old and New Testaments respectively, to be authoritative over any translation.\n\nIn 1990, the LCR passed a resolution titled \"Procreation\" stating that birth control, in all forms, is sin, although the denomination \"allow(s) for\"...\"exceptional cases (casuistry)\", for example, when the woman's life or health is at risk.\n\nCongregations of the LCR follow 1 Timothy 2:12 in practicing male-only suffrage in congregational voter's assemblies. This represents alignment with the most conservative Lutheran bodies in the U.S., and departs significantly from its parent body, the LCMS, which permits its congregations local discretion on the matter.\n\nThe Lutheran Churches of the Reformation, hold to \"Brief Statement\" of 1932, which confirms the long-held traditional beliefs of the Lutheran Church as documented in the Book of Concord, including: inerrency of Scripture, Divine creation in six days, a young earth, the divine institution of the local congregation, the divine institution of the local office of the ministry, closed fellowship, and of the antichrist.\n\n"}

This is also known as the 1988 Basel Accord, and was enforced by law in the Group of Ten (G-10) countries in 1992. A new set of rules known as Basel II was later developed with the intent to supersede the Basel I accords. However they were criticized by some for allowing banks to take on additional types of risk, which was considered part of the cause of the US subprime financial crisis that started in 2008. In fact, bank regulators in the United States took the position of requiring a bank to follow the set of rules (Basel I or Basel II) giving the more conservative approach for the bank. Because of this it was anticipated that only the few very largest US banks would operate under the Basel II rules, the others being regulated under the Basel I framework. Basel III was developed in response to the financial crisis; it does not supersede either Basel I or II but focuses on different issues primarily related to the risk of a bank run.\n\nThe Committee was formed in response to the messy liquidation of Cologne-based Herstatt Bank in 1974.\nOn 26 June 1974 a number of banks had released Deutschmarks (the German currency) to the Herstatt Bank in exchange for dollar payments deliverable in New York City. Due to differences in the time zones, there was a lag in the dollar payment to the counterparty banks; during this lag period, before the dollar payments could be effected in New York, the Herstatt Bank was liquidated by German regulators.\n\nThis incident prompted the G-10 nations to form the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in late 1974, under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) located in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nBasel I, that is, the 1988 Basel Accord, is primarily focused on credit risk and appropriate risk-weighting of assets. Assets of banks were classified and grouped in five categories according to credit risk, carrying risk weights of 0% (for example cash, bullion, home country debt like Treasuries), 20% (securitisations such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) with the highest AAA rating), 50% (municipal revenue bonds, residential mortgages), 100% (for example, most corporate debt), and some assets given No rating. Banks with an international presence are required to hold capital equal to 8% of their risk-weighted assets (RWA). \n\nThe tier 1 capital ratio = tier 1 capital / all RWA\n\nThe total capital ratio = (tier 1 + tier 2 capital) / all RWA\n\nLeverage ratio = total capital/average total assets\n\nBanks are also required to report off-balance-sheet items such as letters of credit, unused commitments, and derivatives. These all factor into the risk weighted assets. The report is typically submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank as HC-R for the bank-holding company and submitted to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) as RC-R for just the bank.\n\nFrom 1988 this framework was progressively introduced in member countries of G-10, comprising 13 countries : Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States of America.\n\nOver 100 other countries also adopted, at least in name, the principles prescribed under Basel I. The efficacy with which the principles are enforced varies, even within nations of the Group.\n\n\n"}

The \"Star Press\" was first published on Tuesday, August 31, 1976 and covered Springboro, Hunter, and Clearcreek Township. The first editor was Stephanie Shutts-Irwin who was succeeded by Cathy nolte in 1979, and later by Jean Kowalski. In 1979, the paper expanded coverage to Franklin and Carlisle, directly competing with the Thomson Corporation's weekly \"Franklin Chronicle\", established in 1872. While the paper's office was in Springboro, the paper was produced at the offices of \"The Western Star\" in Lebanon. A Sunday edition, called the \"Sunday Star Press\", was established in the early 1990s in order to distribute advertising circulars.\n\nIn 1998, Brown traded the \"Star Press\" along with \"The Western Star\", \"Today's Express\" in Morrow, the \"Monroe Times\", and the \"Miamisburg-West Carrollton News\" to The Thomson Corporation, a Canadian newspaper company known for the poor quality of its publications, in exchange for three daily papers, the \"Piqua Daily Call\", the \"Xenia Gazette\", and the \"Greenville Daily Advocate\".

Compared to regular ice cream, it can be kept at room temperature without melting and is more brittle and rigid but still soft when bitten into. It was developed by Whirlpool Corporation under contract to NASA for the Apollo missions. However, it was never used on any Apollo mission. Freeze-dried foods were developed so that foods could be sent on long-duration spaceflights, as to the Moon, and to reduce the weight of the water and oxygen normally found in food.\n\nFreeze drying (or lyophilization) removes water from the ice cream by lowering the air pressure to a point where ice sublimates from a solid to a gas. The ice cream is placed in a vacuum chamber and frozen until the water crystallizes. The air pressure is lowered, creating a partial vacuum, forcing air out of the chamber; next heat is applied, sublimating the ice; finally a freezing coil traps the vaporized water. This process continues for hours, resulting in a freeze-dried ice cream slice.\n\nFreeze-dried ice cream is sold by mail order and is common in science museums and NASA visitor center gift shops, sometimes accompanied by other freeze-dried foods. They are also for sale in several physical camping stores like REI.\n\nDespite the common use of images of space walking astronauts in shuttle era space suits on packaging, freeze dried ice cream was not included on any Apollo, Skylab, Space Shuttle, or International Space Station missions. According to one NASA food scientist, although freeze-dried ice cream was developed on request, \"it wasn't that popular.\"\n\nDuring the 1970s, astronauts ate regular ice cream on the Skylab space station and regular ice cream has also been eaten on the International Space Station.\nSkylab had a freezer that was used for regular ice cream, and occasionally Space Shuttle and International Space Station astronauts have taken regular ice cream into space.\n\n\n"}

Formerly a French engineer working for NATO, Gerard had a falling out with his former employees, supposedly related to political decisions over implementing his research, based on the development of a weapon that generates high velocity tornado-like winds. Cyclone took his invention and used it for his own criminal ends, developing his costume and other weapons. Like many criminal masterminds in Spider-Man comics, he decided to form a gang and capture J. Jonah Jameson, the owner of the Daily Bugle, and like so many criminal masterminds who follow this plan, he was defeated by Spider-Man. He also kidnapped Joseph \"Robbie\" Robertson, but was again defeated by Spider-Man.\n\nHe was subsequently broken out of prison by the Masked Marauder and employed by the Nefaria Family of the Maggia as an enforcer. Cyclone was sent to kill Spider-Man and Moon Knight, but was defeated by Moon Knight. He was doing relatively well for himself, in spite of his defeats at the hands of Spider-Man. Concerned over the deaths of various costumed villains by the vigilante Scourge organization, Cyclone attended a meeting at the \"Bar with No Name\" in Medinah County, Ohio, to deal with the Scourge and was shot to death by a Scourge agent posing as the bartender.\n\nGerard's DNA was later used by Arnim Zola to create a proto-husk. This proto-husk attacked and was killed by Deadpool.\n\nAndré Gerard seemingly returned from the dead in the 2007-08 \"Captain Marvel\" mini-series, but it is revealed that this is really a Skrull impostor. It was killed by Captain Marvel (who was actually a Skrull sleeper agent) with its remains decimated in one powerful attack.\n\nCyclone was later among the eighteen victims of Scourge to be resurrected by Hood using the power of Dormammu as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the Punisher. After the Punisher is captured, he is present at the ritual where the Hood intends to resurrect the Punisher's family. The Hood gives the Punisher a knife to sacrifice G. W. Bridge, but the Punisher instead uses the knife to slash Cyclone's throat.\n\nThe second Cyclone appeared in \"Marvel Comics Presents\" #97/4 (December 1992). Gregory Stevens acquired the Cyclone costume. At the \"Bar with No Name,\" Cyclone participated in a bar fight initiated by the Impossible Man posing as the Ace of Spades in a poker game.\n\nHe later assisted various agents of Justin Hammer (consisting of Afterburner, Beetle, Blacklash, a substitute Blizzard, Boomerang and Spymaster) in attacking Silver Sable and her Wild Pack. Cyclone used his cyclone-producing gloves to throw rubble at Silver Sable's group. Cyclone and Beetle retreated when Larry Arnold started shooting at them.\n\nNever saying a word in all of his appearances, Stevens was reported killed in a skiing accident. \n\nPierre Fresson was a member of a European crime family who was given the recreated Cyclone suit. Not wishing to serve the European crime family any longer, he stole the suit and fled. Now freelance, he operated as an agent of Justin Hammer, before being recruited into Justine Hammer's first incarnation of the Masters of Evil. As a part of the Masters of Evil, Cyclone battled against the Thunderbolts and other assorted heroes. Fresson also represented the European families when Grim Reaper called a meeting of Maggia bosses.\n\nLater, he attempted to steal Justin Hammer's will, before being soundly defeated by the Thunderbolts again. After it was revealed that Justin Hammer had planted time bombs in his former agents, Cyclone was given the option to work with the Thunderbolts to rid themselves of the threat. At first, Fresson attempted to flee, but quickly surrendered and joined the Thunderbolts. Running into Silver Sable like his predecessor, Fresson would assist the Thunderbolts in freeing Justin Hammer's former agents of their biological time bomb. He was also with the Thunderbolts when they attacked the omnipotent Thanos after Thanos had received the power of the Heart of the Infinite. Cyclone would battle against the Elite Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. before Hawkeye would give him the option of either remaining a Thunderbolt or being cut loose. Choosing the latter, Cyclone was dropped with an electrical arrow and turned over to S.H.I.E.L.D. as he was no longer a Thunderbolt and therefore a felon.\n\nDuring the \"Civil War\" storyline, someone that looks like Cyclone popped up in Hammerhead's villain army when S.H.I.E.L.D. attacked their headquarters.\n\nBoomerang and Owl hire Cyclone onto the Sinister Sixteen, assembled to distract the Chameleon's forces while Boomerang steals from him. When the police arrived, Cyclone and most of the Sinister Sixteen surrendered.\n\nAfter being bailed out of jail, Cyclone, Man Mountain Marko, Shriek, and Kangaroo instigated a bar fight against Boomerang's group. After nearly taking out Beetle, Cyclone was tackled by Speed Demon who took Cyclone as far away as the New Jersey Turnpike South.\n\nAs part of the \"All-New, All-Different Marvel,\" Cyclone was causing havoc in Atlantic City with his artificial hurricane. He faced off against the Avengers and is defeated by Vision.\n\nDuring the \"Opening Salvo\" part of the \"Secret Empire\" storyline, Cyclone is recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join the Army of Evil.\n\nThe original Cyclone was a man with gifted intelligence, with a master's degree in mechanical engineering.\n\nHe designed a costume for himself which contained mechanisms that enabled him to accelerate volumes of air up to within a radius of from his body in the form of tornado-force whirlwinds about himself. He was able to use these whirlwinds to fly and could use them offensively against opponents. His costume was later passed on to the second Cyclone and later recreated for the third Cyclone.\n\nA member of the Elementals that is modeled after Cyclone appears in \"\". It was labeled as an Air Elemental with power over wind, though its preferred method of attack was the use of lightning strikes. Though defeated offscreen in Morocco, the Air Elemental, like the other Elementals, was actually drones using illusion technology that was utilized by Quentin Beck and his fellow ex-Stark Industries employees (it is, in fact, the first Elemental to be determined an illusion—courtesy of Michelle Jones—and is the last Elemental to be seen as such before the final Elemental fusion illusion in London).\n\n"}
{"id": "2246357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246357", "title": "Medang Kingdom", "text": "Medang Kingdom\n\nThe Medang Kingdom or Mataram Kingdom was a Javanese Hindu–Buddhist kingdom that flourished between the 8th and 11th centuries. It was based in Central Java, and later in East Java. Established by King Sanjaya, the kingdom was ruled by the Sailendra dynasty.\n\nDuring most of its history the kingdom seems have relied heavily on agriculture, especially extensive rice farming, and later also benefited from maritime trade. According to foreign sources and archaeological findings, the kingdom seems to have been well populated and quite prosperous. The kingdom developed a complex society, had a well developed culture, and achieved a degree of sophistication and refined civilization.\n\nIn the period between the late 8th century and the mid-9th century, the kingdom saw the blossoming of classical Javanese art and architecture reflected in the rapid growth of temple construction. Temples dotted the landscape of its heartland in Mataram (Kedu and Kewu Plain). The most notable of the temples constructed in Medang Mataram are Kalasan, Sewu, Borobudur and Prambanan, all quite close to present-day city of Yogyakarta. At its peak, the kingdom had become a dominant empire—not only in Java, but also in Sumatra, Bali, southern Thailand, Indianized kingdoms of the Philippines, and the Khmer in Cambodia.\n\nLater the dynasty divided into two kingdoms identified by religious patronage—the Buddhist and Shivaist dynasties. Civil war followed. The outcome was that the Medang empire was divided into two powerful kingdoms; the Shivaist dynasty of Medang kingdom in Java led by Rakai Pikatan and the Buddhist dynasty of Srivijaya kingdom in Sumatra led by Balaputradewa. Hostility between them did not end until 1006 when the Sailendra clan based in Srivijaya incited a rebellion by Wurawari, a vassal of the Medang kingdom, and sacked the capital of Watugaluh in East Java. Srivijaya rose to become the undisputed hegemonic empire in the region. The Shivaist dynasty survived, reclaimed east Java in 1019, and then established the Kahuripan kingdom led by Airlangga, son of Udayana of Bali.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the discovery of numerous ruins of great monuments—such as Borobudur, Sewu and Prambanan— which dominated the landscape of the Kedu and Kewu plains in Yogyakarta and Central Java, caught the attention of some historians and scholars in the colonial Dutch East Indies. This spurred archaeological studies to uncover the history of this ancient civilisation.\n\nThe history of the Mataram area as the capital of the Central Javanese Medang kingdom is also part of the historical \"Yawadvipa\" or \"Bhumijava\" (the land of Java), and the classical Javanese civilisation. The Indians collectively called them as \"Yawadvipa\", the Khmer refer to them as \"Chvea\", the Chinese called them as \"Shepo\", \"Chopo\" or \"Chao-wa\", the Arabs called them as \"Jawi\" or \"Jawah\", and Srivijayan refer to them as \"Bhumijava\". The native Javanese most often refer to their lands and country simply as \"Jawi\" (Java), while the name of their \"nagara\" (country) is often based on their capital. The only foreign source mentioning \"Mdaη\" was found from the Philippines inscription, dated 822 saka (900).\n\nThere are no comprehensive written records that have survived in Java except numbers of \"prasasti\" (inscriptions) written on stones or copper plates. These inscriptions most often recorded the political and religious deeds of the rulers. The most common theme mentioned in inscriptions is the establishment of \"Sima\" (taxed rice cultivation land recognised through royal edict), and sometimes some portion or the whole of tax collected from this \"Sima\" land is appointed to fund the construction and maintenance of religious building. Nevertheless, some local legends and historical records, written on \"lontar\"—most often dated from later period—might also provides data and source to reconstruct the historical event.\n\nNative Javanese mythology and beliefs composed in the Mataram Sultanate era (circa 17th century), but probably originating from an earlier period, mentioned a semi-mythological kingdom named Medang Kamulan, which in Javanese translates to \"Medang the origin\" kingdom. The kingdom is mentioned in the myth of Dewi Sri and also Aji Saka. This is probably the remnant of vague native Javanese collective memory of the existence of an ancient kingdom called \"Medang\".\n\nCurrent knowledge of historical Javanese civilisation is thus primarily derived from:\n\nInitially, the kingdom was identified only through its location Yawadvipa (Java island) as mentioned in Canggal inscription (732). The inscription mentioned \"Rakai Mataram Sang Ratu Sanjaya\" (King Sanjaya, the Rakai (lord) of Mataram). The earlier historians such as Soekmono, identify this kingdom as Mataram, a historic geographical name to identify the plain south of Mount Merapi in central Java, roughly corresponds to modern Muntilan (where the Canggal temple on Gunung Wukir hill is located), Yogyakarta, Sleman and Bantul Regency. This is based on the locations where large numbers of candi were discovered in and around Prambanan Plain. The etymology of the name \"Mataram\" derived from a Sanskrit term for \"mother\".\n\nThe name Medang appear later in East Javanese inscriptions such as Anjukladang inscription (937) and Minto Stone (982), Paradah inscription and some inscriptions discovered in Surabaya. As the result, historians tends to identify the Eastern Java period (929—1006) of this kingdom as \"Medang\" to differ it with its earlier Central Java period of \"Mataram\" (732—929). However, by examining the phrase in Anjukladang inscription mentioning: \"\"Kita prasiddha mangrakpa kadatwan rahyang ta i Mdaŋ i Bhûmi Matarâm\"\" suggests that the name \"Mdaŋ\" (read: Mdang or Medang) was already used earlier in Central Java period. The phrase \"\"Mdaŋ i Bhûmi Matarâm\"\" literally means \"Medang in the land of Mataram\", which means the kingdom name is Medang with its capital in Mataram. The etymology of the name \"Medang\" might be derived from a local name of the hardwood \"medang\" tree which refer to trees of the genus \"Phoebe\". However, another etymological approach suggests that it might derived from old Javanese term \"medang\" which means \"gracefully appear\". It might be related to a Javanese term \"medal\" which means \"going out\", and Sundanese term \"midang\" which refer to dress up and appear gracefully in public.\nThe court moved several times after Mataram (reign of Sanjaya) to Mamrati or Amrati (reign of Rakai Pikatan), Poh Pitu (reign of Balitung), again to Bhumi Mataram (reign of Dyah Wawa), Tamwlang (reign of Sindok), Watugaluh (reign of Sindok), and last to Wwatan (reign of Dharmawangsa Teguh).\n\nThe name \"Mataram\" reappeared again later in the 14th century as one of Majapahit's province. Later in the 16th century appeared the Islamic Mataram Sultanate located in the same area in Yogyakarta vicinity. As the result, earlier historian also named this kingdom as Hindu Mataram or Ancient Mataram to differ it with later Islamic Mataram Sultanate.\n\nThis historic Javanese Kingdom of Mataram should not be confused with the Mataram city located on Lombok island, currently the capital of West Nusa Tenggara province. The latter was actually the royal capital of the Cakranegara, a branch of Balinese Karangasem nobles that colonize Lombok in early 19th century. Indeed, Lombok's Mataram city was named after the historic region of Mataram in Java, as it is a common practice for Balinese to name their settlements after their Javanese Majapahit heritage.\n\nThe earliest account of the Medang Mataram Kingdom is in the Canggal inscription, dated 732, discovered within the compound of Gunung Wukir temple in Canggal village, southwest of the town of Magelang. This inscription, written in Sanskrit using the Pallava script, tells of the erection of a \"lingga\" (a symbol of Shiva) on the hill in the Kunjarakunja area, located on a noble island called Yawadwipa (Java) which was blessed with abundance of rice and gold. The establishment of lingga was under the order of Rakai Mataram Sang Ratu Sanjaya (King Sanjaya Rakai (lord) of Mataram). This inscription tells that Yawadwipa was ruled by King Sanna, whose long reign was marked by wisdom and virtue. After Sanna died, the kingdom fell into disunity. Sanjaya, the son of Sannaha (Sanna's sister) ascended to the throne. He conquered the areas around his kingdom, and his wise reign blessed his land with peace and prosperity for all of his subjects.\n\nIt seemed that Sanjaya came to power c. 717 CE, that was the starting year of Sanjaya chronicle used in King Daksa's inscription far later in early 10th-century. According to Canggal inscription, Sanjaya established a new kingdom in Southern Central Java. And yet it seems to be the continuation of earlier polity ruled by King Sanna, Sanjaya's uncle. This earlier polity is linked to the earlier temple structures in Dieng Plateau, in the northern part of Central Java, which is the oldest surviving structure found in Central Java. The earlier kingdom linked as the predecessor of Medang kingdom is Kalingga, located somewhere in Central Java northern coast.\n\nThe story of Sanna and Sanjaya are also described in the \"Carita Parahyangan\", a book from a later period composed around late 16th-century, which mainly describes the history of Pasundan (the Sunda Kingdom). However, in this book, Sanjaya is described as Sanna's son, rather than his nephew. It also mentions that Sanna was defeated by Purbasora, King of Galuh, and retreated to Mount Merapi. So, to avenge the defeat of his father, Sanjaya attacked Galuh and killed Purbasora and his family. Afterwards, Sanjaya reclaimed Sanna's kingdom and ruled West Java, Central Java, East Java, and Bali. He also battled the Malayu and Keling (against their king, Sang Srivijaya). Although the manuscript seems to be romanticised, vague and not providing certain details on the period, nevertheless the almost exact name and theme of the story with historical Canggal inscription seems to confirm that the manuscript was based or inspired from the historical event.\n\nThe period between the reign of King Panangkaran to King Balitung (span between 760—910) that roughly lasted for 150 years, marked the apogee of Javanese classic civilisation. This period witnessed the blossoming of Javanese art and architecture, as numbers of majestic temples and monuments were erected and dominated the skyline of Kedu and Kewu Plain. Most notable of these temples are Sewu, Borobudur and Prambanan temple. The Sailendras are known as the ardent temple builder.\n\nKing Sanjaya was a Shivaist, and yet his successor Panangkaran was a Mahayana Buddhist. This shift of faith, from Shivaist Sanjaya to Buddhist Panangkaran has raised problematic questions among scholars; whether there were two competing royal families that dominated the political landscapes in Central Java, that each are patrons of either Shivaist Hindu or Mahayana Buddhism. Or more recently suggested theory, that there were only one dynasty—the Sailendras—and there was only the shift or split of royal patronage in favour to Hinduism or Buddhism.\n\nPanangkaran (r. 760—780) was an enthusiastic developer, he was credited for at least five major temple projects conducted and started during his reign. According to the Kalasan inscription, dated 778 and written in the Pranagari script in Sanskrit, the Kalasan temple was erected by the will of \"Guru Sang Raja Sailendravamçatilaka\" (the teacher of the ornament of Sailendra family), who persuaded Panangkaran (Sanjaya's successor) to construct a holy building for the goddess (\"boddhisattvadevi\") Tara and build a vihara (monastery) for Buddhist monks from the Sailendra realm. Panangkaran also awarded Kalaça village to a \"sangha\" (Buddhist monastic community). The temple connected to this inscription is the Kalasan temple that housed the image of Tara, and the nearby Sari temple that was probably functioned as the monastery.\n\nPanangkaran was also responsible for the construction of Abhayagiri Vihara, connected to the today site of Ratu Boko. This hilltop compound was actually not a religious structure; consist of series of gates, ramparts, fortified walls, dry moats, walled enclosure, terraces and building bases. This site displays attributes of an occupation or settlement site, although its precise functions is unknown. This led to a suggestion that this compound probably was served as the palace. Initially probably it was intended as a secluded hilltop Buddhist monastery, as mentioned in the Abhayagiri Vihara inscription. However, later it seems to be converted to become a fortified palace or a citadel, which evidence in the remnant of defensive structures.\nKing Panangkaran probably also responsible to the conception and laid the foundation for the construction of grand Manjusrigrha temple, as mentioned in Manjusrigrha inscription dated 792. The king however, never saw the completion of this grand temple complex, as it finished in 792, long after his death probably around 780. This massive temple complex with total of 249 structures was the grandest of its time, and probably served as the official state's temple that conducted important stately religious ceremonies.\n\nThere are some reports that naval Javanese raiders invaded Tran-nam in 767, Champa in 774, and Champa again in 787. The successor of Panangkaran was Dharanindra (r. 780—800) or commonly known as King Indra. He was mentioned in Kelurak inscription (dated 782) in his formal reign name Sri Sanggrama Dhananjaya. In this inscription he was hailed as \"Wairiwarawiramardana\" or \"the slayer of courageous enemies\". The similar title also found in Ligor B inscription discovered in Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula; \"Sarwwarimadawimathana\", which suggest it referred to the same person. Dharanindra seems to be a valiant and warlike character, as he embarked on military naval expedition overseas and has brought Sailendras' control on Ligor in Malay Peninsula.\n\nKing Indra seems to continue the builder tradition of his predecessor. He continued the construction of Manjusrigrha temple (Sewu complex), and according to the Karangtengah inscription (dated 824) responsible for the construction of Venuvana temple, connected to Mendut or probably Ngawen temple. He was also probably responsible for the conception and initiation of the construction of Borobudur and Pawon temple.\n\nDharanindra ascends as the Maharaja of Srivijaya. The nature of Sailendras' close relations with the neighbouring Srivijayan empire based on Sumatra is quite uncertain and complicated. It seems that in earlier times, Sailendra family belonged within Srivijayan mandala sphere of influence. And for later period of time Sailendras' monarch rose to become the head of Srivijayan mandala. The shift that rendered Sailendras in return to become the ruler of Srivijaya was unclear. Was it led by military campaign by Dharanindra against Srivijaya in Sumatra, or more likely formed by close alliance and kinship between the house of Sailendra and the Maharaja of Srivijaya.\n\nBased on the Ligor inscription, Laguna copperplate inscription and Pucangan inscription, the influence and knowledge of the Medang Kingdom reached as far as Bali, southern Thailand, the Indianized kingdoms in the Philippines, and the Khmer in Cambodia.\n\nDharanindra's successor was Samaragrawira (r. 800—819), mentioned in Nalanda inscription (dated 860) as the father of Balaputradewa, and the son of \"Śailendravamsatilaka\" (the ornament of Śailendra family) with stylised name \"Śrīviravairimathana\" (the slayer of enemy hero), which refer to Dharanindra. Unlike his predecessor the expansive warlike Dharanindra, Samaragrawira seems to be a pacifist, enjoying a peaceful prosperity of interior Java in Kedu Plain, and more interested on completing the Borobudur project. He appointed the Khmer prince Jayavarman as the governor of Indrapura in the Mekong delta under Sailendran rule. This decision was proven as a mistake, as Jayavarman later revolted, moved his capital further inland north from Tonle Sap to Mahendraparvata, severed the link and proclaimed Cambodian independence from Java in 802. Samaragrawira was mentioned as the king of Java that married Tārā, daughter of Dharmasetu. He was mentioned as his other name Rakai Warak in Mantyasih inscription.\n\nEarlier historians, such as N. J. Krom, and Coedes, tend to equate Samaragrawira and Samaratungga as the same person. However, later historians such as Slamet Muljana equate Samaratungga with Rakai Garung, mentioned in Mantyasih inscription as the fifth monarch of Mataram kingdom. Which means Samaratungga was the successor of Samaragrawira.\n\nSamaratungga (r. 819–838) was credited for the completion of massive stone mandala, the grand monument of Borobudur (completed in 825). Samaratungga just like Samaragrawira, seems to be deeply influenced by peaceful Mahayana Buddhist beliefs and strive to become a pacifist and a benevolent ruler. His successor was Princess Pramodhawardhani that betrothed to Shivaite Rakai Pikatan, son of the influential Rakai Patapan, a landlord in Central Java. The political move that seems as an effort to secure peace and Sailendran rule on Java by reconciling the Mahayana Buddhist with Shivaist Hindus.\n\nThe rule of Shivaist Rakai Pikatan (r. 838–850) and his Buddhist queen consort Pramodhawardhani marked the return of the Medang Mataram court favour to Shivaist Hindu, instead of Mahayana Buddhism favoured by previous king Samaratungga. This is evident in the construction of grand Shivagrha temple compound in the Mataram capital, located only few hundred meters south from Manjusrigrha temple compound. Nevertheless, the inter-religious relations during Pikatan's reign seems to promote tolerance in the spirit of reconciliation. Their reign is credited to the construction and expansion of at least two of perwara temple and stupa in Plaosan complex, located east from Sewu (Manjusrigrha) temple. Plaosan temple with twin main temples is probably built and dated from an earlier period, probably started by Panangkaran, Samaragrawira or Samaratungga, but completed during Pikatan-Pramodhawardhani's reign.\n\nBalaputra however, opposed the rule of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani. The relations between Balaputra and Pramodhawardhani is interpreted differently by some historians. Older theory according to Bosch and De Casparis holds that Balaputra was the son of Samaratungga, which means he was the younger brother of Pramodhawardhani. Later historians such as Muljana on the other hand, argued that Balaputra was the son of Samaragrawira and the younger brother of Samaratungga, which means he was the uncle of Pramodhawardhani.\n\nIt is not known whether Balaputra was expelled from Central Java because of succession dispute with Pikatan, or was he already ruled in Suvarnadvipa (Sumatra). Either ways, it seems that Balaputra eventually ruled the Sumatran branch of Sailendra dynasty and enthroned in Srivijayan capital of Palembang. Historians argued that this was because Balaputra's mother—Tara, the queen consort of King Samaragrawira was the princess of Srivijaya, this rendered Balaputra as the heir of Srivijayan throne. Balaputra the Maharaja of Srivijaya later stated his claim as the rightful heir of Sailendra dynasty from Java, as proclaimed in Nalanda inscription dated 860.\n\nThe Shivagrha inscription (dated 856) mentioned about a war challenging Pikatan's reign, the inscription however did not mention who was the enemy that challenged Pikatan's authority. The earlier historians suggests that it was Balaputradewa that rose against Pikatan, however later historians suggest it was another enemy, argued by that time Balaputra already ruled in Srivijaya. The Shivagrha inscription only mentioned that the battle happened in a fortress on a hill protected by bulk of stone walls, this fortress hill is identified with Ratu Boko archaeological site. The eldest children of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani was Rakai Gurunwangi Dyah Saladu. Eventually the revolt was successfully defeated by Pikatan's youngest son—the valiant Dyah Lokapala also known as Rakai Kayuwangi. As the reward for his heroic deed and bravery, the people and many of Pikatan's state advisors urged that Lokapala should be named as crown prince instead of Gurunwangi. Gurunwangi's loss of favour in succession—despite being the eldest sibling, has raised a question among scholars. It was previously thought that the name Rakai Gurunwangi Dyah Saladu refer to a female character (princess), although it is more likely that Gurunwangi was a prince.\n\nThis revolt seems to have succeeded in taking over the capital in Mataram for a certain period. After defeating the usurper, Pikatan found that this bloodshed has made the capital in Mataram inauspicious, thus he moved the karaton (court) to Mamrati or Amrati located somewhere in Kedu Plain (Progo river valley), northwest from Mataram.\n\nLater Pikatan decided to abdicate his throne in favour of his youngest son Dyah Lokapala (r. 850—890). Rakai Pikatan retired, renounce worldly affairs and become a hermit named Sang Prabhu Jatiningrat. The event also marked with the consecrated ceremony of Shiva image in Prambanan main temple. Boechari suggests that the enemy that challenged Pikatan was Rakai Walaing pu Kumbhayoni, a powerful Shivaist landlord and also the branch of the ruling dynasty as he claimed as the descendant of a king that ruled Java.\n\nThe Medang Mataram kings after Pikatan; from Lokapala, Watuhumalang (r. 890—898) and Balitung are the patrons of Shivaist Hindu, \"after the decline of the power of the Buddhist Sailendras in central Java.\" Their reign seems to enjoyed a relative peace. The grand Shivagrha temple compound are continuously expanded and completed with hundreds of perwara (complementary) temples surrounding the main three prasada (tower) of Trimurti Hindu Gods. It is probably during their reign that some Hindu temples are constructed in the area, such as Sambisari, Barong, Ijo, Kedulan, Kimpulan, Kadisoka, Gebang and Merak temple. Barong and Ijo temples in particular are interesting, for they are built on the hill and has different layout compared to earlier temples. Sewu and Prambanan temples are arranged in concentric mandala layout. Barong and Ijo temples however, are arranged in completely different way; the main temple is located in further back of the compound on the most higher ground, while the perwara complementary temples are built in front of the main temple on the lower ground, the layout corresponds to the uneven topography of the site. This style of temple layout is most likely the predecessor and will be continued in the later East Javanese temple architecture.\n\nKing Pikatan, Lokapala (Rakai Kayuwangi), and Watuhumalang ruled from their court in Mamrati or Amrati, they are known as \"Amrati Kings\". The exact location of Mamrati is unknown, suggested somewhere in Kedu Plain (modern day Magelang and Temanggung regencies), located north from Mataram along Progo River valley. It was suggested that Amrati might be located near the location of Wanua Tengah III inscription, in Kedunglo hamlet, Kaloran village, within Temanggung Regency.\nAfter absent for several generations, the name \"Mataram\" reappears in Javanese inscription during the reign of Balitung, which probably signify the transfer of capital. King Balitung moved his capital from Amrati to Poh Pitu, and renamed Poh Pitu as Yawapura. Again the exact location of this capital is unknown, probably also located within Kedu Plain. However, it is highly possible that Poh Pitu was located around the Poh inscription (905), in Dumpoh hamlet, Potrobangsan village, North Magelang district within Magelang city. Balitung productively issued several inscriptions, among others are Telahap inscription (dated 11 September 899), Watukura inscription (27 July 902), Telang (11 January 904), Poh (17 July 905), Kubu-Kubu (17 October 905), Mantyasih (11 April 907), and Rukam (907).\n\nOur current knowledge of the names of kings that reign the Medang Mataram kingdom is much owed to Mantyasih inscription (dated 907), issued by King Balitung (r. 898—910)—that contains genealogy and the reign order of Medang Mataram kings, and he seek ancestor as far as King Sanjaya. This inscription is also known as \"Balitung charter\". The motivation of Balitung's edict has sparked various assumptions from historians—as if Balitung eagerly seeks legitimacy of his rule, by stating his ancestral lineage. It is highly possible that he related to the royal family and shared common ancestry. Thus, suggested that he married to the daughter of previous king, which made him the royal son in-law as well as heir.\nThe Watukura inscription (902) is the oldest inscription in Javanese statecraft that mentioned the position of Rakryan Kanuruhan (Prime Minister), while the position of Rakryan Mapatih—which in Balitung's era is equivalent to crown prince, was held by Mpu Daksa. The relation between Balitung and his successor Daksha is quite problematic, as historians suggested Daksha was the son of previous king (Watuhumalang), while the court was held by Balitung who is probably Dakhsa's brother in-law. The Telang inscription, dated 11 January 904, revealed the development of the port complex of Paparahuan which was led by Rakai Welar Mpu Sudarsana, located on the bank of Bengawan Solo river. By building port and ferry crossing in navigable Bengawan Solo, might signify the growing interest in maritime trade, thus the court interest has shifted eastward.\n\nThe Kubu-Kubu inscription (17 October 905) revealed the village Kubu-kubu was awarded to Rakryan Hujung Dyah Mangarak and Rakryan Matuha Dyah Majawuntan in recognition of their valor on conquering Bantan. The toponym of Bantan is unclear, it might be corresponds to the 10th century site of Banten Girang in present-day Banten province of western Java, or might be other place. While other historians speculated that Bantan might be an alternative name to Bali. In old Javanese, the term Bantan means \"sacrifice\" which often used interchangeably with Bali that means \"offering\".\n\nThe Mantyasih inscription (11 April 907) revealed the gifts awarded to five junior \"patihs\" (officials) for their service on maintained peace during Balitung's wedding. Also in 907, in Rukam inscription, Balitung offers that the Sima taxes being collected from the village of Rukam to be allocated for the construction and maintenance of a temple dedicated to his grandmother, Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana. The temple mentioned here is Sajiwan Buddhist temple, located not far south from Prambanan, probably was built during the end of Rakai Kayuwangi (King Lokapala) reign and completed in Balitung's reign. The temple is dedicated to Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana, linked to Sri Kahulunnan, another name of queen Pramodhawardhani. This temple probably was a mortuary temple dedicated as \"pedharmaan\" (dedication) for the deceased queen mother.\n\nThe rivalry between Balitung and Daksha was probably a result of the previous contest of succession between Rakai Gurunwangi and Rakai Kayuwangi (King Lokapala)—both are descendants of Rakai Pikatan. During the rule of his brother-in-law—Balitung, Mpu Daksa held the position as Rakai Hino, according to Taji Gunung inscription (dated 21 December 910), that mentioned about the partition of Taji Gunung area between him and Rakai Gurunwangi. It seems that Rakai Gurunwangi allied himself with his nephew Daksha. Historian Boechari is certain that the reign of Balitung was ended as the result of Mpu Daksha's rebellion. According to Taji Gunung inscription (910) Daksha was still as Rakai Hino, while in the stele of Timbangan Wungkal (913) he already ascended to the throne as the king. Although the kingdom also enjoyed relative peace and prosperity, after King Balitung, it seems that the construction of grand temples are decreased in both quality and quantity.\n\nDaksha ruled over the centre and the east portions of Java. King Daksha (r. 910—919) and his successor King Tulodong (r. 919—924) also ruled from Poh Pitu. The next monarch, King Wawa (r. 924—929) returned the capital back from Poh Pitu to Mataram. The Sanggurah inscription (dated 2 August 928)—found in Malang area in East Java is particularly interesting, since it mentioned about the deed of Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga (King Wawa) that granted the Sima status to the land in and around the source of Brantas river in present-day Batu and Malang area. This means that during the reign of Wawa, the kingdom has expanded eastward by establishing settlements (Sima lands) along the river Bengawan Solo and Brantas.\n\nAround the year 929, the centre of the kingdom was shifted from Central Java to East Java by Mpu Sindok, who established the Isyana Dynasty. The exact cause of the move is still uncertain. Historians have proposed various possible causes; from natural disaster, epidemic outbreak, politics and power struggle, to religious or economic motives.\n\nAccording to van Bemmelen's theory, which was supported by Prof. Boechari a severe eruption of Mount Merapi volcano probably has caused the move. Historians suggest that, some time during the reign of King Wawa of Mataram (924—929), Merapi volcano erupted and devastated the kingdom's capital in Mataram. The historic massive volcano eruption is popularly known as \"Pralaya Mataram\" (the debacle of Mataram). The evidence for this eruption can be seen in several temples that were virtually buried under Merapi's lahar and volcanic debris, such as the Sambisari, Morangan, Kedulan, Kadisoka and Kimpulan temples.\nArcheologist Agus Aris Munandar proposed a hypothesis, that the move was caused by a religious motives. He mentions that the incessant eruptions of Mount Merapi has caused the kingdom to move. Pointing out that in ancient Javanese beliefs, Merapi was considered as the Mahameru for the people in the ancient Mataram. According to Hindu teachings, the Mahameru peak symbolises the centre of the universe, the sacred realm where the gods live. Since their Mahameru in Central Java continued to erupt, they decided to move, but they still looked for another Mahameru. As East Java was still part of Mataram territory, it is possible that some of the people informed the Central Java kingdom that there was another Mahameru in the east. He suggests that the new sacred mountain was Mount Penanggungan in East Java, which resembles Mahameru.\n\nAnother hypothesis proposed by N.J. Krom says that the demise was caused by an epidemic break-out, forcing people to seek a new place to live. On the other hand, B. Schrieke says the move was caused by economic reasons; the vigorous temple construction boom during the era of Sailendran kings has put a tremendous economic burden upon the peasant. People were suffering as they were forced to build grand temples by the kings, instead of working their farms. Slowly they moved to the east to avoid the kings' orders.\nA power struggle is also proposed as the cause of the move. Coedes suggested that the move to East Java was probably in response to the Buddhist Sailendras. This theory is inline with the one proposed by J.G. de Casparis which suggests, that the shift of capital city eastward was to avoid a Srivijaya invasion from Sumatra.\n\nHowever, it was most likely motivated by economic reasons. De Casparis then expands his theory, saying that the location of the kingdom in Central Java was less accessible than East Java. The Brantas river valley was considered to be a strategic location, as the river provides easy access to reach ports on East Java's north coast and Java Sea, strategic for the control of maritime trade routes to the eastern parts of archipelago, being especially vital for control of the Maluku spice trade. This is in contrast with Mataram's Kedu and Kewu Plain that relatively isolated from the north coast of Central Java. Despite its fertility, ideal for rice agricultural kingdom, the Mataram Plain is quite isolated, its northern borders are protected by natural barrier of Merapi, Merbabu, Sumbing, Sundoro, Dieng and Ungaran volcanoes. Ideal for inward-looking agricultural polity, but insufficient to develop a maritime trading kingdom.\n\nThe recent studies suggest, that the move eastward was not an abrupt event. During the Mataram period in Central Java, the kingdom most likely already expanded eastward and established settlements along Brantas river in East Java. It was more likely that the move was done in gradual manner over long period. The cause of the move was also motivated from multiple factors; either natural, economy or politics. The Sanggurah inscription or popularly known as the \"Minto Stone\", dated to 982 — found in Malang, East Java in early 19th century — mentions the name of a Javanese king, Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga (King Wawa Wijayaloka), who then ruled the Malang area. This suggests that even during the reign of King Wawa, the Malang region in East Java already belongs within the realm of Medang Kingdom. The inscription contains elements about the shift of power that consequently took place to East Java.\n\nWhatever the true reasons behind the move of political centre from Central to East Java, this event marked the end of an era profoundly. Indeed, the temple-building activity has decreased since the era of King Balitung in scale, quality and quantity, and yet the Eastern Java period of Medang kingdom leave no tangible traces of any temple structure comparable to those of the previous Central Javanese Sailendra era. It seems that the kingdom no longer has the intention and the resource to embark on a grand scale construction project.\n\nAccording to Turyan inscription (dated 929), Sindok moved the capital to Tamwlang and later moved it again to Watugaluh. Historian identify those names with the Tambelang and Megaluh area near modern Jombang, East Java. Although Sindok establishes a new dynasty, the Isyana dynasty named after his daughter, Sindok seems to be closely related to the royal house of Medang Mataram, thus he can be viewed as the continuation of a long line of Javanese Kings lineage stretched from King Sanjaya. During his reign Sindok created quite a number of inscriptions, most are related to the establishment of \"Sima\" lands; these inscriptions are among others; Linggasutan (929), Gulung-Gulung (929), Cunggrang (929), Jru-Jru (930), Waharu (931), Sumbut (931), Wulig (935), and Anjukladang (937). Most of these inscription mentioned about the establishment of \"Sima\" or \"Swatantra\" lands. This signify that Sindok seems to consolidated his authority over East Java as collections of villages are declared as \"Sima\" lands, which means the settlements have developed wet rice cultivation and can be taxed and swore allegiance as part of Sindok's kingdom.\n\nThe Anjukladang inscription dated from 937 in particular is interesting, because it stated the \"Sima\" status is awarded to Anjukladang village and a temple is erected in recognition of their service on repelling the invading forces from Malayu. The temple mentioned here is probably the Candi Lor made of bricks which is now in ruins, located in Candirejo village in Nganjuk Regency. The mentioning of invading \"Malayu\" forces refer to the old name of Sumatran Malayu Kingdom, which probably means Srivijaya instead. This means the relations between East Javanese Medang kingdom with Srivijaya has badly deteriorated to the state of hostility.\n\nSindok was succeeded by his daughter Isyana Tunggawijaya. According to Gedangan inscription (dated 950), Queen Isyana married to Sri Lokapala, a nobleman from Bali. She later succeeded by her son Makutawangsa Wardhana c. 985. According to Pucangan inscription (dated 1041), King Makutawangsa Wardhana has a daughter named Mahendradatta, Makutawangsa Wardhana was replaced by his son Dharmawangsa Tguh c. 990s.\n\nA later king, Dharmawangsa, moved the capital again to Wwatan, identified as the Wotan area near modern Madiun. Dharmawangsa's sister, Mahendradatta later would be betrothed to a Balinese king Udayana Warmadewa. This report indicated that somehow Bali had been absorbed into the Medang Kingdom's mandala sphere of influence, probably as vassal. In literature development, King Dharmawangsa also ordered the translation of the \"Mahabharata\" into Old Javanese in 996.\n\nIn the late 10th century, the rivalry between the Sumatran Srivijaya and Javanese Mataram became more hostile. The animosity was probably caused by the Srivijayan effort to reclaim Sailendra lands in Java, as Balaputra and his offspring — a new dynasty of Srivijaya maharajas — belonged to the Sailendra dynasty, or by Medang aspirations to challenge Srivijaya dominance as the regional power. Previously the Anjukladang inscription dated from 937 mentioned about infiltration attack from Malayu which refer to a Srivijayan attack.\n\nIn 990, Dharmawangsa launched a naval invasion against Srivijaya in an attempt to capture Palembang. The news of Javanese invasion of Srivijaya was recorded in Chinese accounts from Song period. In 988, an envoy from \"San-fo-qi\" (Srivijaya) was sent to Chinese court in Guangzhou. After sojourned for about two years in China, the envoy learned that his country has been attacked by \"She-po\" (Java) thus made him unable to return home. In 992 the envoy from \"She-po\" (Java) arrived in Chinese court and explaining that their country has involved in continuous war with Srivijaya. In 999 the Srivijayan envoy sailed from China to Champa in an attempt to return home, however he received no news about the condition of his country. The Srivijayan envoy then sailed back to China and appealed Chinese Emperor for the protection of China against Javanese invaders.\n\nDharmawangsa's invasion led the Maharaja of Srivijaya, Sri Cudamani Warmadewa to seek protection from China. Srivijayan Maharaja, Sri Cudamani Warmadewa was an able and astute ruler, with shrewd diplomatic skills. In the midst of crisis brought by Javanese invasion, he secured Chinese political support by appeasing the Chinese Emperor. In 1003, a Song historical record reported that the envoy of \"San-fo-qi\" dispatched by the king Sri Cudamani Warmadewa, informed that a Buddhist temple had been erected in their country to pray for the long life of Chinese Emperor, thus asked the emperor to give the name and the bell for this temple which was built in his honor. Rejoiced, the Chinese Emperor named the temple \"Ch'eng-t'en-wan-shou\" ('ten thousand years of receiving blessing from heaven, which is China) and a bell was immediately cast and sent to Srivijaya to be installed in the temple.\n\nAfter 16 years of war, in 1006, Srivijaya managed to repelled the Medang invaders and liberated Palembang. This attack opened the eyes of the Srivijayan Maharaja to how dangerous the Medang kingdom could be, and he planned to destroy his new Javanese nemesis.\n\nIn retaliation, in 1016-1017, Srivijaya forces assisted Haji (king) Wurawari to revolt. He launched an invasion from Lwaram, attacked and destroyed the Medang Palace, killing Dharmawangsa and most of the royal family. Wurawari was a vassal polity located in present-day Banyumas area, south of Karang Kobar. Lwaram is connected to the modern day Ngloram village in Cepu region, Blora, Central Java. This sudden and unexpected attack took place during the wedding ceremony of Dharmawangsa's daughter, which rendered the court unprepared and shocked.\n\nThis calamity was recorded in Javanese account as the \"pralaya\" (the debacle) the death of the Mataram kingdom. With the death of Dharmawangsa and the fall of the capital, under military pressure from Srivijaya, the kingdom finally collapsed and fell to chaos. With the absence of Medang paramount ruler, warlords in regional provinces and settlements in central and east Java rebelled and break loose from the central Medang government and forming their own polities serving local dynasties. Raids and robbery were rampant ravaging the country. There was further unrest and violence several years after the kingdom's demise.\n\nAirlangga, a son of King Udayana Warmadewa of Bali and Queen Mahendradatta, also a nephew of slain King Dharmawangsa, managed to escape the destruction and went into exile in Vanagiri forest in interior Central Java. He later rallied popular support, reunited the remnants of the Medang Kingdom and re-established the kingdom (including Bali) under the name of Kingdom of Kahuripan in 1019. The Kingdom of Kahuripan can be considered as the successor state of Medang, and from this point on, the kingdom was known as Kahuripan, with its capital located near Brantas river estuarine, somewhere around modern Surabaya, Sidoarjo or Pasuruan in East Java.\n\nBosch in his book \"\"Srivijaya, de Sailendravamsa en de Sanjayavamsa\"\" (1952) suggested that king Sanjaya was the progenitor of the Sanjaya Dynasty, and there was two dynasties that ruled Central Java; the Buddhist Sailendra and the Shivaist Sanjaya dynasty. The inscription also states that Sanjaya was an ardent follower of Shaivism. From its founding in the early 8th century until 928, the kingdom was ruled by the Sanjaya dynasty. The first king was Sanjaya, who ruled in the Mataram region in the vicinity of modern Yogyakarta and Prambanan, and left the written records on the Canggal inscription. However, around the mid 8th century, the Sailendra dynasty emerged in Central Java and challenged Sanjaya domination in the region.\n\nThe prevailing historical interpretation holds that the Sailendra dynasty co-existed next to the Sanjaya dynasty in Central Java, and much of the period was characterised by peaceful co-operation. The Sailendra, with their strong connections to Srivijaya, managed to gain control of Central Java and become overlords of the \"Rakai\" (local Javanese lords), including the Sanjayas, thus making the Sanjaya kings of Mataram their vassals. Little is known about the kingdom due to the dominance of the Sailendra, who during this period constructed Borobudur, a Buddhist monument. Samaratungga, the monarch of the Sailendra, tried to secure the Sailendra position in Java, cementing an alliance with the Sanjayas by arranging the marriage of his daughter Pramodhawardhani with Pikatan.\n\nAround the middle of the 9th century, relations between the Sanjaya and the Sailendra deteriorated. In 852, the Sanjaya ruler, Pikatan, defeated Balaputra, the offspring of the Sailendra monarch Samaratunga and the princess Tara. This ended the Sailendra presence in Java; Balaputra retreated to the Srivijayan capital in Sumatra, where he became the paramount ruler. The victory of Pikatan was recorded in Shivagrha inscription dated 856, created by Rakai Kayuwangi, Pikatan's successor.\n\nHowever, this dual Sailendra—Sanjaya dynasties theory proposed by Bosch and De Casparis was opposed by some Indonesian historians in later period. An alternate theory, proposed by Poerbatjaraka, suggests there was only one kingdom and one dynasty, the kingdom called Medang, with the capital in the Mataram area (thus the name of the kingdom: \"\"Medang i Bhumi Mataram\"\"), and the ruling dynasty being the Sailendra.\n\nThis theory is supported with Boechari interpretation on Sojomerto inscription and Poerbatjaraka study on Carita Parahyangan manuscript, Poerbatjaraka holds that Sanjaya and all of his offspring belongs to the Sailendra family, which initially was Shivaist Hindu. However, according to Raja Sankhara inscription (now missing); Sanjaya's son, Panangkaran, converted to Mahāyāna Buddhism. And because of that conversion, the later series of Sailendra kings who ruled Medang become Mahāyāna Buddhists also and gave Buddhism royal patronage in Java until the end of Samaratungga's reign. The Shivaist Hindus regained royal patronage with the reign of Pikatan, which lasted until the end of the Medang Kingdom. During the reign of Kings Pikatan and Balitung, the royal Hindu Trimurti temple of Prambanan was built and expanded in the vicinity of Yogyakarta.\n\nThe complex stratified ancient Javan society, with its refined aesthetic taste in art and culture, is evidenced through the various scenes in narrative bas-reliefs carved on various temples dated from the Medang era.\n\nDuring this period the common concept of city, as it known in Europe, Middle East or China, as the urban concentration centre of politics, administration, religious and economic activities, was not quite established yet in ancient Java. The proper urban development as a city took place later in 13th century Majapahit's Trowulan.\n\nThe capital itself is more likely refer to the palace, a walled compound called \"pura\" in Sanskrit, or in local Javanese as \"karaton\" or \"kadatwan\", this is where the king and his family reside and rule his court. The palace itself is more of a collection of \"pendopo\" style pavilions surrounded by walls. These pavilions and halls are made from organic wooden and thatched materials, so they had decayed over centuries leaving only stone walls, gates, terraces and bases. The example of this type of secular buildings can be found in Ratu Boko compound. The Javanese urban centre in this period did not recognise walled-city as it found in Chinese or Indian counterparts, the only walled, well-guarded and protected compound was the king's palace and temple compound. The \"nagara\" or capital itself was more of a collection of densely populated villages surrounding the \"pura\" (king's palace).\n\nThe religious activity centres, which refer to the location of where the temples stood, did not necessarily signify the administrative or economic centre as well. As according to inscriptions, numbers of lands has been awarded a \"Sima\" status with portion or the whole of its rice tax revenue was allocated to funding the construction and maintaining the temple. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that the Prambanan Plain with high concentration of temples located just few hundred meters away from each other — Sambisari, Kalasan, Sari, Sewu, Lumbung, Prambanan, Plaosan, Sajiwan, Banyunibo, Ratuboko, Barong and Ijo temples — was might be the location of the capital of Mataram. Other expert argued that the Prambanan area was indeed the religious centre of the kingdom, but was not the administrative centre, while suggesting other location in Muntilan as the possible political centre of the kingdom.\n\nMost of the time, the court of the Medang Kingdom was located in Mataram, possibly located somewhere in Muntilan or the Prambanan Plain near modern Yogyakarta. However, during the reign of Rakai Pikatan, the court was moved to Mamrati. Later, in the reign of Balitung, the court moved again, this time to Poh Pitu. Unlike Mataram, historians have been unable to pinpoint the possible locations of Mamrati and Poh Pitu, although most historians agree that both were located in the Kedu Plain, somewhere around the modern Magelang or Temanggung regencies. Later expert suggests that the area in Secang, on the upper Progo river valley in northern Magelang Regency — with relatively high temple density — was possibly the secondary political centre of the kingdom. In later Eastern Java period, other centres were mentioned; such as Tamwlang and Watugaluh (near Jombang), also Wwatan (near Madiun).\n\nDuring this period the administration level of Javanese polity was only consists of two levels; the central government level centred in king's court, and the \"wanua\" or village level took form of settlements scattered around within kingdom's realm. The palace where the King resided was mentioned as \"kadatwan\" or \"karaton\", the court was the centre of kingdom's administration. The \"wanua\" or village is more likely took shape of an \"island\" filled with housings and orchards in the middle of vast rice paddies, this village layout still can be found in modern Javanese \"desa\".\nThe King was regarded as the paramount ruler or \"chakravartin\", where the highest power and authority lies. He ruled the \"nagara\" or \"kadatwan\" which means the kingdom, from his \"puri\" (palace or walled compound). Under the king, there are state officials that serve to forward the king's laws and orders. They are using the title of \"Rakai\" or \"Samget\". The \"Rakais\" ruled an administrative unit called \" watak\" that formed from the collection of several villages or \"wanua\". \"Rakai\" can be considered as regional landlord or the landed gentry, that rule a large collection of villages. The \"rakais\" transmit the king's order to the \"Rama\" or village leaders that rules their own domain called \"karaman\" or \"watak\". As the kingdom grew larger and complex, entering the 10th century during the reign of Balitung, series of state officials are added to add hierarchy levels.\n\nMost of the inscriptions dated from Medang Mataram period are related to the establishment of \"sima\" lands. This signify the formation and expansion of Javanese agricultural villages in the region during this period. Either by opening a forest or converting a \"ladang\" (dry rice cultivation) to \"sawah\" (wet rice cultivation). A \"sima\" is an arable wet rice agricultural land with rice surpluses available for taxation, and officially recognised through royal edict. Most of these \"sima\" lands are ruled by regional \"rakai\" or \"samget\" (landed gentry) in their realm. By acquiring prestigious \"sima\" status from the king, a \"watak\" regional unit held a higher prestige compared to non-\"sima\" settlements, yet this also means acknowledging the kingdom's overlordship over their land and swore their allegiance to the king. The Rakais that rule the land are granted a royal permission to collect tax, yet some parts of these tax should be regularly paid to the king's court (central government in the capital). In some instance, some of these \"sima\" inscription stated that this \"sima\" land has become a tax-free land, in exchange that the rice harvest surpluses collected from this land are used to construct or maintain a religious building. This means the \"rakai\" that traditionally ruled this lands no longer has the right to collect the tax, or at least reducing their tax earnings.\n\nOther than their administrative and military-defense function, the king and the royal family is also known as the patron of arts and also religious piousness. The king, the royal family and the kingdom's officials had the authority to launch public projects, such as irrigation works or temple construction. The royal art and religious patronage can be seen in sponsoring temples constructions. The kingdom left behind several temples and monuments. The most notable ones are Borobudur, Prambanan, Sewu, and the Plaosan temple compound.\n\nThe common people of Medang mostly made a living in agriculture, especially as rice farmers, however, some may have pursued other careers, such as hunter, trader, artisan, weaponsmith, sailor, soldier, dancer, musician, food or drink vendor, etc. Rich portrayals of daily life in 9th century Java can be seen in many temple bas-reliefs. Rice cultivation had become the base for the kingdom's economy where the villages throughout the realm relied on their annual rice yield to pay taxes to the court. Exploiting the fertile volcanic soil of Central Java and the intensive wet rice cultivation (\"sawah\") enabled the population to grow significantly, which contributed to the availability of labour and workforce for the state's public projects. Certain villages and lands were given the status as \"sima\" lands awarded through royal edict written in inscriptions. The rice yields from \"sima\" lands usually were allocated for the maintenance of certain religious buildings.\n\nThe economic activity was also not solely centred in a single marketplace in the capital city. It is most likely that the marketplace was rotated in daily basis within a week among participating villages, in a Javanese system called \"pasaran\". This system still can be found in rural Javanese villages, before most are turned into a permanent marketplace as it is commonly found today. The economic trading practice in these marketplace are most likely done in barter as well as using money, as during this period, Javanese economy has been partly monetised.\n\nThe bas-reliefs from temples of this period, especially from Borobudur and Prambanan describe occupations and careers other than agricultural pursuit; such as soldiers, government officials, court servants, massage therapists, travelling musicians and dancing troupe, food and drink sellers, logistics courier, sailors, merchants, even thugs and robbers are depicted in everyday life of 9th century Java. These occupations requires economic system that employs currency. The Wonoboyo hoard, golden artefacts discovered in 1990, revealed gold coins in shape similar to corn seeds, which suggests that 9th century Javan economy is partly monetised. On the surface of the gold coins engraved with a script \"\"ta\"\", a short form of \"\"tail\"\" or \"\"tahil\"\" a unit of currency in ancient Java.\n\nA complex and stratified society of ancient Javanese people and their social order can be seen through studies on the rich portrayal in bas-reliefs from this period, as well as inscription studies. The kingdom had developed a complex society; which characterised by heterogeneity of their society, inequality of social stratification, and the formation of national administrative institution in their kingdom. The ancient Javanese did recognise the Hindu \"catur varna\" or caste social classes; Brahmana (priests), Kshatriya (kings, warlords and nobles), Vaishya (traders and artisans), and Shudra (servants and slaves). Nevertheless, the social stratification system in ancient Java slightly differ from those of India, as it less rigid.\n\nPigeaud divides ancient Javanese society into four classes: the ruling class, religious authority, commoners, and slaves. While de Casparis suggest; although the ancient Javanese society recognise caste differences, their rules and implementations was less rigid compared to those caste system in India. De Casparis divides them into three groups:\n\nBased on the study of the styles and types of clothing and jewelries worn by people depicted in bas-reliefs from the temple — especially Borobudur reliefs — the ancient Javanese society roughly can be divided into:\n\nHinduism and Buddhism are the two religions adhered by the rulers and people of the kingdom. Nevertheless, the commoners' religious practices were probably still mixed with native shamanism and indigenous pre-Dharmic beliefs. Since the beginning of its formation, the Medang Mataram kings seemed to favour Shivaist Hinduism, such as the construction of linga in Gunung Wukir Hindu temple as mentioned in Canggal inscription by king Sanjaya. However, during the reign of Panangkaran, Mahayana Buddhism began to blossomed and gain court favour. The Kalasan, Sari, Sewu, Mendut, Pawon and the magnificent Borobudur temples testify the Buddhist renaissance in Central Java. The court patronage on Buddhism spanned from the reign of Panangkaran to Samaratungga. During the reign of Pikatan, Shivaist Hinduism began to regain court's favour, signified by the construction of grand Shivagrha (Prambanan).\nThe kingdom recognised the religious authority of priest class, the brahmins. Buddhism was also well represented through the sangha Buddhist monastic community, consists of Buddhist monks living in viharas such as Sari and Plaosan and gaining court patronage. These Hindu and Buddhist religious authorities conducted state's and regional religious rituals and ceremonies in the temples. The ruling class of kshatriya royal family also indulged in spiritualism. Some monarch seems to immerse themselves in spiritualism and religion. For example, King Panangkaran seems to be deeply influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, and even strive to become a hermit during his later days. Numbers of other kings such as Samaragrawira and Samaratungga was also deeply influenced by Buddhism and strive to become a benevolent leaders. Rakai Pikatan also abdicated and renounced worldly affairs during his old days and become a rishi hermit named Sang Prabhu Jatiningrat.\n\nThe period between the reign of King Panangkaran to the reign of King Balitung (late 8th century to the early 10th century) saw a fervent temple construction in the kingdom. This was probably motivated either by religious zeal, kingdom's immense wealth and resources or social-political reasons. Some historians such as Munoz suggest, that this ardent temple construction projects was actually a religious-political tool to control the regional \"Rakai\" landlords, to prevent them from rebelling against the king. During this time, each of regional \"watak\" are ruled by \"Rakai\" landlords that nurturing their own dynasty. By appointing the Rakais' \"sima\" land to fund the construction and maintenance of a \"candi\" religious building, the Maharaja depriving the Rakais' ability to collect large sum of tax, that can be potentially misused to fund some army that might rose to challenge the Maharaja's authority. The Rakais might be willingly or reluctantly compliant to the king's will, for refusing to construct religious building might harm their reputation, and cast them not only as the enemy of the king, but also as the enemy of gods or Buddha.\n\nOther than examining bas-reliefs carved on the temple's walls, the study of ancient Javanese society is also conducted through archaeological relics. The Wonoboyo hoard golden artefacts attest to the wealth, art, and culture as well as the aesthetic achievement of the Medang Kingdom. The artefacts show the intricate artwork and technical mastery of the ancient Javanese goldsmith. The hoard was estimated to date from the reign of King Balitung. The treasure has been identified as belonging to a noble or a member of the royal family.\n\nThe earliest temple in the Southern Central Java Mataram region was the Hindu Shivaist Gunung Wukir temple, linked to Canggal inscription (732 CE) built by King Sanjaya. Almost 50 years later the oldest Buddhist temple was built in Prambanan region, the Buddhist Kalasan temple, linked to Kalasan inscription (778 CE) and King Panangkaran. From this time, the kingdom saw exuberant temple construction projects, such as Sari, Manjusrigrha, Lumbung, Ngawen, Mendut, Pawon and peaked in the construction of Borobudur, the massive stone mandala, that took shape of a mountain temple pinnacled with stupas that completed c. 825 CE.\n\nThe monumental Hindu temple of Prambanan in the vicinity of Yogyakarta — initially built during the reign of King Pikatan (838—850), and expanded continuously through the reign of Lokapala (850—890) to Balitung (899–911) — is a fine example of ancient Medang Mataram art and architecture. The description of a grand temple compound dedicated for lord Shiva, and the public project to shift the course of the river near the temple (Opak river) to run straight along western wall of temple compound was also mentioned in Shivagrha inscription. The grand temple complex was dedicated to the \"Trimurti\", the three highest gods in the Hindu pantheon (Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu). It was the largest Hindu temple ever built in Indonesia, evidence of the immense wealth and cultural achievement of the kingdom.\n\nOther Hindu temples dated from Medang Mataram Kingdom era are: Sambisari, Gebang, Barong, Ijo, and Morangan. Although the Shivaist regain the favour, Buddhist remain under royal patronage. The Sewu temple dedicated for Manjusri according to Kelurak inscription was probably initially built by Panangkaran, but later expanded and completed during Rakai Pikatan's rule, whom married to a Buddhist princess Pramodhawardhani, daughter of Samaratungga. Most of their subjects retained their old religion; Shivaists and Buddhists seemed to co-exist in harmony. The Buddhist temple of Plaosan, Banyunibo and Sajiwan were built during the reign of King Pikatan and Queen Pramodhawardhani, probably in the spirit of religious reconciliation after the succession disputes between Pikatan-Pramodhawardhani against Balaputra.\n\nFrom the 9th to mid 10th centuries, the Medang Kingdom witnessed the blossoming of art, culture and literature, mainly through the translation of Hindu-Buddhist sacred texts and the transmission and adaptation of Hindu-Buddhist ideas into Old Javanese text and visual bas-reliefs rendering. The bas-relief carved on each sides of Mendut temple stairs and also on the base of Sojiwan temple for example, narrating the popular Jataka Buddhist tales, the stories that tell about the previous lives of the Buddha, in both human and animal form. The Borobudur bas-relief particularly, contains the most complete rendering of Buddhist sacred texts. Ranged from Karmavibhanga (the law of karma), Lalitavistara (the story of the Buddha), the tale of Manohara, Jataka and Jatakamala, Avadana (collection of virtuous deeds) and Gandavyuha (Sudhana's quest for the ultimate truth).\n\nThe bas-relief narration of the Hindu epic \"Ramayana\" and also was carved on the wall of Prambanan temple's Shiva and Brahma temples, while the stories of Krishna taken from Bhagavata Purana was carved on Vishnu temple. During this period, the Kakawin \"Ramayana\", an old Javanese rendering was written. This Kakawin Ramayana, also called the \"Yogesvara Ramayana\", is attributed to the scribe Yogesvara c. the 9th century CE, who was employed in the court of the Medang in Central Java. It has 2774 stanzas in the \"manipravala\" style, a mixture of Sanskrit and archaic Javanese prose. The most influential version of the \"Ramayana\" is the \"Ravanavadham\" of Bhatti, popularly known as \"Bhattikavya\". The Javanese \"Ramayana\" differs markedly from the original Hindu.\n\nMedang kingdom had an exceptionally intense relations with the regional hegemon Srivijaya of Sumatra. In earlier period, the relations was close and intimate, as Sailendran kings of Java has formed an alliance with Maharaja of Srivijaya and the two royal houses seems to be merged. In later period however, the relations was deteriorated to warfare, as Dharmawangsa launched failed attempt to capture Palembang, and Srivijaya well-crafted retaliation ensued. In its eastern boundary, the Medang kingdom seems to subjugate the neighboring Bali, and pulled the island into its sphere of influence.\nThe Khmer art and architecture during the formative early Angkor era also believed to being influenced by Javanese art and architecture; the striking similarity of the Bakong temple in Cambodia to Borobudur, strongly suggests that Bakong was inspired by Borobudur's design. There must had been exchanges of travellers, if not mission, between Kambuja and Java. Transmitting to Cambodia not only ideas, but also technical and architectural details, including arched gateways in corbelling method.\n\nThe Kaladi inscription (c. 909 CE), mentioned \"Kmir\" (Khmer people of the Khmer Empire) together with \"Campa\" (Champa) and \"Rman\" (Mon) as foreigners from mainland Southeast Asia that frequently came to Java to trade. The inscription suggests a maritime trade network has been established between kingdoms in mainland Southeast Asia and Java.\n\nThe name of the Medang Kingdom was mentioned in the Laguna Copperplate Inscription of the Philippines' Tondo, dated 822 saka (c. 900 CE), discovered in Lumban, Laguna, Philippines. The discovery of the inscriptions, written in the Kawi script in a variety of Old Malay containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between Old Javanese and Old Tagalog, suggests that the people or officials of the Medang Kingdom had embarked on inter-insular trade and foreign relations in regions as far away as the Philippines, and that connections between ancient kingdoms in Indonesia and the Philippines existed.\n\nCelebrated as the golden age of ancient Indonesian civilisation — more precisely classic Javanese civilisation — the era of Medang i Bhumi Mataram kingdom has left an everlasting mark and legacy in Indonesian culture and history; their monuments. The grand and magnificent Borobudur and Prambanan in particular, has become the source of national pride, not only for local Javanese but also for the whole of Indonesians. It is probably in the same fashion as how Khmer people of Cambodia took pride in their Angkorian legacy. These monuments today has become the nation's major attraction; Borobudur is the single most visited tourist attraction in Indonesia.\n\nNever before — and again — that Indonesia saw such vigorous passion for development and temple construction, which demonstrate such technological mastery, labour and resource management, aesthetics and art refinement, also architectural achievement, other than this era. The period between the late 8th century to the late 9th century, between the reign of Panangkaran to Balitung, has left numbers of impressive religious monuments; among others are Manjusrigrha, Bhumisambharabudhara and Shivagrha.\nThe Medang Mataram era is hailed as the classical period of Javanese civilisation; for during this period the Javanese culture, art and architecture was blossoming and developed further, consolidated and mixed their indigenous elements with dharmic influences. By incorporating Hindu-Buddhist frame of reference and elements into their culture, art and architecture, and by Sanskritization their language, Javanese has formulating their own Hindu-Buddhist Javanese style and developing an ingenious civilisation. This Javanese style of Sailendran art, either in sculpture and architecture, in return influenced regional arts, particularly the Srivijayan art in Sumatra and Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula.\n\nIt was also during this period that numbers of dharmic scriptures either Hindu or Buddhist, has made their way from India into Javanese culture. For example, the tales of Buddhist Jatakas and Lalitavistara, also Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata were adopted into Javanese version. These tales and epics would further shaped the Javanese culture and performing arts, such as Javanese dances and wayang art.\n\nThe ruler of Medang Kingdom.\n\n\n"}

The case of a degree-2 (quadratic) polynomial formula_1, where formula_2 is not a square, is common and can be expressed in terms of Lucas sequences formula_3 and formula_4, leading to fast implementations for testing pseudoprimality.\n\nA composite number \"n\" is a Frobenius formula_5 pseudoprime if and only if formula_6,\nand\nwhere formula_9 is the Jacobi symbol.\n\nBoth conditions hold for all primes, hence this constitutes a probable prime test.\n\nCondition (1) is the same condition that defines a Lucas pseudoprime, hence every Frobenius formula_5 pseudoprime is also a Lucas formula_5 pseudoprime, but because of the additional condition (2), the converse is not true. On the other hand, some Frobenius pseudoprimes are not strong Lucas pseudoprimes for the same parameters, e.g. 6721 is the first such number for formula_12.\n\nFrobenius pseudoprimes with respect to the Fibonacci polynomial formula_13 are determined in terms of the Fibonacci numbers formula_14 and Lucas numbers formula_15. Such Frobenius pseudoprimes form the sequence:\n\nWhile 323 is the first Lucas pseudoprime with respect to the Fibonacci polynomial formula_13, the first Frobenius pseudoprime with respect to the same polynomial is 4181 (Grantham indicates it is 5777 but multiple authors have noted this is incorrect and is instead the first pseudoprime with formula_17 for this polynomial).\n\nAnother case, Frobenius pseudoprimes with respect to the quadratic polynomial formula_18 can be determined using the Lucas (3,-1) sequence and are:\n\nIn this case, the first Frobenius pseudoprime with respect to the quadratic polynomial formula_18 is 119, which is also the first Lucas pseudoprime with respect to the same polynomial. Besides, formula_20.\n\nThe quadratic polynomial formula_21, with formula_22, has sparse pseudoprimes as compared to many other simple quadratics. Using the same process as above, we get the sequence:\n\nNotice there are only 3 such pseudoprimes below 500000, while there are many Frobenius (1, −1) and (3, −1) pseudoprimes below 500000.\n\nEvery entry in this sequence is a Fermat pseudoprime to base 5 as well as a Lucas (3, −5) pseudoprime, but the converse is not true: 642001 is both a psp-5 and a Lucas (3,-5) pseudoprime, but is not a Frobenius (3, −5) pseudoprime. (note that Lucas pseudoprime for a (\"P\", \"Q\") pair need not to be a Fermat pseudoprime for base \"Q\" or base −\"Q\", e.g. 14209 is a Lucas (1, −3) pseudoprime, but not a Fermat pseudoprime for base 3.\n\nUsing parameter selection ideas first laid out in Baillie and Wagstaff (1980)\nas part of the Baillie-PSW primality test and used by Grantham in his quadratic Frobenius test,\none can create even better quadratic tests. For instance, for the parameters (\"P\",2), where \"P\" is the first odd integer that satisfies formula_23, there are no pseudoprimes below formula_24.\n\nFor quadratic polynomials formula_25, every Frobenius (P,Q) pseudoprime is also a Lucas (P,Q) pseudoprime.\n\nThis immediately follows from condition (1) which defined a Lucas (P,Q) pseudoprime.\nThe converse is not true, making the Frobenius pseudoprimes a subset of the Lucas pseudoprimes for a given (P,Q). The condition on formula_26 means it is a Dickson pseudoprime of the second kind.\n\nEvery Frobenius pseudoprime to formula_27 is also a Perrin pseudoprime.\n\nAn alternate formulation is given by Khashin. Given a number \"n\", not a perfect square, where \"c\" is the smallest odd prime with Jacobi symbol formula_28, \"n\" is either a prime or Frobenius pseudoprime if:\n\nNote the additional condition of choosing a parameter based on the Jacobi symbol finding a quadratic non-residue. This is similar to the method from Baillie and Wagstaff shown in the examples section. This makes far stronger tests, and is one reason for the success of the Baillie-PSW primality test. Similar to the example, Khashin notes that no pseudoprime has been found for his test. He further shows that any that exist under 2 must have a factor less than 19 or have \"c\" > 128.\n\nStrong Frobenius pseudoprimes are also defined. Details on implementation for quadratic polynomials can be found in Crandall and Pomerance.\n\nThe computational cost of the Frobenius pseudoprimality test with respect to quadratic polynomials is roughly three times the cost of a strong pseudoprimality test (e.g. a single round of the Miller-Rabin primality test), 1.5 times that of a Lucas pseudoprimality test, and slightly more than a Baillie-PSW primality test.\n\nNote that the quadratic Frobenius test is stronger than the Lucas test. For example, 1763 is a Lucas pseudoprime to (\"P\", \"Q\") = (3, -1) since \"U\"(3,-1) ≡ 0 (mod 1763) (\"U\"(3,-1) is given in ), and it also passes the Jacobi step since formula_30, but it fails the Frobenius test to \"x\" - 3\"x\" - 1. This property can be clearly seen when the algorithm is formulated as shown in Crandall and Pomerance Algorithm 3.6.9 or as shown by Loebenberger, as the algorithm does a Lucas test followed by an additional check for the Frobenius condition.\n\nWhile the quadratic Frobenius test does not have formal error bounds beyond that of the Lucas test, it can be used as the basis for methods with much smaller error bounds. Note that these have more steps, additional requirements, and non-negligible additional computation beyond what is described on this page. It is important to note that the error bounds for these methods do not apply to the standard or strong Frobenius tests with fixed values of (P,Q) described on this page.\n\nBased on this idea of pseudoprimes, algorithms with strong worst-case error bounds can be built. The quadratic Frobenius test, using a quadratic Frobenius test plus other conditions, has a bound of formula_31. Müller in 2001 proposed the MQFT test with bounds of essentially formula_32.\n"}

He was drafted by the Chicago White Sox after being named an All-American at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo where he was a Physical Education major. It was at Cal Poly that he met his wife, Julie. Later, he held a small role as a third baseman in the film \"Bull Durham\". After an injury ended his sporting career—a player's cleats tore his Achilles tendon while he was fielding a ground ball—Gans turned to the entertainment industry. Gans began his career on the road, performing mostly at private corporate functions. In 1992, he played Dean Martin in the CBS miniseries \"Sinatra\".\n\nIn 1995, he moved to Broadway to perform a one-man show, but later decided to move to Las Vegas to reduce time away from his family, who lived in Los Angeles.\n\nGans started his Las Vegas stay at the Stratosphere Hotel in 1996. His show there was successful, and he moved over to The Rio in 1998. In 2000, Gans's show moved again, this time to The Mirage, where the \"Danny Gans Theatre\" was built for him.\n\nIn February 2009, Gans changed venues again and performed at Encore, the sister property to Wynn Las Vegas.

The cause of death was a drug toxicity caused by the combination of hydromorphone (an opiate, commonly marketed under the name Dilaudid) and a pre-existing heart condition. It was determined that his death was caused by an adverse drug reaction, and was not drug abuse-related.\n\nGans had three children, Amy, Andrew and Emily. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.\n\nGans had been noted many times for his role in \"Bull Durham\", although his part in the movie was ultimately downsized. He used this role as an addition to his resume, even going on Roy Firestone's show and promoting the role while holding a picture of himself from the movie to prove that he was, in fact, in it.\n\nGans played Roger in the TV series \"Silk Stalkings\" for 12 episodes (1991–92), played Scott Babylon in the series \"Duet\" (1987–89), and reprised his role in the series \"Open House\" (1989–90).

{"id": "2246397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246397", "title": "Red Screes", "text": "Red Screes\n\nRed Screes is a fell in the English Lake District, situated between the villages of Patterdale and Ambleside. It may be considered an outlier of the Fairfield group in the Eastern Fells, but is separated from its neighbours by low cols. This gives Red Screes an independence which is reflected in its prominence.\n\nRed Screes is a ridge of high ground which runs for nearly 7 km in a north north-easterly direction from the town of Ambleside, and reaches a maximum height of 776 m. This ridge narrows at either end, giving it the shape of a long upturned boat. It is separated from neighbouring fells by Scandale Pass to the west (c.516 m) and Kirkstone Pass to the east (455 m). These two low cols mean that Red Screes is seen as an independent fell when viewed from the south of the Lake District. They also give the fell sufficient prominence to be classified as a Marilyn. There are two minor subsidiary tops: Snarker Pike (644 m) on the south ridge and Middle Dodd (654 m) on the north ridge. Each of these, however, has very little prominence above the ridge (less than 10 m).\n\nRed Screes forms part of the main watershed of the Lake District, which runs in an east-west direction across the summit and the two adjacent cols. All streams to the north eventually flow into the Solway Firth, and those to the south flow into Morecambe Bay. The boundaries of Red Screes are formed by the four streams in the adjacent valleys. To the south, Scandale Beck drains the western slopes and Stock Ghyll the eastern ones. These both join the River Rothay a few yards apart just to the west of Ambleside. To the north, Caiston Beck drains the western slopes and Kirkstone Beck the eastern ones, and these join where they reach more level ground at the end of the ridge. Thus the boundaries of Red Screes are formed symmetrically by four valleys, with the fell between them, rather than rising at the head of any one of them.\n\nThe broad southern ridge rises gently for four and a half kilometres from Ambleside. The lower slopes have been planted with small areas of mixed woodland and are extensively compartmentalised by an array of dry stone walls. North of the summit, the ridge narrows at Smallthwaite Band, before widening again to the summit of Middle Dodd. Beyond this, the descent is steep and rough though mainly grassy.\n\nThe western flanks are also rough, mainly grassy with some rock outcrops, rising steeply from Scandale and from Caiston Glen. The eastern side has been eroded by two steep corries (known at coves in Cumbria). These give it a more rocky appearance, with two miles of screeslope looming above almost the full length of Kirkstone Pass, and well seen from the A592 road which crosses the pass. It is from this view that the fell takes its name. Prominent on Ordnance Survey maps is Kilnshaw Chimney, although in reality this is just a narrow gully beneath the summit.\n\nThe summit area is a broad plateau with a dressing of grass and stones. Two unnamed corries are cut into the eastern face and between them a flat topped promontory juts out with the highest point on its northern edge. A number of large cairns have been built and an Ordnance Survey triangulation column stands nearby. Adjacent to that is a circular stone shelter. A few yards to the south is Red Screes Tarn, a small permanent waterbody with no plant life in evidence. A number of smaller pools can be found after rain. The view is excellent in all directions. Helvellyn is seen to good advantage, beyond the crags of Dove Crag and Fairfield and over Deepdale Hause. High Street and the Far Eastern Fells are seen over the immediate bulk of Caudale Moor. To the west the skyline is formed by the distant Coniston, Bowfell and Scafell fells. The immediate view down the eastern face to the Kirkstone Inn is spectacular.\n\nWell-used paths approach the summit from four directions. From the south a track up the southern ridge gives convenient access directly from Ambleside, leaving the road towards ‘The Struggle’ about one mile north-east of the town. This leads over Snarker Pike before reaching the summit. From the east a very steep and winding path straight up from Kirkstone Pass is very popular with visitors. Considerable erosion to this path has been repaired by laying stone blocks along much of its length. From the west the path from Scandale Pass gives an easier approach, and may be gained from either Ambleside, or from the north via Caiston Glen. From the north a more direct approach over Middle Dodd is possible, but the way is very steep and unmarked. A path appears near the top of Middle Dodd, and then leads along the northern ridge to the summit of Red Screes.\n\nAll the rocks of Red Screes are part of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, formed on the margin of an ancient continent during a period of intense volcanic activity during the Caradoc epoch of the Ordovician period, roughly 450 million years ago.\n\nThe lowest (and oldest) rocks, around the base of the fell and on the southern half of the south ridge, belong to the Seathwaite Fell Sandstone Formation. This consists mainly of deposits of bedded volcaniclastic sandstone and siltstone, deposited rapidly in shallow water at a late stage during the volcanic activity. South of Snarker Pike there are more than 800 m of these sediments. Interbedded pyroclastic rocks vary from thin beds of fine tuff to thick units of breccia, and reveal some ongoing volcanic activity during the period of deposition.\n\nOverlying those deposits are rocks of the Lincomb Tarns Tuff Formation, found on the eastern and western sides of the fell and the top of the southern ridge. These rocks are predominantly dacitic lapilli-tuff, interpreted as welded ignimbrite. Interbeds of thin tuff and of volcaniclastic sandstone occur. This formation is the most widespread in the volcanic rocks of the Lake District; it seems that the whole district was buried beneath at least 150 m (and in places up to 800 m) of densely welded ignimbrite. It must have been a series of eruptions of truly exceptional magnitude, as viscous and highly gaseous silica-rich magma exploded on eruption.\n\nIntrusions of the Borrowdale Sill Suite are found on Red Screes within both the rock formations just described. These andesite sills were intruded during the volcanic activity of the Caradoc Epoch, and may represent one of the last episodes when magma rose to or near the surface that is preserved in the volcanic rocks of the Lake District.\n\nOverlying the Lincomb Tarns Formation are rocks of the Esk Pike Sandstone Formation. On Red Screes these are found high on the northern ridge. In this area the formation consists of alternating thick pebbly sandstone beds and thin beds of finer-grained sandstone and mudstone. These represent a return to water-borne sedimentation in an environment of rivers and lakes.\n\nThe highest and youngest rocks of the Borrowdale volcanic sequence found on Red Screes belong to the Middle Dodd Dacite Formation, on and north of the top of Middle Dodd, and with a small area along the edge of the northern corrie of Red Screes. The rock is white-weathered dacite lava, and was formed by the eruption of viscous or semi-mobile lava rich in silica from a steep-sided volcano, perhaps filling in hollows on an old erosion surface.\n\nDrift deposits of glacial till derived from the last ice-age have accumulated on the lower slopes of Red Screes, and on the top of the ridge.\n\nKirkstone Quarry (named Pets Quarry on Ordnance Survey maps) is prominent on the southeast side of Red Screes, below Kirkstone Pass. It has produced green and blue-black slate for building and architectural purposes. The quarry went into administration in 2012. At present Burlington Stone markets three types of stone called Kirkstone Brathay Blue/Black, Kirkstone Sea Green and Kirkstone Silver Green. Quarrying took place within the Seathwaite Fell Sandstone Formation. The green slate was formed from fine-grained sedimentary rock within that formation, which was later metamorphosed to form slate.\n\nThe remains of a small quarry on the western slopes of the fell can still be seen. This was used to extract stones for wall-building, and even the remains of a sled-track exist, leading down to a series of field walls in Scandale.\n\nThere is evidence of mining in Caiston Glen, with the mouth of a level opening about halfway up the beck. This was an unsuccessful trial for lead and extends about 80 ft into the fellside. There is a further small working nearby.\n\nThere are also the remains of a trial for copper on the eastern flank, a 120-foot level being driven into the fell from close to the modern road.\n\nRed Screes is an example of a fell which has taken the name of one of its sides. The screes which cover the steep eastern slopes above the Kirkstone Pass appear to have a reddish colouration.\n\nSnarker Pike is probably ‘snake peak’ from Old English \"snaca\", a snake, plus pike. In 1764 its name was recorded as \"Snake Pike\". Originally it may have been Snake How (from \"snaca\" plus dialect \"how(e)\", a hill or mound), which became contracted to Snarker and then had ‘pike’ added. It seems strange that this hill should be associated with snakes, though adders are not uncommon in the Lake District. Pike is a dialect work for a peak or summit, from either Old English \"pīc\" or Old Norse \"pík\". This is frequently used for the summit of a fell, and then for the fell itself. Some of these names are ancient, but many are more modern.\n\nMiddle Dodd is the central of the three dodds as seen from Hartsop Hall: (Low) Hartsop Dodd, Middle Dodd and High Hartsop Dodd. These names have nothing to do with relative heights but refer to their positions in the valley. Dod or dodd is a dialect word of unknown origin, but common in hill names in the Lake District and the Scottish Borders for bare rounded summits, either free standing or subsidiary shoulders to higher neighbours. \n"}

His precise measurements of mass differences between nuclear isotopes allowed him to confirm Albert Einstein's mass-energy equivalence concept. He was the Director of the Manhattan Project's Trinity nuclear test, which took place July 16, 1945. Bainbridge described the Trinity explosion as a \"foul and awesome display\". He remarked to J. Robert Oppenheimer immediately after the test, \"Now we are all sons of bitches.\" This marked the beginning of his dedication to ending the testing of nuclear weapons and to efforts to maintain civilian control of future developments in that field.\n\nKenneth Tompkins Bainbridge was born in Cooperstown, New York, the second of three sons of William Warin Bainbridge and Mary Grinnell Tompkins. He was educated at Horace Mann School in New York. While at high school he developed an interest in ham radio which inspired him to enter Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1921 to study electrical engineering. In five years he earned both bachelor of science (S.B.) and master of science (S.M.) degrees. During the summer breaks he worked at General Electric's laboratories in Lynn, Massachusetts and Schenectady, New York. While there he obtained three patents related to photoelectric tubes.\n\nNormally this would have been a promising start to a career at General Electric, but it made Bainbridge aware of how interested he was in physics. Upon graduating from MIT in 1926, he enrolled at Princeton University, where Karl T. Compton, a consultant to General Electric, was on the faculty. In 1929, he was awarded a Ph.D. in his new field, writing his thesis on \"A search for element 87 by analysis of positive rays\" under the supervision of Henry DeWolf Smyth.\n\nBainbridge enjoyed a series of prestigious fellowships after graduation. He was awarded a National Research Council, and then a Bartol Research Foundation fellowship. At the time the Franklin Institute's Bartol Research Foundation was located on the Swarthmore College campus in Pennsylvania, and was directed by W. F. G. Swann, an English physicist with an interest in nuclear physics. Bainbridge married Margaret (\"Peg\") Pitkin, a member of the Swarthmore teaching faculty, in September 1931. They had a son, Martin Keeler, and two daughters, Joan and Margaret Tomkins.\n\nIn 1932, Bainbridge developed a mass spectrometer with a resolving power of 600 and a relative precision of one part in 10,000. He used this instrument to verify Albert Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, E = mc. Francis William Aston wrote that:\n\nIn 1933, Bainbridge was awarded a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship, which he used to travel to England and work at Ernest Rutherford's Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. While there he continued his work developing the mass spectrograph, and became friends with the British physicist John Cockcroft.\n\nWhen his Guggenheim fellowship expired in September 1934, he returned to the United States, where he accepted an associate professorship at Harvard University. He started by building a new mass spectrograph that he had designed with at the Cavendish Laboratory. Working with J. Curry Street, he commenced work on a cyclotron. They had a design for a cyclotron provided by Ernest Lawrence, but decided to build a cyclotron instead.\nBainbridge was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1937. His interest in mass spectroscopy led naturally to an interest in the relative abundance of isotopes. The discovery of nuclear fission in uranium-235 led to an interest in separating this isotope. He proposed using a Holweck pump to produce the vacuum necessary for this work, and enlisted George B. Kistiakowsky and E. Bright Wilson to help. There was little interest in their work because research was being carried out elsewhere. In 1943, their cyclotron was requisitioned by Edwin McMillan for use by the U. S. Army. It was packed up and carted off to Los Alamos, New Mexico.\n\nIn September 1940, with World War II raging in Europe, the British Tizard Mission brought a number of new technologies to the United States, including a cavity magnetron, a high-powered device that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field. This device, which promised to revolutionize radar, demolished any thoughts the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense Research Committee established the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop this radar technology. In October, Bainbridge became one of the first scientists to be recruited for the Radiation Laboratory by Ernest Lawrence. The scientists divided up the work between them; Bainbridge drew pulse modulators. Working with the Navy, he helped develop high-powered radars for warships.\nIn May 1943, Bainbridge joined Robert Oppenheimer's Project Y at Los Alamos. He initially led E-2, the instrumentation group, which developed X-ray instrumentation for examining explosions. In March 1944, he became head of a new group, E-9, which was charged with conducting the first nuclear test. In Oppenheimer's sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory in August 1944, the E-9 Group became X-2.\n\nOn July 16, 1945, Bainbridge and his colleagues conducted the Trinity nuclear test. \"My personal nightmare,\" he later wrote, \"was knowing that if the bomb didn't go off or hangfired, I, as head of the test, would have to go to the tower first and seek to find out what had gone wrong.\" To his relief, the explosion of the first atomic bomb went off without such drama, in what he later described as \"a foul and awesome display\". He turned to Oppenheimer and said, \"Now we are all sons of bitches.\"\n\nBainbridge was relieved that the Trinity test had been a success, relating in a 1975 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists article, \"I had a feeling of exhilaration that the 'gadget' had gone off properly followed by one of deep relief. I wouldn't have to go to the tower to see what had gone wrong.\"\n\nFor his work on the Manhattan Project, Bainbridge received two letters of commendation from the project's director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr.. He also received a Presidential Certificate of Merit for his work at the MIT Radiation Laboratory.\n\nBainbridge returned to Harvard after the war, and initiated the construction of a 96-inch synchro-cyclotron, which has since been dismantled. From 1950 to 1954, he chaired the physics department at Harvard. During those years, he drew the ire of Senator Joseph McCarthy for his aggressive defense of his colleagues in academia. As chairman, he was responsible for the renovation of the old Jefferson Physical Laboratory, and he established the Morris Loeb Lectures in Physics. He also devoted a good deal of his time to improving the laboratory facilities for graduate students.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Bainbridge remained an outspoken proponent of civilian control of nuclear power and the abandonment of nuclear testing. In 1950 he was one of twelve prominent scientists who petitioned President Harry S. Truman to declare that the United States would never be the first to use the hydrogen bomb. Bainbridge retired from Harvard in 1975.\n\nBainbridge's wife Margaret died suddenly in January 1967 from a blood clot in a broken wrist. He married Helen Brinkley King, an editor at William Morrow in New York City, in October 1969. She died in February 1989. A scholarship was established at Sarah Lawrence College in her memory. He died at his home in Lexington, Massachusetts, on July 14, 1996. He was survived by his daughters from his first marriage, Joan Bainbridge Safford and Margaret Bainbridge Robinson. He was buried in the Abel's Hill Cemetery on Martha's Vineyard, in a plot with his first wife Margaret and his son Martin. His papers are in the Harvard University Archives.\n\n\n"}

It was reported, though no proof is forthcoming, that Mme. Filleul had been the mistress of Louis XV and most royal genealogists give hers as his daughters, although never recognized. Her husband became one of the king's secretaries, and Mme. Filleul made many friends, among them Jean-François Marmontel. Their eldest daughter, Marie Françoise Julie Filleul (Château de Longpré, 1751Paris, 1822) married at the Château de Menars in 1767 Abel François Poisson, marquis de Vandières et de Marigny (1727–1781), the brother of Madame de Pompadour; Adélaïde-Émilie married on 30 January 1779 Alexandre Sébastien de Flahaut de La Billarderie, comte de Flahaut de La Billarderie, a soldier of some reputation, who was many years her senior.\n\nIn Paris she soon gathered round her a salon, in which the principal figure was Charles Maurice de Talleyrand. There are many allusions to their liaison in the diary of Gouverneur Morris, who was another of her lovers. In 1785 was born her son Charles Joseph, comte de Flahaut, who was generally known to be Talleyrand's son. Mme de Flahaut fled from Paris in 1792 and joined the society of \"émigré\"s at Mickleham, Surrey, described in Mme. d'Arblay's \"Memoirs\". Her husband remained at Boulogne-sur-Mer, where he was arrested on 29 January 1793 and guillotined. Mme. de Flahaut now supported herself by writing novels, of which the first, \"Adèle de Sénanges\" (London, 1794), which is partly autobiographical, was the most famous.\n\nShe presently left London for Switzerland, where she met Louis Philippe, duke of Orleans. She travelled in his company to Hamburg, where she lived for two years, earning her living as a milliner. She returned to Paris in 1798, and on 17 October 1802 she married Dom José Maria de Sousa Botelho Mourão e Vasconcelos (Porto, 9 March 1758Paris, 1 June 1825), Portuguese minister plenipotentiary in Paris, 2nd Lord of the Majorat of Mateus, who was previously married in Lisbon on 23 November 1783 to Dona Maria Teresa de Noronha, of the Lords of the Majorat of os Apréstimos, by whom he had an only son, future 1st Count of Vila Real. Her husband was recalled in 1804, and was offered the Saint Petersburg embassy; but in the next year he resigned, to settle permanently in Paris, where he had many friends, among them the historian Jean Charles Leonard de Sismondi. He spent his time chiefly in the preparation of a beautiful edition of the \"Lusiads\" of Luís de Camões, which he completed in 1817.\n\nMme. de Souza lost her social power after the fall of the First Empire, and was deserted even by Talleyrand, although he continued his patronage of Charles de Flahaut. Her husband died in 1825, and after the accession of Louis Philippe she lived in comparative retirement till her death. She brought up her grandson, Charles, duc de Morny, her son's natural son by Queen Hortense. Among her later novels were \"La Comtesse de Fargy\" (1822) and \"La Duchesse de Guise\" (1831). Her complete works were published between 1811 and 1822.\n"}

The film was written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, and stars Nicolas Cage as Johnny Blaze / Ghost Rider, with Eva Mendes, Wes Bentley, Sam Elliott, Donal Logue, Matt Long, and Peter Fonda in supporting roles.\n\n\"Ghost Rider\" was released on February 16, 2007 in the United States. The film was met with negative reviews from critics, but was a box office success, earning $228.7 million worldwide on a $110 million budget. \"Ghost Rider\" was released on DVD, Blu-ray and UMD on June 12, 2007. A sequel, titled \"\", was released on February 17, 2012, with Cage reprising his role.\n\nThe demon Mephistopheles sends his bounty hunter of the damned, the Ghost Rider, to retrieve the contract of San Venganza for control of a thousand corrupt souls. Seeing that the contract would give Mephistopheles the power to bring hell on Earth, the Rider refuses and escapes with it.\n\nIn 1986, Mephistopheles reaches out to 17-year-old Johnny Blaze, offering to cure his father's cancer in exchange for Johnny's soul. The next morning, Johnny awakens to discover the cancer cured, but his father then dies from burns sustained in a stunt accident. Johnny accuses Mephistopheles of causing his father's death, but Mephistopheles considers their contract fulfilled and promises to see him again.\n\nIn 2007, Johnny has become a famous stunt motorcycle rider, and runs into his former sweetheart Roxanne Simpson, now a news reporter, whom he abandoned after his father's death. He convinces her to attend a dinner date. Mephistopheles’ son Blackheart comes to Earth and seeks the aid of the Hidden - three fallen angels bonded with the elements of air, earth, and water - to find the lost contract of San Venganza. Mephistopheles makes Johnny the new Ghost Rider and offers to return his soul if he defeats Blackheart. Johnny transforms into the Ghost Rider- his body burning,skin falling up to his skeleton,which too burns forever- and kills the earth angel Gressil. He then uses the Penance Stare – a power that causes mortals to feel all the pain they have caused others which sears their soul – on a thug. The next day, he meets a man called the Caretaker, who knows about the Ghost Rider's history, assuring Johnny that what happened was real and will happen again, especially at night when he is near an evil soul.\n\nArriving home, Johnny finds Roxanne waiting and reveals himself as the Devil's bounty hunter. Unconvinced, she walks away in disbelief. After a brief imprisonment for murders Blackheart committed, Johnny kills the air angel Abigor and escapes from the police. He returns to the Caretaker, who tells him of his predecessor Carter Slade, a Texas Ranger who hid the contract of San Venganza. At home, Johnny discovers that Blackheart has killed his friend Mack and taken Roxanne captive, intending to kill her if Johnny does not deliver the contract. Johnny tries to use the Penance Stare on Blackheart but it proves ineffective as Blackheart has no soul. Blackheart then orders Johnny to retrieve the contract and bring it to him in San Venganza.\n\nJohnny returns to the Caretaker, demanding the contract to save Roxanne. The Caretaker reveals that it is hidden inside a spade and telling Johnny that he is more powerful than his predecessors because he sold his soul for love rather than greed before giving the contract after an initial distrust. The Caretaker then transforms with Blaze now knowing that the Caretaker was actually Carter Slade. Slade then leads Johnny to San Venganza and gives him a lever-action shotgun before saying his goodbyes and then fading away.\n\nAfter killing the water angel Wallow, Johnny gives Blackheart the contract. He transforms into the Ghost Rider to subdue Blackheart, but is rendered powerless at sunrise. Using the contract to absorb the thousand souls, Blackheart attempts to kill Johnny but is distracted when Roxanne uses Johnny's discarded shotgun to separate them. Johnny shoots Blackheart with the shotgun, that turns into a hellfire shotgun due to being in the shadows, and uses his Penance Stare to render him catatonic, burning all the corrupt souls within Blackheart.\n\nMephistopheles then appears and returns Johnny his soul, offering to take back the curse of the Ghost Rider. Determined not to make another deal, Johnny declines, declaring he will use his power against the demon and against all harm that comes to the innocent. Infuriated, Mephistopheles vows to make Johnny pay and disappears with Blackheart's body. Roxanne tells Johnny that he has his second chance and kisses him. Johnny rides away on his motorcycle, preparing for his new life as the Ghost Rider.\n\n\nMarvel began development for \"Ghost Rider\" as early as 1992 and were in discussions with potential producers to sell the rights to. In 1997 Gale Anne Hurd was listed as producer, with Jonathan Hensleigh attached to write the script. David S. Goyer developed a script and in May 2000 Marvel announced an agreement with Crystal Sky Entertainment to film \"Ghost Rider\" with actor Jon Voight attached as a producer. Production was scheduled to start in early 2001 with a budget of $75 million and Johnny Depp expressing interest in the lead role. The following August, Dimension Films joined Crystal Sky to co-finance the film, which would be directed by Stephen Norrington. Producer Avi Arad approached Eric Bana on the possibility of playing Ghost Rider, but opted to cast him in \"Hulk\" instead. In June 2001, actor and Ghost Rider fan Nicolas Cage entered talks to be cast into the lead role, after having found out about Depp being a possibility for the role and contacted the director to express his own interest. Norrington would drop out within a few months due his commitment to \"Tick Tock\" and Cage eventually left the project as well. By May 2002 Columbia Pictures sought to acquire rights to \"Ghost Rider\" in turnaround from Dimension Films following their success with \"Spider-Man\". They brought Shane Salerno to rewrite Goyer's script.\n\nIn April 2003, under Columbia Pictures, director Mark Steven Johnson took over the helm for \"Ghost Rider\" with Cage returning for the lead role. Johnson, rewriting Salerno's script, was set to begin production of \"Ghost Rider\" in late 2003 or early 2004. but it was delayed to October 2003. Cage took a temporary leave of absence to film \"The Weather Man\". \"Ghost Rider\" production was slated to tentatively begin in May or June 2004.\n\n\"Ghost Rider\" had again been delayed to begin in late 2004, but the lack of a workable script continued to delay production. In January 2005, actor Wes Bentley was cast as the villain Blackheart, having been introduced to Johnson by Colin Farrell, who had worked with the director in \"Daredevil\". Actress Eva Mendes was also cast opposite Cage as Roxanne Simpson. On February 14, 2005, \"Ghost Rider\" commenced filming in Australia at the Melbourne Docklands film studios. Then in March 2005, actor Peter Fonda (who starred in \"Easy Rider\") was cast as the villain Mephistopheles. Johnson originally planned to film before an audience at the Telstra Dome, but instead opted to create a crowd using computer-generated imagery. The director also chose to film in the motorcycle district of Melbourne. By June 2005, principal photography had been completed for \"Ghost Rider\", which was set for a summer 2006 release. In April 2006, the cast and crew performed last-minute reshoots in Vancouver. \"Ghost Rider\" was originally scheduled to release on August 4, 2006, but the date was moved three weeks earlier to July 14, 2006. Sony changed the film's release date once more to February 16, 2007 to help relieve the studio's crowded 2006 calendar.\n\nInstead of a \"hard drinking and smoking bad ass\" Johnny Blaze, Nicolas Cage decided to give him more depth. \"I'm playing him more as someone who... made this deal and he's trying to avoid confronting it, anything he can do to keep it away from him\". Cage also explained that Blaze's stunt riding was a form of escape and a way to keep him connected to his deceased father, who taught him to ride. Cage rode a Buell motorcycle for Blaze's stunt cycle, and a heavily customized hardtail chopper named \"Grace\" which transforms into the \"Hell Cycle\". The Hell Cycle's wheels, made of pure flames in the comics, were changed to be solid tires covered in flames in order to give the motorcycle more weight onscreen.\n\nThe film's visual effects supervisor, Kevin Mack, and the visual effects team at Sony Pictures Imageworks handled the difficult task of creating computer-generated fire on a shot-by-shot basis. Ghost Rider's skull flames were designed to become smaller and blue to display any emotion other than rage. Kevin's Team at Imageworks also created computer-generated motorcycles, chains, water, black goo, dementors and buildings. To pull off such effects as the living morph where the hardtail chopper (\"Grace\") comes alive to become the \"Hell Cycle\" Sony enlisted teams of animators, models, effects artists, lighters & \"Flame\" artists. The department supervisors for these teams at Imageworks included Kevin Hudson, Brian Steiner, JD Cowels, Marco Marenghi, Joe Spadaro, Joanie Karnowski, Vincent Serritella & Patrick Witting. Patrick's team bore the brunt of the work as they created the fire using a custom pipeline that automated the set up starting with Maya animated geometry driving Maya Fluids, imported into Houdini and then rendered & composited on top of the live action plates. Patrick and his team set up the fire process and much of the front end automation was set up by Scott Palleiko and Joe Spadaro. The fire was then tweaked and manipulated to look and move believably by Patick's eleven man Houdini effects team. All of this was enabled by effects producers Daniel Kuehn and the Digital Effects Supervisor Kee-Suk 'Ken' Hahn.\n\nThe digital version of the hell cycle was modeled in detail by Kevin Hudson and based on the practical prop used in the film, it included animatable skeletal hands that came alive to wrap the gas tank during the supernatural transformation scene. The transformation scene was animated by Max Tyrie and finalized by Joe Spadaro. Each part of the \"Grace\" geometry had to match up and morph with a piece of geometry on the \"Hell Cycle\".\n\nGhost Rider's voice was manipulated by sound designer Dane Davis, who won an Academy Award for Sound Editing for \"The Matrix\". Davis filtered Cage's line readings through three different kinds of animal growls that were played backwards and covered separate frequencies. Davis then amplified the dialogue through a mechanical volumizer. Director Johnson described the sound as a \"deep, demonic, mechanical lion's roar\".\n\nIn December 2005, musical composer Christopher Young was announced to score \"Ghost Rider\". In addition, Spiderbait, a band that Johnson befriended during filming in Australia, performed a cover of \"\" for the end credits.\n\nIn May 2005, Sony Pictures launched the official website for \"Ghost Rider\".\n\nThe following July, the studio presented a \"Ghost Rider\" panel at Comic-Con International and screened a teaser for the audience. The teaser, which did not have finalized footage of the film, eventually leaked online. In the same month, Majesco Entertainment Company announced its deal with Marvel to acquire worldwide rights to produce the video game \"Ghost Rider\" for the PS2, PSP, and Game Boy Advance consoles.\n\nIn December 2005, the studio presented a first glimpse of Ghost Rider in a ten-second footage piece on the official site.\n\nIn April 2006, Sideshow Collectibles announced the sale of a Ghost Rider maquette based on the concept art of the film.\n\nThe following May, domestic and international teaser trailers for \"Ghost Rider\" were launched at Apple.\n\nThe Ghost Rider was also featured in a commercial for Jackson Hewitt Tax Services in which the character presented his income tax forms to a clerk for processing to receive a quick refund check.\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on June 12, 2007 as a single-disc Theatrical Cut DVD, two-disc Extended Cut DVD, Blu-ray Disc, and UMD. Special features on the Extended Cut DVD include two commentary tracks, a comic book history feature, and a making of the film featurette.\n\n\"Ghost Rider\" was commercially released in the United States on February 16, 2007. The film grossed $15,420,123 on its opening day, while earning $45,388,836 for its opening weekend. The film earned $52,022,908 over the four-day President's Day weekend, with a per-theater average of $US 14,374 in 3,619 theaters. The film's total earnings were $228,738,393 worldwide of which $115,802,596 was from North America.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, \"Ghost Rider\" has a score of 27% out of 139 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The site's critical consensus states: \"\"Ghost Rider\" is a sour mix of morose, glum histrionics amidst jokey puns and hammy dialogue\". Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 35 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave it a grade B.\n\nMichael Ordoña of the \"Los Angeles Times\" and Jeannette Catsoulis of the \"New York Times\" expressed disappointment in the film. Ordoña cited the \"satanic references\" and \"judgmental\" elements of Cage's character, and Catsoulis said Johnny Blaze is \"more funny than frightening\". Although Eric Alt of the \"Chicago Tribune\" praised the computer-generated effects of the film, he also criticized it, calling it a \"clumsy, lifeless outing\". IGN named the film the worst comic book film of the decade.\nThe film was nominated for one Razzie Award for Nicolas Cage as Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor. However, the film was also nominated for Best Horror Film at the Saturn Awards.\n\nA sequel, entitled \"Spirit of Vengeance\", started filming in November 2010 and was released on February 17, 2012. Cage reprised his role as Johnny Blaze and also portrayed Johnny Blaze in his Ghost Rider form. \"Crank\" filmmakers Neveldine/Taylor directed the film. The film received worse reviews than its predecessor, but was still a financial success.\n\nWhen asked about a potential third film Cage stated \"It’s possible, but it won’t be with me.\" In 2013 the rights reverted to Marvel Studios.\n\n\n"}

The NATO reporting name of the 9M120 missile is the AT-9 \"Spiral-2. It is the next major generation in the 9K114 Shturm (AT-6 Spiral) family. The missile has radio command guidance and is also a Beam riding SACLOS. This missile's primary variant was designed to defeat tanks with composite armour and explosive reactive armor. The 9M120 Ataka system is often confused with the 9K121 Vikhr system, despite being different weapons systems developed by different companies. The former was designed by the KBM machine-building design bureau and manufactured by the Degtyarev plant. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Russia exported the Ataka ATGM to Iran, Kazakhstan, and Slovenia.\n\nThe AT-9 missile was developed by the Kolomna engineering design bureau, located in Kolomna. This company already designed previous ATGMs, such as the AT-3 \"Sagger\" and AT-6 \"Spiral\" missiles. The design work began in the mid 1980s. The Ataka ATGM was designed as a successor model to the AT-6 \"Spiral\", which was introduced in the late 1970s. The AT-9 is a further development of the AT-6. Compared to its predecessor, the AT-9 is more resistant to electronic countermeasures, and has a greater hit accuracy and longer reach. The newly developed warhead allows for increased penetration power and effectiveness against explosive reactive armor. The first units were delivered in 1985 to the Soviet armed forces.\n\nThe missile has often been confused in the west with the 9A4172 Vikhr dual-purpose laser beam riding missile used on the Kamov helicopters and Sukhoi attack aircraft (as well as some Ukrainian Mi-24/35 upgrades). These systems are completely unrelated in their design and are in fierce competition. New light multifunctional guided missiles with increased range – up to 15 kilometers – have been developed and received for Russian attack helicopters on the outcomes of the military operation in Syria.\n\nThe Ataka missile is stored in a glass reinforced plastic tube, which also acts as its launcher. The missile is reported to be considerably faster than the 9K114 Shturm, with longer range than the original version. It still uses radio command guidance, but the system has been improved when compared to the earlier 9K114 Shturm.\n\nThe system is carried by the multiple kinds of helicopters including the Mi-28 and Mi-35. It is also offered for ground vehicles like the BMPT and the 9P149.\n\nThere are three main missiles that are compatible with the launch system. The first is a two-stage anti-armour weapon that features a tandem warhead for dealing with add-on armor. The second variant of the missile – designated as 9M120F – has a thermobaric warhead for use against infantry positions and bunkers. The third variant of the 9M120 Ataka is the 9M220, which features a proximity fused expanding rod warhead, providing the missile with air-to-air capability against low- and slow-flying aircraft.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Συρακοῦσαι) was an ancient Greek city-state, located on the east coast of Sicily. The city was founded by settlers from Corinth in 734 or 733 BC, and was conquered by the Romans in 212 BC, after which it became the seat of Roman rule in Sicily. Throughout much of its history as an independent city, it was governed by a succession of tyrants, with only short periods of democracy and oligarchy. While Pindar addressed the Deinomenids as kings (basileus) in his odes, it is not clear that this (or any other title) was officially used by any of the tyrants until Agathocles adopted the title in 304.\n\n\nThrasybulus was deposed in 465 and Syracuse had a republican government for the next sixty years. This period is usually known as the Second Democracy (465-405). The extent to which Syracuse was a democracy in the same sense as Athens during this period is debated.\n\n\n\nTimoleon revived a republican form of government in Syracuse, which continued after his death. This period is usually known as the Third Democracy (337-317). The name is misleading; for at least some of the period Syracuse was run as an oligarchy.\n\nNumismatic evidence suggests that republican government may have existed for a few years between the death of Agathokles and Hicetas' assumption of power; this is sometimes referred to as the Fourth Democracy (289-287?). Nothing is known about it.\n\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the devastating Roman defeat at the Battle of Cannae, Hieronymus entered into an alliance with Hannibal, which would ultimately decide the city's fate politically. As a result of Syracuse's support for Carthage, the Romans under Marcus Claudius Marcellus began besieging the city in 214 BC. Hieronymus was assassinated shortly thereafter and a republican government restored (the Fifth Democracy) but the city fell to the Romans in 212 BC.\n"}

As LRF member, Tiro Federal also took part of tournaments organised by the Argentine Football Association such as Copa de Honor Municipalidad de Buenos Aires, playing the final in 1915 although they lost to Racing Club.\n\nIn 1944 (13 years after the professionalization of the game in Argentina) Tiro Federal affiliated to the AFA, where the team competed in the second division, although it was later relegated to the third division after a restructure of the national leagues in 1949. In 1962 Tiro Federal withdrew its team 12 rounds before the end of the competition and was expelled from the AFA. Tiro then returned to play in the Rosario league, but then financial problems made the club leave the local league.\n\nBusinessman Carlos Dávola took over the management of the club at the end the 1990s, and started a very ambitious plan.

The park is adjacent to San Felasco County Park and is near the San Felasco Hammock Preserve State Park.\n\nThe most prominent feature of State Park is the large sinkhole formed by the dissolution of limestone by acidic groundwater over long periods of time. Devil's Millhopper is unique in Florida in terms of its scale; over 100 feet of rock layers are exposed.\n\nThe cutaway, limestone sides of the sinkhole provide an easily visible geological record of the area. Twelve springs, some more visible than others, feed the pond at the bottom of the sinkhole. In the summer, the bottom of the sinkhole is dramatically cooler than the air at the surface due to the depth and shade from the canopy above. Significant fossil deposits include shark teeth, marine shells, and the fossilized remains of extinct land animals.\n\nEven though the park is only , three distinct ecological environments exist in the park, based on exposure to sun, fire, and water. In the sandhill environment, the sandy soil and regular fires result in pine trees being the predominant vegetation. The moist soils of the hammocks support broadleaf trees and more low vegetation, while the swamp areas only support flora and fauna adapted to year-around wet conditions.\n\nThe 120 foot (40 m) deep, 500 foot (150 m) wide sinkhole got its name from its similar appearance to the hopper of a mill, along with the bones found at the bottom, suggesting animals entered it on the way to meeting the devil. The Millhopper was owned for a time by the science department at the University of Florida and used as a research site for the students. Its unique ecosystem made it an invaluable resource for study. However, the Millhopper was often used by students as a place to socialize and have parties, which led to problems with litter and erosion from foot traffic.\n\nThe site was purchased by the state in 1974, and a set of 236 wooden steps, along with boardwalks and an observation deck at the bottom were completed in 1976 to allow access to the sink for visitors without further soil erosion.\n\nThe boardwalk was damaged by Hurricane Irma in September 2017, and closed to the public. The damaged boardwalk was replaced with a 132-step structure that ends higher in the sinkhole than the old one did. The path into the sinkhole reopened to the public on June 5, 2019.\n\nThe formation was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1974, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (in part for its surviving Civilian Conservation Corps infrastructure) in 2017.\n\n\n"}

He enjoyed a few years of popularity in London, where he challenged the dominance of Sir David Wilkie in the genre painting field, before moving on to history painting, specialising in battle scenes.\n\nBird was born in Wolverhampton, the son of a carpenter. He received no formal artistic training, but developed his skills through apprenticeship as a japanning artist painting tea trays. In 1794 he moved to Bristol, where he married Martha Dodrell and pursued a career in artistic commissions: portraiture, book illustrations, and church painting.\n\nAt Bristol, Bird became the centre of an informal group which included other artists such as Edward Villiers Rippingille and Nathan Cooper Branwhite, and which developed into the Bristol School. Initially amateur artists dominated the group, and Bird's closest friends included the amateurs John King, who was also Bird's doctor, and George Cumberland. Cumberland, who moved to Bristol in 1807, became godfather to Bird's son. He had a large art collection from which he would lend items for Bird to study.\n\nThe group conducted evening sketching meetings and sketching excursions to scenic locations around Bristol. \"Landscape with Cottage\" was probably painted on one of these trips. However, Bird painted landscapes relatively infrequently and he would often accompany the excursions without joining in the sketching. Bird's greatest influence on the Bristol artists was in the naturalistic style and fresh colours of his genre painting, especially so in the case of Rippingille, who worked closely with him. In 1814 they both exhibited works at the Royal Academy with the same subject, \"The Cheat Detected\". Francis Danby, who moved to Bristol from Ireland in 1813 and was to succeed Bird as a leader of the Bristol School, was also influenced by Bird's genre style.\n\nIn 1809, he exhibited at the Royal Academy \"Good News\", a genre portrait of an old soldier. Placed next to Wilkie's \"The Cut Finger\", it attracted attention, and Bird's popularity grew when the Prince Regent bought his \"The Country Choristers\" and commissioned \"Blind Man's Buff\". His works also include the \"Field of Chevy Chase\" and the \"Day after the Battle\", which was pronounced his masterpiece.\n\nBird was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1812, was appointed historical painter to Princess Charlotte in 1813, and elected a full member in 1815.\n\nPlagued by ill-health for over five years and unable to paint in the last year of his life, Bird died on 2 November 1819. He was buried in Bristol Cathedral. The following year a successful retrospective exhibition of his work was shown at the Bristol Fire Office, for the benefit of his family. His son George later became a midshipman, his equipment paid for by the subscriptions of Bird's friends. His daughter Martha became a Bristol watercolourist, and the younger daughter Harriet a governess.\n\n\n"}

Awards are made annually after plant trials intended to judge the plants' performance under UK growing conditions. Trials may last for one or more years, depending on the type of plant being analyzed, and may be performed at Royal Horticulture Society Garden in Wisley and other gardens or after observation of plants in specialist collections.

He started his career at Rangers, and was voted the SPFA Young Player of the Year in 1995 during his time with the club. After spells with English Premier League clubs Leicester City and Watford, Miller joined Dundee United in 2000 where he played for four seasons.\n\nMiller played for Norwegian club SK Brann from 2004 to 2006 and won the Norwegian Cup with the club in 2004. After spells in Belgium and Australia, he returned to Scotland in 2011 when he joined Clyde.\n\nMiller was born in Glasgow and raised in the Castlemilk district of the city; he was brought up by his mother and has never met his father. He attended Castlemilk High School before leaving early to join the staff at Rangers, having been on a youth contract with the club since the age of 11. He had been introduced to football by his two uncles, one of whom supported Rangers and the other Celtic; Miller has stated that he attended games of both clubs as a child and had no particular affection for either until he started to play regularly for Rangers' affiliated boys club.\n\nMiller made his senior debut in 1993 aged just 17, and showed he was talented enough to make an impression in the nine-in-a-row team under Walter Smith, winning three Scottish Premier Division titles between 1995 and 1997 (providing the cross for Brian Laudrup to score the championship-clinching goal in the latter), as well as lifting the Scottish League Cup in 1996 and starting matches in the UEFA Champions League against the likes of Juventus, Borussia Dortmund and Ajax, all by the age of 21. When David Beckham scored his famous goal from the halfway line against Wimbledon on 17 August 1996, he did so in boots custom-made for Miller (\"CHARLIE\" was embroidered on the boots), which had been given to Beckham by mistake.\n\nHowever, a lifestyle of parties and an unhealthy diet (with both his old Castlemilk pals and others such as teammate Paul Gascoigne's entourage) accompanied this early success, even after he made attempts to start afresh by moving with his partner to Rutherglen where their daughter was born in 1994, and his career appeared to be on the wane. In 1996, after playing in an Old Firm match earlier the same day, Miller engaged in a pub brawl after allegedly singing sectarian songs. His accomplice, Jimmy Gardner, was convicted of assault in relation to the incident, while a verdict of not proven was recorded against Miller.\n\nHaving fallen out of favour at Ibrox with the emerging Barry Ferguson being preferred in midfield, Miller was loaned to Leicester City towards the end of the 1998–99 season (having played enough matches for Rangers to receive a fourth league winner's medal) before joining Watford for £450,000 in October 1999. Watford were relegated in their first FA Premier League season with Miller unable to make an impact, making only 15 league appearances. He played one more League Cup game for the \"Hornets\" in the 2000-01 before moving to Dundee United on a free transfer.\n\nMiller enjoyed a successful four-year spell at Tannadice, becoming a firm favourite with the fans and making his international debut, but also losing two cup semi-finals to Celtic (2000–01 Scottish Cup and 2002–03 Scottish League Cup). Away from the pitch, an existing addiction to sports betting worsened, requiring him to attend Gamblers Anonymous meetings. In May 2004, a contract dispute saw Miller leave the club to join ex-United teammate Robbie Winters at Norwegian club SK Brann. He made 135 appearances for Dundee United in all competitions, which would be his highest total for a single club during his career.\n\nIn Bergen, Miller became one of the supporters' favourite players, due to his technique and passing ability. Despite this, he was in and out of the team, according to manager Mons Ivar Mjelde because of defensive considerations. He had early success with the club in the 2004 Norwegian Football Cup Final, a 4–1 win over Lyn, coming on as a late substitute for Winters who had scored one of the goals. He played regularly in 2005, although the club finished only mid-table, and in 2006 he started off as one of the league's top players, but gradually received some attention off the pitch, apparently provoked by lack of confidence from the manager. He made it clear that he was unhappy as a right midfielder, the position he had played in most of the season, and eventually that he wanted to leave the club. Miller also criticised Mjelde's unusually close ties to his rival for the attacking central midfield spot, Martin Andresen. Miller refused to participate in the silver medal ceremony after the game against Ham-Kam on 29 October, following which he was ignored by the coach, and only played the last minute of Brann's Royal League match against Rosenborg on 7 December 2006, in which he contributed to the winning goal scored by Trond Fredrik Ludvigsen.\n\nDuring his time at Brann he went on trial at English Championship club Cardiff City, but was not offered a full deal. In early January 2007, Miller began training with Scottish First Division club St Johnstone to top up his fitness during the Norwegian league's winter break. His contract with SK Brann was terminated after an agreement on 31 January.\n\nOn 9 February 2007, Miller signed a contract at the Belgian team Lierse S.K. On 20 April, he scored his first goals for Lierse against Germinal Beerschot in their (ultimately unsuccessful) fight to stay in the first division. On 27 June he signed a three-year contract with Lierse but was released less than a year later with the club having failed to gain promotion.\n\nOn 31 July 2008, Miller officially signed a two-year deal with Australian A-League club, Brisbane Roar. On 14 September, against Perth Glory, Miller broke the A-League scoring record for the best start to a season by scoring four goals in the Roar's opening four fixtures of the 2008-09 season.\n\nHe was diagnosed with a hernia and underwent surgery. Miller returned to the first team on 17 January 2009 as a substitute against Sydney FC coming on late in the game, and made the pass that set up Sergio van Dijk's third goal of the match. On 5 December 2009, Miller's contract with the Roar was terminated by mutual consent in the middle of the 2009–10 season as the club could not guarantee Miller a contract for the 2010–11 season.\n\nAfter leaving the Roar, Miller was linked with a move to Queensland rivals, North Queensland Fury FC and Gold Coast United. On 5 December 2009 he was a guest at a Gold Coast United fixture sparking rumors of a potential move. Miller signed with Gold Coast on a short-term injury replacement contract. While in Australia, he also had to declare himself bankrupt after an electronics business venture ran into difficulty.\n\nIt was reported on 12 November 2010 that Miller would spend the week training with Scottish Second Division club Ayr United. In February 2011, he signed for Clyde until the end of the season. He was released at the end of the season, after only making 5 appearances. After retiring from professional football, he began operating a youth football academy program in Castlemilk as well as playing in a local amateur team alongside Andy McLaren.\n\nMiller won his sole cap for Scotland in a 1–1 draw with Poland in 2001. Steven Caldwell, Kenny Miller, Barry Nicholson, Gavin Rae, John O'Neil and Andy McLaren (the latter a childhood friend of Miller from Castlemilk) also made their Scotland debuts in the same game. Scotland manager Craig Brown stated that 'Charlie Miller has always been a talented player and now I think his club manager Alex Smith has got the best out of him and this is a new challenge for him'. Brown resigned as Scotland boss later in 2001 after failing to qualify for the 2002 World Cup and Miller was overlooked by Brown's successor Berti Vogts. Scotland captain Barry Ferguson stated that Miller 'should be in the Scotland team', but Vogts did not take his advice.\n\n\"After 5 December 2009\"\n\n\n"}

It is a highly variable tree, and closely related to \"Cupressus goveniana,\" enough to sometimes be considered a subspecies of it.\n\nThe foliage is a dull dark to light green color, with scale-like leaves 1–1.5 mm long, with the leaf tips not spreading; seedlings bear needle-like leaves 8–10 mm long. The cones are small, 11–24 mm long, and almost spherical, with six or eight scales arranged in opposite decussate pairs, with the bract visible as no more than a small lump or short spine on the scale. The seeds are 3–5 mm long, with a pair of small wings along the sides. The cones remain closed on the trees for many years, until the trees are killed by a forest fire; after the tree is dead, the cones open to release the seeds which can then germinate successfully on the bare fire-cleared ground.\n\nThe Mendocino cypress differs little from \"C. goveniana\" in morphology, with the most conspicuous difference in herbarium material being the usually glossy black seeds, unlike the dull brown seeds of \"C. goveniana\", but even this character is not constant, with dull brown seeds found in the southernmost populations of \"C. pigmaea\" near Point Arena. Preliminary genetic studies have shown some differences, with notably some plastid sequences (\"matK\", \"rbcL\", and \"trnL\") suggesting a possible closer relationship to \"C. macrocarpa\", though other sequences confirm its close relationship to \"C. goveniana\". In cultivation together with \"C. goveniana\", it retains a very different crown shape, with a tall slender crown, contrasting with the broad, shrubby crown of \"C. goveniana\"; it also has darker green foliage (paler, yellow-green in \"C. goveniana\").\n\nThe largest recorded specimen is located in Mendocino County, with recorded dimensions of 43 m height, 2.13 m diameter, and 12 m crown spread, in 2000.\n\nIts taxonomic status is disputed by different authors. Some treat \"Cupressus pigmaea\" as a distinct species, following Sargent, including Wolf (1948), Griffin & Critchfield (1976), Lanner (1999), and Little \"et al.\" (2004), while others treat it within \"Cupressus goveniana\" as either a variety (\"C. goveniana var. pigmaea\" Lemmon) or a subspecies (\"C. goveniana subsp. pigmaea\" (Lemmon) A.Camus), including Camus (1914), and the \"Jepson Manual\" (1993), and yet others do not distinguish it at all within \"C. goveniana\", including the \"Flora of North America\" and Farjon (2005).\n\nThe scientific name is sometimes spelled \"pygmaea\", though this is an orthographic error.\n\nThe Mendocino cypress is highly variable in growth form, depending on soil conditions. In the pygmy forest plant community on poor, acidic, nutrient-starved podsol soils with drainage impeded by an iron hardpan, it is a stunted tree from 0.2–5 meters in height at maturity. When occurring in its pygmy form, it is sometimes called pygmy cypress. When growing on deep, well-drained soils it can be a large tree up to 30–50 meters in height and 1–2.4 m in trunk diameter. The bark is dark gray-brown, with stringy texture, and fissured on old trees.\n\nMendocino cypress occurs in very limited ranges within only Mendocino County, on some of the historical lands of the Yuki Native American people. In Mendocino County the occurrence is in a discontinuous coastal terrace strip, primarily as a pygmy forest associated with bishop pine (\"Pinus muricata\") and Mendocino shore pine (\"P. contorta var. bolanderi\"). Occurrences are typically below 500 m in elevation. The Mendocino County official soils survey states that \"While not formally recognized as a major forest cover type, the coastal portion of the survey area also includes bishop pine and Mendocino cypress (pygmy) forest types\".\n\nAlong the Mendocino coastal terraces, whose geological age is approximately one million years, studies have been conducted of the biomass density and primary productivity of the \"Cupressus pygmaea\"-dominated pygmy forest. The terraces in this area extend a full five to ten kilometers inland from the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn the Mendocino cypress pygmy forests, biomass was measured to range between 1.6 and 4.4 kilograms per square meter aboveground; moreover, net primary productivity was found to measure 180 to 360 grams per square meter per annum above the ground surface. Mean below-ground values are 3.5 kilograms biomass per square meter, productivity being 402 grams per meter per annum. The leaf-area ratio of the pygmy forest was estimated as 2.1 grams per square meter implying a high production efficiency per unit leaf area for an evergreen community (150 grams per meter aboveground ). According to Westman, productivity of the \"C. pygmaea\" forest lies within the range expected for open, dry woodlands. A similar community for which data is available is a pygmy conifer-oak scrubland in southern Arizona.\n"}

It was reprinted in the short-story collection \"El Aleph\" in 1949.\n\nThe story takes the form of a monologue by Asterion. He begins by suggesting that certain defamatory claims—that he is arrogant, or misanthropic, or mad—are untrue. Asterion describes his house in detail: that it has no locked doors; that it has many corridors and rooms, pools and courtyards. He explains his hermetic ways by recounting how once, when he left his house, the commoners were so agitated that he now does not go out, believing that his royal blood sets him apart (after all, he is the child of a queen). Asterion explains how he spends his days in solitude: running through the corridors; pretending to sleep; and sometimes pretending that \"the other Asterion\" has come to visit, and giving him a tour of the house.\n\nAsterion goes into detail about the infinitude of his house, comparing it to the universe. He also suggests that perhaps he created the world and has forgotten about it. Finally he makes mention of other people, nine men, who come every nine years \"so that I may deliver them from evil\", and whose bodies he leaves in the empty rooms to distinguish one from another. Asterion speculates about his own death, and eagerly awaits the coming of his \"redeemer\", who will take him away from his infinite house.\n\nThe story ends with a line from Theseus—\"Would you believe it, Ariadne? The Minotaur scarcely defended himself.\"—revealing with those words to the reader that Asterion is indeed the Cretan Minotaur.\n\nAs in many of his stories, Borges looks at a popular story through a different lens, shedding light on other possible interpretations of the events. In the vein of Edgar Allan Poe he starts with the monologue of a socially unusual character and at the end adds an unexpected twist to the story.\n\n"}

It is activated by the steroid hormone progesterone.\n\nIn humans, PR is encoded by a single \"PGR\" gene residing on chromosome 11q22, it has two isoforms, PR-A and PR-B, that differ in their molecular weight. The PR-B is the positive regulator of the effects of progesterone, while PR-A serve to antagonize the effects of PR-B.\n\nProgesterone is necessary to induce the progesterone receptors. When no binding hormone is present the carboxyl terminal inhibits transcription. Binding to a hormone induces a structural change that removes the inhibitory action. Progesterone antagonists prevent the structural reconfiguration.\n\nAfter progesterone binds to the receptor, restructuring with dimerization follows and the complex enters the nucleus and binds to DNA. There transcription takes place, resulting in formation of messenger RNA that is translated by ribosomes to produce specific proteins.\n\nIn common with other steroid receptors, the progesterone receptor has a N-terminal regulatory domain, a DNA binding domain, a hinge section, and a C-terminal ligand binding domain. A special transcription activation function (TAF), called TAF-3, is present in the progesterone receptor-B, in a B-upstream segment (BUS) at the amino acid terminal. This segment is not present in the receptor-A.\n\nAs demonstrated in progesterone receptor-deficient mice, the physiological effects of progesterone depend completely on the presence of the human progesterone receptor (hPR), a member of the steroid-receptor superfamily of nuclear receptors. The single-copy human (hPR) gene uses separate promoters and translational start sites to produce two isoforms, hPR-A and -B, which are identical except for an additional 165 amino acids present only in the N terminus of hPR-B. Although hPR-B shares many important structural domains with hPR-A, they are in fact two functionally distinct transcription factors, mediating their own response genes and physiological effects with little overlap. Selective ablation of PR-A in a mouse model, resulting in exclusive production of PR-B, unexpectedly revealed that PR-B contributes to, rather than inhibits, epithelial cell proliferation both in response to estrogen alone and in the presence of progesterone and estrogen. These results suggest that in the uterus, the PR-A isoform is necessary to oppose estrogen-induced proliferation as well as PR-B-dependent proliferation.\n\nSix variable sites, including four polymorphisms and five common haplotypes have been identified in the human PR gene . One promoter region polymorphism, +331G/A, creates a unique transcription start site. Biochemical assays showed that the +331G/A polymorphism increases transcription of the PR gene, favoring production of hPR-B in an Ishikawa endometrial cancer cell line.\n\nSeveral studies have now shown no association between progesterone receptor gene +331G/A polymorphisms and breast or endometrial cancers. However, these follow-up studies lacked the sample size and statistical power to make any definitive conclusions, due to the rarity of the +331A SNP. It is currently unknown which if any polymorphisms in this receptor are of significance to cancer.\n\nKnockout mice of the PR have been found to have severely impaired lobuloalveolar development of the mammary glands as well as delayed but otherwise normal mammary ductal development at puberty.\n\nDuring rodent perinatal life, progesterone receptor (PR) is known to be transiently expressed in both the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway. PR activity during this time period impacts the development of dopaminergic innervation of the mPFC from the VTA. If PR activity is altered, a change in dopaminergic innervation of the mPFC is seen and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis, in the VTA will also be impacted. TH expression in this area is an indicator of dopaminergic activity, which is believed to be involved in normal and critical development of complex cognitive behaviors that are mediated by the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway, such as working memory, attention, behavioral inhibition, and cognitive flexibility.\n\nResearch has shown that when a PR antagonist, such as RU 486, is administered to rats during the neonatal period, decreased tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (TH-ir) cells density, a strong co-expresser with PR-immunoreactivity (PR-ir), is seen in the mPFC of juvenile rodents. Later on, in adulthood, decreased levels of TH-ir in the VTA are also shown. This alteration in TH-ir fiber expression, an indicator of altered dopaminergic activity resulting from neonatal PR antagonist administration, has been shown to impair later performance on tasks that measure behavioral inhibition and impulsivity, as well as cognitive flexibility in adulthood. Similar cognitive flexibility impairments were also seen in PR knockout mice as a result of reduced dopaminergic activity in the VTA.\n\nConversely, when a PR agonist, such as 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, is administered to rodents during perinatal life, as the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway is developing, dopaminergic innervation of the mPFC increases. As a result, TH-ir fiber density also increases. Interestingly, this increase in TH-ir fibers and dopaminergic activity is also linked to impaired cognitive flexibility with increased perseveration later on in life.\n\nIn combination, these findings suggest that PR expression during early development impact later cognitive functioning in rodents. Furthermore, it appears as though abnormal levels of PR activity during this critical period of mesocortical dopaminergic pathway development may have profound effects on specific behavioral neural circuits involved in the formation of later complex cognitive behavior.\n\n\n\n\nProgesterone receptor has been shown to interact with:\n\n\n"}

The collection represents a major primary source for the political, religious, military, and social history of England during the final years of the reign of King Charles I, the English Civil War, the Interregnum, and the English Restoration of King Charles II. It is now held in the British Library.\n\nBookseller and publisher George Thomason (died 1666), who maintained a shop in the churchyard of St. Paul's Cathedral in London, methodically collected and preserved the works over two decades. The tracts consist of a broad range of writings, including sermons, songs, political speeches, debates, opinions, jokes, gossip, news reports, descriptions of the trial and execution of Charles I, accounts of Civil War battles, reports from Parliament, and several regularly appearing publications that historians consider the forebears of modern newspapers. Thomason's collection represents approximately 80 percent of the published works released in England during this period.\n\nThomason frequently made handwritten annotations on the tracts, providing such information as publication dates and the authorship of anonymous works. During the turbulent years of the Civil War and the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell Thomason reputedly moved the collection several times to protect the more controversial works from destruction by government or opposition censors.\n\nThomason appears to have entrusted the collection to the care of Thomas Barlow, provost of The Queen's College and former librarian of the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford, and a future Bishop of Lincoln. Between 1660 and 1664 Barlow offered the tracts, together with two copies of a manuscript catalogue to the university for £4,000 but the sale was not agreed. Thomason remained hopeful that they would be sold, and in his will dated 1664, he charged his three executors (Barlow, Thomas Lockey, and John Rushworth) with selling the collection to the University on behalf of his children.\n\nAfter Thomason's death in April 1666, the negotiations fell through and the collection remained in Barlow's hands, until they were acquired about 1677–1679 by the bookbinder Samuel Mearne on behalf of the Royal Library at the Palace of Whitehall. Mearne rebound the tract volumes in a uniform manner but was never paid for his work and so retained the collection. Eventually Mearne's widow sought and obtained the permission of the Privy Council in May 1684 to dispose of them on her family's behalf. Over the next four decades various members of the Sisson family (descendants of Samuel Mearne) endeavoured to sell the collection on numerous occasions to Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, the Bodleian Library, Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth, James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos, Frederick, Prince of Wales, the Radcliffe Library in Oxford and the antiquary and book collector \"Honest Tom\" Martin, but in each case the potential purchasers were put off by the high price asked.\n\nIn January 1754 Elizabeth Sisson approached Thomas Birch one of the trustees of the newly established British Museum, loaning him the 12 volume catalogue, but again nothing was to come of the sale during Elizabeth Sisson's lifetime. Finally, in 1762, John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute purchased the collection on behalf of King George III for the bargain price of £300 (a fraction of the cost of forming the collection). In that same year King George III donated the collection to the new British Museum at Montagu House, where they were originally known as the \"King's pamphlets\" and added to the Royal Library Collection. In 1973, the museum transferred the Thomason Tracts to the British Library where they continue to be housed.\n\nAccording to Thomas Carlyle, the Thomason Tracts were;\nMany of the publications that comprise the collection are exceedingly rare. In fact, some are not known to exist anywhere else. The tracts are bound into some 2,000 volumes and housed at the British Library's main building at St. Pancras. Because of their rarity and fragile condition, the originals are not available to general researchers. However, the library maintains paper facsimiles in its rare books collection, and in 1977 University Microfilms International released a set of 256 microfilm reels containing the entire collection. The microfilms are available at research libraries around the world.\n\n\n"}

He was capped 18 times by Scotland, scoring two goals.\n\nHe spent a large portion of his career at Aberdeen over two spells, and is ranked 11th on the club's all-time appearances list; he has been described as \"arguably the club's last great player\".\n\nBorn in the village of Portsoy in Aberdeenshire, Jess began his career in Glasgow as a trainee striker at Rangers (alongside future Scotland teammate John Spencer) but was allowed to leave in 1987; he soon moved back to his home region, signing for Aberdeen. Having made his debut at the end of the 1988–89 season, 18-year-old Jess made an impact in the first team from the outset of the following campaign, starting against Rapid Vienna in the UEFA Cup and against Rangers in the 1989 Scottish League Cup Final at Hampden Park, which Aberdeen won 2–1. The club finished runners-up in the Premier Division, and Jess picked up another winner's medal as an unused substitute in the 1990 Scottish Cup Final.\n\nIn 1990–91 he scored 13 league goals and linked up with Hans Gillhaus to great effect as Aberdeen missed out on the title on the final day. The strikes including a hat-trick away to Dundee United, four away to Dunfermline and three across two home wins over Celtic. He won the \"PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year\" award for the season. Although Jess played 42 games in 1991–92, the season was a disappointment as Aberdeen finished only 6th in the league. He scored in a September victory over Rangers at Ibrox Stadium which proved to be Aberdeen's last win at that venue until 2017.\n\n1992–93 brought an improvement as the club were league runners-up and reached both cup finals. Jess scored the winning goal in the semi-final of the 1992–93 Scottish League Cup against Celtic and played all 120 minutes of the final which ended in a 2–1 defeat to Rangers. In March 1993 he suffered a fractured ankle in the quarter-final of the 1992-93 Scottish Cup against Clydebank but was rushed back to fitness after only two months out and appeared as a substitute in the final of the competition, which Aberdeen again lost 2–1 to Rangers. Despite failing to win any trophies and missing part of the season with his injury, he won the PFA Young Player award for a second time.\n\nIn 1993–94 Jess helped Aberdeen to another second-place finish in the Premier Division. He also scored five goals in four matches in the Cup Winners' Cup, finishing joint-top scorer in the competition. The next season almost ended in relegation for the club and Jess started only 15 league games due to a persistent foot injury. He returned as a regular starter in 1995–96 playing in a more withdrawn central midfield role to accommodate strikers Dodds, Booth and Shearer. He produced an impressive performance in the semi-final of the League Cup as Aberdeen overcame Rangers, scored a long-range goal in a league game against the same opponents a few weeks later and was in the team which won the 1995 Scottish League Cup Final, beating Dundee.\n\nFollowing this victory, he decided to seek a new challenge in his career and requested a move with his contract due to expire. As he had impressed in Europe against Italian opposition (Torino), Serie A clubs showed an interest and Jess has stated that Sampdoria were keen to sign him under the Bosman ruling at the end of the season, but he was determined that Aberdeen should receive a transfer fee, therefore agreed to a £2 million transfer to Coventry City of the English Premier League in February 1996. He left Aberdeen for the first time having made 253 official appearances for the club, scoring 63 goals, and the transfer fee they received for him was a record amount.\n\n25-year-old Jess made his Coventry debut against Middlesbrough on 24 February 1996 and made 12 league appearances in the latter part of that season under manager Ron Atkinson, scoring what would prove to be his only league goal for the club against QPR. In 1996–97 he played 27 times in the league but only started 19 of those, and scored an own goal in a game against Manchester United. He scored twice in Coventry's run in the 1996–97 FA Cup, netting in the third round game against Woking, and again in the fourth round victory at Blackburn Rovers. By that time Gordon Strachan had taken over from Atkinson as manager, and in the close season he allowed Jess to leave as he could not guarantee his place in the team. Despite his stay at Highfield Road being fairly brief, he later described the experience as \"fantastic\" due to the excitement of the games fighting relegation.\n\nIn summer 1997 Jess returned to Aberdeen, rejoining Roy Aitken's side for a fee of £700,000. This spell at Pittodrie was shorter and less successful than his first, although he did manage a career-best total of 14 league goals in 1998–99 including on the opening day which was the first goal of the Scottish Premier League era. He also played in the 2000 Scottish League Cup Final and 2000 Scottish Cup Final, both of which ended in defeat.\n\nHaving been a regular starter since his return he played less frequently in his final season, 2000–01, under manager Ebbe Skovdahl. In December 2000 he stated publicly that he may not sign a new contract and suggested that Aberdeen's ambition did not match his own (unaware of the club's financial plight at the time), alienating him from the hierarchy; he soon departed for a second time upon the opening of the winter transfer window, having made a further 126 Aberdeen appearances (31 goals).\n\nJess returned to the Premier League at the age of 30 with Bradford City, initially on loan, and scored on his debut for the \"Bantams\" on 1 January 2001 against Leicester City. Bradford were relegated in last place but the loan move was a success (17 games, 3 goals), with the deal being made permanent in the summer when Jess's Aberdeen contract expired. In the 2001–02 First Division he made 45 league appearances and finished the season as top scorer with 14 goals (including a hat-trick in a home win over Watford), but financial problems meant he was released by Bradford in June 2002 following the collapse of ITV Digital.\n\nHe joined Nottingham Forest in August 2002 and in his first season steered Forest into the play-offs in 6th place. However they dropped to 14th the next year and were relegated in 2005, and Jess moved on as a free agent.\n\nIn July 2005 he signed for Northampton Town and in his first season with the club achieved promotion from the fourth tier; in April 2007 he was released from his contract with \"The Cobblers\", aged 36, and retired from playing.\n\nHaving previously been selected for the Under-21 side, and after declining an approach from Northern Ireland (his father's birthplace), Jess made his debut for Scotland in November 1992 against Italy. He went on to earn 18 full caps. As an intermittent member of the main squad, he also appeared twice for the B team in 1994 and 1996.\n\nWhilst at Coventry City he was selected for UEFA Euro 1996, and made one appearance during the tournament as a substitute in the 0–2 defeat to England. His two international goals were both scored while playing for Aberdeen, although four years apart: the first came against San Marino in 1995, and the second in a 1–2 UEFA Euro 2000 qualifier defeat at home to the Czech Republic in March 1999; he appeared from the bench in the return fixture three months later, which proved to be his final Scotland match.\n\nHe later rejoined Nottingham Forest as a coach for their youth team from 2007 until he left the post in May 2012. He also spent time on the coaching staff at Peterborough United, joining in August 2012 to work under Darren Ferguson as a replacement for Mark Robson but departing less than a year later, replaced by Gary Breen (coincidentally, once a teammate at Coventry for a short period).\n\nIn April 2009, at the age of 38, Jess suffered a mild stroke. During further tests it was discovered that a hole had been present in his heart all his life (heart scans were not part of the medical examination during his transfers, and may have jeopardised his career had they been) and in 2010 he underwent surgery to correct this.\n\nIn 2015 Jess was voted into Aberdeen's 'greatest ever team' by supporters of the club. In November 2018, he was one of four inductees into the Aberdeen \"Hall of Fame\".\n\nIn 2016 he was living in Barcelona.\n\n"}

In high doses, pentobarbital causes death by respiratory arrest. In the United States, the drug has been used for executions of convicted criminals. Lundbeck (one of many manufacturers) does not permit its sale to prisons or corrections departments to carry out the death penalty. Abbott Pharmaceuticals' brand of pentobarbital, Nembutal, which was available in 50 and 100 mg yellow capsules, was discontinued in 1999. Prescribed for insomnia, it has been largely replaced by the benzodiazepine family of drugs. Nembutal was widely abused and known on the streets as \"yellow jackets\" due to their yellow capsule. Pentobarbital in pill form is no longer available. The death of Marilyn Monroe in 1962 was ruled as probable suicide due to an overdose of Nembutal. Kenneth Halliwell's death is also attributed to an overdose of Nembutal.\n\nTypical applications for pentobarbital are sedative, hypnotic for short term, preanesthetic, insomnia, and control of convulsions in emergencies. Abbott Pharmaceutical discontinued manufacture of their Nembutal brand of Pentobarbital capsules in 1999, largely replaced by the Benzodiazepine family of drugs. Pentobarbital was also widely abused, known on the streets as \"yellow jackets\". They were available in 50 and 100 mg. yellow capsules. Pentobarbital in pill form is no longer manufactured.\n\nIt is also used as a veterinary anesthetic agent.\n\nPentobarbital also has an application in reducing intracranial pressure in Reye's syndrome, traumatic brain injury and induction of coma in cerebral ischemia patients. Pentobarbital-induced coma has been advocated in patients with acute liver failure refractory to mannitol.\n\nPentobarbital can cause death when used in high doses. It is used for euthanasia for humans as well as animals. It is also used by itself, or in combination with complementary agents such as phenytoin, in commercial animal euthanasia injectable solutions.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the standard protocol for physician-assisted suicide is to provide 9 grams of pentobarbital sodium along with sugar syrup in a 20% ethanol solution for self-administration by the patient.\n\nThe oral dosage of pentobarbital indicated for physician-assisted death in the United States states of Oregon, Washington, Vermont, and California (as of January, 2016) is typically 10 g in liquid form. This is considerably higher than the dose for the management of status epilepticus.\n\nPentobarbital has been used or considered as a substitute for other drugs traditionally used for capital punishment in the United States when they are in short supply. Such use however is illegal under Danish law, and when this was discovered, after public outcry in Danish media, Lundbeck, the owner of the drug, stopped selling it to US states that impose the death penalty. US distributors of the drug are forbidden by the owner to sell it to any customers, such as several state authorities, that practice or participate in executions of humans.\n\nTexas began using pentobarbital for executing death-row inmates by lethal injection on July 18, 2012. The use of pentobarbital has been considered by several states, including Ohio, Arizona, Idaho, and Washington; those states made the decision to switch following shortages of pancuronium bromide, a muscle paralytic previously used as one component in a three-drug cocktail.\n\nIn October 2013, Missouri changed its protocols to allow for a compounded pentobarbital to be used in a lethal dose for executions and it was first used in November 2013.\n\nOn July 25, 2019, US Attorney General William Barr directed the federal government to resume capital punishment after 16 years. The drug of choice for these executions is pentobarbital.\n\nPentobarbital undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver and possibly the intestines.\n\nAdministration of ethanol, benzodiazepines, opioids, antihistamines, other sedative-hypnotics, and other central nervous system depressants will cause possible additive effects.\n\nPentobarbital is synthesized by methods analogous to that of amobarbital, the only difference being that the alkylation of α-ethylmalonic ester is carried out with 2-bromopentane in place of 1-bromo-3-methylbutane to give pentobarbital.\n\nPentobarbital is the INN, AAN, BAN, and USAN while pentobarbitone is a former AAN and BAN.\n\nOne brand name for this drug is Nembutal, coined by John S. Lundy, who started using it in 1930, from the structural formula of the sodium salt—Na (sodium) + ethyl + methyl + butyl + al (common suffix for barbiturates). Nembutal is trademarked and manufactured by the Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck (now produced by Akorn Pharmaceuticals) and is the only injectable form of pentobarbital approved for sale in the United States.

They were highly influenced by this particular sound early on. The original line-up also included Patrick Francis, and Lenny Vartanian. In 1995, the bass guitarist Francis and the drummer Vartanian were replaced by Frank Salvaggio and Robert Urbani respectively, beginning a new, heavier metal direction for the band.\n\nAt that time, the Canadian music scene had yet to embrace nu/alternative metal music, so Salvaggio and Urbani decided to make a six-day trip by Greyhound bus from Montreal to Los Angeles, the center of alternative metal, to begin the process of making in-roads, contacts and securing showcases for the band. After a year filled with showcases the band secured a record deal through Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne's Divine Recordings which released their full-length album, \"Inches from the Mainline\", in 2000.\n\nThe band also toured Ozzfest in 2000, and made an appearance on the SnoCore Tour. The album sold approximately 70,000 copies in the US.\n\nAfter Divine Recordings lost their distribution deal with EMI's Priority Records, the band was left without a label and returned to Montreal. Salvaggio once again returned to Los Angeles with the goal of securing another record deal. With the help of producers Jason Slater and Troy Van Leeuwen, a contract was signed with Bieler Bros. Records. Their second major album, \"Metafour\", was released in 2003.\n\nIn March 2004, Rockman, the vocalist, left the band, prompting Slaves on Dope to disband. Salvaggio and Urbani are now part of the band Anew Revolution, with the ex-Ünloco vocalist Joey Duenas. Jardine has become a producer in Montreal (Uplift Recording Studio), as well as forming his own band called The Monarchy (Disbanded).\n\nIn 2006, the band's independent release \"One Good Turn Deserves Another\" was re-issued through Just A Minute Records. In 2009, Rockman and Jardine reformed Slaves on Dope and the group subsequently recorded their fourth studio album. In an online webisode, the band announced the name of the album to be \"Over the Influence\". It was announced on webisode 18 that the recording had finished with 17 tracks. Rockman then said in a video on the band's Facebook page that the album would be released in spring 2011.\n\nIn October 2011, it was announced that Slaves on Dope had signed to /Rocket Science Ventures, the new label of the Corporate Punishment Records President, and early Slaves on Dope manager Thom Hazaert, who would release \"Over the Influence\" worldwide in spring 2012. They also announced the release of a digital-only EP, \"Careless Coma\", in November 2011.\n\nSlaves On Dope released their fifth studio album [HORSE] on September 9, 2016. It features DMC, Bill Kelliher, HR from Bad Brains and Lee Baum from The Damn Truth and their new bass player Rob Laurion.\n\nOne of the band's main influences is the San Francisco group Faith No More, whom vocalist Jason Rockman labelled as \"our heroes\". He stated \"They were always our benchmark. They were always the band that inspired us. They just did what they wanted to do and they didn’t give a flying fuck what people thought. That’s how we are.\" Regarding the band's association with the nu metal genre, Rockman reflected \"You know, we’ve always been a band that has been hard to lump in with anything. A lot of people said, ‘you guys were a nu-metal band.’ Well, no we were not a nu-metal band. We were just Slaves on Dope and doing what we do. You know, when I was screaming and singing I did it because I heard Burton from Fear Factory doing it and I thought it was cool. But then suddenly it became screamo and emo and metalcore and all these other genres that came after the 2000s, and we just never fit in. And we still don’t fit in.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2246590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246590", "title": "Specification and Description Language", "text": "Specification and Description Language\n\nSpecification and Description Language (SDL) is a specification language targeted at the unambiguous specification and description of the behaviour of reactive and distributed systems.\n\nThe ITU-T has defined SDL in Recommendations Z.100 to Z.106. SDL originally focused on telecommunication systems; its current areas of application include process control and real-time applications in general. Due to its nature it can be used to represent simulation systems without ambiguity and with a graphical notation.\n\nThe Specification and Description Language provides both a graphical \"Graphic Representation\" (SDL/GR) as well as a textual \"Phrase Representation\" (SDL/PR), which are both equivalent representations of the same underlying semantics. Models are usually shown in the graphical SDL/GR form, and SDL/PR is mainly used for exchanging models between tools. A system is specified as a set of interconnected abstract machines which are extensions of finite state machines (FSM).\n\nThe language is formally complete,\nso it can be used for code generation for either simulation or final targets.\n\nThe Specification and Description Language covers five main aspects: structure, communication, behavior, data, and inheritance. The behavior of components is explained by partitioning the system into a series of hierarchies. Communication between the components takes place through gates connected by channels. The channels are of delayed channel type, so communication is usually asynchronous, but when the delay is set to zero (that is, no delay) the communication becomes synchronous.\n\nThe first version of the language was released in 1976 using graphical syntax (SDL-76). This was revised in 1980 with some rudimentary semantics (SDL-80). The semantics were refined in 1984 (SDL-84), the textual form was introduced for machine processing and data was introduced. In 1988, SDL-88 was released with a formal basis for the language: an abstract grammar as well as a concrete grammar and a full formal definition. The version released in 1992 (SDL-92) introduced object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, abstract generic types etc., with the object-oriented features described by transformations into non-object oriented ones. SDL-2010 is the latest version, an updated version of SDL-2000 that was completely based on object-orientation, rather than description by transformations. This version is accompanied by a UML-Profile: ITU-T Recommendation Z.109 (04/12), SDL-2010 combined with UML. SDL-2010 also introduced the support of C data types as initially introduced by SDL-RT.\n\nThe Hierarchy level of SDL is structured as follows. \n\nAn SDL system is made of functional blocks and each block can be further decomposed in sub-blocks. The lowest level block is composed of one or several process described as finite state machines.\n\nBlocks are connected through channels that carry the messages (or signals) exchanged between the blocks. A block agent consists of process agents.\n\nEach process agent is a state machine that contributes to the action carried out by the system. A message stimulus coming from the environment or from another agent to an agent is called a signal. Signals received by a process agent are first placed in a queue (the input port). When the state machine is waiting in a state, if the first signal in the input port is enabled for that state it starts a transition leading to another state. Transitions can output signals to other agents or to the environment. A process agent is allowed to contain procedure types so that the same actions can be invoked from different places. It is also allowed to call a remote procedure type to invoke a procedure in another agent (or even another system) and wait for a response.\n\nIn this example MyVariable is of type INTEGER and is the only variable in the process. The first transition is the \"start\" transition that initializes the local variable. A connection request message \"conReq\" is sent, a 5 seconds timer \"conReqTimer\" is started, and the state machine goes to the \"connecting\" state. In the \"connecting\" state if the timer goes off -that is equivalent to a message receive- the connection request is sent again up to 10 times. If a connection confirmation is received the state machine goes to \"connected\" state. This is a typical telecommunication protocol scenario.\n\nAvailable symbols are:\n\nSDL Abstract Data Types (ADT) support basic data types such as INTEGER, REAL, CHARSTRING as well as structured ones such as structures (STRUCT), enumerated (LITERALS), constants (SYNONYMS). Syntax looks like the one from Pascal, for example an assignment is written ':='.\n\nThe most well-known SDL modelling tools are Telelogic Tau, PragmaDev Studio, Cinderella, Safire-SDL, and ObjectGeode (now out of the market). PragmaDev Studio supports both SDL and SDL-RT which is used to develop real-time and embedded software. There are also some open source projects relative to SDL modeling like JADE which is a Java-based specification environment, and OpenGEODE, a Python/Qt implementation of an SDL editor from the European Space Agency.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He probably visited North America in 1686, reaching Boston aboard the frigate HMS \"Dartmouth\".\n\nWalker was promoted to captain about 1692 and saw action near the Lizard while in command of the fourth-rate HMS \"Foresight\" in around 1696. In 1701 he joined the fleet under Sir George Rooke at Cadiz, and shortly afterwards, as commodore, took command of a detachment charged with cooperating in an attack on Guadeloupe and Martinique, which was unsuccessful. This failure did not damage his career, though; in 1706 he assisted in the relief of Barcelona, and two years later was appointed to command the squadron before Dunkirk. In March 1711 he was promoted to rear-admiral and was also given a knighthood.\n\nOn April 3, 1711, the new rear-admiral of the white squadron was made commander-in-chief of a secret naval expedition aimed at the conquest of New France. His expedition was to attack Quebec in combination with a land expedition led by Colonel Francis Nicholson.\n\nOn July 30, the expedition consisting of nine ships of war, two bomb vessels and 60 transports and tenders, British and colonial, with some 7,500 troops and marines aboard set sail from Boston. On the morning of the 18th of August, just as the expedition was about to enter the Saint Lawrence River, the wind began to blow hard from the northwest, and Walker was forced to seek shelter in Gaspé Bay. On the morning of the 20th, the wind veered to the southeast, and he was able to advance slowly past the western extremity of Anticosti Island before it died down and thick fog blanketed both shore and fleet. By the 22nd, the wind had freshened from the southeast, and there were intermittent breaks in the fog, but not sufficient to give sight of land. After consulting his pilots, Walker gave the signal to head the fleet southward.\n\nWalker had thought he was in mid-stream when he issued the order. In fact, he was about seven leagues north of his proper course, and in the grasp of strong currents which steered his ships towards the northwest. Aided by an easterly wind, the fleet was gradually closing on the \"North Shore,\" which in the vicinity of Île-aux-Oeufs (Egg Island) runs almost north and south. When a captain reported that land had been sighted, presumably dead ahead, Walker assumed that he was approaching the south shore, and ordered the fleet to wear, and bring-to on the other tack. Not many minutes later he was again summoned from his bed, and hurrying upon deck in dressing gown and slippers saw breakers \"all round us.\" By that time the whole fleet was heading for the \"North Shore,\" or more accurately, the coast to the westward; ships in the van were already plunging on the edge of the breakers.\n\nOnce recovered from the shock, Walker made all available sail, and stood from the shore towards mid-channel. Up to this time a gale had been blowing almost directly on shore, and had it continued it is doubtful if many of the fleet could have survived. However, in the early morning of the next day, the wind dropped, and this lull was followed by a shift of wind which enabled most of the ships to slip their anchors and escape the shoals on either quarter. Altogether, seven transports and one storeship were lost. Out of a total of 1,390, 740 soldiers (including 35 women attached to the regiments) and probably 150 sailors were either drowned or died from exposure on shore. Walker cruised in the neighbourhood of Île-aux-Oeufs for two days in an effort to save what men and stores he could. Then, following a council of war, he decided to abandon the assault on Quebec.\n\nWalker returned to London in October 1711, where he was not censured for his conduct in the expedition. In 1712 he was appointed commodore of the Jamaica Station. He returned a year later to England. Walker's journal, recounting the events of 1711, was published in 1720 and was edited by Gerald S. Graham and re-published jointly by the Champlain Society and the Navy Records Society in 1953.\n\n"}

It declared its autocephaly in 1922 through its Congress of 1922, and gained recognition from the Patriarch of Constantinople in 1937.\n\nThe church suffered during the Second World War, and in the communist period that followed, especially after 1967 when Albania was declared an atheist state, and no public or private expression of religion was allowed.\n\nThe church has, however, seen a revival since religious freedom was restored in 1991, with more than 250 churches rebuilt or restored, and more than 100 clergy being ordained. It has 909 parishes spread all around Albania, and around 500,000 to 550,000 (unconfirmed) faithful. The number is claimed to be as high as 700,000 by some Orthodox sources – and higher when considering the Albanian diaspora.\n\nEcclesiastically, Christians in Albania, as part of the province of Illyricum, were under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome (1st-8th century). From 732-733 AD the ecclesiatical jurisdiction of Illyricum was transferred to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Great Schism of 1054 formalized the split of Christianity into two branches, Catholicism and Orthodoxy, which was reflected in Albania through the emergence of a Catholic north and Orthodox south. During the moment of schism, 1054, Albanians were attached to the Eastern Orthodox Church and were all Orthodox Christians.\n\nThe official recognition of the Eastern Orthodox Church by the Porte resulted in the Orthodox population being tolerated until the late 18th century. The Orthodox population of Albania was integrated into the Patriarchate of Constantinople, with the population of central and south-eastern Albania being under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid, and the population of south-western Albania being under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Metropolis of Ioannina.\n\nDuring the late eighteenth century, the poverty of the Orthodox Church, the illiterate clergy, a lack of clergy in some areas, liturgy in a language other than Albanian and the reliance of the bishoprics of Durrës and southern Albania upon the declining Archbishopric of Ohrid, due in part to simony, weakened the faith among the Church's adherents and reduced the ability for Orthodox Albanians to resist conversion to Islam.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, due to the Tanzimat reforms which imposed mandatory military service on non-Muslims, the Orthodox Church lost adherents as the majority of Albanians became Muslim.\n\nIn the 19th century, Orthodox Albanians under the Patriarchate of Constantinople had liturgy and schooling in Greek, which was also the lingua franca in the South, and in the late Ottoman period their political thinking was divided: although most Orthodox Christians wished for the end of Ottoman rule, some of them - especially the upper class - desired to be part of a Greek state, some sought Greek-Albanian cooperation and a Greek-Albanian federation state or dual monarchy, and some who sought Albanian statehood. For Orthodox Albanians, \"Albanianism\" was closely associated with Hellenism, linked through the faith of Orthodoxy, however during the Eastern crisis this premise was rejected by some Albanian Orthodox because of the growing competition between the Albanian and Greek national movements over parts of Epirus. These issues also generated a reaction against Greek nationalists that drove the Albanian desire to stress a separate cultural identity. \n\nThe religious division among Albanians meant that Albanian nationalism could not be based on religion and instead Albanian nationalism as it developed tended to promote interreligious cooperation, from the point of its inception in the writings of Naum Veqilharxhi. Although the Orthodox were a minority among Albanians, the Albanian nationalist movement began among the Orthodox, and subsequently spread to other religious communities among Albanians. Orthodox Albanians especially in the diaspora and from Korçë and its nearby regions began to affiliate with the movement by working together with Muslim Albanians regarding shared socio-geopolitical Albanian interests and aims, causing concerns for Greece because it threatened the aspirations to incorporate Epirus into Greece, and because those Greeks who sought an Albanian-Greek confederation took a negative view of other foreign influences among Albanians. Although Greek schools were for awhile the only way Orthodox children could become educated and at Greek schools children where they were exposed to Greek nationalism, Orthodox Albanians would instead come to play an active and often leading role in the Albanian national independence movement, often at great cost to themselves and their families.\n\nAt the onset of the twentieth century, the idea to create an \"Albanian Orthodoxy\" or an Albanian expression of Orthodoxy emerged in the diaspora at a time when the Orthodox were increasingly being assimilated by the Patriarchate and Greece through the sphere of politics. As Orthodoxy was associated with the Greek identity, the rise of the movement caused confusion for Orthodox Albanians as it interrupted the formation of a Greek national consciousness. The Orthodox Albanian community had individuals such as Jani Vreto, Spiro Dine and Fan Noli involved in the national movement, of which some advocated for an Albanian Orthodoxy in order to curtail the Hellenisation process occurring amongst Orthodox Albanians. In 1905, priest Kristo Negovani introduced Albanian liturgy for Orthodox worship in his native Negovan for the first time, for which he was murdered by Greek \"andartes\" on behalf from Bishop Karavangelis of Kastoria, leading to the retaliatory murder the Metropolitan of Korçë, Photios, who opposed the Albanian national movement. In 1907, Orthodox Albanian immigrant Kristaq Dishnica was refused funeral services in the United States by a local Orthodox Greek priest for being an Albanian involved in nationalist activities. Known as the Hudson incident, it galvanised the emigre Orthodox Albanian community to form the Albanian Orthodox Church under Fan Noli who hoped to counter Greek irredentism. \n\nOn March 18, 1908, as a result of the Hudson incident, Fan Noli was ordained as a priest by Russian bishop Platon in the United States. Noli conducted the Orthodox liturgy (March 1908) for the first time among the Albanian-American community in Albanian. Noli also devoted his efforts toward translating the liturgy into Albanian and emerging as a leader of the Orthodox Albanian community in the US. In 1911 he visited the Orthodox Albanian diasporas in Romania, Ukraine and Bulgaria.\n\nAfter Albanian independence in 1912, Fan Noli, who in 1924 would become an important political figure and prime minister of the nation, traveled to Albania, where he played an important role in establishing the Orthodox Albanian Church. On September 17, 1922, the first Orthodox Congress convened at Berat formally laid the foundations of an Albanian Orthodox Church and declared its autocephaly. Fan Noli was consecrated as Bishop of Korçë and primate of Albania, while the establishment of the Church was seen as an important development for maintaining Albanian national unity. At the end of the congress the First Statute of the Church was approved.\n\nThe Church had a Second Statute that amended the First Statute in a second congress gathered in Korçë on June 29, 1929. Also on September 6, 1929, the first Regulation of General Administration of the Church was approved. The Patriarchate in Constantinople recognised the independence or autocephaly of the Orthodox Albanian Church in 1937.\n\nOn November 26, 1950, the Parliament of Albania approved the Third Statute that abrogated the 1929 Statute. Such new statute required Albanian citizenship for the primate of the church in (article 4). With the exception of the amendments made in 1993, this statute is still in force for the Church.\n\nOn January 21, 1993, the 1950 statute was amended and in 1996 was approved by the then-president, Sali Berisha. In particular, article 4 of the 1950 statute, which required Albanian citizenship for primate of the church, was no longer so.\n\nOn November 3 and 4, 2006, at the new Monastery of St. Vlash in Durrës, there was a special Clergy-Laity Assembly of the Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania, attended by 257 representatives (including all clergy members). At this Assembly the New Constitution (Statute) of the Church was analyzed and accept unanimously. On November 6, 2006, the Holy Synod approved this Constitution (Statute). On November 24, 2008, the Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania and the Council of Ministers signed an agreement according to the 1998 Albanian Constitution, for the arrangement of their reciprocal relationship. The agreement was ratified by the Albanian Parliament, and became law (nr.10057) on January 22, 2009.\n\nThe Primate of the Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania is also the Archbishop of Tirana and Durrës. The current Archbishop of Tirana is Archbishop Anastasios of Albania.\n\nThe church greatly suffered during the dictatorship of Enver Hoxha as all churches were placed under government control, and land originally held by religious institutions were taken by the state. Religion in schools was banned. Similarly, Hoxha propagated that Albania was threatened by religion in general, since it served as the supposed \"Trojan Horse\" of the interests of the country's traditional enemies; in particular Orthodoxy (those of Greece and Serbia). In 1952 Archbishop Kristofor was discovered dead; most believed he had been killed.\n\nIn 1967 Hoxha closed down all religious buildings in the country, and declared Albania the world's first atheist country. All expression of religion, public or private, was outlawed. Hundreds of clergy were killed or imprisoned. As a result of this policy, a total of 600 Orthodox churches were demolished (1,600 present in 1944). Other buildings of the Orthodox community forcibly seized their religious function.\n\nAt the end of the communist rule, when religious freedom was restored, only 22 Orthodox priests remained alive. To deal with this situation, the Ecumenical Patriarch appointed Anastasios to be the Patriarchal Exarch for the Albanian Church. As Bishop of Androusa, Anastasios was dividing his time between his teaching duties at the University of Athens and the Archbishopric of Irinoupolis in Kenya, which was then going through a difficult patch, before his appointment. He was elected on June 24, 1992 and enthroned on August 2, 1992. Over time Anastasios has gained respect for his charity work and is now recognized as a spiritual leader of the Orthodox Church in Albania.\n\nOrthodox parishes with active liturgical lives have been established in a majority of cities and villages. Liturgical, preaching, and catechism ministries have been expanded, increasing the participation of both clergy and laity. Several groups have been organized to assist the church with its ministries: the Orthodox Women, and Orthodox Intellectuals. The moral and spiritual strength offered through the cultivation of a sound religious life is contributing decisively to the general progress of the Albanian society.\n\nMost parishes use the Albanian language in liturgy, while Greek is also partly used. In Greek minority areas the liturgy is accordingly celebrated in Greek.\n\nThe Church has prepared a new generation of clergy. Anastasios started a seminary in 1992, initially in a disused hotel, which was relocated to its own buildings at Shën Vlash In 1996, 15 kilometres from the port of Durrës. As of February 2011, there were 145 clergy members, all of which were Albanian citizens who graduated from the \"Resurrection of Christ Theological Academy\". This academy is also preparing new members (men and women) for catechism and for other services in different Church activities.\n\nMeanwhile, students are continuing their theological educations in well-known theological universities abroad.\n\nTwo ecclesiastical high schools for boys were opened – the \"Holy Cross\" in Gjirokastër in 1998, and the \"Holy Cross\" in Sukth of Durrës in 2007.\n\nSo far, 150 new churches have been built, 60 monasteries and more than 160 churches have been repaired.\nMany buildings have been built, and others have been bought and reconstructed for various purposes (such buildings, numbering 70, include: preschools, schools, youth centers, health centers, metropolitan sees, hospitality homes, workshops, soup kitchens, etc.).\nIn total there have been roughly 450 building projects.\nThrough its construction projects and provision of jobs, the Orthodox Church is contributing to the economic development of the nation and is one of the most serious investors in the country, offering work for many local builders and dozens of workers.\nSince 1995, the Church has put on an architecture course from time to time, each year giving more than 40 young people instruction in various aspects of ecclesiastical construction and architecture.\n\nThe Orthodox Church of Albania has its own radio station, named \"Ngjallja\" (Resurrection) which 24 hours a day broadcasts spiritual, musical, informative and educational programmes and lectures, and has a special children's programme.\n\nA monthly newspaper with the same name, \"Ngjallja\", is published, as well as a children's magazine \"Gëzohu\" (“Rejoice”), the magazine of the Orthodox Youth \"Kambanat\" (“Bells”), the student bulletin \"Fjala\" (“Word”), the news bulletin \"News from Orthodoxy in Albania\" (published in English), \"Tempulli\" (“Temple”) and \"Kërkim\" (“Searching/Research”), which contain cultural, social and spiritual materials, \"Enoria Jonë\" (“Our Parish”).\n\nAs of February 2008, more than 100 books with liturgical, spiritual, intellectual and academic topics have been published.\n\nThe Orthodox Church in Albania has taken various social initiatives. It started with health care, organising “The Annunciation” Orthodox Diagnostic Center in Tirana in 1999, with some of Albania's most renowned doctors and administers health care and most contemporary health services in 23 different specialties; four medical clinics, and one mobile dental clinic. The office “Service of Love” (\"Diakonia Agapes\") contributes to the increasing of midwives’ and nurses’ roles, offering training projects and assistance.\n\nThe Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania made extensive humanitarian contributions during the political and social crises (1992, 1994, 1997), collecting and distributing thousands of tons of food, clothing and medicine. In addition, it supported a wide range of social programs including: development projects in mountinous regions, especially in the areas of agriculture and farming; road construction; amelioration of water supplies; educational programs on health for children; construction of rural health centers and contributions for schools, orphanages, hospitals, institutes for the disabled, elderly homes, prisons (i.e. financed by the Church, where would prisoners work and receive income accordingly), sports grounds, soup kitchens for the poor, and many more.\n\nDuring 1999, when Albania accepted waves of refugees from Kosovo, the Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania, in collaboration with donors and other international religious organizations (especially ACT and WCC), led an extensive humanitarian program of more than $12 million, hosting 33,000 Kosovars in its two camps, supplying them with food, clothes, medical care and other goods.\n\nApart from the two ecclesiastical high schools, it has established three elementary schools (1st – 9th grade), 17 day-care centers and two institutes for professional training (named \"Spirit of Love\", established in Tirana in 2000) which are said to be the first of their kind in Albania and provide education in the fields of Team Management, IT Accounting, Computer Science, Medical Laboratory, Restoration and Conservation of Artwork and Byzantine Iconography. In Gjirokastër, 1 professional school, the orphanage “The Orthodox Home of Hope”, a high school dormitory for girls, has also given technical and material support to many public schools.\n\nAn environmental programme was started in 2001.\n\nAn Office of Cultural Heritage was established to look after the Orthodox structures considered to be national cultural monuments. A number of choirs have been organized in the churches. A Byzantine choir has also been formed and has produced cassettes and CDs. A workshop for the restoration and painting of icons was established with the aim to train a new generation of artists, to revive the rich tradition of iconography. The Church has also sponsored important academic publications, documentary films, academic symposiums and various exhibits of iconography, codex, children’s projects and other culturally related themes.\n\nThe Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania actively participates as equals in the events of the Orthodox Church worldwide. It is a member of the Conference of the European Churches (of which the Archbishop Anastasios has served as vice-president since December 2003), the World Council of the Churches (of which Archbishop Anastasios was chosen as one of eight presidents in 2006), and the largest inter-faith organization in the world, \"Religions for Peace\" (of which Anastasios was chosen as Honorary President in 2006). It is also active in various ecumenical conferences and programs. The Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania contributes to the efforts for peaceful collaboration and solidarity in the region and beyond.\n\nThe Holy Synod of Bishops was established in 1997, and is currently composed of:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2246643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246643", "title": "Wild Honey Pie", "text": "Wild Honey Pie\n\n\"Wild Honey Pie\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 double album \"The Beatles\" (also known as the \"White Album\"). It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon–McCartney. Less than a minute in length, the song mainly consists of the title being chanted repeatedly and was performed by McCartney without the participation of the other Beatles. The track is often viewed as a filler track and is generally regarded as inconsequential and unmemorable due to its experimental nature.\n\n\"Wild Honey Pie\" was recorded on 20 August 1968 at the end of the recording session for \"Mother Nature's Son\". Like \"Mother Nature's Son\", McCartney is the sole performer on the recording. At the time, John Lennon and Ringo Starr were working on other White Album songs, and George Harrison was on holiday in Greece. McCartney also recorded the unreleased song \"Etcetera\" during this session.\n\nMcCartney said of this song: \"We were in an experimental mode, and so I said, 'Can I just make something up?' I started off with the guitar and did a multitracking experiment in the control room or maybe in the little room next door. It was very home-made; it wasn't a big production at all. I just made up this short piece and I multitracked a harmony to that, and a harmony to that, and a harmony to that, and built it up sculpturally with a lot of vibrato on the [guitar] strings, really pulling the strings madly. Hence, 'Wild Honey Pie', which was a reference to the other song I had written called 'Honey Pie'.\"\n\n\"Wild Honey Pie\" was sequenced between \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" and \"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\", on side one of \"the White Album\". According to McCartney, the song might have been excluded but Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd, \"liked it very much so we decided to leave it on the album\".\n\nIn his book on the White Album, David Quantick describes \"Wild Honey Pie\" as a \"genuinely inferior\" piece that, after Lennon's avant-garde \"Revolution 9\", is among the tracks that are most commonly omitted from listeners' single-album versions of the Beatles' 1968 double LP. Author Mark Hertsgaard, referring to Lennon's distaste for \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\", writes: \"But at least 'Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da' had a real melody. 'Wild Honey Pie,' which followed it, simply assaulted the ear; it sounded like someone had taken a hammer to a giant pocket watch until the springs inside collapsed in heavy, discordant agony.\" Herstgaard says it was \"perhaps the most extreme case of self-indulgence on the album\". In his contemporary review of the album, Jann Wenner of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote a one-sentence summary of \"Wild Honey Pie\": \"[The song] makes a nice tribute to psychedelic music and allied forms.\"\n\nIn 2003, \"Stylus Magazine\" ranked \"Wild Honey Pie\" at number 1 on its list of the \"Top Ten Filler Tracks\" and described the song as \"the greatest piece of filler to ever clutter an over-ambitious double album\". They praised the \"painfully discordant guitar\" and felt the song to be \"[o]ne of the most famous half-songs in history.\" A \"Playing God\" piece by the same magazine from the following year, in which the author creates a personalised version of the track listing, included the song as the album's opening track, saying \"instead of [an] acclimation track like 'Back in the USSR', sound-wise at least, this version of The White Album utilizes the sproing guitar and yarbled vocals of 'Wild Honey Pie' as its opening salvo. It's meant here to let the listener know that this is going to be like no Beatles album they've ever heard.\" Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the White Album's release, Jacob Stolworthy of \"The Independent\" listed \"Wild Honey Pie\" in last place in his ranking of the album's 30 tracks, and commented: \"Thankfully one of The Beatles' shortest songs.\"\n\nAccording to author Ian MacDonald:\n\n\n"}

On the tour as a whole, he made 1,021 runs at an average of 32.93. His bowling proved expensive in English conditions, and he took 50 wickets, but at an average of 35.70. In the Tests, he took only four wickets. \n\nHe represented New Zealand in 12 Test matches between 1949 and the 1954–55 seasons and he was the South African Cricketer of the Year in 1954.\n\nAfter Second World War service as a Lancaster bomber pilot, Rabone had played only six first-class matches before being selected for 1949 New Zealand touring side to England. In a team of strokemakers headed by Martin Donnelly and Bert Sutcliffe, Rabone's normal batting style gave solidity to New Zealand's middle order. He played in all four Tests of the summer, making 148 runs but with a highest score of just 39. \n\nIn his next Test series, when the West Indies visited New Zealand in 1951–52, Rabone continued to be used primarily as a defensive batsman, taking 178 minutes to acore 37 as an opener, and then 83 minutes to score just nine in the middle order. And the following year, playing just one match when South Africa toured New Zealand, he took 215 minutes to score 29.\n\nIn 1953–54, New Zealand made its first Test-playing tour to a country other than England, a five-Test series in South Africa. Rabone was picked as captain, and though the side was unsuccessful in the big matches – the Test series was lost 4–0 – his own reputation for dependability and durability was enhanced. In the first Test, he made 107 out of a total of 230 in more than six hours, and followed that with 68 out of 149 in the second innings. In all, he batted for 585 out of the 675 minutes that his side's two innings lasted. That match was lost by an innings; the second, in which Rabone had little success, was lost by 132 runs. \n\nBut the third game, which ended as a draw, saw New Zealand's then-highest Test score, 505, and the first time the team had managed to enforce the follow-on. Rabone not only scored 56, but then took six wickets for 68 runs as South Africa were bowled out for 326, his best Test bowling. The tour ended in an anticlimax for Rabone, though, as he broke a bone in a foot during a provincial match and could not take part in the last two Tests. \n\nRabone was restored to the New Zealand captaincy the following year for the 1954–55 MCC tour of New Zealand. The results in the two Tests were poor and there was criticism of his captaincy, but Rabone's own adhesive qualities seemed undiminished. In the first innings of the first match, he was one of only two players – the other was Sutcliffe – to reach double figures, taking three hours to score 18. And in the second, when New Zealand were dismissed for the record Test low of 26, he was again second highest scorer and longest survivor, with 7 in 53 minutes. Both matches, though, were lost by a distance.\n\nThat was the end of his Test cricket, though he played for Auckland for a few more seasons. In retirement, he was a New Zealand selector. \n"}

Originally developed in Europe in the 1930s, it was introduced in the United States in the 1960s, but over the last 20 years it has become more prevalent within the pharmaceutical industry and is now widely considered to be the superior form of aseptic processing by various medicine regulatory agencies including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the packaging of pharmaceutical and healthcare products. \n\nThe basic concept of BFS is that a container is formed, filled, and sealed in a continuous process without human intervention, in a sterile enclosed area inside a machine. Thus this technology can be used to aseptically manufacture sterile pharmaceutical liquid dosage forms. \n\nThe process is multi-stepped: first, pharmaceutical-grade plastic resin is vertically heat extruded through a circular throat to form a hanging tube called the parison. This extruded tube is then enclosed within a two-part mould, and the tube is cut above the mould. The mould is transferred to the filling zone, or sterile filling space, where filling needles (mandrels) are lowered and used to inflate the plastic to form the container within the mould. Following the formation of the container, the mandrel is used to fill the container with liquid. Following filling the mandrels are retracted and a secondary top mould seals the container. All actions take place inside a sterile shrouded chamber inside the machine. The product is then discharged to a non-sterile area for labeling, packaging and distribution. \n\nBlow-fill-seal technology reduces personnel intervention making it a more robust method for the aseptic preparation of sterile pharmaceuticals. BFS is used for the filling of vials for parenteral preparations and infusions, eye drops, and inhalation products. Generally the plastic containers are made up of polyethylene and polypropylene. Polypropylene is more commonly used to form containers which are further sterilised by autoclaving as polypropylene has greater thermostability.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2246654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246654", "title": "The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill", "text": "The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\n\n\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\" is a song written by John Lennon (credited to Lennon–McCartney), and released by the English rock band the Beatles on their 1968 double album \"The Beatles\" (also known as the \"White Album\"). The song was recorded at EMI Studios on 8 October 1968 and was completed (including all overdubs) the same day. The group also started and completed the Lennon-composed \"I'm So Tired\" during the same recording session. Along with Lennon, the song also contains co-lead vocals by Yoko Ono, the only song recorded by the group to feature lead vocals by a non-member.\n\nThis song mocks the actions of a young American named Richard A. Cooke III, known as Rik, who was visiting his mother, Nancy Cooke de Herrera, at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh at the same time that the Beatles were staying with the Maharishi. According to his mother, both she and her son maintained friendly relations with all of the Beatles except for Lennon, who by Cooke de Herrera's account was \"a genius\" but distant and contemptuous of the wealthy American Cooke de Herrera and her clean-cut, college-attending son. According to Nancy's life account, \"Beyond Gurus\", the genesis of the song occurred when she, Rik, and several others, including guides, set out upon elephants to hunt for a tiger (allegedly presented by their Indian guide as a traditional act). The pack of elephants was attacked by a tiger, which was shot by Rik. Rik was initially proud of his quick reaction and posed for a photograph with his prize. However, Rik's reaction to the slaying was mixed, as he has not hunted since. Nancy claims that all present recognised the necessity of Rik's action, but that Lennon's reaction was scornful and sarcastic, asking Rik: \"But wouldn't you call that slightly life-destructive?\" The song was written by Lennon as mocking what he saw as Rik's bravado and unenlightened attitude.\n\nLennon later told his version of the story in a \"Playboy\" interview, stating that: \"'Bungalow Bill' was written about a guy in Maharishi's meditation camp who took a short break to go shoot a few poor tigers, and then came back to commune with God. There used to be a character called Jungle Jim, and I combined him with Buffalo Bill. It's sort of a teenage social-comment song and a bit of a joke.\" Mia Farrow, who was also at the ashram during the period, supports Lennon's story in her autobiography; she writes, \"Then a self-important, middle-aged American woman arrived, moving a mountain of luggage into the brand-new private bungalow next to Maharishi's along with her son, a bland young man named Bill. People fled this newcomer, and no one was sorry when she left the ashram after a short time to go tiger hunting, unaware that their presence had inspired a new Beatles song – 'Bungalow Bill.'\"\n\nThe note-sequence of the melody for the opening line, \"Hey Bungalow Bill\" is identical to that beginning \"Stay as Sweet as You Are\", the title line of the 1957 song. Both songs also subsequently rephrase the line at a lower pitch, adding to the possibility of a link.\n\nThe song opens with a flamenco guitar phrase, played from a standard Mellotron bank of pre-recorded rhythms and phrases by studio engineer Chris Thomas. It is unknown how the sample was chosen. The solo involves all seven notes of the Phrygian mode, including a Spanish-sounding II, a natural seventh from the harmonic minor scale and a blues-sounding 5. On some CD reissues, this solo closes the previous track, \"Wild Honey Pie\". The opening guitar solo is followed by the chorus in the key of C major, shifting between V (G on \"Bungalow\") and iv (Fm on \"what did you\"). What follows is a relative minor bridge starting with Am (on \"He went out\") then shifting to VI (F on \"elephant\") and VII (G on \"gun\"). Lennon then uses a V (E on \"all-American\") VII (G on \"bullet-headed\") i (Am on \"Saxon-mother's\") and VI (Fm on \"son\") to get back to the C major key. It is sung by all four Beatles, Ringo's then-wife Maureen, and Yoko Ono. The Mellotron reappears during the verses, played by Lennon, using mandolin samples, and during the outro, played by Thomas, using trombone samples. Lennon, who wrote the song, is the primary lead singer.

{"id": "2246657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246657", "title": "Androgen receptor", "text": "Androgen receptor\n\nThe androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4 (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 4), is a type of nuclear receptor that is activated by binding any of the androgenic hormones, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in the cytoplasm and then translocating into the nucleus. The androgen receptor is most closely related to the progesterone receptor, and progestins in higher dosages can block the androgen receptor.\n\nThe main function of the androgen receptor is as a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates gene expression; however, the androgen receptor has other functions as well. Androgen-regulated genes are critical for the development and maintenance of the male sexual phenotype.\n\nIn some cell types, testosterone interacts directly with androgen receptors, whereas, in others, testosterone is converted by 5-alpha-reductase to dihydrotestosterone, an even more potent agonist for androgen receptor activation. Testosterone appears to be the primary androgen receptor-activating hormone in the Wolffian duct, whereas dihydrotestosterone is the main androgenic hormone in the urogenital sinus, urogenital tubercle, and hair follicles. Testosterone is therefore responsible primarily for the development of male primary sexual characteristics, whilst dihydrotestosterone is responsible for secondary male characteristics.\n\nAndrogens cause slow maturation of the bones, but more of the potent maturation effect comes from the estrogen produced by aromatization of androgens. Steroid users of teen age may find that their growth had been stunted by androgen and/or estrogen excess. People with too little sex hormones can be short during puberty but end up taller as adults as in androgen insensitivity syndrome or estrogen insensitivity syndrome.\n\nAlso, AR knockout-mice studies have shown that AR is essential for normal female fertility, being required for development and full functionality of the ovarian follicles and ovulation, working through both intra-ovarian and neuroendocrine mechanisms.\n\nVia the androgen receptor, androgens play a key role in the maintenance of male skeletal integrity. The regulation of this integrity by androgen receptor (AR) signaling can be attributed to both osteoblasts and osteocytes.\n\nThe AR plays a role in regulating female sexual, somatic, and behavioral functions. Experimental data using AR knockout female mice, provides evidence that the promotion of cardiac growth, kidney hypertrophy, cortical bone growth and regulation of trabecular bone structure is a result of DNA binding-dependent actions of the AR in females. \n\nMoreover, the importance of understanding female androgen receptors lies in their role in several genetic disorders including Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). Complete (CAIS) and Partial (PAIS) which are a result of mutations in the genes which code for AR. These mutations (of which over 400 are known) causes the inactivation of AR due to mutations conferring resistance to circulating testosterone, with more than 400 different AR mutations reported.\n\nThe primary mechanism of action for androgen receptors is direct regulation of gene transcription. The binding of an androgen to the androgen receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor that, in turn, causes dissociation of heat shock proteins, transport from the cytosol into the cell nucleus, and dimerization. The androgen receptor dimer binds to a specific sequence of DNA known as a hormone response element. Androgen receptors interact with other proteins in the nucleus, resulting in up- or down-regulation of specific gene transcription. Up-regulation or activation of transcription results in increased synthesis of messenger RNA, which, in turn, is translated by ribosomes to produce specific proteins. One of the known target genes of androgen receptor activation is the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-1R). Thus, changes in levels of specific proteins in cells is one way that androgen receptors control cell behavior.\n\nOne function of androgen receptor that is independent of direct binding to its target DNA sequence, is facilitated by recruitment via other DNA-binding proteins. One example is serum response factor, a protein that activates several genes that cause muscle growth.\n\nAndrogen receptor is modified by post translational modification through acetylation, which directly promotes AR mediated transactivation, apoptosis and contact independent growth of prostate cancer cells. AR acetylation is induced by androgens and determines recruitment into chromatin. The AR acetylation site is a key target of NAD-dependent and TSA-dependent histone deacetylases and long non coding RNA.\n\nMore recently, androgen receptors have been shown to have a second mode of action. As has been also found for other steroid hormone receptors such as estrogen receptors, androgen receptors can have actions that are independent of their interactions with DNA. Androgen receptors interact with certain signal transduction proteins in the cytoplasm. Androgen binding to cytoplasmic androgen receptors can cause rapid changes in cell function independent of changes in gene transcription, such as changes in ion transport. Regulation of signal transduction pathways by cytoplasmic androgen receptors can indirectly lead to changes in gene transcription, for example, by leading to phosphorylation of other transcription factors.\n\nIn humans, the androgen receptor is encoded by the \"AR\" gene located on the X chromosome at Xq11-12.\n\nThe androgen insensitivity syndrome, formerly known as testicular feminization, is caused by a mutation of the androgen receptor gene located on the X chromosome (locus:Xq11-Xq12).\nThe androgen receptor seems to affect neuron physiology and is defective in Kennedy's disease. In addition, point mutations and trinucleotide repeat polymorphisms has been linked to a number of additional disorders.\n\nThe AR gene contains CAG repeats which affect receptor function, where fewer repeats leads to increased receptor sensitivity to circulating androgens and more repeats leads to decreased receptor sensitivity. Studies have shown that racial variation in CAG repeats exists, with African-Americans having fewer repeats than non-Hispanic white Americans. The racial trends in CAG repeats parallels the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer in these groups.\n\nTwo isoforms of the androgen receptor (A and B) have been identified:\n\nLike other nuclear receptors, the androgen receptor is modular in structure and is composed of the following functional domains labeled A through F:\n\nAR-V7 is an androgen receptor splice variant that can be detected in circulating tumor cells of metastatic prostate cancer patients. and is predictive of resistance to some drugs.\n\n\n\n\nThe AR is an important therapeutic target in prostate cancer. Thus many different antiandrogens have been developed, primarily targeting the ligand binding domain of the protein. AR ligands can either be classified based on their structure (steroidal or nonsteroidal) or based on their ability to activate or inhibit transcription (agonists or antagonists). Inhibitors that target alternative functional domains (N-terminal domain, DNA binding domain) of the protein are still under development.\n\nAndrogen receptor has been shown to interact with:\n\n"}

The song modulates through several keys.\n\nThe song key is E major, showing up embellished chords with jazzy sprinkled dissonances. The verse is a syncopated replicate of the first melodic section adding two extra beats, a technique similar to that used later by McCartney in “Two of Us”. Though the bridge is in the key of F major, the manner in which it abruptly sets in and exits makes it sound more out-of-the-way than it really is.\n\nThe song was recorded over two days on 4 and 5 October 1968 at Trident Studios in London. McCartney recorded the piano, drums, and vocals on the first day. He was advised to have George Martin play the piano solo because it was believed that the solo was beyond Paul's competency, but Paul persisted. George Martin's brass and string arrangements were overdubbed later that day.

It was written and sung by John Lennon, though credited to Lennon–McCartney. Lennon wrote the song during the Beatles' stay in India about insomnia he was having due to constant meditation and because he missed Yoko Ono. The song was recorded in the same session as another White Album song, \"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\".\n\nLennon wrote the song at a Transcendental Meditation camp when he could not sleep; the Beatles had gone on a retreat to study with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh, India. After three weeks of constant meditation and lectures, Lennon missed Yoko Ono, with whom he had yet to start a relationship, and was plagued by insomnia, which inspired the song. One of dozens of songs the Beatles wrote in India, \"I'm So Tired\" detailed Lennon's fragile state of mind. It was also an open letter to Yoko Ono, whose postcards to Lennon in India were a lifeline. \"I got so excited about her letters,\" he said. \"I started thinking of her as a woman, and not just an intellectual woman.\" Lennon later said of it: \"One of my favourite tracks. I just like the sound of it, and I sing it well\".\n\nThe theme of insomnia complements Lennon's earlier song \"I'm Only Sleeping\" on the \"Revolver\" album.\n\nThe song is in the key of A major and features Lennon singing the main tune in a slow, flowing fashion while the rest of the band sings the chorus, which is repeated twice and yelled at the end of the second time.\n\nAn early demo of the song was recorded at George Harrison's Esher home, in May 1968.

The chorus of the monaural mix of the song features louder backing vocals from Paul McCartney than the stereo mix.\n\nAt the very end of the song, what seems to be nonsensical mumbling can be heard in the background. The mumbling, if played backwards can be imagined as something along the lines of \"Paul is a dead man. Miss him. Miss him. Miss him.\" This only adds to the many supposed references to the \"Paul is dead\" conspiracy scattered throughout the White album. Mark Lewisohn has said that the mumbling is actually Lennon muttering, \"Monsieur, monsieur, how about another one?\"\n\nCoinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, Jacob Stolworthy of \"The Independent\" listed \"I'm So Tired\" at number 18 in his ranking of the White Album's 30 tracks.

A favourite of his, the song is best when viewed as a sequel to \"Revolver\" track, 'I'm Only Sleeping'.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2246680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246680", "title": "Itelmen language", "text": "Itelmen language\n\nItelmen (autonym: \"itənmən\") or Western Itelmen, formerly known as Western Kamchadal, is a language of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan family spoken on the western coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Fewer than a hundred native speakers, mostly elderly, in a few settlements in the southwest of Koryak Autonomous Okrug, remained in 1993. The 2002 Census counted 3,180 ethnic Itelmens, virtually all of whom are now monolingual in Russian. However, there are attempts to revive the language, and it is being taught in a number of schools in the region.\n\n(Western) Itelmen is the only surviving Kamchatkan language. It has two dialects, Sedanka and Xajrjuzovo (Ukä).\n\nOriginally the Kamchatkan languages were spoken throughout Kamchatka and possibly also in the northern Kuril Islands. Vladimir Atlasov, who annexed Kamchatka and established military bases in the region, estimated in 1697 that there were about 20,000 ethnic Itelmens. The explorer Stepan Krasheninnikov, who gave the first detailed description of the Itelmen language and culture, identified the three main dialects, but explained that all Itelmens could understand each other.\n\nFrom the time of Atlasov, Russian fur traders began to settle in the region. There were frequent clashes between Cossacks and Itelmens, who rebelled against Russian domination. Many Itelmen were forcibly converted to Christianity, and by the early nineteenth century all Itelmen were forced to adopt Russian names. Intermarriage with Russian settlers led to the development of a creole known as Kamchadal, traces of which remain in the Russian dialect now spoken in Kamchatka.\n\nDuring the Soviet era the process of assimilation intensified, as Itelmen communities were moved by force and children were sent to boarding schools where they were required to speak Russian. By the end of the 1930s Russian was the medium of instruction in all schools, and children grew up speaking Russian as their main language.\n\nHowever it was also during this period that Itelmen was written down for the first time. In 1930, a Latin-based alphabet was designed for all the native languages of northern Siberia, and in 1932, a 27-letter Itelmen alphabet was created. A few textbooks were written in this alphabet during the 1930s, but it was quickly abandoned. More recently, a Cyrillic-based alphabet, designed in 1986 and consisting of 32 letters, has been used.\n\nItelmen is now highly endangered, and most speakers are aged over sixty and live in scattered communities. However, there is a movement to revive the language, and educational materials are being developed. Modern Itelmen has been heavily influenced by Russian lexically, phonologically and grammatically.\n\nItelmen has a larger phonological inventory than other Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages, and permits complex consonant clusters in some environments. However, Itelmen has a different system of vowel harmony than its relatives Chukchi and Koryak.\n\nVolodin (1997) gives the following consonant inventory, shown here with both the Cyrillic and IPA forms. Itelmen is unusual in having a voicing (VOT) distinction in fricatives but not in plosives.\n\nIn addition to the consonants shown above, some sources also include the glottal stop , as well as glottalised nasal and lateral phonemes, including , , and . 's' and 'z' may be apical post-alveolar fricatives rather than alveolar fricatives. There may also be distinct labialised consonant phonemes.\n\nThere are five vowel phonemes: and . Schwa () also appears but its phonemic status is unclear.\n\nThere are two points of view about where Itelmen belongs genetically. According to the first theory, Itelmen and Chukotkan languages derived from a common proto-language; the sharp differences of Itelmen, noticed at all levels, are explained by the intense influence of other languages; it is suggested that Itelmen absorbed a different non-Chukotko-Kamchatkan language. According to the second theory, Itelmen is not related to other Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages; common elements are due to contact.\n\nInitial comparisons of the basic Itelmen lexicon to Chukotkan show that only a third of the word stock is cognate. This result is preliminary due to the incompleteness of Chukotko-Kamchatkan comparative phonetics. Arends et al. (1995) state that Itelmen is a mixed language, with Chukotkan morphology and a lexicon from a separate language, possibly related to Gilyak or Wakashan. Itelmen would thus be a creole of a Luorawetlan language and Gilyak/Wakashan just as Kamchadal became a creole of Itelmen and Russian. However, Fortescue (2005) partially reconstructed the Chukotko-Kamchatkan proto-language. See Kamchatkan languages#Classification.\n\nThere may be different answers given to the question of which elements of Itelmen are original and which have been brought about by contact with other languages. To take the second hypothesis, Itelmen was at the very beginning an agglutinative language, with word structure (m) + R + (m) (where R is a root and (m) one of several word-changing morphemes), it was nominal, compounds were prohibited; it preserves all of these elements into the present. A difference in reported material origin with Chukotko-Koryak languages in declensional and conjugational paradigms is the result of convergent development under conditions of a Chukotko-Kamchatkan Sprachbund. Incorporation goes against word structure (not more than one root morpheme), thus Itelmen did not take it on. Reduplication of a root, inherent to all the languages of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan group, was able to develop in Itelmen apart from the influence of contact.\n\nRussian borrowings in Itelmen already started to appear in the 17th century. Among the Russian words that were borrowed, in some cases replacing Itelmen words, adjectives and adverbs predominate and even preserve Russian morphology: \"vostr-oy\" sharp-, \"krasn-oy\" red-, \"sinny-oy\" blue-, \"svez-oy\" fresh-, etc. Borrowed verbs adapt in accordance with the demands of Itelmen morphology: Itel. \"stara'lkas\" (Rus. \"starat'sya\") means 'to try', Itel. \"otkaza'lkas\" (Rus. \"otkazyvat'sya\") 'to deny,' It. \"napraves\" means 'to cook food'. To speak of Russian borrowings in Itelmen today is hardly possible, because all Itelmens speak Russian much better than their native language.\n\nThe Itelmen language is an agglutinative language, it has affixes for nouns and verbs, and most of its affixes are suffixes.\n\nIts basic word order is subject–object–verb, numerals and demonstratives are placed before the noun they modify, although adjectives can be placed before or after the noun they modify.\n\nItelmen is not standardized and does not have a separate literary variety. A retelling of Itelmen mythology was written in Russian by Krasheninnikov. Folk language (only recordings from the 20th century survive, Western language) does not show special characteristics compared to the conversational language.\n\nWriting based on Latin graphemes was introduced in 1932 (an alphabet book and arithmetic textbook were published). Teaching from the alphabet book of 1932 (authored by ethnographer Elizabeth Porfirevna Orlova and co-produced by a group of Itelmen students) lasted several years; but after alphabets for \"Northern\" languages were transformed into Cyrillic at the end of the 1930s, Itelmen writing was abolished. Itelmen became an unwritten language and remained that way for almost a half century.\n\nThe modern Itelmen alphabet was created in 1984 on a Cyrillic base and in 1988 was confirmed by the Russian Ministry of Education. A second Itelmen alphabet book was created in 1988. An Itelmen-Russian/Russian-Itelmen dictionary and second-grade textbook were also published. In 1993 the Itelmen alphabet book was republished. Itelmen has been taught as a subject in elementary grades, but teachers do not speak the language like the students. In 2002 a translation of the Gospel of Luke was published in Itelmen. All of these works are published in the Southern dialect.\n\nA deepening sign (˚) and glottal stop sign (ʼ) are also used in instructional works. In the sequence of instructionally published signs Ă ă, Ŏ ŏ, Ў ў are not considered separate letters. Also, in many publications \"Ԓ ԓ\" and \"Ӽ ӽ\" are used in place of the letters \"Ԯ ԯ (Ӆ ӆ)\" and \"Ҳ ҳ\" (for example in the \"Historical Ethnographic Handbook of Itelmen\", Krasnodar, 2005).\n\nThe newspaper \"Native of Kamchatka\", which regularly publishes works in Itelmen, does not use the letters 'Ă ă, Ŏ ŏ, Ў ў but does use the deepening sign (˚).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2246691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246691", "title": "Roman governor", "text": "Roman governor\n\nA Roman governor was an official either elected or appointed to be the chief administrator of Roman law throughout one or more of the many provinces constituting the Roman Empire. A Roman governor is also known as a propraetor or proconsul.\n\nThe generic term in Roman legal language was \"Rector provinciae,\" regardless of the specific titles, which also reflect the province's intrinsic and strategic status, and corresponding differences in authority.\n\nBy the time of the early empire, there were two types of provinces—senatorial and imperial—and several types of governor would emerge. Only \"proconsuls\" and \"propraetors\" fell under the classification of promagistrate.\n\nThe governor was the province's chief judge. The governor had the sole right to impose capital punishment, and capital cases were normally tried before him. To appeal a governor's decision necessitated travelling to Rome and presenting one's case before either the Praetor Urbanus, or even the Emperor himself, an expensive, and thus rare, process. An appeal was unlikely to succeed anyway, as a governor wouldn’t generally take the chance of convicting someone contrary to the Emperor's wishes. The governor was also supposed to travel across his province to administer justice in the major towns where his attention was required.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, he commanded the military forces within the province. In the more important provinces, this could consist of legions, but elsewhere, there were only auxiliaries. As a part of his standing orders the governor had the authority to use his legions to stamp out organized criminal gangs or rebels in the area without need for the Emperor's or Senate's approval.\n\nEvery governor had at his disposal a diversity of advisors and staff, who were known as his comites (Latin for \"companions\"); the number of these depended on the governor's social standing and rank. These comites would serve as the governor's executive council, with each supervising a different aspect of the province, and assisting the governor in decision making. In the provinces with a significant legionary presence, the governor's second-in-command was usually a quaestor, a man elected in Rome and sent to the province to serve a mainly financial role, but who could command the military with the governor's approval. In other provinces, governors themselves appointed non-magistrate prefects or procurators to govern a small part of the province and act as their second-in-command.\n\nDuring the era of the Roman Republic, the council was in charge of appointing governors to Rome's provinces. This was done by appointing promagistrates to serve, either by random casting of lots or by \"senatus consultum\" (advice of the Senate); however, these appointments were not formally binding on a legal basis and could be nullified by Roman assemblies.\n\nThe governor's level of authority was determined by what type of \"imperium\" he possessed. Most provinces were governed by propraetors who had served an annual term in the praetorship the year before. The provinces governed by propraetors were usually the more tranquil ones, where chances of revolt or invasion were small, but in some cases propraetors would be given command of more troubled provinces.\n\nProvinces that lay on the empire's borders, thereby requiring a permanent military garrison, were governed by proconsuls who had served a term as consul (the highest rank of magistrate) the year before their governorship. They were given the authority to command provinces with actual Roman legions, rather than just using the militia.\n\nThese promagistrates held equality with other magistrates with the same level of imperium and were attended by the same number of lictors. Generally speaking, they had autocratic power within their provinces. A provincial governor almost possessed unlimited authority and often extorted vast amounts of money from the provincial population—but, though he retained immunity from prosecution as long as he held his imperium, once he left office he became vulnerable to prosecution for his actions during his term.\n\nAfter Augustus established the principate, the Emperor himself was the direct governor of Rome's most important provinces (called imperial provinces) and even in the provinces he did not directly govern, was senior to other provincial governors through holding imperium maius, or supreme imperium. In imperial provinces, the Emperor would appoint legates to govern in his name. The Emperor had sole say in the appointing of these legates, who were lower in rank than other provincial governors, as officially they were only representatives of the province's true governor, the Emperor.\n\nThe principate did not totally do away with the system of selecting proconsuls and propraetors. In provinces with one legion, a legate bearing praetorian imperium, thus being a \"propraetor\", not only governed the province in the Emperor's name, but also controlled the legion himself. However, in provinces with more than one legion, each legion was commanded by its own legate with praetorian imperium, while the province as a whole was commanded by a legate with consular imperium, who had general command over the entire army stationed there, as well as administering the province as a proconsul.\n\nAppointment to these governorships was completely at the whim of the Emperor and could last anywhere from 1 to 5 years.\n\nWhile the Emperor had sole authority in provinces with legions, senatorial provinces were provinces where the Senate had the right to appoint governors. These provinces were away from the Empire's borders and free from the likelihood of rebellion, and so had few, if any, legions stationed in them (thus lessening the chance the Senate might try to seize power from the Emperor).\n\nThese provinces were under the authority of proconsular or propraetorian senators invariably styled 'proconsul', with little need for intervention by the Emperor (although the Emperor had the power to appoint these governors if he wished). Most senatorial provinces, since they were not under the direct authority of the Emperor, did not grant the governor legions to command. There was one exception to this rule, the province of Africa, where there was always at least a single legion to protect the province from Berber tribes.\n\nAugustus decreed that at least ten provinces would be held by the authority of the Roman people through the agency of the Senate. Though all ten were \"proconsular\", only two of these provinces (Asia and Africa), were actually governed by senators with proconsular imperium, the remaining eight being governed by propraetors. The two proconsular governors served for one year, while the eight praetors served typically for up to 3 years. Each of these men had six lictors who served as bodyguards and also as a symbol of authority and a mark of their position.\n\nThe Emperor also had under his control a number of smaller, but potentially difficult provinces that did not need an entire legion. These provinces were put under the control of governors of equestrian status. New conquests generally fell into this equestrian category, but most were later changed in status to reflect the changing conditions of Rome's growing empire. Thus, on conquest a province would become a procuratorial province until it was decided that it should become either an imperial or senatorial province and thus governed by either a propraetor or proconsul. Like the other imperial provinces, the equestrian governors could serve any length of time up to 5 years, or even longer.\n\nMuch like the senatorial province of Africa, the equestrian province of Aegyptus (Egypt) was an exception to the general rule of legions only being stationed in imperial provinces. Egypt was not a normal province; it was considered the personal possession of the Emperor, and its governor, the \"praefectus Aegypti\", was considered the hold the highest ranking equestrian post during the early empire. Later, the post would fall second to that of the praetorian command, but its position remained highly prestigious.\n\nThough the practice of appointing equestrians to help manage provinces officially began with Augustus, governors from years before had appointed procurators to help them govern. However, it was not until the reign of Claudius that these procurators received the powers of a governor. Procurators were civilian officials, unlike prefects. It is important to note that procurators were not magistrates, so did not possess imperium, and merely exercised the Emperor’s, or governor's, authority with his approval.\n\nThe provincial governors were the most important officials in the Roman administration for it was they who were responsible for tax collection, justice in the first instance and public order in the first instance. They received, from the prefectures, the tax demands three times a year, which they circulated to the municipalities.\n\nUnder the Dominate, \"i.e.\" the Late Roman Empire, the emperor Diocletian began in AD 293 reforms of the provincial administration that were completed under the Emperor Constantine the Great in 318. Diocletian set up 12 dioceses (later several were split; see under Roman province), originally two to four for each of the four co-emperors under the short-lived Tetrarchy (two senior \"Augusti\", each above a \"Caesar\"), each governed by a \"vicarius\" ('vicar') who acted on behalf of the praetorian prefect. Each diocese comprised several Roman provinces (known in Greek as \"eparchies\"), each under the authority of a provincial governor, whose title varied from province to province (the range of titles includes republican relics such as \"proconsul,\" as well as novelties such as \"corrector provinciae\", \"moderator provinciae\", and \"praeses provinciae\"). Although the vicar's authority was supreme within his diocese, he was under the authority of praetorian prefect whose power he partook of (see below) or the emperor himself.\n\nConstantine completely removed the governors' military commands, a process begun under Diocletian. In those provinces where soldiers were stationed, the \"dux\" (Latin for leader) commanded border military units. Some \"duces\" commanded units in several provinces: they were watched by the diocesan vicars. Field units were commanded by a \"comes\" ('companion', whence \"count\") and later by supreme military commanders, the \"magistri militum\".\n\nConstantine, again following Diocletian's lead, organized the Roman Empire into three praetorian prefectures late in his reign. These were based on the territories controlled by the four co-emperors of the Tetrarchy, two of whom, the senior Augusti, had been served by a praetorian prefect as something like a chief of staff. The three prefectures thus created were the prefecture of Gaul, the prefecture of Italy, Africa, and Illyricum (later divided by Constans in 347 or perhaps in 342/47), and the prefecture of the East, each being administered by an imperially-appointed Praetorian prefect. The prefect of each prefecture was the highest civilian officer, being subordinate only to the emperor(s). The prefect was the superior of the vicars and governors. He was the chief appellate judge, head of the administration of the prefecture, chief finance officer, and chief tax collector (though the collection was actually done at municipal and village levels).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2246693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246693", "title": "Piggies", "text": "Piggies\n\n\"Piggies\" is a song by the English rock group the Beatles from their 1968 album \"The Beatles\" (also known as \"the White Album\"). Written by George Harrison as a social commentary, the song serves as an Orwellian satire on greed and consumerism. Among several elements it incorporates from classical music, the track features harpsichord and orchestral strings in the baroque pop style, which are contrasted by Harrison's acerbic lyrics and the sound of grunting pigs. Although credited to George Martin, the recording was largely produced by Chris Thomas, who also contributed the harpsichord part.\n\nIn the context of the turbulent political climate of 1968, \"Piggies\" was adopted by the counterculture as an anti-establishment theme song. It was also among the tracks on \"The Beatles\" that cult leader Charles Manson used as the foundation for his Helter Skelter theory of an American race-related countercultural revolution. Inspired especially by the line \"What they need's a damn good whacking\", Manson's followers left clues relating to the lyrics at the scenes of the Tate–LaBianca murders in August 1969.\n\n\"Piggies\" has received widely varying responses from music critics, and its reputation suffered due to the association with Manson following the latter's trial in 1971. While some reviewers admire its musical qualities and recognise sardonic humour in the lyrics, others consider the song to be mean-spirited and lacking in subtlety. Harrison's demo of the song, recorded at his home in Surrey, was included on the Beatles' 1996 compilation \"Anthology 3\". A live version by Harrison, reinstating a verse that was omitted from the studio recording, appears on his 1992 album \"Live in Japan\". Folk singer and activist Theo Bikel and anarcho-punk musician Danbert Nobacon are among the artists who have covered \"Piggies\".\n\nGeorge Harrison began writing \"Piggies\" in early 1966, around the time that the Beatles were recording their album \"Revolver\". He returned to the song two years later, after discovering his manuscript in the attic of his parents' house in Liverpool. The same visit led to Harrison starting a new composition, \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", which he similarly completed for inclusion on the Beatles' self-titled double album (also known as \"the White Album\").\nAs an anti-establishment song, \"Piggies\" recalls Harrison's \"Revolver\" composition \"Taxman\". In his 1980 autobiography, \"I, Me, Mine\", Harrison describes \"Piggies\" as a social commentary. He intended it as a light-hearted satire on consumerism and class distinction. Through its theme of social strata within a community of farm animals (in this case, one consisting entirely of pigs), the song references George Orwell's 1945 novel \"Animal Farm\". According to Harrison's early draft of \"Piggies\", the lyrics contained a final verse, subsequently cut for the Beatles' recording, that ends with the animals \"Paying piggy thanks – to thee Pig Brother!\" Musicologist Walter Everett cites these words as evidence that Harrison's main inspiration for the song was Orwell's work, particularly \"his fable of autocracy masquerading as democracy, \"Animal Farm\"\". While also identifying Orwell's book as an influence on the composition, author Ian Inglis views \"Piggies\" as one of several White Album songs in which the Beatles drew inspiration from their childhood in the 1940s.\n\nDuring Harrison's Liverpool visit in early 1968, his mother, Louise, responded to his request for assistance with the lyrics by providing the line \"What they need's a damn good whacking\". Harrison then taped a demo of the song at his house in Esher, Surrey, in late May that year. Following this recording, John Lennon supplied the final phrase in the line \"Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon\", replacing the words \"to cut their pork chops\", which Harrison had sung on the demo version. When performing \"Piggies\" in concert during the early 1990s, Harrison reinstated the omitted final verse.\n\nFrom 1966, particularly in the United States, the slang usage of the word \"pig\" had grown from being a derogatory term for a police officer to refer also to consumerism and establishment figures in general. This was especially so in 1968, as the counterculture became more politically focused, coinciding with the rise of the Black Power movement and the number of mass demonstrations against America's involvement in the Vietnam War. Although author Jon Wiener terms Harrison and Lennon \"the radicals among the Beatles\", citing their past outspokenness about Vietnam and their readiness to embrace LSD experimentation and Transcendental Meditation, Harrison denied that he was using \"pig\" in its new context. Inglis nevertheless says that the song title alone \"references\" the countercultural view of police officers.\n\"Piggies\" features baroque musical elements in its melody and texture. Music journalist Steve Smith groups the song with the Paul McCartney-written \"For No One\" and \"She's Leaving Home\" as examples of the Beatles' forays into baroque pop. Harrison biographer Simon Leng recognises the composition as essentially a folk song, however, that was then given a \"satirical, drawing-room [musical] arrangement\" on the official recording by the prominence of harpsichord and orchestral strings.\n\nThe song's musical key is A. Its structure comprises two verses, a middle eight (or bridge) section, an instrumental passage (over the verse melody), followed by a final verse that leads into a coda (or outro) and a formal ending.<ref name=\"Pollack/Notes\"></ref> In his commentary on \"Piggies\", musicologist Alan Pollack remarks on its abundance of classical music traits. These include the use of \"arpeggio fragments\" in Harrison's opening guitar motif and the repetition of this four-bar passage before each verse and the bridge – a device typical of Schubert's various lieder and the works of other nineteenth-century composers. During the song, the expected cycle of fifth notes in the major scale is interrupted through the inclusion of a III7 (C7) chord, which first appears at the end of the passage leading into the middle eight, before the melody drops down a tone to the minor ii (Bm) chord. The same section's first line ends with the surprise inclusion of a blues-based riff, soon after which the C7 chord is used again in the ascent to the IV (subdominant) chord, helping to accentuate the phrase \"damn good whacking\".\n\nAs a further example of the melody's baroque characteristics, the bridge contains an implied but unfulfilled tonicisation of VI. In addition, over the coda, the recurring four-bar instrumental passage is partly shifted to a parallel minor, through the use of the more classically oriented Am chord, rather than its major equivalent as before. Following the instrumental coda, the song ends with the strings playing a tonically ambiguous cadence, which Everett describes as an unexpected \"diminished fourth away from tonic\".\n\nInglis writes that while the nursery rhyme form was Harrison's musical source for \"Piggies\", his lyrics adopt a political perspective, creating \"a savage attack on the corporate greed of contemporary capitalism\". In the first verse, Harrison sings of \"the little piggies\", for whom \"life is getting worse\". In verse two, \"the bigger piggies\" are described as \"stirring up\" the dirt that those smaller animals \"crawl\" in, while they themselves are dressed in \"starched white shirts\". According to music journalist Kit O'Toole, whereas the song's harpsichord-led introduction \"suggests a salon featuring royalty in their finery\", the lyrics immediately nullify this image in their depiction of pigs toiling in mud, thereby heightening the overall satirical effect. Everett comments that the same contrast between refined instrumentation and uncompromising subject matter was later adopted by Stevie Wonder for his track \"Village Ghetto Land\", issued on \"Songs in the Key of Life\" (1976).\n\nDuring the middle eight, Harrison refers to the privileged pigs in their sties who \"don't care what goes on around\"; they appear devoid of empathy, and therefore deserve \"a damn good whacking\". In the third verse, Harrison declares that piggies are \"everywhere\", leading \"piggy lives\". He presents a final image of couples dining, holding their cutlery before devouring bacon.\n\nThe Beatles recorded the basic track for \"Piggies\" at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London on 19 September 1968. After Harrison had performed the song alone on the Esher demo – playing acoustic guitar and whistling over the solo – the use of harpsichord on the official recording came about through happenstance. Acting as a producer in George Martin's absence on some of the White Album sessions, Chris Thomas noticed the instrument set up in preparation for a later session, for a classical recording, in EMI's Studio 1. Harrison agreed that a harpsichord part would suit the song, and so the Beatles' session was moved from Studio 2.\n\nThe group taped eleven takes of \"Piggies\" before achieving the requisite performance. The line-up was Harrison on acoustic guitar, Thomas on harpsichord, McCartney on bass and Ringo Starr on tambourine. Lennon was present at the session but, with only 4-track recording facilities available in Studio 1 (and the available tracks taken up by the other four musicians), he did not play on the basic track. Having attended London's Royal Academy of Music as a child, Thomas performed the harpsichord solo in an authentic classical style, according to Pollack, who highlights how \"the melody played by the last three fingers [of the right hand] alternates with a repeated note played by the thumb\".\n\nOn 20 September, the recording was copied over to 8-track tape in Studio 2, to allow for overdubbing. Harrison then added his lead vocal, together with harmony vocals on the last verse, creating a mock operatic chorus over the latter section. Through the combination of studio effects and overdubs, his vocal performance on the song consists of three contrasting segments; in Inglis' description, these comprise a \"naturalistic\" approach at the start of the track, \"a distorted middle\", and chorus singing at the end. To produce the sharp nasal sound over the middle eight, Harrison sang through a filter that limited the signal to a narrow, 3.5-kilohertz band. Described by Everett as \"remarkable\", the pitch of Harrison's vocals in the final verse ranges from a low E bass note in one of the harmony parts, to a descant falsetto B in the high harmony part. Lennon created a tape loop of pre-recorded pig noises, sourced from EMI's library, as well as supplying his own grunting sounds. Drum beats were also added, marking the transition from the solo into the third verse.\n\nFinal overdubs on the song were carried out on 10 October, during the last week of recording for \"The Beatles\". Having returned from his extended holiday, Martin wrote a string arrangement for four violins, two violas and two cellos. These parts were recorded during the same orchestral overdubbing session as for Lennon's track \"Glass Onion\". Towards the end of \"Piggies\", Harrison added the spoken words \"One more time\", before the orchestra played the last two chords. In his overview of the recording, author and critic Tim Riley interprets the \"thick scouse\" delivery of this introduction to the \"final grand cadence\" as Harrison \"smearing social elitists with their own symbols of 'high' culture\". Everett refers to the contrast between the various classical elements and the combination of pig sounds and \"rude\" final cadence as representing an \"Orwellian comparison of pigs to socially horrid, though outwardly refined, tyrants\".\n\nMixing on \"Piggies\" was completed on 11 October. The mono mix has the animal sounds appearing at different points in the song, relative to the stereo version. In addition, Harrison's guitar is more prominent in the mono mix.\n\nApple Records, the Beatles' EMI-distributed record label, released \"The Beatles\" on 22 November 1968, with \"Piggies\" sequenced as the fourth track on side two of the double LP. It appeared between two other songs with animal names in their titles – \"Blackbird\" and \"Rocky Raccoon\".<ref name=\"Gerard/PM\"></ref> The animal-themed sequencing was a deliberate decision on the part of Lennon and McCartney,<ref name=\"Fontenot/About\"></ref> who prepared the running order of the album's 30 tracks, with Martin, after Harrison had left for Los Angeles to work with Apple signing Jackie Lomax.\nAccording to author Mark Hertsgaard, \"Piggies\" \"[kept] the Beatles' countercultural flame alive\", as the song was embraced as an anti-authoritarian anthem by the counterculture, following a year of protests and civil unrest in many Western countries. Among many such events in the United States, police officers clashed violently with anti-Vietnam War demonstrators at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August 1968. David A. Noebel, an American arch-conservative, paired the song with \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" when he accused the Beatles of being pro-Communist and leading a move towards revolutionary socialism with the White Album. Along with McCartney's \"Rocky Raccoon\", however, \"Piggies\" was also criticised by the radical New Left as an example of the Beatles resorting to whimsical parody instead of directly addressing contemporary issues.\n\nAmong the more conservative elements of the British establishment and the public, the release of \"The Beatles\" coincided with a less tolerant attitude towards the band. On 19 October, two days after the 24-hour session to sequence the album, Lennon, along with Yoko Ono, was arrested for possession of cannabis; Lennon described the bust as a \"set-up\" by the London Drug Squad. During a radio interview shortly afterwards, in Los Angeles, Harrison questioned the local police department's motto \"To serve and protect\" when asked about the criminality of smoking marijuana. In mid November, he represented the Beatles on \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\", which was in conflict at the time with the CBS television network over its political satire and regularly subjected to censorship. Author John Winn describes Harrison's guest appearance as \"an important show of support\" following Richard Nixon's recent US election win.\n\nWriting in the \"International Times\", Barry Miles found \"Piggies\" \"unsubtle\" and likely to appeal to \"those involved with Chicago's pig-police\". William Mann of \"The Times\" noted the recurring nature theme throughout the album, from brief mentions of monkeys, lizards, elephants and tigers, to song titles such as \"Blackbird\" and \"Piggies\", and asked of Harrison's characters: \"are they Chicago police or just company directors?\" \"Melody Maker\"s Alan Walsh admired the instrumentation on the recording and deemed \"Piggies\" to be \"The Beatles' satire track ... a kick at upper-class reactionaries or journalists (or both)\". In his unfavourable review of the White Album, in \"The New York Times\", Mike Jahn considered that many of the tracks were \"either so corny or sung in such a way that it is hard to tell whether [the Beatles] are being serious\", among which the words of Harrison's song served as \"an act of lyrical overstatement\".\n\n\"Record Mirror\" remarked that the birdsong effects of \"Blackbird\" were replaced by \"snorts and grunts\" on \"Piggies\", which the reviewer described as \"a society beef (or pork if you like)\" in the style of folk singer Roy Harper. Writing in \"Rolling Stone\", Jann Wenner considered the song to be \"an amazing choice to follow 'Blackbird'\", given the contrast between the two pieces – \"'Blackbird' so encouraging, 'Piggies' so smug (though accurate: 'what they need's a damn good whacking'). Ha!\" Wenner paired it with Starr's \"Don't Pass Me By\", as lesser tracks beside the \"superb numbers\" found elsewhere on the album, but added that \"on their own, they're totally groovy.\" Alan Smith of the \"NME\" praised the melody and the use of classical instrumentation, and described the song as \"a telling piece about modern life\" and \"a fascinating piece of humorous cynicism\".<ref name=\"Smith/NME\"></ref>\n\nMusician and cult leader Charles Manson interpreted several songs on \"The Beatles\" as an inducement for his followers, known as the Manson Family, to carry out a series of murders in Los Angeles in August 1969. Inspired by the line \"What they need's a damn good whacking\", Manson adopted \"Piggies\" as one of the tracks to justify such attacks on the White bourgeoisie. Believing that the Beatles were instructing him through their music, Manson envisioned these attacks as the prelude to an apocalyptic racial war between the establishment and the Black community that would leave him and his followers to rule America on counterculture principles. At the scenes of the murders of Sharon Tate, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, Gary Hinman and others, the words \"Political Piggy\", \"Pig\" and \"Death to Pigs\" were written on the walls with the victims' blood. In the case of Leno LaBianca, items of cutlery were inserted into his body in reference to the lyric \"Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon\".\nSpeaking to \"Rolling Stone\" co-founder David Dalton before his trial, Manson also drew parallels between the pig noises that close the track and a similar sound, followed by machine-gun fire, that appears in Lennon's White Album sound collage \"Revolution 9\".<ref name=\"Dalton/Gadfly\"></ref><ref name=\"Dalton/RS\"></ref> Like its rival counterculture publications \"Los Angeles Free Press\" and \"Tuesday's Child\", \"Rolling Stone\" initially supported Manson, Dalton contending that it was a case of the conservative-minded authorities framing \"some poor hippie guru\". According to author Steve Turner, \"Piggies\" \"became notorious\" as a result of the Manson Family's 1971 murder trial, which was successfully prosecuted by Californian attorney Vincent Bugliosi.\n\nHarrison was appalled at Manson's interpretation of the song. He also found it disturbing that Manson came to define the long-haired hippie type in the public's eyes, after the prosecution's case had resulted in widespread condemnation of rock music and the idealism associated with the late 1960s hippie movement. In his 1974 book \"Helter Skelter\", Bugliosi says he was denied permission to quote from the lyrics of \"Piggies\" in the book, yet not so for relevant Lennon–McCartney songs, such as \"Helter Skelter\", \"Revolution 1\" and \"Blackbird\".\n\nWriting in 1977, Nicholas Schaffner said that, despite the \"merciless stereotypes\" presented in its lyrics, \"Piggies\" and Harrison's three other White Album compositions \"firmly established him as a contender\" beside the Beatles' principal songwriters, Lennon and McCartney. Four years later, Philip Norman described the song as \"mordantly humorous\". Among more recent Beatles biographers, Ian MacDonald views \"Piggies\" as a \"bludgeoning satire on straight society\", dismissing it as \"dreadful\" and \"an embarrassing blot on [Harrison's] discography\".\n\nAccording to author Doyle Greene, writing in his 2016 book on the 1960s counterculture, the Beatles and Manson are \"permanently connected in pop-culture consciousness\" as a result of Manson having founded his theory of race war on McCartney's \"Helter Skelter\", \"Piggies\" and other tracks from the 1968 double album. In his book \"Revolution: The Making of the Beatles' White Album\", David Quantick recognises the song's musical qualities – describing it as \"a powerful song, full of angry climaxes\" with \"a fine [vocal] performance ... [and] a charming baroque feel\" – yet he bemoans its \"arrogant\" and misanthropic message. Quantick concludes: \"Although the Beatles preached peace and love and meant it, large parts of the White Album indicate that they could be a bit selective about it.\" Ian Inglis considers that the intentions behind Harrison's send-up of capitalist consumerism were reasonable, and acknowledges the sinister connotations that the song gained through Manson. He says that the track fails, however, melodically and lyrically, and lacks cohesion in its musical arrangement as well as \"any subtlety or charm\".\n\nReviewing Harrison's career in a 2002 issue of \"Goldmine\" magazine, Dave Thompson termed \"Piggies\" \"whimsically foreboding\" and grouped it with late-period Beatles songs such as \"Something\" and \"Long, Long, Long\" that anticipated Harrison's successes as a solo artist after the group's break-up in 1970. Tim Riley describes the song's narrative as \"smug anti-elitism outdone only by the dourness of John's 'Glass Onion' and 'Sexy Sadie'\". With regard to George Martin's contention that \"The Beatles\" should have been edited down to a single disc, however, he views \"Piggies\" as one of the White Album \"essentials\" contributed by Harrison, along with \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Savoy Truffle\".\n\nAmong reviewers of the 2009 remastered album, Sean Highkin of Beats Per Minute cites the track as evidence that, despite the disharmonious atmosphere within the group during 1968, \"All four Beatles were working at their highest levels\", with Harrison \"at his most acerbic on 'Piggies'\". Mark Richardson of Pitchfork Media highlights the song as one of \"The Beatles\" \"iffy jokes\" that nevertheless succeed, due to the high standard of the band's songwriting and the effective sequencing of the double album. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, Jacob Stolworthy of \"The Independent\" listed \"Piggies\" at number 14 in his ranking of the White Album's 30 tracks. He admired the harpsichord passage as a \"highlight\" of the album and wrote: \"On first listen, 'Piggies' is too strange to enjoy. Once its Orwellian nature is embraced, however, it becomes a joyous two fingers in the face of establishment told by Harrison in baroque pop form.\"\n\nTheo Bikel, an actor, folk singer and activist who was a delegate at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, covered \"Piggies\" on his 1969 album \"A New Day\". Reviewing the opening night of Bikel's residency at the Troubadour in Los Angeles, in June 1970, \"Billboard\" magazine described the song as one of \"the more meaningful titles\" that the singer had adopted from the work of popular acts such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Donovan. The 1976 television adaptation of Vincent Bugliosi's book, also titled \"Helter Skelter\", features several Beatles songs, including \"Piggies\" and Harrison's White Album track \"Long, Long, Long\", both performed by the group Silverspoon. The song was also covered by Danbert Nobacon, lead singer of the anarcho-punk band Chumbawamba. Titled \"Piggies in Revolution 9\", Nobacon's version appeared on the 1989 album \"Fuck EMI\", a multi-artist compilation protesting EMI's business practices, particularly the company's involvement in cruise missile production.\n\nHaving become available on bootleg albums from 1991 onwards, Harrison's 1968 demo was released on the Beatles' \"Anthology 3\" compilation in October 1996. Recorded on an Ampex four-track recorder, the demo features Harrison playing two acoustic guitar parts, and a double-tracked lead vocal. Harrison performed \"Piggies\" throughout his 1991 Japanese tour with Eric Clapton and at his Natural Law Party concert in London in April 1992. With synthesizers replicating the classical arrangement, a version recorded at the Tokyo Dome on 15 December 1991 appears on Harrison's \"Live in Japan\" double album.\n\nPhish included \"Piggies\" in their performance of \"The Beatles\" on Halloween 1994, which was released in 2002 as \"Live Phish Volume 13\". The harpsichord from the original Beatles recording was mashed with Jay-Z's \"Change Clothes\" for a track on Danger Mouse's \"The Grey Album\" in 2004. For the Beatles' 2006 remix album \"Love\", compiled by Martin and his son Giles, the harpsichord and cello parts were mixed into the ending of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nThe song was covered by Pumajaw for \"The White Album Recovered\", a CD distributed with the September 2008 issue of \"Mojo\" magazine. That same year, former Cars keyboardist Greg Hawkes issued a ukulele rendition on his album \"The Beatles Uke\".\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald:\n\nThe Beatles\n\nAdditional musicians\n\n"}
{"id": "2246698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246698", "title": "Rocky Raccoon", "text": "Rocky Raccoon\n\n\"Rocky Raccoon\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 double album \"The Beatles\" (also known as the \"White Album\"). It was primarily written by Paul McCartney, although credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. McCartney began writing the song in Rishikesh, India, where the Beatles were studying Transcendental Meditation in the early months of 1968. John Lennon and Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan, who joined the Beatles on their retreat, also made contributions to the song. The Marvel Comics character Rocket Raccoon, created by Bill Mantlo and Keith Giffen, was inspired by the song's title and some of the lyrics.\n\nThe song, a country ballad, is titled from the character's name, which was originally \"Rocky Sassoon\", but McCartney changed it to \"Rocky Raccoon\" because he thought \"it sounded more like a cowboy\". Former 13th Floor Elevators drummer Danny Thomas claims the name \"Rocky\" was inspired by Roky Erickson, the American rock band's then vocalist and guitarist. The Old West-style honky-tonk piano was played by producer George Martin. \"Rocky Raccoon\" is also the last Beatles song to feature John Lennon's harmonica playing. \n\nThe lyrics describe a conflict over a love triangle, in which Rocky's girlfriend Lil Magill (known to the public as Nancy) leaves him for a man named Dan, who punches Rocky in the eye. Rocky vows revenge and takes a room at the saloon in the town where Dan and Nancy are staying. He bursts into Dan's room, armed with a gun, but Dan out-draws and shoots him. A drunken doctor attends to Rocky, the latter insisting that the wound is only a minor one. Stumbling back to his room, Rocky finds a Gideon Bible and takes it as a sign from God.\n\nDuring take 8 of the song (featured on \"Anthology 3\"), McCartney flubbed the line \"stinking of gin\", singing \"sminking\" instead (presumably confusing the words \"smelling\" and \"stinking\"). This caused him to laugh, exclaim \"Sminking?!\" and make up the remaining lines in the song. This take also has a noticeably different spoken-word introduction, with Rocky coming from \"a little town in Minnesota\", rather than the album version's \"somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota\", and McCartney's faux Western-American accent is more pronounced.\n\nIn \"Mojo\" magazine in October 2008, McCartney acknowledged that the style of the song is a pastiche, saying: \"I was basically spoofing the folksinger.\" Lennon attributed the song to McCartney, saying: \"Couldn't you guess? Would I have gone to all that trouble about Gideon's Bible and all that stuff?\"\n\nCoinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, Jacob Stolworthy of \"The Independent\" listed \"Rocky Raccoon\" at number 22 in his ranking of the White Album's 30 tracks. He called the song \"proof of McCartney's songwriting versatility\" and continued that the song is \"bolstered by a vibrant honky-tonk piano from the group's long-time record producer George Martin.\"\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald:\n\n\nRichie Havens, Ramsey Lewis, Jack Johnson, Andrew Gold, James Blunt, Phish, Jimmy Buffett, Maureen McGovern, Kingston Wall, Charlie Parr, and Andy Fairweather Low have recorded cover versions of this song. Folk/jazz artist Jessie Baylin covered the song on her 2009 concert tour. Steel Train have covered the song in the past. Phish covered the song as part of their 1994 Halloween musical costume, released on \"Live Phish Volume 13\".\n"}
{"id": "2246703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246703", "title": "Don't Pass Me By", "text": "Don't Pass Me By\n\n\"Don't Pass Me By\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 double album \"The Beatles\" (also known as the \"White Album\"). A country rock song, it was the first solo composition written by drummer Ringo Starr.\n\nThe song was released as a single in Scandinavia (albeit mis-credited to Lennon and McCartney) and peaked at number one in Denmark in April 1969.\n\nStarr first played the song for the other Beatles soon after he joined the group in August 1962. During an interview, Starr commented on the songwriting process, saying: \"I wrote Don't Pass Me By when I was sitting round at home. I was fiddling with the piano – I just bang away – and then if a melody comes and some words, I just have to keep going. It was great to get my first song down, one that I had written. It was a very exciting time for me and everyone was really helpful, and recording that crazy violinist was a thrilling moment.\"\n\nThe earliest public mention of the track seems to have been in a BBC chatter session introducing \"And I Love Her\" on the radio show \"Top Gear\" in 1964. In the conversation, Starr was asked if he had written a song and Paul McCartney mocked him soon afterwards, singing the first line of the refrain, \"Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue, baby.\"\n\nThe song was recorded in four separate sessions in 1968: 5 and 6 June, and 12 and 22 July. Despite references to it in 1964 as \"Don't Pass Me By\", it was called \"Ringo's Tune (Untitled)\" on 5 June session tape label and \"This Is Some Friendly\" on 6 June label. By 12 July, the title was restored.\n\nDuring a lead vocal track recorded on 6 June, Starr audibly counted out eight beats, and it can be heard in the released song starting at 2:30 of the 1987 CD version. The monaural mix is faster than the stereo mix, and features a different arrangement of violin in the fade-out.\n\nGeorge Martin arranged an orchestral interlude as an introduction, but this was rejected. It would eventually be used as an incidental cue for the Beatles' animated film \"Yellow Submarine\". In 1996, the introduction was released as the track \"A Beginning\" on \"Anthology 3\".\n\nAt the start of the Beatles' filmed rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios in January 1969, George Harrison, having recently visited Bob Dylan and the Band in Woodstock in upstate New York, reported to Starr and McCartney that \"Don't Pass Me By\" was the Band's favourite track on the White Album. He added that the song's country mood was \"their scene completely\" and told Starr, \"You'd go down a bomb with them.\"\n\nAmong contemporary reviews of \"The Beatles\", \"Record Mirror\" said that \"Don't Pass Me By\" had a \"carnival atmosphere\" and a \"'gay Paree' sound\", adding that, with Starr's vocal, the track was \"very appealing\". Writing for the same publication in January 1969, however, David Griffiths said that although he considered \"The Beatles\" to be the best album of the past year, the song's arrangement \"has quickly palled on me\" and \"I do tend to jump the needle here.\" Barry Miles of \"International Times\" described \"Don't Pass Me By\" as \"Ringo's C&W number\" and a \"great song\", and highlighted the \"excellent fiddle player\" and \"bag-pipe effect\". In his review for \"The New York Times\", Nik Cohn recognised the track as \"the Beatles five years back, straight ahead and clumsy and greatly enjoyable, backed by a beautiful hurdy-gurdy organ and made perfect by Ringo's own vocal, sleepwalking as ever\".\n\nWriting in 2014, Ian Fortnam of \"Classic Rock\" magazine cited \"Don't Pass Me By\" as one of the four songs that made the Beatles' White Album an \"enduring blueprint for rock\", along with \"Yer Blues\", \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Helter Skelter\", in that together they contained \"every one of rock's key ingredients\". In the case of Starr's song, he said that the track was poorly served by the McCartney-led arrangement, yet it represented a \"southern rock exemplar par excellence\" for musicians to come.<ref name=\"Fortnam/CR\"></ref>\n\nCoinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, Jacob Stolworthy of \"The Independent\" listed \"Don't Pass Me By\" at number 26 in his ranking of the White Album's 30 tracks. He wrote: \"This country ditty from Ringo was written years before the White Album, and – while suitably thigh-slapping – doesn’t ever outlive its making-up-the-numbers status.\"\n\nThe pianos were both recorded into a Leslie 147 speaker.\n\n\"Don't Pass Me By\" has been covered by the alt-country band the Gourds, by the Southern rock band the Georgia Satellites on their 1988 album \"Open All Night\", and by the Punkles on their 2004 album \"Pistol\". Fortnam highlights the Georgia Satellites' recording as a version that successfully captured the \"full boogie-rocking potential\" that had been ignored in the Beatles' guitar-less arrangement in 1968.\n\nThe Swedish pop group ABBA made an unofficial parody of this song, but it was not released until their medley \"Undeleted\" in 1994. Phish covered \"Don't Pass Me By\" live as part of their interpretation of \"The Beatles\", released on the album \"Live Phish Volume 13\", giving the song a bluegrass arrangement.\n\nRingo Starr released a re-recording of the song as a bonus track on his 2017 album \"Give More Love\".\n\n"}

It is found growing at altitudes of , in the island's recovering chaparral and woodlands habitats.\n\n\"Cupressus guadalupensis\" has previously been listed as being the same species as \"Cupressus forbesii\", which had been listed as a variety of \"C. guadalupensis\" in the past. Recent analysis, however, has placed \"C. forbesii\" as a separate, albeit closely related, species.\n\n\"Cupressus guadalupensis\" is an evergreen conifer tree with a conic to ovoid-conic crown, variable in size, with mature trees reaching tall. The foliage grows in dense sprays, dark green to gray-green in color. The leaves are scale-like, 2–5 mm long, and produced on rounded (not flattened) shoots.\n\nThe seed cones are spherical to oblong, 12–35 mm long, with 6 to 10 scales, green at first, maturing gray-brown to gray about 20–24 months after pollination. The cones remain closed for many years, only opening after the parent tree is killed in a wildfire, thereby allowing the seeds to colonise the bare ground exposed by the fire. The male cones are 3–5 mm long, and release pollen in February–March. A specimen survived at Cistus Nursery outside of Portland, OR during the winter of 2013-14, where temperatures went to -11.1111 Celsius.\n\nGuadalupe Island had a population of numerous but old and weak trees in 2000. As a viable conifer woodland species they disappeared rapidly from the late 19th century onwards, as hordes of introduced feral goats ate the seedlings that germinated for over a century. One major subpopulation was destroyed entirely, and the isolated stands were nearly destroyed. Also, with the animals destroying most vegetation, and especially the island's cloud forest, the water table dropped, further jeopardizing the remaining two main subpopulations.\n\nThe principal habitats were fenced in by 2001, and long-awaited removal of goats was effectively completed by 2005. The first young plants in 150 years or so are now able to grow and mature without being grazed away. The present small population of 100 extant trees are vulnerable to long term viability. It appears this cypress is more vulnerable to drought than other island native plants, such as the Guadalupe variety of Monterey Pine (\"Pinus radiata\" var. \"binata\"), and so the population could decline further with future climate changes. Habitat and watershed restoration and support projects are ongoing by Mexican conservation organization programs.\n\n\"Cupressus guadalupensis\" is considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN.\n\n\n"}

Short and simple, it was written and sung by Paul McCartney, but credited to Lennon–McCartney. At 1:42, \"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\" comprises 34 bars of a twelve-bar blues idiom. It begins with three different percussion elements (a hand banging on the back of an acoustic guitar, handclaps, and drums) and features McCartney's increasingly raucous vocal repeating a simple lyric with only two different lines.\n\nMcCartney wrote the song after seeing two monkeys copulating in the street while on retreat in Rishikesh, India, with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He marvelled in the simplicity of this natural scenario when compared to the emotional turmoil of human relationships. He later said:\nOn 9 October 1968, while John Lennon and George Harrison were working on two other songs for the album, McCartney recorded five takes of the song in Studio One at EMI Studios. Unlike its heavy blues result, the song began as an acoustic guitar number with McCartney alternating by verse between gentle and strident vocal styles. On this first night, McCartney played all the instruments himself. This version of the song can be found on the Beatles' \"Anthology 3\".\n\nOn 10 October, McCartney and Ringo Starr finished the song, Starr adding drums and handclaps, McCartney adding more vocals, bass guitar, and lead guitar. Lennon and Harrison were again occupied, supervising string overdubs for \"Piggies\" and \"Glass Onion\".\n\nUpon learning about the recording, Lennon was unhappy that McCartney recorded the song without him. In his 1980 interview with \"Playboy\", he was asked about it:\n\n\"Julia\" was recorded four days after the first session for \"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?,\" and is a solo performance by Lennon (double-tracked lead vocals and acoustic guitar), though McCartney was present for the recording, as he can be heard talking to Lennon from the control room after a take on the Beatles' \"Anthology 3\".\n\nIn a 1981 conversation with Hunter Davies, who had written a biography of the Beatles in 1968, McCartney responded to a Yoko Ono interview where she said McCartney had hurt Lennon more than anyone else, by saying, \"No one ever goes on about the times John hurt \"me\" ... Could I have hurt him more than the person who ran down his mother in his car?\" He then brought up Lennon's comments about \"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\": \"There's only one incident I can think of that John has mentioned publicly. It was when I went off with Ringo and did 'Why Don't We Do It in the Road'. It wasn't a deliberate thing. John and George were tied up finishing something and me and Ringo were free, just hanging around, so I said to Ringo, 'Let's go and do this.'\"\n\nMcCartney also expressed some lingering resentment about a similar incident with \"Revolution 9\", recorded in June 1968, a few months before \"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\": \"Anyway, he did the same with 'Revolution 9'. He went off and made that without me. No one ever says that. John is the nice guy and I'm the bastard. It gets repeated all the time.\"\n\nCoinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, Jacob Stolworthy of \"The Independent\" listed \"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\" at number 27 in his ranking of the White Album's 30 tracks. He wrote: \"Essentially a Paul McCartney track song (he recorded it alone) and as good a song inspired by the sight of two monkeys having sex on a street in India could ever be.\"\n\nThe song was recorded by Lowell Fulson, an American blues singer, in 1969 on the Jewel label. Fulson's version included the lyrics \"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\" “No one will be watching us” from the original, along with \"Why Don't We Do It in the car?\" and other lines not in the Beatles version. The Fulson recording credits Lennon and McCartney as writers and was featured on the soundtrack of the 2007 film American Gangster.\n\nPersonnel per Ian MacDonald\n\n"}
{"id": "2246724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246724", "title": "I Will", "text": "I Will\n\n\"I Will\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, from their 1968 double album \"The Beatles\" (also known as \"the White Album\"). It was written by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon–McCartney) and features him on lead vocal, guitar, and \"vocal bass\".\n\n\"I Will\" was one of the songs composed by the Beatles and their associates while in Rishikesh, India. Although the music came together fairly easily, the words were worked on in India, and remained unfinished even as recording began back in London. McCartney recalled that while in Rishikesh he and Donovan had written a set of lyrics with a \"moon\" theme, but he found them inadequate and so replaced them with \"very simple words, straight love-song words\". Donovan could not recall writing any of the early lyrics for the song but said that he possibly assisted McCartney with the \"shape of the chords\", in keeping with the \"descending movements\" in his own melodies.\n\nMcCartney also commented on \"I Will\": \"It's still one of my favourite melodies that I've written. You just occasionally get lucky with a melody and it becomes rather complete and I think this is one of them; quite a complete tune.\"\n\nRecording for \"I Will\" took place at EMI Studios in London on 16 September 1968, with McCartney completing overdubs the following day. The basic track required 67 takes. George Harrison was not present at the session.\n\nDuring take 19, McCartney ad-libbed an untitled song. Referred to as \"Can you take me back?\", a 28-second segment of this ended up on side four of \"The Beatles\", at the end of \"Cry Baby Cry\", as what author Ian MacDonald described as \"a sinister introduction to 'Revolution 9'\".\n\nIn take 29, McCartney, as an ad-lib, sung \"won't\" in place of \"will\" during the first verse before John Lennon replies, \"Yes you will.\" McCartney chuckles after this ad-lib and then the song ends at this point. This take was included in the expanded box set of \"The Beatles\" released in 2018.\n\nApple Records released \"The Beatles\" on 22 November 1968, with \"I Will\" sequenced as the penultimate track on side two, between \"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\" and \"Julia\". In an interview for Radio Luxembourg to promote the release, McCartney emphasised the wide range of musical styles found on the double album. He said that \"I Will\" was a legacy of the Beatles having had to satisfy requests for styles such as rhumba during their pre-fame years in Hamburg.\n\nAuthor Jonathan Gould identifies \"I Will\" as an effective \"demure punchline\" to the sexual suggestiveness of \"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\", and similar in mood and form to McCartney's 1966 song \"Here, There and Everywhere\". He also views it as lacking in genuine emotion, however, due to the lyrics and musical arrangement, and concludes: \"This is one of the few instances in which the restraint Paul typically brought to his ballad singing blanches into something that sounds like simple indifference. 'Who knows how long I've loved you?' he asks, and it's tempting to think, 'Who cares?'\" Howard Sounes welcomes the diversification of McCartney's non-rock White Album contributions such as \"Martha My Dear\" and \"Honey Pie\" but he says of \"I Will\": \"[It] exemplified Paul's weakness for the soft-centred love song. The melody was catchy, but the lyric, about loving his beloved forever and ever, etc., was the sickliest cliché, a taste of what was to come.\"\n\nCoinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, Jacob Stolworthy of \"The Independent\" listed \"I Will\" at number 12 in his ranking of the White Album's 30 tracks. He called the song \"crystalline proof that no one can write a love song as effortlessly as McCartney\", adding that McCarney's selection of it among his personal favourites is a tough choice to argue with. The song was sung in the 1994 film \"Love Affair\", starring Annette Bening and Warren Beatty.\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald:\n\n\n"}

The song was written primarily by Paul McCartney, and credited to Lennon–McCartney. It was inspired by a lecture given by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi while the Beatles were in India. The same lecture inspired Lennon's song \"Child of Nature\", the tune of which he later re-used for \"Jealous Guy\". Although credited to the group, the song was performed by McCartney alone (with a brass arrangement by George Martin), while the other Beatles were working on other \"White Album\" songs.\n\nAccording to Paul McCartney he was inspired by Nat King Cole's song \"Nature Boy\" he heard growing up. He wrote the song in Liverpool when he visited his father.\n\nMcCartney recorded the song during the height of the tensions that marred the sessions for the White Album. On 9 August 1968, he recorded 25 takes singing and playing acoustic guitar simultaneously. Take 24 was perceived to be the best (take 2 later appeared on \"Anthology 3\"). McCartney recorded overdubs of timpani, another guitar, and drums on 20 August, when George Martin's orchestral contributions were also added. The drums were put halfway down an uncarpeted corridor with the microphones at the far end, resulting in a bongo-like staccato sound. John Lennon did not play on the recording, but McCartney said he contributed some words to the song in India.

{"id": "2246738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246738", "title": "WTOC-TV", "text": "WTOC-TV\n\nWTOC-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 11, is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Savannah, Georgia, United States, serving southeastern Georgia's Coastal Empire and southern South Carolina's Lowcountry. The station is owned by Gray Television. WTOC-TV's studios are located off Chatham Center Drive in Savannah's Chatham Parkway section, and its transmitter is located along Fort Argyle Road/SR 204 in unincorporated Chatham County. On cable, the station is available on Comcast Xfinity channel 6 and Charter Spectrum channel 11.\n\nOn October 15, 1929, WTOC radio (1290 AM) signed on as the first radio station in the Savannah area. It was an enterprise of civic group Junior Board of Trade that was the forerunner of the Savannah Jaycees. It was later purchased by William Knight, Jr., who eventually added an FM station in 1946. \n\nOn February 14, 1954, Knight took a great financial risk and established WTOC-TV as the first television station in the Savannah area. WTOC-AM-FM had long been the area's CBS Radio affiliate, so WTOC-TV joined CBS and has been with the network ever since. It carried programming from all four networks for two years until WSAV-TV (channel 3) signed-on in 1956 and took the NBC affiliation. WTOC-TV then shared ABC with WSAV-TV until WJCL-TV (channel 22) signed-on in 1970. \n\nChannel 11 originally operated from studios on Abercorn Street in downtown Savannah. A self-supporting triangle-shaped tower was perched atop the studio. In 1957, WTOC activated its current tower along Fort Argyle Road in southwestern Chatham County. This significantly increased its coverage area. The original tower is still used as a backup to this day, and is a landmark of the downtown area. \n\nKnight sold WTOC-AM-FM-TV to AFLAC in 1979. That company sold off the radio stations with the AM station becoming WTKS and the FM station WQBT. In 1996, AFLAC sold its entire television group, including WTOC, to a group headed by Retirement Systems of Alabama which merged it with Ellis Communications to form Raycom Media. As a condition of the AFLAC-Ellis broadcast merger, Raycom had to sell off WSAV, which Ellis had just bought a year earlier. This situation arose because the FCC did not permit duopolies at the time; this rule was partially repealed in 2000 with a caveat that a duopoly is possible with at least eight full-power stations owned by different companies, but cannot consist of two of the four highest-rated stations in the market. In addition, Savannah had only six full-power television stations at the time, which was too few to accommodate a duopoly.\n\nIn 1995, it moved to new facilities (known as \"The News Place\") on the west side of Savannah at Chatham Parkway in 1995. Since that time, the downtown building has become offices for the President of Savannah College of Art and Design. \n\nA station editorial, a rarity on many American television stations since the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine, continues to be presented by WTOC General Manager Larry Silbermann after the 6 p.m. newscast usually every two weeks. Silbermann's viewpoints are very conservative in nature. While WTOC's regular mail and website address are offered after each of these editorials, counterpoint responses by other parties are never offered on-air.\n\nOn June 25, 2018, Atlanta-based Gray Television announced it had reached an agreement with Raycom to merge their respective broadcasting assets (consisting of Raycom's 63 existing owned-and/or-operated television stations, including WTOC-TV), and Gray's 93 television stations) under the former's corporate umbrella. The cash-and-stock merger transaction valued at $3.6 billion – in which Gray shareholders would acquire preferred stock currently held by Raycom – will result in WTOC becoming a sister station to CBS/NBC affiliate WRDW-TV and WAGT-CD in Augusta (while separating it from WFXG). The sale was approved on December 20 and completed on January 2, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWTOC-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 15 to VHF channel 11 for post-transition operations.\n\nWTOC has led the local Nielsen ratings in Savannah for most of the time since records have been kept. While WSAV and WJCL made a serious threat in the 1970s, WTOC has won every timeslot since 1980, often garnering more viewers than its rivals combined. Its dominance is so absolute that the station currently calls its newscasts simply \"\"The\" News\". WTOC airs more than seven hours of news a day, a considerable amount for a station in the 97th market and far more than any other station in Savannah. WTOC is the only station in Savannah to air a midday newscast. On August 24, 2015, WTOC introduced the market's first 7:00 p.m. newscast.\n\nThe station won both Emmy and Edward R. Murrow awards for news gathering efforts in 2003. In addition, the station pulled in eleven Georgia Associated Press Awards in 2004. In 2005, Chris Clark won an Emmy for his football special and an Edward R. Murrow award for his story about a high school football player. In 2006, an Emmy was awarded to Mike Manhattan and Zach Powers for Freedom Fighters, a story about 3rd Infantry Division soldiers in Iraq. In 2007, Zach Powers, Alex Monarch, and Chris Clark won an Emmy for editing a special series on Rosa Parks. The same year, Chris Clark won the Emmy for best sports reporter.\n\nOn October 10, 2010, WTOC became the second station in Savannah to begin broadcasting news in high definition. Its half-hour weekday afternoon show at 4 is streamed live online. Since network programming can sometimes preempt the 6 o'clock hour on Saturdays, WTOC also airs a newscast at 7. The station operates its own weather radar (known as \"Doppler Max 11\") at its studios.\n\nOn September 26, 2011, sister outlet Fox affiliate WFXG in Augusta launched its first ever in-house news operation. In partnership with a News Director based at WTOC in Savannah, WFXG hired multimedia journalists to shoot, edit, and report coverage in the Augusta area. At this point, five personalities have joined that station and work out of WFXG's facility. All anchors for news, weather and sports are provided by WTOC and the nightly prime time broadcast at 10 originates live from this station's studios.\n\nWTOC broadcasts \"CBS This Morning\" on a one-hour delay, unlike other CBS stations in the Eastern Time Zone, instead airing an extended version of \"\"The\" News at Daybreak\".\n\nIn Georgia, WTOC is carried in Brunswick in the Jacksonville DMA. It also covers Wheeler and Treutlen counties in the Macon DMA as well as Emanuel and Jenkins counties in the Augusta DMA.\n\n"}

The song was written by John Lennon and credited to Lennon–McCartney.\n\n\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey\" was written about Lennon's future wife, Yoko Ono. Lennon said of the song:\n\nMany listeners, including Paul McCartney, believed that the song was about heroin, as the term \"monkey\" is often associated with the drug. Although Lennon and Ono used the drug, McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr did not, with McCartney later saying, \"It was a harder terminology, which the rest of us weren't into.\"\n\nLennon's working title for the composition was \"Come on, Come on\". An Esher Demo of the song, recorded in George Harrison's Esher home in May 1968, features all-acoustic instrumentation, and a vocal sung in a more Bob Dylan-like spoken word style than the released version.\n\n\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey\" evolved from a jam session and was originally untitled. The final mix was sped up by mixing the tape running at 43 hertz instead of the usual 50. According to Harrison, the title came from one of the Maharishi's sayings (with \"and my monkey\" added later).\n\nThe released version of the song was recorded at EMI Studios on 27 June 1968, and an overdub session on 1 July. Final stereo mixing was completed on 12 October.\n\nIn 2018, the music staff of \"Time Out London\" ranked it at number 13 on their list of the best Beatles songs.\n\nHowever, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, Jacob Stolworthy of \"The Independent\" listed \"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey\" at number 21 in his ranking of the White Album's 30 tracks. He wrote of the song: \"With its jangly guitar riff, repetitive lyrics and frantic bass line, this song – borne from the growing unease with Yoko Ono's presence in the studio – grows more fun with each listen.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2246741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246741", "title": "Malkuth", "text": "Malkuth\n\nMalkuth (; Modern: Ashkenazi: , 'kingdom'), Malchut or Malchus is the tenth of the sephirot in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It sits at the bottom of the Tree, below Yesod. This sephirah has as a symbol the Bride which relates to the sphere of Tipheret, symbolized by the Bridegroom.\n\nUnlike the other nine sephirot, it is an attribute of God which does not emanate from God directly. Rather it emanates from God's creation—when that creation reflects and evinces God's glory from within itself. The word can be translated or identified as positive communication, royalty/kingly dynasty, or humility.\n\nMalkuth means Kingdom. It is associated with the realm of matter/earth and relates to the physical world, the planets and the solar system. It is important not to think of this Sephirah as \"unspiritual\". Even though Malkuth is the emanation \"furthest\" from the Divine Source, it is still on the Tree of Life and therefore has its own unique spiritual qualities. It is often said, Kether (the \"highest\" Sephira) is in Malkuth and Malkuth is in Kether. As the receiving sphere of all the other Sephiroth, Malkuth gives tangible form to the other emanations. The Divine energy comes down and finds its expression in this plane, and our purpose as human beings is to bring that energy back around the circuit again and back up the Tree.\n\nSome occultists have also likened Malkuth to a cosmic filter, as it lies above the world of the Qliphoth, or the Tree of Death. The Qliphoth, being the world of chaos, is constructed from the imbalance of the original Sephirot in the Tree of Life. For this reason Malkuth is associated with the feet and anus of the human body, the feet connecting the body to Earth, and the anus being the body's \"filter\" through which waste is excreted, just as Malkuth excretes unbalanced energy into the Qliphoth. Another way to understand this is that when one is sitting, as in a meditative state, it is the anus that makes physical contact with the Earth, whereas when one is standing or walking, it is the feet that come in contact with the Earth.\n\nMalkuth is also associated with the World of Assiah, the material plane, and the \"densest\" of the Four Worlds of the Kabbalah. Because of this relation to Assiah, it is also related to the suit of Pentacles or Coins of the Tarot. Through Assiah, Malkuth is also related to the four Page cards in the Tarot as well. There is also a connection between Malkuth and the tenth card of each suit in Tarot as Malkuth is the tenth sephiroth. In the modern set of playing cards, Malkuth is related to the Suit of Diamonds' symbolizing material wealth, or the treasures found in the physical world. Malkuths association with the Page cards of the Tarot is reflected in the modern playing card deck as the Jacks of the deck. As Malkuth is directly associated with Assiah, Malkuth also represents the second He (ה) in the Tetragrammaton (יהוה), and is associated with the classical element of Earth. \n\nThe Names of God associated with Malkuth are Adonai Melekh and Adonai ha-Arets. The Archangel of this sphere is Sandalphon. The Ishim (Souls of Fire) is the Angelic order associated with Malkuth, and the planetary/astrological correspondence of Malkuth is the Earth. The Qliphah of Malkuth is represented by the demonic order \"Nehemoth\", ruled by the Archdemon Naamah. Symbols associated with this sphere are a Bride (a young woman on a throne with a veil over her face) and a double cubed altar. Where Binah is known as the Superior Mother, Malkuth is referred to as the Inferior Mother. It is also referred to as the Bride of Microprosopos, where the Macroprosopos is Kether.\n\nFrom a Christian viewpoint this sphere is important since Jesus preached that people should \"seek first the Kingdom of God\". In some systems, it is equated with Da'at, knowledge in the sense of Gnosis, the invisible sephirah. In comparison with Eastern systems, Malkuth is a very similar archetypal idea to that of the Muladhara chakra. In Shakta Tantra, which is also associated with the Earth, this is the plane in which karma is expressed.\n\nAlthough Malkuth is seen as the \"lowest\" Sephiroth on the tree of life, it also contains within it the potential to reach the highest. This is exemplified in the Hermetic maxim 'As above so below', and \"Kether is in Malkuth, and Malkuth is in Kether\".\n\nDavid Bowie's \"\"Station to Station\" references the concept in the line \"Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth/There are you, you drive like a demon from station to station.\" \n\nSwiss metal band Samael have released a song titled \"From Malkuth to Kether\" on their \"Exodus\" EP.\n"}

Kim won 45.3% of the popular vote but narrowly lost to Park's 53.2%, by about 900,000 votes. Following the election, Kim was involved in a car accident which left him with a permanent injury on his hip joint. Believing the accident to be an attempt on his life, Kim fled to Japan where he eventually began an exile movement for democracy in South Korea, following Seoul's declaration of the Yushin Constitution in October 1972. With widespread allegations of corruption and manipulation of the results, Park turned his regime into a military dictatorship.\n\nAround noon of August 8, 1973, Kim was attending a meeting with the leader of the Democratic Unification Party held in the Room 2212 of the Hotel Grand Palace in Tokyo. At around 13:19, Kim was abducted by a group of unidentified agents as he walked out of the room after the meeting. The entire rest of the floor of that hotel was rumored to have been rented out by a notorious yakuza syndicate run by the South Korean national Machii Hisayuki, a man long known to have extensive ties to the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA). He was then taken into the empty Room 2210 where he was drugged and fell unconscious. Kim was later moved to Osaka and later to Seoul, South Korea.\n\nKim was later quoted as saying that a weight had been attached to his feet aboard the boat heading toward Korea, indicating that the kidnappers had intended to drown him by throwing him into the sea. They were, however, forced to abandon this plan as the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force began a pursuit of the kidnappers' boat, and they fired an illuminating shell just when the kidnappers brought Kim on the deck. Subsequently Kim was released in Busan. He was found alive at his house in Seoul five days after the kidnapping.\n\nAccording to some reports, Kim was only saved when U.S. Ambassador Philip Habib found out the KCIA was involved and intervened with the South Korean government.\n\nOn October 24, 2007, following an internal inquiry, South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) has admitted that its precursor, the KCIA, undertook the kidnapping, saying it had at least tacit backing from then-leader Park Chung-hee.\n\nThe film \"KT\" (2002) depicts the kidnapping of Kim Dae-jung.\n\n"}

The song was written by John Lennon in India and credited to Lennon–McCartney. Lennon wrote the song during the Beatles' stay in India in response to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's alleged sexual advance on actress Mia Farrow.\n\nLennon originally wanted to title the song \"Maharishi\", but changed the title to \"Sexy Sadie\" at George Harrison's request. Lennon was disillusioned after Maharishi Mahesh Yogi had allegedly made a sexual advance on Mia Farrow, who was attending the course the Maharishi was teaching at his ashram. (Harrison, Paul McCartney, and Cynthia Lennon later said that they thought the story, which had come from Alexis Mardas, had been fabricated.) Lennon once said of the song: \"That was inspired by Maharishi. I wrote it when we had our bags packed and were leaving. It was the last piece I wrote before I left India. I just called him 'Sexy Sadie' instead of (sings) 'Maharishi what have you done, you made a fool...' I was just using the situation to write a song, rather calculatingly but also to express what I felt. I was leaving the Maharishi with a bad taste. You know, it seems that my partings are always not as nice as I'd like them to be.\" He told \"Rolling Stone\" that when the Maharishi asked why he was leaving, he replied, \"Well, if you're so \"cosmic\", you'll know why.\"\n\nAfter returning from India, Lennon scratched the lyrics into a piece of wood, with the original title \"Maharishi\". According to Harrison's account in the director's cut of the \"Anthology\" film, the recorded version changed only after Harrison insisted that if the song was used its name must be changed and persuaded Lennon to retitle it \"Sexy Sadie\". Derek Taylor remembered Lennon's scratching the wood in the Apple offices. The wood ended up in Maureen Starkey's possession and was ultimately sold to a Beatles collector.\n\nAccording to Mark Lewisohn's \"The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions\", an early outtake of \"Sexy Sadie\" features Lennon demonstrating the song's original working lyrics to the rest of the band: \"Maharishi, you little twat/Who the fuck do you think you are?/Who the fuck do you think you are?/Oh, you cunt.\"\n\nThe song's instrumental fadeout was originally longer and featured a breakdown based around the middle eight. This was edited out before mixing.\n\nIn a 1968 \"Rolling Stone\" interview, Lennon complimented the song \"I've Been Good to You\" by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles. The Miracles song begins with the lines \"Look what you've done/You made a fool out of someone\", echoing \"Sexy Sadie\"'s \"What have you done?/You made a fool of everyone\".\n\nCoinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, Jacob Stolworthy of \"The Independent\" listed \"Sexy Sadie\" at number six in his ranking of the White Album's 30 tracks. He wrote of the song: \"To this day \"Sexy Sadie\" drips with bittersweet disdain, its moody final minute—inspiring Radiohead's \"Karma Police\" and \"Four Out of Five\" by Arctic Monkeys—managing to spring hairs on end, however many times you've heard it.\" Also in 2018, \"Time Out London\" ranked \"Sexy Sadie\" at number 14 on its list of the best Beatles songs.\n\n\n\nWhen \"Mojo\" released \"The White Album Recovered\" in 2008, part of a continuing series of CDs of Beatles albums covered track-by-track by modern artists, the track was covered by Rachel Unthank and the Winterset. The disc also featured a bonus track of the same song performed by Paul Weller.\n\nThe song was also covered by Anderson Paak on multi-instrumentalist and producer Kush Mody's first album \"Creature Comforts\".\n"}

(\"Dreyers\"), is a United States-based ice cream company with nearly 100 years of winning experience in the market. Dreyer’s was founded in 1928 in Oakland, California, where it’s present-day headquarter office remains. The company was sold by Nestle to Froneri International on February 1, 2020 for $4 billion. Dreyer's is home to a robust portfolio of powerhouse ice cream brands, including Häagen-Dazs, Outshine, Drumstick, and its namesake Dreyer's, among others.\n\nDreyer’s employs 2,500 employees across its four factories in Bakersfield, CA, Tulare, CA, Fort Wayne, IN, and Laurel, MD, it’s Distribution Center in Manteca, CA and it’s headquarter in Oakland, CA.\n\nThe two brand names honor the company's founders: Joseph Edy, a candy maker, and William Dreyer, an ice cream maker. Joseph Edy was born in Missouri and raised in Montana. Joseph Oliver Edy operated a homemade candy and ice cream parlor at 122 North Broadway in Billings, Montana during the 1910s. In the 1920s he and his wife Grace decided to join his brother in California. In 1925 Joseph Edy opened the doors to Edy's Character Candies Shop in Oakland. Edy's high-quality candy quickly became recognized as among the best in the East Bay Area, and Edy was soon operating six shops. William Dreyer also ran a business in the 1920s, an ice cream manufacturing venture in the California dairy country community of Visalia. In 1926 he was recruited to run a large new plant in Oakland for National Ice Cream. While in Oakland, he met Joe Edy.\n\nIn 1928 Edy and Dreyer decided to join forces to manufacture ice cream. They secured a small factory and launched Edy's Grand Ice Cream (the \"Grand\" reflected their street address on Grand Avenue in Oakland). They focused on creative innovations to fuel their small venture. For example, the two men used Joseph Edy's knowledge and expertise in candy-making to create the original Rocky Road ice cream, from a combination of flavors which Edy had previously invented. The chocolate, marshmallow, and nut flavor was named Rocky Road as a means of describing the ice cream's texture as well as the troubled economic times of the Great Depression. Edy and Dreyer are also credited with originating the Toasted Almond and Candy Mint flavors. At the time ice cream had limited flavors such as vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry, but Rocky Road, introduced in 1929, was one of the first combination of flavors. Because only large marshmallows were manufactured at the time, he used his wife's sewing scissors to cut marshmallows into bite-sized pieces to make the first batch of Rocky Road.\n\n\n\nIn 2002, Nestlé insisted on a smaller container to increase profits and so the standard US half gallon (2 quarts) container (1.89 L) was downsized to 1.75 quarts (1.65 L) container. In May 2008, the 1.75 quart container was further downsized to 1.5 quarts (1.42 L). Most other ice cream manufacturers, with the notable exception of Blue Bell, followed the downsizing move.\n\n"}

{"id": "2246768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246768", "title": "Long, Long, Long", "text": "Long, Long, Long\n\n\"Long, Long, Long\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 album \"The Beatles\" (also known as \"the White Album\"). It was written by George Harrison, the group's lead guitarist, while he and his bandmates were attending Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh, India, in early 1968. Although Harrison later stated that he was addressing God in the lyrics, it is the first of his compositions that invites interpretation as both a standard love song and a paean to his deity.\n\n\"Long, Long, Long\" originated during a period in which Harrison emerged as a prolific songwriter, coinciding with his return to the guitar after two years of studying the Indian sitar. He based the chord pattern on \"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\" by Bob Dylan, while the song's understated arrangement partly reflects the influence of the Band's 1968 album \"Music from Big Pink\". The Beatles recorded it in London towards the end of the White Album sessions, which were marked by acrimony among the band members in the fallout to their experiences in Rishikesh. An ambient and meditative ballad, it ends with a partly improvised segment that was inspired by the sound of a wine bottle vibrating on a speaker in the studio.\n\n\"Long, Long, Long\" has received praise from several music critics. On release, William Mann of \"The Times\" rated it the equal of the album's best Lennon–McCartney compositions; Ian MacDonald later described it as Harrison's \"touching token of exhausted, relieved reconciliation with God\" and his \"finest moment on \"The Beatles\"\". Elliott Smith and Jim James are among the other artists who have recorded or performed the song.\n\nGeorge Harrison began writing \"Long, Long, Long\" during the Beatles' stay in Rishikesh, India, between February and April 1968. It was one of many songs that marked Harrison's return to the guitar as his principal musical instrument, after he had dedicated himself to mastering the Indian sitar in 1966. This coincided with a new, prolific period in his songwriting, which musicologist Walter Everett likens to the arrival of John Lennon and Paul McCartney as composers in 1963.\n\nLed by Harrison's commitment, the four band members went to Rishikesh to study Transcendental Meditation there under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. They departed for England separately, however, between 1 March and 12 April, and their mixed experiences on the course contributed to the divisiveness that pervaded the group upon their return. Harrison continued to espouse the Maharishi's teachings; this position left him isolated within the band and represented an impediment to their unity that was unprecedented in the group's career. Author Simon Leng describes \"Long, Long, Long\" as the first song in which Harrison \"share[d] the spiritual refuge he'd found\" through meditation, as well as \"a confluence of the Indian, folk, and spiritual influences\" that had preoccupied him since 1966.\n\nDonovan, the Scottish singer-songwriter who joined in the Beatles' musical activities in Rishikesh, recalled that Harrison played both sitar and guitar at the ashram and was developing a style of music that became \"the finest spiritual sound\". Harrison completed the lyrics to \"Long, Long, Long\" in August that year, at which point the Beatles were part-way through the recording of their eponymous double album, also known as \"the White Album\". In his autobiography, \"I, Me, Mine\", he states that \"the 'you' in 'Long Long Long' is God.\" He also says that his musical inspiration for the composition was Bob Dylan's \"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\" – specifically, \"D to E minor, A and D – those three chords and the way they moved\". As a further influence in \"Long, Long, Long\", Leng cites the release of the Band's debut album, \"Music from Big Pink\", which \"signaled the rebirth of 'the song'\" as an alternative to the excesses of 1967-era psychedelia.\nAccording to musicologist Alan Pollack, \"Long, Long, Long\" is \"an off-beat mixture\" of contemporary musical styles; he identifies it as \"a three-way cross between jazz waltz, folk song, and late sixties psychedelia\". The song is in the key of F major, played with a capo on the guitar's third fret, so as to allow for the chord shapes that Harrison admired in \"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\". The melody appears to fluctuate from the home key, due to its avoidance of perfect cadences, as the dominant, C7 chord resists anchoring on the tonic I chord of F major. In addition, all plagal changes (in this case, B to F major) are fleeting. The composition also makes use of jazz-style ninth chords.\nLyrically, the song takes the form of a reconciliation with a loved one after a long period of estrangement. Theologian Dale Allison considers that, given the \"cryptic\" nature of the lyrics, it is only through Harrison's subsequent comments that the listener knows that he is addressing God rather than a woman. Allison likens the song's message to that of later Harrison compositions such as \"Try Some, Buy Some\" and \"Heading for the Light\", through its conveying of a \"conversion experience\".\n\nThe lyrics' reference to an extreme length of time is accentuated in the verses by the stretching out of a slow 6/8 metre into 9/8, and by the appending of a measure-long instrumental tag after each two bars of vocal melody. Partly as a result of the absence of resolution in the home key, the descending bassline in the verses – a 4–3–2–1 sequence of notes, mirroring the IV–iii–ii–I chord pattern – establishes an almost subliminal tonic.\n\nThe mood of the song is gentle and meditative, with the more strident middle eight providing a brief departure from the calmness. In this section, Harrison sings of \"So many tears I was searching / So many tears I was wasting\", a statement that, according to author Ian Inglis, reflects the singer's \"rejoicing in his discovery of a deity to guide him through the vicissitudes of life\". Everett remarks on the close similarity between \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\", as well as an understated musical mood akin to the Band's early work. The song's ending, which would come about through happenstance while the Beatles were working in the recording studio, is marked by Harrison playing a final, G minor 7 chord, which author Ian MacDonald considers \"one of the most resonant [chords] in The Beatles' discography\".\nThe working title for the song was \"It's Been a Long, Long, Long Time\". Recording began at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London on 7 October 1968, during the final week of sessions for the White Album. Since the start of the project, in late May, the album sessions had been fraught with disharmony, partly as a result of the constant presence of Yoko Ono, Lennon's new partner, and disagreements within the band over their new business venture, Apple Corps. While noting the context of the song's recording, MacDonald describes \"Long, Long, Long\" as Harrison's \"touching token of exhausted, relieved reconciliation with God\".\nThe recording session was a relaxed occasion; the burning of Indian incense helped to create the requisite atmosphere in the studio. The Beatles recorded 67 takes of the rhythm track, with Harrison on vocals and acoustic guitar, McCartney playing Hammond organ, and Ringo Starr on drums. The drum part includes a series of loud fills that serve as a commentary beside the vocal line, in the manner of Starr's playing on \"A Day in the Life\" in 1967. The idea for the end of the song was inspired by the sound created by a wine bottle sitting on a Leslie speaker, through which the organ was connected. Whenever McCartney played a certain note on the keyboard, the bottle began to vibrate, producing an eerie clattering sound that the Beatles decided to incorporate in their subsequent performances of the track. To compound the effect on the selected take, Starr played a fast snare drum roll and Harrison vocalised a prolonged, high-pitched wail. Chris Gerard of PopMatters comments on the \"palpable spiritual longing\" conveyed in the song and describes this coda as a \"weird spectral ending, with Harrison wailing like a wounded ghost while the band members rattle their instruments ominously\". In his book on the history of ambient music, Mark Prendergast cites the song as a ballad \"noteworthy for its Ambient production\".\n\nNine hours after this all-night session, the band returned to the studio to carry out overdubs. Harrison added a second vocal and a lead acoustic guitar part that Everett likens to a sitar due to the use of natural distortion. During the same session, McCartney overdubbed bass guitar. The recording was finished on 9 October, with the addition of a brief harmony vocal from McCartney and piano, over the middle eight, played by Chris Thomas. Everett describes this as a \"gospel piano\" part that complements the \"\"All Things Must Pass\"-style bridge\" – referring to Harrison's 1970 solo album.\n\nMixing on \"Long, Long, Long\" was completed on 14 October, with Starr's drum fills given prominence in the mix. Relative to the stereo version, the contrast between the song's quiet and louder moments is less pronounced in the mono mix, where Harrison's second vocal part also arrives earlier on the opening line.\n\nApple Records released \"The Beatles\" on 22 November 1968, with \"Long, Long, Long\" appearing as the final track on side three of the double LP. The sequencing ensured that the song provided what author Mark Hertsgaard terms \"a calm landing pad\" after McCartney's heavy rock-styled \"Helter Skelter\". Shortly after the album's release, Harrison spent time with Dylan and the Band in Woodstock, in upstate New York. In addition to co-writing \"I'd Have You Anytime\" with Dylan, Harrison further established his independence from the Beatles during this visit, which music critic John Harris views as the foundation for \"All Things Must Pass\".\n\nAmong contemporary reviews of \"The Beatles\", Alan Walsh of \"Melody Maker\" admired the song as \"a gentle, lilting track\" while, less impressed, \"Record Mirror\" considered it \"not a strong tune\", with drums \"monopolising the sound\". In his review for \"The Times\", William Mann described \"Long, Long, Long\" as \"a melting love song in slow waltz tempo\" and rated it the equal of the nine best, \"superbly inventive\" compositions credited to Lennon–McCartney.<ref name=\"Mann/Times\"></ref>\n\nRecalling the release in his 1977 book \"The Beatles Forever\", Nicholas Schaffner said that in departing from the overtly Indian style of his previous compositions for the Beatles, Harrison had provided \"a quartet of more conventionally accessible pop songs that many felt were among the finest on the [White Album]\". Schaffner remarked on Harrison's limitations as a singer compared with Lennon and McCartney before adding: \"but when he tones his voice down to an ethereal near-whisper, as in 'Long Long Long,' he can evoke as well as anyone the magic and the mystery of what [music journalist] Jonathan Cott has called 'the music of deep silence.'\" In \"Newsweek\"s mainly unfavourable review of \"The Beatles\", Hubert Saal concluded by saying that Harrison was the album's \"hero\" and that \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"Savoy Truffle\" were its best songs. He described the former as \"deceptively simple, beautifully melodic and explosively punctuated\".\n\nAllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine views \"Long, Long, Long\" as \"haunting\" and, along with its composer's three other White Album tracks – \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", \"Piggies\" and \"Savoy Truffle\" – evidence that Harrison's songwriting \"deserved wider exposure\" than his typical quota of two songs on each Beatles LP. Less impressed with Harrison's other contributions to the album, Ian MacDonald welcomes \"Long, Long, Long\" with the words: \"at last – the real George.\" MacDonald considers it to be \"Harrison's finest moment on \"The Beatles\": simple, direct, and, in its sighing, self-annihilating coda, devastatingly expressive\". Conversely, although he acknowledges its effectiveness in following \"Helter Skelter\", Tim Riley identifies \"Long, Long, Long\" as the weakest of the four Harrison songs, which are otherwise all \"essentials\" and \"regain[ed] the promise\" shown by his three compositions on the Beatles' \"Revolver\" album. Author Jonathan Gould praises the track as a \"dark beautiful ballad\" and a \"breakthrough\" for Harrison as a vocalist and composer, since it represents \"the first time he ever allowed himself to sound humbled by his emotions in a song\". Music critic Chris Ingham, writing for Rough Guides, similarly includes it among \"a new phase\" of Harrison compositions, along with \"Something\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\", in which \"warmth and sweetness\" replaced the dissonant qualities of his Indian-inspired melodies.\n\nWriting for \"Rolling Stone\" in 2002, Greg Kot deemed the song to be \"quintessential Harrison, summarizing the impending exhaustion of the Beatles and the era they defined, while pointing the way toward the spiritual heights achieved by his solo debut masterpiece, \"All Things Must Pass\"\". In his obituary of the former Beatle, for Rock's Backpages, Mat Snow included \"Long, Long, Long\" among his favourite Harrison compositions, saying: \"for my money the music of George Harrison is most compelling when dwelling in those strange shadows of elusive regret and longing, even fear ...\" David Quantick of \"Uncut\" admires it as \"a yearning, beautiful song\" and \"an oasis of calm and faith in the clattering chaos of the White Album\". He also considers the track to be \"arguably the least feted of the Beatles' great songs\".\n\n\"Long, Long, Long\" was ranked 80th in \"Mojo\"s 2006 list \"The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs\". In his commentary for the magazine, musician Colin Newman described it as \"achingly beautiful\" and \"like the album in microcosm ... [a] lament for a long-lost love which ends with a ghostly freakout\". In a similar list, in 2011, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked the song at number 98. Conversely, in 2012, readers of \"The Daily Telegraph\" voted \"Long, Long, Long\" as the fifth worst Beatles track. The following year, \"Mojo\" listed it at number 9 in a poll to determine \"the ultimate list of connoisseurs' Beatles' songs\", as defined by any track not included on the band's greatest-hits compilations \"1962–1966\" and \"1967–1970\".\n\nIn 1987, Daniel Amos vocalist Terry Scott Taylor recorded what \"Trouser Press\" admired as a \"first-rate cover\" of \"Long, Long, Long\" for his album \"A Briefing for the Ascent\". By contrast, Sean Carruthers of AllMusic considers singer Tom Hooper's 2002 cover to be a version that \"manages to drain the life\" out of the song. Elliott Smith included \"Long, Long, Long\" in his live performances. His biographer Benjamin Nugent writes that it appealed to Smith amid his struggles with depression and drug addiction, as \"a ballad about trying to get rid of self-imposed suffering and returning to a place where you can relate to other people\".\n\nA recording by Tanya Donelly appeared on her 2006 album \"This Hungry Life\" and later on the CD accompanying \"Uncut\"s feature article on Harrison's career, in the August 2008 issue of the magazine. My Morning Jacket lead singer Jim James opened his 2009 EP of Harrison compositions, \"Tribute To\", with \"Long, Long, Long\" – a cover that \"Drowned in Sound\" praised as \"not only the standout moment, but also one of the most beautiful and arresting songs of the year\". Having recorded the EP within days of Harrison's death in November 2001, James said he decided to release it eight years later partly as a result of attending the David Lynch Foundation's Transcendental Meditation awareness concert, \"Change Begins Within\", where \"George's name came up a lot ... his spirit was very big at that event.\"\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald:\n\n"}

The coda of the song is a short segment referred to as \"Can You Take Me Back\", written by Paul McCartney, which was actually an outtake from the \"I Will\" session.\n\nDemos indicate that Lennon composed the song in late 1967. The original lyrics were \"Cry baby cry, make your mother buy\". Lennon described to biographer Hunter Davies how he got the words from an advertisement. Some of the lyrics of the song are loosely based on the nursery rhyme \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\".\n\nEngineer Geoff Emerick resigned during the recording of \"Cry Baby Cry\", though his departure was precipitated by Lennon and McCartney's obsessions over the recording of both \"Revolution\" and \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\", respectively, and the overall tensions of the sessions. Emerick would not work with the Beatles again until the session for \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" nine months later.\n\nAfter a day-long rehearsal, on 16 July 1968 the basic tracks were laid down for Lennon's guitar part and his vocal on the introduction, McCartney's bass, and Starr's drums, along with Lennon's piano and George Martin's harmonium, while all other parts were dubbed in two days later: Lennon's lead vocal, Lennon/McCartney falsetto backing vocals and tambourines, Martin's harmonium introduction, sound effects for tea, and Harrison's guitar, a Gibson Les Paul borrowed from Eric Clapton and soon to be a permanent gift.\n\nThe song is followed on the album by an unrelated and unlisted track, ad libbed and sung by Paul McCartney. Though the song originally had no official name, it has popularly become known as \"Can You Take Me Back?\" after the primary lyric of the song, and has been officially deemed so on the track listing for the 50th anniversary edition of \"The Beatles\". The hidden track is an improvised jam recorded by McCartney during a 16 September 1968 session for \"I Will\".\n\nCoinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, Jacob Stolworthy of \"The Independent\" listed \"Cry Baby Cry\" at number 19 in his ranking of the White Album's 30 tracks. He wrote of the song: \"Lennon translated elements of the nursery rhyme \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\" for this effort, which comes with an added eerie McCartney segment titled \"Can You Take Me Back?\" He ultimately called the song, \"unremarkable, but remains easy listening.\"\n\nPer Ian MacDonald:\n\n\"Cry Baby Cry\"\n\n\"Can You Take Me Back?\" \n\n"}

It was formerly known by its German name, \"Bangis\", although this is no longer used.\n\nBefore 1150, when it came to the abbey of Saint-Maurice, Bagnes was owned by the Counts of Savoy. It remained under the abbey's authority until 1798, when it became part of the Entremont district. Verbier castle (also called the \"abbaye\") is first mentioned in 1287 in Le Châble and was presumably destroyed in 1476.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, the radicals and conservatives feuded violently in the villages. This led, in 1844, to the bloody battle of Corberaye, in which three conservatives were killed. The battle of Corberaye brought the radicals to power, but the conservatives were able gain support from political allies and were able to return to power shortly thereafter. One consequence of this political discord was the founding of the liberal-radical free school in 1900. At the free school there was no religious instruction, in contrast to the other village schools which had been founded by religious groups. The free school remained open until 1943.\n\nThe parish is first mentioned in 1178, with the parish church at St. Martin's church in Le Châble. The parsonage was built in 1686 at Verbier. It became a rectory in 1915 and a parish in 1962. Other chapels are located in Montagnier (14th century), Sarreyer (after 1639), Lourtier (1659), Vernays (1661), Media (1679), Champsec (1684) and Versegères (1684).\n\nThe municipality suffered from frequent natural disasters, especially from the floods of the Dranse in 1469, 1595 and a particularly devastating flood in 1818. There were silver mines in the area between 1344-1723 and again in 1852-55. In 1958 the Lac de Mauvoisin Dam was built. The dam along with increasing tourism in the mid-20th Century changed the character of the villages dramatically. The village economies changed from alpine farming to domination by the services sector.\n\nUntil 1957 Bagnes was a loose federation of villages, which was divided into districts or sections. The local councils continued to represent their sections until 1971.\n\nStarting in the 12th Century, Le Châble was the administrative center of the entire Val de Bagnes. Verbier castle (also called the \"abbaye\") is first mentioned in 1287. The castle came to be known as the \"abbaye\" since it was the seat of the abbey of Saint-Maurice's representative. In 1410 the castle was rebuilt into a residence of the abbots. In 1476 it was partially destroyed by the villagers. In 1745 it was besieged during the revolt against the abbot of Saint-Maurice. The castle was acquired in the 20th Century by the municipality.\n\nThe facade of the late gothic parish church of St. Mauritius was built in 1520 and the choir was finished in 1534. The ossuary dates back to 1560 and the parish house to the 16th century.\n\nIn 1953, the village was connected to the Martigny-Sembrancher-Le Châble rail line.\n\nBagnes has an area, , of .

The song \"Luckie\" was derived from an earlier composition Nyro had played at her audition for Verve Records in 1966. Before she signed to Columbia Records, Verve had already planned to release the album, under the title \"Soul Picnic\". \nThe album saw its actual release in 1968 on the Columbia label and became one of the year's underground successes. The album was written entirely by Nyro, arranged by Charlie Calello and produced by both. On Nyro's insistence, the album's lyric sheet (which itself was a rarity for records in 1968) was perfumed, and fans have reported that it still has a pleasant scent.\n\nThe album's themes are of passion, love, romance, death, and drugs, and the songs are delivered in Nyro's distinctive brash, belting vocals. Musically, it is a multi-layered and opulent work, including multi-tracked vocals and strings. The album's loose genre is pop, but it also incorporates elements of soul, gospel, jazz, and rock.\n\nIt is generally considered to be Nyro's most accessible and most famous work, although it is arguably not the most commercially successful or critically favored (both honors go to the follow-up, \"New York Tendaberry\"). The album was her first chart entry, reaching No. 181 on the \"Billboard\" 200, when it was known as \"Pop Albums.\" In the February 2016 issue of UNCUT magazine it was rated in the 100 Greatest Albums of All Time. Many musicians, including Elton John and Todd Rundgren were directly influenced by the album and bandleader Paul Shaffer told CBC Television's George Stroumboulopoulos that he considers this album to be his one \"desert island record\".\n\nThe album is second only to its predecessor, 1967's \"More Than a New Discovery\", in producing hit songs for other artists. Three Dog Night took \"Eli's Comin'\" to US No. 10, while The 5th Dimension went to US No. 3 with \"Stoned Soul Picnic\" and US No. 13 with \"Sweet Blindness\".\n\nThe legacy of the album is evident on the 1997 compilation \"\", which includes 6 songs from the 1968 album.\n\nSix songs from \"Eli and the Thirteenth Confession\" are included in the ballet \"Quintet\" performed by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.\n\n\"Eli and the Thirteenth Confession\" was reissued in expanded and remastered format during the summer of 2002. The reissue was produced by Al Quaglieri, with Laura Grover as project director. The reissue featured three previously unreleased demos recorded on November 29, 1967. The 20-year-old Nyro performed the spare, solo demos of \"Lu,\" \"Stoned Soul Picnic,\" and \"Emmie\" on piano and multi-tracked her own voice to add harmonies. The accompanying booklet includes photographs and recording details, as well as liner notes by Rick Petreycik and a back-cover recollection by Phoebe Snow. The remastered version was issued alongside remastered/expanded editions of \"New York Tendaberry\" and \"Gonna Take a Miracle\".\n\nIn August 2011, the album was re-released in audiophile vinyl by label \"Music on Vinyl\", using high-resolution digital audio at 96 kHz / 24 bit.\n\nIn June 2016, Audio Fidelity reissued the album on hybrid Super Audio CD. It contains the original stereo version in high-resolution digital audio as well as a previously unreleased 4-channel quadraphonic mix, which was created in 1971. Prior to this release only one track, Eli's Comin', had been released in quad on a rare Columbia Records sampler LP.\n\n\n\n"}

Each player is a fighter pilot of the British, French, American, or German air service. Each game is a single dogfight, in which players try to shoot down as many enemy planes as possible without being shot down themselves. There is no limit to the number of players in a single game.\nIt was first published by Game Designers Workshop (GDW), in 1983. The game is named after the prestigious German order Pour le Mérite, informally known as Blue Max.\n\n\"Blue Max\" was designed by Phil Hall and originally released in 1983. A reprint of the boxed version was released in 1992. An updated miniatures version was released in 1995 that included early war aircraft designed by Alan Wright. The miniatures version did not include the aircraft counters or map of the boxed versions. \"Blue Max\" was selected as one of the best one hundred games by Games Magazine in 1993 and won the GAMA award for graphics in the same year. \"Canvas Eagles\", an upgraded version of Blue Max, was designed by Eric Hotz and released free on the web.\n\nThe game is played on an hexagonal board, using a maneuver chart from which, every turn, you decide which move your plane will do. After every player has decided their move, all the planes are moved simultaneously on the map. You can fire at another plane only if it is directly in front of your plane and at a maximum distance of 3 hexes.\n\nThe rules are simple and most of them are contained in the components used during play; reference to the rule manual is rarely necessary. After playing some games, you can start to use the campaign rules which add another level of fun and challenge to the game. \n\nThe last edition of the game, the third one, has been published by Giochi Uniti and Stratelibri on February 2014.\n\nThe game was at least translated into French (\"Les Ailes de la gloire\", Oriflam, 1992) and into Spanish (\"Blue Max\", Diseños Orbitales, 1992).\n\nPaul Cockburn reviewed \"Blue Max\" for \"Imagine\" magazine, and stated that \"It's fun to play, although it does not have lasting appeal. Frankly, only a pretty dedicated WWI flying ace - beagles aside - will ever actually earn the 20 kills necessary to wear the Blue Max.\"\n\n"}

The temples are characterised by the Nirvana image, a statue of the reclining Buddha.\n\nCentral to Shinnyo-en is the belief, expressed in the \"Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\", that all beings possess Buddha-nature, a natural, unfettered purity that can respond creatively and compassionately to any situation in life.\n\nShinnyo-en was established in 1936 by Shinjō Itō and his wife Tomoji in the Tokyo suburb of Tachikawa. In December 1935, Shinjō Itō and Tomoji Itō had enshrined an image of Acala believed to have been sculpted by the renowned Buddhist sculptor Unkei and they began a 30-day period of winter austerities in early 1936. Tomoji cultivated her on February 4, inheriting it from her aunt.\n\nIn May 1936, Shinjō Itō was ordained by Daisōjō and Chief Abbot Egen Saeki at Sanbō-in, a temple of the Daigo school of Shingon Buddhism. The Chief Abbot conferred to him the monastic name of \"Shinjō\", meaning \"True Vehicle\", and the title of \"Kongō-in\", which means \"Vajra\", in December 1938. Accordingly, he changed his name from Fumiaki Itō to Shinjō Itō in April 1942.\n\nThe community was first named \"Risshō-kaku\", then the \"Tachikawa Fellowship of Achala\" (\"Tachikawa Fudoson Kyokai\", 1938-1948). Formally registered in 1948 under the Religious Corporations Ordinance (, enacted in 1945) the name changed to \"Sangha of Truth\" (\"Makoto-Kyodan\") with Shinchō-ji as its Head Temple.\n\nIn spring of 1949, a young man who worked in the temple office, filed formal charges against Shinjō in 1950. His primary claim was that he had been beaten during one of the \"sesshin\" trainings. Shuten Oishi, director of the Federation of New Religious Organisations of Japan, testified that \"sesshin\" training does not involve physical abuse. Shinjō was given a sentence of eight months in prison, suspended for three years.\n\nThe \"sangha\" was permitted to continue, but under a different name. It was reorganized and renamed \"Shinnyo-en\" on June 21, 1951 and Tomoji Itō became its administrative head. After the revision of the Japanese Religious Corporation Act in April 1951, Shinnyo-en filed an application in the following year and received approval from the Minister of Education on May 16, 1953.\n\nThe first image of the reclining Nirvana Buddha, sculpted by Shinjō Itō, was consecrated on November 3, 1957.\n\nWat Paknam Bhasicharoen, a Thai vihara, presented Shinnyo-en with śarīra (relics of Gautama Buddha) on July 30, 1966.\n\nThe first Shinnyo-en Sanctuary outside Japan was inaugurated on March 2, 1971 in Mililani, Hawaii, followed by the dedication of temples in Honolulu (1973), San Francisco (1982), Taiwan (1985), France (1985), Los Angeles (1990), Italy (1990), Belgium (1991), Hong Kong (1992), U.K. (1994), Germany (1994), Singapore (1994), and Australia (1999).\n\nThe principal sutras on which the Shinnyo teachings are based are the \"Prajñāpāramitā Sutra\", the \"Lotus Sutra\" and the \"Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\". According to Shinnyo-en, the \"Mahāparinirvāṇa Sutra\" teaches four key points:\n\nJunna Nakata, the 103rd Head Priest of Daigoji Monastery of the Shingon School, describes the teaching as follows:\nSchrimpf commented on the introduction of the Mahaparinirvana sutra to Shinnyo-en members in 1956,\nThe teachings also integrate elements of traditional Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, cultural influences characteristic to Japanese Buddhism, as well as practices and rituals initiated by Shinjo Ito, the founder of Shinnyo-en.\n\nAs all religious organizations founded since the middle of the 19th century Shinnyo-en is classified by Japanese scholars as a new religious movement.\n\nAccording to Schrimpf, \"the community is divided into various units that form a hierarchical pyramid.\"\nThe basic organizational unit of the Shinnyo-en sangha is said to be the “lineage” (), which consists of a group of members mentored by a “lineage parent” (). Practitioners usually gather at the temple and training centre for prayer, meditation and training, and, if they so wish, also at home meetings. The sangha as a whole encourages and participates in volunteer activities in the spirit of Buddhist practice.\n\nThe leadership in Shinnyo-en follows the Buddhist tradition of Dharma succession from master to disciple:\n\nIn 1982 Shinsō Itō (born 1942 as Masako Itō), the third daughter of Shinjō and Tomoji, completed her Buddhist training. Shinjō announced her to become his successor in 1983 and gave her the priestly name 'Shinsō'. After Shinjō's passing on July 19, 1989 Shinsō Itō becomes the head of Shinnyo-en. In 1992, Shinsō Itō was conferred Daisōjo, the highest priestly rank in traditional Shingon Buddhism, by the Daigo-ji Shingon Buddhist monastery. She also received an honorary doctorate from Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University in Thailand in 2002 for her long-standing efforts to foster relations with Theravada Buddhism.\n\nIn Shinnyo-en's Dharma School () members study buddhist doctrine and learn ritualistic aspects. After graduating as a Dharma Teacher they can further qualify for undergoing Buddhist ordination () and receiving traditional monastic ranks.\n\nShinnyo-en believes an individual's action can contribute to creating a harmonious society. Working towards this goal, the organization engages in interfaith dialogue, environmental activities, and disaster relief. Shinnyo-en also supports organizations such as Médecins sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), the Red Cross Society, and the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nIn an interview conducted by the Tricycle magazine, Shinso Ito stated: \n\nShinnyo-en practitioners are encouraged to practice \"sesshin\" training and undertake the , which are a distillation of the Pāramitā taught by Shakyamuni Buddha.\n\n are:\nConcretely, this means abiding by the principles of the Teachings, participating in volunteer activities, and donating small sums of money.\n\n\"Sesshin\" (the word is composed of the two Chinese characters, “touch” and “heart”) is the central element of spiritual practice for Shinnyo practitioners. This is not to be confused with the \"sesshin\" in Zen Buddhism. Whereas in Zen Buddhism, \"sesshin\" refers to a period of intensive meditation, with many hours of meditation each day, \"sesshin\" in Shinnyo-en has an entirely different meaning.\n\nA \"sesshin\" involves receiving guidance from a , a person who has been specially trained and whose is recognized by the Shinnyo-en organization. This kind of guidance lasts for about three minutes per person, and is, in most cases, given only at a Shinnyo-en temple, aimed to help members to understand themselves in light of Buddhist concepts.\n\nShinnyo-en refers to the spiritual world from which the guiding messages emanate as the \"shinnyo reikai\" (). This is not merely the dwelling place of the spirits of the dead, it also encompasses and is equated with the . The spiritual guides' contact with this world is not direct, but aided by the intercession of two and various dharma protectors, who are viewed as being one with forces of the heavens and earth. The Two Dōjis are none other than the first and second sons of Ito Shinjo, posthumously named, respectively, Kyodoin (, died aged one year old) and Shindoin (, died aged fifteen). Guidance from the \"Buddha realm\" is passed to the spiritual guides and subsequently to the practitioners.\n\nSchrimpf describes the practice of \"sesshin\" as follows:\nPractitioners have the opportunity to further their practice by studying at Shinnyo-en's dharma school. After three years of classes and fulfilling various requirements, including passing a written test and assessment of everyday practice, they are granted priestly ranks (僧階 sokai) and become dharma teachers.\n\nAccording to the Shinnyo-en website they practice water and fire ceremonies. \"While most traditional Buddhist fire rituals focus on personal purification and awakening, the Shinnyo-en ceremony is dedicated to awakening people to their innate compassionate and altruistic nature, transcending all boundaries of age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, and religious tradition, and directing the positive energy of the ceremony outward with the hope that all people can live in a world of hope and harmony.\"\n\nThrough mindfulness and seated meditation, practitioners reflect on themselves and resolve to practice harmony, gratitude, kindness, and acceptance. The school teaches that one realizes his or her true potential by acting with compassion and concern for others. Therefore, practitioners are encouraged to cultivate mindfulness and self-reflection, and to apply in daily life the insights gained in seated meditation.\n\nShinnyo-en practitioners in pursuing the Path to Nirvana vow to abide by the Five Precepts (Pali: pañca-sīlāni) and follow the Eightfold Path, although no reference can be found of Shinnyo-en teaching Right Mindfulness, nor Right Concentration, these being the last two steps on the Eightfold Path and those which contain traditional Buddhist meditation practice.\n\nBy learning to identify with others (or \"place oneself in the shoes of another\"), practitioners aim to cultivate the virtues of a bodhisattva.\n\nIn Shinnyo-en a school for the training of missionaries has been developed, and lectures are given on the Shinnyo-en doctrine, history, and missionary methods. Students take three years to complete the prescribed course of study. The system of missionary ranks is called sokai or “stages in Buddhist discipleship.”\n\nTraditional ceremonies, derived from Shingon Buddhism — many of which can be traced back to ancient Vedic and Hindu ceremonies — are an important aspect of Shinnyo Buddhist practice. Rituals are used as means to purify the mind, awaken compassion, or to express gratitude for the chance to develop oneself and practice the Buddhist teachings.\n\nPrayers for ancestors and departed souls, such as the Lantern Floating ceremony, and O-bon (Sanskrit: Ullambana), are believed to also help cultivate kindness and compassion within practitioners.\n\nWith the wish of creating cultural harmony and understanding, Her Holiness Shinso Ito, Head Priest of Shinnyo-en, officiated the inaugural Lantern Floating Hawaii ceremony on Memorial Day, 1999.\n\nTraditional fire ceremonies such as \"homa\" are performed to help practitioners overcome obstacles that hinder their spiritual progress and liberation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2246914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246914", "title": "Ray of Light (song)", "text": "Ray of Light (song)\n\n\"Ray of Light\" is a song by American singer Madonna. It is the title track from her seventh studio album \"Ray of Light\" (1998), and was released as the album's second single on May 6, 1998, by Maverick Records. The song was also included on the compilation albums \"GHV2\" (2001) and \"Celebration\" (2009). Written by Madonna, William Orbit, Clive Maldoon, Dave Curtiss, Christine Leach, and produced by Madonna and Orbit, \"Ray of Light\" is based on Curtiss Maldoon's \"Sepheryn\" and is an electronic dance song with techno, trance, Eurodance, and disco influences. \"Ray of Light\" consists of a main synth sound oscillating on the primary musical note, and an electric guitar riff. Lyrically, the song has a theme of freedom.\n\nThe song has received critical acclaim by music critics, for its club-friendly, electronic sound, lyrics, and \"emotional warmth\". The song was also nominated for three Grammy Awards; for Record of the Year, Best Dance Recording, and Best Short Form Music Video, winning the last two. \"Ray of Light\" debuted and peaked at number five on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming Madonna's highest debut on the chart to date. It also reached number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Internationally, the song reached the top five in Canada, Finland and the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Greece, Scotland, and Spain.\n\nAn accompanying music video for \"Ray of Light\" was directed by Jonas Åkerlund and shows scenes from different cities around the world, with Madonna singing the song in front of them. The video was critically acclaimed, receiving the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, as well as winning five awards at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. Later, Stefano Salvati accused her of plagiarizing the concept of a music video he directed for Biagio Antonacci in 1994. The song has been performed in three of Madonna's concert tours, the last being the Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008–09). It has been covered by a number of artists, and has been featured in several elements of popular culture, such as on the FOX show \"Glee\", as well as different advertising campaigns.\n\nSince 1996, Madonna went through a number of \"life-changing experiences\" which included giving birth to her daughter Lourdes, gaining interest in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah, as well as earning the title role on the film adaptation of the musical \"Evita\" (1996). A year later she started working on \"Ray of Light\", her seventh studio album. Madonna wrote songs with William Orbit, Patrick Leonard, Rick Nowels and Babyface. The album would reflect the singer's changed perspectives about life. Author Carol Benson noted that it was a \"deeply spiritual dance record\", with the crux of it based on Madonna's career, her journey and the many identities she had assumed over the years. Motherhood had softened the singer emotionally, which was reflected in the songs. She started talking about ideas and used words which implied deep and personal thoughts, rather than the regular dance-floor anthemic tunes she had composed.\n\nMadonna worked primarily with Orbit after Guy Oseary, Maverick Records's partner, phoned Orbit and suggested that he send some songs to the singer. He sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, and \"Ray of Light\" was among these tracks. It is based on the track \"Sepheryn\" (1971), by English folk music duo Curtiss Maldoon (consisting of Dave Curtiss and Clive Maldoon). In 1996, English singer and songwriter Christine Leach, Maldoon's niece, had recorded her version of the track. Leach said she had always loved the duo's work and \"Sepheryn\" was her favorite. She worked for a time with Orbit and recorded a demo of \"Sepheryn\" over a melody on which he was working. Leach rewrote the chorus and also removed a few bits from the original composition. Orbit included it in the DAT thinking that Leach had written the song. After Madonna heard the demo she liked it, and reworked the lyrics to create \"Ray of Light\".\n\nThe track was released as the second single from the parent album on May 6, 1998 in the United States. Curtiss was not aware of the fact that Madonna had recorded \"Sepheryn\" as \"Ray of Light\" and heard it for the first time being played on the radio. He \"couldn't believe it\" and was initially a bit annoyed, but became pleased with what Madonna had done with his original composition. He was also satisfied with the 15% royalties he received as songwriter credit. Madonna took 30% royalties, another 15% were given to Maldoon's estate and the rest were earned by Madonna's record company. The singer said about the song: \"It's totally out of control. The original version is well over 10 minutes long. It was completely indulgent, but I loved it. It was heartbreaking to cut it down to a manageable length.\" The original version was to be included on a compilation album titled \"Veronica Electronica\", but it was not released. Curtiss confirmed in an interview with \"The Australian\" in January 2017, that he recorded a contemporary jazz version of \"Sepheryn\".\n\n\"Ray of Light\" was recorded along with the rest of the album at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood, California during summer 1997. It was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Studios in New York. The DAT contained the main portion of the song recordings, as well as preliminary demo sessions in Madonna's house in New York, as well as Hit Factory Studios where Madonna first sang the song. Like most of the album, the synth sounds recorded for \"Ray of Light\" were played on a Roland Juno-106. Madonna and Orbit had conducted a drummer session in Los Angeles, but it did not work out. So he contacted Fergus Gerrand who played drum samples for him in London. Orbit fed them in his workstation and cut them manually, instead of using auto-editing software like ReCycle.\nAn electronic dance music song, \"Ray of Light\" has stylistic influences from acid electronica. According to biographer Lucy O'Brien who wrote in \"\", Orbit created a sensurround like atmosphere in the track, which sees Madonna deepen her dance roots and go for a more electronic sound. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, the song is set in common time, with a moderately fast-groove tempo of 126 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major, with Madonna's vocals on the song spanning 2 octaves and 1 semitone from B to B, the high note being belted on the word 'feel' near the end of the song. \"Ray of Light\" has a basic sequence of B–E–B–E–B as its chord progression.\n\nThe song starts with an electric guitar riff comparable to the music of English alternative rock band Oasis. The chords harmonize with each other, continuing for 22 seconds. The techno melody then begins, consisting of a main synth sound oscillating on the primary musical note, with the EQ moving between the bass and the treble. The \"restless\" beat is accompanied by a rock-inspired chord riff, with Madonna's pitch being higher than the other tracks from the album. While recording, Orbit kept \"Ray of Light\" a semitone higher than the singer's limit, resulting in a strain added to the vocals. \"She got frustrated when we were recording but you want that bit of edge with singers, that thing of reaching. You can't fake it, and you can hear it when she cracks it on the record,\" he recalled. Before the final chorus there is a synth solo again, reminiscent of a 1970s pro-rock record. According to Rikky Rooksby, author of \"The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna\", this was a link to the origin of the song from \"Sepheryn\".\n\nLyrically, the track is upbeat, keeping in theme with the music. According to Madonna the verses are a mystical look at the universe and how small we are compared to it. She wanted to capture a feeling of \"wonderment\" with the lyrics, as if some one has just opened their eyes and looked at the world for the first time. With \"NME\", Madonna further clarified that the lyrics convey the feeling of being small in comparison to the vast universe. It also talks about how regular life goes on faster \"than the speeding light\", but one can get out of that journey and look at themselves from an outsider's perspective.\n\n\"Ray of Light\" received acclaim from music critics. In a review of the album as a whole, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described it as \"swirling\". In a review of the maxi CD single, Liana Jonas of the same website called the track a \"wickedly good club song\" and \"sonically progressive yet listener-friendly\". She also praised Madonna's vocals, comparing them to those of a \"club diva to celestial goddess\". \"The title track builds from another incongruously pretty guitar arpeggio into thumping rave anthem mode,\" Stuart Maconie wrote in a \"Q\" review of \"Ray of Light\", \"but always underscored with keen musical intelligence. It could be a lighter, less one-dimensional Chemical Brothers.\"\n\nLarry Flick of \"Billboard\" described it as Madonna at her best, calling it a \"spiritually charged, often poetic song\". He especially mentioned the flexible vocals and Madonna's progression as a recording artist. Rob Sheffield from \"Rolling Stone\" in his review for the album as a whole, wrote that, alongside other tracks such as \"Swim\" and \"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\", Madonna is \"positively ferocious\" sounding on \"Ray of Light\". Sal Cinquemani of \"Slant Magazine\" wrote that the song was a \"celebratory tech-frenzy\", and noted Madonna's elated singing, giving it an \"A\" rating. In a review of Madonna's second hits compilation, \"GHV2\" (2001), Cinequemani wrote:\n\nLike no other Madonna hit in recent memory, the frenetic “Ray of Light” found the singer in a celebratory tech-frenzy. Whether it was an epiphany of the spiritual or sonic kind, her elation was unmistakable. Orbit’s cycles of analog synths and electric guitar licks perfectly supplemented the elasticity of Madonna’s newly-trained vocal chords. Not since “Deeper and Deeper” had she reached such dizzying heights.\n\nA reviewer from Sputnikmusic listed the track as a recommended listen from \"Ray of Light\". O'Brien found the track to be an \"ecstatic hymn to the skies\". \"The A.V. Club\"s Stephen Thompson commented that the \"pumped-up title track is bound to be a deserving smash\". J.D. Considine of \"The Baltimore Sun\" noted that Madonna's \"newfound strength is particularly apparent in pulsing, rhythm driven tracks like ['Ray of Light'], which finds her soaring confidently at the top of her register on the busily percolating chorus, then whispering breathily on the brief, dream-like bridge\". David Browne, while reviewing \"Ray of Light\" for \"Entertainment Weekly\", deemed the song a \"sirenlike techno-glitter-ball\". Idolator's Stephen Sears explained that Madonna's vocals throughout the album were a \"game-changer\", including on the song, as she strengthened her voice while working on her film \"Evita\". He ends his review by stating \"Indeed, no choir is needed to lift 'Ray Of Light' into disco heaven. Madonna supplies the highs herself in some perfect moments: the extended, spiraling way she wails 'yea-ea-ears' at 3:27 or how her vocal spins out of control at 4:14, matched by Orbit's frenzied guitar work\". Ranking Madonna's singles in honour of her 60th birthday, \"The Guardian\"s Jude Rogers called it one of her \"most joyous electronic pop singles\".\n\nIn the United States, \"Ray of Light\" was Madonna's highest debuting single at number five on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, for the issue dated July 11, 1998. It was her highest-debuting single, surpassing previous best debuts with \"You'll See\" (1995) and \"Frozen\" (1998), both of which opened at number eight. The track became the singer's then 37th top-40 hit, moving her past Connie Francis on the list of women with most top-40 chartings on Hot 100. \"Ray of Light\" was present for a total of 20 weeks on the Hot 100, and placed at number 75 on the year-end chart. The song also reached the top of the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart of \"Billboard\", remaining at the top position for a total of four weeks. \"Ray of Light\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in September 1998, for shipment of 500,000 copies of the single across United States. In Canada, it debuted at number 85 on the \"RPM\" Singles Chart and reached number three in its eighth week. It was present on the chart for a total of 30 weeks.\n\nIn Australia, \"Ray of Light\" debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at its peak of number six on May 24, 1998, staying there for one week. It was present for a total of 17 weeks on the chart, and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 35,000 copies of the single. At the year-end charts of ARIA, \"Ray of Light\" was the 57th best-selling Australian single of 1998. In New Zealand, \"Ray of Light\" also debuted at its peak position of number nine on the RIANZ Singles Chart. It was present for a total of 14 weeks on the chart and fell out on September 13, 1998, at number 31.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Ray of Light\" debuted and peaked at number two on May 9, 1998, being held off from the number one spot by All Saints's \"Under the Bridge / Lady Marmalade\", which also debuted the same week. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it silver, for shipment of 200,000 copies of the song. According to the Official Charts Company, \"Ray of Light\" has sold 275,000 copies in the region as of August 2008. The track debuted at its peak of number nine on the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles chart, for the issue dated May 16, 1998. In Belgium, \"Ray of Light\" was moderately successful in both territories, peaking at number 25 in Flanders and 33 in Wallonia. In the Netherlands, the song debuted at number 45 on the Dutch Top 40, and reached a peak of 22 on May 16, 1998, remaining there for three weeks. The song reached a peak of number two in Finland, where it remained for two weeks, before spending a total of five weeks on the chart. In Sweden, it reached number 14 and spent 10 weeks on the chart. On the Swiss Singles Chart, \"Ray of Light\" debuted at its peak of number 32 on the issue dated May 24, 1998. The song also reached number one in Spain on its debuting week. It stayed on the top spot for three weeks before descending the chart.\n\nThe music video for \"Ray of Light\" was directed by Jonas Åkerlund, who had previously shot the controversial clip for the song \"Smack My Bitch Up\" (1997) by The Prodigy. Madonna had been planning the video from the time she was filming the clip for previous single \"Frozen\" in the Mojave Desert. \"Smack My Bitch Up\" was her current favorite and she enlisted Åkerlund. Madonna stated that when she makes an album, she \"puts [her] soul on it\", but a music video is a lot more working with a director. With the \"Ray of Light\" album, she wanted to have videos with fresh expression, and hence wanted to collaborate with new directors. She liked Åkerlund's \"special way of working\" and spoke with him over the telephone. Their conversations continued for over six months, and most of the time was spent coming with a final concept for the clip. Åkerlund said in an interview with Swedish newspaper \"Aftonbladet\":\n\nI had two ideas that did not fit the song. She said no even though I had a very clear idea of how she would look in the video. I worked up on another idea and brought together a featured band for her to see. I did it all in front of me. [...] In retrospect, it feels good, the video we have done much better suited to the track than the first ideas. [Madonna] has an incredible track on everything she is doing. Style, music, business — she has a mental track of every single thing and won't give up until she is completely satisfied. And on music videos there is nothing she does with one hand on her back — she's engaged to one hundred percent.\nAccording to the singer, the clip portrays \"a day in the life of the earth to show that we are rushing forward to the end of the 1900s century at full speed. I think Jonas made an excellent interpretation of the song, although he forced me to dance like crazy for two days. He's a tough director\". Reviewers compared it to the 1982 American experimental film \"Koyaanisqatsi\", which showed time-lapse footage of cities. Madonna's scenes were shot in early April 1998 at MTV's Times Square studios in New York and Los Angeles. Background scenes were shot in various cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London, Las Vegas, and Stockholm. Test shots taken in Stockholm were presented to Madonna, for conveying the idea behind the clip, but they were deemed good to be used in the final product.\n\nDuring filming Åkerlund was accompanied by three of his Swedish employees, photographer Henrik Halvarsson, production designer Mattias Lindgren, and editor Max Vitali. Madonna's daughter Lourdes was also present on set. Åkerlund remembered that one day after the filming he got a call from Mick Jagger for directing the new music video for The Rolling Stones, however he had to decline since \"Ray of Light\" consumed all his time. They filmed for over 14 days, during which he fit the crew in one car, found an angle for the 35 mm camera and just waited as the shots were taken one by one. He had to carry a diagram in his pocket for the whole time, which had all the plans for every frame they shot. Every ten seconds they captured one frame and continued for half-an-hour to get around five seconds of footage, resulting in \"Ray of Light\" being the longest shoot ever for a music video for Åkerlund. They also mounted the camera on a bus and rode around New York capturing the scenes.\n\nMadonna insisted that the video should be edited in Los Angeles, since during the \"Frozen\" video she had a number of back and forth with director Chris Cunningham (who was in London editing), a process she did not want to repeat. This meant that Åkerlund and his team had to live in the United States for the whole duration. They lived in a hotel, ate take-away Chinese food and finished the clip. All the footage ended up in the actual video, since every scene was sped up and the song was long.\n\nThe music video premiered on MTV Live on May 12, 1998. The clip starts with the rising of the sun and a man opening the curtains in his house, until it progresses into the \"Koyaanisqatsi\" inspired section, featuring time-lapse images of daily life, from people riding a subway, ordering food, bowling, and children in a classroom to sped-up city-scapes and freeways at night. Interspersed in the scenes is Madonna dancing and singing the track, her image partially merged with the backdrop of the fast-sped cityscape. During the intermediate verse the high-speed motion stops with the camera focusing on Madonna only against a sunset backdrop but quickly speeds up again. As the clip continues into nightfall, high-speed images of Madonna dancing in a discothèque is shown, with the camera focusing on the revelers. She suddenly starts screaming. After that she is seen falling asleep on the dance floor, and a revolving shot of planet Earth.\n\nOn June 23, 1998, the clip was released on VHS as a limited edition of 40,000 copies by Warner Music Vision. It had sold 7,281 copies of the following month after its release, becoming the best-selling video singles of the Nielsen SoundScan era. The video charted on \"Billboard\"s Music Video Sales chart for a total of 13 weeks. A few days after its release, Italian director Stefano Salvati accused Madonna's Warner Bros. Records imprint Maverick Records for plagiarizing the concept of a music video he directed for Biagio Antonacci's 1994 single \"Non è Mai Stato Subito\". According to Salvati, copies of his videos were submitted to Maverick before the \"Ray of Light\" video was shot and requested it to be pulled from distribution. Both clips featured the respective singers performing at regular speed against a backdrop of high-speed images. However, he did not sue the singer or her companies.\n\nWith \"Ray of Light\", Madonna debuted her \"Earth Mother\" look, complete with long strawberry blond hair and bronzed body. Author Georges Claude Guilbert wrote in his book, \"Madonna as Postmodern Myth\", that her \"straggly, expensively unwashed look\" was comparable to that of singer Alanis Morissette and to Venetian paintings. According to Madonna, she went for an Italian Renaissance look, invoking work of painter Raphael and Botticelli. Guilbert found the singer's description as catering to postmodernism, in tune with the zeitgeist, and noted that it was just one of her \"many reinventions\". The book recalled how Madonna \"quickly grew tired of the Botticelli-Earth Mother phase\" with subsequent singles being promoted with a new Asian inspired look. In the book \"Ex-foliations: Reading Machines and the Upgrade Path\", author Terry Harpold commented about the time-lapse sequences, especially the image of a clock and its hands rotating past the hours. He felt that the clip portrays the daily life as a futile attempt for survival, enhanced by another shot showing the sonogram of a fetus \"in utero\", and a hamster running on a wheel. Santiago Fouz-Hernández, one of the authors of \"Madonna's Drowned Worlds\", described Madonna as esoteric in the clip, as well as \"skin-deep Beverly Hills spiritualism\". The video can be found on the Madonna compilations, \"\" (1999) and \"\" (2009).\n\nIn 1999, \"Ray of Light\" won two Grammy Awards for Best Dance Recording and Best Short Form Music Video. It was nominated for Record of the Year, but lost to Celine Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\". Furthermore, \"The Village Voice\" ranked it as the fourth best in 1998 in its Pazz & Jop critics' poll. At the 1999 ASCAP Rhythm and Soul Awards, the track was the Top Dance Song winner. It also won the category of Most Performed Song at the ASCAP Pop Awards the same year. The 1999 Ivor Novello Awards nominated the record in the category of International Hit of the Year\n\n\"Ray of Light\" is also often ranked as being one of the best songs of the 1990s. In 2003, \"Q Magazine\" ranked it at number 609 in its list of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\". In 2005, the song was placed at number 401 on \"Blender\"'s \"The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\". On \"Slant Magazine\"s list of the best singles of the 1990s, in which \"Ray of Light\" was placed 16th, a reviewer wrote that the song's \"beat is restless\", and that \"Ray of Light\" is \"a standout single\" due to its \"emotional warmth\". \"Billboard\" placed it at number five on their ranking of Madonna's best songs, saying that it \"marked a new chapter in her illustrious career\". In another ranking for the singer's 50 Greatest Songs by \"Rolling Stone\", \"Ray of Light\" attained a rank of number eight, with a writer from the magazine noting Madonna's \"most powerfully sung vocals to date\". In May 2018, \"Billboard\" ranked the top songs of 1998, ranking \"Ray of Light\" at number nine. Joe Lynch from the publication asserted that the composition \"gave radio its most joyous, ebullient and life-affirming dance banger... Yeah, the cool kids had been raving for years, but it took a trendsetting 39-year-old mom to crack open the top 40 for what was then called electronica's eventual pop takeover.\" One month later, \"The Guardian\" listed it as Madonna's fourth best single. Similarly, \"Entertainment Weekly\" listed it as her fifth greatest single.\n\nThe music video received a total of eight MTV Video Music Awards nominations in 1998, eventually winning five; for Video of the Year, Best Female Video, Best Direction, Best Editing and Best Choreography, becoming her most-winning song at the show. It was the first time that the singer won the Video of the Year award; Madonna said she was grateful for MTV's recognition of the clip. At the International Dance Music Awards, it won the trophy for Best Dance Video, and at the Much Music Video Awards, the clip won the Best International Video trophy. Other awards was won at the 1998 Music Video Production Association ceremony, winning the category of Best Pop Video of the Year. The video came atop a ranking of \"The Top 10 Videos That Broke The Rules\", issued by MTV on the channel's 25th anniversary in August 2006. In 2016, \"Rolling Stone\" listed it at position two on their ranking of \"Madonna's 20 Greatest Videos\" with Bilge Ebiri from the publication calling it a \"bold embrace of electronica that got Madonna her due at the VMAs\".\n\nIn February 1998, Madonna premiered \"Ray of Light\" during a surprise concert at the Roxy NYC nightclub for promoting the parent album. Three months later she appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and performed it along with album track \"Little Star\". During the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards Madonna started performing \"Shanti/Ashtangi\", sporting black hair and wearing an Indian sari. Lenny Kravitz then appeared playing the guitar, which paved way to \"Ray of Light\". A religious group called the World Vaishnava Association (WVA) claimed that Madonna offended Hindus with the performance by wearing Hinduism symbols on her head. A spokesperson for the association stated that the mark (called an Om) is a symbol of chastity, harmony and purity, and is designed to show \"dedication to God\". The representative also said that because Madonna simulated a sexual act and wore a see-through tank top onstage while wearing the mark, she offended both Hindus and Yogis. A spokesperson for Madonna stated that the singer did not understand why WVA was upset as she had not done anything insulting, and did not wish to insult anyone. However, the vice president of WVA claimed that \"the Hindu community and Eastern spiritual seekers the world over should be happy for Madonna personally in terms of her genuine interest in enlightened life, and grateful to her for her sincere efforts to attract others to the same\".\n\n\"Ray of Light\" has also been featured in the set lists of three Madonna tours – 2001's Drowned World Tour, 2006's Confessions Tour and 2008–2009's Sticky & Sweet Tour. On the Drowned World Tour, it was included as the fifth song on the \"Neo-Punk\" segment, where the singer performed it wearing punk inspired clothing, and the backdrop screens showed an extended version of the song's music video. This time, the electric guitar was played by Monte Pittman. Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH noted that \"things quickly hotted up with [...] 'Ray Of Light', a track that was quite simply as sublime as it was infectious\". In 2005, Madonna performed \"Ray of Light\" during the Live 8 benefit concert, and a year later at the 2006 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California. During her 2006 Confessions Tour, Madonna included a rock version of \"Ray of Light\" as the second song of the show's third act, the \"Glam-Punk\" segment. For this performance the singer played the electric guitar and urged the audience to jump-along. She was accompanied by six male backup dancers, dressed in black outfits and white ties doing a synchronized choreography. \"Rolling Stone\" called the performance \"hard-rocking\".\n\n\"Ray of Light\" was next performed by Madonna during the 2007 Live Earth concert in London's Wembley Stadium again accompanied by a guitarist. Madonna's performance at the event was watched by 4.5 million people. For the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour, \"Ray of Light\" was included as the third song of the show's final segment. This time, Madonna played the electric guitar again and wore a futuristic outfit with a breastplate and a short wig. She was accompanied by her dancers who were dressed in futuristic outfits and performed a robotic choreography. While reviewing the tour in 2008, Jim Farber from \"New York Daily News\" called the performance of the song one of the \"highest-energy\" dance numbers of the show. On December 6, 2016, Madonna performed the song during the Carpool Karaoke segment of \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\". Finally, the singer performed \"Ray of Light\" at Leonardo DiCaprio's annual fundraising gala in Saint-Tropez, France on July 27, 2017.\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's medley \"Polka Power!\" from the 1999 album \"Running with Scissors\" includes a polka version of the chorus of \"Ray of Light\". On the 2004 compilation \"Platinum Blonde NRG, Vol. 2: Nrgised Madonna Classics\", a Hi-NRG cover is performed by Future Force. English singer Natasha Bedingfield recorded a cover version of \"Ray of Light\" for BBC Radio 1's 40th anniversary. Played during \"The Chris Moyles Show\" on September 19, 2007, the track was included on the \"Radio 1. Established 1967\" compilation album. Bedingfield commented: \"I have so much respect for Madonna after learning how hard it is to sing that song. She has an amazing voice—the range you need to sing the song is incredible\". In 2008, Iggy Pop and The Stooges performed \"Ray of Light\" (along with \"Burning Up\") during Madonna's induction in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2010, the song was included in the film \"Burlesque\", during the sequence showing the character Ali (played by Christina Aguilera) rehearsing for her new position as a dancer in a Burlesque Lounge. In late 2012, American singer Adam Lambert performed a cover version on VH1 Divas, dancing through laser lights while donning a priestly black and white tunic.\n\nThe song was famously used by Microsoft in its 2001 advertising campaign for Windows XP. It begins with a man leaping through a green field and then lifting off into a sunny sky—a landscape lifted from Windows XP's default \"bliss screen\". There is also a series of images of people using Windows XP for real-time communications, to collaborate in an airy restaurant, to relay digital images of flying people, watch videos and listen to music. Then, a snippet from the song follows the phrase: \"Faster than the speeding light she's flying... You soar. Yes you can\". The campaign was reworked after the September 11 attacks; the tag line \"Prepare to fly\" was changed to \"Yes you can\", to sidestep new concerns about air travel, said Stephanie Ferguson, director of the company's PC Experience Solutions Marketing Group. In 2008, a Sunsilk shampoo commercial included shots of Marilyn Monroe and Shakira with songs well known by them, and ends with several video shots of Madonna to the sounds of \"Ray of Light\". Madonna reportedly received US$10 million for the song's usage. The commercial premiered on Super Bowl XLII. In 2010, \"Glee\" tribute episode \"The Power of Madonna\" featured \"Ray of Light\" playing in the background as the school's cheerleading team performed a complicated stilts routine. In the 2011 \"Family Guy\" episode \"New Kidney in Town\", main character Peter Griffin is seen in the \"Ray of Light\" video after drinking Red Bull.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits and personnel adapted from \"Ray of Light\" album liner notes.\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Physical\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Digital\n\n\n\n"}

The whisky was named after a character in Sir Walter Scott's renowned novel \"Rob Roy\" – a bailie (magistrate) who tackled a sword-wielding Highland clansman in an inn at Clachan of Aberfoyle, setting fire to his kilt with a red-hot poker. The blend was particularly popular in the early 20th century. \n\nThe brand was relaunched in 1994 by Glenmorangie plc (as Macdonald & Muir had been renamed). The composition of the blend was changed from the original recipe due to market forces. Single malts from the Highlands, Islay and Speyside are blended together with a grain whisky from Ayrshire. In comparison, many blended whiskies contain between 20-40 single malts. The minimum maturation time in a cask is eight years and the final BNJ whisky contains 60% single malt and 40% grain whisky. In 2014 Glenmorangie announced it would discontinue BNJ, citing high demand for their malt, all of which is now used for their single malt whiskies. The BNJ has since made a quiet exit from the market and bottles are becoming extremely difficult to find.\n\nThe English newspaper \"The Independent\" ranked it as one of the \"Top 10 Best Scotch Whiskies\".\n"}

By contrast, the Barnard family in Holland (the western provinces of the Netherlands) can be definitively traced back to \"circa\" 1751 (Izaak Barnard) of Scheveningen. The countries from which they entered Holland prior to that date are uncertain. The Jewish branch of the Barnard family in England is well documented, and is thought to have arrived in England and Ireland, after the time of the readmission of Jews by Oliver Cromwell (1656); some of whom can be traced back to Rabbi Daniel Barnard of Canterbury, with notable descendants around London, Chatham, Dartford, Kingston upon Hull, Stockton-on-Tees, Bournemouth, Ipswich, Norwich and in Australia.\n\nThe surname is most commonly found in Greater London and the South Eastern counties of England, and in California, Texas, Florida and New York in the United States of America.

Ajitha was subsequently arrested, tried and sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nAfter her jail sentence, Ajitha parted ways with the armed struggle movement and is currently a human rights activist and social reformer with an active presence in Kerala's social milieu. Anweshi, the non-governmental organisation she founded in 1993 which now is a constituent of Kerala Sthree Vedhi (Kerala Women's Forum), works for the cause of women's rights in co-ordination with the National Mission for Empowerment of Women.\n\nAjitha is married to Yakoob, a former colleague and the couple has a son named Clint and a daughter named Gargi. She is a hard core atheist.\n\nK. Ajitha was born in April 1950 in Kozhikode, Kerala, India to Kunnikkal Narayanan and Mandakini, both active supporters of naxalite movement. She had her early education in Kozhikode. By the time Ajitha reached college, she became disillusioned with the society and started associating with the naxal movement. She dropped out of college while doing Pre-degree course and became an active naxalite.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Ajitha got associated with Arikkad Varghese, a militant activist working against the atrocities meted out by the feudal lords and police to the tribal and villagers of Wyanad. They formed a group in 1968 and decided to take up arms. Ajitha was the only female member of the group.\n\nOn 22 November 1968, a group of about 300 armed guerrillas, under Ajitha's father Kunnikkal Narayanan, made an unsuccessful attempt to attack the Thalassery police station with the aim to steal arms.\n\n48 hours later, on 24 November 1968, the group, under the leadership of Varghese and consisting of Thettamala Krishnankutty, Kurichiyan Kunjiraman, Kisan Thomman, Philip M. Prasad and Ajitha, targeted the Madras Special Police camp in Pulpally set up to deal with the 7000 farmers who were agitating against the eviction by Pulpally Dewaswom authorities. The armed attack left 2 policemen, a wireless operator and a sub inspector dead. Later, the group attacked the farms of two local landlords and distributed the food grains stocked there to the tribals.\n\nAfter the raids, the militants entered the dense forests of Wyanad and went into hiding. But, they were captured by the police after a few days of intensive search. Varghese was shot dead in an encounter. One of the leaders of the group, Kisan Thomman, was also killed in a bomb blast.\n\nAfter her capture, Ajitha was reported to have endured torture at the police station; she was paraded before the public and was reportedly submitted to the Third degree treatment. After the trial that ensued, Ajitha was sentenced to 9 years of solitary confinement in prison.\n\nShe spent the first half of the term at the Central Jail at Trivandrum and the latter half at the Cannanore jail where her parents were also imprisoned. Ajitha used the time in prison to learn about the problems faced by women of Kerala, especially sex workers.\n\nShe was released in 1977 after 8 years at the age of 27.\n\nAfter her release from prison, Ajitha attempted to start a normal life, married Yakoob and gave birth to a baby girl. However, it was a short-lived attempt when, in 1988, a conference of women's organisations in Mumbai influenced her to return to social activism and she founded an organisation called 'Bodhana' (Awareness), based in Kozhikode (Calicut).\n\nThe organisation could not carry on for long but Ajitha set up another organisation called Anweshi (the Searcher) in 1993. She was an active participant in many sensational human rights cases in Kerala.\n\nIce cream parlour case (1997) involved the sexual exploitation of minor girls at a local ice cream parlour in Kozhikode which offered ice cream laced with sedatives to sexually exploit them later. The scandal surfaced when five minor girls approached Ajitha who, under the aegis of Anweshi, conducted a private investigation and reported the matter to the police. They alleged that the dead bodies of two teenage girls found on the railway tracks in the city had strong connection with the case. Many known names such as that of P. K. Kunhalikutty, Kerala's Industries Minister at that time and leader of Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), CPM leader T.P Dasan and some custom officials featured on the list of accused.\n\nDuring the trial, two of the five victims retracted their statements. Kerala High Court, in 2005, dismissed the petition and the Supreme Court dismissed the case citing lack of evidence in 2006.\n\nIn 2016, she supported Amnesty international in the controversy against ABVP.\n\nAnweshi, the NGO founded by Ajitha, has received many awards for its contribution to the social cause.\n\n"}

Written by Edmund Beloin and Jack Rose, the film is about a baby photographer on death row in San Quentin State Prison who tells reporters his history. While taking care of his private-eye neighbor's office, he is asked by an irresistible baroness to find a missing baron, which initiates a series of confusing but sinister events in a gloomy mansion and a private sanatorium. Spoofing movie detectives and the film noir style, the film features Lon Chaney, Jr. playing Willie, a character based on his \"Of Mice and Men\" role Lennie; Peter Lorre as Kismet, a comic take on his many film noir roles; and cameo appearances by film noir regular Alan Ladd and Hope partner Bing Crosby. Sequences were filmed in San Francisco and Pebble Beach, California.\n\nThe story is told in flashback from Death Row as Ronnie Jackson (Bob Hope) relates to a group of reporters the events that lead to his murder conviction. Jackson is a San Francisco baby photographer who dreams about being a real private detective like his office neighbor Sam McCloud (Alan Ladd). One day he is mistaken for a detective by mysterious lady in distress Carlotta Montay (Dorothy Lamour), who claims that her wheelchair-bound husband was kidnapped at the pier as they arrived from overseas. A sinister figure (Lorre) listens at the office door. Carlotta gives Ronnie her address, and a coded map. Ronnie hides the map in the cups next to his office water cooler. Ronnie then drives to the address, which is a mansion down the Peninsula. Kismet (Peter Lorre) greets him at the door, lifting his handgun. Carlotta tells Ronnie that the missing man is her uncle, not her husband. He entered the country on some secret mission, she says. The mansion belongs to Major Montague, she says, who was a former partner of her uncle. Major Montague enters the room, and calls Carlotta away for a phone call. Major Montague also believes that Ronnie is a private detective, as he had Kismet follow him from the office. When Carlotta is out of the room, Montague tells Ronnie that Carlotta is mentally ill. He introduces Ronnie to a wheelchair-bound man in the next room as Carlotta's uncle, who tells Ronnie that he obviously has not been kidnapped. Ronnie tells Montague that Carlotta had given him a map to hold. Carlotta reenters the room, and when alone with Ronnie, tells him that the call was from her uncle, who told her he was safe. \"He was forced to make that call\", opines Carlotta. Now she suspects Montague, because he lied to Ronnie about her. She tells him to guard the map with his life.\n\nAs Ronnie leaves the mansion, he finds that his handgun is missing. Ronnie climbs up a tree and looks into a window, and sees the \"Uncle\" stand up out of the wheelchair and walk around the room. As Ronnie snaps a photo of this fake uncle through the keyhole, Kismet, who has followed him, throws a knife at him. Ronnie flees to his car and roars out of the mansion grounds. The others chase him by car and shoot out his tire. Ronnie runs into an apartment and intercoms himself in by saying that he is \"Joe\", and many women buzz him in.\n\nBack at his office, Ronnie develops the keyhole photo showing the \"Uncle\" walking about. Kismet has followed him there, and as Ronnie is calling the police, slugs him over the head, and burns the photo and what he thinks is the negative. When Ronnie comes to, a lady customer arrives to pick up her baby's photograph, and Ronnie gives her what he thinks is her baby's negative.\n\nRonnie summons the police and drives back to the mansion with them. The mansion is deserted, and Kismet poses as the gardener for the owners, who are out of the country. The police apologize to Kismet for the interruption. (This scene would be repeated years later by Alfred Hitchcock in his film \"North By Northwest\" with Cary Grant.) Montague gives Kismet Carlotta's ring with a note attached to leave as a 'clue' for Ronnie to discover. Ronnie returns to the mansion and finds the clue, which is a card for the Seacliffe Lodge in Carmel. Ronnie drives to the Lodge, which is really a sanitarium. After a bizarre golf match with an inmate and an imaginary golf ball, Ronnie is captured by the Montague gang and locked in a room at the sanitarium. Carlotta is also prisoner there. Montague explains that Carlotta's uncle had turned down his offer to buy mineral rights in some land. Carlotta's real uncle is then wheeled into the room to prove he is unhurt. He asks Carlotta to light his cigarette, then puts it out and gives her the cigarette. Ronnie refuses to reveal the whereabouts of the coded map, so Kismet slugs him. Carlotta tells them falsely that the map is in a water cooler cup at the Ferry Building, about an hour away. Montague sends a stooge to the Ferry Building to get the map. In her room Carlotta unwraps the cigarette from her uncle and the note on the paper says to see a 'James Collins', a scientist. Ronnie and Carlotta are able to knock out a nurse and flee from the sanitarium. Back at his office Ronnie gives Carlotta the map. They call James Collins' office and arrange to meet him at a restaurant that night. A stooge for the bad guys has followed them and overhears their arrangements.\n\nThey meet the scientist, James Collins, at the restaurant and show him the map. Collins says that he made the coded map, which depicts cryolite deposits from which uranium can be mined. He says that Carlotta's uncle had scheduled an important meeting with the government at the Pilgrim Hotel in Washington. Collins takes the map and Ronnie drives him to the police station. As Ronnie drives up to the police station, Kismet, who is hiding in the back seat with Ronnie's gun, shoots Collins and takes the map out of his pocket. Ronnie and the dead Collins are spotted by the police, and Ronnie flees the scene. He is now wanted for the Collins murder.\n\nCarlotta and a disguised Ronnie fly to Washington and go to the Pilgrim Hotel. They answer a help wanted ad and sign up as a bellboy and a maid at the hotel. In the gang's suite, they record the gang's confessions on a recording machine, including Kismet's confession that he murdered Collins. But when the police are called, Kismet switches the records and throws the incriminating record out the window. Montague points out to the police that Ronnie is wanted for the Collins murder in San Francisco. Ronnie is arrested and taken away; the gang still has the map and Carlotta's real uncle.\n\nThe flashback ends. Ronnie is on death row, and curses Carlotta for disappearing and not testifying at his trial for Collins' murder. When the prison warden comes to get Ronnie from his death row cell, Ronnie faints. When he comes to, Carlotta is there, and tells him that he is a free man. Ronnie had mistakenly given the keyhole photo negative to his customer. The photo from that negative revealed the uncle to be an impostor. Carlotta said that detective Sam took that lead, capturing the gang and 'the rest was routine'. Ronnie was cleared. Carlotta's uncle was saved.\n\nThe warden tells the executioner that the execution was cancelled. The executioner (Bing Crosby) curses and walks away. Ronnie and Carlotta embrace.\n\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" liked it, saying: \"Paramount knows a good thing when it sees one, especially when it earns a pile of bucks. And it also knows that there is magic in the juxtaposition of Mr. Hope and a dame—any dame this side of Woodlawn—and a preposterously turbulent plot. That's why the Paramount's new picture, the aforementioned \"My Favorite Brunette,\" which candidly observes these criteria, is a commendably funny film.\"\n\n\"My Favorite Brunette\" was described by a reviewer for the \"St. Petersburg Times\" as a \"first rate [Bob] Hope performance\".\n\nIn 1975, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.\n\n\"My Favorite Brunette\" has been widely Copyrighted By Columbia Pictures Television in 1986, under license from the Bob Hope estate and distributor FremantleMedia North America, using the original negatives stored at Sony. One such release was licensed to Shout! Factory in 2010 in a DVD box set with other Hope films.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2246991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246991", "title": "New Brighton A.F.C.", "text": "New Brighton A.F.C.\n\nNew Brighton Association Football Club is the name of two football clubs from the seaside resort of New Brighton, in Wallasey, Merseyside in England. The original club founded in 1921 were members of the Football League from 1923 until 1951, playing 21 seasons in Division 3 North but were disbanded in 1983. In 1993, a club with the same name was formed and played in the West Cheshire League, until folding in 2012.\n\nThe original New Brighton A.F.C. was formed in 1921 out of the ashes of the bankrupt South Liverpool. The club started life in the Lancashire Combination in 1921, assuming South Liverpool's membership, under the chairmanship of local GP Dr. Tom Martlew. They played at Sandheys Park, situated on Rake Lane between Osbourne Avenue and Penkett Road. It is thought that the location of this ground gave rise to the club's nickname, \"The Rakers\", which they kept for the rest of their existence.\n\nAfter two seasons, the club was elected to the Third Division North of the Football League when the division expanded to 22 clubs. They also played Football League games at Tower Athletic Ground (formerly home to New Brighton Tower) from 1946–51, after Sandheys Park was destroyed by Luftwaffe bombing during World War Two. The Sandheys Park bombsite subsequently was requisitioned for housing.\n\nIn Third Division North, the club's history was largely undistinguished. From 1924–28 Rakers managed top ten finishes, with the closest to promotion being a third-place finish in Season 1924/25, five points behind champions Darlington. After 1928, the club failed to finish in the top ten of the league for the rest of their existence.\n\nThe club reached the fourth round of the FA Cup on four occasions; firstly in 1925–26, when Notts County beat them 2–0 at Meadow Lane; in the 1927–28 season when they lost to Port Vale, in the 1937–38 season under WJ Sawyer when they lost to Tottenham Hotspur in a replay, and in the 1956–57 season, when as a non-League club, they beat three League clubs before losing to 9–0 away to first division leaders, Burnley.\n\nWith Sandheys Park badly damaged during a bombing raid in 1942, after World War II the club moved to the Tower Athletic Ground, the former home of New Brighton Tower. The club remained in the Third Division North until 1951, when they were voted out of the Football League after finishing bottom and replaced by Workington.\n\nIn these last years, the Rakers set one final record. On 15 March 1947, manager Neil McBain was forced to play in goal at Hartlepools; becoming the oldest player, at 51 years and 120 days, to feature in a Football League match. Rakers were beaten 3–0 in the game. As of June 2018 this record is still intact.\n\nThe club dropped into the Lancashire Combination, before switching to the Cheshire County League in 1965. In 1981 the club finished bottom of the Cheshire County League second division, and were not re-elected. By then they had left the Tower Athletic Ground and were playing in Hoylake at Carr Lane, the club owed money to the Inland Revenue and were forced to leave their ground in Hoylake which had seen much vandalism to its clubhouse.\n\nDespite a ground share with Newton FC from the West Cheshire League they failed to keep their Cheshire County League place, and it was too late to gain admission back into the West Cheshire League in which the Reserve side had played.\n\nHowever the club were accepted rather late into the South Wirral Premier Division for 1981–1982. This would prove a difficult season for them, losing players and ending up being relegated to the South Wirral First Division for season 1982–1983. The club was refused permission to build a ground in Leasowe Road not far from their former grounds.\n\nIn the club's final season (1982–83), it was run by Len Ainscow (Chairman), Gary Burns (Secretary and Press-Secretary) and Brian Oxton (Manager and Treasurer). Oxton resigned the club from the league, but this was quickly reversed by Gary Burns and a side was hastily put together that lost to Rake Social by 11–3, with Geoff Tolley in charge for one game. Oxton returned as Manager, but shortly afterwards New Brighton was heavily beaten by Rake Social and by the end of the season it was clear that the club could no longer function. Despite calls for more Committee/Directors, there was little response and the club was disbanded.\n\nA new club of the same name was formed in 1993, and joined the Birkenhead and Wirral League, which they won in their first season. In 1995 the club switched to the South Wirral League. After upgrading their new ground, the club were admitted to the Second Division of the West Cheshire League in 1996. The club won the Second Division in the 2004/5 season, and were promoted to the First Division. \n\nThe club joined the West Cheshire League in 1996-97. In 2005, the Rakers won the Second Division Championship and promotion to Division One. Their best season was in 2007-8 when they finished fifth in the West Cheshire top division. But in the 2008-9 season the first team was obliged to drop out of the top division, with their record being expunged. The following year, the first team took the place of the reserve team in the second division of the West Cheshire League. In their final season, the re-formed club finished just outside the promotion places, third in the Second Division.\n\nHowever, the new club also folded in the close season of 2012, having been unable to raise a new committee to replace the outgoing one. At present no senior team bears the name of New Brighton in league competition.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2247002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2247002", "title": "Zoo TV Tour", "text": "Zoo TV Tour\n\nThe Zoo TV Tour (also written as ZooTV, ZOO TV or ZOOTV) was a worldwide concert tour by rock band U2. Staged in support of their 1991 album \"Achtung Baby\", the tour visited arenas and stadiums from 1992 to 1993. It was intended to mirror the group's new musical direction on \"Achtung Baby\". In contrast to U2's austere stage setups from previous tours, the Zoo TV Tour was an elaborately staged multimedia spectacle, satirising television and media oversaturation by attempting to instill \"sensory overload\" in its audience. To escape their reputation for being earnest and overly serious, U2 embraced a more lighthearted and self-deprecating image on tour. Zoo TV and \"Achtung Baby\" were central to the group's 1990s reinvention.\n\nThe tour's concept was inspired by disparate television programming, coverage of the Gulf War, the desensitising effect of mass media, and \"morning zoo\" radio shows. The stages featured dozens of large video screens that showed visual effects, video clips, and flashing text phrases, along with a lighting system partially made of Trabant automobiles. The shows incorporated channel surfing, prank calls, video confessionals, a belly dancer, and live satellite transmissions with war-torn Sarajevo. On stage, Bono portrayed several characters he conceived, including the leather-clad egomaniac \"The Fly\", the greedy televangelist \"Mirror Ball Man\", and the devilish \"MacPhisto\". In contrast to other U2 tours, each of the Zoo TV shows opened with six to eight consecutive new songs before older material was played.\n\nComprising five legs and 157 shows, the tour began in Lakeland, Florida, on 29 February 1992 and ended in Tokyo, Japan, on 10 December 1993. The tour alternated between North America and Europe for the first four legs before visiting Oceania and Japan. After two arena legs, the show's production was expanded for stadiums for the final three legs, which were branded \"Outside Broadcast\", \"Zooropa\", and \"Zoomerang/New Zooland\", respectively. Although the tour provoked a range of reactions from music critics, it was generally well received. It was the highest-grossing North American tour of 1992, and overall sold around 5.3 million tickets and grossed US$151 million. The band's 1993 album, \"Zooropa\", was recorded during a break in the tour and expanded on its mass media themes. The tour was depicted in the Grammy Award-winning 1994 concert film \"\". Critics regard the Zoo TV Tour as one of rock's most memorable tours—in 2002, \"Q\"s Tom Doyle called it \"the most spectacular rock tour staged by any band\".\nU2's 1987 album \"The Joshua Tree\" and the supporting Joshua Tree Tour brought them to a new level of commercial and critical success, particularly in the United States. Like their previous tours, the Joshua Tree Tour was a minimalistic, austere production, and they used this outlet for addressing political and social concerns. As a result, the band earned a reputation for being earnest and serious, an image that became a target for derision after their much-maligned 1988 motion picture and companion album \"Rattle and Hum\", which documented their exploration of American roots music. The project was criticised as being \"pretentious\", and \"misguided and bombastic\", and U2 were accused of being grandiose and self-righteous. Their 1989 Lovetown Tour did not visit the United States, and at the end of the tour, lead vocalist Bono announced on-stage that it was \"the end of something for U2\" and that \"we have to go away and ... just dream it all up again\", foreshadowing changes for the group.\n\nOne of U2's inspirations for Zoo TV was a 1989 concert in Dublin that reached a radio audience of 500 million people and was widely bootlegged. Bono said the group were fascinated with the possibilities of radio and how they could be expanded using video to \"beam concerts into Peking or Prague for free\" or spawn \"video bootlegs in cultures where it's hard to get [U2's] music\". The wild antics of \"morning zoo\" radio programmes inspired the band with the notion of taking a pirate television station on tour. They were also interested in using video as a way of making themselves less accessible to their audiences. The band developed these ideas while recording \"Achtung Baby\" in Berlin at Hansa Studios. While in Germany, they watched television coverage of the Gulf War on Sky News, which was the only English programming available at their hotel. When they tired of hearing about the conflict, they tuned into local programming to see \"bad German soap operas\" and automobile advertisements. The band believed that cable television had blurred the lines between news, entertainment, and home shopping over the previous decade, and they wanted to represent this on their next tour.\n\nThe juxtaposition of such disparate programming inspired U2 and \"Achtung Baby\" co-producer Brian Eno to conceive an \"audio-visual show\" that would display a rapidly changing mix of live and pre-recorded video on monitors. The idea was intended to mock the desensitising effect of mass media. Eno, who was credited in the tour programme for the \"Video Staging Concept\", explained his vision for the tour: \"the idea to make a stage set with a lot of different video sources was mine, to make a chaos of uncoordinated material happening together... The idea of getting away from video being a way of helping people to see the band more easily ... this is video as a way of obscuring them, losing them sometimes in just a network of material.\"\nWhile on a break from recording, the band invited production designer Willie Williams to join them in Tenerife in February 1991. Williams had recently worked on David Bowie's Sound+Vision Tour, which used film projection and video content, and he was keen to \"take rock show video to a level as yet undreamed of\". The band played Williams some of their new music—inspired by alternative rock, industrial music, and electronic dance music—and they told him about the \"Zoo TV\" phrase that Bono liked. Williams also learned about the band's affection for the Trabant, an East German automobile that derisively became a symbol for the fall of Communism; he thought their fondness for the car was \"deeply, deeply bizarre\". In May, he brainstormed the idea to construct a lighting system of recycled Trabants. Williams, who \"always favored a very homemade approach to lighting, over an off-the-shelf one\", had previously fashioned fixtures from objects such as trash cans and furniture. He saw the Trabant as the perfect object to light U2's tour, envisioning it as a \"suitably surreal and symbolic scenic element\". On 1 June 1991, Williams visited the engineering department of Light & Sound Design (LSD) in Birmingham, England, to ask for help with building a prototype. \n\nOn 14 June, the first tour production meeting was held; in attendance were Williams, the band, their manager Paul McGuinness, artist Catherine Owens, and production managers Steve Iredale and Jake Kennedy. Williams presented his ideas, which included the Trabant lighting system and the placement of video monitors all over the stage; both notions were well received. Eno's original idea was to have the video screens on wheels and constantly in motion, although this was impractical. Williams and the group proposed many ideas that did not make it to the final stage design. One such proposal, dubbed \"Motorway Madness\", would have placed billboards advertising real products across the stage, similar to their placement beside highways. The idea was intended to be ironic, but was ultimately scrapped out of fear that the band would be accused of selling out. Another proposed idea was to build a giant doll of an \"achtung baby\", complete with an inflatable penis that would spray on the audience, but it was deemed too expensive and was abandoned.\n\nBy August, a prototype of a single Trabant for the lighting system was completed, with the innards gutted and retrofitted with lighting equipment, and a paint job on the exterior. Williams spent most of the second half of 1991 designing the stage. Owens was insistent that her ideas be given priority, as she thought that men had been making all of U2's creative decisions and were using male-centred designs. With the support of bassist Adam Clayton, she recruited visual artists from Europe and the United States to arrange images that would be used on the display screens. These people included video artist Mark Pellington, photo/conceptual artist David Wojnarowicz, and satirical group Emergency Broadcast Network, who digitally manipulate sampled image and sound. Pellington conceived the idea to flash text phrases on the visual displays, inspired by his collaborations with artists Jenny Holzer and Barbara Kruger. The concept was first put into practice in the video for \"Achtung Baby\"s lead single, \"The Fly\". Bono devised and collected numerous phrases during development of the album and the tour. Additional pre-recorded video content was created by Eno, Williams, Kevin Godley, Carol Dodds, and Philip Owens.\n\nOn 13 November, U2 settled on the \"Zoo TV Tour\" name and the plans to place video screens across the stage and build a lighting system out of Trabants. McGuinness led a trip to East Germany to buy Trabants from a recently closed factory in Chemnitz, and in January 1992, Catherine Owens began to paint the cars. As she described, \"The basic idea was that the imagery on the cars should have nothing to do with the car itself.\" One such design was the \"fertility car\", which sported blown-up newspaper personal ads and a drawing of a woman giving birth while holding string tied to her husband's testicles. Williams and Chilean artist Rene Castro also provided artwork for the cars.\n\nThe Zoo TV stages were designed by Willie Williams, U2's stage designer since the War Tour of 1982–1983. In place of U2's austere and minimalist productions of the 1980s, the Zoo TV stage was a complex setup, designed to instill \"sensory overload\" in its audience. The set's giant video screens showed footage of the band members performing, pre-recorded video, live television transmissions, and flashing text phrases. Electronic, tabloid-style headlines ran on scrawls at the ends of the stage. The band's embracing of such technology was meant as a radical departure in form, and as a commentary on the pervasive nature of technology. This led many critics to describe the show as ironic. \n\nTo enable such a complex video production, the equivalent of a television studio control room was built for the tour. Williams enlisted Carol Dodds to be video director based on their experience together on Bowie's Sound+Vision Tour and her familiarity with Vidiwalls from a Paula Abdul tour. Dodds operated the tour's \"custom-designed interactive video system\", and oversaw a crew ranging from 12 people on the arena legs to 18 for the \"Outside Broadcast\" leg. At the front of house position, the video crew conducted a live mix of the broadcast cameras filming the concert and live television transmissions intercepted by a satellite dish. In the production facility underneath the stage, dubbed \"Underworld\", engineers intercut the live video with pre-recorded imagery from LaserDisc players, video tape players, and a Philips CD-i player and routed it to the display screens. In all, content was compiled from 24 different video sources. \n\nPersonal computers were used to sequence specific pre-recorded video segments and distribute them to the proper outputs; the engineers could select one or many displays to which to output each content source, whether it be a single video cube or an entire screen. The computers' media controls allowed video content from the disc and tape players, either individual frames or entire sequences, to be sequenced, looped, and built into pre-programmed cues. On stage, guitarist the Edge used MIDI pedals to trigger music sequencers, generating SMPTE timecode for coordinating the video cues. Des Broadberry managed the keyboards, sequencers, samples, and MIDI equipment.\n\nDespite the production's complexity, the group decided that flexibility in the shows' length and content was a priority. The Edge said, \"That was one of the more important decisions we made early on, that we wouldn't sacrifice flexibility, so we designed a system that is both extremely complicated and high-tech but also incredibly simple and hands-on, controlled by human beings... in that sense, it's still a live performance.\" This flexibility allowed for improvisations and deviations from the planned programme. Eno recommended that U2 film their own video tapes so that they could be edited and looped on the video displays more easily, instead of relying entirely on pre-sequenced video. Eno explained: \"their show depends on some kind of response to what's happening at the moment in that place. So if it turns out they want to do a song for five minutes longer, they can actually loop through the material again so that you're not suddenly stuck with black screens halfway through the fifth verse.\" The band shot new video for the displays over the course of the tour.\n\nA catwalk extended from the main stage with a camera track laid on top of it, leading to a B-stage, a smaller, secondary performance area. Zoo TV was U2's first tour to use a B-stage; the band had pursued the idea on previous tours because Bono wanted proximity to the audience, but they had been unsuccessful due to building and fire code restrictions.\n\nEquipment for the sound system was provided by Clair Brothers Audio, which had been working with U2 since 1982. The company's S4 Series II speaker cabinet was the standard model used for Zoo TV; it was based on a prototype designed for the tour and featured built-in time-alignment. The sound engineers decided not to supplement the traditional public address system with delayed speakers for time-alignment, as they wanted the audience to focus their attention on the stage and the multimedia aspects of the show. The stage monitor system used on the Zoo TV Tour was one of the largest and most complex systems at the time. Through \"quad monitoring\", the monitor engineer used a joystick to pan each band member's mix around the monitor speakers to \"follow\" their positions on stage as they moved away from their dedicated monitors. The band members also wore in-ear monitors, which was necessitated by their performing on the B-stage, where they experienced an audio delay from the primary PA speakers behind them and where fewer monitor wedges could be positioned.\n\nLighting equipment was provided by LSD. Supplementing the traditional lighting rigs were several suspended Trabants that had been retrofitted with light fixtures. The cars were purchased for US$500–600 each, and when stripped of their interiors, they weighed . Approximately US$10,000 of lighting equipment weighing was installed in the vehicles. A 2.5K HMI Fresnel fixture was mounted to the metal bar that previously held the vehicle's backseat, and was fitted with an LSD ColourMag colour magazine and a dowser; a 5K fixture was originally used but had to be replaced after causing the car to melt after five minutes. Other fixtures installed were: a PAR-64 Ray Light reflector in the headlight bracket; two LSD Mirrorstrobes; eight Molefays behind the front bumper and four behind the rear; and ACL strips behind the radiator grid. Chain hoists were attached to brackets welded onto the wheel hubs, allowing the vehicles to be raised and tilted on their own axles.\n\nSeveral versions of the stage were used during the tour.\n\nThe first two legs of the tour in 1992 were indoors and used the smallest of the stages. The video system included four Philips Vidiwalls of video cubes, thirty-two monitors, and a projection screen center-hung from the front truss. The projection screen was used in lieu of an additional video cube wall that proved too costly; Williams called it the \"first of many such compromises\" during the tour. Dodds' video crew comprised 12 people: four camera operators, four staffers running computers in the front of house position, and four members underneath the stage controlling the video screens. Seven LaserDisc players were used. About of tracks were laid on top of the walkway to the B-stage for a camera dolly, which could reach a height of .\n\nFor the arena lighting system, six Trabants were suspended above the stage, and a seventh Trabant by the B-stage doubled as a DJ booth and a mirror ball. Williams originally planned to use 12 cars but scaled back after the tour's video production expanded. The remainder of the lighting system was minimal, comprising 17 spotlights and a \"couple of hundred\" PAR cans. The ColourMags were controlled by LSD's Simon Carus-Wilson, who had worked with Williams on the Sound+Vision Tour. Two lighting trusses were used to illuminate the audience, consisting of ACL wash fixtures for \"little pools of light\", eight fixtures to initially brighten the venue, and ultraviolet wash light. The video screens produced enough backlight that few other fixtures were needed for the opening two songs of concerts. The lighting system was controlled with an Avolites QM180 console.\n\nThe North American arena shows, many of which featured in-the-round seating, used 72 Clair Brothers S4 Series II speakers, in positions of stage left and right, rear fill stage left and right, and left and right sidefill. For the European arena shows, the number of S4 Series II speakers was reduced to 56, as rear fill and sidefill audio were not required. Clair Brothers' P4 \"Piston\" cabinets were also used for nearfield/in-fill audio, with two clusters of six speakers each at stage left and right. Bass was provided by six Servo Drive Bass Tech 7 subwoofers. The sound was mixed by sound engineer Joe O'Herlihy and assistant Robbie Adams with an ATI Paragon console and a Clair Brothers CBA console, aided by an inventory of effects intended to replicate the ones used in the studio during the recording of \"Achtung Baby\".\n\nThe stage monitor system was controlled underneath the stage with six consoles: two Harrison SM5s (with a 16-channel extender), a Yamaha DMP7, a Soundcraft 200B, and two Ramsa WS-840s for drummer Larry Mullen Jr. The consoles provided capabilities for around 200 audio channels. To avoid audio feedback during B-stage performances, O'Herlihy said, \"We 'ring' the system out using a separate EQ\". On stage, the monitor speakers consisted of Clair Brothers' 12AM single and double wedge units, with ML18 and MM4T units for sidefill. Steve McCale served as the monitor engineer for Bono, the Edge, and Clayton, and controlled the joystick panning, while Dave Skaff was Mullen's monitor engineer. In-ear monitors were provided by Future Sonics.\n\nThe production equipment was transported on 11 trucks supplied by Upstaging Trucking. The stage required 13–14 hours to build and 3–4 hours to disassemble. The crew of 75 people travelled on six buses, while the band flew in a chartered plane.\n\nTo redesign the stage for the 1992 North American stadium leg—dubbed \"Outside Broadcast\"—Williams collaborated with stage designers Mark Fisher and Jonathan Park, both of whom had worked on Steel Wheels Tour stage for the Rolling Stones. The main stage was expanded to be , and the catwalk leading to the B-stage was lengthened to approximately , nearly four times as long as the arena version. The spires of the stage, intended to resemble radio masts, reached as high as , requiring aircraft warning lights approved by the Federal Aviation Administration to be placed on top of them. The stage's appearance was compared to the techno-future cityscapes from \"Blade Runner\" and the works of cyberpunk writer William Gibson.\n\nThe video projection system consisted of four Vidiwalls, four rear projection screens using eighteen GE Talaria 5055 HB light valve projectors, and thirty-six Barco monitors. The production control system, which was operated by Dodds and a crew of 18 people, included ten Pioneer LDV8000 LaserDisc players, two Sony Betacam SP BVW-75 tape decks, two Sony 9800 -inch SP tape decks, four Ikegami HL-55A CCD cameras, two Sony Video8 Handycams (nicknamed \"Bonocams\"), and one point-of-view camera. The video equipment cost more than US$3.5 million.\n\nWilliams faced difficulties in designing the outdoor lighting system, as the stage did not have a roof. He settled on using the venues' house spotlights and strategically placing lights in the structure behind the band. About a third of the lighting equipment was lifted by a tower, requiring of ballast. Lighting was also provided by 11 Trabants; two were suspended from cranes while the others were supported by a hydraulic system.\n\nThe audio system for the larger stage used 176 speaker enclosures containing 312  woofers, 592  mid-range drivers, and 604 high-frequency drivers. The system used about one million watts of power and weighed . U2 were Clair Brothers' first client to use the company's nascent \"flying\" PA system, which designers were able to position behind the staging area. The front of house position featured three mixing stations, each with 40-channel capabilities. The stage monitor system used 60 speakers, which were mixed from two separate positions, each with two consoles providing 160-channel capacities. On stage, 26 microphones were used.\n\nThe North American stadium leg employed a 145-person production crew and 45-person staging crew that travelled on 12 buses and a 40-passenger chartered jet known as the Zoo Plane. Two separate steel sets were used during the tour; while one was use in for a concert, another was in transit to the next venue. The tour required 52 trucks to transport of equipment—12 trucks for each of the two steel sets and 28 for the production equipment. The concerts were powered by four generators and of cabling. Stage construction required more than 200 local labourers, 12 forklifts, and a , crane. The million-dollar stage was built in 40 hours and disassembled in six.\n\nThe outdoor stage used for the 1993 legs of the tour was smaller due to budget concerns, and it discarded the Trabants hung from cranes, instead featuring three cars hanging behind the drum kit. All of the projection screens were replaced with video cubes, as the projectors were not bright enough for the European summer nights when daylight lasted later. The resulting video system used three Digiwalls of projection cubes, four Vidiwalls (each 4 cubes high by 3 cubes wide), and thirty-six Barco monitors. Comprising 178 cubes, the three Digiwalls varied in orientation: 14 cubes high by 6 cubes wide, 9 high by 5 wide, and 7 high by 7 wide. Williams said the new video system was \"vastly superior\" and that the changes made Zoo TV \"the largest touring video facility ever created\". \n\nThe sound system utilised 144 Clair Brothers' S4 Series II cabinets positioned in \"two curved wings\". These speaker stacks were 38 feet behind the drum riser and 45 feet behind the primary vocal position. The layout allowed for sightlines of 250 degrees within stadiums. To help focus the sound, the engineers installed a semicircle of Clair Brothers' P4 cabinets, comprising four arrays of six cabinets each, around the perimeter of the stage. Additional P4 speakers were placed on their sides on the edge of the B-stage. Underneath Bono's position at the front of the main stage were 16 Servo Drive sub-bass units. The concert at Roundhay Park in Leeds was supplemented by time-delayed speaker towers from SSE Hire due to the venue's elongated shape, making it the only show on the tour to use delay speakers. For the monitor speaker system, Radio Station in-ear monitors were provided by Garwood Communications. The monitors were mixed on four Ramsa WS-840 consoles, with Skaff serving as the monitor engineer for Mullen and Clayton, and Vish Wadi for Bono and the Edge.\n\nThe European leg featured confetti cannons, provided by Shell Shock Firework Co. and JEM, that shot \"Zoo Ecu\" banknotes (which were substituted by \"Zooropa\" condoms in Ireland).\n\nRehearsals for the tour began in December 1991 at The Factory in Dublin. The band found it challenging to recreate all the sounds from the new album. They considered using additional musicians, but their sentimental attachment to a four-piece prevailed.\n\nThe tour was announced on 11 February 1992, less than three weeks before opening night. The opening leg consisted of 32 arena shows in 31 North American cities, from 29 February to 23 April. Four days after the tour announcement, tickets for some concerts first went on sale. While the band had toured North America every year between 1980 and 1987, they had been absent from the region's tour circuit for over four years before Zoo TV. The US concert business was in a slump at the time, and the routing of the first tour's two legs generally afforded only one show per city. This was intended to announce the band's return to major cities, to gauge demand for ticket sales, and to re-introduce the notion of a \"hot ticket\" to concertgoers. \n\nTicket sale arrangements varied from city to city, but in each case, a ticket limit per purchase was enforced. The band minimized the amount of shows for which tickets were sold at physical box offices, preferring to sell over the telephone instead. In cities where scalping was rampant, only telephone sales were offered, allowing ticket brokers to cancel duplicate orders. Tickets for the opening show on 29 February in Lakeland, Florida, sold out over the phone in four minutes, with demand exceeding supply by a factor of ten to one. Several cities' telephone systems were overwhelmed when Zoo TV tickets went on sale; Los Angeles telephone company Pacific Bell reported 54 million calls in a four-hour period, while Boston's telephone system was temporarily shut down.\n\nOn 19 February, the band departed Dublin for the US to prepare for the tour. While rehearsing in Lakeland for opening night, Eno consulted U2 on the visual aspects of the show. Unlike many of the group's previous tours, which began ahead of or coincident with the release of a new album, Zoo TV started four months after \"Achtung Baby\" was released, giving fans more time to familiarise themselves with the new songs. By opening night, the album had already sold three million copies in the US and seven million worldwide.\n\nDetails of the second leg of the tour were first released on 30 April with the announcement of four UK arena shows. Ticketing details were kept secret until radio advertisements announced that tickets had gone on sale at box offices. In many cases, tickets were limited to two per person to deter scalping. Due to the production costs and relatively small arena crowds, the European arena leg lost money. McGuinness had planned larger outdoor concerts in Berlin, Turin, Poland, and Vienna to help the tour break even, but only the Vienna concert occurred.\n\nPlans for stadium shows were first mentioned by Iredale in March 1992, but not confirmed until the 23 April announcement of the \"Outside Broadcast\" leg in North America. It was accompanied by details of two concerts, for which tickets went on sale two days later. While U2 were motivated to play stadiums by pragmatic concerns, they saw it as an artistic challenge as well, imagining what artists Salvador Dalí or Andy Warhol would have done with such spaces. Rehearsals for \"Outside Broadcast\" began in Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey, Pennsylvania, on 2 August 1992. To accommodate fans who had been camping outside the venue to listen, the band held a public dress rehearsal concert on 7 August, with half-price tickets benefiting five local charities. Technical problems and pacing issues forced refinement to the show. On 5 August, six days before the official leg-opening concert at Giants Stadium, the group delayed the show by a day, due to the difficulty of assembling the large outdoor production. By the time \"Outside Broadcast\" began, \"Achtung Baby\" had sold four million copies in the US. \nTickets for the \"Zooropa\" leg went on sale in November 1992. The leg, which began in May 1993, was U2's first full stadium tour of Europe and marked the first time they had visited certain areas. For the \"Zoomerang\" leg, the band faced difficulties with booking concerts in Sydney, Australia, where they wanted to stage a worldwide television broadcast to end the tour. In early August 1993, after the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust rejected the band's application to perform at the Sydney Football Stadium in November, Bono publicly questioned the city's viability as a candidate to host the 2000 Summer Olympics; the trust's decision was made despite allowing concerts by Madonna and Michael Jackson to be held at Sydney Cricket Ground in November. McGuinness faxed all 29 members of the Sydney Olympics 2000 Bid Committee to inform them of the situation. John Fahey, the Premier of New South Wales, personally intervened to allow the Sydney concerts to take place, and an announcement was made on 15 August confirming them. Tickets for the Sydney and Melbourne shows went on sale on 23 August. Scheduling for the \"Zoomerang\" leg afforded the band more off-days between shows than previous legs, but this amplified the exhaustion and restlessness that had set in by the tour's end.\n\nAlthough Zoo TV was listed as co-sponsored by MTV, the group decided against explicit corporate sponsorship. The daily cost of producing the tour was US$125,000, regardless of whether a show was held on a given day. Band members, especially Mullen, were uncertain that the tour would be profitable. One of their chief concerns was how to procure Philips's costly Vidiwalls, which were priced at US$4–5 million. No rental company owned the video screens. McGuinness instead lobbied for Philips to provide the equipment at no cost; since U2 were signed to Island Records, which was owned by Philips subsidiary PolyGram, McGuinness and the band thought there was natural corporate synergy to Philips providing the equipment for a PolyGram artist's tour. PolyGram CEO Alain Levy was unable to convince Philips to help, and the band had to pay for the Vidiwalls themselves; Levy did convince PolyGram to contribute about US$500,000 to the tour as gesture of goodwill. In order to defray the heavy expenses of the Pacific shows, U2 asked for large guarantees from local promoters up front, rather than sharing the financial burden as they had in the past. This sometimes caused promoters to raise ticket prices above usual levels, which in turn sometimes resulted in less than full houses. Profit margin was a slim four to five per cent at most sold-out shows.\n\nBetween the support acts and U2's performance, a disc jockey played records. For the 1992 legs, Irish rock journalist and radio presenter BP Fallon filled the role. Originally hired to write the Zoo TV tour programme, he played music from inside a Trabant on the B-stage, while providing commentary and wearing a cape and top hat. His official title was \"Guru, Viber and DJ\". He hosted \"Zoo Radio\", a November 1992 distributed radio special that showcased select live performances, audio oddities, and half-serious interviews with members of U2 and the opening acts. At the group's suggestion, Fallon published a book about the tour entitled \"U2 Faraway So Close\". Later on the tour, he was replaced by Paul Oakenfold, who became one of the world's most prominent club DJs by the decade's end, and Colin Hudd. For the 1993 concerts, U2 invited Irish theatre group Macnas to join the tour and perform between the support acts. The troupe wore oversized papier-mâché heads of the members of U2 and playacted a miming parody of them. Writer Bill Flanagan described the performances as \"the jesters mocking the kings\".\nBeginning with the group's 24 May 1992 show, Fallon played \"Television, the Drug of the Nation\" by hip-hop artists the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy as the last song before the lights were turned off and U2 took the stage. The band believed that the song, a commentary on mass media culture, encapsulated some of the tour's principal themes. The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy became one of the supporting acts for the \"Outside Broadcast\" leg, and after their supporting stint, \"Television\" was retained as the pre-show closing song for the remainder of the tour. \n\nAfter the venue darkened, one of several audio-video pieces was played to accompany the group taking the stage. During the \"Outside Broadcast\" leg, the piece was one by Emergency Broadcast Network that manipulated video clips of American President George H. W. Bush to give the impression of him singing Queen's song \"We Will Rock You\". A different piece, created by Ned O'Hanlon and Maurice Linnane of Dreamchaser video productions, was used on the 1993 legs. This introduction reflected U2's growing concern with the volatile political situation in post-communist Europe and the resurgence of radical nationalism at the time. It featured footage from Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda films \"Triumph of the Will\" and \"Olympia\", mixed with sounds from \"Lenin's Favourite Songs\", Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, and voices asking \"What do you want?\" in different European languages. A visual of the flag of Europe was presented which then crumbled after one of the stars fell off. \n\nThe concert began with a fixed sequence of six to eight consecutive \"Achtung Baby\" songs, a further sign that they were no longer the U2 of the 1980s. For the opening song, \"Zoo Station\", Bono entered as his primary stage persona, \"The Fly\", appearing silhouetted against a giant screen of blue and white video noise interwoven with glimpses of xerox animations of the band members. \"The Fly\" was usually performed next, with the video monitors flashing a rapidly changing array of textual words and aphorisms. Some of these included \"Taste is the enemy of art\", \"Religion is a club\", \"Ignorance is bliss\", \"Watch more TV\", \"Believe\" with letters fading out to leave \"lie\", and \"Everything you know is wrong\". (During the first week of the tour, media outlets incorrectly reported that the words shown included \"Bomb Japan Now\", forcing the band to issue a statement denying the claim.) Before \"Even Better Than the Real Thing\", Bono channel surfed through live television programming, and during the song, as random images from television and pop culture flashed on screen, he filmed himself and the rest of the band with a camcorder.\n\nIn a \"Zoo Radio\" interview, the Edge described the visual material that accompanied the first three songs:\n\n\"Mysterious Ways\" featured a belly dancer on-stage, tempting Bono and dancing just out of his reach. Initially, Floridian fan Christina Petro filled the role. After appearing outside the venue of the band's final dress rehearsal in a belly-dancing outfit, the crew invited her inside to dance with Bono to lighten the mood. The group liked their interaction and that it made reference to the belly dancer in the song's music video, and she accepted an invitation to join the tour. For the \"Outside Broadcast\" leg, tour choreographer Morleigh Steinberg took over the role. Performances of \"One\" were accompanied by the title word shown in many languages, as well as Mark Pellington-directed video clips of buffalos leading to a still image of David Wojnarowicz's \"Falling Buffalo\" photograph. For \"Until the End of the World\", Bono often played with a camera, kissing the lens and thrusting it into his crotch, a stark contrast from his more earnest stage behaviour of the past. Beginning with \"Outside Broadcast\", the band began playing \"New Year's Day\" afterwards. During \"Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World\", Bono danced with a young female fan from the crowd (a ritual he had done more solemnly on past tours), shared camcorder video filming duties with her, and sprayed champagne. At this point in the show, Mullen sometimes sang a solo performance of \"Dirty Old Town\".\n\nThe group played many \"Achtung Baby\" songs very similarly to the way they had appeared on record. Since this material was complex and layered, most numbers featuring pre-recorded or offstage percussion, keyboard, or guitar elements underlying the U2 members' live instrumentals and vocals. The band had used backing tracks in live performance before, but with the need to sync live performance to Zoo TV's high-tech visuals, almost the entire show was synced and sequenced. This practice has continued on their subsequent tours.\nZoo TV was one of the first large-scale concerts to feature a B-stage, where performances were intended \"to be the antidote to Zoo TV\". The idea had been inspired by the successful informality of the Elvis Presley \"68 Comeback Special\". Here, the band played quieter songs, such as acoustic arrangements of \"Angel of Harlem\", \"When Love Comes to Town\", \"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\", and Lou Reed's \"Satellite of Love\". Many critics compared the B-stage performances to \"busking\" and singled them out as the shows' highlights.\n\nAfter leaving the B-stage, U2 often played \"Bad\" or \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", with performances of \"Bullet the Blue Sky\" and \"Running to Stand Still\" following. For \"Bullet the Blue Sky\", the video screens displayed burning crosses and swastikas. During \"Running to Stand Still\", Bono mimed the actions of a heroin addict from the B-stage, rolling up his sleeves and then pretending to spike his arm during the final lyric. Afterwards, red and yellow smoke flares ignited from either end of the B-stage, before the band re-grouped on the main stage to play older songs with more sincerity. \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was accompanied by sped-up video of the group in the desert from \"The Joshua Tree\"s photo shoot. U2 often finished their set with \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" while a clip from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famed \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\" speech was played on the video screens. The group was initially unconvinced that the leap from the rest of the show's irony and artifice to something more sincere would be successful, but they thought that it was important to demonstrate that certain ideals were so strong and true that they could be held onto no matter the circumstance. The group alternated between performing \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" acoustically on the B-stage and using it to conclude the main set.\n\nBeginning with the \"Outside Broadcast\" leg, footage from the tour's \"video confessional booth\" was displayed on the video screens during the intermission. Before each concert, fans were encouraged to visit the booth—a converted chemical toilet near the mix station—and record a 20-second confession. The video crew would then edit together the confessional footage to broadcast later that evening before the encore. The \"confessions\" varied from a woman flashing her breasts to a man revealing he had injured people in a drunk-driving accident. The inspiration for the video confessional came the day before the \"Outside Broadcast\" leg officially began.\n\nFor encores, Bono returned to the stage as a different alter ego—Mirror Ball Man in 1992, and MacPhisto in 1993. Performances of \"Desire\" were accompanied by images of Richard Nixon, Margaret Thatcher, Paul Gascoigne, and Jimmy Swaggart, and were meant as a criticism of greed; cash rained the stage and Bono portrayed Mirror Ball Man as an interpretation of the greedy preacher described in the song's lyrics. Bono often made a crank call from the stage as his persona of the time. Such calls included dialing a phone sex line, calling a taxi cab, ordering 10,000 pizzas (the Detroit pizza parlor delivered 100 pizzas during the show), or contacting a local politician. Bono regularly called the White House in an attempt to contact President Bush. Though Bono never reached the President, Bush did acknowledge the calls during a press conference.\n\n\"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)\" and \"With or Without You\" were frequently played afterwards. Concerts initially ended with \"Achtung Baby\"s slower \"Love Is Blindness\". Beginning with the \"Outside Broadcast\" shows, it was often followed by Bono's falsetto take on Elvis Presley's long-time show-closing ballad, \"Can't Help Falling in Love\", culminating in Bono softly stating that \"Elvis is still in the building\". Both songs presented a low-key, introspective conclusion to the show, in contrast to the dynamic, aggressive opening; the group also wanted to move away from its tradition of ending concerts with the fan sing-along favourite \"40\". The night finished with a single video message being displayed: \"Thanks for shopping at Zoo TV\".\n\nThe following setlists are representative of the tour's average setlist, according to Setlist.fm, which has logged the setlist from each concert during the tour.\n\nOn 11 June 1992, Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA appeared on-stage in Stockholm for the first time in years to perform \"Dancing Queen\" with the band, which U2 had frequently performed on the tour up to that point. Other guest performers on the tour included Axl Rose, Jo Shankar, and Daniel Lanois.\n\nOn 19 June 1992, during the European indoor leg, U2 played the \"Stop Sellafield\" concert in Manchester, alongside Kraftwerk, Public Enemy, and Big Audio Dynamite II, to protest the operation of a second nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield. The following morning, U2 and other protesters participated in a demonstration against the facility organised by Greenpeace. Wearing white radiation suits, the band members landed on the beach at Sellafield in rubber dinghies and placed a line of 700 placards on the shore spelling out \"React – Stop Sellafield\" for the waiting media.\n\nAt the first \"Outside Broadcast\" show on 12 August 1992 at Giants Stadium, Lou Reed performed \"Satellite of Love\" with the band; he and Bono dueted using their contrasting vocal styles. Bono re-confirmed the singer's influence on the band by announcing, \"Every song we've ever written was a rip-off of a Lou Reed song.\" For the second show and the remainder of the tour, a taping of Reed singing the song was used for a virtual duet between him and Bono.\n\nNovelist Salman Rushdie joined the band on stage in London's Wembley Stadium on 11 August 1993, despite the death fatwā against the author and the risk of violence arising from his controversial novel \"The Satanic Verses\". In reference to the novel's satanic references, Rushdie, when confronted by Bono's MacPhisto character, observed that \"real devils don't wear horns\". In 2010, Clayton recalled that \"Bono had been calling Salman Rushdie from the stage every night on the Zoo TV tour. When we played Wembley, Salman showed up in person and the stadium erupted. You [could] tell from Larry's face that we weren't expecting it. Salman was a regular visitor after that. He had a backstage pass and he used it as often as possible. For a man who was supposed to be in hiding, it was remarkably easy to see him around the place.\"\n\nBono assumed a number of costumed alter egos during Zoo TV performances. The three main personae that he used on stage were \"The Fly\", \"Mirror Ball Man\", and \"MacPhisto\". During performances of \"Bullet the Blue Sky\" and \"Running to Stand Still\", he also appeared on stage wearing a military utility vest and cap, and a microphone headset. As this character, he ranted and raved in an act he said was set in the Vietnam War.\n\nTo escape their reputation for being overly serious and self-righteous, U2 decided to alter their image by being more facetious. Bono said, \"All through the Eighties we tried to be ourselves and failed when the lights were on. Which is what set us up for Zoo TV. We decided to have some fun being other people, or at least other versions of ourselves.\" The Edge said, \"We were quite thrilled at the prospect of smashing U2 and starting all over again.\" The group viewed humour as the appropriate response to their negative perception and that although their message would not change, they needed to change how they delivered it to their audience.\n\nBono conceived his \"Fly\" persona during the writing of the song of the same name. The character began with Bono wearing an oversized pair of blaxploitation sunglasses, given to him by wardrobe manager Fintan Fitzgerald, to lighten the mood in the studio. Bono wrote the song's lyrics as this character, composing a sequence of \"single-line aphorisms\". He developed the persona into a leather-clad egomaniac, describing his outfit as having Lou Reed's glasses, Elvis Presley's jacket, and Jim Morrison's leather trousers. To match the character's dark fashion, Bono dyed his naturally-brown hair black.\n\nBono began each concert as The Fly and continued to play the character for most of the first half of the concert. In contrast to his earnest stage persona of the 1980s, as The Fly, Bono strutted around the stage with \"swagger and style\", exhibiting mannerisms of an egotistical rock star. He adopted the mindset that he was \"licensed to be an egomaniac\". He often stayed in character away from the tour stage, including for public appearances and when staying in hotels. He said, \"That rather cracked character could say things that I couldn't\", and that it offered him a greater freedom of speech.\n\nAs the Mirror Ball Man, Bono dressed in a shining silver lamé suit with matching shoes and cowboy hat. The character was meant to parody greedy American televangelists, showmen, and car salesman, and was inspired by Phil Ochs' Elvis persona from his 1970 tour. Bono said that the character represented \"a kind of showman America. He had the confidence and charm to pick up a mirror and look at himself and give the glass a big kiss. He loved cash and in his mind success was God's blessing. If he's made money, he can't have made any mistakes.\" As the character, Bono spoke with an exaggerated Southern US accent. Mirror Ball Man appeared during the show's encore and made nightly prank calls, often to the White House. Bono portrayed this alter ego on the first three legs of the tour, but replaced him with MacPhisto for the 1993 legs.\n\nMacPhisto was created to parody the devil and was named after Mephistopheles of the Faust legend. Initially called \"Mr. Gold\", MacPhisto wore a gold lamé suit with gold platform shoes, pale makeup, lipstick, and devil's horns on his head. As MacPhisto, Bono spoke with an exaggerated upper-class English accent, similar to that of a down-on-his-luck character actor. The character was created as a European replacement for the American-influenced Mirror Ball Man. The initial inspiration for MacPhisto came from the stage musical \"The Black Rider\". The character was realised during rehearsal the night before the first 1993 show. According to Bono, \"We came up with a sort of old English Devil, a pop star long past his prime returning regularly from sessions on The Strip in Vegas and regaling anyone who would listen to him at cocktail hour with stories from the good old, bad old days.\" MacPhisto sang the closing \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" in an oddly childlike manner that many reviewers found one of the most poignant moments of the show.\n\nAs MacPhisto, Bono continued his routine of making in-concert prank calls that had begun with Mirror Ball Man, and he changed his targets with the location of each show. Many of them were local politicians who Bono wished to mock by engaging them in character as the devil. Among his victims were the Archbishop of Canterbury, Helmut Kohl, Bénédict Hentsch, the Pope, Alessandra Mussolini, Hans Janmaat, Bernard Tapie, John Gummer, and Jan Henry T. Olsen. Bono enjoyed making these calls, saying, \"When you're dressed as the Devil, your conversation is immediately loaded, so if you tell somebody you really like what they're doing, you know it's not a compliment.\" The band intended MacPhisto to add humour while making a point. The Edge said: \"That character was a great device for saying the opposite of what you meant. It made the point so easily and with real humor.\" A female Cardiff fan who was pulled on-stage questioned Bono's motives for dressing as the devil, prompting the singer to compare his act to the plot of the C. S. Lewis novel \"The Screwtape Letters\".\n\nSeveral European shows in 1993 featured live satellite link-ups with people living in Sarajevo as the city was sieged during the Bosnian War. The transmissions were arranged with help from American aid worker Bill Carter. Before their 3 July show in Verona, the band met with Carter to give an interview about Bosnia for Radio Televizija Bosne I Hercegovina. Carter described his experiences helping Sarajevans while surviving the dangerous conditions. While in Sarajevo, Carter had seen a television interview on MTV in which Bono mentioned the theme of the \"Zooropa\" leg was a unified Europe. Carter felt such an aim was empty if Bosnia went overlooked, and so he sought Bono's help. He requested that U2 visit Sarajevo to bring attention to the war and break the \"media fatigue\" that had occurred from covering the conflict. Bono wanted the band to play a concert in the city, but their tour schedule prevented this, and McGuinness believed that a concert there would make them and their audience targets for the Serbian aggressors.\n\nInstead, the group agreed to use the tour's satellite dish to conduct live video transmissions between their concerts and Carter in Sarajevo. Carter returned to the city and was able to assemble a video unit. The band had to purchase a satellite dish to be sent to Sarajevo and had to pay a £100,000 fee to join the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Once set up, the band began satellite link-ups to Sarajevo on a near nightly basis, the first one airing on 17 July 1993 in Bologna. To connect with the EBU satellite feeds, Carter and two co-workers had to traverse \"Sniper Alley\" at night to reach the Sarajevo television station, and they had to film with as little light as possible to avoid the attention of snipers. This was done ten times over the course of a month. Carter discussed the deteriorating situation in the city, and Bosnians often spoke to U2 and their audience. These grim interviews deviated from the rest of the show, and they were completely unscripted, leaving the group unsure of who would be speaking or what they would say. U2 stopped the broadcasts in August 1993 after learning that the siege of Sarajevo was being reported on the front of many British newspapers. Though this trend had begun before the first link-up, Nathan Jackson suggested that U2's actions had brought awareness of the situation to their fans, and to the British public indirectly.\n\nReactions to the transmissions were mixed, triggering a media debate concerning the ethical implications of mixing rock entertainment with human tragedy. The Edge said: \"A lot of nights it felt like quite an abrupt interruption that was probably not particularly welcomed by a lot of people in the audience. You were grabbed out of a rock concert and given a really strong dose of reality and it was quite hard sometimes to get back to something as frivolous as a show having watched five or ten minutes of real human suffering.\" Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. In 2002, he said: \"I can't remember anything more excruciating than those Sarajevo link-ups. It was like throwing a bucket of cold water over everybody. You could see your audience going, 'What the fuck are these guys doing?' But I'm proud to have been a part of a group who were trying to do something.\" During a transmission to the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo told Bono via satellite: \"We know you're not going to do anything for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die.\" Some people close to the band joined the War Child charity project, including Brian Eno. Flanagan believed that the link-ups accomplished Bono's goal for Zoo TV of \"illustrating onstage the obscenity of idly flipping from a war on CNN to rock videos on MTV\". U2 vowed to perform in Sarajevo someday, eventually fulfilling this commitment on their 1997 PopMart Tour.\n\nU2 recorded their next album, \"Zooropa\", from February to May 1993 during an extended break between the third and fourth legs of the tour. The album was intended as a companion EP to \"Achtung Baby\", but soon expanded into a full LP. Recording could not be completed before the tour restarted, and for the first month of the \"Zooropa\" leg, the band flew home after shows, recording until the early morning and working on their off-days, before travelling to their next destination. Clayton called the process \"about the craziest thing you could do to yourself\", while Mullen said of it, \"It was mad, but it was mad good, as opposed to mad bad.\" McGuinness later said the band had nearly wrecked themselves in the process. The album was released on 5 July 1993. Influenced by the tour's themes of technology and mass media, \"Zooropa\" was an even greater departure in style from their earlier recordings than \"Achtung Baby\" was, incorporating further dance music influences and electronic effects. Songs from the album were incorporated into the subsequent \"Zooropa\" and \"Zoomerang\" legs, most frequently \"Numb\" and \"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\". For the \"Zoomerang\" leg, \"Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car\" and \"Lemon\" were added to the encore and \"Dirty Day\" to the main set.\n\nOn 9 September 1992, a portion of U2's performance at the Pontiac Silverdome was broadcast live to the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards. The band performed \"Even Better Than the Real Thing\" while VMA host Dana Carvey, dressed as his Garth persona from \"Wayne's World\", accompanied the band on drums in Los Angeles. A \"Zoo Radio\" special included live selections from 1992 shows from Toronto, Dallas, Tempe, and New York City. On 28 and 29 November 1992, a television special entitled \"Zoo TV Featuring U2\" was aired, featuring portions of several \"Outside Broadcast\" leg shows as well as William S. Burroughs' reading of the sardonic poem \"Thanksgiving Prayer\". Directed by Kevin Godley, the programme was broadcast in North America on Fox, and in Europe via Channel 4, Premiere, France 2, Rai Uno, RTVE, TV1000, and Veronica. Several 1992 shows, including the 11 June concert in Stockholm and 27 October concert in El Paso, were broadcast into the homes of fans who had won contests. In October 1992, U2 released \"Achtung Baby: The Videos, The Cameos, and a Whole Lot of Interference from Zoo TV\", a VHS compilation of nine music videos from \"Achtung Baby\". Interspersed between the music videos were clips of so-called \"interference\", comprising documentary footage, media clips, and other video similar to what was displayed on tour.\n\nTwo November 1993 \"Zoomerang\" shows in Sydney were filmed on consecutive nights as part of a worldwide television broadcast. The 26 November concert was staged as a rehearsal for the production crew in advance of the official filming the following night. However, Clayton, who began drinking excessively on the latter stages of the tour, was unable to perform on 26 November after experiencing an alcoholic blackout. The band ruled out canceling the show, since it was the only opportunity for the production crew to do a dry run of the filming. Bass guitar technician Stuart Morgan filled in for Clayton instead, marking the first time a member of U2 had missed a concert since their earliest days. Clayton recovered in time to play the 27 November show, which was broadcast in the United States on tape-delayed pay-per-view. U2 originally planned to produce the concert with MTV for a January 1994 \"triplecast\" that would have offered three different perspectives of the show on three separate television channels. After realising they had not fully developed the concept, the group cancelled the \"triplecast\", denying themselves income that was supposed to make the Pacific leg of the tour profitable. The show was subsequently released as the concert video \"\" in 1994, and the double CD \"Zoo TV Live\" in 2006 to subscribing members of U2's website. The video won the Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.\n\nReviews written during the initial arena legs reflected the dramatic change in U2's approach. Many critics published favourable reviews about the tour. The \"San Francisco Chronicle\" praised the special effects for supplementing the music. The reviewer wrote, \"The often-surrealistic effects always served the songs, not the other way around.\" The review concluded, \"this magnificent multimedia production will serve as a pinnacle in rock's onstage history for sometime to come\". Edna Gundersen of \"USA Today\" said that U2 was dismantling its myth and wrote that the show was \"a trippy and decadent concert of bedazzling visuals and adventurous music\". \"Melody Maker\"s Jon Wiederhorn wrote that he expected to dislike the show based upon their past stage history, \"But, alas, I cannot be negative about U2 tonight. Their Zoo TV show is visually stunning, musically unparalleled, downright moving and, dammit, truly entertaining.\" \"Hot Press\" Bill Graham said of the show, \"U2 don't so much use every trick in the book as invent a whole new style of rock performance art.\" For Graham, the tour resolved any doubts he had about the band—particularly about Bono—following their reinvention with \"Achtung Baby\".\n\nOther critics indicated befuddlement as to U2's purpose. The \"Asbury Park Press\" wrote that the long string of \"Achtung Baby\" song presentations that opened the show made one forget about the band's past, and that \"almost everything you knew about U2 a couple years ago is, in fact, wrong now\". \"The Star-Ledger\" said that the band shortchanged its music with its video presentations and that especially during the opening sequence, \"one was only aware of the music as a soundtrack to the real 'show'\". It concluded by saying that the group had lost the sense of mystery and yearning that made it great and that they had succumbed to the style of music videos. Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" acknowledged that U2 was trying to break its former earnest image and that they were a \"vastly improved band\" for being \"trendy\" and \"funny\"; yet, he commented, \"U2 wants to have its artifice and its sincerity at the same time—no easy thing—and it hasn't yet made the breakthrough that will unite them.\"\n\nThe stadium legs of the tour received more consistent praise than the arena shows. Critics noted that while the show and its setlist were largely the same as before, the tour mostly benefited from the increased scale. The \"New York Daily News\" said that the stage \"looked like a city made of television sets—an electronic Oz\" and that \"glitz was used not as a mere distraction (as it has been by so many video-age artists), but as a determined conceit\". Gundersen also made the comparison to Oz, saying that even though the band was dwarfed by the setting, their adventurous musicianship still shone through. She concluded that the group had \"deliver[ed] a brilliant high-wire act\" between mocking and exploiting rock music clichés, a comparison also made by stage designer Willie Williams. Robert Hilburn of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said of the outdoor American leg, \"Zoo TV is the yardstick by which all other stadium shows will be measured.\" David Fricke of \"Rolling Stone\" said that the band had \"regained critical and commercial favor by negotiating an inspired balance between rock's cheap thrills and its own sense of moral burden\". He praised the band for \"retool[ing] themselves as wiseacres with heart and elephant bucks to burn\". Fricke noted that the increased visual effects for the \"Outside Broadcast\" leg increased the shows' \"mind-fuck\" factor. Many critics described the tour as \"post-modern\". The writers of \"Rolling Stone\", in a best-of-1992 issue, named U2 co-winners of \"Best Band\", while awarding the Zoo TV Tour honours for both \"Best Tour\" and \"Worst Tour\".\n\n\"The Independent\" praised the \"Zooropa\" leg, with the reviewer stating, \"I came as a sceptic, and left believing I had witnessed the most sophisticated meeting of technical wizardry and mojo priestcraft ever mounted.\" Dave Fanning of \"The Irish Times\" praised the \"Zooropa\" leg, stating, \"If this is the show by which all other rock circuses must be measured, then God help the new music.\" Fanning observed that the group, particularly Bono, exhibited \"style, sex and self-assurance\". \"Billboard\" wrote, \"No one is dancing on the edges of rock'n'roll's contradictions as effectively these days as U2.\" The stadium legs had their detractors, as \"NME\" called the shows a \"two-hour post-modernist Pot Noodle advert made by politically naive, culturally unaware squares with the help of some cool, arty people\". Graham thought that the scale of the stadium shows led to more predictability and less interaction with the audiences.\n\nThe group and the music industry were unsure how fans would receive the tour beforehand. During the first week of shows, Bono said, \"This show is a real roller coaster ride, and some people will want to get off, I'm sure.\" He remained optimistic that their devoted fans would continue following them, but cautioned he had no intention of resisting the glamour and fame: \"Oh, but it's \"fun\" to be carried away by the hype. Where would you be without the hype?... You can't pretend all the promotion and all the fanfare is not happening.\" Some hardcore fans, particularly in the US, objected to the tour as a blatant sellout to commercial values, while others misinterpreted the tour's mocking of excess, believing that, according to \"VH1's Legends\", \"U2 had 'lost it' and that Bono had become an egomaniac\". Many Christian fans were offended by the band's antics and believed they had abandoned their religious faith.\n\nBy the outdoor legs, many fans knew what to expect, and Pareles observed that Bono's admonitions to never cheer a rock star were greeted with idolatrous applause; he concluded that the show's message of scepticism was somewhat lost on the audience and that, \"No matter what Bono tells his fans, they seem likely to trust him anyway.\" By the end of the tour's first year, U2 had won over many fans. In a 1992 end-of-year poll, readers of \"Q\" voted U2 \"The Best Act in the World Today\". The band's almost clean sweep of \"Rolling Stone\"s end-of-year readers' poll—which included \"Best Artist\", \"Best Tour\", and Bono as \"Sexiest Male Artist\"—reconfirmed for the magazine they were the \"world's biggest rock band\".\n\nOn the opening leg of the tour, U2 grossed US$13,215,414 and sold 528,763 tickets to 32 shows. Sources gave varying box office figures for the band's entire 1992 North American itinerary; \"Pollstar\" reported that they grossed US$67 million from 73 shows, while \"Billboard\" reported that they grossed US$72,427,148 and sold 2,482,802 tickets to 77 concerts. \"Pollstar\"s reported gross figure was the highest amount by any touring artist that year, and at the time was the third-highest gross for a North American tour, behind the Rolling Stones' 1989 Steel Wheels Tour and New Kids on the Block's 1990 Magic Summer Tour. U2's three sold-out shows in Foxborough, Massachusetts, grossed US$4,594,205, ranking fourth on \"Amusement Business\"s list of top boxscores for 1992. Zoo TV sold 2.9 million tickets that year for North America and Europe combined.\n\nThe \"Zooropa\" stadium leg in 1993 played to more than 2.1 million people over 43 dates between 9 May and 28 August. In total, the Zoo TV Tour sold about 5.3 million tickets, and reportedly grossed US$151 million. The band incurred heavy expenses to produce the tour, leading to only a small profit. On the tour's final stop in Japan, McGuinness confirmed that T-shirt sales, which had topped 600,000 in North America in 1992, drove Zoo TV's profitability: \"We grossed $30 million in T-shirt sales. Without those we'd be fucked.\" Bono later said: \"When we built Zoo TV, we were so close to bankruptcy that if 5% fewer people went, U2 was bankrupt. Even in our irresponsible, youthful and fatal disregard of such material matters, it was terrifying.\"\n\nAt the 1992 \"Billboard\" Music Awards, U2 won for the No. 1 Boxscore Tour. For the \"Pollstar\" Concert Industry Awards of 1992, the band were honoured for the Most Creative Stage Production, and were nominated for Most Creative Tour Package and Major Tour of the Year. For their work on the Zoo TV Tour, Willie Williams and Carol Dodds won an award for Designer of the Year/Lighting at the 1992 Lighting Dimensions International Awards.\n\nFor the Zoo TV Tour, U2 embraced the \"rock star\" identity they had struggled with and were reluctant to accept throughout the 1980s. They drew the attention of celebrities, including American presidential candidate Bill Clinton, and they began partying more than they had in the past. During parts of the tour, the band attracted the fashion crowd; Clayton's romantic relationship with supermodel Naomi Campbell and Bono's friendship with supermodel Christy Turlington made them the subjects of unwanted tabloid attention. In May 1993, Campbell announced that she and Clayton were engaged, but by the \"Zoomerang\" leg, their relationship was fracturing and he was drinking frequently. After missing the group's 26 November 1993 show in Sydney from an alcoholic blackout, Clayton resolved to quit drinking altogether. The incident resulted in tensions within the group during the tour's final weeks as they contemplated whether to reallocate their revenues, which to that point had been split evenly five ways between the band members and McGuinness. Clayton's relationship with Campbell ended in 1994, but another member of U2 found love during the tour. The Edge became close with Morleigh Steinberg during her stint as the tour's choreographer and belly dancer. She moved to Dublin in 1994 to be with him, and they married in 2002.\n\nThe tour's two-year length, then U2's longest, exhausted the band as the final legs unfolded. Following the conclusion of Zoo TV, U2 took an extended break from recording as a group. Mullen and Clayton moved to Manhattan, where they sought out music lessons to become better musicians. The Edge and Bono spent most of 1994 living in newly renovated houses in the South of France. The Edge said, \"as a band I think [the tour] stretched us all. We were a different band after that and touring was different.\" Producer Nellee Hooper later told Bono that Zoo TV \"ruined irony for everyone\".\n\nThe Fly and MacPhisto characters appeared in the animated music video to U2's 1995 song \"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\" from the soundtrack to \"Batman Forever\". Author Višnja Cogan wrote that \"the video crystallises and concludes the Zoo TV period and the changes that occurred\" during that time. Director Joel Schumacher attempted to create a role for Bono as MacPhisto in \"Batman Forever\", but both later agreed it was not suitable. In the years following the Zoo TV Tour, Bono continued to wear sunglasses in public, leading to it becoming one of his signature trademarks. In October 2014, Bono said that the reason he continued to wear sunglasses was because he suffers from glaucoma.\n\nThe Pixies' stint as a support act caused a controversy that partially contributed to their breakup. In July 1992, \"Spin\" featured a cover story titled \"U2 On Tour: The Story They Didn't Want You to Read\", which detailed author Jim Greer's travels on the tour's first weeks with his unidentified girlfriend (who turned out to be Pixies' bassist Kim Deal). The article featured their criticisms of U2 for the supposed poor treatment the Pixies received. Both groups disagreed and were livid at Deal, particularly Pixies frontman Black Francis. In 1993, following tensions within the group, Francis announced the Pixies had dissolved.\n\nAs the tour drew to a close, U2 entered prolonged discussions about creating a Zoo TV television channel in partnership with MTV. This never materialised, but in 1997, MTV ran a brief miniseries called \"Zoo-TV\", which featured Emergency Broadcast Network extending their tour role in creating contemporary surrealist satirical video. U2 endorsed the effort as a representation of what the tour would have been like as a news magazine, but their direct role was limited to providing half-financing and outtakes from the \"Zooropa\" album. \"Wired\" magazine said the series \"pushe[d] the edge of commercial—even comprehensible—television\".\n\nU2's subsequent concert tour, 1997's PopMart Tour, followed in Zoo TV's footsteps by mocking another social trend, this time consumerism. Paul McGuinness said the group wanted \"the production [of PopMart] to beat Zoo TV\", and accordingly, the tour's spectacle was a further shift away from their austere stage shows of the 1980s; PopMart's stage featured a LED screen, a golden arch containing the sound system, and a mirrorball lemon that served as a transport to the B-stage. Although critics were much less receptive to PopMart, in a 2009 interview, Bono said that he considers that tour to be their best: \"Pop(Mart) is our finest hour. It's better than Zoo TV aesthetically, and as an art project it is a clearer thought.\"\n\nIn 2005, during their Vertigo Tour, the group often played a short set of songs as a homage to the Zoo TV Tour—\"Zoo Station\", \"The Fly\", and \"Mysterious Ways\"—as part of the first encore; performances of \"Zoo Station\" included the interference in the background visual effects, and \"The Fly\" used flashing text effects on the LED screens similar to the Zoo TV visuals.\n\nBono reprised the MacPhisto character during the band's 2018 Experience + Innocence Tour, using an augmented reality camera filter applied to his face. The band's creative team gave the character a new appearance after envisioning how 25 years of hard living would have changed him. As MacPhisto, Bono commented on sociopolitical events and movements of the time such as the Charlottesville rally. He punctuated these monologues by saying, \"when you don't believe that I exist, that's when I do my best work\".\n\nCritics regard the Zoo TV Tour as one of rock's most memorable tours. During the \"Zooropa\" leg of the tour, Guy Garcia of \"Time\" called Zoo TV \"one of the most electrifying rock shows ever staged\". In 1997, Robert Hilburn wrote that \"It's not unreasonable to think of it as the \"Sgt. Pepper's\" of rock tours.\" In 2002, Tom Doyle of \"Q\" called it \"still the most spectacular rock tour staged by any band\", and in 2013, the magazine listed it as one of the \"ten greatest gigs of all time\". In 2009, critic Greg Kot said, \"Zoo TV remains the finest supersized tour mounted by any band in the last two decades.\" Ryan Dombal of \"Pitchfork\" wrote in a review of \"Achtung Baby\"s 20th anniversary reissue, \"Even 20 years on, the tour looks like something to behold, a singularly inventive experience that no band—including U2 itself—has been able to really expound upon in a meaningful way.\" \"Rolling Stone\" included the tour on its 2017 list of \"The 50 Greatest Concerts of the Last 50 Years\".\n\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

He was a professor at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. \nHe was associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting. His art was influenced by the Norse mythology themes also found in works by Nils Blommér (1816–1853) and Carl Wahlbom (1810-1858). \n\nBorn in Stockholm, Mårten Eskil Winge was the son of the rector and vicar Isaac Martin Winge and Andrietta Sophia Rothman. Winge was educated at the Uppsala Cathedral School, passing his studentexamen in 1846, after which he became an apprentice in painting with P. E. Wallander in Stockholm. The following year, he enrolled in the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts. While studying there, he worked at the post office and painted portraits for additional income. He had become interested in the Old Norse sagas while growing up, and during his studies his elaborate drawings on Norse topics attracted attention. Among other things, he illustrated \"Nordens Guder\" by Danish poet and playwright Adam Oehlenschläger (1779–1850) and Crown Prince Charles's poems \"Fosterbröderna\" (1848) \"Heidi, Gylfes dotter\" (1852) and \"En vikingasaga\" (1855). He was also attracted to Gothicismus, the movement in Sweden under the influence of national romanticism to reclaim the Norsemen as heroic ancestors; together with his fellow student and friend, August Malmström (1829–1901), he revived motifs from Norse history and legends.\n\nIn 1856 Winge became a student of Johan Christoffer Boklund (1817–1880) in the newly established school of painting at the Royal Swedish Academy. The following year he received a Royal Medal for his painting of King Charles X at the death bed of \nAxel Oxenstierna (1583–1654), and received a three-year stipend that enabled him to take a field trip by way of Düsseldorf to Paris, \nwhere he studied with Thomas Couture (1815–1879) and where he visited the Louvre to copy Peter Paul Rubens' \"The Wise Men in Bethlehem\". The stipend was extended for a further three years, and in 1859 he made a trip to Rome before returning to Sweden in 1863.\n\nIn 1864 Winge became a member of the Academy of Arts and eventually, after various jobs as a drawing teacher, a professor. In 1865 he opened a school of painting in his studio and in 1877 he returned to Italy. Rome gave him great artistic experiences and inspiration.\n\nWinge created several paintings on Norse legendary and mythological topics in the 1860s, which attracted much interest and approval. For the first after his return to Sweden, \"Hjalmar's farewell to Örvar-Oddr after the Battle of Samsø\", Charles XV, now king, assisted with the landscape. His \"Thor's Fight with the Giants\" (1872), deemed a \"typical 19th-century image of the Thunder God\", was commissioned and bought by Charles XV, who also bought \"Kraka\" (1862). It is in the collection of the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, where Winge painted eight of the portraits of artists for the ceiling.\n\nBeginning in the 1870s, he was commissioned to produce altarpieces for several churches. He also painted decorations for the Bolinderska palace (today part of the Grand Hôtel in Stockholm) and for Kulla Gunnarstorp Castle in Scania. In his last years he made several paintings of waves breaking on the sea shore. \n\nIn 1867, he married textile artist Hanna Winge, née Tengelin (1838–1896). She was a genre painter and co-founder of a craftsmen's association, Friends of Handicraft. He died during 1896 in Enköping.\n\n"}

A settlement arose next to the castle, which acquired city rights in 1403 from King Władysław II Jagiełło.\n\nIn 1629 on the east side of the town king Sigismund III Vasa founded the \"New Town\" also called \"Konstancja\" (after the king's second wife). Nowadays it is a part of Odolanów named \"Górka\". At the end of the 17th century there were 18 shoemakers, 8 tailors, 3 millers, 3 tradesmen and 9 other craftsmen in the town. The majority of the population were tilthing and breeding cattle.\n\nUntil 1793, the town and surrounding villages belonged to princes, kings, or noblemen. Monarchs granted land to various rich feudals as fief or land tenancy. During this time, Odolanów was under the administrative influence of Kalisz.\n\nIn 1793 Odolanów became Prussian as a result of the second partition of Poland, and shortly within the Duchy of Warsaw.\n\nThe citizens took part in the Spring of Nations, fighting against better armed Prussians in the battle of Odolanów on 21 April 1848. They also supported the Polish January Uprising of 1863, delivering weapons and clothes to the insurgents.\n\nDespite the germanisation led by the German Empire, Odolanów preserved its Polish character – in 1910 at least 72.5% of inhabitants were speaking Polish. In addition to Poles, Jews and Germans also lived there. The Protestant church built in 1780 and the 1835 synagogue are monuments of Odolanów’s once multicultural society.\n\nIn 1909 the rail connection between Odolanów and Ostrów Wielkopolski was opened.\n\nThe events shortly after World War I (Republic of Ostrów and the Greater Poland Uprising) are an important part of the town’s history. On 12 November 1918, as a result of the November Revolution in Germany, a \"Worker’s and Soldier’s Council\" was established in the town. Some days later the citizens elected deputies to the Polish Parliament in the Prussian Partition (Polski Sejm Dzielnicowy). On 31 December 1918 Poles took power in Odolanów from Germans as part of the Greater Poland Uprising. Insurgents from Odolanów fought a. o. in the battle of Granowiec during the night of 14/15 January 1918. \nIn 1919 the town became part of the Second Polish Republic.\n\nOn 1 September 1939 Odolanów was quickly captured by the Wehrmacht. The German administration was using terror, many Poles were expropriated, killed or sent to concentration camps. The German occupation in Odolanów was over on 22 January 1945, when Soviet tanks entered the town. Some soldiers of the Polish underground continued their resistance, now against the Soviet dominance and the puppet Stalinist government (so-called cursed soldiers). On 22 October 1945 the troop of Jan Kempiński, nom de guerre \"Błysk\", operating in the Odolanów area was smashed by the Department of Security forces.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2247016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2247016", "title": "Proletarianization", "text": "Proletarianization\n\nIn Marxism, proletarianization is the social process whereby people move from being either an employer, unemployed or self-employed, to being employed as wage labor by an employer. Proletarianization is often seen as the most important form of downward social mobility.\n\nFor Marx, the process of proletarianization was the other side of capital accumulation. The growth of capital meant the growth of the working class. The expansion of capitalist markets involved processes of primitive accumulation and privatization, which transferred more and more assets into capitalist private property, and concentrated wealth in fewer and fewer hands. Therefore, an increasing mass of the population was reduced to dependence on wage labor for income, i.e. they had to sell their labor power to an employer for a wage or salary because they lacked assets or other sources of income. The materially-based contradictions within capitalist society would foster revolution. Marx believed the proletariat would eventually overthrow the bourgeoisie as the 'last class in history'.\n\nThe classic historical study of proletarianization is E.P. Thompson's \"The Making of the English Working Class\" (1963), in which the author portrays the meanings, struggles and conditions of an emerging proletariat. Many intellectuals have described proletarianization in advanced capitalism as \"the extension of the logic of factory labor to a large sector of services and intellectual professions.\" In most countries, entitlement to unemployment benefits is conditional on actively looking for work, and that means people, assuming they are not sick, are \"compelled\" to seek employment either as a salaried worker or as a self-employed worker. Geographically and historically, the process of proletarianization is closely associated with urbanization because it has often involved the migration of people from rural areas where they engaged in subsistence farming, family farming and sharecropping to the cities and towns, in search of waged work and income in an office or factory (see rural flight).\n\nA rather different explanation of proletarianization is that given by the historian Arnold J. Toynbee in his \"A Study of History\" Toynbee regards proletarianization as the tendency of elite or dominant groups in societies in crisis to gradually abandon their own cultural traditions and adopt those of their own dominated proletariats as well as their external foes. He provides extensive examples across various civilizations of the workings of this process in history. Some well-known instances include the indulgence of Roman emperors such as Nero, Commodus, and Caracalla in popular displays or habits abominated by the elite historians who recorded them. Thus, unlike the Marxist conception of proletarianization discussed above, which speaks of the abasement of the working class by the dominant capitalists, Toynbee's proletarianization happens without planning and sometimes despite the dislike or opposition of the ruling groups, because it involves influence of the proletarians on the dominant rather than the reverse.\n\n\n\n"}

Gorman\n\nRudolph Carl Gorman (July 26, 1931 – November 3, 2005) was a Native American artist of the Navajo Nation. Referred to as \"the Picasso of American Indian artists\" by \"The New York Times\", his paintings are primarily of Native American women and characterized by fluid forms and vibrant colors, though he also worked in sculpture, ceramics, and stone lithography. He was also an avid lover of cuisine, authoring four cookbooks, (with accompanying drawings) called \"Nudes and Food\".\n\nRudolph Carl Gorman was born in Chinle, Arizona. His mother was Adele Katherine Brown and his father Carl Nelson Gorman. \nHis father, Carl, was one of the original twenty-nine Navajo Code Talkers. He, with his colleagues, developed the unbreakable code American forces used in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Carl later studied at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles and was a technical illustrator for Douglas Aircraft. He also founded a silk-screen design company and taught Indian art at the University of California at Davis. [World War II].\n\nR. C. Gorman grew up in a traditional Navajo hogan and began drawing at age 3. His grandmother helped raise him, recounting Navajo legends and enumerating his genealogy of artist ancestors. She kindled his desire to become an artist. While tending sheep in Canyon de Chelly with his aunts, he used to draw on the rocks, sand, and mud, and made sculptures with the clay, with his earliest subjects including Mickey Mouse and Shirley Temple.\n\nHe credited a teacher, Jenny Lind at Ganado Presbyterian Mission School, for his inspiration to become a full-time artist. After he left high school, he served in the United States Navy before entering college, where he majored in literature and minored in art at Northern Arizona University.\n\nIn 1958, he received the first scholarship from the Navajo Tribal Council to study outside of the United States, and enrolled in the art program at Mexico City College. There he learned of and was influenced by the work of Diego Rivera. He later studied art at San Francisco State University, where he also worked as a model.\n\nGorman moved from California to New Mexico, opening the Navajo Gallery in Taos in 1968. It was the first Native American-owned art gallery.\n\nIn 1973, he was the only living artist whose work was shown in the “Masterworks of the American Indian\" show held at Metropolitan Museum in New York City. One of his pieces was selected for the cover of the exhibit's catalog.\n\nGorman's work was explored in a series on American Indian artists for the Public Broadcasting System (PBS). Other artists in the series included Helen Hardin, Charles Loloma, Allan Houser, Joseph Lonewolf, and Fritz Scholder.\n\nIn 1998, he donated art for Tom Udall's campaign for election to the U.S. House of Representatives. On April 1, 2003, Gorman donated his personal library to Diné College at the request of the college's president, Cassandra Manuelito-Kerkvliet.\n\nOn September 18, 2005, Gorman fell at his home and was taken to Holy Cross Hospital in Taos. On September 26, he was transferred to University of New Mexico Hospital (in Albuquerque). He died at age 74 on November 3. New Mexico governor Bill Richardson ordered flags flown at half-staff in his honor.\n\nGorman learned about the work of the Mexican social realists: Diego Rivera, David Siqueiros, and Rufino Tamayo. He became inspired by their colors and forms to change from abstraction to abstract realism. He used abstract forms and shapes to create his own unique, personal realistic style, recognizable to all who are acquainted with his work. While in Mexico, he also learned stone lithography from a master printer, Jose Sanchez. He used lithography throughout his life as a means of making original multiple images of his inspirations, often working by drawing directly on the stones from which the lithographs were printed.\n\n\n"}

From 1922 until his death on board a Kriegsmarine U-Boat in 1940, he remained a senior member and chief of staff of the IRA, while it divided and was outlawed, and removed itself to the political fringe of Irish society.\n\nBorn in Fairview, Dublin in 1893, Russell joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913. He participated in the 1916 Easter Rising as an officer in Dublin Brigade's 2nd Battalion, under Thomas MacDonagh. Following the Rising he was interned in Frongoch and Knutsford. After the Irish War of Independence began, he was attached to the IRA General Headquarters Staff (GHQ) and became IRA Director of Munitions in 1920. During the Irish Civil War, he fought against the Anglo-Irish Treaty with the Anti-Treaty IRA. In 1925, after the civil war, he was jailed in Mountjoy Prison but escaped on 25 November in a breakout he helped organise.\n\nRussell was one of those within the much-reduced IRA pushing for more revolutionary activities in 1926. That year, he and Gerald Boland travelled to the Soviet Union on an IRA weapons-buying mission. On his return from Moscow, Russell reported back to Seán Lemass. He was appointed IRA quartermaster general in 1927 and held that position until 1936. From 1929 to 1931, he travelled widely throughout Ireland, reorganising the IRA. Russell was due to give the oration at the 1931 Bodenstown commemoration but was arrested on its eve.\n\nHe visited the United States in the autumn of 1932. During the Northern Ireland rail strike of 1933, he organised IRA intervention from Belfast. Russell remained aloof from the IRA's political debates and, following the split of 1934, chaired the court-martial of Mick Price and Peadar O'Donnell who had left the IRA to form the left wing Republican Congress. He met Éamon de Valera, President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State at Government Buildings during 1934.\n\nWhile in the United States during 1936, he seems to have conceived, along with Joseph McGarrity, the plan for the bombing campaign in England. In January 1937, Russell was accused by the IRA leadership of misappropriating funds and was court martialled. He had also embarked on his American tour without Army Council permission. He stayed out of Dublin until October 1937, when he approached the IRA leadership in an attempt to convince them that the campaign in England should go ahead. In April 1938, an IRA General Army Convention was held, and Russell and his supporters, including McGarrity and IRA members from Northern Ireland, secured enough support to get a majority on the IRA Army Executive, and to have him re-instated in the organisation and elected to the Army Council. That has been described as a \"take over\" by historian Brian Hanley. After becoming IRA chief of staff, he put into motion the bombing campaign and forged links with Nazi Germany. During the summer of 1938, the IRA held training classes in explosives throughout the country.\n\nIn January 1939, claiming to be the legitimate government of the Irish Republic, the Army Council under Russell's leadership declared war on the United Kingdom in alliance with Nazi Germany. The Sabotage Campaign commenced some days later with bombing attacks on a number of English cities. Russell was also involved in a meeting with German Intelligence (Abwehr) agent Oscar Pfaus.\n\nTo pursue the propaganda arm of the S-Plan, Russell travelled to the United States in April 1939. The aim of his journey was to 'show the flag' and place himself in the public mind as the leader of militant Irish nationalism. While there Russell made several public addresses. He was trailed by Federal Bureau of Investigation \"G-Men\" at the request of Scotland Yard, and then detained by the United States Immigration Service at the Detroit border with Windsor, Ontario during the American visit of King George VI. The incident immediately aroused enormous indignation among Irish-Americans, culminating in a protest by seventy-six Irish-descended members of Congress. They demanded an explanation from President Roosevelt about the 'Russell Case', failing which they would not participate in the Congressional reception for the King.\n\nWhile in the United States, Russell met with his Clan na Gael host Joseph McGarrity and Robert Monteith, one of Casement's colleagues in 1916 and, at that time, director of Father Charles Coughlin's National Union for Social Justice. Anxious to skip his bail, which expired on 16 April, Russell made contact, through the offices of McGarrity, with German agent 'V-Rex', also known as Carl Rekowski. 'V-Rex' contacted John McCarthy, a steward on the steamer \"George Washington\", berthed in Tampa, Florida. The \"George Washington\" then sailed to then-neutral Italy. McCarthy met Abwehr agent, 'Professor' Franz Fromme, in Genoa on 19 and 30 March 1940. That meeting arranged for Russell's journey across the Atlantic, arrival in Genoa on 1 May, and reception in Berlin four days later.\n\nOnce in Berlin, Russell was informed of Operation Mainau, the plan to parachute Hermann Görtz into Ireland. Russell was asked to brief Görtz on Ireland before his departure that night, but missed his takeoff from the Kassel-Fritzlar airfield. Russell's liaison officer while in Nazi Germany was SS-Standartenfuhrer Edmund Veesenmayer. This was at a time when the IRA's viewpoint was extremely pro-Nazi and anti-semitic . Veesenmayer (often referred to as \"Hitler's coup d'etat specialist\" and a \"Jew exterminator\") indicated particular interest that the IRA had no clear idea of what form an Irish government would take in the event of a German victory. \n\nBy 20 May 1940, Russell began training with Abwehr in the use of the latest German explosive ordnance. That training was conducted at the Abwehr training school/lab at Quentzgut near Brandenburg, which specialised in the design of explosives as everyday objects. Russell also visited the training area for the Brandenburg Regiment, the 'Quenzgut', where he observed trainees and instructors working with sabotage materials in a field environment. As he received explosives training, his return to Ireland with a definite sabotage objective was planned by German Army Intelligence. His total training time with German Intelligence was over three months.\n\nOn 15 July 1940, Frank Ryan – an IRA man who had fought on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War and was captured by Franco forces – was handed over to the Abwehr and taken to Germany. The capture of the German agents from Operation Lobster I did not prevent Abwehr Chief Canaris sanctioning the transport of Russell to Ireland. Both Russell and Frank Ryan, who had arrived in Berlin on 4 August, departed from Wilhelmshaven on 8 August, aboard \"U-65\" – the mission was titled Operation Dove (\"\"Unternehmen Taube\"\" in German).\n\nRussell became ill during the journey and complained of stomach pains. The crew of \"U-65\" did not include a doctor and Russell died on 14 August, short of Galway. He was buried at sea and the mission was aborted. Following the return of the submarine to Germany, an inquiry was set up by the Abwehr into Russell's death. The inquiry included the interrogation of \"U-65\"'s crew and Frank Ryan. The conclusion was that Russell had suffered a burst gastric ulcer and, without medical attention, he had died.\n\nA number of conspiracy theories arose around the subject of Russell's death, including that he was poisoned on board the ship, shot by the British Secret Service in France, or murdered by Kurt Haller. However, Russell's brother, Patrick, confirmed after the war that Russell suffered from pre-existing stomach problems and, as a result, did not drink alcohol.\n\nRussell became the idol of traditionalist republicanism during the 1950s, and a memorial to him was unveiled by Cumann Uaigheann Na Laochra Gael, (the National Graves Association group), in Fairview Park in September 1951. A prominent role in the ceremony was taken by Cathal Goulding and other participants included Brendan Behan and Ruairí Ó Brádaigh (see). The group claims its mission is to \"restore, where necessary, and maintain fittingly the graves and memorials of our patriot dead of every generation\".\n\nRussell's legacy is deeply contested. Both Sinn Féin and Republican Sinn Féin continue to commemorate him as an Irish patriot. Others condemn him as a Nazi collaborator. It had been said he \"cared little for Nazi ideology\" and he was accused of being a communist spy. Irish historian Brian Hanley suggests that Russell was not a Nazi but concludes that his letters to his German contacts \"betray astonishing political naiveté\". In September 2003, then Sinn Féin MEP, Mary Lou McDonald, spoke at a rally to commemorate Russell held at the site of the memorial. The same rally was also addressed by then Provisional IRA Army Council member Brian Keenan who said:\n\nIn July 1953, the raised right arm was broken off by right-wing radicals, who explained the vandalism by claiming the arm had been raised in a communist salute rather than oratorical pose. The damaged arm was replaced posed downward instead of raised. The 31 December 2004 attack saw the decapitation of the memorial by an unnamed group, described by the \"Sunday Independent\" as anti-fascist. The memorial's right forearm was also removed. A statement issued to the press in justification of the vandalism read (verbatim):\n\nThe missing pieces of the memorial were not recovered. A spokesman for The National Graves Association announced that the memorial to Seán Russell would be rebuilt in more permanent bronze to deter vandals. In May 2009, the plinth was cleaned and the new bronze was erected. Allegedly, the new statue has alarms to detect attempted vandalism, as well as a GPS tracker.\n\nOn 9 July 2009, the plinth of the memorial was again vandalised with graffiti proclaiming Russell to have been a Nazi.\n\n\n\n"}

Of the league's seven teams, the Boston Bruins were the best in the 48-game regular season, but the Stanley Cup winners were the New York Rangers, who defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in the best-of-seven final series 4–2 for their third Stanley Cup in 14 seasons of existence. It would be another 54 years before their fourth.\n\nIn June 1939, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association notified the NHL of the request for development fees when signing amateur players to contracts, after the existing professional-amateur deal expired in 1940.\n\nTragedy struck the Montreal Canadiens when Babe Siebert, named coach of the struggling club, drowned along with his daughter in August. It put a big hole in the Habs defence and the team finished last under Pit Lepine. An all-star benefit was held in Siebert's memory.\n\nThe New York Americans, in financial trouble, decided to trade their star left wing \nSweeney Schriner to Toronto for Harvey \"Busher\" Jackson, Buzz Boll, Murray Armstrong, and minor-leaguer Jimmy Fowler. Late in the season, they traded Eddie Wiseman and $5000 to Boston for Eddie Shore. The Americans then managed to make the playoffs by finishing a poor sixth. They also obtained Charlie Conacher and used him as a defenceman.\n\nThe first place Boston Bruins had a new coach in Cooney Weiland, their one-time captain, and were once again led by their Kraut Line, Milt Schmidt, Woody Dumart, and Bobby Bauer as they finished 1–2–3 in overall league scoring. Unfortunately, the potent three were unable to help the Bruins get past the first round of the playoffs as the Bruins lost in six games to the Rangers.\n\nThe New York Rangers were coasting in first place and went 19 consecutive games without a loss.\nThey slumped in the second half, though, and Boston edged them out for first place.\n\nThe first NHL game broadcast on television was between the New York Rangers and Montreal Canadiens on February 25, 1940. The game was seen by only 300 people in a small area in the United States. This, though, was not the first ice hockey game broadcast on television, as a broadcast had been made in England in 1938. The CBC's first hockey broadcast was in 1952 between the Montreal Canadiens and Detroit Red Wings.\n\nThe Boston Bruins were expected to make the Stanley Cup Finals after a first overall finish during the regular season riding the shoulders of the \"Kraut Line\". But the New York Rangers were too much for the Bruins who lost in six games, out-scored 14 to 8 and shut-out twice, in the Semifinals. The third seed Toronto Maple Leafs swept the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Black Hawks en route to the Stanley Cup Finals. The Rangers Cup win would begin the 54 Year Curse, and they would not win another Cup until 1994.\n\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points\"\n\nSource: NHL\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played; Min – Minutes Played; GA = Goals Against; GAA = Goals Against Average; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; SO = Shutouts\"\n\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty Minutes\"\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played; Min – Minutes Played; GAA = Goals Against Average; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; SO = Shutouts\"\n\nThe following is a list of players of note who played their first NHL game in 1939–40 (listed with their first team, asterisk(*) marks debut in playoffs):\n\nThe following is a list of players of note that played their last game in the NHL in 1939–40 (listed with their last team):\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2247080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2247080", "title": "Catemaco", "text": "Catemaco\n\nCatemaco () is a city in Catemaco Municipality located in the south of the Mexican state of Veracruz. The city is located on Lake Catemaco, with the municipality stretching north to the Gulf of Mexico. Catemaco is a tourist destination with its main attractions being the lake, remnants of the region's rainforest and a tradition of sorcery/witchcraft that has its roots in the pre Hispanic period and mostly practiced by men. This tradition is well known in Mexico and attracts clients from various walks of life, including businessmen and national level politicians. Catemaco holds an annual event in March dedicated to sorcery which can draw up to 5,000 visitors.\n\nThe city of Catemaco is located in southern Veracruz, about 160 km from the port of Veracruz and 220 km from the state capital of Xalapa. It is located inland, extending 2.5im along the shore of Lake Catemaco, a large freshwater lake, which is one of the city's main tourist attractions, along with its cuisine and its tradition of sorcery. Along the lake, the city has a 1.5 km breakwater/boardwalk, which is frequently crowded with both visitors and vendors, especially those selling charms and a local freshwater snail called tegogolo. The city's docks are located in the center of this area, classified as a fishing and tourism port by the federal government. Most of the boat traffic is for tourism, especially during vacation periods.\n\nThe other main section of the city is the main plaza, popular with both residents and visitors. The main structure here is the Basilica of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Veneration of this version of the Virgin Mary, the patroness of the municipality, began in the early colonial period, as a substitute for the local worship of Chalchiuhtlicue, the goddess of water and fishermen. This basilica contains an image of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which has been credited with miracles. It is rivaled in devotion only by a shrine on an island in Lake Catemaco called El Tegal, where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared. The current structure was begun in 1799 but was not finished until 1961. The church is a combination of Baroque and Neoclassical with a cupola 21 meters high. The surrounding stained glass windows depict the lives of Jesus and Mary. Each year, Our Lady of Mount Carmel is celebrated at this basilica, a launching of boats in procession to Agaltepec Island and traditional music including danzón, Son Jarocho and other tropical music, using guitars, violins, the vihuela and double bass.\n\nOther landmarks in the city include the Statue of the Fisherman, the Torre del Reloj (Clock Tower), the Brizuela Absalón House, the Gasca Blanco House and the Herrera García House. The Casa de los Tesoros is a large gift shop, which offers bagels, bizcochos and Mexican handcrafts and folk art.\n\nThere is a bus station principally connecting the city with the ports of Veracruz and Coatzacoalcos.\n\nCatemaco is known in Mexico for its community of “\"brujos\"\", which can be translated as 'witches' or 'sorcerers', as most are men. The history of magical practices here extends back to the pre-Hispanic period and may have survived because of its relative isolation, but Lake Catemaco is said to emit a kind of energy, along with the Mono Blanco Mountain that rises above it.\n\nThese magical practices are an uneasy mix of Catholic rite, especially the invocation of saints and pre-Hispanic beliefs and rituals. Though many tourists are simply amused by the kitschy T-shirts of witches or other souvenirs or attractions, some do take the practice seriously. There are practitioners of both “white” and “black” magic, with the white version being more acceptable. Those who practice the black version charge more.\n\nSorcery is one of the main attractions of Catemaco. The belief in magical practices has attracted people from all walks of life, from waiters and taxi drivers to national-level politicians. Veracruz governor Fidel Herrera Beltrán even pushed for a national school for sorcery in Catemaco, without success and is a regular at the annual event. Visitors usually seek limpias (ritual cleansings), healing or something to give them an edge in business. These magical practices have also migrated out of the Catemaco area as residents move to other places such as Ciudad Juárez to work.\n\nAlthough the sorcery is a main attraction, it is not promoted as part of Halloween or Day of the Dead . The main event for practitioners is the annual Congreso Nacional de Brujos de Catemaco (officially called the Ritos, Ceremonias y Artesanías Mágica because of objections from the Catholic Church) . The main event is the opening, on the first Friday of March. This begins with a “black mass” on the edge of Lake Catemaco by the “brujo mayor” (loosely translated as “high witch or sorcerer”), which attracts up to 5,000 people. The event was founded in the 1970s by former brujo mayor Gonzalo Aguirre and today attracts around 200 shamans, healers (curanderos), herbalists, psychics and fortune tellers. It also brings in as much as three million pesos to the local economy.\n\nThe popularity of the brujos and the event has created problems as well. Many con artists have taken advantage of the situation, making the finding of genuine practitioners difficult. There have been disputes among the practitioners over clients, tourism, and who leads the rites at the annual gathering. There has also been controversy related to those who sacrifice animals or petition Santa Muerte or the Devil.\n\nIn the early pre Hispanic period, the area was dominated by the Olmecs, but the name is derived from Nahuatl, meaning “place of the burned houses.” This name is probably in reference to an eruption of the San Martin Volcano.\n\nFrom the 16th century, the area was part of the province of Santiago Tuxtla, which became a municipality after Independence. The city itself was founded in 1774. In 1881, it officially became a town and in 1966 declared a city.\n\n"}

Sam Yaek District and Chakkrawat District were later merged into Samphanthawong District. The district became Khet Samphanthawong in 1972. It is believed that the name \"Samphanthawong\" was derived from \"Wat Samphanthawongsaram\", the temple near the district office when it was first built. Now the district office has moved to Yotha Road in Talat Noi Sub-district.\n\nThe district is divided into three sub-districts (\"khwaeng\").\nYaowarat Road (เยาวราช) is about 1.5 km in length. Along both sides, gold shops and Chinese restaurants: noodles, rice, dim sum, bird's nest soup are found. More shops, especially those selling fruit and Chinese traditional medicine, can be found in the small lanes branching off the main road. A gate was built to celebrate King Bhumibol's 72nd birthday. It is on Odeon Circle, (named after a cinema that once stood nearby) at end of Yaowarat Road.\n\nSome of well-known Thai Buddhist temples in the district are:\n\nMany Chinese temples and shrines are also here, including:\n\nThe most famous Chinese temple in the area, Wat Mangkon Kamalawat (วัดมังกรกมลาวาส), popularly known as Wat Leng Noei Yi (วัดเล่งเน่ยยี่), lies just outside the Samphanthawong boundary in the neighboring Pom Prap Sattru Phai District.\n\nThere are other places of historic interest in Samphanthawong. Wat Mae Phra Luk Prakham (วัดแม่พระลูกประคำ) or Holy Rosary Church, on the bank of Chao Phraya River, is one of the oldest Catholic churches in Bangkok. It is more widely known by its older name, Wat Kalawar (วัดกาลหว่าร์), named after Calvary. It was first built in 1787 during King Rama I period by settlers who migrated from Ayuthaya when the city was lost to Burma. The current building was constructed in 1890.\n\nUpriver from the church is Thailand's first commercial bank building. The building was constructed in 1904 and houses the Talat Noi Branch of Siam Commercial Bank. Downriver from Holy Rosary Church is River City Shopping Complex, a shopping center specializing in arts and antiques.\n\nThere are numerous markets around Samphanthawong. There are many shops and stalls along Yaowarat, Sampheng (now Wanit 1), and Charoen Krung Roads, especially at night and during weekends. Saphan Lek, the older name of the bridge crossing Khlong Ong Ang canal on Charoen Krung Road, is a narrow strip along both sides of Khlong Ong Ang with small shops selling goods. Nearby is Woeng Nakhon Khasem (เวิ้งนาครเขษม) or \"thieves market\". The Khlong Thom Market (in Pom Prap Sattru Phai District), once a famous market for low cost goods and electronics, is a large area of several blocks on the opposite side of Charoen Krung Road. The small lanes inside the blocks were fully packed with stalls operating on Saturday nights till Sunday mornings, but it is now closed as part of a pavement cleanup campaign in March 2015.\n\nSeveral Chinese festivals are held here yearly. Yaowarat Road is often closed to traffic during these periods.\n\n\n"}

It describes the sensual experiences of a faun who has just woken up from his afternoon sleep and discusses his encounters with several nymphs during the morning in a dreamlike monologue.\n\nIt is Mallarmé's best-known work and a hallmark in the history of symbolism in French literature. Paul Valéry considered it to be the greatest poem in French literature.\n\nInitial versions of the poem, originally titled \"Le Faune, intermède héroique\" were written between 1865 (the first mention of the poem is found in a letter Mallarmé wrote to Henri Cazalis in June 1865) and 1867. Mallarmé submitted the first text to the Théâtre-Français in 1867, only to be rejected. Ten years later, under the title \"Improvisation d’un Faune\" the work was rejected again, this time by publisher Alphonse Lemerre, who had previously published Mallarmé's work in \"Parnasse contemporain\". Mallarmé left Lemerre and found Alphonse Derenne, an editor, publisher, and bookseller of primarily medical books who sought to expand his business. The final text was published in 1876 (see 1876 in poetry) by Derenne under the present title \"L'après-midi d'un faune\". For the publication, Mallarmé's long-time friend, Édouard Manet, created four wood-engraved embellishments which were printed in black, and hand-tinted in pink by Manet himself in order to save money.\n\nMallarmé's poem would provide the inspiration for many musical works, the most prominent of which being \"Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune\" by Claude Debussy. Other composers who drew subject matter and inspiration from Mallarmé’s poetry include Maurice Ravel in \"Trois poèmes de Mallarmé\" (1913), Darius Milhaud with \"Chansons bas de Stéphane Mallarmé\" (1917), and Pierre Boulez, with his hour-long solo soprano and orchestra piece \"Pli selon pli\" (1957–62). The poem also served basis for the ballets \"Afternoon of a Faun\" by Vaslav Nijinsky (1912), Jerome Robbins (1953) and Tim Rushton (2006). Debussy's orchestral work and Nijinsky's ballet would be of great significance in the development of modernism in the arts.\n\n\n\n"}

The station was on the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, originally a broad gauge line overseen by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, but later taken over by the Midland Railway and converted to standard gauge.\n\nCharfield station opened with the Bristol and Gloucester line in 1844 and had substantial Brunel-designed buildings on both platforms. There were sidings to the north and south, and those to the north were converted to loops to allow slow trains to be overtaken by faster trains.\n\nIn 1928, the Charfield railway disaster occurred when a southbound night-time mail train overran signals into a goods train manoeuvring into these sidings, and in the collision the mail train was diverted into the path of a northbound freight train. Gas from the mail train ignited and 15 people died in the blaze. According to some accounts, among them were two children whose identity was never established.\n\nPassenger services were withdrawn from Charfield in January 1965 with the removal of stopping services on the Bristol to Gloucester line. Goods services were withdrawn in September of the same year. The main station building and the station master's house remain, in residential use.\n\nServices between Bristol and Birmingham pass through Charfield. There have been discussions about the viability of reopening the station. The costs would be shared between Gloucestershire and South Gloucestershire councils since, although the station would be in South Gloucestershire, the nearby town of Wotton-under-Edge would be a principal beneficiary.\n\nIn February 2019, the West of England Combined Authority announced a £500,000 feasibility study into plans for two new bypasses and work to see whether Charfield is viable for reopening to passengers. In June 2019, a further £900,000 was allocated for the production of a full business case for the reopening of the station.\n\nThe January 2020 version of the Joint Local Transport Plan 4 (JLTP4, led by the West of England Combined Authority) proposed to deliver by 2023–2024 a \"New station at Charfield funded through the WECA Investment Fund, to support housing growth\".\n"}
{"id": "2247155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2247155", "title": "Verbier", "text": "Verbier\n\nVerbier is a village located in south-western Switzerland in the canton of Valais. It is a holiday resort and ski area in the Swiss Alps and is recognised as one of the premier backcountry ski resorts in the world. Some areas are covered with snow all year. Skiers have settled in the Verbier area in order to take advantage of the steep slopes, varied conditions, and resort culture.\n\nVerbier is located in the municipality of Bagnes, in the Swiss canton of Valais. The village lies on a south oriented terrace at around 1,500 metres facing the Grand Combin massif. The terrace lies on the east side of the Val de Bagnes, a valley located south of Martigny.\n\nVerbier had 2767 permanent residents in 2006. The number of residents can rise to 35,000 in the winter season. There is a noticeable population of Scandinavian and British residents.\n\nThe town has a public school system for its residents up until high school level, when locals must travel down into the valley for schooling. In September 2010, the Verbier campus of St. George's (now called Lemania-Verbier International School), a private international school, was founded and opened its doors in the Chalet Mascotte at the entrance of the village.\n\nVerbier has been an Alpine resort with guests from Britain, Germany and other European countries since the early 20th Century. During World War I the local economy suffered from a lack of tourist revenue as people were unable or unwilling to travel to Switzerland from countries at war. From 1916-1918 Verbier, along with other Alpine resorts, housed interned German, French and British soldiers who required medical treatment.\n\nThere is a vibrant community of photographers and artists in Verbier, most born out of winter sports action photography.\n\nVerbier can be accessed by road or by train. From Martigny a regional train (known as the \"Saint-Bernard Express\") leads to Le Châble. From Le Châble a cable car (or a post bus) goes up to Verbier. Martigny is a 1 hour 45 minute journey from Geneva and a 20 min journey from Sion, travelling with Swiss Federal Railways.\n\nVerbier has only one access road, which starts in the town of Le Châble. From Sembrancher (near Le Châble) a road leads to the Great St. Bernard Pass and another to Martigny or to the Col de la Forclaz. Verbier is around 2 hours' drive from Geneva, 1 hour from Chamonix (Col de la Forclaz) and 1 hour from Aosta (Great St. Bernard Pass).\n\nThe nearest international airport is Geneva Airport. Minibus transfers are available from the airport to Verbier center during the winter ski season.\n\nThe town itself is small enough to be explored on foot, but free buses run throughout the resort regularly during the day.\n\nVerbier’s ski domain ranges from 1500 m (Verbier Village) up to 3330 m (Mont Fort) from which there is a panoramic view of the Alps encompassing the Matterhorn Cervin, Dom, Dent Blanche, Dent d'Hérens, Grand Combin and Mont Blanc massif. It is part of the \"Four Valleys\" (\"4 Vallées\") ski area, which includes the ski resorts of Verbier, Nendaz, Veysonnaz, La Tzoumaz, and Thyon with a claimed total of 410 km marked runs. However, an independent expert measured that the real extent of marked runs is 164 km rather than 410 km.\n\nThe ski area is divided into four sectors: Medran, Les Savoleyres, Mont Fort and Bruson. Verbier forms the western section of the 4 Valleys ski area. A 4 Valley pass allows a tour all the way from Verbier to La Tzoumaz, Nendaz, Veysonnaz, Les Masses, Thyon and back.\n\nThe Verbier section of the 4 Valleys ski area has recent lifts made by Leitner, CWA, Poma and Garaventa AG; all operated by Téléverbier SA. In Verbier alone, there are 35 lifts (within the Verbier, Savoleyeres/La Tzoumaz and Bruson sector). A standard Verbier pass gives access to this entire sector, 33 standard ski runs, two snowparks, one \"Jardin de Neige\" (a relatively flat area that is used for small children learning to ski), four cross-country pistes and two walking areas.\n\nVerbier is known for its off-piste and itinerary runs. Amongst these are popular mogul fields Tortin, Gentianes, Mont Fort and Plan du Fou as well as more advanced itineraries Vallon D'Arbi and Mont Gelé (which are often closed). Notable off-piste runs are the Backside of Mont Fort, Bec des Etagnes, Stairway to Heaven, Highway, Marlenaz, Croix de Coeur, Bacombe, Col des Mines, Creblets, Couloir de la Banane, Col de la Mouche, The Rocky Garden, The Hidden Valley (down to Auddes-sur-Riddes), Couloir des Dix, Col de la Banane, and the less accessible Bec des Rosses, annual host for the finals of the Freeride World Tour. Off-pistes skiing can be dangerous, and sometimes lethal, due to the risk of avalanches, hidden obstacles, crevices, extremely steep runs, and other hazards. In the 2012-13 season, a skier was killed by an avalanche on the Col de la Mouche and two others died at the Bec des Etagnes. \nVerbier is one of only a few resorts to contain a mountain with no pistes coming down it (Mont Gelé). On rare occasions, it is also possible to ski 700 vertical metres from Verbier Village (1500 m) to Le Châble (800 m) in the valley below, though such a run now entails going through terrain with felled trees and other obstacles. The off-piste run from Col des Gentiannes (2,950 m) down to Le Chable is a better option, but it is important to check that snow conditions are good and that there is no avalanche risk. Also, some of the trails from Col des Gentiannes to Le Châble lead to dead-ends and dangerous rockfaces, so it is essential to be familiar with the terrain before attempting to ski down to Le Châble from Gentiannes.\n\nThe nearest heli-ski landing spots are Rosablanche, Petit Combin, and Trient Glacier.\n\nVerbier is a stop on the most commonly taken route by skiers of the Haute Route, from Chamonix to Zermatt.\n\nVarious ski and snowboard schools propose private lessons, group lessons, clinics, and performance coaching. Mountain guides companies and a few independent mountain guides complete the offer. Ski and snowboard schools include Performance Verbier, Alpinemojo Ski and Snowboard School, La Fantastique, Altitude Ski and Snowboard School, New Generation Ski School, European Snowsport and the Swiss Ski School.\n\nIn 1983, 2 T-bar lifts were installed on the glacier to allow skiing all year. The lifts took 7 minutes and 30 seconds to ride and had a rate of 2,400 people per hour. The summer skiing last operated during July 1999.\n\nIn April 2012, the website SeeVerbier.com published a report as part of an April fools joke claiming that the resort would re-open for summer skiing during June.\n\nAs a result of exceptional weather conditions, Verbier was able to offering skiing on 13 and 14 July 2013. 1,630 people attended the event.\n\nIn the summertime, there are 400 km of hiking trails and hikers can follow the tracks of the chamois and ibex through the mountains, some of them covered with snow all year round. There are 200 km of mountain bike piste. Other activities include climbing, paragliding, swimming, golf, badminton, Ice karting, trips aboard the mountain railways in the area, and an annual music festival.\n\nThe International classical music festival combines every summer seventeen days of musical performances at the invitation of founder .\n\nVerbier is also a popular holiday destination for celebrities and royalty, including The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Sarah, Duchess of York (who owns a Chalet there) and her daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, James Blunt, Diana Ross, Lawrence Dallaglio, Richard Branson, Charles Bromley, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, and the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Denmark. The Swedish Royal Family and the Belgian Royal Family also come here. It caters to British customers, but also receives many visitors from Germany, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, France, Austria, the United States of America and South Africa.\n\nRecurring events in Verbier include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2247157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2247157", "title": "Charfield railway disaster", "text": "Charfield railway disaster\n\nThe Charfield railway disaster was a fatal train crash which occurred on 13 October 1928 in the village of Charfield in the English county of Gloucestershire. The Leeds to Bristol London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) night mail train failed to stop at the signals protecting the down refuge siding at Charfield railway station. The weather was misty, but there was not a sufficiently thick fog for the signalman at Charfield to employ fog signalmen. A freight train was in the process of being shunted from the down main line to the siding, and another train of empty goods wagons was passing through the station from the Bristol (up) direction. \n\nThe mail train collided with the freight train and was derailed, coming into collision with the up train underneath the road bridge to the north of the station. Gas used to light the carriages ignited, and four carriages were burnt out. The driver of the mail train claimed that he had seen a clear distant signal on approach to the station, and therefore had assumed that the home signals protecting the station were also clear; however, testing of the signals after the accident confirmed that the distant had been correctly in the yellow \"caution\" position. The driver was charged with manslaughter, but was subsequently acquitted.\n\nThe 10:00 pm LMS down passenger and mail express from Leeds to Bristol consisted of Midland Railway Class 3 4-4-0 No. 714 steam locomotive hauling a 6-wheel tender, a 6-wheeled parcels van, a goods van, a composite passenger coach, two third-class coaches, another composite coach, a TPO sorting van, a TPO tender, a pair of TPO vans and a passenger brake van. Of these cars, the parcels van, front composite, both 3rd class Coaches and all four TPO vehicles' lighting was powered by flammable gases. In total, the train was carrying 23 gas canisters in these carriages. Only the front goods van had been constructed with electrical lighting, whilst the rear composite and brake van were built to use gas lighting, but had been converted. All eleven carriages were wooden and old at the time of the crash, with the newest coach being the goods van which was built in 1915, the oldest vehicles were the TPO vans which dated back to 1885.\n\nAll but the two front vans on the train had vacuum brakes which could be activated from the locomotive. The locomotive also carried a steam brake to brake itself and its tender. Both brakes were able to be activated from the footplate of the engine, and the vacuum brakes could be activated from the guard's van. In the locomotive was driver E.H Aldington and fireman F.C Want whilst in the Brake Van. at the rear of the train was guard Miller. All three men knew each other well and were experienced. Aldington had worked on the railways since 1891, had been driving goods trains since 1916 and passenger trains since 1924. His last working day prior to the crash was 12 October, where he had driven the 1:45 am mail train from Birmingham to Bristol and then the 7:40 am Birmingham to Bristol mail train. Aldington had considerable experience running on this line, having been scheduled to work it every five days for eleven weeks. Fireman F.C Want had worked on the railways since 1917 with nine and three quarters of a year as a fireman and had known Aldington since December 1926. Unlike Aldington, Want was much less experienced on the route, having only handled it 30 times before. Guard Miller had worked on the railways since 1921.\n\nThe 9:15 pm Great Western Railway (GWR) down semi-fitted goods train from Oxley bound for Bristol. This train consisted of GWR 4300 Class 2-6-0 Locomotive No. 6381, a 6-wheeled tender, forty-nine loaded wagons and a brake van. The locomotive, tender and the front fifteen wagons had vacuum brakes to be operated from the engine, but the remaining 34 wagons were braked via the brake van. The crew aboard this train consisted of driver Gilbert and fireman H. Sutton in the engine and guard W. Fortune in the brake van.\n\nThe 4:45 am LMS up empty goods train from Westerleigh to Gloucester consisted of a 0-6-0 locomotive hauling its tender, forty-five empty wagons and a brake van. The crew aboard this train consisted of driver G. Honeyfield and fireman A. Clarke in the engine and guard Callaway.\n\nAlthough not in the crash itself, two more trains were involved in the lead-up to the disaster, these being the 12:45 am down parcels train from Leicester to Bristol and the 10:35 pm down goods train from Washwood Heath to Bristol, both operated by the LMS.\n\nApproaching Charfield at high speed, Aldington told Want to look out for the down distant signal, even though Want wasn't as experienced on this line as he was, and the fog and lack of knowledge meant he was unsure as to the signal's location. However, 60 yards from the down distant, Want claimed to see the green signal and said to Aldington \"He's got it off mate!\" before shovelling in some more coal to the engine. As he returned the shovel to the tender, Aldington saw the GWR goods engine emerge from the fog. Realizing a collision was about to occur, he quickly applied the brakes before ducking down.\n\nThe mail train crashed into the GWR goods train, the engine of the LMS train clipping the edges of the two front-most goods vans of the GWR Train before crashing into the tender, which at that point was slightly askew of the main line as it was being shunted clear. The LMS engine crashed into the right-hand side of the GWR tender and derailed to the right, ploughing into two empty wagons of the up LMS train before it overturned onto its right side against the up slope near the bridge. The GWR tender was flung onto its left side against the north side of the bridge, while the GWR engine became wedged against the abutment, causing the first six vehicles (the parcel van, the other van, the front composite, the two 3rd class carriages and the rear composite) to become wedged under the bridge.\n\nWhilst the engine of the mail train was derailed and tossed clear, the tender was derailed but remained on the track. The sudden deceleration caused the two vans, the front composite coach and first 3rd class coach to violently telescope. The rear 3rd class coach hit the rear of the front coach, forcing the front of the carriage to become entangled with the coach ahead of it, causing both underframes to bend upwards until it came to rest leaning on the north side of the bridge. Part of the roof was torn off and thrown onto the bridge. The rear composite and the cars behind it came to an abrupt halt, but remained on the rails, each receiving varying amounts of damage.\n\nThe GWR goods train's first two wagons which were still being shunted clear when the LMS train hit received glancing blows whilst the tender of the train received the brunt of the impact. Both 6381's tender and engine were pinned against the wall by the mail train's carriages. The remaining forty-seven wagons mostly received either minor damage or were undamaged. Fortune's brake van was completely undamaged and the forty-seven wagons were able to be taken aback.\n\nThe Westerleigh goods train was still passing under the bridge at the time of the collision. The engine and eight Wagons were clear of the site when the collision occurred. The locomotive and front 6 wagons were undamaged, but the seventh and eighth were derailed, although they remained attached to the locomotive and upright, being dragged down the line until Honeyfield and Clarke realized what had occurred. The ninth wagon was derailed by the LMS mail locomotive, skidding into the down cutting by the bridge just ahead of the locomotive. The tenth wagon was hurled by the engine off the rails and collided with the down cutting of the bridge, coming to a halt close to the GWR Engine. The eleventh wagon followed the tenth, clipping the mail train's tender which stopped it. The twelfth wagon came loose from the eleventh after colliding with it and being pushed so it was facing opposite to the rails. The thirteenth wagon was derailed and collided with the rear of the twelfth wagon. The fourteenth wagon had been pushed by the LMS mail locomotive's momentum off the Rails, facing parallel to the down Line with minor damage. The fifteenth wagon had clipped the rear right-side of the fourteenth wagon and had derailed to the right of it. The sixteenth wagon was derailed at the front left side and the rear right side. The seventeenth wagon's coupling to the sixteenth broke in the collision and was slightly derailed. The eighteenth wagon had similarly been slightly derailed but was undamaged. The remaining 29 wagons and Callaway's van were undamaged and remained on the rails.\n\nAs Aldington had applied the brakes of the train and ducked, when the locomotive derailed, he was mostly uninjured, although he was buried in coal for ten minutes before he was pulled clear of it. Want similarly was mostly uninjured although he too was buried in coal, but was able to climb out of it unlike Aldington. Even though his brake van was undamaged and remained on the rails, the sudden stop flung Miller from his chair, dislocating his shoulder.\n\nBefore Button ordered him to shunt clear, Gilbert saw the Charfield down distant turn to red after his engine passed by it. In the collision, Gilbert and Sutton were both thrown amongst the coals and were injured, Sutton receiving minor injuries whilst Gilbert was more seriously injured. In preparation for the shunting activity, Fortune had dismounted his van at Charfield Station and when the train began to shunt, he walked with the train along the platform before following it beside the tracks and was guiding Sutton and Gilbert (Sutton later claimed that he was unable to see anything outside of the engine due to the thick fog) into the siding when the collision occurred. He was uninjured as he had been standing well behind the GWR Locomotive.\n\nDriver Honeyfield and Clarke of the Westerleigh goods train meanwhile had passed under the Bridge at about 20 mph when he felt a tugging sensation on the train. Both men thought that it was nothing serious and continued before stopping the train at the up advance signal which was set to danger by Button after the Collision. Looking back, they realized what had happened to his train. Guard Callaway of the Westerleigh goods train was slightly injured in the sudden stop of his train, but otherwise fine.\n\nIn the aftermath of the collision, as in earlier railway crashes at Quintinshill, Hawes Junction and Thirsk, a fire broke out. It is believed that the gas cylinders of the first four cars were punctured and a cloud of gas quickly formed under the bridge and a fire broke out. Although many likely perished in the collision, it seems likely that the majority of the 14 passenger fatalities were due to the fire.\n\nSeven of the 11 cars of the mail train (the two vans, the brake van, both composites and both 3rd class coaches) were completely destroyed by the fire. In a combination of the fire and the collision, the ninth to seventeenth wagons were completely destroyed. Two of the GWR goods train's wagons (the two the mail train clipped) were both completely destroyed.\n\nIntense fire made identification of the dead and even a complete body count difficult, but it is believed that 15 people died and a further 23 were injured. (The official report lists 16 deaths and 41 injuries). Among the dead were stated to be the remains of two small children, who have never been identified. According to local accounts, from 1929 until the late 1950s, an unknown woman dressed in black used to regularly visit the memorial to the crash. But she has not been seen for several decades. There is a memorial to remember those who lost their lives at St James Church in Charfield, where the two unknown children are buried.\n\nArchie Ayres was the local carpenter in 1928 and was regularly employed by the local undertakers, Goscombes, to make coffins. He made the coffins for the fifteen people killed in the train crash. According to his daughter, Mrs Smith (née Ayres) in 1999, he made thirteen coffins plus two small boxes. The latter contained the remains that could not be associated with particular individuals. J.A.B. Hamilton had visited him and obtained the same information while researching for his 1968 book According to L T C Rolt (who also perpetuates the story of two children) in \"Red for Danger\", the crash blazed for twelve hours. Mrs Smith described how some years after the crash, a reporter from a well-known Sunday newspaper came to interview her father. Once her father had explained the \"mystery\", the reporter was no longer interested and got up and walked out.\n\nSeconds after the collision, Button informed the company control office at Fishponds of the accident and requested ambulances, maintenance staff, cranes and other assistance to be sent from Bristol and Gloucester. Guard Callaway of the Westerleigh goods train meanwhile informed the Charfield stationmaster of the crash, the stationmaster arriving at 5:38 am, only eight minutes after Callaway had called him. Having established that Button had informed Booking and Smith of the obstruction, the stationmaster quickly informed the heads of LMS before making a human chain of rescuers to haul buckets of water to the fire whilst allowing people to take axes to cut their way into the wrecked train. The first doctors from Wotton-under-Edge arrived at 6:20 am whilst a special train carrying doctors arrived from Bristol at 7:17 am.\n\nAfter extracting themselves from the coal, both Aldington and Want made their way to Button's signalbox and said \"What is the meaning of this? Your distant was off!\" but Button replied that such a thing was impossible. Button was correct, as he could not have 'pulled off' any down signal, and while the down distant showed clear via the repeater, this was found to be due to debris on the actuating cables and the weight of the debris was not enough to lower the blue lens (semaphore signals were lit with paraffin oil lamps at the time, which gave a distinctly yellowish flame - a blue lens covering the lamp would result in a green light being shown) to show the green light Want claimed to have seen.\n\nWhen Want and Aldington were sent to trial for manslaughter, neither attempted to excuse themselves because of the poor weather or lack of fogmen, but rather put emphasis on the fact that the distant signal was at clear. Aldington said when the mail train was approaching Charfield, he was standing behind Want who was keeping his eyes out for signals which both saw as green. Because of this, Aldington assumed the station was clear of traffic and could proceed through to Wickwar. However, error by Button was ruled out in the investigation, since Button's signals would not be able to change the down distant due to the GWR Train occupying the section. The only possibilities were that Aldington and Want did not see the down distant, or that they saw the signal, which had been somehow set to green. The only way the latter could occur was if something heavy weighed down the cables, or if they had been sabotaged. However, no traces of either were found and the mystery remains to this day.\n\nEarly in the morning of 13 October, three down trains (The LMS parcels, mail and goods train and the GWR goods train) were expected to pass through Charfield.\n\nThe two goods trains were proceeding much slower than the parcels train. To prevent delays to the more important parcels train, signalman H. Button of Charfield Box and R.H Smith of Berkeley Road Junction (the block post before Charfield) agreed to shunt the two goods trains clear. Button shunted the LMS Goods Train into a siding at Charfield whilst Smith shunted the GWR Goods Train into a siding at Berkeley Road Junction. The parcels train quickly raced through the Stations. After signalman F.W Booking of Wickwar (the signalbox after Charfield) signalled \"out of section\" to Button, he signalled for the LMS goods train to depart the sidings. However, the driver of this train chose to spend five minutes taking on water at Charfield, something he wasn't booked to do. Nor did he inform Button of this. As a result, the original plan for the GWR goods train had to be altered. The mail train meanwhile was fast approaching Charfield and with this in mind, Button was forced to shunt the GWR goods train into the sidings in Charfield once the LMS goods train had left.\n\nThe block telegraph instruments at Charfield had three different positions: train on line, line clear and line blocked. Not only was it in control of the station and sidings, the signal box was a block post for two sections: Berkeley Road to Charfield (up line) and Charfield to Wickwar (down line), and was in control of signals for the entrance to the station and the following block sections on each line. (This was standard block working – even though the box may control a section it controlled the signals for the entrance to next section along the line.) The down line signals protected trains in both the down line of the station and Charfield to Wickwar section of the down line which followed. It was on the down line that events would occur. The block instrument could not be set to line clear until the train on the line had passed over a treadle at the next signal box and the signalman in the box had sent his consent by telegraph. The Block instruments were interlocked with the signal levers so that unless the respective instrument stood at 'line clear', they could not be cleared to accept a train. This prevented any false signals being given by mistake.\n\nWhen the GWR goods passed Button's 'clearing point' signal (the end of the section) at 5:13 am, it released the treadle and thus allowed the section from Berkeley road to Charfield to be cleared. He then shouted to Gilbert and Sutton of the goods train to shunt and 'pulled off' his shunting disc signal. At this time, nothing was out of the ordinary. It was less than an hour before dawn, and the railway tracks were shrouded with fog. Due to the fog, Button could not see his down distant signal or his down outer home signal (both were connected to electrical repeaters which showed the signal position via an instrument in his box), but he could see his 'fog object' and therefore saw no need to call out fogmen. The section from Berkeley Road to Charfield was clear, and therefore Button could accept the LMS night mail from Smith. He was perfectly justified in doing so, given that had a quarter of a mile clear between the clearing point signal and his outer home signal (the first \"stop\" signal controlled by Charfield box)- there was plenty of space for the mail to stop. The station, however, was occupied by the shunting goods train and therefore his signals stood at danger. He accepted the mail at 5:14 am.\n\nThe signals at Charfield should have been at danger, since the block system employed left no room for human error on the signalman's part. The outer home signal (which was at danger) at Charfield, was fitted with a track circuit. The GWR goods train was nearly clear of the line and the Westerleigh empty up goods train was approaching from Wickwar, when Button happened to notice the indicator for this track circuit. It changed to 'occupied', but then Button then saw to his alarm the indicator fly back to 'clear' again. This could mean only one thing: the mail had failed to stop at the signal. Having not heeded the distant signal which should have been at caution, Aldington and Want of the mail had assumed the line to be clear and had passed the home signal at around sixty miles an hour. To make matters worse Button had accepted the up goods train, which was approaching the road bridge. There was no error in Button's part in doing this, but it meant that the mail was running into a bottleneck – the track was in a cutting with a road bridge spanning both main lines, the sidings cutting off at the road bridge. Both main lines were blocked.\n\nThe report on the accident by Colonel Pringle stated that the LMS conversion from gas to electric lighting was not going as fast as the Board of Trade (HMRI) had hoped, and had the rolling stock of the train been electrically lit, the effects of the collision would have been greatly mitigated. It also recommended the installation of the GWR invention of automatic train control, a system which worked by having an insulated steel bar laid centrally between the rails at all distant signals. When a train passed over it, the bar made contact with a spring-loaded shoe and so raised it. When the lever in the signal box was at 'clear', the bar was electrified and when a train passed over it a bell was sounded in the cab because the current passed through the shoe. However, when the lever was at 'caution', the shoe remained dead and when it was raised it broke an electrical circuit in the locomotive, sounding an alarm whistle in the cab and opening an air valve on the brake pipes, thus clearing the vacuum and applying the automatic vacuum brakes. This alone could have prevented the disaster.\n\nIt was undoubtedly clear that the disaster was caused due to Want and Aldington Overrunning the Signal but LMS management shared some responsibility for not quickening the pace of the conversion of lighting in trains (which the Ministry Of Transport declared must occur after the train crash at Ais Gill in 1913 and that the driver of the LMS goods train from Washwood Heath also shared a minor role in the accident, as he had chosen to take water in Charfield after being shunted there to allow the parcels train through, without telling Button. Had he chosen to take water at the scheduled point, then the GWR goods train would not be delayed and be forced to shunt again for the mail train at Charfield.\n\n"}

Its primary purpose is to push up the bust by tightening against the upper midriff and forcing the breasts up while gently shaping the waist. Nowadays, it might also be worn as a push-up bra under a low-backed dress or as a camisole for outerwear. The bustier can also be worn as a half-slip under sheer upper garments if a bold display of the midriff is not desired.\n\nA bustier resembles a basque, but it is shorter. It reaches down only to the ribs or waist.\n\nModern bustiers are often made with mesh panels rather than the traditional boning.\n\nThese delicate garments were representative and a symbol of nobility for women with power since 2000 BC. At the beginning these were not used as underwear, much less, they were a complete, 1-piece garment, like a dress, but in the 16th century, specifically in Italy, their design varied until they had the representative style that we can appreciate today. \n\n"}
