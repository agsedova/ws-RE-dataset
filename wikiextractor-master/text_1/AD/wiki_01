As the Telugu film industry was based in Madras at the time, he spent his entire childhood in Madras. During his adolescence, he moved to Hyderabad following the shifting of the Telugu film industry to that city. He earned a bachelor's degree in commerce from Nizam College, Hyderabad, Telangana. In 1982, at the age of 22, Balakrishna married Vasundhara Devi, and they have three children.\n\nIn 1974, Balakrishna acted as a child artist in \"Tatamma Kala\", which was directed by N. T.

In 1986, he acted in movies such as \"Muddula Krishnaiah\", \"Seetharama Kalyanam\", \"Anasuyamma Gari Alludu\" and \"Deshoddharakudu\", which gradually increased his potential at the box office.\n\nIn 1987, Balakrishna acted in a dual role in the film \"Apoorva Sahodarulu\", directed by K. Raghavendra Rao. In the same year, he starred in \"President Gari Abbai\", directed by Tatineni Rama Rao and \"Muvva Gopaludu\", by Kodi Ramakrishna. His other films like \"Inspector Pratap\", \"Bharatamlo Bala Chandrudu\", \"Tiragabadda Telugubidda\", \"Raktabhishekam\" were also successful at the box office. In 1989, he paired with Vijayashanti in \"Muddula Mavayya\" directed by Kodi Ramakrishna. In 1990, he acted in \"Nari Nari Naduma Murari\", directed by A. Kodandarami Reddy, alongside Shobana and Nirosha. In the same year, he appeared in B. Gopal's \"Lorry Driver\", opposite Vijayashanti.\n\nIn 1991, Balakrishna acted in science fiction film \"Aditya 369\", directed by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao. This was the only science fiction film in Telugu cinema during that period of time. He then had two releases in 1992, \"Dharma Kshetram\" with Divya Bharathi and \"Rowdy Inspector\", directed by B. Gopal. In 1993, he had two releases on the same day, which are \"Nippu Ravva\", alongside Shobana and Vijayashanti, directed by A.

In the year 1999, he acted in B. Gopal's action film \"Samarasimha Reddy\", opposite Simran and Anjala Zhaveri.\n\nIn 2000, Balakrishna acted in \"Goppinti Alludu\", directed by E V V Satyanarayana with Simran. In 2001, he starred in the B. Gopal-directed faction film \"Narasimha Naidu\", opposite Simran once again. The film became the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time until the record was broken by Chiranjeevi's \"Indra\", which was also directed by B. Gopal. Balakrishna won his first Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance. In the same year, he appeared in \"Bhalevadivi Basu\" with Shilpa Shetty and Anjala Zhaveri. His 2002 and 2003 films include \"Seema Simham\" and \"Chennakeshava Reddy\". The former received unfavourable reviews and was a box office flop, but the latter one was critically and financially successful. In 2004, he performed in a remake of the 2003 Tamil film \"Saamy\", titled \"Lakshmi Narasimha\", with Asin Thottumkal. The film and Balakrishna's performance won critical acclaim and was a financial success. During the period, he also announced plans to act and direct in the remake of \"Nartanasala\", and a launch event was held in Hyderabad in March 2003. Produced by Pusapati Lakshmipati Raju, the film was announced to have an ensemble cast also featuring Soundarya, Srihari, Saikumar, Uday Kiran and Asin in lead roles. However, despite a grand launch, the film was later shelved following the sudden demise of Soundarya.\n\nThe years from 2005 to 2009 saw action-drama flicks such as \"Vijayendra Varma\", \"Veerabhadra\", \"Allari Pidugu\", \"Okka Magadu\" and \"Maharadhi\" which did not perform well at the box office. He paired with Sneha and Tabu in the mythological movie \"Panduranga\" (2008), directed by K. Raghavendra Rao. He played the dual roles of Krishna and Panduranga. Rediff described his performance as \"Balakrishna does justice to both the roles of God and Ranga. He shines in the climax of the movie. It's quite a task to step into NTR's shoes, but his son has done pretty well, though one does miss NTR in the role of Krishna!\". The film was an average success and his performance won him the Santosham Best Actor Award. In the year 2009, he starred in the family drama \"Mithrudu\", alongside Priyamani in a slightly different role – that of a dependable friend and confidante to the female lead. The film opened to average reviews.\n\nIn 2010, Balakrishna acted in Boyapati Srinu's film \"Simha\", alongside Nayantara and Sneha Ullal. He played a dual role as father and son. The film opened to positive reviews, and went on to become the highest-grossing Telugu film of the year. A review in Rediff said about his performance: \"Balakrishna has put in a restrained performance. Though his character is supposed to roar at times, he seems subdued most of the time. But he's given plenty to be pleased about as it is his show all the way.\" In 2011, he acted in the mythological film \"Sri Rama Rajyam\", based on the epic Ramayana. He played a triple role in the 2012 action drama \"Adhinayakudu\" as grandfather, father and grandson. In 2014, he acted in Boyapati Srinu's film \"Legend\", alongside Sonal Chauhan and Jagapati Babu. He played the title role in the biographical and historical film \"Gautamiputra Satakarni\", his 100th film. The film is directed by Krish and is based on the life of the 2nd century ruler of the Satavahana Empire, Gautamiputra Satakarni. In 2018, he acted in \"Jai Simha\", which was directed by K. S. Ravikumar and started shooting for the \"N.T.R.\" biopic in which he reprised the role of NTR. The film was made in two parts, and the was released on 9 January 2019, with the on 22 February 2019.\n\nSince the founding of the Telugu Desam Party, Balakrishna campaigned for it in every election, but didn't enter the electoral battle until 2014. During a vacation to his father-in-law's house, he went on a political campaign for TDP all over East Godavari district. He ran in the 2014 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections on behalf of TDP and won the Hindupur Assembly Constituency seat with a reasonable majority. Hindupur, in Anantapur district, has been a TDP stronghold since 1983. It was once represented by NTR himself and later for a term by his elder son Nandamuri Harikrishna and Balakrishna will be the third from the family to represent it in the State Assembly.\n\nIn 2012 the Governor of Goa, B.V. Wanchoo, the Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar and Balakrishna were seen along with award winners and other dignitaries at the closing ceremony of the 43rd edition of the IFFI. Balakrishna, in his speech, said that although the Telugu film industry finds no place in the film festival by way of representation its films, 80 percent of the movies that are produced in India are in regional languages, out of which 50 percent are from South India. \"Today, film industry is facing competition from radio, and television as also from piracy,\" he stated. He also maintained that the film festivals have enlarged his vision towards his career.\n\nBalakrishna was involved in a shooting controversy which took place on 3 June 2004 around 8:50 PM at Balakrishna's residence in Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad. Balakrishna allegedly fired shots at producer B. Suresh and his associate, Satyanarayana Chowdhary. Later, both the wounded were admitted into Apollo hospital. The circumstances under which the case was handled led to controversy as purported by the Human Right Forum (HRF). The HRF questioned the authenticity of people who handled the case, and the circumstances under which Balakrishna was shielded from police by being given refuge in Care Hospital without any justifiable cause.\n\nThe two victims gave statements before the magistrate, alleging that Balakrishna fired shots at them, but later retracted their earlier statements. Balakrishna was later arrested on 6 June and produced before Fifth Metropolitan Magistrate. A show cause notice was also served on Balakrishna's wife Vasundhara Devi as the weapon used was licensed under her name, and she could not give sufficient protection to her weapon. Later, Balakrishna was granted bail on conditions that he should not leave Hyderabad without Court's permission and to surrender his passport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the tenth verse of the Sermon on the Mount. This verse is generally seen as part of an expansion of the eight Beatitude, others see it as the second half of the ninth Beatitude, a small group feel it is the tenth Beatitude and thus brings to a close a second Decalogue.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 5:12\n\nFrance notes that the word glad in the original is actually a more complex term meaning \"joy in the face of persecution and martyrdom\" that has no easy translation in English.\n\nSome have been concerned about how closely this verse links good behaviour to eternal rewards, and that it implies that concern about these rewards is the main consideration in being moral. Albright and Mann notes that the idea of rewards and punishments has \"undeniable prominence\" in the Gospel of Matthew. Hill feels that reward can be read as simply \"good repute,\" the opposite of the slander in the previous verse. Albright and Mann note that heaven is not here referring to the modern idea of a place that one goes after death which only developed later, rather it refers simply to \"being with God.\"\n\nSchweizer notes that some have read prophets as meaning that this verse, and perhaps that which went before it, was only directed at the elite group of Christ's disciples and not the general population. Schweizer feels that it actually has just the opposite meaning and is instead showing that the promises in and that all would someday be equal to the prophets had come to pass. Hill notes that the Essenes called each other prophets, and that Jesus might have here adopted that usage.\n"}

The title is a reference to the long running BBC TV show \"Grange Hill\" about a school of that name. Both strips were set in horrifying schools.\n\nThe \"Dandy\" version was a very \"safe\" version of Hammer Horror clichés, similar to Number 13 in \"The Beano\" or the US TV series \"The Munsters\". Drawn by David Mostyn. The focus was on the school's only normal pupil, who was remarkably unfazed that his schoolmates included a vampire, a mummy, etc. The full title was \"Eddie Potter at Strange Hill School\". (This is not a parody of Harry Potter, who did not exist yet.) It appeared in Dandy from 1986 to circa 2004. He reappeared for a few issues in 2008, as reprints. He also appeared in the 2012 annual.\n\nBy contrast, the \"Whizzer and Chips\" version featured a normal teacher, at a similar, but much more grotesque school. Unlike the lead character in the DC Thomson strip, \"Teach\" found his sanity rapidly decaying as he faced his horrific pupils.\n\nIt could be argued that the difference between these strips highlight the differences between the relatively safe, conservative humour of DC Thomson and the more edgy, bizarre Fleetway style.\n\n"}

The Cultus Crescent was sold as such in Japan until May 1998, when it was renamed Suzuki Cultus due to the sales discontinuation of the previous Cultus in the Japanese market. The Cultus Crescent was also marketed as the Suzuki Esteem in North America, and as the throughout Asia, Australasia, Europe, South America, and Puerto Rico. In India where it was manufactured by Maruti Suzuki, the Cultus Crescent was sold as the Maruti Baleno. In the Philippines, it was marketed as the Chevrolet Cassia.\n\nThe Cultus Crescent was introduced in Japan in January 1995 and then to the global market in the first half of 1995. It was Suzuki's first attempt in the competitive compact segment. As a North American replacement for the Suzuki Cultus (Swift) sedan (the three-door hatchback remained after it was redesigned in 1995), it was built on a slightly stretched Cultus platform for improved cabin room, but otherwise sharing most of internal components with the smaller model—and marketed as a distinct model.\n\nThe Cultus Crescent was initially available as a three-door hatchback and four-door sedan, with the SOHC 16-valve G-family engine, in 1.3- and 1.5-liter form, with power ranging from . The 1.3-liter was only offered in the hatch while a 1.6-liter with was only fitted to the sedan. Eventually, 4WD was offered with the 1.6-liter variant, basically the same engine as found in the Suzuki Escudo, with power raised to . A sports variant, dubbed GT, used Mazda's 1,840 cc BP engine, with . It was introduced in the spring of 1996, at the same time that the lineup was extended with the Baleno/Esteem Wagon (Maruti Baleno Altura in India). This was Suzuki's first station wagon (excluding kei cars), also with the same 1.6-liter, which also received the optional four-wheel drive in the wagon.\n\nSuzuki restyled the Cultus Crescent and renamed it Cultus (for the Japanese market only) in mid-1998. In North America, the changeover took place with the 1999 model year. The car was given a new front end, with a rounder grille and new headlights, and the engine lineup was expanded to include Suzuki's J18A chain-driven DOHC engine that was fitted to the sedan and wagon. In North America, the Esteem 1.8-liter wagon completely replaced the Esteem 1.6, but in most markets the 1.8 sedan became the sports model. In some European markets, the 1.8-liter was installed in the hatchback and sold as the limited edition Baleno GSR. The Suzuki 1.8 had exactly the same displacement as the earlier Mazda BP engine, but was less powerful with only in European specifications. Europe also gained a diesel version, with a XUD9 engine supplied by Peugeot.\n\nThe Cultus was replaced in most markets by the new Aerio/Liana, which was launched in 2001. In Japan, the sedan was discontinued in November 2001, although the wagon remained until August 2002. The entire range was pulled from the market in Europe and North America in 2002, after one year of overlapping with the Aerio/Liana. The car remained available in many developing countries, including India and Southeast Asia, where it was sold until 2007, when production stopped at the Maruti factory, with the assembly line giving way to the SX4 sedan.\n\nA yellow Suzuki Esteem (with one red door) is used as Jimmy McGill's car in the AMC TV show \"Better Call Saul\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2184284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184284", "title": "Union Camp Corporation", "text": "Union Camp Corporation\n\nUnion Camp Corporation was an American pulp and paper company and a private owner of timberland in the United States. In 1999 it was acquired by International Paper.\n\nUnion Camp came about through the merger of the Union Bag and Paper Company and the Camp Manufacturing Company. Each of these family-owned companies had unique histories that led to the ultimate success of Union Camp until it was acquired by International paper.\n\nThe Union Bag and Paper Company's history dates back to 1881 where it began as the Union Paper Bag Machine Company in Bethlehem Pennsylvania under the Calder family. In the late 1920s, partially due to concerns about the labor union movement in the north, the company built a major mill (the largest in the world at the time and for many years) in Savannah, GA. This mill, and local politics, were the subject of Ralph Nader's book, \"The Water Lords\". The company had a major impact on Savannah politics, but was highly respected in the area as having kept Savannah from many of the severe effects of the Great Depression. The Savannah mill has a public golf course, named after Mary Calder, wife of the founder.\n\nThe Camp Manufacturing Company was founded in 1887 by 3 local Camp brothers from Franklin, Virginia. Paul Douglas Camp (President), James Leonidas Camp (Vice-president) and Robert Judson Camp (secretary-treasurer) purchased a small sawmill on the outskirts of Franklin. Paul Douglas Camp built The Elms, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The sawmill was purchased from Dr. Jimmy Jordan of Como, North Carolina. Under Dr. Jim Jordan, Camp Manufacturing Company of Franklin prospered and steadily increased in volume. By 1949 it utilized four log trucks, each with several times the load capacity of the first one. The business was grossing about $90 thousand a year.\n\nWith their new sawmill, they began expanding it and over the next 20 years experienced rapid growth. After a bout with near bankruptcy in 1907, the brothers borrowed the money necessary to continue operations. With the onset of World War I, the increased demand for lumber brought the company back to financial success. By 1918, the success of the company was obvious through the observations of the local community Franklin. With the stimulated economy, \"Franklin has become a booming wartime village...\" In 1925, with the passing of the final first generation Camps, the company was passed on to the second generation. This new generation brought the company into the paper production industry, starting with brown packaging paper in 1938 and eventually producing specialty bleached paper in the 1950s. By the mid 1950s, the industry competition was growing fierce with onset of extensive mergers within the industry and the Camp family needed resources to expand their capital intensive paper production. Until this time, the Camp family was in possession of 74% of slightly over a million shares of their company. Reluctant to forfeit this control by becoming a publicly traded company, the Camp family looked for other avenues. After meeting with several potential buyers, many who were disgusted at Hugh Camps high asking price, a buyer was found.\n\nIn May 1956, the merger between the 2 companies came together. With Union Bag company having sales of $123,031,000 and owning over a million acres (4,000 km²) of timber, it was surprising that the Camps negotiated as equals with the Calders, when the Camps had a fraction of the sales and property with $27,675,225 in sales and 240,000 acres (970 km²) of timber. After months of negotiations, and a final offering to the Camp shareholders of 1.75 shares for every share owned, a deal was struck. On 13 July 1956 the merger was completed and the Union Bag-Camp Paper company was born.\n\nIn the late 1950s, a product made from kraft paper was created for applications such as a core in doors, aircraft construction, marine applications, etc., wherever strength with light weight and buoyancy were critical. The product was called \"Honeycomb\" and it was unique in that it resembled a beehive, with the edges of the cells giving overall greater strength wherever it was used. The size of the cells could be changed and the thickness of the sheets could be varied to suite the application. It could also be impregnated with resins to make it stronger and waterproof. The manufacturing plant for this product was at Glens Falls, New York and a technical staff was maintained there for architects and engineers. Also, at this site in Glens Falls, Union Camp maintained a cave-like storage facility where microfilms of all the company's important documents, such as contracts and legal papers, were sent after filming. The necessity or inspiration for such an operation was the Cold War. \n\nIn 1999, the Union Camp Corporation was acquired by International Paper. At the time it was referred to as a \"merger,\" but was actually a takeover. Union Camp's CEO at that time, W. Craig McClelland had actually sold another paper company to International Paper in the mid-1980s, when he was also in charge of that company. He finally retired from International Paper's Board of Directors in late 2006.\n\n"}

It was founded at least before 1844, when Holy Rosary Church was founded. The cornerstone for the present church was laid November 2, 1844. Holy Rosary, a mission church, is a brick building on Hardin's Creek close to the Beech Fork River. Rev. Victor Francis O'Daniel O.P.M. mentions in his book \"A Light Of The Church In Kentucky\" (copyright 1932) on page 140 that a station \"... was possibly that of Wilfred Fields, where now stands Holy Rosary Church, Manton (or Blincoe)\".\n\nThis village was once known as Blincoe as is identified as such in the 1896 \"Kentucky Gazetteer\". Richard Blincoe was a resident at that time. It was known as Blincoe until (at least) the mid-1900s, as it appears on as such on the 1949 official Kentucky highway map for Washington County. Derivation of the name of this town has been attributed to the surnames of William Frederick Mandt and his wife, Mary Ann Harrington; however, the Kentucky town and U.S.Post Office named in their honor was Manton, Floyd County, Kentucky, ZIP Code (now inactive) 41648. The Mandt Family of Manton, Floyd County, were generous supporters of Catholic religious and educational interests in the region of Nelson and Washington Counties in the early-to-mid-Twentieth Century, and it has been suggested that Blincoe was redesignated as \"Manton\" in recognition of their support. However, Mr. and Mrs. Mandt were married in 1894, and any appearance of the name \"Manton\" prior to that time is not attributable to their family.\n\nNewton's Grocery has been located at this site for over 80 years. Once a general store serving the area and community, it is now more like a convenience store.\n\nManton is located at (37.714722, -85.35827). The elevation is above sea level. The community is located along Route 605, near where the Cisselville road intersects. It is a few miles north of Loretto where Maker's Mark whiskey is distilled.\n\nThere was a station house on the Beech Fork, a small river, where farmers would store their cattle and produce. In the springtime these waters would flood, providing a waterway which lead first to the Salt River, then to the Ohio River and thence by flatboat the boatsmen could make their way to New Orleans.\n\nSome companies of men from the Tenth Kentucky Infantry were mustered into Union service having come from the village of Manton. Most of the men from the Manton area were in Company G.\n\nJohn Hunt Morgan, the Confederate raider, passed through this area on some of his raids into Kentucky.

It was also found that H4R exhibits a uniform expression pattern in the human oral epithelium. \n\nThe Histamine H4 receptor has been shown to be involved in mediating eosinophil shape change and mast cell chemotaxis. This occurs via the βγ subunit acting at phospholipase C to cause actin polymerisation and eventually chemotaxis.\n\nThe 3D structure of the H4 receptor has not been solved yet due to the difficulties of GPCR crystallization. Some attempts have been made to develop structural models of the H receptor for different purposes. The first H receptor model was built by homology modelling based on the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin. This model was used for the interpretation of site-directed mutagenesis data, which revealed the crucial importance of Asp94 (3.32) and Glu182 (5.46) residues in ligand binding and receptor activation.\n\nA second rhodopsin based structural model of the H receptor was successfully used for the identification of novel H ligands.\n\nRecent advancements in GPCR crystallization, in particular the determination of the human histamine H receptor in complex with doxepin will likely increase the quality of novel structural H receptor models.\n\n\n\nBy inhibiting the H receptor, asthma and allergy may be treated.\n\nThe highly selective histamine H antagonist VUF-6002 is orally active and inhibits the activity of both mast cells and eosinophils \"in vivo\", and has antiinflammatory and antihyperalgesic effects.\n"}

He is a founding member of the German band Söhne Mannheims, and started two record labels, Beats Around the Bush and Naidoo Records. Naidoo also has a successful solo career. His debut album \"Nicht von dieser Welt\" (1998) has sold over 1 million records, and all his next six albums \"Zwischenspiel – Alles für den Herrn\" (2002), \"Telegramm für X\" (2005), \"Alles kann besser werden\" (2009), \"Danke für's Zuhören\" (2012), \"Bei meiner Seele\" (2013) und \"Nicht von dieser Welt 2\" (2016) reached number 1 on the German album charts. Most of his songs are in German, however, he has also released a couple of English songs.\n\nHe has been the subject of multiple controversies due to the content of his songs, political statements, adherence to conspiracy theories, propagation of far-right talking points as well as his use of homophobic, antisemitic and racist tropes. Naidoo is also a climate change denier.\n\nBorn and raised in Mannheim to South African parents of Indian, German and Irish descent, Naidoo worked in several jobs in the food and music industries before relocating to the United States in the early 1990s, where he released his first full-length English-language album \"Seeing Is Believing\" under his stage name Kobra in 1994. He currently resides in Heidelberg in his native Germany.\n\nAfter working as a backing vocalist for the Rödelheim Hartreim Projekt and 3P label mates Sabrina Setlur and Illmat!c, Naidoo released his first German language album \"Nicht von dieser Welt\" in 1998, for which he won an ECHO Award and an MTV Europe Music Award. Selling more than one million copies in total, it produced six singles, including \"Seine Straßen\" and \"Sie sieht mich nicht\", the latter of which served as the theme song for \"Astérix & Obélix Take on Caesar\" (1999). After his highly publicized departure from 3P, his third studio album \"Zwischenspiel – Alles für den Herrn\" was released in 2002. It spawned the top five hit singles \"Wo willst du hin?\" and \"Abschied nehmen\" and led to a collaboration with Wu-Tang Clan member and producer RZA, with whom he released his first number-one single \"Ich kenne nichts (das so schön ist wie du)\" in 2003.\n\nKnown for his soulful voice and his Christian lyrics, he has collaborated with several famous artists such as Deborah Cox and Swiss artist Stress. Naidoo was with Söhne Mannheims (Sons of Mannheim) earlier before he became famous, after his popularity increased he went back to the band and wanted to help them to become famous too, which worked. Nowadays he switches back and forth with doing some solo music or recording an album and going on tour with Söhne Mannheims. He joined groups like Brothers Keepers and the charity project (Signs of the Times) in early 2013\n\nIn 2012, he also collaborated in Xavas, a duo formation with Kool Savas, a Turkish-German rapper in the album \"Gespaltene Persönlichkeit\". The two had already worked together on a number of other releases.\n\nIn 2013, Xavier released \"Eye Opener\" on the vocal collaboration album \"Features\" by Kris Menace.\n\nOn 19 November 2015, Naidoo was announced as the German representative in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. His entry was due to be chosen from six competing entries in a national final in February.\n\nHowever, his selection proved controversial. Naidoo's right wing political views, coupled with homophobic lyrics in his 2012 song (featuring Kool Savas) \"Wo sind sie jetzt\", led to calls for his selection to be reconsidered. Within a day, an online petition had gathered nearly 15,000 signatories. Claudia Roth, a vice-president of the Bundestag for the German Green Party, also criticised the decision, citing the poor timing, with right wing political causes gaining popularity in the wake of the migrant crisis. On 21 November, it was revealed by the German broadcaster, NDR, that Germany had withdrawn the singer's participation.\n\nXavier Naidoo has blamed the Rothschild family for Germany's 20th century history and has spoken at a meeting of the \"Reichsbürgerbewegung\", the right-wing movement that seeks to restore Germany's pre-1918 borders, denies the legal existence of the Federal Republic of Germany and claims Germany is a country occupied by enemy, foreign forces. During the event he also denied the official account of the September 11 attacks, stating that \"simply put, whoever believes what was reported about this event is not seeing clearly\".\n\nNaidoo gave similar opinions in a live interview on ARD Morgenmagazin, public service breakfast television in 2015.\n\nIn March 2020 two video clips of Naidoo were released on social media, showing him singing one of his songs in the aftermath of the anti-migrant 2018 Chemnitz protests with altered lyrics. In these he stated about the migrants who recently arrived in Germany: \"Your daughters, your children shall suffer; Shall have to undress next to wolves in the gym; While you stand around placidly doing nothing\" and \"Far and wide, not a man in sight, who can save this country yet\".\nNaidoo was subsequently fired by the TV-station RTL where he worked as a judge on the casting show Deutschland sucht den Superstar. \n\nNaidoo also propagates climate change denial. He claims the Fridays For Future movement is orchestrated by the Antichrist. According to Naidoo the proof is to be found in the name of the movement, which abbreviates to \"FFF\", the letter \"F\" being the sixth in the alphabet, therefore symbolizing the Number of the Beast.\n\nNaidoo's music has been claimed to feature a utopian, pan-theistic ideology through which he expressed his own political anxieties and stances. Although he explores Christian, Muslim, and Rastafarian modes of living, his work has been asserted to be strongly grounded in Old Testament narratives and apocalyptic sentiments. Applying these to situations faced specifically in a \"Black German\" context, Naidoo has called for solutions not from the state, but from cross-cultural spiritual collectives. For example, in the lyrics and video for \"Seine Strassen\", the power of the state in terms of protection and surveillance is said to pale in comparison to higher spiritual powers.\n\nHowever his lyrics have also featured anti-Semitic slurs and homophobic sentiments. His 2012 song \"Wo sind\" implied that homosexuals were paedophiles.\n\nAlthough Naidoo does not engage directly with his own mixed German and Asian identity in his music, he was integral to the formation of an Afro-German presence in German popular culture. Specifically, his work with Glashaus can be said to have originated a distinctly Afro-German form of R&B, one which addressed the issues faced by Black Germans without invoking Black Germans specifically. Not only did Naidoo experiment with sounds from around the Black Diaspora, notably working with RZA, but was also a member of Brothers Keepers, an explicitly Afro-German and explicitly political collective. As lead singer on \"Adriano\", one of Brothers Keepers' most well-known songs, he has been seen to stand with the Afro-German collective and setting the tone for their message.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As a youth, he played in the 1980 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Peterborough.\n\nDrafted by the Detroit Red Wings in 1985, he was an offensive defenceman who displayed a lot of skill. During the 1992–93 NHL season Chiasson recorded a career-high 62 points and represented the Campbell Conference in the NHL All-Star Game. He was traded to the Calgary Flames in exchange for Mike Vernon in the 1994 off-season. Chiasson spent two and a half seasons with the Flames before being dealt to the Hartford Whalers in 1997 and continued with the team as they became the Carolina Hurricanes the following season. After spending most of the 1998–99 season on the injured list, Chiasson returned for the playoffs and scored a power play goal in Game 5 of their conference quarterfinal round with the Boston Bruins, which would end up being his last NHL goal.\n\nChiasson was also frequently a member of the Canadian national team, representing them in eight IIHF World Championships over the course of his career.\n\nOn May 3, 1999, after the Hurricanes were eliminated from the playoffs in Boston and returned to Raleigh, Chiasson wrecked his pickup truck on the way home from a team party at the home of Gary Roberts and was killed on impact. According to teammate Kevin Dineen, Chiasson refused to call a taxi or accept a ride home, insisting on driving himself despite a blood alcohol content later found to be 0.27, over three times North Carolina's legal limit of 0.08. Chiasson was survived by his wife, Susan, and three young children: Michael, Ryan and Stephanie. There is a sculpture garden created in his honor with life-size bronze portraits of his children playing around a pond and a plaque in his memory in Millennium Park, Peterborough, Ontario, the town where he was raised. The Stanley Cup was brought to this spot on July 27, 2006, by former Flames teammate Cory Stillman, after Stillman won the Cup with the Hurricanes that season.\n\nAfter his death, the Carolina Hurricanes established the Steve Chiasson Award to honor the player who \"best demonstrates leadership, perseverance, determination and dedication.\"\n\nNo player has ever worn #3 for the Hurricanes again, though it has not been officially retired.\n\nChiasson's older son, Michael played defence for the University of Michigan men's hockey team and wore his late father's #3.

However, after several months, Parisians desiring a return to order supported return of the Armagnacs.\n\nOn 23 November 1407, Louis, Duke of Orléans, brother of king Charles VI (known as \"Charles the Beloved\" and \"Charles the Mad\"), was murdered by masked assassins in the service of John the Fearless. Afterwards, John acquired considerable popularity among the population of Paris.\n\nHe aligned himself with a popular faction of butchers, the \"écorcheurs\" (flayers), named “Cabochiens”, after their commander, a butcher named Simon Lecoustellier, known as Simon Caboche. This group had its origins among butchers of the \"Grande Boucherie de Paris\", a relatively wealthy class of tradespeople not integrated within Parisian high & aristocratic class. In April 1413, in a bid to gain power, John the Fearless encouraged the Cabochiens to revolt. Riotous mobs, sporting distinctive white caps, assaulted Armagnac noblemen and followers, and their properties throughout the city. On April 27, they seized the \"Bastille Saint-Antoine\" and took prisoner its defender, Pierre des Essarts, Provost of Paris. (Pierre des Essarts was beheaded the following 13 July.) They also forced their way into the Hôtel Saint-Pol, the royal residence, arrested several of the king's men, and incarcerated them in the various prisons of Paris. They controlled Paris for four months, until the last days of July and beginning of August, when the revolt was put down.\n\nAcademics took this opportunity to propose administrative reforms known as the “Ordonnance cabochienne\", which limited the power of the monarch, giving, for example, greater fiscal control to the Estates General. Although the ordinance carried the name of Caboche, because it was published on 26–27 May 1413 during the Cabochian revolt, it had been prepared in January–February 1413 by the \"États généraux de Langue d'Oïl\". It was actually the work of advisors of John of Burgundy who imposed the ordinance on Charles VI, who signed it on 22 May 1413.\n\nHowever, the exactions of the Cabochiens and of the Burgundians were causing increasing dissatisfaction among the population who began to rise against the Cabochiens. On 2–3 August, the Cabochiens revolt was over. The Cabochiens who were unable to flee were executed and the ordinance was overturned on 5 September 1413. Simon Caboche was able to escape with the Duke of Burgundy.\n\nCharles d’Orléans, son of the murdered duke of Orléans, had married Bonne d’Armagnac, daughter of the count Bernard VII of Armagnac. The count was a brutal and powerful lord who commanded a number of troops from the Adour and Garonne. Putting himself at the disposal of his son-in-law, he took control of Paris. In recognition of his help, Bernard VII d'Armagnac was made Constable of France on 30 December 1415 in a letter signed by Charles VI.\n"}

Gregson hoped to find a way to bring it to life. He could not find a way to do this until the alchemist Diablo arrived and brought it to life under his partial control using his supernatural powers. However, Dragon Man broke his control and attempted to kill Diablo.\n\nAlthough Dragon Man is slow-minded to the point that he is incapable of speech, he understands orders given by Diablo and is a determined foe of the Fantastic Four (although the creature has always displayed a King Kong-like affection towards Sue Richards). Dragon Man is not especially malicious, although he is easily manipulated and provoked to violence.\n\nAfter his first activation, Dragon Man was later revived. He encountered Medusa and Gorgon, and fought the Thing and Human Torch.\n\nDragon Man was later studied by Hank Pym at his laboratory. He was restored to life again by Diablo and was defeated by Pym as Goliath and escaped. Dragon Man battled Hercules and the Avengers destroyed Diablo's army of Dragon Men.\n\nDragon Man was once found by the original X-Men and was considered an unofficial mascot of sorts. After a period of time on the team where he developed a deep affection for Jean Grey, Dragon Man had to be released to the creature filled island known in the Marvel Universe as Monster Island.\n\nDragon Man was reclaimed by Professor Gregson Gilbert and sent by Lemuel Dorcas to attack Namor. It was next used by Gregory Gideon to attack the Fantastic Four. Dragon Man was then sent by Machinesmith to attack Captain America. He became the mount for the extra-dimensional dragon rider Ral Dorn. Dragon Man then fought Hulk and Kate Waynesboro when it was under the control of Ringmaster and the Circus of Crime.\n\nDragon Man encountered the child superheroes called Power Pack. Gregson Gilbert later attempted to replicate the creation of the Dragon Man without the addition of alchemical interruptions, and this time succeeded. He created a number of androids based on other legendary creatures. These androids were defeated by Power Pack, and Gilbert and Dragon Man go to work at Disneyland.\n\nDragon Man was used as a servant of Aron the Rogue Watcher.\n\nHe faced Spider-Man during the \"Acts of Vengeance\", when he was unleashed on him by Wizard.\n\nIn addition to his servitude to Diablo, Dragon Man has served Super-Adaptoid and was also a member of the New Enforcers. In \"Spectacular Spider-Man\" #235-6, Roxxon Oil sprung him from a government containment facility in order to capture and dissect him to create robotic super-soldiers based on Dragon Man's powers. He was freed by Ben Reilly.\n\nDragon Man showed up in Africa under the service of mad scientist Eric Pain. Though the creature was under a full rage, he ended up defeated once more by both superheroes.

He was subdued by the Corps using a gravimetric net.\n\nAt one point, Dragon Man had been placed in the Negative Zone, and like most of the other prisoners, was conscripted into service when Blastaar attacked the prison. When the was sent in to liberate the prison, Blastaar sent Dragon Man against them. However, Komodo was able to use Dragon Man's attraction to her to convince him to switch sides.\n\nFollowing this, he seemingly reforms, as he, Artie and Leech were seen at Franklin Richards' birthday party.\n\nHe has since been upgraded by Valeria Richards and joined Reed Richards' Future Foundation. Valeria used her talents to upgrade Dragon Man to have super-intellect and have the power of human speech. Dragon Man would become an adopted member of the Future Foundation and guardian of the gifted children in that program.\n\nAs part of the \"Marvel NOW!\" event, Dragon Man created the Thing Rings for Darla Deering to wear which enables her to become Miss Thing upon some particles enabling her to transform into her Thing Exoskeleton (which was also modified by Dragon Man).\n\nDragon Man gains its powers from its robotic materials, design, and construction, as well as unknown alchemical potions used by Diablo. Dragon Man is superhumanly strong and durable. He is able to stand toe to toe with the likes of Hercules and the Hulk in combat situations. He can use the wings on his back to fly. He can also exhale methane gas (produced by his digestive system) which can be ignited by striking together his specialized teeth, producing flame hot enough to melt iron.\n\nThe Dragon Man originally could military press sixty tons. Since it was a machine imbued with magic the artificial creature never grows tired. It can recharge itself by eating organic materials, and its wings did not allow it to fly. It uses two anti gravity generators located in its body to propel itself.

Hammond is primarily known for his work with NBC Sports from 1984 to 2018. For many years, Hammond was one of the network's staple on-air presenters, along with Bob Costas and Dan Hicks. \n\nHammond is best known for his coverage of Thoroughbred Racing on NBC, coverage of Notre Dame Football on NBC from 1992 to 2012 and his coverage of the NFL on NBC from 1985 to 2011.\n\nHammond also served as the play-by-play announcer for NBC's coverage of track and field at each Summer Olympics from 1992 to 2016. He also announced the speed skating events during the 2018 Winter Olympics.\n\nHammond earned a B.S. in animal science in 1967 from the University of Kentucky, specializing in equine genetics and following in the footsteps of his grandfather, Thomas Poe Cooper, a former dean of the UK College of Agriculture and a former Acting President of UK. He began his career with WVLK Radio, where he was news and sports director. In 1970 and for the next 10 years, he was sports director for WLEX-TV. In 1980, he was named a play-by-play announcer for Southeastern Conference basketball games.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, he served as a sales announcer at the Keeneland Thoroughbred Sales and at thoroughbred horse sales in 16 other states. He is recognized as a specialist and national expert on thoroughbred pedigrees.\n\nHammond was the lead play-by-play commentator for Southeastern Conference men's basketball broadcasts by TVS (1980–1983), SPI/Lorimar (1984–1986) and Raycom Sports (formerly Lincoln Financial Sports and Jefferson Pilot Sports) from 1987 until 2009. Hammond had known his color commentator on the Lincoln Financial broadcasts, Larry Conley, since junior high school.\n\nHammond's tenure at NBC began in 1984, when he was named as a co-host of the inaugural Breeders' Cup alongside Dick Enberg. It was supposed to be a one-shot deal for Hammond, but network execs were so impressed, he ended up getting a long-term contract. He was the main host of the network's thoroughbred racing coverage until Mike Tirico took over in 2017.\n\nHammond's duties at NBC expanded to covering many other sports. He was the network's play-by-play voice for its coverage of Notre Dame football alongside analyst Mike Mayock. He was also the lead play-by-play man for \"The AFL on NBC\". Hammond also has been very much involved in NBC's Olympic Games coverage. At the Summer Olympics, Hammond served as the chief commentator for track and field, a position for which he debuted at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, where his broadcast partner that year was O.J. Simpson. Hammond has since said that, prior to the O.J. Simpson murder case, he and Simpson were great friends and got along well. Hammond also commentates on other track and field events shown on NBC. At the Winter Olympics, Hammond is the main commentator for figure skating and ice dancing. Hammond is sort of unique in that, unlike most of his NBC Sports colleagues, he does not live in or around the New York City area, opting to stay in his hometown of Lexington, a decision he made during his early days at NBC. Hammond isn't alone in this choice; despite being a New York native himself, Costas lives in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nHammond was considered the leading play-by-play candidate when NBC won the bidding for Sunday night NFL coverage beginning with the 2006 season, but ended up losing out to former ABC announcer Al Michaels after the latter signed with NBC. Hammond teamed with Cris Collinsworth to call the secondary Saturday Wild Card playoff game for NBC each year, including in January 2007, in 2008, and in 2009, but teamed with Joe Gibbs and Joe Theismann for the Wild Card playoff game in January 2010, as Cris Collinsworth partnered with Al Michaels in the 2009 season due to the retirement of John Madden after the 2008 season. Hammond also filled in for Bryant Gumbel as play-by-play announcer on the NFL Network's December 13, 2007 game featuring the Denver Broncos and Houston Texans on \"Thursday Night Football\", once more teaming with Collinsworth. \n\nHammond and Collingsworth also serve as the announcing team on the \"Madden NFL\" video game in 2009 and 2010. and \"Madden NFL 10\". The game is notable for how he mispronounced the name of then-Oakland Raiders cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha.\n\nHammond's work at NBC also included play-by-play commentary for \"The NBA on NBC\" and \"The NFL on NBC\". He called gymnastics, figure skating, the WNBA, the Orange Bowl and college basketball.\n\nOver the past few years, Hammond's health has somewhat deteriorated. On March 24, 2001, under two months before NBC was supposed to broadcast the Kentucky Derby for the very first time, he underwent an operation for diverticulitis, a disease that affects the colon. During the surgery, a portion of Hammond's colon was removed. However, even with the short amount of time between the Derby and his operation, Hammond managed to get healthy enough to make his dream of broadcasting his home state's most famous sporting event become a reality on May 5, 2001.\n\nHammond wasn't so lucky in October 2002, when he underwent open-heart surgery. He ended up missing the Breeders' Cup that year. Bob Costas took Hammond's place at the hosting desk. It was the only Breeders' Cup Hammond was not a part of until 2006, when ESPN had their first year of coverage.\n\nHammond and his wife, Sheilagh, have three grown children, sons David and Christopher and daughter Ashley. David has followed in his father's footsteps, becoming a radio commentator for Syracuse University's basketball and football teams and working as a play-by-play announcer for \"The AFL on NBC\".\n\nHammond has been awarded horse race broadcasting's top honor, the Eclipse Award (Media category), in 1984 and 1996. He was awarded an Emmy Award for coverage of the 1992 Breeder's Cup. He also won Emmys for sports broadcasting in 1988 (men's and women's basketball), 1992 (Olympics coverage of track and field and diving), and 1996 (Olympics Track and Field).\n\nHe was the first recipient of the annual Outstanding Kentuckian Award given by the A.B. Chandler Foundation, is a charter member of the Lafayette High School Hall of Fame and has been inducted into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame, University of Kentucky Hall of Distinguished Alumni and Kentucky Sports Hall of Fame. Inducted into the KY Pro Football HOF in 2006.\n\n"}

It opened in 1935 and is the oldest in the system. There are currently 26 stations open on the line. , the line is long.\n\nAs the line was the first formal one in the system, its history of development coincides with the history of the Moscow Metro's first stage altogether. In short it was to cut Moscow on a northeast-southwest axis beginning at the Sokolniki Park and continuing through the Three railway terminals and then past the city centre's main traffic junctions: Red gate junction, Kirovskaya, the Lubyanka and the Manege Squares. From there, a separate branch carried off into the Arbat Street and later Kiyevsky railway station, before it became in 1938 the distinct Arbatsko–Pokrovskaya line and, later, in 1958, the Filyovskaya line. The remaining part of the Frunzenskaya Branch went along the Kremlin's western wall past the Russian State Library to the future site of the Palace of the Soviets on the bank of the Moskva River and terminated near the Gorky Park.\n\nAlthough Moscow Metro prides itself on the best Stalinist architecture and the earlier Art Deco attempts, the stations of the first stage are very far from those. Instead they have a very classical taste to them, which blends nicely with the neo-classical atmosphere of the mid-1930s. It is also true that the overall construction of these early stations allowed the palaces of the 1940s and 1950s to evolve from them. Most of these stations are now officially listed as architectural heritage.\n\nFurther development was seen in the latter half of the 1950s during the construction of the Frunzensky radius. The line extended into the Khamovniki District in 1957 coming up to Luzhniki Stadium and then in 1959 reached the Moscow State University on the Sparrow Hills. This required crossing the Moskva river on a combined auto and Metro bridge including a station on it. However, due to the necessity of reconstruction in 1984, the station was closed, and not reopened until 2002. The Frunzensky radius was completed in 1964 upon the last extension into the new bedroom communities along the Vernadsky Avenue of southwestern Moscow.\n\nAt the opposite end, there were two extensions: one in 1965 across the Yauza River (also via an open bridge) to Preobrazhenskaya Square, and another in 1990 into the Bogorodskoye District.\n\nPresently the line has the oldest structures in operation, and thus several renovations have been carried out systematically. Recent changes include a second entrance to Kropotkinskaya in 1998, major lighting enhancements to Okhotny Ryad and Kropotkinskaya.\n\nIn the south, Metro completed an extension of the line from Yugo-Zapadnaya in 2016, adding Troparyovo in December 2014, Rumyantsevo in January 2016, and Salaryevo in February 2016. Metro is an 11.6 km extension to the town of Kommunarka on June 20, 2019, with the construction of four stations: Filatov Lug, Prokshino, Olkhovaya, and Kommunarka. Kommunarka is allow transfers to the Stolbovo branch of the Bolshaya Koltsevaya line. The city released initial station designs for Olkhovaya and Stolbovo in December 2017 and set an initial completion date in 2019.\n\nPlanned extensions in the north are hampered by the position of Cherkizovskaya and Bulvar Rokossovskogo which were built so as to become a part of the projected second ring line that has been in planning since the 1960s. Cherkizovskaya's tunnels have provisions for a second perpendicular station, that would allow the line to continue eastwards to the district of Golyanovo and meet the Arbatsko–Pokrovskaya line at Shchyolkovskaya. Such an extension, however, is not scheduled in the current official development program.\n\nTwo depots are assigned to the line, the #1 Severnoye and the #13 Cherkizovo. Starting in 1997 both depots have been upgrading to the new 81-717.5M/714.5M trains (all factory fresh). Currently all carriages of the old EF, EF1, Em-508 and Em-509 have been retired.\n\nWhen the line opened in 1935, trainsets included only four cars. By the middle of the 20th century, trainsets expanded to seven cars. In 2018, the Metro plans to extend all trains on the line to eight cars. This will add additional capacity to the system of more than 186,000 passengers per day.\n\nSubway car types used on the line over the years:\n\n- Series A, B: 1935 - 1951\n\n- Series V: 1946 - 1958\n\n- Series D: 1956 - 1986\n\n- Series E: 1966 - 2002\n\n- Series Ezh, Em-508 and Em-509: 1970 - 2008\n\n- Series 81-717.5M: 1997 - present\n\n- Series 81-717.5A: since 2010 (only one train)\n\n- Series 81-765.4/766.4/767.4: 2019 - present\n\n"}

{"id": "2184383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184383", "title": "Boiling-point elevation", "text": "Boiling-point elevation\n\nBoiling-point elevation describes the phenomenon that the boiling point of a liquid (a solvent) will be higher when another compound is added, meaning that a solution has a higher boiling point than a pure solvent. This happens whenever a non-volatile solute, such as a salt, is added to a pure solvent, such as water. The boiling point can be measured accurately using an ebullioscope.\n\nThe \"boiling point elevation\" is a colligative property, which means that it is dependent on the presence of dissolved particles and their number, but not their identity. It is an effect of the dilution of the solvent in the presence of a solute. It is a phenomenon that happens for all solutes in all solutions, even in ideal solutions, and does not depend on any specific solute–solvent interactions. The boiling point elevation happens both when the solute is an electrolyte, such as various salts, and a nonelectrolyte. In thermodynamic terms, the origin of the boiling point elevation is entropic and can be explained in terms of the vapor pressure or chemical potential of the solvent. In both cases, the explanation depends on the fact that many solutes are only present in the liquid phase and do not enter into the gas phase (except at extremely high temperatures).\n\nPut in vapor pressure terms, a liquid boils at the temperature when its vapor pressure equals the surrounding pressure. For the solvent, the presence of the solute decreases its vapor pressure by dilution. A nonvolatile solute has a vapor pressure of zero, so the vapor pressure of the solution is less than the vapor pressure of the solvent. Thus, a higher temperature is needed for the vapor pressure to reach the surrounding pressure, and the boiling point is elevated.\n\nPut in chemical potential terms, at the boiling point, the liquid phase and the gas (or vapor) phase have the same chemical potential (or vapor pressure) meaning that they are energetically equivalent. The chemical potential is dependent on the temperature, and at other temperatures either the liquid or the gas phase has a lower chemical potential and is more energetically favorable than the other phase. This means that when a nonvolatile solute is added, the chemical potential of the solvent in the liquid phase is decreased by dilution, but the chemical potential of the solvent in the gas phase is not affected. This means in turn that the equilibrium between the liquid and gas phase is established at another temperature for a solution than a pure liquid, i.e., the boiling point is elevated.\n\nThe phenomenon of freezing-point depression is analogous to boiling point elevation. However, the magnitude of the freezing point depression is larger than the boiling point elevation for the same solvent and the same concentration of a solute. Because of these two phenomena, the liquid range of a solvent is increased in the presence of a solute.\n\nThe extent of boiling-point elevation can be calculated by applying Clausius–Clapeyron relation and Raoult's law together with the assumption of the non-volatility of the solute. The result is that in dilute ideal solutions, the extent of boiling-point elevation is directly proportional to the molal concentration (amount of substance per mass) of the solution according to the equation:\n\nwhere\nthe boiling point elevation, is defined as \"T\" - \"T\".\n\nNon integer \"i\" factors result from ion pairs in solution, which lower the effective number of particles in the solution.\n\nEquation after including the van 't Hoff factor\n\nAt high concentrations, the above formula is less precise due to nonideality of the solution. If the solute is also volatile, one of the key assumptions used in deriving the formula is not true, since it derived for solutions of non-volatile solutes in a volatile solvent. In the case of volatile solutes it is more relevant to talk of a mixture of volatile compounds and the effect of the solute on the boiling point must be determined from the phase diagram of the mixture. In such cases, the mixture can sometimes have a boiling point that is lower than either of the pure components; a mixture with a minimum boiling point is a type of azeotrope.\n\nValues of the ebullioscopic constants \"K\" for selected solvents:\n\nTogether with the formula above, the boiling-point elevation can in principle be used to measure the degree of dissociation or the molar mass of the solute. This kind of measurement is called ebullioscopy (Greek \"boiling-viewing\"). However, since superheating is difficult to avoid, precise \"ΔT\" measurements are difficult to carry out, which was partly overcome by the invention of the Beckmann thermometer. Furthermore, the cryoscopic constant that determines freezing-point depression is larger than the ebullioscopic constant, and since the freezing point is often easier to measure with precision, it is more common to use cryoscopy.\n\nAmong many urban legends related to the effect of ebullioscopic increase, one of them leads to adding salt when cooking pasta only after water has started boiling. The misconception is that since the water boils at a higher temperature, food will cook faster. However, at the approximate concentration of salt in water for cooking (10 g of salt per 1 kg of water, or 1 teaspoon per quart), the ebullioscopic increase is approximately 0.17 °C (0.31 °F), which will arguably make no practical difference for cooking, although salt may add to flavors.\n\n"}

The screenplay by James Clavell and Edward Anhalt was loosely based on the 1962 novel of the same name by Alistair MacLean, written under the pseudonym Ian Stuart. The film score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The film featured the first use of a stabilized camera mount, invented by Nelson Tyler, placed on a helicopter.\n\nLee Barrett, a private investigator and former intelligence agent discharged for his outspoken views, is approached by a man with a tempting offer to join a political organization opposing bioweapons. His refusal proves the correct response, as the man is an impersonator sent by his former boss, Eric Cavanaugh, to test his loyalty. Barrett is asked by Cavanaugh to investigate the murder of the security chief of Station Three, a top-secret bioweapons laboratory in the desert of southern California—and the disappearance of its director and head scientist, Dr. Baxter. After they arrive at the station and wait for a time lock on the sealed laboratory to open, they are advised by another scientist, Dr. Gregor Hoffman, to seal the laboratory using concrete. Hoffman informs them that there are two lethal bioweapons in the laboratory, a strain of botulinus that oxidizes eight hours after its release, and a recently developed virus that he calls the \"Satan Bug\", which could kill all life on Earth in a matter of months. Determined to discover what happened in the room and taking extreme precautions, Barrett enters to find Dr. Baxter dead, with the vials containing the \"Satan Bug\" and 1200 grams of botulinus missing.\n\nA mysterious telegram leads Barrett to a nearby hotel where he has a surprise reunion with his old flame, Ann, the daughter of his superior, General Williams, who has flown in from Washington to supervise the investigation. Ann reveals that she sent the telegram, and that she has been assigned to Barrett as his partner, an arrangement neither minds. At her father's home, Barrett's speculation that a lunatic with a messiah complex is behind the theft is confirmed by a telegram, threatening to release the viruses unless Station Three is destroyed.\n\nBarrett and Ann discover another scientist from the station (not heard from since the theft) is lying dead in his swimming pool. A phone call to the scientist's home reveals the name Charles Reynolds Ainsley, a reclusive millionaire crackpot and pharmaceutical tycoon who fits Barrett's profile and quickly becomes the focus of the investigation. After a demonstration incident in Florida proves the thieves' willingness to use the botulinus, General Williams receives a phone call threatening to release more of the toxin in Los Angeles County unless Station Three is closed. The caller hangs up before he can be traced, but not before confirming that he is Charles Reynolds Ainsley.\n\nA police tip brings Barrett and Ann to the location of where a car broke down and was left abandoned during the evening of the theft. Deducing that the driver was involved, Barrett with Ann's help locates an airtight steel box containing the missing vials in a nearby stream, only to be confronted by two armed men, the thieves. They are taken with the box to the home of Dr. Hoffman, the other conspirator in the theft, who decides to take them hostage, unaware that they are being followed. It transpires that Veritti and Donald, the two men working with Hoffman, have hidden some vials with a time activating device in Los Angeles. At some point, the flask containing the \"Satan Bug\" is separated from the others by Hoffman, leaving the rest with Veritti and Donald, along with the hostages, despite an attempt by Barrett and Ann to overpower them. Soon the henchmen realize that they are being shadowed by two security agents in a car.\n\nAfter a confrontation at an abandoned gas station, Veritti and Donald decide to lock the two agents along with Barrett and Ann in the garage. Realizing that the thugs intend to kill them, Barrett persuades them to keep Ann as a hostage, and as they leave they shatter one of the vials. Though both agents are killed, Barrett survives by forcing an exit and setting the garage afire. After an unsuccessful attempt to radio for help, he stops a passing car being driven by Hoffman, who has pulled a double cross on his own men. Barrett makes a deal to learn the location of the flasks in Los Angeles in return for the closure of Station Three, aware by now that Hoffman is actually Ainsley. After they hear an announcement on the car radio reporting the closure of Station Three (which Barrett knows is false, having arranged it earlier), they are intercepted by two men revealing themselves as security agents. Arresting Ainsley, they take him and Barrett in their car towards Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Veritti and Donald are killed at a roadblock in trying to escape, the flasks they are carrying are safely retrieved, and Anne is reunited with her father, who assures her Barrett may still be alive, his body not having been found at the gas station.\n\nBarrett has realized that the \"agents\" driving him and Ainsley are more of Ainsley's security guards on their way to rendezvous with a helicopter flying above them. After single-handedly taking them down, he again confronts Ainsley, who threatens to break the flask containing the \"Satan Bug\", telling Barrett that he waited to steal the virus until the vaccine could be isolated, which is why Baxter and the other scientist were murdered. Now that the vaccine is in his blood, Ainsley is immune. He declares his willingness to destroy the world and then live on in it alone rather than give up the power he holds. The helicopter lands, piloted by another of Ainsley's men. Another uneasy deal is made between Barrett and Ainsley, and they fly off, eventually finding themselves above Los Angeles as it is being evacuated. In the meantime, a cryptic doodle left by Veritti leads Ann and the authorities to surmise that the other vials are hidden at the Los Angeles baseball stadium, and during an intense search, they are located in the ice of a concession stand, attached to a bomb.\n\nAbove in the helicopter, Barrett notes it is flying past Los Angeles, meaning Ainsley is pulling another double-cross. Barrett fights with the pilot who tries to throw him out of the helicopter, only to be thrown out instead. Barrett is in danger of falling out after him, but manages to pull himself back to safety. During the fight, Ainsley drops the flask containing the \"Satan Bug\", and as it is about to tumble out, Barrett grabs it at the last second. Having served as an army rescue helicopter pilot, Barrett successfully takes over the controls, then covers Ainsley with a gun, pointing out he has nothing now. Ainsley throws himself out of the helicopter rather than reveal the location of the missing vials, unaware that they are now safely disarmed. After contacting Ann and his superiors, Barrett prepares to land, commenting things are back to where they started.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2184409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184409", "title": "Albert Shanker", "text": "Albert Shanker\n\nAlbert Shanker (September 14, 1928 – February 22, 1997) was president of the United Federation of Teachers from 1964 to 1985 and president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) from 1974 to 1997.\n\nShanker was born on Manhattan’s Lower East Side (New York City) to a Russian Jewish immigrant family. As a toddler, his family moved to Long Island City, in Queens.\n\nHis parents, Mamie and Morris Shanker, were emigrants from Poland. Both were union members; his father was a union newspaper deliveryman, and his mother, who operated a sewing-machine in a knitting factory, was a member of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. The Shanker family's deeply held political views were staunchly pro-union, following the socialism of Norman Thomas and including ardent support of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal. The experience of watching his mother work 70-hour weeks made Shanker aware from an early age that there was a need for societal changes.\n\nShanker read several newspapers daily as a young boy, with an interest in philosophy. His idols were Franklin D. Roosevelt, Clarence Darrow, civil-rights leader Bayard Rustin, and American philosopher Sydney Hook.\n\nIn 1946, Shanker graduated from Stuyvesant High School, where he was the head of the debate team, and went to the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. He joined the Congress of Racial Equality. Shanker picketed segregated movie theaters and restaurants and was a member of the Young People's Socialist League and chairperson of the Socialist Study Club. In 1949, he graduated with honors and enrolled in Columbia University. In order to earn money while writing his dissertation, Shanker became a substitute teacher at Public School 179 on Manhattan's upper West Side.\n\nShanker took a year off after graduating from college and taught mathematics at an East Harlem school from 1952 to 1959. He began his tenure as a union organizer in 1959 to help organize the Teacher's Guild, a New York City affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers that was founded by John Dewey in 1917. Eventually, the Teacher's Guild merged with New York City's High School Teacher's Association to form the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) in 1960. During the 1960s, Shanker received national attention and considerable criticism for his aggressive union leadership and skillful negotiation of salary increases for New York City teachers. He left his teaching job to become a full-time union organizer. He felt that a teachers' union would be more effective if it were united with a common set of goals. In 1964, Shanker succeeded Charles Cogen as the UFT president, a position he held until 1985. In 1967 and again in 1968, he served jail sentences for leading illegal teachers' strikes. The New York City teacher's strike of 1968 closed down almost all New York City schools for 36 days.\n\nPerhaps Shanker is best known for opposing community-control leaders in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville district of New York City, which led to the 1968 strike after white teachers were dismissed from the school district by the recently appointed black administrator.\n\nFor more than a decade, Shanker wrote more than 1,300 columns in \"The New York Times\" and essays in other publications. Accompanied by a small photograph of Shanker, the \"Times\" columns, titled \"Where We Stand,\" sought to clarify the union's position on matters of public interest.\n\nDespite Shanker's organizing efforts and the 15 days that he spent in jail due to his organization activities, he was branded a racist by critics. Yet he persisted in building the United Federation of Teachers and was elected president of the American Federation of Teachers in 1974. He was re-elected every two years until his death.\n\nIn 1975, the UFT authorized a five-day strike, leading to allegedly saving New York City from bankruptcy after Shanker asked the Teachers' Retirement System to invest $150 million in municipal bonds.\n\nOn September 21, 1981, Shanker had dinner with Leon B. Applewhaite, a personal friend and one of the three members of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA). Applewhaite was involved in deciding whether to uphold the decertification of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization for the strike they had called in August of that year. During the dinner, Shanker urged Applewhaite not to decertify the union, an action which plainly violated the prohibition on the \"ex parte\" contact contained in the federal Administrative Procedure Act. Although the contact was not ultimately found to have legal consequences, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals criticized Shanker's behavior in their review of the FLRA's decision. (See 685 F.2d 547.)\n\nIn 1988, Shanker was the first to propose charter schools in the U.S. He was inspired by a visit to a public school in Cologne, Germany, in which teams of teachers had considerable control over how the school was run, and about what and how to teach. They stayed with each class of students for six years. The schools were integrated by ethnic and economic origins, and were originally intended to focus on the neediest students, drop-outs and those most likely to drop out soon.\n\nIn 1993, Shanker turned against the charter school idea when he realized that for-profit organizations saw it as a business opportunity and were advancing an agenda of school privatization. Indeed, the charter schools that were finally established in the U.S. were different from Shanker's vision. \"On average, charter schools are even more racially and economically segregated than traditional public schools,\" according to an opinion piece in the \"New York Times\" explaining Shanker's views.\n\nOpponents of the Vietnam war have criticized Shanker and other AFL-CIO leaders for supporting the war in Vietnam and other anti-Communist aspects of U.S. foreign policy.\n\nShanker was a visiting professor at Hunter College and Harvard University during the 1980s. He continued to work toward organizing teachers throughout his life and attempted to bridge the AFT with the National Education Association, which he never saw happen. In 1991, U.S. President George H. W. Bush appointed him as a member of the original Competitiveness Policy Council.\n\nShanker died of bladder cancer and was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998 by U.S. President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"Public schools played a big role in holding our nation together. They brought together children of different races, languages, religions, and cultures and gave them a common language and a sense of common purpose. We have not outgrown our need for this; far from it.\" (\"Where We Stand,\" March 3, 1997)\n\n\"There is no more reason to pay for private education than there is to pay for a private swimming pool for those who do not use public facilities.\"\n\n\"It is as much the duty of the union to preserve public education as it is to negotiate a good contract.\"\n\n\"It's dangerous to let a lot of ideas out of the bag, some of which may be bad. But there's something that's more dangerous, and that's not having any new ideas at all at a time when the world is closing in on you.\" (Speech to the AFT QuEST Conference, 1985)\n\nThe quote,\n\n\"When schoolchildren start paying union dues, that’s when I’ll start representing the interests of school children.\"\nis often attributed to Shanker.\n\nThe Albert Shanker Institute attempted to find the source of this quote, and concluded that \"we cannot demonstrate conclusively that Albert Shanker never made this particular statement... but, we believe the quote is fiction.\" The first appearance, which those at the Institute could find, was in the \"Meridian (Mississippi) Star\" newspaper, August 13, 1985, but no source is included in the article.\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

{"id": "2184423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184423", "title": "Bridge (exercise)", "text": "Bridge (exercise)\n\nThe bridge (also called gymnastic bridge) is an exercise. Many variations of this exercise are employed throughout the world, most commonly the balancing of the body on the hands and the feet. It is intended to improve lower back and gluteus strength. Examples of bridging in sportive or self-defense applications are seen in Kung Fu, Judo, Brazilian jiu jitsu, \nCapoeira, mixed martial arts, and wrestling. \n\nIn yoga, this particular pose is called Chakrasana, Urdhva Dhanurasana, or Wheel, while the Westernized nickname \"Bridge pose\" refers to a less rigorous supine backbend called Setu Bandha Sarvangasana, in which the body is fairly straight from knees to shoulders, and most of the bend is in the knees.\n\nThe bridge is frequently compared to the deadlift in terms of which muscles the exercises work, and as such the bridge could be considered the bodyweight exercise equivalent to the weight training deadlift. Just like its weight training counterpart, the bridge primarily works muscles which are part of the posterior chain, but also many important muscles of the anterior chain. A major difference between these two exercises is that the bridge tends to emphasise the upper, superior portion of the posterior chain, while the deadlift in turn heavily empasises the lower, inferior portion of the posterior chain. The following list of muscles only includes the largest and most significant muscles worked in the movement, and is not exhaustive.\n\nThe erector spinae muscles are the ones primarily worked during bridging. These muscles stretch all the way down the spine and work to extend the spinal column when they contract. The spinal erectors are also considered to be the posterior core muscles, and counteract the contraction of the rectus abdominis in order to stabilise the core region during bridging.\n\nThe rectus abdominis, colloquially the abdominals or \"abs\", works to counteract the contraction of the spinal erectors in order to stabilise the core region.\n\nAn effect which is almost unique to the bridge is that it works the posterior head of the deltoideus muscle, being the only common compound exercise to do so with the exception of the weight training row.\n\nSimilar to the deadlift, the bridge also works the gluteal muscles which work to extend the spine as well as the femur.\n\nThe second large muscle group primarily worked by the bridge, although with less emphasis than the deadlift, are the hamstring muscles. They extend from the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis to the heads of tibia and fibula, and work to flex the knee joint.\n\nJust like with the core muscles, the quadriceps muscles work to counteract the contraction of the hamstring muscles in order to stabilise the femural region.\n\nThe bridging exercise is not a singular movement, but includes a wide range of variations and progressions. There is no single agreed upon \"standard\" variation of the bridge like with other common bodyweight exercises.\n\nThe bridge hold is a static variation of the bridge exercise that involves getting into the full bridge as shown at the top of the article and holding the position, either for time or until exhaustion. This variation is possibly the most frequent variation of the bridge around the world, but is most commonly used in Calisthenics circles to build strength in order to progress to some of the more difficult bridge variations.\n\nThe bridge push-up involves lying on the ground on the back with the feet pulled up to the buttocks and palms of the hands against the ground on either side of the head, followed by \"pushing\" the entire body upwards with both arms and feet. The practitioner then pulls the body back to the original position and repeats the whole movement for a set amount of repetitions, or until exhaustion. This is also one of the ways to get into the bridge hold position, along with the closing bridge below.\n\nA great amount of further difficulty can be introduced to the regular bridge push-up by executing the movement only supported by one arm. This also introduces unilaterality to the movement, primarily working only one side of the spinal erectors, and especially only one of the deltoids.\n\nJust like above, the bridge push-up can also be executed with one leg extended. When this is done, not only is unilaterality introduced, but the hamstrings and glutes (as well as other muscles of the lower extremities worked by the bridge) are worked far more.\n\nWall walking is another popular bridge variation that involves standing with one's back to a wall at a varying distance, followed by leaning backwards until one can press one's palms into the wall from behind. The practitioner then proceeds to \"walk\" with their hands along the wall all the way down to the floor. To make the exercise more difficult, one can also finish the movement by proceeding to \"walk\" all the way back up again, then pushing off the wall with the arms back into the original standing position. This can be done for several repetitions.\n\nThe closing bridge involves standing straight up with varying foot distance, then slowly leaning further and further backwards with the arms reaching back, until one comes all the way down into a standing bridge. This is the typical way that gymnasts go into the bridge hold position above, but is also an excellent strength exercise in itself when done for multiple repetitions.\n\nThis variation is considered by some to be the most advanced variation of the bridge, and is by far the one that requires the most strength. It involves performing a full closing bridge as above, followed by \"opening\" the bridge again by either pushing off the floor with the arms or coming back into standing position relying solely on the muscles in the torso and legs. Furthermore, unilaterality can be introduced to this variation by performing the whole movement with only one arm.\n\n"}

{"id": "2184427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184427", "title": "Zamoskvoretskaya line", "text": "Zamoskvoretskaya line\n\nThe Zamoskvoretskaya line (, ), formerly Gorkovsko–Zamoskvoretskaya () (Line 2), is a line of the Moscow Metro. Opened in 1938, chronologically it became the third line. There are 24 stations on the Zamoskvoretskaya line, and it spans , roughly crossing Moscow in a north–south direction. A normal trip along the entire line takes 55 minutes, with the trains on the line averaging . While most of the line is underground, there are some pockets of surface-level or above-ground track, mainly at the point where the line crosses the Moskva River. The line contains many examples of original Moscow Metro architecture, and contains arguably the most photographed station on the entire network: Mayakovskaya.\n\nThe first stage of the line followed Moscow's busiest transport artery the Leningradsky Prospekt or as it moves into the centre the Tverskaya Street (formally Gorkovskaya hence the original name), and connected the northwestern districts of Aeroport and Begovoy along with the Belorussky Rail Terminal with the city centre in 1938.\n\nThe second stage, construction of which was uninterrupted during the war, opened in 1943 and followed the Red Square south under the Moskva River into the dense district of Zamoskvorechye (hence the name) and then onto the Paveletsky Rail Terminal and more significantly the Stalin Factory (ZiS) in the Southeast of Moscow.\n\nSeveral more extensions were to take place including the northern one following the Leningrad Highway and the Moscow Canal into the Northern River Port in 1964. A southern one in 1969 passed the Nagatino industrial district and the Kolomenskoye park, the rest of the extension went into the future Kakhovskaya line. In 1984 a third extension commenced in two stages to the southeast past the Tsaritsyno park and into the Orekhovo-Borisovo housing massifs. A flooded tunnel, however forced the new branch to close a day after and for the next two and a half months. In late 1985 the second stage was completed, reaching a length of 36.9 kilometres with 20 stations and a daily passenger traffic of 1.8 million people.\n\nThe line's complex and inspiring history is mirrored in its architectural ensemble, particularly as it is one of the few places that it is possible to see the best of Soviet pre-war Art Deco architecture. In the spotlight before all other stations is Mayakovskaya, a station that is not only most-photographed in the network but is also common sight on covers of brochures and tour guides into Moscow's underground realm.\n\nWhen the line first opened in 1938, to distinguish the simultaneous formation of the three lines instead of one, colour-coding was introduced. The first one, the Sokolnicheskaya being Red, for mostly political reasons. However chronologically the Arbatsko–Pokrovskaya line would have been second and was coloured blue, whilst the third one Zamoskvoretskaya was given green. However as part of the Arbatsko–Pokrovskaya line was already in operation from the first stage, the significance of the Zamoskvoretskaya line was far greater. As a result the line was listed second. This tradition has since been passed on in all ex-Soviet cities with the first line being red and the second/third being either blue or green. However some metros, notably Minsk Metro chose to deliberately reverse the trend. \n\nThe Kashirskaya transfer is a cross-platform one.\n\nThe line is served by the Sokol (No 2) and Zamoskvoretskoe (No 7) depots to which, respectively, 39 and 36 eight-carriage are assigned. The line began receiving 81-714/717 trains in 1980, replacing older E types in a programme which was finished in 1987. Some of these were upgraded to the .5 standard. When the Kakhovskaya branch separated from the main line, seven six-carriage trains were formed for it at the Zamoskvoretskoe depot.\n\nSubway car types used on the line over the years:\n\n- Series A, B: 1938 - 1951\n\n- Series V: 1949 - 1954\n\n- Series G: 1947 - 8th of December, 1965\n\n- Series E: 1963 - 1989\n\n- Series Ezh, Em-508 and Em-509: 1970 - 1989\n\n- Series Ezh3/Em-508T: 1978 - 1983\n\n- Series 81-717: 1979 - present \n\n- Series 81-717.5: 1988 - present\n\n- Series 81-717.5M: 2008 - present\n\nToday the line features a combination of stations that were built during different periods and some rebuilt since. Also it is one of the busiest in the system and for some stations, that are almost 70 years old clearly show their age. Improvement works have been carried out several times throughout history, but in recent times their emphasis has grown. Belorusskaya was recently subjected to an extensive facelift reconstruction on replacement of its old ceramic walls with new marble ones. The world famous Mayakovskaya station following the opening of the second exit in 2005 had its original vestibule closed for replacement of escalators. It is expected that additional reconstruction will be done on 1960s \"centepede\" stations including the replacement of old ceramic tiles with aluminium planes.\n\nWhen the line was built several areas were left with a straight tunnel provision for potential future built in of new stations. One of which was Gorkovskaya (now Tverskaya) between Mayakovskaya and Teatralnaya, which was opened in 1979. However several more remain: Sovetskaya between Tverskaya and Teatralnaya, Bega between Dinamo and Belorusskaya, Vishnyakovsky Pereulok between Novokuznetskaya and Paveletskaya and Moskvorechye (also referred to as Vasilyevsky Spusk) between Teatralnaya and Novokuznetskaya. The latter provision stands the highest chance of being developed as the vacant space caused by demolition of the Rossiya Hotel is likely to be filled with new office buildings and hotels.\n\nIn addition to the provisions, another station was recently approved to be built on the surface level track between Avtozavodskaya and Kolomenskaya. The provisional names were Nagatinsky Zaton or Prospekt Andropova, although the name Tekhnopark was selected. The station opened in late 2014.\n\nThe Metro completed the northern extension to Khovrino in 2017, making that station the northern terminus of the line. Belomorskaya, an intermediate station, opened on December 20, 2018. The extension creates the potential to further extend the line into the adjacent Moscow Oblast town of Khimki.\n\n"}

There is also a 26,000-square foot (2,400 m) infirmary at the institution. All of the facility is located at site which is kept secure by a lethal electrified fence and seven armed towers, as well as a roving perimeter patrol officer. Construction completed in 2009 added 1,344 beds to the original 2671, for a total capacity of 4,176.\n\nThe Tonopah Conservation Camp is associated with the prison. The Clark County School District provides the education program on site using 8 classrooms and 2 libraries.\n\nThe institution opened on 1 September 2000 and became the reception unit for southern Nevada. This facility was designed to be the first of several prisons to be built at this location. The facility presented many design challenges, such as electrical backup and water supply, and there have been difficulties in staff retention due to the remote location. The closest populated area to the prison is Indian Springs, north of the prison. To date, there have been two expansions. The first expansion, completed in 2004, added a prison industries building and a gymnasium. The second expansion added four more housing units.

The company was incorporated in 1936 to organize the ownership of a large tract of land that was consolidated from four Mexican land grants acquired in the 1850s and 1860s by ranch founder General Edward Fitzgerald Beale. The company now owns over 270,000 acres (1,093 km) in the southern San Joaquin Valley, Tehachapi Mountains, and Antelope Valley. It is the largest contiguous piece of private property in the state. Tejon Ranch’s agricultural operation primarily grows almonds, pistachios, and wine grapes, along with some alfalfa and the occasional row crop. Cattle leases cover about 250,000 acres (1,012 km), and depending on the season, up to 12,000 head of cattle can be found grazing on the ranch.\n\nIn 1843, the Mexican government made grants for the land that became three ranches: the Rancho Los Alamos y Agua Caliente; the Rancho El Tejon; and the Rancho Castac. A fourth tract, the Rancho La Liebre, was granted in 1846.\n\nAt the urging of Edward Beale, Superintendent of Indian Affairs in California, the Sebastian Indian Reservation was established in 1853 on Rancho El Tejon, and Fort Tejon was established by the U.S. Army in 1854 on Rancho Castac. These were federal projects, consisting of major developments and improvements, on what was the Mexican grantees' private land.\n\nIn 1855, Edward Beale purchased Rancho La Liebre. The Army abandoned Fort Tejon in 1864. Beale bought Rancho El Tejon and Rancho de los Alamos y Agua Caliente in 1865, and Rancho Castac in 1866. With the purchase of these four Mexican land grants, Beale created the present day Tejon Ranch.\n\nBeale's son, Truxtun Beale, sold the Tejon Ranch in 1912 to a syndicate of investors headed by \"Los Angeles Times\" publisher Harry Chandler and land developer Moses Sherman. Both also had extensive holdings in the San Fernando Valley. In 1917, some surviving Kitanemuk Indians lived on Tejon Ranch.\n\nIn 1936, the Tejon Ranch Company became a public company, with the Chandler–Sherman group retaining a controlling interest. The Chandlers' Times Mirror Company sold its stake in 1997.\n\nIn 2012, the ranch suspended all hunting, following a 2011 California Department of Fish and Game investigation into the illegal killing of mountain lions. The investigation was initiated by a whistleblower who filed a lawsuit.\n\nTejon Ranch is the largest private landholding in California, and today is owned by Tejon Ranch Company, a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIts principal activity is land development and agribusiness, increasing the value of real estate and resource holding on this land. The company operates in four segments of the economy:\n\nA large number of California native plants occur on as yet undisturbed land owned by Tejon Ranch. It is situated at a section of the state where several ecoregions meet and overlap: the Mojave Desert, the Central Valley, the Sierra Nevada, and the Transverse Ranges of Southern California. The interaction of unique geography and varying climates has produced high biodiversity, as evidenced by showy spring wildflower blooms.\nAn agreement between the Tejon Ranch Company and a coalition of environmental groups, announced in May 2008, is designed to permanently protect of the historic ranch. It is the largest conservation and land-use pact in California history.\n\nThe agreement was finally reached to conclude 20 months of off-and-on negotiations, but only after a marathon three-day bargaining session in April 2008. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger traveled to the ranch in May of that year to take part in the announcement, but the signing of the agreement was done in private in June.\n\nHighlights of the pact are:\n\n\nThree development projects are in the pipeline for the Tejon Ranch Company.\n\nThe most extensive of these projects, Tejon Mountain Village is a proposed residential, commercial, and recreational development that has been a matter of heated debate for years in the Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass. The development would include homes, commercial buildings, hotels, and golf courses.\n\nCentennial is a proposed new town, or planned development, on the Tejon Ranch property.\n\nThree large warehouses have been built by the Tejon Ranch Company as the first in what will be an industrial complex designed to compete with distribution centers in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Foreign-made goods will be trucked in from California ports such as Oakland and Los Angeles and stored until they are delivered to retailers. About a third of the park is expected to be declared a foreign trade zone, allowing importers to defer payment of U.S. customs duty. The site also includes commercial uses such as restaurants, automobile service stations, and a large truck stop.\n\n\n"}

The ZX-6 series motorcycle was Kawasaki's flagship 600 cc model in 1990 to 1994. It was then replaced in 1995 with the ZX-6R as the brand's 600 cc race replica.\n\nIn Europe the model designation differed, and was introduced in 1990 as the ZZR600. The same 599 cc engine powered the bike from 1990 to 2004, then from 2005 to 2008 it used the engine from the 2004 ZX-6R.\n\nThe first generation ZZR600 (ZX-6 Ninja in different continents/markets) was updated in 1993 with lighter and bigger valves and intake-exhaust ducts, more permanence in the cams timing, lighter pistons, ram air. The two parts chassis (aluminium frame and steel sub-frame) changed to a one piece full aluminium chassis, and aesthetic changes.\nAnalogue instrumentation included standard speedometer on the left that rose in single MPH increments up to 170. Unlike the Suzuki competitor, the Katana, signal lights on the Kawasaki's cluster were amber instead of green. Owners could also rely on a fuel gauge on the left (missing on D series) and a temperature gauge on the right which many motorcycles in the same class did not have at the time. Storage was minimal, but better than most sport bikes. There was room beneath the seat for the manual and registration, but not much else. An additional compartment could be found on the left side of the fairing and the ignition key was needed to open it. \n\nZZR600 in North America, marketed during model years 2003 and 2004 (as well as 2005 in Canada), was based upon a previous generation sportbike (Ninja ZX-6). This indicates the motorcycle is mechanically identical to the earlier motorcycle, and differs only in paint schemes.\n\nIn North America, the updated 2005 ZZR600 was a reissue of the 2001 (ZX-6R) model and remains unchanged save for a new, less invasive fairing stay. It is powered by the same 599 cc, liquid cooled, DOHC, inline four cylinder engine. \n\nNotably, the ZZR600 uses a carbureted engine, even in its later model years, as it retains its similarity to the 2001 ZX-6R model. As such, the ZZR600's choke control sits near the left handle grip. Most modern Japanese sportbikes employ fuel injection.\n\n"}

{"id": "2184479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184479", "title": "Squirt boating", "text": "Squirt boating\n\nSquirt boating is a form of whitewater kayaking or canoeing where the boat is designed to be as low in volume as possible while still allowing the paddler to float. Squirt boats are designed to use both surface and underwater currents to manoeuvre within the water. These manoeuvres can be used to effect navigational control or to perform tricks.\n\nPhysically, a typical squirt boat is similar to a whitewater kayak or covered canoe (C–1) but is distinct in the following ways:\n\nThe Shred, is basically a Bigfoot for a Medium sized paddler, its rating is exactly the same as the Bigfoot the only difference is that the Bigfoot is 20 cm longer end to end. If you want a Squirt boat with the same performances of the Bigfoot and Shred but for a smaller paddler the Maestro is the kayak of choice.\nThe Hellbender, is very different from the other two boats. It is good at white water paddling and is the best boat there is for flat water paddling. It is also very good on the surf as well. It is the best boat to get in to Squirt Boating with and also it isn't at all different from a playboat in how it maneuvers. So it also wouldn't be bad as a first boat either.\n\nSquirt boating originally evolved from slalom kayaks. Racers found that if they let the upstream hip drop into the current and slide the stern of the boat under water, they could decrease the amount of time required to make large degree turns (90+ degrees). West Virginia kayaker Phil Coleman dubbed it squirt because of the way the boats squirted forward with extra speed thanks to the trapped buoyancy of the stern and the shape of the hull and deck. It is analogous to squeezing a pumpkin seed in between your fingers and having it shoot out away from you.\n\nAfter this original maneuver was developed, a number of paddlers noticed that squirting was a lot of fun and introduced a new method of playing on the river. Squirts allowed the boats to get vertical even in flat water. The problem was that the predominant kayak designs of the 1980s were not conducive to doing squirts. Most kayaks at the time were more than 10 feet long and had a volume greater than 70 gallons (260 liters). Jess Whittemore, a kayak designer, designed the first chopped boats based on race boat designs that were intended to squirt. Then, one fairly well known paddler, boat designer, and paddle maker by the name of Jim Snyder decided to try and create a shorter boat that was designed to squirt that could also be used for running and playing on the river. The result, after many years of trial and error, was a radically low volume boat.\n\nSquirt boating is slowly becoming more and more popular. Because it has the best of both worlds, since certain ones are very good at doing tricks in (Underdawg, Hellbender) and others are very good at doing Mystery moves in (Shred, Kor) and some are just as good as doing both (Funk, Angst.) Also most squirt boats are very good at surfing.\n\n\n\n"}

There was also time for another win in the non championship Goodwood 9 Hours.\n\nBy 1956 the design was starting to show its age and Astons were putting their resources into the development of the new DBR1 but the DB3S still finished 4th at Sebring and 5th at the Nurburging 1000Km to finish 4th in the championship together with another second at Le Mans in the hands of Moss/Collins although due to the change of regulations following the 1955 disaster this latter event was a non championship race.\n\nThe DBR1 now took over as Astons main sports racer but there was one last swan song for the DB3S in the hands of the Whitehead brothers at Le Mans in 1958 with a second place after all the works DBR1s failed to finish.\n\nThe car won the 2013 Gran Turismo Trophy at Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.\n\nThe 11 works cars had chassis numbers from DB3S/1 to DB3S/11, with the 11th works car never being raced by Aston Martin. The 20 customer cars had three digit chassis numbers, from DB3S/101 to DB3S/120.\nIn 1994 a recreation car was assembled from original spare parts at Aston Service Dorset. This car carries the continuation chassis number DB3S/121.\n\nOriginally two works Aston Martin DB3S fixed head coupés were made. The change was to make them more aerodynamic than the open top bodied cars. However, they were unstable at high speeds and both crashed at the 1954 24 Hours of Le Mans. Both coupés were then rebuilt as open bodied cars.\n\nThree of the customer cars were also fitted with similar coupé bodies.\n\nIncluded are a list of victories by each chassis under Aston Martin.\n\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "2184516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184516", "title": "Common ringtail possum", "text": "Common ringtail possum\n\nThe common ringtail possum (\"Pseudocheirus peregrinus\", Greek for \"false hand\" and Latin for \"pilgrim\" or \"alien\") is an Australian marsupial. It lives in a variety of habitats and eats a variety of leaves of both native and introduced plants, as well as flowers, fruits and sap. This possum also consumes a special type of faeces that is produced during the daytime when it is resting in a nest. This behaviour is called caecotrophy and is similar to that seen in rabbits.\n\nThe common ringtail possum is currently classified as the only living species in the genus \"Pseudocheirus\"; the species of \"Pseudochirulus\" and other ringtail genera were formerly also classified in \"Pseudocheirus\". Several subspecies have been described, such as the Western Australian \"Pseudocheirus peregrinus occidentalis\", but the entire population may be a species complex.\nThe arrangement as the only extant species of \"Pseudocheirus\" is:\n\nThe common ringtail possum weighs between 550 and 1100 g and is approximately 30–35 cm long when grown (excluding the tail, which is roughly the same length again). It has grey or black fur with white patches behind the eyes and usually a cream coloured belly. It has a long prehensile tail which normally displays a distinctive white tip over 25% of its length. The back feet are syndactyly which helps it to climb. The ringtail possum's molars have sharp and pointed cusps.\n\nThe common ringtail possum ranges on the east coast of Australia, as well as Tasmania and a part of southwestern Australia. They generally live in temperate and tropical environments and are rare in drier environments. Ringtail possums prefer forests of dense brush, particularly eucalyptus forests. The common ringtail possum and its relatives occupy a range of niches similar to those of lemurs, monkeys, squirrels, and bushbabies in similar forests on other continents. It is less prolific and less widespread than the common brushtail possum.\nThe common ringtail possum is nocturnal and well adapted to arboreal life. It relies on its prehensile tail and rarely descends to the ground. They communicate with soft, high-pitched, and twittering calls.\nThe common ringtail possum feeds on a wide variety of plants in the family Myrtaceae including the foliage, flowers and fruits from shrubs and lower canopy. Some populations are also known to feed on the leaves of cypress pine (\"Callitris\"), wattles (\"Acacia\" spp.) and plant gum or resins.\n\nWhen foraging, ringtail possums prefer young leaves over old ones. One study found the emergence of young possums from their pouches corresponds to the flowering and fruiting of the tea-tree, \"Leptospermum\" and the peak of fresh plant growth. Young eucalypt leaves are richer in nitrogen and have less dense cell walls than older leaves, however the protein gained from them is less available due to higher amounts of tannins. When feeding, the possum's molars slice through the leaves, slitting them into pieces. The possum's caecum separates the fine particles from the coarse ones. These particles stay in the caecum for up to 70 hours where the cell walls and tanned cytoplasts are partially digested.\n\nWhat distinguishes the digestive system of the common ringtail possum from that of the koala and the greater glider is the caecal content transfers directly back to the stomach. Because of this, the ringtail possum is able to gain more protein. This is also done by lagomorphs like rabbits and pikas. Hard faeces are produced during the night while feeding and are not eaten, while soft faeces are produced during the day during rests and are eaten.\n\nThe re-ingestion of caecal content also serves to maintain the ringtail possum's energy balance. Ringtail possums gain much of their gross energy from reingestion. The common ringtail possum has a daily maintenance nitrogen requirement (MNR) of 290 mg N/kg. Common ringtail possums gain much of their MNR from consuming their nitrogen-rich caecal pellets. They would have to gain 620 mg N/kg otherwise. The ringtail possum recycles 96% of its liver's urea, which is then transferred into the caecum and made into bacterial protein. Only re-ingestion makes this effective and the bacterial protein must be digested in the stomach and the amino acids subsequently absorbed in the small intestine. This recycling also allows the possum to conserve water and urinate less. Reingestion allows the possum to live on low nitrogen eucalyptus leaves which is particularly important during late lactation.\n\nCommon ringtail possums live a gregarious lifestyle which centres on their communal nests, also called dreys. Ringtail possums build nests from tree branches and occasionally use tree hollows. A communal nest is made up of an adult female and an adult male, their dependant offspring and immature offspring of the previous year. A group of ringtail possums may build several dreys at different sites. Ringtail possums are territorial and will drive away any strange conspecifics from their nests. A group has a strong attachment to their site. In one experiment, in which a group was removed from their territory, it remained uncolonised for the following two years. Ringtail possum nests tend to be more common in low scrub and less common in heavily timbered areas with little under-story. Dreys contribute to the survival of the young when they are no longer carried on their mother's back.\n\nAs a marsupial, the common ringtail possum carries its young in a pouch, where it develops. Depending on the area, the mating season can take place anywhere between April and December. The majority of the young are born between May and July. The oestrous cycle of ringtail possum lasts 28 days. It is both polyoestrous and polyovular. If a female prematurely loses her litter, she can return to oestrous and produce a second litter in October as a replacement if conditions are right. The average litter is two, although there are very occasionally triplets. Common ringtail possum young tend to grow relatively slowly due to dilute milk with low lipid levels that is provided to the young. As with other marsupials, the common ringtail possum's milk changes through lactation. During the second phase of lactation, more solid foods are eaten, especially when the young first emerges from the pouch. During this time, the concentration of carbohydrates fall, while those of proteins and lipids reach their highest. The long lactation of the ringtail possums may give the young more time to learn skills in the communal nest as well as to climb and forage in the trees.\n\nThe young are first able to vocalise and open their eyes between 90 and 106 days of age. They leave their mother's pouch at 120–130 days. However, lactation usually continues until 180–220 days after birth but sometimes ends by 145 days. Both sexes become sexually mature in the first mating season after their birth.\n\nCommon ringtail possum populations severely declined during the 1950s. However, populations seem to have recovered in recent times. Because they are largely arboreal, common ringtail possums are particularly affected by deforestation in Australia. They are also heavily predated upon by the introduced European Fox. They are also hit by cars, or killed by cats and dogs in suburban areas.\n"}

In 2003 the words \"International Kadampa Buddhist Union\" (IKBU) were added to the original name \"New Kadampa Tradition\". The NKT-IKBU is an international organisation registered in England as a charitable, or non-profit, company. It currently lists more than 200 centres and around 900 branch classes/study groups in forty countries.\n\nThe NKT-IKBU describes itself as \"an entirely independent Buddhist tradition\" inspired and guided by \"the ancient Kadampa Buddhist Masters and their teachings, as presented by Kelsang Gyatso\". Its founder, Kelsang Gyatso, has sought to make Buddhist meditation and teaching more readily accessible to twenty-first century living. He also wanted to ensure that people did not simply study Tibetan Buddhism from an academic point of view, but learned how to extend this knowledge through meditation and practical Buddhist experience. The NKT-IKBU is described as being \"very successful at disseminating its teachings\" and Geshe Kelsang's books have been called \"very popular\".\n\nThe NKT-IKBU has expanded more rapidly than any other Buddhist tradition in Britain. It has been described as a \"controversial organization\" and a \"controversial\" new religious movement, a cult, or a breakaway Buddhist sect.\n\nIn 1976 the students of Thubten Yeshe founded the Manjushri Institute with Lama Yeshe as the Spiritual Director and purchased the assets of Conishead Priory, a neglected Victorian mansion in Ulverston (Cumbria), England for £70,000. The same year Thubten Yeshe and Thubten Zopa Rinpoche visited Kelsang Gyatso in India and invited him over to teach at the Manjushri Institute, which was a part of their FPMT network.\n\nAccording to David N. Kay, Kelsang Gyatso was invited in 1976 by Thubten Yeshe and Thubten Zopa, who sought the advice of the 14th Dalai Lama when choosing Kelsang Gyatso. Whereas according to a NKT brochure, \"Lama Yeshe requested Trijang Rinpoche to ask Kelsang Gyatso to become Resident Teacher of Manjushri Institute. Kelsang Gyatso later recounted that Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche asked him to go to England, teach Shantideva's \"Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life\", Chandrakirti's \"Guide to the Middle Way\" and Lamrim, and then check whether there was any meaning in his continuing to stay.\"\n\nKelsang Gyatso was requested by Lama Yeshe to lead the \"General Program\" of Buddhist study. In 1979 Lama Yeshe asked a Geshe at Manjushri Institute, Geshe Jampa Tekchok, to teach a parallel twelve-year Geshe Studies Programme, recognised and validated by the Dalai Lama and modelled on the program of studies for the traditional geshe degree. From 1982 to 1990 this program was led by Geshe Konchog Tsewang. According to a disciple of Lama Yeshe from this time, Lama Yeshe intended the institute \"to become the central monastery of the FPMT... one of the early jewels of the FPMT crown\" and \"the pioneer among the western centres\".\n\nIn the late 1970s, Kelsang Gyatso, without consulting Thubten Yeshe, opened up a Buddhist Centre in York under his own spiritual direction. Kay sees this as the beginning of a conflict between Thubten Yeshe and Kelsang Gyatso. However, according to Kelsang Gyatso, \"the opening of the Centre in York caused not one moment of confusion or disharmony\". Kelsang Gyatso was asked to resign so that another Geshe, described by Kay as \"more devoted to FPMT objectives\", could take over as a resident teacher of Manjushri Institute. Many students of Kelsang Gyatso petitioned him to stay and teach them, and on this basis he decided to remain. In the following years prior 1990 Kelsang Gyatso established 15 centres under his own direction in Great Britain and Spain.\n\nBoth Kay and Cozort describe the management committee of Manjushri Institute from 1981 onwards as made up principally of Kelsang Gyatso's closest students, also known as \"the Priory group\". According to Kay, \"The Priory Group became dissatisfied with the FPMT's increasingly centralized organisation.\" Cozort states that different disagreements \"led to a rift between Lama Yeshe and his students and Geshe Kelsang Gyatso and his, and eventually the Manjushri Board of directors ( Geshe Gyatso's students) severed the connection of the between institute and FPMT.\" According to Kay, Lama Yeshe tried at different times to reassert his authority over the Institute, but his attempts were unsuccessful. Kay goes on to describe an open conflict of authority which developed between the Priory Group and the FPMT administration in 1983. In February 1984 the conflict was mediated by the Office of the Dalai Lama in London. Kay states that after the death of Thubten Yeshe in March 1984, the FPMT lost interest because they saw it as a fruitless case. Since that time, Kay states, the Manjushri Institute has developed mainly under the guidance of Kelsang Gyatso without further reference to the FPMT, but legally remained part of the FPMT until late 1990.\n\nAccording to Kay, of the two Geshes at Manjushri Institute, it was Kelsang Gyatso who had always taken the greater interest in the running and direction of the Institute, and most of the students there were closer to him. The courses offered by both Geshes complemented each other, but as Kay remarked, they \"differed in one important respect: only Geshe Kelsang's General Programme included courses on Tantric Buddhism, and attendance upon these required the reception of a Tantric empowerment.\" Further, Kay argues that \"Lama Yeshe's and Geshe Kelsang's different ideological perspectives provided the conditions for the organisational dispute between the Institute and the FPMT to escalate. Kelsang Gyatso was already predisposed to support his students in their struggle with the FPMT administration because the organisation was inspired by a vision that he did not totally agree with.\"\n\nKay writes that, \"the determination of Geshe Kelsang and the Priory Group to separate from the parent organisation was uncompromising, and this was a position that only hardened during the following years.\" He goes on to describe the split from the Gelug school and FPMT as follows:\n\nKelsang Gyatso made a three-year retreat from 1987 to 1990 in Dumfries, Scotland and asked Geshe Losang Pende from Ganden Shartse monastery to lead the General Program in his absence, whilst Geshe Konchog Tsewang continued to teach the Geshe Studies Programme at Conishead Priory (Manjushri Institute). Different Lamas, including Thubten Zopa, were still invited. Especially the visit of Thubten Zopa in 1988 \"is significant, indicating the ongoing devotion of the students to this lama and their desire to leave the negativity of the schism with the FPMT in the past.\" In 1988 and 1990 the uncle of Kelsang Gyatso, Choyang Duldzin Kuten Lama – the oracle of Dorje Shugden – also visited Manjushri Institute. Before that time Song Rinpoche, Geshe Lhundup Sopa, Geshe Rabten, as well as other Buddhist teachers such as Ajahn Sumedho and Thích Nhất Hạnh have taught at Manjushri Institute.\n\nDuring Kelsang Gyatso's period of retreat he wrote some of his books and worked out the foundations of the NKT. Kay states: \"The first major development that took place during Geshe Kelsang's retreat was the introduction of the 'Teacher Training Programme' (TTP) at the Manjushri Institute.\" Kay comments the developments at that time: \"By giving his study programmes a textual basis, Geshe Kelsang not only provided accessible materials to enhance the focus and commitment of his students, but also laid down structures through which spiritual authority could later be concentrated exclusively on him.\"\nAccording to Kay, \n\nAccording to Kay, Kelsang Gyatso was gravely concerned that the purity of Tsongkhapa's tradition was being undermined by the lingering inclusivism of his Western students, something he had been outspoken for some years, \"but he now acted more forcefully in his opposition to it by discouraging his students both from receiving guidance from teachers of other traditions and from reading their books.\" Kay states that another result of these \"radically exclusive policies\" was that after the foundation of the NKT the Manjushri Institute Library, with over 3000 books, was removed. Kay goes on to state that, \"this began with non-Gelug books being removed, but as Geshe Kelsang's vision crystallised, even books by Gelug teachers became unacceptable to him and the library disappeared altogether. He thus became convinced that the Tibetan Gelug tradition as a whole no longer embodied Tsongkhapa's pure teachings and that he and his disciples must therefore separate from it. From this point onwards, Tibetan Gelug lamas would no longer be invited to teach within his network. This perceived degeneration extended to include its highest-level lamas, and so even veneration for the Dalai Lama was now actively discouraged.\" The pictures of the Dalai Lama were removed from the gompas and shrines of Kelsang Gyatso's centres. In 1990 Kelsang Gyatso became also outspoken against the Geshe Studies Programme, and \"made the pursuit of his new programmes compulsory.\" According to Kay \"As it was no longer possible for students to follow the programmes of both Geshes, the basis of Geshe Konchog's teaching programme at the Institute was undermined, and in 1991 he retired to Gyuto Monastery in Assam, India.\"\n\nAccording to David Kay, \"in 1991, through the successful exploitation of a legal loophole, the assets of Manjushri Institute finally fell under the sole control of the Priory Group\" (the close disciples of Kelsang Gyatso). In the Spring of that same year, Kelsang Gyatso announced the creation of the 'New Kadampa Tradition', an event which was celebrated in the NKT-Magazine \"Full Moon\" as \"a wonderful development in the history of the Buddhadharma.\" In 1992, the Manjushri Institute developed a new constitution, which constituted the formal foundation of the NKT. The Manjushri Institute was renamed the Manjushri Mahayana Buddhist Centre, and later the Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Centre. Since then, it has remained Kelsang Gyatso's home and the NKT's flagship centre.\n\nWith the foundation of the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT) by Kelsang Gyatso, he established a new and independent religious movement aiming to \"principally follow the teachings and example of Je Tsongkhapa\". This also gave a new identity to his followers. The many NKT centres which were built up rapidly by his followers could gather under the common auspices of the NKT and their spiritual guide, distinguishing and disassociating themselves from other Tibetan Buddhist traditions, especially the Gelug school from which Kelsang Gyatso originated. Kay argued that with these changes, Kelsang Gyatso provided a basis for the NKT to become a Western tradition whose \"spiritual authority could later be concentrated exclusively on him.\" Cozort describes this as unusual in the Tibetan tradition. The NKT described themselves as being \"an entirely independent Buddhist tradition with no political affiliations... that is appropriate to the needs and conditions of the modern world\".\n\nDavid N. Kay comments:\n\nIn 1998 Kelsang Gyatso stated in an interview:\n\nAccording to an NKT brochure, written by James Belither while secretary of the NKT:\n\nNowadays the New Kadampa Tradition describes Kelsang Gyatso's presentation of Buddhism to the West as Kadampa Buddhism with the following statement:\n\nMoreover, the NKT presents itself as being the continuation of the ancient Kadampa tradition by naming its school \"Kadampa Buddhism\" and equating this \"Kadampa Buddhism\" with the historical Kadampa School of Atisha:\n\nFollowers of the NKT refer to themselves as Kadampa Buddhists, the temples of the New Kadampa Tradition are referred to as Kadampa Buddhist Temples, and more recently, NKT teachers are named Kadampa teachers. Additionally, the Dharma centres of the New Kadampa Tradition are called Kadampa Buddhist Centres.\n\nJames Belither, the former secretary of the NKT, described the NKT as \"a Mahayana Buddhist tradition with historical connections with Tibet\", rather than a Tibetan tradition, and explained that Kelsang Gyatso wishes his followers always \"to present Dharma in a way appropriate to their own culture and society without the need to adopt Tibetan culture and customs\".\n\nWhereas the NKT celebrate Kelsang Gyatso as the one who \"is primarily responsible for the worldwide revival of Kadampa Buddhism in our time\", \"critics have described The New Kadampa Tradition as a breakaway sect or cult and argue it is not part of the ancient Kadampa Tradition but a split from the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism.\" Tibetologist Thierry Dodin has described the NKT as a cult, \"... on the basis of its organisational form, its excessive group pressure and blind obedience to its founder. The organisation's extreme fanaticism and aggressive missionary drive are typical cult features too.\"\n\nBluck remarks that there remains an apparent contradiction between claiming a pure Tibetan lineage and separating completely from contemporary Tibetan tradition. While the NKT strongly emphasises its unbroken 'lineage', it has no Tibetan followers and claims to stand outside current Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nBluck lists the specific traditional teachings that are seen as important in the NKT-IKBU: \"the nature of the mind, karma and reincarnation, the preciousness of human life, the role of meditation, death, and the commitments of going for refuge\", as well as \"understanding the Four Noble Truths, developing renunciation, and the training of moral discipline, concentration and wisdom\", followed by \"becoming a compassionate bodhisattva (by developing bodhicitta and the six perfections), understanding the ultimate truth of emptiness and finally attaining Buddhahood.\"\n\nThe NKT-IKBU's teachings are based exclusively on the teachings and published works of Kelsang Gyatso, which in turn are commentaries on Gelug works, especially those of its founder Je Tsongkhapa's texts. According to Helen Waterhouse, Kelsang Gyatso follows the Tibetan Buddhist custom of studying texts through the teacher's commentaries. With respect to the contents of the teachings she states that \"NKT doctrine is not different from that of mainline Gelugpa\", with a Prasangika Madhyamaka philosophical orientation, and emphasising the teachings on dependent arising and emptiness. The main practice in the NKT-IKBU is Lamrim (the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment), Lojong (Training the Mind), and Vajrayana Mahamudra (the practices of Highest Yoga Tantra). The books studied in the NKT are published by the Buddhist publishing house Tharpa Publications.\n\nNKT-IKBU offers three study programs: \"the open and introductory General Programme, the Foundation Programme for more committed practitioners, and the demanding Teacher Training Programme.\" The study programs of the NKT-IKBU are what distinguishes it from all other Buddhist traditions. Giving an overview of the purpose of the programs, the NKT-IKBU says: \"Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso has designed three special Study Programs for the systematic study and practice of Kadampa Buddhism that are especially suited to the modern world.\" It is believed by NKT-IKBU followers that the teachings transmit the pure lineage of Je Tsongkhapa in its entirety.\n\nThe three spiritual programs are:\n\nNKT-IKBU meditation practices include traditional Lamrim subjects such as \"precious human life, death and rebirth, karma and samsara, taking refuge, the development of equanimity, kindness and compassion towards all beings, bodhicitta, understanding emptiness, and relying on a spiritual guide.\"\n\nChanted prayers follow \"a traditional Tibetan format\":\n\n\nWhile the Je Tsongkhapa and Dorje Shugden practices are recited daily, NKT-IKBU practitioners also regularly perform a number of other ritual practices, including Avalokiteshvara, Heruka, Vajrayogini, Tara, Manjushri, Amitayus and the Medicine Buddha. Bluck notes that \"All these sādhanas have either been 'compiled from traditional sources' by Geshe Kelsang or translated under his supervision.\"\n\nFrom its inception, NKT-IKBU Dharma centres followed a common calendar for religious observances, including some of the traditional Buddhist religious days. These include the following:\n\nMonthly observances of Buddha Tara, Je Tsongkhapa, Eight Mahayana Precepts, and Dorje Shugden practices:\n\nAnnual holidays common to other Buddhist traditions: \n\nAnnual holidays unique to the NKT-IKBU:\n\nIn 2004, the dates of lunar month observances were changed to the respective days in the common calendar.\n\nNKT Day commemorates the founding of the NKT-IKBU, while International Temples Day is an opportunity to reflect on the importance of building Kadampa Buddhist Temples throughout the world.\n\nThree annual Buddhist NKT Festivals are held each year: (1) The Spring Festival – held at Manjushri KMC in UK; (2) The Summer Festival – held at Manjushri KMC in UK; (3) The Fall Festival – held at various locations outside the UK. These are taught by the General Spiritual Director of the New Kadampa Tradition, currently Gen-la Kelsang Dekyong, and include teachings and empowerments from the Spiritual Director, reviews and meditations led by senior NKT Teachers, chanted meditations and offering ceremonies, and meditation retreats. They are attended by between 2000 and 6000 people from around the world.\n\nWithin the NKT-IKBU community there are over 700 monks and nuns. Ordination ceremonies are usually held twice a year in the main NKT Temple at Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Center in Cumbria (UK), Ulverston. To ordain, one must ask Kelsang Gyatso's permission, and also the permission of his or her parents.\n\nBuddha established both lay and ordained Pratimoksha vows, and established several levels of ordination vows. Traditionally, the different levels of ordination are distinguished by the specific number of vows taken, and by the ceremony in which they were received. In the NKT-IKBU, Kelsang Gyatso established a simplified tradition of ordination with ten vows that summarise the entire Vinaya, and a single ordination ceremony.\n\nThe 10 vows in New Kadampa Tradition ordination are identical for both nuns and monks:\n\n\nIn \"The Ordination Handbook\", Kelsang Gyatso describes these vows as being easier to integrate into today's society, saying:\n\nHe also says:\n\nThe ordination tradition of the NKT-IKBU differs from that of other Buddhist groups in that it is based on the Mahayana \"Perfection of Wisdom Sutras\" instead of the Hinayana \"Vinaya Sutras\". According to Kelsang Gyatso, \"The Perfection of Wisdom Sutras are our Vinaya and Lamrim is its commentary.\" Robert Bluck observed that in the NKT-IKBU a \"Vinaya Sutras\"-based \"full ordination is not available, and those who do ordain remain as novices, though again this is common in Tibet.\" Kelsang Gyatso explains that when a person is first ordained they receive a Rabjung (preliminary) ordination; when their renunciation improves and deepens, their ordination naturally transforms into a Getsul (sramanera) ordination; and when their renunciation becomes \"a spontaneous wish to attain nirvana\", their ordination naturally transforms into a Gelong (bhikkhu) ordination. For this reason, Kelsang Gyatso does not require a separate ritual ordination ceremony.\n\nMonks and nuns in the NKT-IKBU abandon the physical signs of a lay person by shaving their head and wearing the maroon and yellow robes of an ordained person. They are given a new name which starts with \"Kelsang\", since it is traditional for ordinees to receive part of the ordaining master's name (in this case, Kelsang Gyatso). They also engage in a Sojong ceremony twice a month to purify and restore their vows.\n\nMonastics who break their ordination vows must leave their Centre for a year, with the exception of attending various bigger courses, Celebrations and Festivals. After that year, \"with some conditions\" they can return but cannot teach or participate in the Teacher Training Program.\n\nPractitioners who wish to ordain approach their Buddhist teacher when they feel ready, and request formal permission once they have their teacher's consent. They may decide to live in one of the NKT-IKBU's many Buddhist centres, but this is not a requirement. They are, in general, not financially provided for by the NKT-IKBU. And, if they live in an NKT-IKBU Dharma centre, they still have to pay rent for their accommodation and pay for meals and the spiritual programs. To finance this, some have part-time or full-time work. According to Belither, \"a few people are sponsored because of their NKT work but others are on 'extended working visits' or work locally, and some are legitimately on employment benefit.\" When working, they may \"wear ordinary clothes if this is more convenient.\"\n\nThe NKT-IKBU traces its spiritual lineage through these main Buddhist figures:\n\n\nAfter leaving Tibet in 1959, Kelsang Gyatso taught and engaged in retreat in India for 18 years. Trijang Rinpoche, the root Guru of Kelsang Gyatso, asked him to be the resident teacher at Manjushri Institute (now known as Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Centre) in England. Kelsang Gyatso taught the General Program at Manjushri from 1976 to 1987.\n\nIn 1987, Kelsang Gyatso entered a 3-year retreat at Tharpaland in Dumfries, Scotland. During his retreat, he wrote five books and established the foundations of the NKT-IKBU. Since that time, the NKT-IKBU has grown to comprise over 1,100 Centres and groups throughout 40 countries.\n\nAfter completing his retreat in the spring of 1991, Kelsang Gyatso announced the creation of the NKT-IKBU, an event which was celebrated by his students in the NKT-IKBU magazine \"Full Moon\" as \"a wonderful development in the history of the Buddhadharma.\"\n\nIn 1992, the NKT-IKBU was legally incorporated under English law, which constituted the formal foundation of the NKT-IKBU. The many Dharma Centres that were following Kelsang Gyatso's spiritual direction were gathered under the common auspices of the NKT-IKBU, with him as their General Spiritual Director (GSD). He remained GSD until August 2009 when he retired and was replaced by his successor, Gen-la Kelsang Khyenrab. Each of the individual Centers is legally and financially independent.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1995 Gelong Thubten Gyatso was designated as Kelsang Gyatso's future successor. He disrobed in 1995, and Kelsang Gyatso provisionally appointed 4 'Gen-las', i.e. Losang Kelsang, Kelsang Jangsem, Kelsang Dekyong and Samden Gyatso. After about a year, the former two resigned as Gen-las and were re-appointed as Resident Teachers. Samden Gyatso became the Deputy Spiritual Director and successor to Kelsang Gyatso while Kelsang Dekyong was appointed as the US National Spiritual Director. From this time onwards, the Deputy Spiritual Director also held the appointment of Resident Teacher at Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Centre.\n\nIn February 2007 Samden Gyatso resigned as Deputy Spiritual Director. Kelsang Khyenrab was appointed as Deputy Spiritual Director and became the General Spiritual Director when Kelsang Gyatso retired in Summer 2009.\n\nIn August 2001, Kelsang Gyato established a system of democratic succession for the General Spiritual Director of the NKT- IKBU. The \"Internal Rules\" state:\n\nIn 2008, Gen-la Khyenrab became Acting General Spiritual Director, under Kelsang Gyatso's supervision, and assumed the post of General Spiritual Director in August 2009 for a four-year term. Gen-la Dekyong, the National Spiritual Director of the United States of America, has in turn assumed the post of Deputy Spiritual Director, while retaining her post as US National Spiritual Director in accordance with the \"Internal Rules\". Gen-la Khyenrab retired as the General Spiritual Director due to ill health in April 2010 and, in accordance with the \"Internal Rules\", Gen-la Dekyong was appointed as General Spiritual Director. Her position as Deputy Spiritual Director was taken by Gen-la Kunsang.\n\nAlongside Kelsang Gyatso, who as founder and former spiritual director was the main teacher of the NKT-IKBU and his successors, all teachings (i.e. the three study programs) are held by Western students; lay persons and ordained alike. Qualification as an NKT-IKBU Dharma teacher is generally achieved by attending the NKT-IKBU's own Teacher Training Program, which Kelsang Gyatso regards as \"a western equivalent to the traditional Tibetan Geshe degree.\"\n\nCozort has noted that \"Several of the most prominent Tibetan teachers have long recognized themselves the need to train Westerners as Dharma teachers.\" Kelsang Gyatso explained the importance of Western Dharma teachers to the flourishing of Dharma in the world, saying that one fully qualified teacher is worth a thousand enlightened students. He expounded on the qualifications of NKT-IKBU teachers in 1990:\n\nRegarding the qualifications of NKT-IKBU teachers, Kay observed that \"Whilst personal experience of the teachings is considered important, the dominant view within the NKT is that the main qualification of a teacher is their purity of faith and discipleship.\"\n\nAccording to Robert Bluck, \"Most teachers are appointed to centres by Kelsang Gyatso before they have completed the Teaching Training Programme and continue studying by correspondence, with an intensive study programme at Manjushri each summer.\" Daniel Cozort explained that this is \"rather like graduate students who teach undergraduate courses while pursuing their own Ph.D.'s.\"\n\nKelsang Gyatso has said that monks, nuns, lay men and lay women can all become Spiritual Guides if they have the necessary experience, qualities and training. All NKT-IKBU teachers, lay and ordained, study on the same study and retreat programmes. The \"Internal Rules\" specify the criteria for completing the programme:\n\nIn addition to the TTP commitment, all Resident Teachers have to attend International Teacher Training Program each year, taught in repeated rotation according to a sixteen-year study scheme.\n\nOrdained and lay Resident Teachers who have taught successfully for four years are given the titles 'Gen' and 'Kadam', respectively.\n\nKelsang Samden was appointed by Kelsang Gyatso as the General Spiritual Director of the New Kadampa Tradition in 2005. In 2008 he was disrobed and effectively excommunicated by Kelsang Gyatso following a sexual scandal, whereby Kelsang Samden was accused of attempting to establish his own sexual lineage in the New Kadampa Tradition by engaging in sexual relations with ordained and lay female NKT members, under the guise of such activities being part of Highest Yoga Tantra spiritual practice. It was alleged that his activities had caused great harm to the women concerned, with at least one of the women involved falling pregnant and attempting suicide. Kelsang Samden denied any wrongdoing but disappeared from the organisation into obscurity under a cloud of disgrace.\n\nKelsang Khyenrab who studied and practised Buddhism since 1980 under the guidance of Kelsang Gyatso, was formerly General Spiritual Director of the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT). In 2008, Khyenrab became Acting Spiritual Director, under Kelsang Gyatso's supervision, and assumed the post of Spiritual Director in August 2009 for a four-year term. As Spiritual Director, Khyenrab was the Resident Teacher at Manjushri Temple and Kadampa Meditation Centre, the Mother Center of New Kadampa Buddhism. He Khyenrab resigned in 2010, for health reasons, and was replaced by Kelsang Dekyong.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1995 Gelong Thubten Gyatso (a.k.a. Gen Thubten or Neil Elliot) was appointed as a 'Gen-la' and Resident Teacher of Madhyamaka Centre (Pocklington, York) and as Kelsang Gyatso's future successor. He was described by the NKT as \"the first qualified English Tantric meditation master in Britain\" and was known as the 'heart-disciple' of Geshe Kelsang who wrote a prayer for his long life which was recited regularly at NKT centres. According to Madeleine Bunting \"Gen Thubten [..] is described by former members as having been the 'power behind the throne'.\" Bunting states further that \"Former members understand that Gen Thubten was disrobed because of a breach of his monastic vows. He was deeply revered by the 3,000 NKT members for his knowledge of Buddhism and his charismatic teaching.\"\n\nThe legal document \"A Moral Discipline Guide: The Internal Rules of The New Kadampa Tradition – International Kadampa Buddhist Union\" explains that the NKT-IKBU\n\nThe New Kadampa Truth website explains: \"Its Internal Rules – containing numerous checks and balances on the behavior, election and dismissal of the administrators, teachers, and spiritual directors – also guard against any extreme behavior and are legally binding.\" An NBO member describes them:\n\nThe NKT-IKBU currently lists more than 200 centres and around 900 branch classes/study groups in 40 countries, with an estimated 8,000 members. The centres are independent charitable corporations, and the groups are branches off an established centre which meet weekly in places such as churches and community centres.\n\nIn comparison, Waterhouse says the NKT-IKBU \"is very good at marketing its product\", with Centers and branches producing leaflets that advertise local NKT-IKBU groups in their respective towns, a level of publicity that according to Jones is comparatively more \"forceful and extroverted\" with regard to other Buddhist groups, and has helped the NKT-IKBU to achieve \"a phenomenal increase in membership and centres.\" Another attraction is the high level of activity at an NKT-IKBU Dharma centre, where it is often possible to be taking part at the centre every day of the week, in contrast to other groups \"which meet on a weekly basis but provide little other support or activity.\"\n\nBluck attributes NKT-IKBU's rapid growth to \"a wish to share the Dharma rather than ‘conversion and empire-building’.\" Kay says that the NKT-IKBU is sensitive to criticism on the subject of expansion and cites Kelsang Gyatso's response to any criticisms about its outreach efforts, stating that \"every organization 'tries to attract more people with appropriate publicity.'\"\n\nNew Dharma centres are expected to be self-supporting, as neither Kelsang Gyatso nor the NKT-IKBU owns the centres.\n\nA Kadampa Meditation Centre (KMC) is a Kadampa Dharma Center that serves the local, national, and international communities. A KMC is generally more centrally organised than regular Kadampa Buddhist Centers. Besides having a program of courses for the local community, KMCs host major gatherings such as Dharma Celebrations, National Festivals, and International Festivals. They are also home to the International Kadampa Temples. KMCs are non-profit organisations and all their annual profits are donated to the International Temples Project. There are currently 18 KMCs around the world, with several in the US.\n\nThe NKT-IKBU has established a Kadampa Buddhist Temple in the United Kingdom, as well as in Canada, the United States, and Spain; recently opened a Temple in Brazil, with plans to build one in Germany too. The NKT-IKBU states in its publicity that:\n"}

The invasion began with the bombing of Belgrade and the crossing of the border by the Germans on 6 April.\n\nThe Third Army faced the Yugoslavian First Army. By the time the Hungarians crossed the border and finally attacked, the Germans had been attacking Yugoslavia for over a week. As a result, the Yugoslavs put up little resistance to the Hungarians. Units of the Hungarian Third Army advanced into a triangular shaped area known as the Baranya-triangle between the Danube River and the Drava River. The Hungarians suffered few casualties in this invasion. As a result of participating in the invasion of Yugoslavia, Hungary regained Bácska and Baranya.\n\nFrom 25 March to 15 April 1944, the Hungarian VII Army Corps was involved in the Battle of Kamenets-Podolsky pocket. The Hungarian VII Army Corps was to become part of the Hungarian Third Army in August.\n\nOn 30 August, the Hungarian Third Army was mobilized to defend Hungary against the relentless advances of the Soviet 2nd and 4th Ukrainian Fronts. The Chief of Staff of the Hungarian Armed Forces, Colonel-General János Vörös, ordered this army of nine weak, undermanned, and underequipped reserve divisions to attack west of the Hungarian Second Army (which was mobilized at the same time). The Third Army was to then cross Arad and the Maros Valley and occupy the mountain passes of Transylvania. This attack failed.\n\nOn 6 October, in the opening stages of the Battle of Debrecen, the Hungarian Third Army was badly mauled near Arad. Very quickly, the army was scattered near the town of Kecskemét. Rodion Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front attempted a pincer maneuver to encircle Army Group Fretter-Pico. The 2nd Ukrainian Front's southern pincer sliced easily through the Hungarian Third Army. This southern pincer was spearheaded by Soviet General Issa Pliyev's Mobile Group Pliyev. Later, in the same battle, Mobile Group Pliyev was encircled and badly mauled by Army Group Fretter-Pico (\"Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico\"). The northern pincer was stalled and turned back by veteran German \"panzer\" forces. The Hungarian Second Army was an integral part of the victorious German-Hungarian \"Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico\".\n\nThe Order Of Battle in October 1944 was as follows:\n\nThe Hungarian Second Army was disbanded on 1 December 1944, after the Battle of Debrecen, and its remaining units were transferred to the Third Army.\n\nFrom 29 December 1944, the Hungarian capital city, Budapest was under siege. In the Battle of Budapest every available Hungarian unit was employed in the defense of the capital. After great loss, the city was unconditionally surrendered on 13 February 1945.\n\nBetween 16 March and 25 March 1945, most of what was left of the Hungarian Third Army was surrounded and destroyed about forty kilometers to the west of Budapest. The army was destroyed by the Soviet 46th Army as it advanced towards Vienna. But, even after this, the Hungarian Third Army did not totally cease to exist. Some remnants remained and they fought on. Fighting as they went, they moved progressively westward to southern Austria. The army was not officially disbanded until 8 May 1945, the end of the war. That is when the last commander of the Hungarian Third Army, Lieutenant General József Heszlényi, surrendered.\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "2184578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184578", "title": "Prince of Wales Hospital (Sydney)", "text": "Prince of Wales Hospital (Sydney)\n\nThe Prince of Wales Hospital is a 440 bed major public teaching hospital located in Sydney's eastern suburb of Randwick, providing a full range of hospital services to the people of New South Wales, Australia. The hospital has strong ties to the University of New South Wales.\n\nThe Prince of Wales Hospital had its origins in 1852 with the formation of the \"Society for Destitute Children\" which established the \"Asylum for Destitute Children\" with the first building opened on 21 March 1858 in Paddington. After an appeal for funds in 1870, the \"Catherine Hayes Hospital\" opened, reputedly with plans approved by Florence Nightingale. In 1915, during the First World War the hospital was converted by the NSW Government into a military hospital and then a repatriation hospital, and renamed the \"Fourth Australian Repatriation Hospital\". In 1927 an association between the \"Coast Hospital\" and the \"Fourth Australian Repatriation Hospital\" at Randwick began. With the opening of the Concord Repatriation General Hospital in 1953, the hospital was renamed the \"Prince of Wales Hospital\", and operated as an annexe of Sydney Hospital. Restructuring and hospital redevelopment has continued to occur to enhance the medical and patient facilities of the hospital, including amalgamation with the \"Prince Henry Hospital\", \"Royal South Sydney Hospital\" and the \"Eastern Suburbs Hospital\".\n\nOriginally known as the Coast Hospital, Prince Henry had its origins managing patients with infectious diseases such as smallpox (outbreak in 1881), diphtheria, tuberculosis and scarlet fever. In 1900 there was an outbreak of the bubonic plague, with 303 cases reported and 103 deaths, and a further outbreak in 1921. In 1919 the 1918 flu pandemic reached Sydney, requiring the full resources of the hospital.\n\nWithin its grounds was a lazar house for the treatment/quarantining of those with leprosy. During both world wars soldiers with venereal disease were admitted to the hospital.\n\nIn 1934 the Coast Hospital was renamed the \"Prince Henry Hospital of Sydney\" on the occasion of the visit of the Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and major building works commenced to increase the capacity to 1000 beds. With the passing of the \"Prince Henry Hospital Act 1936\", it became a postgraduate teaching hospital. The \"Institute of Epidemiology and Preventative Medicine\" was established in 1946 and was instrumental in investigating the incidence of the Coxsackie virus (aseptic meningitis), poliomyelitis virus and was the first to isolate REO virus.\n\nIn 1970 the management of three hospitals - Prince Henry, Prince of Wales and Eastern Suburbs - was brought under one board. In 2001 Prince Henry's services were relocated to Randwick, where they were absorbed by Prince of Wales.\n\nThe Prince Henry site has since been sold for a housing redevelopment. According to the developer, Landcom, 19 NSW Heritage Registered buildings and features have been preserved. These include the RAF Memorial Clock tower, the wishing well, the water tower and original gates, as well as artisans' cottages and the Pine Cottage and Flowers wards.\n\nMany of those who died at the hospital were buried at the Coast cemetery at Cape Banks.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Sir James Joynton Smith, a hotel, tourism and sports entrepreneur, began a push for a public hospital in South Sydney. At a public meeting at Redfern Town Hall in 1908, Smith was elected provisional president of a future public hospital on the site, which was adjacent to Victoria Park racecourse, which he established and owned. A furious fundraising drive then began.\n\nThe hospital foundation stone was laid on 21 October 1909, with the hospital opening in August 1913. The royal title was conferred in December 1917. The hospital was entirely used to treat influenza patients in the pandemic of 1919. In September 1991 the hospital became part of the Prince Henry, Prince of Wales and Prince of Wales Children's Hospitals Group.\n\nThe \"Eastern Suburbs Hospital\" opened in February 1935 on a site near Queen's Park, after agitation from the community from 1924. During the second World War the hospital was used by the U.S. Navy Authority as a Naval Hospital from 1943 to 1944. In 1968 the hospital board was disbanded and administration of the hospital was taken over by the joint Boards of Directors of The Prince Henry and The Prince of Wales hospitals. The Eastern Suburbs hospital officially closed on 30 June 1980. The former Eastern Suburbs Hospital buildings now form part of Moriah College.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2184581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184581", "title": "History of Markham, Ontario", "text": "History of Markham, Ontario\n\nThe history of Markham, Ontario dates back several millennia. What would become Markham, Ontario was home to First Nations long before European settlement. Seasonal settlements were found from 900 BC to 1650, but traces of these first residence were buried before the area was farmed.\n\nWhat would become western end of Markham was acquired in the Toronto Purchase in 1787 and eastern parts under the Rouge Tract Claim or Gunshot Treaty (Johnson-Butler Purchase) 1788 covering most of Markham, as well as Stouffville and Scarborough.\n\nWhen Upper and Lower Canada were established in 1791, Colonel John Graves Simcoe was appointed the first Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. Simcoe named the township of Markham, north of the town of York (now Toronto), after his friend William Markham, the Archbishop of York.\n\nMarkham Township was originally surveyed in 1793–94, but not until 1801 was the township divided into 10 concession roads (now named as Street, Avenue, Road or Line) running north and south, with six sideroads running east/west (now numbered avenues or named Drive or Road). Many of these concession and sideroads in Markham still exist today. Eventually, the boundaries of Markham occupied the area, as follows:\n\n\nIn 1794, William Berczy led 75 German families from New York State to Markham Township, an area known as German Mills today. Each family was granted 200 acres (0.8 km²). Because of hardships, many returned to York and Niagara and the area became a ghost town. In 1797, because of the revolution in France in 1789, many nobility fled the country and set off for Canada to take advantage of free land grants in Upper Canada. They were totally unprepared for survival under such crude conditions and most of them returned to their homeland.\n\nFrom 1803 to 1812, the largest group of settlers were Pennsylvania Germans, most of whom were Mennonites. These highly skilled craftsmen and knowledgeable farmers had the best chance for survival because they had already survived harsh conditions in Pennsylvania. Prior to 1825 the community is referred to as Reesorville. In 1805 the details of the Toronto Purchase were clarified. From 1830 on, many Irish, Scottish and English emigrated to Upper Canada to escape the famine and overpopulation of their homeland.\n\nMarkham's early years blended the rigours of homesteading with the development of agriculture-based industries. The many rivers and streams in the Township soon supported water-powered saw and grist mills and, later, woollen mills. With improved transportation routes, such as Yonge Street and the growing population, urbanization increased. In 1850 the Township of Markham is create and by 1857 most of the Township had been cleared of timber and was under cultivation. Villages like Thornhill, Unionville and Markham greatly expanded and new, specialized industries such as wagon works, tanneries, farm implement and furniture factories sprang up.\n\nIn 1871, the Toronto and Nipissing Railway Company, with stations in Unionville and Markham, officially opened its line from Scarborough to Uxbridge. Initially, the railway brought renewed prosperity and rapid development. Farmers and millers had a more convenient means of transporting their products to Toronto. Other merchants had easier access to supplies and business boomed.\n\nThe first form of structured municipal government occurred in 1850 when the Township of Markham was created. On November 20, 1872, the Warden of York County signed the By-law of Incorporation, which provided for the election of a Council for the Village of Markham. The Village of Markham grew to a population of 1100 by 1891.\n\nThe increased communication with Toronto brought on by the railway and further enhanced by the development of the telegraph, the telephone and the automobile, ultimately led to the demise of the villages in the Township after the turn of the century. Local industries were simply unable to compete with the larger manufacturers and suppliers of Toronto, and Markham soon reverted to a quiet, rural community.\n\nFollowing World War II, the face of Markham began to change rapidly. It was no longer a community whose inhabitants worked mainly within the area. It evolved into a fast-growing suburb, where the majority of its residents commuted into Toronto. As a result, rural Markham disappeared in the face of tremendous urban growth.\n\nBy 1969, the Township of Markham consisted of several villages, including Markham, Unionville, and parts of Thornhill. In 1971, the Regional Municipality of York was established by the Government of Ontario. Northern portions of Markham Township were annexed to the municipalities of Richmond Hill and Whitchurch-Stouffville (four farm lots south of Main Street Stouffville), while the balance of Markham Township was incorporated in the Town of Markham and the present town boundaries set.\n\nThe boundaries of Markham were altered following the reorganization of York County into York Region. Its present boundaries include begins at the southeastern corner, the boundary stretches northward along the York-Durham Line until approximately one half concession between 19th Avenue and Stouffville Side Road. The boundary continues westward until it reaches highway 404, where it runs in a southerly direction until intersecting Regional Road Seven, (formerly King's Highway 7.) From this point it stretches westward following Langstaff Road until Yonge Street, and travels south until Steeles Avenue East. The Southern border straddles the centre line of Steeles Avenue East until it reaches the city's southeastern corner at the York-Durham Line. All boundaries and concessions are straight lines at slightly more than a right angle to each other, forming a geographical area roughly in the shape of two connected parallelograms.\n\nIn 1976, Markham's population was approximately 56,000. Since that time, the population has more than quadrupled. Explosive growth in new subdivisions has led to a jump in population since the 1980s. Much of Markham's farm land has disappeared, now found well north of 16th Avenue. Concerns from environmentalist and concerns with the future of the Oak Ridges Moraine will impact the extent of growth of the northern portion of Markham.\n\nAt present Markham comprises several distinct communities: Markham Village, Cornell, Unionville, Wismer Commons, Milliken and Thornhill. Since the 1980s the town has been recognized as a suburb of Toronto, though it has an independent economy. Many high-tech industries have located in Markham for the relative abundance of land, low tax rates and good transportation routes. Advanced Micro Devices Canada, IBM Canada, Motorola Canada and many other well-known companies have chosen Markham as their home in Canada. Hence, the town branding itself as Canada's \"High-Tech Capital\". Although with further and more diverse growth, the Town of Markham has become the City of Markham and is now branding itself the \"Diversity Capital of Canada\".\n\nIn 2012, Markham Town Council voted to change its status from town to city.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2184583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184583", "title": "Battle of Debrecen", "text": "Battle of Debrecen\n\nThe Battle of Debrecen, called by the Red Army the \"Debrecen Offensive Operation\", was a battle taking place 6–29 October 1944 on the Eastern Front during World War II. \n\nThe offensive was conducted by the 2nd Ukrainian Front under Marshal Rodion Malinovsky. It was opposed by General Maximilian Fretter-Pico's German Sixth Army (II formation) and the allied Hungarian VII Army Corps of Army Group South Ukraine\n\nThe Axis units were forced to retreat some 160 kilometers, while opposing the 2nd Ukrainian Front which had Debrecen in Hungary as its strategic objective.\n\nOn 23 August 1944, Germany's former ally, Romania had declared war on Germany and its ally Hungary. The subsequent drive of Soviet General Fedor Tolbukhin's 3rd Ukrainian Front into Romania destroyed any semblance of an organised defensive line. On 8 September, Bulgaria, another former German ally, declared war on Germany. By this time, Tolbukhin, aided by the 2nd Ukrainian Front under Malinovsky had destroyed thirteen Axis divisions, taking over 100,000 prisoners. Both Malinovsky and Tolbukhin were promoted to Marshal of the Soviet Union for this on 10 and 12 September respectively. \n\nThese developments had opened up a 650 kilometer gap in Friessner's Army Group. On 24 September 1944, Friessner's Army Group South Ukraine was redesignated Army Group South. General Fretter-Pico's Sixth Army formed the nucleus of Friessner's force, along with the Hungarian Second Army. The German-Hungarian force was designated \"Armeegruppe\" Fretter-Pico. Meanwhile, the Soviet forces were worn down by the Iasi-Chisinau Strategic Offensive Operation and the Belgrade Offensive, and also had to contend with logistical difficulties caused by the different railway gauge used in Romania.\n\nFearing encirclement, commander of Army Group South Ukraine \"Generaloberst\" (Colonel General) Johannes Friessner requested Hitler's permission to withdraw. Hitler refused to authorize it but promised additional forces for Friessner's army group. Hitler ordered Friessner to start a new offensive with the goal of a destruction of two of Malinovsky's Armies, the 27th Army and the 6th Guards Tank Army. In addition, he was ordered to retake two vital passes in the Southern Carpathians. \n\nOn 14 September 1944, Malinovsky, in conjunction with the 3rd Ukrainian Front, launched the Belgrade Offensive. Friessner had been concentrating troops for his own planned offensive, and Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front ran into heavy resistance. After a week of fruitless attacks, Malinovsky called off his offensive and ordered the exhausted 6th Guards Tank Army, along with Cavalry Mechanized Group commanded by Pliyev (7th Mechanized Corps), 4th Guards Cavalry Corps, and 6th Guards Cavalry Corps, with 389 tanks and assault guns, and Cavalry mechanized Group General Major Sergey Gorshkov's 5th Guards Cavalry Corps with the 23rd Tank Corps attached (146 tanks and assault guns), to the area near Oradea.\n\nBy the end of September 1944, both Malinovsky and Friessner had received new orders. Malinovsky was now ordered to attack towards Budapest from the salient to the south around Arad. He was to use the 46th Soviet Army and the 1st Romanian Army, with the Cavalry Mechanized Group Pliyev as the exploitation force in case of a successful breakthrough. The remainder of Malinovsky's forces, including the 6th Guards Tank Army, 53rd Army, and Cavalry mechanized Group Gorshkov, were to attack from the north, near Oradea, towards Debrecen. The plan was for the two spearheads to link up and encircle the German forces. Meanwhile, Friessner's orders included an attack from Oradea with \"Armeegruppe\" Fretter-Pico.\n\nThe 2nd Ukrainian Front operation began on 6 October 1944, with Malinovsky's southern pincer attacking near Arad, and slicing through the Hungarian Third Army. The spearhead of the southern 2nd Ukrainian Front pincer, followed by the Cavalry Mechanized Group Pliyev, had advanced almost sixty kilometres within the first 24 hours.\n\nThe attack by the northern 2nd Ukrainian Front pincer ran into difficulty quickly, colliding with the 1st Panzer Division and 23rd Panzer Divisions of the German III Panzer Corps. By the end of the day, the northern pincer had advanced only ten kilometres.\n\nReacting quickly, Fretter-Pico ordered the 76th Infantry Division into the forward line near Oradea. This freed up the 23rd Panzer Division to move south to counter the breakthrough near Arad. The German Panzer Division Feldherrnhalle 1, refitting at Mezőkövesd, was moved into action to guard potential crossing points on the Tisza River against the advancing 2nd Ukrainian Front units.\n\nBy the evening of 7 October 1944, the 2nd Ukrainian Front southern pincer had advanced further towards the Tisza River. Meanwhile, the northern pincer was still stalled near Oradea. In this area the German-Hungarian forces had managed to halt several flanking attempts by the 6th Guards Tank Army.\n\nBy 10 October, Malinovsky's troops occupied several bridgeheads on the western bank of the Tisza River, and elements of the 46th Army and the 18th Tank Corps were driving on Kecskemét, only 70 kilometres from Budapest. Malinovsky, however, had to redistribute some of these forces to support the advance of Pliyev's group on the other side of the Tisza. The remaining 2nd Ukrainian Front troops of this spearhead were attacked by the Hungarian cavalry and German anti-aircraft troops and forced to retreat to the Tisza on 11 October. The same day, Hungarian (1st Armored and 23rd Infantry Divisions) counter-attacks against the 2nd Ukrainian Front's 243rd Rifle Division at the Mindszent bridgehead became so dire that the Romanian VII Corps was rushed to Mindszent to reinforce the bridgehead's defense.\n\nSubsequently, the Romanian 2nd and 4th Infantry Divisions took over 2nd Ukrainian Front bridgeheads on the Tisza below Szolnok. The bridgehead of the 4th Division was attacked on 19 October by the Hungarian 1st Cavalry and 1st Infantry Divisions, which the 4th Division held back until hit on the right flank by the German 24th Panzer Division, 4th SS Panzergrenadier Division, and the 503rd Heavy Tank Battalion. The right flank of the Romanian 4th Division caved in and the German armor drove behind the division, cutting it off from the Tisza River and eventually forcing its surrender by 20 October. On 25 October, three Hungarian divisions (1st Cavalry, 1st Infantry and 20th Infantry) attacked the Romanian 2nd Division in its bridgehead. The Romanian 2nd Division panicked and pulled back across the Tisza River. This Hungarian success, however, was not repeated when a third assault was made during 26–29 October against the Romanian 19th Infantry Division's bridgehead at Alpar.\n\nOn 8 October 1944, Cavalry Mechanized Group Pliyev shifted its attack northeastward. Pliyev's group advanced quickly along the major highway between Szolnok to Debrecen. At Hajdúszoboszló, the group's lead units, the 9th Guards Mechanized and the 6th Guards Cavalry Corps, ran into elements of 23rd Panzer Division moving south to halt the southern pincer. On 9 October 1944, with support from the 5th Air Army, Pliyev's group took the town. The Germans fell back to Debrecen, and began entrenching to the southeast of the city.\n\nOn 11 October 1944, elements of Pliyev's 4th Guards Cavalry Corps reached the outskirts of Debrecen. Although this corps was cut off from the main Soviet force, Pliyev had managed to avoid encirclement. Under the 6th Guards Tank Army's attacks, the front line near Oradea was steadily pushed back, in what historian Earl F. Ziemke described as \"one of the wildest tank battles of the war\". By 12 October, Pliyev's group had already lost some 200 armored fighting vehicles. By 14 October 1944, the line had fallen back 14 kilometers, with Oradea occupied by Malinovsky's forces. Further to the north, a new crisis threatened Fretter-Pico. The 4th Ukrainian Front had finally attacked, falling on Otto Wöhler's German Eighth Army. \n\nMalinovsky now linked up with Cavalry Mechanized Group Pliyev. Forcing their way through the Axis resistance, during 19–20 October three Romanian divisions (2nd and 3rd Mountain, plus the \"Tudor Vladimirescu Division\") assaulted and seized Debrecen as part of Soviet 27th Army's assault on the right flank of the 6th Guards Tank Army. On 22 October 1944, Pliyev's group captured Nyíregyháza. The line of communications of Wöhler's Eighth Army was severed. German Colonel-General Friessner had ordered Wöhler to disengage and fall back northwest of Nyíregyháza and attempt to form a defensive line. This move was already in progress when Cavalry Mechanized Group Pliyev cut Wöhler's lines of communications.\n\nTo address the developing threat, the German 23rd and 1st Panzer Divisions, led by the Tiger IIs of the 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion attacked to the east. Paul Klatt's 3rd Mountain Division, the 15th Infantry Division, and the 8th SS Cavalry Division \"Florian Geyer\" formed the forces attacking to the west. On 24 October 1944, forces of the 23rd Panzer Division reached Nagykálló, which was already occupied by the German 3rd Mountain Division.\n\nOn 26 October, the 23rd Panzer Division recaptured Nyíregyháza. Wöhler began moving his Eighth Army out through the escape route created through Nyíregyháza. By the 28th, Wöhler's army had escaped encirclement. By this time, Pliyev's forces destroyed most of their vehicles and heavy weapons and marched south to reach the Soviet lines. Despite the attempted destruction by German forces, Pliyev's Cavalry-Mechanized Group was back in action by 10 November during the Soviet drive to Szeged.\n\nThree corps of Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front had sustained significant losses in the fighting and the intended rapid 2nd Ukrainian Front assault on Budapest had been delayed. The Nyíregyháza counter-attack was the last time that German forces were to defeat a full-strength Red Army force on even terms. By pinching off the breakthrough exploitation group of the 2nd Ukrainian Front offensive, the Germans were able to re-establish a stable front line position, and thus, prevent the 2nd Ukrainian Front's advance from becoming a catastrophe for Wöhler. The German success, was however short-lived as Nyíregyháza was captured by the Red Army on 30 October, and another powerful Red Army offensive opened to the south with Budapest again being its objective, with the Soviets reaching the area of the Hungarian capital on 7 November 1944. The city of Debrecen fell on 20 October after two Romanian divisions, the first Romanian infantry division and the ``Tudor Vladimirescu`` division captured the city despite numerous German and Hungarian counter-attacks to stop their advance. As a result of their victory, the Romanian ``Tudor Vladimirescu`` division was renamed on Stalin`s request the ``Tudor Vladimirescu - Debrecen`` division.\n\nThe Debrecen operation saw the forces of the 2nd Ukrainian Front advance anywhere from 60 to 120 miles further west into Hungary, leaving the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts in position to renew the offensive towards Budapest. The tank battle at Debrecen itself had drawn the German Panzer units away from defending the approaches to Budapest. Finally, the Red Army thrust occupied the eastern third of Hungary, clearing the obstacle of the Transylvanian Alps and denying their use as a winter defense position for the Axis forces.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2184593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184593", "title": "Chrysler R platform", "text": "Chrysler R platform\n\nThe Chrysler R platform was introduced for the 1979 model year as an attempt to compete with General Motors' downsized standard line (introduced 1977) and the new Ford Panther series. It comprised six models and lasted just three years.\n\nAs the middle of the 1970s approached, Chrysler was facing an increasingly worrisome organizational and financial situation due to a combination of internal and external factors. The company had suffered the embarrassment of releasing new, bulkier full-sized C-body models for 1974 which promptly flopped due to the 1973 OPEC oil embargo, and unable to fix the mounting difficulties beyond unsuccessful sales incentives, chairman Lynn Townsend took early retirement and left the reins to John Ricardo. By 1976, Chrysler had exhausted its cash reserves and had to pay for all operating costs with purely sales revenue. Ricardo attempted to seek a bailout from the Federal government to the tune of $7.5 billion, but President Jimmy Carter immediately turned him down.\n\nThen in 1977, GM released new, radically downsized standard cars which were nearly shorter and lighter by almost 700 pounds. The Chevrolet Caprice won Motor Trend Magazine's \"Car Of The Year Award\" and quickly became the best-selling car in America. Lacking the resources for a similar undertaking (GM had spent $600 million on the project), Chrysler was forced to respond in a more modest way.\n\nThe full-sized C-body Dodge and Plymouth lines were dropped for 1978, in part because they were finding few customers outside the fleet market (the C-body Chryslers lasted one more year). At this point, the mid-sized B-body Monaco and Fury were left as Chrysler's largest cars, but an outdated design that could not compete with GM and also by that point were more popular with police departments than private buyers.\n\nDuring this time, the R-body project commenced which essentially amounted to taking the same old B-body platform that had its origins in the \"downsized\" standard Plymouths and Dodges of 1962 and grafting a new, more modern body onto them to create an ersatz challenger to the Chevrolet Caprice. There was considerable dispute over the cars' final appearance. GM had not only made its downsized big cars smaller, but styled them to look less ponderous. However, in the end, it was decided to retain a heavier \"big car\" look on the R-bodies with blocky, imposing lines. A variety of engineering measures were employed to the old warhorse B-body platform to reduce weight, improve reliability, and modernize components. Big-block engines vanished, and power trains now comprised the 225-cid Slant Six, 318 cid V8, and 360 cid V8 (unavailable in California because of emissions regulations) mated to the 3-speed Torqueflite automatic transmission. This done, Chrysler retired the B-body Dodge Monaco and Plymouth Fury along with the C-body Chrysler Newport and New Yorker at the close of the 1978 model year.\n\nHowever, the company was still facing a dire financial situation and it was obvious that new blood was needed, especially as President Carter had written off Chrysler's management as incompetent and made it clear that no federal bailout would happen so long as the status quo were maintained. Thus, Lee Iacocca was hired as company president in July 1978 three months after his expulsion from Ford. John Ricardo held onto his position as chairman for another year, but his presence merely stood in the way of the hoped-for federal bailout, thus he summarily resigned in early 1979 with Iacocca assuming his position. By the summer of 1980 Chrysler Corporation through ardent negotiations with Congress secured a $1.5 billion loan guarantee, which allowed the company to put into production the K-Car line and intensify development of the Minivan line of vehicles.\n\nBilled as \"pillared hardtops\", all R-body vehicles were available as four-door sedans only. No coupe, convertible, or station wagon was offered; Chrysler could not afford to develop these additional body styles. Most R-body models were built at the Lynch Road Plant in Detroit.\n\nThe 17-year-old platform that the R-bodies used was hidden by the design and engineering changes mentioned above, although the cars ended up being three inches (76 mm) longer than the B-body Dodge Monaco and Plymouth Fury. Initial sales started off strong, and proceeded that way for most of the 1979 model year, with just over 121,000 produced and sold. However, in the spring of 1979, the Iranian Revolution was in full swing. Gas prices rose sharply, and the US economy plunged into a deep recession that would last for the next three years. Sales of the R-bodies sank abruptly for the 1980 and 1981 model years, and never recovered. The line was initially planned to be dropped after the 1980 model year, but strong protest from the fleet community (especially police departments) gave the R-body line a short reprieve for 1981.\n\nInitially, there was no Plymouth version of the R-body as company production manager Eugene Cafiero decided to pull the plug on all Plymouths larger than the Volare. This decision had apparently sound reasoning in that it reduced expenses at a time when Chrysler could ill-afford to waste money and because sales of the B- and C-body Plymouths had been rather minuscule outside the fleet market. However, Plymouth dealers objected to this since they had no entry in the fleet market now. Substituting for Plymouth was a stripped Chrysler Newport offered for the police market, which ended up proving quite popular with law enforcement agencies. Chrysler bowed to pressure and brought back an R-body Plymouth Fury for the 1980 model year.\n\nThe R-bodies proved quite popular with police departments, who especially appreciated the cars handling, and the attention paid to interior space and comfort. Mechanical reliability was also significantly better than the B-body Dodges and Plymouths, which suffered an alarming drop in quality control starting in 1976. On the other hand, big-block engines were gone and the 195 hp 360 V8 was now the standard power plant for Chrysler's police pursuit package. The E58 code police spec 360 V8; equipped with a four-barrel carburetor, dual exhausts, and a mild camshaft, could propel the cars to 120 mph (actual police testing yielded for the St Regis), which was respectable if somewhat less than 440 V8-equipped B-bodies which had been able to attain .\n\nAs noted above, California's stricter emissions requirements ruled out the sale of 360 V8-equipped vehicles, and no exception was made for law enforcement agencies, which were forced to use the inadequate 318 V8, even though it was equipped with a 4-barrel carburator. A fully loaded Dodge St. Regis pursuit car with this engine struggled to reach and proved nearly useless except for police vehicles used in city areas. But after the R-body line was dropped in 1982 and Chrysler switched over to the smaller M-body Dodge Diplomat for police use, the 318 V8 proved sufficient.\n"}
{"id": "2184604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184604", "title": "Arab Bank", "text": "Arab Bank\n\nArab Bank is one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East, founded in 1930 in Jerusalem, Mandatory Palestine, as the first private sector financial institution in the Arab world. Headquartered today in Amman, Jordan, it serves clients in more than 600 branches spanning five continents. Arab Bank is a publicly held shareholding company listed on the Amman Stock Exchange.\n\nThe bank is a major economic engine in Jordan and throughout the Middle East and North Africa region, providing banking services and capital, and facilitating development and trade throughout the region. According to its website, the bank is the highest-ranked by market capitalization, and represents approximately 25% of the Amman Stock Exchange.\n\nU.S. appellate courts have ruled in the Bank’s favor in several lawsuits filed in the 2000s alleging its involvement in facilitating the funding of terrorist organizations.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, the bank grew to 43 branches and had JOD 5.5 million capital. During the 1960s, the bank focused on investments and became a catalyst for Arab economic developments when most other financial institutions avoided the risk.\n\nDuring the nationalization wave of the 1960s, Arab Bank lost a total of 25 branches. Following the Six-Day War in 1967, the bank closed its West Bank and Gaza branches. Although it closed branches in the Middle East, the bank continued to expand in other parts of the world. In 1961, the bank opened its first international location, becoming the first Arab financial institution to establish a presence in Switzerland. By 1964 Arab Bank Switzerland had locations in both Zürich and Geneva.\n\nIn 1974, after his father's death, Abd Al-Majeed Shoman was named Chairman and General Manager of Arab Bank. Under his leadership, the bank expanded its scope of products and services into new areas of business. Though it previously emphasized trade and small-scale construction finance, the bank undertook a leading role in large-scale project finance, both directly and through participation in syndicated loans. By the 1990s, the bank added investment banking to its services. In the mid-1990s, the bank was given permission by the Central Bank of Jordan and the Israeli Central Bank to reopen in the West Bank/Gaza under the supervision of both the CBJ and the Palestinian Monetary Authority.\n\nIn May 2000, Abd Al Majeed's son Abdel Hamid became CEO. Under his leadership, Arab Bank reopened operations in Syria in 2005, and took steps to commence its activities in Iraq, circumstances permitting. In January 2007, Arab Bank established Europe Arab Bank (EAB), a London-based, fully owned subsidiary. It also acquired 50% of MNG Bank in Turkey (now known as Turkland Bank) and 50% of Al Nisr Al Arabi Insurance company in Jordan, thus introducing bancassurance to its product variety. Also, the group established Arab Bank-Syria. In 2008, Arab Bank partnered with VASCO Data Security International, Inc., now OneSpan, to work on the bank's authentication technology.\n\nOver the next few years, the bank opened branches in Frankfurt, London, Australia, New York and Singapore. Following the Oslo Peace Accords between Israel and Palestine, at the invitation of Israel, Arab Bank opened branches in several Palestinian towns with broad governmental support.\n\nToday, Arab Bank provides consumer banking services, as well as corporate and institutional banking services to individuals, corporations, government agencies and other international financial institutions.\n\nAfter years of being ranked A− from Fitch, A− from Standard & Poor, and A3 from Moody’s, the bank's rankings were dropped twice in 2011. Moody's first downgraded its Local Currency Deposit Rating to Baa1, and then downgraded the bank's Financial Strength Rating to a C− from a C. In both instances, Moody's noted the decision was based on an analysis of political instability in the region. In April 2012, Moody's announced a possible downgrade of the Bank's current Financial Strength Rating as well as its local currency long- and short-term deposit ratings. In November 2011, Standard & Poor's lowered its long-term counterparty credit ratings to 'BB' from 'BB+', noting the ratings are constrained by the local currency ratings on the sovereign. As of 25 January 2012, Fitch still had Arab Bank ranked at an A-.\n\nAs the only Jordanian organization ranked among the top 10 organizations in the Arab world, Arab Bank has shown great progress in its ESG performance throughout the years. During 2014, the Bank was ranked at the fifth level and was able to move up to the fourth level during 2015, with a total weight of 2.78%.\n\nIn 2006, the bank participated at the International Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Financing Terrorism Conference hosted by the Union of Arab Banks and supported by the United States Department of the Treasury. The conference sought to unite the public and private sector in strengthening defenses against terrorist financing and money laundering in the MENA region.\n\nSince 2006, the bank has held a regulatory compliance summit with speakers from across the international banking community to discuss and learn more about the compliance environment. In 2008, at the request of the Association of Banks, Arab Bank hosted a compliance workshop attended by compliance professionals from banks throughout the country including the Central Bank of Jordan. \n\n\nIn 1978, Arab Bank created the Abd Al-Hameed Shoman Foundation to promote social development in the Arab world in the fields of science and the humanities. It is one of the only foundations created by a private sector company in Jordan. The Foundation organizes the Abd Al Hameed Shoman Cultural Forum which brings together leading scientists, educators and innovators of thoughtful discussion on today’s cultural issues. In 2011, Arab Bank committed approximately 87% of its annual budget for community investment through the foundation.\n\nIn 2011, the Bank donated over 8 million Jordanian dinars to its Abd Al-Hameed Shoman Foundation to support scientific research and studies in the humanities in Jordan and the Middle East. In late 2009, Arab Bank launched 'Together', a corporate social responsibility program that links four non-profits dedicated to poverty alleviation, education, health and environmental protection. In 2011, Arab Bank donated more than 177,000 Jordanian dinars to the Together Program. In March 2011, Arab Bank Chairman Abdel Hamid Shoman announced the Bank would be partnering with the private sector and allocating one million Jordanian Dinars for development projects to help fight against poverty and unemployment in Jordan.\n\nSeveral civil lawsuits were filed against the Bank in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn under the Anti-Terrorism Act and Alien Tort Statute in 2004, all of which resulted in decisions in favor of the Bank. In these cases, U.S. and non-U.S. plaintiffs alleged they or their family members were harmed by acts of terrorism that occurred in Israel or the West Bank/Gaza from 1995 to 2005. They alleged that the Bank held accounts for individuals and organizations that, in turn, supported terrorist activities. Similar cases were brought against UBS, Credit Lyonnais, Bank of China, American Express Bank LTD, National Westminster Bank, PLC and Commerzbank AG.\n\nOn 9 February 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned a liability verdict in the case of \"Linde v. Arab Bank Plc\" in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). The verdict overturned from 22 September 2014 after 30 days of trial and two days of jury deliberation, found the Bank liable for knowingly supporting terrorism relating to 24 different terrorist acts. The Second Circuit found that the District Court erred in failing to provide the jury with adequate instructions during the court proceedings.\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York dismissed \"Jesner v. Arab Bank,\" a case filed by 6,000 foreign citizens injured in Israel during the Second Intifada under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), ruling that corporations are not proper defendants in ATS suits. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unanimously affirmed this dismissal in December 2015. In April 2017, the Supreme Court of the United States granted the plaintiffs' petition to hear the case. Oral arguments before the Supreme Court were held in October 2017, and on 24 April 2018, the Court affirmed the dismissal of all claims against the Bank, finding that foreign corporations are not proper defendants in cases brought under the ATS.\n\nOn 6 November 2012, a U.S. judge dismissed a civil litigation action brought by Israeli resident Mati Gill under the Anti-Terrorism Act for injuries he sustained in an alleged terrorist attack in Israel in 2008.\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network assessed a $24 million penalty against the New York Branch of Arab Bank for failing to implement an adequate anti-money laundering program to manage the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing, and violating the suspicious activity reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act. On October 1, 2018, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency terminated this consent order.\n\nOn 26 February 2004 the Israel Defense Forces confiscated funds from Arab Bank's and Cairo-Amman Bank's Ramallah branch in connection with an investigation into whether certain account holders were supporting terrorism. In September 2009, the IDF issued a letter to Arab Bank stating that it had no evidence that the Bank or any of its directors or employees were involved in or funded terrorist activities.\n\n\n"}

Usually, a white ring surrounds the eye. It has a fine, soft coat which varies in colour from light brown to reddish to sandy grey. Unusually among mammals, the female is larger than the male, an example of sexual dimorphism.\n\nIt inhabits macchia-type vegetation, grassland, bushveld, the Sahara Desert and semi-desert areas. It is also common in parts of the Ethiopian highlands, such as Degua Tembien.\n\nThe Cape hare is a nocturnal herbivore, feeding on grass and various shrubs. Coprophagy, the consumption of an organism's own fecal material to double the amount of time food spends in the digestive tract, is a common behaviour amongst rabbits and hares. This habit allows the animal to extract the maximum nourishment from its diet, and microbes present in the pellets also provide nutrients.\n\nLike other hares, they run fast. The only predator which is capable of outrunning them is the cheetah. All other predators are ambush and/or opportunistic hunters; examples of these are leopards, caracals, and black-backed jackals.\n\nAfter a 42-day-long pregnancy, the female gives birth to from one to three young, termed leverets, per litter and may have as many as 4 litters per year. A characteristic of hares which differentiates them from rabbits is that the young are born precocial; that is, the young are born with eyes open and are able to move about shortly after birth. The Cape hare is no exception in this regard.\n\nCurrently, 12 subspecies are recognised:\n"}

He is best known as the singer and guitarist for the rock band Rocket from the Crypt, which he formed and fronted (as Speedo) for the entirety of its career from 1990 to 2005. Prior to this he was the guitarist in the post-hardcore band Pitchfork, and also played in Drive Like Jehu during the early 1990s. In 1999 he formed the Hot Snakes, and in 2000 also formed the Sultans, in which (as Slasher) he sang and originally played bass before switching to rhythm guitar. He played in both these bands until their breakups in 2005 and 2007 respectively. He also released a solo recording under the name Back Off Cupids, which was recorded in 1994 but not released until 1999. Over the years he has performed in many other musical acts including Conservative Itch, Stacatto Reads, Custom Floor, and Beehive & the Barracudas. He is the owner of Swami Records, a label he founded in 1999 (he uses the title The Swami in this capacity). He frequently works with bands in a studio capacity and releases albums by many southern California groups through his label. He also hosts the \"Swami Sound System\" program (previously on San Diego radio station 94.9 (KBZT), and now available on Slacker Radio). Reis remains an influential figure in the San Diego underground music community and is currently performing with a new band named The Night Marchers.\n\nReis was born in 1969 in the Ocean Beach area of San Diego to Portuguese American heritage.\n\nReis is married, and he and his wife had their first child in 2006.\n\nReis became involved in music in 1984, playing in a punk rock band called Conservative Itch at age 15. In 1986 he formed the post-hardcore group Pitchfork with friend Rick Froberg, in which he played until the group's dissolution in 1990. Following this he formed two new bands: Drive Like Jehu included Froberg and was the more experimental, exploring styles such as post-punk, post-hardcore, math rock, and early-1990s emo. Rocket from the Crypt, meanwhile, was envisioned as a more back-to-basics rock band and involved other San Diego-area musicians. Both groups released debut albums in 1991 through local labels Cargo Records and Headhunter Records. Rocket from the Crypt was soon re-invented as a punk-inspired rock & roll band with a horn section, developing a reputation for creative and energetic live shows. The group released many vinyl singles and put out their second album \"\" in 1992. Reis' heavy involvement with Rocket from the Crypt sidelined Drive Like Jehu at this time, but both groups were soon signed to major label Interscope Records as a pair.\n\nIn 1994 Rocket from the Crypt took a six-month break while Reis returned to work with Drive Like Jehu, recording the critically acclaimed album \"Yank Crime\". At this time he also recorded an album's worth of solo material under the project name Back Off Cupids, but the majority of this work went unreleased until 1999. In 1995, with little fanfare, Drive Like Jehu disbanded and Reis resumed working with Rocket from the Crypt full time. The group experienced a flurry of creativity that resulted in a trilogy of releases that year, culminating in the acclaimed album \"Scream, Dracula, Scream!\" They became well-known in the alternative music community, filmed several music videos, toured internationally, and experienced a surge of popularity in the United Kingdom. They released a follow-up entitled \"RFTC\" in 1998, but Interscope turned their attention to higher-grossing acts and soon the band left the label. This was followed by the departure of longtime drummer Adam Willard from the group in early 2000, resulting in a hiatus of sorts during which Reis explored other musical endeavors.\n\nIn 1999 Reis started the record label Swami Records, primarily as a means of releasing music by a number of San Diego-area bands including several he was involved with. He also formed two new bands: Sessions with drummer Jason Kourkounis resulted in the formation of Hot Snakes (which also reunited Reis with Rick Froberg), while collaborations with drummer Tony Di Prima led to the formation of the Sultans. Both bands essentially explored stripped-down versions of the musical formulas Reis had established in Rocket from the Crypt, with Hot Snakes incorporating some of the more experimental elements of Drive Like Jehu while the Sultans used a more straightforward rock & roll approach. During this time Reis recorded and acted as producer for a number of groups, including Superchunk, Selby Tigers, GoGoGo Airheart, and the Red Onions. He also performed on and off with other bands including Stacatto Reads, Custom Floor, and Beehive and the Barracudas.\n\nRocket from the Crypt regrouped in 2000, signing to Vagrant Records and bringing in new drummer Mario Rubalcaba. Reis continued to record and perform with Rocket from the Crypt, Hot Snakes, and the Sultans for the next several years, dividing his time between all three groups. Between 1999 and 2005 he recorded 2 albums with Rocket from the Crypt, 2 with the Sultans, and 3 with Hot Snakes. In 2003 his younger brother Dean Reis joined him in the Sultans. Rubalcaba also became a member of all three of Reis' bands, replacing Kourkounis in Hot Snakes in 2004 and Di Prima in the Sultans in 2006.\n2005 marked the end of Reis' multi-band involvement, with the breakups of Hot Snakes in July and Rocket from the Crypt on Halloween. He then focused his attention on Swami Records, putting out numerous releases that Fall and Winter and organizing tours in support of the label. He began hosting the \"Swami Sound System\" program on San Diego radio station 94.9 (KBZT) and continued to play with the Sultans occasionally until their disbanding in January 2007.\n\nReis continues to operate Swami Records and acts as a producer and occasional studio musician for various artists and releases on the label, while focusing on his new role as a father. He constructed his own recording studio and opened a bar called The Bar Pink Elephant (later renamed Bar Pink) in San Diego's North Park district. In 2007 he announced a new musical project, and began recording and writing new songs with former Hot Snakes members Gar Wood and Jason Kourkounis and CPC Gangbangs bassist Tommy Kitsos. Reis described the new group as \"a combonation [sic] of everything I've been a part of dating back to my prepubescent days in Pitchfork. Similar to Hot Snakes but not as sinister yet still maintaining some of the drama and subsonic boom. Akin to the rockin' fun of RFTC but without the same kind of riffery. Like the Sultans but not as straightforward yet still maintaining the sense of melody and pop of the 2nd record.\" Dubbed The Night Marchers, the new group began performing and touring in 2008 with Reis again using the stage name \"Speedo\". Their debut album \"See You in Magic\" was released on April 22, 2008.\n\nReis continues to host the \"Swami Sound System\" program on San Diego radio station 94.9 on Saturday nights and is preparing several releases of rare and previously unreleased Rocket from the Crypt material. He also plays a recurring role on the television show \"Yo Gabba Gabba\" as \"The Music Swami\", introducing each episode's musical guest.\n\nIn 2011 Hot Snakes announced they will be reforming for tours the US and Europe.\n\nIn 2015, Reis produced American rock band Ceremony's fifth studio album, \"The L-Shaped Man\".\n\nMany artists have cited John Reis as an influence or have expressed admiration for his work, including Jim Adkins of Jimmy Eat World, Kurt Ballou of Converge, Laurent Barnard of Gallows and Steven Andrew Miller of Unbroken.\n\nThis section lists albums and EPs on which Reis has performed.

It premiered on NBC on May 16, 1977.\n\nAfter the climatic ending in the first movie, Alexander Duncan (McCloskey), is taken to a hospital where he is being operated on. He has flashbacks of his life, showing how he came to Hollywood as an inexperienced young man from rural Oklahoma.\n\nHe spends most of his time drawing instead of being a farmhand to his father, this causes his father to basically throw Alex out of the home; his reasoning being that as the oldest Alex needs to become a man and make it on his own now, and with six other people to feed, they just can't afford for Alex to be another extra mouth. His father is firm on this, and his mother is not able to change the decision. Alex packs a small bag and with whatever money he has, buys a bus ticket to Hollywood, California.\n\nAt the bus depot, a streetwise hustler named Buddy befriends him. Buddy takes Alex back to his apartment and lets him stay there for the night. The next day, Alex tries to find a job, but because of California's strict labor laws, he doesn't have any luck because he is still a minor. Alex sees male prostitutes hustling on the streets as a means of income, and becomes disheartened when he returns to Buddy's apartment and sees an older man walking out the door. Buddy gives him a realistic talk about survival, and convinces Alex to go to a client of his to make an easy $50.\n\nAlex's flashbacks ends and he is in the present day. He awakens in the hospital to Dawn, and they reaffirm their love to each other. Dawn helps Alex as much as she can after he's discharged from the hospital and still recovering. Both are no longer hustling, and without money, Alex convinces Dawn to go back home to her small Arizona town to wait for him to come get her. He takes her to the bus depot to see her off, promising her that he'll come get her when he earns enough money.\n\nHe loses the job that Umber got him in the first movie as a stock boy in a department store because of his involvement with Swan, and is unable to get another legit job afterwards because of his previous prostitution recognition. He calls home and speaks with his mother, telling her he wants to come home, but his mother says no. Alex is desperate and frustrated, and resorts back to prostitution, getting picked up by an undercover police officer immediately.\n\nAt the police station while he's getting booked, he asks to contact Donald Umber, and is overheard by a psychologist named Ray Church. Alex gets released on Ray signing for him, vouching for his guaranteed court appearance. Ray tells Alex that Umber is no longer around town, but that he's a good friend of his, and asks Alex how he knows him. Alex says that Umber helped him and Dawn before. Ray takes Alex to a youth house for gay men, but Alex feels uncomfortable because he is not gay, and he leaves immediately after he gets there.\n\nReturning to his apartment, the landlady tells him the rent is way overdue, and the mural that he had painted on one side of the wall is being covered over with a coat of fresh wall paint. In Arizona, Dawn isn't adjusting well to being back home, and longs to be with Alex again. While on his way to the post office, Buddy sees him on the streets and catches up with him. He convinces Alex to go on a double date with him and one of his clients and her friend.\n\nThey go to a nice restaurant and Buddy lends Alex a nice suit to wear. They enjoy good food and wine, and Alex opens up to his older date about Dawn. He begins to enjoy himself, and he starts to genuinely like his date, going back to her home for the night. In the morning she gives him cab money, and he gets upset that she viewed their night together as a transaction. He does not take her cab money, and finds out that she has a husband as well as paid Buddy for their date. Alex goes to Buddy's apartment and confronts him about it; he leaves Buddy's apartment for the second time after feeling disgusted with the whole situation. Since he's been evicted, and not wanting to stay at Buddy's, he ends up sleeping outside underneath a public playground.\n\nThe next day, he is loitering at an art museum and is noticed by a man named Charles Selby, who is a professional football player. Selby is a closeted gay, and he entices Alex with his lavish lifestyle, employing Alex as his current boy-toy. He's making good money under Selby's employment and companionship, but Selby is not naive to Alex's true intentions and feelings.\n\nSelby and Alex run into Ray at a nightclub, and Ray reminds him of his court appearance. At court, Alex gets lucky and goes before a compassionate judge who dismisses his charges with a warning not to appear before her in court again. Ray also gives Alex some advice, stating that Selby is smart enough to realize that Alex is just using him, and that he should be prepared for when Selby replaces him.\n\nWhen Alex goes back to Selby's home from court, he sees that Ray's warning has come true. Selby is enticing a new boy-toy with the same surfer posing photographs that he did with Alex. At a party that Selby is hosting, the realization that Selby is getting tired of Alex becomes more prominent. Ray tells Alex that he needs to start thinking about his own life; that he has no cause to be bothered by the new surfer boy because Alex was just hustling Selby anyway. He also states that whatever Selby might be as a closeted gay, he's not a hustler.\n\nAfter dropping off Ray, Alex goes on a drug pickup for Selby, but the whole party gets caught when two stakeout detectives follows Alex back to Selby's. In Arizona, while buying a shirt for Alex, a man recognizes Dawn as a prostitute in Hollywood. Dawn runs out of the store mortified. In court, Alex tells the judge that he just wants to leave and get out of that town forever; the same judge that dismissed his charges the first time, is sympathetic to him again, and dismisses his charges again.\n\nRay drops Alex off at the bus depot, where he's bought a ticket to Arizona to get Dawn. As he's on the bus, he sees Dawn in the streets. He gets off of his bus and runs up to Dawn, telling her that he was on the bus coming to get her, and she should have waited for him at home. She told him about the incident at the store with being recognized by a former john, and that she just couldn't wait anymore.\n\nThe movie ends with Alex telling Dawn that they're going to a new place and will try their luck there. As they head back to the bus depot to decide where they want to go, they see a fresh new kid walking out of the depot down Hollywood Blvd. for the first time. They both look at the young kid, knowing the hardships he'll be faced with.\n\n\n\"Alexander\" was the last appearance by actress Jean Hagen, who died August 29, 1977.\n\nPhil Hall of \"Film Threat\" called it \"not a great film\" but \"a breakthrough, of sorts, in LGBT television.\"\n"}

The Carpathians are a \"subsystem\" of a bigger Alps-Himalaya System that stretches from the western Europe all the way to southern Asia, and are further divided into \"provinces\" and \"subprovinces\". The last level of the division, i.e. the actual mountain ranges and basins, is usually classified as \"units\". The main divisions are shown in the map on the right. \n\nTo generalize, there are three major provinces (regions): Western Carpathians, Eastern Carpathians, and Southern Carpathians.\n\nThe division is largely (with many exceptions) undisputed at the lowest level (except for the Ukrainian part), but various divisions are given for the higher levels, especially for the penultimate level. A geomorphological division has been used as much as the data was available; other new physiogeographic divisions were used in other cases. Where the classification of a higher level \"title\" is known/sure, it is added at the end of the name in brackets, e.g. \"(subprovince)\".\n\nThe names are also given in the language of the corresponding country and marked by the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes:\n\nThe most confusing and diverse is the classification of the Beskids, including the Western Beskids, the Central Beskids and the Eastern Beskids. Their geologic features are fairly distinct, but multiple traditions, languages and nationalities have developed overlapping variants for the divisions and names of these ranges. \n\nIn Romania, it is usual to divide the Eastern Carpathians in Romanian territory into three formal groups (northern, central, southern), instead in \"Outer\" and \"Inner\" sections of Eastern Carpathians. The Romanian approach is shown by adding the following abbreviations to the names of units within Romania:\n\n\nSimilar standard (grouping of \"outer\" and \"inner\" sections) is traditionally applied within broader use of the term \"Wooded Carpathians\", that encompasses all mountain ranges within central section of \"Outer Eastern Carpathians\", including \"Eastern Beskids\" with \"Polonynian Mountains\", and also all mountains within northern section of \"Inner Eastern Carpathians\", including \"Vihorlat-Gutin Area\" and \"Maramureș-Rodna Area\".\n\nThe Transylvanian Plateau is encircled by, and geologically a part of, the Carpathians. But it is not a mountainous region and its inclusion is disputed in some sources. Its features are included below. \n\nThe Serbian Carpathians are sometimes considered part of the Southern Carpathians (together with the Banat Mountains), sometimes not considered part of the Carpathians at all. They're included below. \n\nThe Outer Carpathian Depressions lay outside the broad arc of the entire formation and are usually listed as part of the individual divisions of the Carpathian Mountains, i.e. of Western Carpathians, Eastern Carpathians etc. With the difficulty of finding their exact subdivisions, they are given only as a list of the final units (\"mountains\" etc.) from the west to the east and south, in a separate listing at the end.\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern section of the Western Beskids\n\nNorthern section of the Western Beskids\n\nEastern section of the Western Beskids (in Slovak terminology: \"Eastern Beskids\", SK: \"Východné Beskydy\")\n\nCentral section of the Western Beskids (in Slovak terminology: \"Central Beskids\", SK: \"Stredné Beskydy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClarification: In Ukraine sometimes is denoted as \"Eastern Carpathians\" only the part basically on their territory (i.e.to the north of the Prislop Pass), while in Romania sometimes use to call \"Eastern Carpathians\" (\"Carpații Orientali\") only the other part, which lies on their territory (i.e. from the Ukrainian border or from the Prislop Pass to the south). In some Polish classifications, Central Beskids and Central Beskidian Piedmont belongs to Western Carpathians province and Outer Western Carpathians subprovince.\n\n\n\nWooded Beskids (PL: Beskidy Lesiste; UA: Лісисті Бескиди):\n\nPolonynian Beskids (PL: Beskidy Połonińskie; UA: Полонинські Бескиди; SK: Poloniny):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Criș Mountains (Munții Criș)\" :\n\n\"Seș-Meseș Mountains (Munții Seș-Meseșului)\":\n\n\"Bihor Massif (\"Masivul Bihor\"):\n\n\"Mureș Mountains (\"Munții Mureșului\"):\n\n\n\n\n\"Transylvanian Plateau (\"Podișul Transilvaniei\"):\n\n\nThe Outer Subcarpathian regions are divided into Western, Northern etc. and are usually treated as part of the individual parts of the Carpathian Mountains, i.e. of Western Carpathians, Eastern Carpathians etc..

Originally airing on October 11, 1977, with a rebroadcast on June 5, 1978 (which saw CBS move the show to Mondays at 9 p.m.), it was written and directed by Alan Alda.\n\nHawkeye and B.J. are surprised to find Sidney Freedman among the latest batch of incoming casualties. He had gone to the front lines to check up on Tom, a soldier who had previously been sent to the 4077th after being wounded. Sidney had counseled him and returned him to duty, but both of them were hit in an artillery barrage during his visit.\n\nThe whole camp is on edge due to a series of petty squabbles, so Colonel Potter offers to discreetly send some of the personnel to meet with Sidney and talk out their frustrations. Sidney is able to get them to reflect on the causes of their anxieties, and their moods begin to improve. Hawkeye and B.J. are surprised to see Tom in good spirits so soon after his first visit, which Sidney explains as a result of getting soldiers back on the front lines as quickly as possible, However, when face to face, Tom angrily berates Sidney for sending him back into battle so that he could be wounded again and vows never to forgive him. Afterward, Sidney and Father Mulcahy discuss the pain they feel when they lose someone under their respective care - a mind and a soul, respectively - and Mulcahy urges Sidney to focus on the success he has had in treating soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, Sergeant Zale and Private Straminsky have been tasked with burning a batch of disease-infested clothing confiscated from Chinese patients. They argue back and forth at first, but soon decide to work together and add other combustible items to the pile in order to make a larger fire. An unamused Potter initially orders them to remove the extra material, but Sidney persuades him to let them go ahead with it as a way to relieve stress. The camp builds and lights a huge bonfire, throwing on items of particular annoyance (such as a copy of the Army cookbook, Radar's bugle, and Sidney's fatigues), and sings \"Keep the Home Fires Burning.\"\n\nThe next morning, Radar digs his bugle out of the ashes and plays reveille, with Potter jokingly remarking that the instrument sounds slightly better for having been put in the fire.\n\nGuest cast is Allan Arbus as Major Sidney Freedman, Johnny Haymer as Staff Sergeant Zelmo Zale, Peter Riegert as Private Igor Straminsky, and Michael O'Keefe as Tom.\n\nIn \"Mad Dogs and Servicemen\", Michael O'Keefe played a soldier who suffered from hysterical paralysis. While the name of the soldier was Corporal Richard Travis, his middle name/nickname might have been \"Tom\". There are other indications, however, that despite the obvious similarities between the episodes there are also some notable differences: In the earlier episode, O'Keefe's character arrives at the 4077th with Hysterical Paralysis (without mentioning any specific incident that may have triggered it), so Hawkeye and Trapper contact Sidney by phone who advises them offscreen to try his technique themselves - which they do, and after some initial setbacks O'Keefe's character regains his mobility and returns to the front; however in this episode (despite utilizing the same guest actor, same diagnosis, and a similar scenario) Sidney claims that O'Keefe's character was carried into his office after witnessing 3 of his friends killed, and that he worked with the soldier directly before returning him to the front himself. He also appears grateful and shows no anger towards Hawkeye as he did in the prior episode for his role in returning him to the front, and instead directs all his hostility at Sidney.\n\nOne of two episodes where Private Igor Straminsky was played by Peter Riegert, instead of Jeff Maxwell, who portrayed Igor in 59 episodes over the run of the show.\n"}

The municipality encompasses two towns and 18 village communities. Also, \"Bukovička Banja\" Spa is located in the town.\n\nMost of the town territory used to belong to the village of Vrbica, today its suburb. Since prince Miloš Obrenović often resided in the Bukovička Banja, he decided to build a church in Vrbica in 1858 (one of his \"repentance churches\"), and dedicated it to St. Archangel Gabriel.\n\nBy the prince's decree, the growing community surrounding the church was proclaimed the town of Aranđelovac (\"The town of Archangel (Angel)\") in 1859, occupying major parts of territories of villages Vrbica and Bukovik. By the same decree, the prince ordered establishment of the spa of Bukovička Banja.\n\nThough the town itself is a 19th-century settlement, the area has been inhabited for a long time. The Paleolithic site of Risovača Cave is located at the entrance of the town. On the eastern slope of the Venčac mountain there is a locality of Dizljak, which belongs to the Neolithic Vinča culture.\n\nThe remains from the Roman period were discovered on the Mali Venčac peak. They included ceramics, glass cups and dishes, jugs, jewelry (earrings, ornamental pearls, fibulas), cloths (belts, buckles) and coins. As the area is made of limestone, artifacts corroded significantly, except for the glass remains which are exceptionally preserved. The jewelry is made of copper and silver.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, further Roman remains were unearthed on the Great Venčac, the highest peak of the mountain, some away from the Little Venčac. The remains included graves, bones, glass and ceramics. The necropolis is dated between the 4th and the 6th century and by August 2018, 23 graves were discovered, including one of a child. Four skeletons were placed in the east-west direction and the others in the northwest-southeast one. The graves are spreading in the direction of the highest peak itself, but there are no sufficient funding to explore the top of the mountain itself.\n\nIt was previously believed that this was a military outpost, but with the new discoveries, it is now believed that this was a fully developed and systematically built settlement. In the late 20th century, the probing of the terrain indicated that the dwelling units are located below the ground. The anthropological survey of the bones is planned in order to confirm that the civilians also lived in the settlement. One of the problems is the local quarry as archaeologists believe that the decades-old digging on the mountain destroyed most of the remains.\n\nIn the 2010s, the remains of the 14th-century church in the Dvorine locality were discovered, while in the 16th the area was a domain of Pavle Bakić, the last Despot of Serbia.\n\nAranđelovac has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: \"Dfb\"), that's very close to an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: \"Cfb\").\nAside from the town of Aranđelovac, the municipality comprises the following settlements:\n\nAccording to the 2011 census results, the municipality of Aranđelovac has a population of 46,225 inhabitants.\n\nThe ethnic composition of the municipality:\n\nBeing a spa resort, tourism and hospitality industry is one of the main economy activity in the town. Arandjelovac has number of hotels, including \"\", \"Šumadija\", and \"Izvor\", as well as many smaller boutique hotels, and guest houses. In addition the streets of town are littered with many cafés, bars, restaurants and shops. Rural and eco-tourism is also popular in the villages around the town.\n\nThe most known company hailing from Aranđelovac is Knjaz Miloš, which produces the widely popular mineral water, as well as juices, pop, and energy drinks. The naturally carbonised mineral water is extracted from the wells over deep, lying under famous white marble of the Vencac mountain. Marble is exploited by \"Venčac\" company. This quality material from Venčac is used to build many statues displayed in the town sprawling central park built by number of international sculptors. Company \"Šamot\" produces high temperature materials from the local deposits of aluminosilicates, while \"Elektroporcelan\" produces electrical and thermal insulation ceramics. Company \"Peštan\" specializes in PVC products. \"Kubršnica\" is the well known brick and building material factory.\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):\n\nAranđelovac is well known for the springs of remedial sparkling mineral water. Dositej Obradović, author, educator and a leader of the Serbian Enlightenment movement, brought the springs to the public spotlight by frequenting the spa in the late 18th and early 19th century. In 1809 he wrote that \"he sleeps good when he drinks the Bukovik mineral water\". Folklorist Vuk Stefanović Karadžić mentioned two sources of \"sour (or acid) water\" (which is a Serbian name for carbonated mineral water) in Serbia: \"one sour at Asan-paša Palanka\" and one \"sour again, in Bukovik\".\n\nBy personal request of prince Miloš Obrenović, the water from Bukovik mineral springs was transported and used at his court, so the villagers began to transport the water to Belgrade by the bullock carts. The caravan travelled 9 hours to Kragujevac and 13 hours to Belgrade. After the railroad was constructed through Belgrade in 1884, the water was shipped to Budapest, Vienna, London, etc. Hand-bottling of the mineral water for commercial use began at the beginning of the 20th century, and through the decades to come to receive the highest international honors for quality, including the fairs in Brussels (1906) and London (1907), when it was declared the mineral water of highest quality. A promotional photo of guys and girls in a boat on the lake of mineral water became famous throughout Europe.\n\nIn 1907 the Pavilion of Prince Miloš was built atop one of the oldest discovered springs. The pavilion was projected by architect Branko Tanazević and was the one of the first buildings in Serbia made with reinforced concrete. It was built in the Vienna Secession style and consisted of three sections. The mineral water spring was in the central part, bottling facility was in the northern wing, while there was a pastry shop in the southern wing. The southern wing was originally a veranda with a colonnade. Later, it was walled in order to enlarge the indoors of the building, and to mimic the opposing, northern wing.\n\nIn the mid 1960s, the pavilion was adapted into an art gallery. After the pavilion was damaged during the 2014 Southeast Europe floods it was renovated from September 2015 to June 2016. The aim of the project was not just the reconstruction and moist and water protection, but the restoration of the original appearance of the edifice. As no original plans survived, the object was re-measured and the old postcards were used. During the reconstruction of the floor, the original staircase with the ceramic tiles was discovered. It leads to the original bottling location, as all the springs used to be below the surface. Today they are all on the ground level. The old staircase, not being included in the project as no one knew about it, was covered again. The southern wing was restored to the original veranda look, but it was glassed with transparent glass. The mineral water is still available in the central part, only now it is conducted from all neighboring springs. Southern wing still hosts the gallery and a small museum of Bukovička Banja. The reconstruction project was awarded the 2018 Europa Nostra Award, European Union prize for cultural heritage.\n\nThe beautiful park of Bukovička Banja Spa shares the popularity with Aranđelovac mineral water. It encompasses the area of 21.5 ha with the permanent exhibition of marble figures of the most eminent domestic (ex-Yugoslavian) and foreign authors, a product of the 30-year tradition of the festival Mermer i zvuci. All the events take place in the summer open scene in the park, or in the Sala Kneževa, in the Staro Zdanje hotel. This 150-year-old hotel is situated in the park itself, and its original purpose was the summer residence for the Obrenović dynasty. The Pavilion of Prince Miloš and several mineral water springs are also situated in the park. The mineral water is used in the Spa together with clay from the local area in curing diseases of the gastrointestinal system, the liver and the biliary system, respiratory diseases, and locomotor organs. The flag-bearer of the tourism in the town, the luxurious hotel and spa resort Izvor is located adjacent to the park. In addition to accommodation for its guests, the hotel offers congress, SPA & wellness services.\n\nThe Aranđelovac municipality area also bears historical importance. First Serbian Uprising against the Turks in 1804 started in the village of Orašac ( from the town). A complex in Marićevića Jaruga in Orašac memorizes the location where the rebellion started. February 15, the day of uprising, is celebrated as the day the modern Serbian state is founded.\n\nAranđelovac is twinned with:\n\n"}

Introduced populations exist in a wide variety of locations in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nSeven subspecies of the Javan rusa are recognised:\n\n\nRusa deer are distinguished by their large ears, the light tufts of hair above the eyebrows, and antlers that appear large relative to the body size. The antlers are lyre-shaped and three-tined. Males are bigger than females; head-to-body length varies from , with a tail. Males weigh 152–160 kg, female about 74 kg. The pelage is grayish-brown and often appears coarse. Unlike most other deer species, newborn fawns do not bear spots.\n\nThe Javan rusa natively occurs on the islands of Java, Bali, and Timor in Indonesia. It has been introduced to Irian Jaya, Borneo (Kalimantan), the Lesser Sunda Islands, Maluku, Sulawesi, Pohnpei, Mauritius, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, the Christmas Islands, the Cocos Islands, Nauru, Australia, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, New Britain, and New Ireland. Rusa deer were introduced by the Dutch to New Guinea during the early 1900s.\n\nIts habitat preferences are similar to that of the chital of India: open dry and mixed deciduous forests, parklands, and savannas. Rusa deer have established populations in remote islands, probably brought there by Indonesian fishermen. They adapt well, living as comfortably in the dry Australian bush as they do in their tropical homelands. This trait is shown well in the more frequent encounters on the fringes of Wollongong and Sydney, and in particular in the Royal National Park, indicating steadily growing numbers and strong herds.\n\nRusa deer are active mostly in the early morning and late afternoon. They are rarely seen in the open and are very difficult to approach due to their keen senses and cautious instincts.\n\nThe species is very sociable, and individuals are rarely found alone. When alarmed, a rusa stag lets out an extremely loud honk. This is an alarm call and alerts any other deer in the vicinity.\n\nAs with other deer species, Javan rusa mainly feed on grass, leaves, and fallen fruit. They do not drink water, deriving all required fluid from their food.\n\nThe main predators of the species include the Javan leopard, the dhole, crocodiles, pythons, and the Komodo dragon.\n\nThe Javan rusa mates around July and August, when stags contest by calling in a loud, shrill bark and duelling with the antlers. The doe gives birth to one or two calves after a gestation period of 8 months, at the start of spring. Calves are weaned at 6–8 months, and sexual maturity is attained at 3–5 years, depending on habitat conditions. Javan rusas live 15–20 years both in the wild and in captivity.\n\n"}

The film was directed by John Stockwell and was co-distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures.\n\nA sea plane flying on a stormy night malfunctions and crashes in the sea off the coast of the Bahamas.\n\nJared and Sam are lovers living a rustic life in a trailer, next to the beach in the Bahamas. Sam works as a guide in the local aquatic theme park, while Jared works a number of odd jobs in his field of passion, diving. His real dream is to find one of many treasure-filled merchant and pirate ships lost in the waters around the Bahamas. Derek Bates has similar dreams and a better boat, but Jared turns down repeated offers to work for him.\n\nJared's childhood friend, Bryce, and his girlfriend, Amanda (whom he just met the night before), come to visit. Bryce, a lawyer in New York City, has acquired the use of a luxury vacation house from a client he defended. While snorkeling, Jared finds artifacts on the sea bed that seem to stem from a ship wreck. The four of them investigate and find several other pieces that turn out to be the remains of legendary French pirate ship \"Zephyr\". They also discover the crashed plane and its cargo of cocaine—Bryce and Amanda want to recover it, but Jared refuses, dispersing the brick they retrieved into the ocean.\n\nNeeding money for equipment to salvage the treasure, Bryce and Amanda dive to the plane then try to sell a few bricks of recovered cocaine to local night club owner Primo. Primo turns out to be an associate of drug lord Reyes, to whom the cocaine belonged in the first place.\n\nJared, Bryce, and Amanda are threatened by Reyes, who demands that they retrieve his cocaine or face deadly consequences. When the trio inform Sam, she berates Jared for violating his principles by helping a drug lord. He tries to explain the situation, but she leaves him, saying that 'they' are over. After nightfall, Jared, Bryce, and Amanda dive at the plane wreck to salvage the cocaine and more artifacts. As they are moving the cocaine packs from the plane to their boat, Amanda is attacked and bitten on the leg by a tiger shark. They abandon the cocaine at the dive site to rush her to the hospital, where she dies. Hearing of the tragedy, Sam reunites with Jared, mourning for the loss of Amanda.\n\nSam insists on going to the police, and goes to the home of one of their friends, a local cop named Roy. Roy turns her over to Derek Bates, knowing that he was Reyes' partner in the cocaine deal. Primo has captured Jared and taken him aboard Reyes' ship, where they find that Bates has killed Reyes and his entire crew, eventually killing Primo and Roy as well.\n\nJared and Bryce learn of Sam's captivity, and set out to rescue her from Bates' ship, now anchored over the cocaine plane. Sam is handcuffed and gagged with duct tape. They kill Bates' divers at the plane, while their friend Danny helps Sam dispatch the men on Bates' boat. Below, Jared and Bates are the only ones left. Jared confronts Bates in the plane, eventually using an air tank as a missile by hammering off the valve. Bates dodges it, but it hits the fuel tank at the back of the plane, causing a major explosion, killing Bates. Sam jumps into the water and rescues Jared.\n\nSix weeks later, the trio is salvaging the \"Zephyr\". While trying to bring an old cannon to the surface, the rope breaks and the cannon sinks back down breaking a part of the ship. Jared is ready to call it a night, but Bryce dives in again and shouts that he has found gold.\n\n\nThe special features section of the DVD chronicles how much of the film was filmed as live-action shots in the sea off the Bahamas, with live, wild sharks. It shows film crews wearing chain mail as protection, while the cast members perform in the water unprotected. The filming was made possible by the development of shark tourism in the Bahamas. The sharks are used to being hand fed and will not generally attack humans, but as a result, will grab any item that \"hits\" the water as potential food. In an early scene, Paul Walker has to grab two fins and a dive mask flung to him by Jessica Alba. During filming, he missed the mask. It was never seen again after hitting the water and the DVD suggests that it was taken by a shark.\n\n\"Into the Blue\" was a box-office flop. Produced on a budget of $50 million, the film made just $18 million in North America and $26 million internationally for a total of $44 million worldwide.\n\nRotten Tomatoes lists it with a \"rotten\" rating of 21% based on 125 reviews. The site's consensus is: \"Even the endless shots of bronzed beach babes and buffed dudes can't keep this soggy scuba flick's plot from drowning\". Metacritic lists a rating of 45 out of 100 based on 28 reviews, which indicates \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nJessica Alba earned a nomination for Worst Actress at the 26th Golden Raspberry Awards for her performance in the film (as well as for her performance in \"Fantastic Four\"), but lost the trophy to Jenny McCarthy for \"Dirty Love\".\n\n\"Into the Blue\" was released on VHS and DVD-Video on December 26, 2005, and on Blu-ray on August 15, 2006.\n\n\nA sequel, \"\", was released direct to DVD in 2009.

As of 2011 census, it has a population of 43,819 inhabitants.\n\nIt is the youngest municipality of Belgrade, as it split from the municipality of Zemun in 2003. Its most important feature is the Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport, located just a few kilometers west of the town.\n\nThe area of the town has been settled since prehistoric times, and archaeological findings from ancient eras are common. So far, it is established that previous settlements existed in the Stone Age, Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Roman era.\n\nFrom 1991 to 2002, the population of the municipality grew from 35,591 to 38,695. Most of that growth came from the refugees from Yugoslav Wars (mostly Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina). Since many of the refugees were integrated into the Serbian citizenship after 2002, it is to be expected that the official population has grown significantly.\n\nSurčin was the seat of its own municipality until 1965 when it was annexed to the municipality of Zemun (prior to that, municipalities of Boljevci and Dobanovci were annexed to the municipality of Surčin). A movement for splitting from Zemun has been very vocal since the 1990s and though it did not fulfill some of the conditions required by the Belgrade City statute for creation of a new municipality (mainly, a population of over 50,000), Belgrade City assembly voted to detach Surčin from Zemun officially on November 24, 2003. The newly-formed municipality remained under the administration of the municipality of Zemun until the next municipal elections and finally got its own administration on November 3, 2004. However, municipal administration and the overall political situation in Surčin has been highly unstable ever since.\n\nSurčin is located in the eastern Syrmia region, 20 kilometers west of downtown Belgrade. It borders the municipalities of Zemun (north) and Novi Beograd (east). The western border of the municipality is the administrative border of the province of Vojvodina, while the Sava river forms the border to the municipalities of Čukarica (south-east) and Obrenovac (south).\n\nThe area of the municipality is flat and marshy as the entire southern section belongs to the floodplain of the Sava. Numerous smaller streams (mostly channeled) flow through the municipality, most notably the Galovica and Jarčina. Other distinct geographical features are the ponds of Fenek and Živača, a large woody area of Bojčin (Serbian: \"Bojčinska šuma\") and Progarska ada, one of the largest islands in the Sava.\n\nSurčin lies just south of the Belgrade–Zagreb highway, on the Belgrade beltway which is expected to allow heavy traffic from the Belgrade's urban core to move directly to the city's southern outskirts (for now, it is the only European capital with a highway going through it). The Syrmian section of the beltway (which separates from the highway at Dobanovci, then goes to Surčin–Jakovo–Ostružnica) is already built and operational. A local Belgrade freight railway runs parallel to the beltway.\n\nCrni Lug (\"Black Grove\") is a low, forested floodplain along the bend of the Sava river, between Progar and Boljevci. It is a patch of an oak forest. Crni Lug is located from downtown Belgrade and south of the Nikola Tesla Airport. Part of the region is organized as a hunting ground with a total area of , of which is fenced. The venue is known for the organized group wild boar hunting. Apart from wild boar, European deer and roe deer are also being bred in the facility. There are two other hunting grounds in the municipality, Dobanovački Zabran (\"Dobanovci Grove\"), operated by the military, and Donji Srem (\"Lower Syrmia\").\n\nUrban (towns):\n\nRural (villages):\n\nAccording to the 2011 census results, the municipality of Surčin has a population of 43,819 inhabitants. Though in the past the municipality had no urban connection with Belgrade on the east, that is, Novi Beograd's westernmost neighborhood of Ledine connected it to the city, an urban zone has developed along that road, turning Belgrade and Surčin into one continuous built-up area. Similar developments surround Surčin which, with the growth of population, grows into a single urban area with Dobanovci (north), Jakovo (south) and Bečmen (west).\n\nThe municipality of Surčin has Serb ethnic majority, followed by Romani, Slovaks, Croats and other ethnic groups. The ethnic composition of the municipality:\nFormer presidents of the municipality of Surčin are:\n\nThe majority of the population works in agriculture. Extensive farms for pig breeding are located in Surčin itself while in the smaller settlements the production is mostly for the Belgrade market, growing fruits and early vegetables.\n\nThe most important facility is the Belgrade Nikola Tesla airport, opened on April 28, 1962, replacing the old one in Bežanija. The new and modern airport put the small village on the map. The aeronautics museum is also located in the airport complex.\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):\n"}

The cover version by John Legend, Joss Stone, and Van Hunt, won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at 49th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nReleased on November 6, 1971, \"Family Affair\" was markedly different from the earlier Sly & the Family Stone hits. Engineering consultant Richard Tilles muted most of Sly Stone's guitar parts while emphasizing the electric piano played by Billy Preston and \"edit[ing] the rhythm box to sound like a heartbeat,\" according to David Hepworth. Sly Stone and his sister Rose sing lead on the song. Bobby Womack was invited to play rhythm guitar. The lyrics reflect the good and bad aspects of being family, with Sly delivering his part in a low funk-styled tone instead of his earlier gospel-based shout, sounding off rhythm and off key. Sly's screams emulate a child crying.\n\n\"Family Affair\" was the most successful hit of Sly & the Family Stone's career, peaking at number-one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for three weeks, while achieving the same on the Billboard R&B Singles chart for five weeks. \"Billboard\" ranked it as the No. 79 song for 1972. The band's long-awaited fifth album, \"There's a Riot Goin' On\", debuted at number one on the Billboard soul album charts during the same period. \"There's a Riot Goin' On\" was typified by a deep, dark style of funk, evident in \"Family Affair\", that earned the album a place as one of the most influential albums of all time.\n\nRecorded in his Bel Air home studio and in New York at CBS, and mixed in Los Angeles at The Record Plant, with the exception of his sister Rose singing the refrain, \"It's a family affair\", Sly did not utilize the Family Stone for this recording. His friend Billy Preston played the keyboard lines in the song with Sly also playing keyboard as well as guitar, bass, and programming the rhythm box.\n\nAccording to the biography \"Sly and the Family Stone: An Oral History\", Sly Stone felt that this song wasn't strong enough to be released as a single.

The song's drum machine-created rhythm was duplicated in several early to mid-1970s recordings, in particular The Temptations' \"Let Your Hair Down\" (1973), and Stevie Wonder's \"You Haven't Done Nothin'\" (1974).\n\nChuck Brown & the Soul Searchers performed a Go-go rendition for the album \"Go Go Swing Live\" (1986).\n\nMadonna featured this song as an intro to \"Keep It Together\" on her Blond Ambition Tour in 1990. \nAustralian singer Stephen Cummings released a version as the second single from his fifth studio album, \"Good Humour\". A rap-infused, danceable cover was released by German Milli Vanilli spinoff band Try 'N' B in 1992. Another retooled cover was done in 1993 by Shabba Ranks featuring Patra and Terri & Monica as a single for the \"\" soundtrack. This version charted on the \"Billboard\" pop chart at number 84, number 16 on the R&B chart, and number-six on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. Prince sampled the song on his track \"Y Should Eye Do That When Eye Can Do This?\".\n\nJanet Jackson sampled the song on the track \"And On and On\", the B-side to her single \"Any Time, Any Place\".\n\nShola Ama referenced the song on the track Lovely Affair on her 1999 second album \"In Return\"\n\nThe Black Eyed Peas song \"Weekends\" from their 2000 album \"Bridging the Gap\" samples \"Family Affair\".\nIn 2005, John Legend, Joss Stone and Van Hunt recorded a cover featuring elements of the original recording for \"Different Strokes by Different Folks\", a Sly & the Family Stone tribute/remix album. This version of \"Family Affair\" won the 2007 Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.\n\nJazz bassist Christian McBride recorded a cover on his album \"A Family Affair\".\n\nMFSB recorded an instrumental version of the song for their 1973 album \"MFSB\".\n\n\n"}

He graduated from Poly Prep Country Day School in 1961. He played the tight end position at Wagner College on Staten Island before being drafted in the 18th round of the 1965 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings. After playing for his hometown New York Giants in 1967, he went to the Pittsburgh Steelers the next year before returning to the Giants for a four-year stint starting in 1968.\n\nAfter his professional football career was over, Kotite spent much of the next two decades as an assistant coach in the NFL, including a lengthy stint as offensive coordinator of the New York Jets.\n\nRich Kotite was hired in 1990 to replace Ted Plumb as offensive coordinator of the Philadelphia Eagles. He was promoted to head coach after the firing of his predecessor, Buddy Ryan.\n\nKotite led the Eagles to 10- and 11-win seasons in 1991 and 1992, respectively, despite the loss of Eagles quarterback Randall Cunningham for the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament on opening day of 1991, but still with the draft talent that had been selected by Buddy Ryan over the preceding five years. The defense that year under Bud Carson, architect and defensive coordinator of Pittsburgh's famed Steel Curtain of the 1970s, led the league by accomplishing the rare trifecta of being the number one run defense, the number one pass defense, and number one in total defense. The Eagles were a wild card in the 1992 playoffs, finishing 8–0 at home. However, in the spring of 1993, the talent that had been drafted by Buddy Ryan began leaving the Eagles during free agency. Kotite had poor drafts and the level of talent dropped precipitously as his draft picks began replacing the talent that had been drafted by Ryan. In the 1993 season, the Eagles went 8–8. One of the many things for which Kotite was criticized for in Philadelphia was for saying at the conclusion of the season, \"Hey, eight and eight is great.\" An incident which seemed to antagonize Eagles fans occurred the following season, in a Week 7 game against the Cowboys that the Eagles lost 24–13. At the post-game press conference, when asked, he stated that the reason he went for a (failed) two point conversion attempt rather than kick the point after following the second touchdown late in the fourth quarter, was because the \"rain made the ink run and blurred the chart, so I couldn't see what was written on it to know what to do.\"\n\nThe Eagles began the 1994 season 7–2, including a 40–8 thrashing of that season's eventual Super Bowl XXIX champion San Francisco 49ers, and Kotite achieving his seventh win against the Arizona Cardinals, then coached by his former boss, Buddy Ryan. Looking forward, a playoff berth seemed assured and Kotite's future seemed bright. In the spring of that year the Eagles were purchased by Jeffrey Lurie from former owner Norman Braman. Whenever asked by the media if he was going to retain Rich Kotite as head coach of the Eagles going forward after the season, Lurie usually replied to the effect that it was too early in the process to be able to say anything, that any measured evaluation would have to take place at the conclusion of the season, and that he wished to keep his options open. After beating the Cardinals for that seventh win, Kotite sarcastically used Lurie's words and told the media that he would be doing his own evaluations at the end of the season and keeping his own options open. The Eagles lost all seven of their remaining games, finishing the season 7–9, behind the Cowboys (12–4), Giants (9–7), and Cardinals (8–8), then still in the NFC East; Kotite was fired by the Eagles one day after the season ended.\n\nAfter the Eagles let Kotite go, he returned to his home town as head coach of the New York Jets, who had just fired Pete Carroll after one losing season (6–10). Owner Leon Hess named Kotite general manager as well. But under his leadership, the Jets suffered what are still the two worst seasons in franchise history. Kotite won only four games in two seasons, falling to 3–13 in 1995 and 1–15 in 1996 for the worst record in the league both years. Poorly handled drafts contributed to the disappointing seasons, most notably Kotite's first round selection of tight end Kyle Brady over the heavily favored Warren Sapp in 1995. The losing seasons and inept drafts led to mockery; Jets fans started calling him Rich Kotex, a crude reference to a popular feminine hygiene product. Two days before the last game of the 1996 season, Kotite announced he was stepping down as head coach. He has not coached in the NFL again in any capacity.\n\nAfter his coaching days were over, Kotite was involved in two TV promotional commercials, for the USA Network's during the US Open Tennis championships, and for AmeriTrade during the Super Bowl XXXIV pregame show casting him as father of a son who surprises him by telling him he wants to be a Broadway dancer. He continued his media career for the NFL as a regular contributor to NFL Films programming on the NFL Network in particular, including the \"NFL Top 10\" show.\n\n"}

{"id": "2184696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184696", "title": "Flatback sea turtle", "text": "Flatback sea turtle\n\nThe Australian flatback sea turtle (\"Natator depressus\") is a species of sea turtle in the family Cheloniidae. The species is endemic to the sandy beaches and shallow coastal waters of the Australian continental shelf. This turtle gets its common name from the fact that its shell has a flattened or lower dome than the other sea turtles. It can be olive green to grey with a cream underside. It averages from 76 to 96 cm (30 to 38 inches) in carapace length and can weigh from 70 to 90 kg (154 to 198 lb). The hatchlings, when emerging from nests, are larger than other sea turtle hatchlings when they hatch. The flatback turtle is listed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as Data Deficient, meaning there is insufficient scientific information to determine its conservation status at this time. It was previously listed as Vulnerable in 1994. It is not as threatened as other sea turtles due to its small dispersal range.\n\nThe flatback sea turtle was originally described as \"Chelonia depressa\" in 1880 by American herpetologist Samuel Garman. The genus \"Natator\" (meaning \"swimmer\") was created in 1908 by Australian ichthyologist Allan Riverstone McCulloch, and in the same scientific paper he described what he thought to be a new species, \"Natator tessellatus\", thereby creating a junior synonym. In 1988 Swiss paleontologist assigned the flatback sea turtle to the genus \"Natator\" as the new combination \"Natator depressus\". Because \"Chelonia\" is feminine, and \"Natator\" is masculine, the specific name was changed from \"depressa\" to \"depressus\".\n\nThe flatback turtle is a sea turtle that can be recognized by its smooth flat-domed shell, or carapace, which has upturned edges along the sides. It has the coloration of olive green or a mixture of grey and green. This matches the coloration of its head. The underside, also called the plastron, has a much lighter coloration of a pale yellow. The flatback sea turtle has an average carapace length ranging from 76 to 96 cm (30 to 38 in), and weighs from 70 to 90 kg (about 155 to 200 lb). The females of this species are larger than the males in adulthood and also have been found to have longer tails than their male counterparts.\n\nFeatures of this sea turtle which help contribute to its recognition are the single pair of prefrontal scales on the head, and the four pairs of coastal scutes on the carapace. Another unique feature of this species of sea turtle is the fact that its carapace is found to be much thinner than other sea turtle carapaces. This feature causes the shell to crack under the smallest pressures.\n\nThe flatback sea turtle has the smallest range of the seven sea turtles. It is found in the continental shelf and coastal waters of tropic regions. It does not travel long distances in the open ocean for migrations like other sea turtles. It can typically be found in waters of or less in depth. It does not have a global distribution like the other sea turtles. The flatback sea turtle can be found along the coastal waters of Northern Australia, the Tropic of Capricorn, and the coastal areas of Papua New Guinea. Its distribution within Australia is in the areas of eastern Queensland, Torres Strait and Gulf of Carpentaria, Northern Territory, and Western Australia.\n\nThe distribution of nesting sites can be found across Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia, with the greatest concentration found in Queensland, in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Within Queensland, the nesting sites can be found from the south in Bundaberg to the Torres Strait in the north. The main nesting sites in this range are the southern Great Barrier Reef, Wild Duck, and Curtis Island. The Torres Strait contains the major nesting sites for these turtles. Within the Northern Territory, nesting sites are more widely dispersed in this area with a wide variety of beach types on this coastline. In the Western Australia area, the important nesting sites found have been the Kimberley Region, Cape Dommett, and the Lacrosse Island.\n\nThe flatback sea turtle lives in the shallow, soft-bottomed tropical and subtropical waters. This turtle sticks to the continental shelf of Australia and can be found in grassy areas, bays, lagoons, estuaries, and any place with a soft-bottomed sea bed. The habitats that females prefer for nesting sites are sandy beaches in tropical and subtropical areas. They prefer beaches where the sand temperature can be in the range of 29 °C to 33 °C (84 to 91 °F) at nest depth, which are the temperatures that help determine the hatchling's sex.\n\nThe hatchlings begin to leave the nests during the beginning of December, and the clutches will continue to hatch until late March. The peak of hatchling emergence can be seen during February. A flatback sea turtle hatchling is larger than other sea turtle hatchlings with its carapace length averaging . Its large size helps protect it from some of the predators after hatching, and allows it to also be a stronger swimmers. The hatchlings tend to stay close to shore and lack the pelagic phase of other sea turtles. The hatchlings will feed on the macroplankton present in their surface-dwelling environment.\n\nA flatback sea turtle is sexually mature anywhere between 7–50 years of age, and an adult female will nest every two to three years. Mating occurs while the male and female are out at sea; therefore, the males will never return to shore after they hatch. The flatback nesting sites can only be found along the coast of Australia within the slopes of the dunes. A female will return to the same beach for her subsequent clutches within the same nesting season. She will return for other nesting seasons, as well. Depending on the area of the nesting site, the nesting season can go from November to January or can last the entire year. Females are able to lay up to four times throughout the nesting season, and the intervals between nesting can be 13–18 days. While using her front flippers to dig, the female will clear away the dry sand located at the top. After she clears the sand, the female will create an egg chamber using her back flippers. After she has laid her eggs, she will then cover the nest again using her back flippers, while also tossing sand back with her front flippers.\n\nThe number of eggs in a flatback sea turtle's clutch are fewer than other sea turtles. It will have an average of 50 eggs laid each time in a clutch, while other sea turtles may lay up to 100-150 eggs in a clutch. The eggs are about long within these clutches. The sex of the flatback turtle hatchling is determined by the temperature of the sand that the egg is in. If the temperature is below 29 °C (84 °F), the hatchling will be a male, and if the temperature is above this 29 °C it will be female.\n\nThe flatback sea turtle is an omnivorous species, but predominantly eats a carnivorous diet. It feeds mostly on the prey found within the shallow waters where it swims. It has been found to feed on soft corals, sea cucumbers, shrimp, jellyfish, mollusks, and other invertebrates. It will also occasionally feed on seagrasses, even though it rarely feeds on vegetation.\nThe flatback sea turtle is preyed upon by both terrestrial and aquatic organisms. The terrestrial predators it must face are foxes, feral dogs, and pigs. The aquatic predators to this turtle are sharks. The hatchlings also face predation from crabs, birds, and small crocodiles on their journey to the waters. Once in the water, the hatchlings can be preyed upon by fish and even sharks. Due to their large size when they are born and their strong swimming skills, the likelihood of capture is lowered.\n\nOn the International Union for the Conservation of Nature or the IUCN's official website the flatback sea turtle is listed as Data Deficient. However, the flatback sea turtle is listed as Vulnerable nationally in Australia. It is the least endangered of all of the sea turtles. Unlike other sea turtles, there is not a big human demand for the meat of the flatback sea turtle. It does not swim far from shore; thus, it does not get caught in nets as often as other sea turtles. These reasons can contribute to why it is not in more danger of extinction.\n\nAll marine turtles are faced with threats such as habitat loss, the wildlife trade, collection of eggs, collection of meat, by-catch, pollution, and climate change. The flatback sea turtle is specifically threatened by the direct harvest of eggs and meat by the indigenous people of Australia for traditional hunting. These people are given the right to harvest by the government, but only if for non-commercial purposes. Another threat is the destruction of nesting beaches due to coastal development and the destruction of feeding sites at coral reefs and the shallow areas near the shore. Camping on these beaches compacts the sand and contributes to dune erosion, and the wheel ruts caused by vehicles driving on the beaches can trap the hatchlings on their journey to the sea. Coastal development contributes to barriers that make it difficult or impossible for adult turtles to reach nesting and feeding sites. The flatback sea turtle also falls prey to incidental capture. It is caught by fishermen, particularly by trawling, gillnet fishing, ghost nets, and crab pots. Lastly, pollution is a concern for this creature. Pollution can affect the timing of egg laying, how it chooses its nesting site, how hatchlings find the sea after emerging, and how adult turtles find the beaches.\n\nHistorically climate change was thought to be a influential factor affecting the success of flatback sea turtle development, however, through recent research, performed on a select group of turtles, this was found to be untrue. Researchers have studied whether increased nest temperatures would be detrimental to embryos, whether through embryo death or negatively adapted phenotypes. However, the increased nest temperature did not reduce the success of the hatchlings, the hatchling body size, but it did accelerate the development of the embryo. It was also discovered that there was a high 'pivotal sex-determining temperature' in the specific flatback population, which shows that some populations may had adapted to maintain large number of hatchlings of both sexes even under the effects of climate change.\n\nIn 2003, a recovery plan was set in place nationally to help this species along with other sea turtles. This plan aims to reduce mortality rates through actions within commercial fisheries and to maintain a sustainable harvest by indigenous people. Monitoring programs are being developed and integrated, along with managing factors that affect the reproductive success of this species. In Kakadu National Park, a monitoring program has already been set up for this species. This species' critical habitat is being identified for protection. People are also trying to enhance the communication about information on the flatback sea turtle, and enhance the cooperation and actions internationally. \n\n"}

Currently, certain trains would still terminate at this station for the truncated service between Yishun station and Marina South Pier MRT station which only operates during morning peak hours on weekdays.\n\nYishun station is located at the junction of Yishun Avenue 2 and Yishun Avenue 5, and is currently one of the two MRT stations that serve Yishun New Town; the other being Khatib MRT station.\n\nYishun opened on 20 December 1988, two years earlier than planned. During the start of construction in December 1984, Nee Soon North― the original name of the station― was renamed to Yishun and Nee Soon South was renamed to Khatib. In 1990, there was a power failure which occurred at Yishun station. Before the underpass link to Northpoint was completed in 1993, there was a pedestrian crossing that linked the station and bus interchange.\n\nIn December 2001, the Singapore embassies attack plot was discovered, and had included plans to bomb Yishun MRT station at several points, including the sewers near the station. This was brought up in a debate during a session of the parliament, during which new security measures were proposed, especially on the MRT system itself.\n\nOn 16 April 2003, power supply to trackside equipment between Yio Chu Kang and Sembawang stations was disrupted at 8.02 am due to a lightning strike which affected eight point machines along the track.

{"id": "2184754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184754", "title": "Where Do Broken Hearts Go", "text": "Where Do Broken Hearts Go\n\n\"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\" is the fourth single from Whitney Houston's second album, \"Whitney\". The ballad was released on February 25, 1988. The song was written by Frank Wildhorn and Chuck Jackson and produced by Narada Michael Walden. Due to Wildhorn's previous working relationship with Arista Records CEO Clive Davis, he had been approached about potentially writing for Houston. He contacted Jackson, who came up with the title, after which Wildhorn completed the music and lyrics for the song. Smokey Robinson originally wanted to record the song; however, Wildhorn and Jackson held the song for Houston.\n\nInitially, Houston did not want to record the song, feeling there was no special message to convey. In a 2000 interview, Houston reminisced that she \"hated the song\". However, Davis believed the song would go to number one if she recorded it, so she agreed. It indeed became a number one, Houston's seventh consecutive number-one single in the United States—a record for consecutive number-one singles that still stands to this day.\n\nHouston remained perplexed by the song and its lyrics. Wildhorn later recalled that Houston sent him a letter essentially asking: \"Where do broken hearts go? I have no idea.\"\n\nAllMusic's Ron Wynn highlighted this track. Robert Hilburn of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described this song as a ballad \"that raises questions without making you care about the answers.\" Pop Rescue noted it as a \"classic big 80s power ballad\", adding it as \"the perfect ending to a school disco.\"\n\n\"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\", released off \"Whitney\" as the fourth single in February 1988, debuted at number 47 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Singles chart in the issue dated February 27, 1988. Within four weeks of its release the single reached the top ten on the chart, and finally peaked at number one in the issue dated April 23, 1988 after nine weeks on the chart, making Houston the only artist in pop history with seven consecutive number-one hits. In addition, she became the first female artist to achieve four number-one singles from one album, \"Whitney\". To date, only four other albums by women have yielded four Hot 100 number-one hits; Paula Abdul's \"Forever Your Girl\" in 1988, Janet Jackson's \"Rhythm Nation 1814\" in 1989, Mariah Carey's self-titled debut in 1990 and Katy Perry's \"Teenage Dream\" in 2010. Houston also had the most number-one hits (7) by a female artist in the 1980s, a feat equaled only by Madonna. The song topped the chart for two weeks, and spent 18 weeks on the chart. It entered the \"Billboard\" R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart (formerly \"Hot Black Singles\") at number 60, the issue date of March 5, 1988 and nine weeks later reached a peak of number two (behind \"Nite and Day\" by Al B. Sure!), becoming Houston's ninth R&B top five hit. On the \"Billboard\" Hot Adult Contemporary chart, the single peaked at number one, the issue dated April 2, 1988, and remained there for three weeks, making it her sixth No. 1 single on the chart. It was ranked number 33 and 47, on the \"Billboard\" Top Pop and Top Black Singles year-end charts for 1988, respectively. The single also placed at number two on the Top Adult Contemporary Singles year-end chart of the same year. In Canada, the song entered \"RPM\" Top 100 Singles chart at number 76, the issue date of March 5, 1988, and peaked at number six on the chart on May 14, 1988, becoming Houston's eighth top ten hit in the country.\n\nWorldwide, \"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\" was not as commercially successful as her previous singles from the album \"Whitney\". The single debuted at number 30 on the UK Singles Chart, the week ending date of March 12, 1988, and three weeks later reached a peak of number 14 on the chart. In Ireland, it peaked at number two, the highest chart position of the song outside the United States. The song also reached number 48 in Australia, number 24 in Italy, number 47 in the Netherlands, and number 23 in New Zealand.\nThe song was very popular in the Philippines, and it became one of the main focus of the 2014 indie romantic film \"That Thing Called Tadhana\".\n\nThe music video (directed by Peter Israelson) features Houston breaking up with a boyfriend and reflecting on happy memories; asking herself the title question, \"where do broken hearts go?\" At the conclusion of the music video, the couple reunites.\n\nHouston is depicted in various \"glamour girl\" shots throughout the video; Arista executives reportedly joked at the time, \"there's her screen test\", referring to rumors about Houston's Hollywood ambitions. In 2002, Israelson told Liquid Assets, a British TV documentary series focused on the net worth of celebrities, that Houston's performance in the video's 1940s-themed train station scene (filmed at Newark Penn Station) convinced Kevin Costner of her acting abilities for The Bodyguard.\n\nThe video was moderately controversial since the ambiguous ethnic background of Houston's love interest (reportedly Houston's then real-life love interest, New York restaurateur Brad Johnson) highlighted the racial sensitivities that accompanied Houston's success during the 1980s. The singer had been criticized for \"selling out\" and \"acting white\". A mostly-black audience jeered when \"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\" was nominated for an award at the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards.\n\nHouston first performed \"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\" at Montreux Golden Rose Rock Festival on May 15, 1987. The performance was broadcast later in the US, as well as on various European TV channels. Houston sang the song at The 15th American Music Awards, held on January 25, 1988. She lip-synced to the album version of the song on the UK BBC1 TV show \"Wogan\", which was hosted by Terry Wogan in 1988. \"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\" was one of the Houston's set list during \"Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Celebration\" concert, televised live worldwide via BBC, at Wembley Stadium in London on June 11, 1988. In the US, the edit version of the concert was broadcast later on Fox TV network.\n\nAside from the several live televised performances, the song was included on the set-lists on Houston's four tours, usually serving as part of a love song medley along with her other ballad hits. During her Moment of Truth World Tour (1987–88), the performance of the song was a little different to the album version. She started the song to usual tempo and was completed the song in an extended coda vamp, used her chest voice and falsetto appropriately. On her Feels So Right Japan Tour in 1990 and I'm Your Baby Tonight World Tour in 1991, Houston performed the song as the final part of a love song medley with \"All at Once,\" \"Didn't We Almost Have It All\" and \"A House Is Not a Home.\" She sang the additional lyrics such as \"take me in your arms\" and \"say that you love me\" extemporaneously at the end of the song. During I'm Your Baby Tonight World Tour, Houston performed the love song medley with the song at \"Welcome Home Heroes with Whitney Houston\" concert, dedicated to the US troops, their families in honor of those returning from the Gulf War, which was broadcast live via HBO on March 31, 1991. Similarly, during The Bodyguard World Tour (1993–94), \"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\" was used as the fourth part of a love song medley, added \"Nobody Loves Like You Do\" and \"All the Man That I Need\" to the previous tours'. In 1998, on Houston's 10-dates European Tour, she also delivered a performance of the song as the final part of a love song medley.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2184760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184760", "title": "Champions (1975 team)", "text": "Champions (1975 team)\n\nThe Champions are a fictional team of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team first appears in \"The Champions\" #1 (October 1975) and was created by writer Tony Isabella and artist Don Heck. Their titular series is regarded as an example of a failed superteam comic, suffering from constant turnover in the writers and artists working on the series, lack of a consistent direction or concept, and mediocre sales.\n\nAccording to the letters page of \"Champions\" #6, writer Tony Isabella developed the concept of a new team of superheroes and originally wanted the roster to consist of former X-Men the Angel and the Iceman, and the newly created Black Goliath. Black Goliath became unavailable when the character debuted in his own title, forcing Isabella to rethink the concept. Editor Len Wein insisted on at least five members, and Isabella added three established heroes: Russian spy Black Widow, the Greek god Hercules, and the supernatural avenger Ghost Rider. Captain Marvel, Power Man, and the Son of Satan were all considered for the final place on the roster before selecting the Ghost Rider. Writer and publisher David Anthony Kraft is credited with naming the team, with the title originally intended to be published in the \"Giant-Size\" format as \"Giant-Size Champions\". Production difficulties, which caused a three-month delay between the first and second issues, prevented this.\n\nIsabella has disputed this account on several points. First, he said, his original concept for the series was not a team book at all, but a humorous heroes-on-the-highway series in the vein of \"Route 66\" with Angel and Iceman. Black Goliath was not discussed during the meeting which laid out the series concept, but rather was a character he planned to have join the Champions later, precisely \"because\" he was a character with his own series, also written by Isabella. Finally, he insisted that the series was always going to be in a regular size format, and has hypothesized that the \"giant-size\" story was put forward to cover up the fact that the team was missing deadlines. He also said that he chose the Black Widow, Hercules, and the Ghost Rider for the group under the editorial requirements that the team must have a woman, a strong man, and at least one character with their own series.\n\nThe title was eventually published as \"The Champions\", and ran for 17 issues from October 1975 to January 1978. Publication continued to be erratic; the series went back and forth between monthly and bi-monthly throughout its run. The creative team saw an exceptionally high level of overturn, with 12 different writer/penciller/inker combinations over the course of just 17 issues. In addition to Don Heck, artists who drew the series include George Tuska, Bob Hall, and John Byrne. Starting with issue #8, the remainder of the series was written and pencilled by industry newcomers still learning their craft with the sole exception that the final issue was pencilled by Tuska. Though the reason for this is not known, it has been hypothesized that the series was already on the brink of cancellation at this point, making it a less risky place to field rookie creators.\n\nA common criticism of \"The Champions\" was that the team lacked any sort of theme or reason for the members to continue working together. Isabella intended from the beginning for the Champions to be a superhero team for the common man, but admitted that the series never brought this theme across in a convincing way. The team never acquired their own rogues gallery, and instead battled established Marvel villains such as Pluto, the Stranger, and Kamo Tharnn, along with the occasional new foe such as Swarm. The Black Widow is elected the leader of the Champions in issue #5, and in issue #7 the team gets a headquarters. Russian heroine Darkstar became a regular character starting in issue #10, though she never actually joins the team. Black Goliath guest-stars in issue #11.\n\nIn an effort to boost the series's flagging sales, the Champions were featured as guest-stars for three consecutive months: in \"Iron Man Annual\" #4 (August 1977), \"The Avengers\" #163 (September 1977), and \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters\" #3 (October 1977). The attempt failed, and \"Champions\" was cancelled with issue #17. The second-to-last issue continued a story involving a power struggle between villains Doctor Doom and Magneto from the title \"Super-Villain Team-Up\". Loose plot threads left by the last issue were wrapped up in \"Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man\" #17-18 (April-May 1978), in which the Champions disband.\n\nIn the short story \"On the Air\", published in the 1996 anthology \"The Ultimate X-Men\", an interviewer asks the Angel about the Champions. The Angel defends the group's worth, saying they should be judged not by the short time they were together, but by how many people they helped. The group briefly reunite in an \"X-Force/Champions Annual\". An issue of \"The Incredible Hulk\" features an untold tale of the Champions.\n\nA new team also called the Champions, composed of teenage superheroes and with no connection to the 1970s team, debuted in October 2016.\n\nIn 1987, Heroic Publishing began using the name \"The Champions\" for a role-playing game series which has been adapted into comic books. The United States Patent and Trademark Office ruled that Marvel had abandoned its trademark of the name and could no longer use it, causing a planned 2007 revival of the series to be renamed \"The Order\". This has since been resolved, with Marvel publishing a new \"Champions\" series that debuted following their \"Civil War II\" event.\n\n\n"}

Michael Bailey\n\nJohn Michael Bailey (born July 2, 1957) is an American psychologist and professor at Northwestern University. He is best known among scientists for his work on the etiology of sexual orientation, from which he concluded that homosexuality is substantially inherited. He also wrote \"The Man Who Would Be Queen\", which has elicited reactions ranging from strong criticism to a nomination for an award, later retracted, from the Lambda Literary Foundation, an organization that promotes gay literature. According to Google Scholar, Bailey's works have been cited more than 15,000 times and he has an h-index of 60.\n\nBailey was born in Lubbock, Texas. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Washington University in 1979 and his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Texas at Austin in 1989, where he studied under behavioral genetics researcher Lee Willerman.\n\nBailey became a professor at Northwestern University in 1989. In the 1990s, Bailey published several papers that suggested a heritable component for sexual orientation. In 2003 he published \"The Man Who Would Be Queen\".\n\nIn October 2004, Bailey stepped down as chairman of the Psychology Department. Bailey continues to serve as a Northwestern professor.\n\nBailey is well known for research involving biology and sexual orientation. In the early 1990s Bailey and Richard Pillard coauthored a series of twin studies which examined the rate of concordance of sexual identity among monozygotic twins (52% concordance), dizygotic twins of the same sex (22%), non-twin siblings of the same sex, and adoptive siblings of the same sex (11%). More recent research by Bailey et al. on twins however found much lower concordance rates for monozygotic twins regarding homosexual orientation of only 20% for men and 24% for women pointing to a significant contribution of environmental factors in sexual orientation; Bailey suggests an explanation for the much lower concordance rate among monozygotic twins in this study as opposed to previous studies: In those previous studies, twins deciding whether to participate in a study clearly related to homosexuality probably considered the sexual orientation of their co-twins before agreeing to participate.\n\nAnother line of Bailey's research has concerned the ways that homosexuals are sex-atypical (or gender nonconforming) compared with heterosexuals, as well as the ways that homosexuals are sex-typical and gender conforming. For example, he published a meta-analysis showing that on average, homosexual men and women recall being much more gender nonconforming children, compared with heterosexual children. In contrast, he also showed that for many traits related to mating (such as interest in casual sex, and emphasis on a partner's physical attractiveness), homosexuals appear to be similar to heterosexuals of their own sex. He has also researched the gaydar phenomenon.\n\nBailey has been interested in the evolutionary paradox of the persistence of homosexuality. \"Male homosexuality is evolutionarily maladaptive,\" he told \"The New York Times\", which also noted that Bailey intended \"that the phrase means only that genes favoring homosexuality cannot be favored by evolution if fewer such genes reach the next generation.\"\n\nIn an article coauthored with Aaron Greenberg, he suggested that allowing parents to choose the sexual orientation of their children is morally acceptable, provided the means used to accomplished that goal are themselves morally acceptable. (For example, killing infants who will become homosexual would obviously be wrong. The acceptability of aborting \"gay fetuses\" or \"straight fetuses\" would depend on whether one believed that abortion, per se, is morally acceptable.) Alice Dreger criticized Greenberg's and Bailey's argument and they responded.\n\nA third line of research has examined sexual arousal patterns and their relation to sexual orientation in men and women. This research has focused on both genital and self-reported sexual arousal measures. For example, Bailey's lab showed that men's genital sexual arousal patterns closely tracked their sexual orientations, but women's did not. In 2005 this research produced a study which questioned whether male bisexuality exists in the way that it is sometimes described; the study was based on results of penile plethysmograph testing. The testing found that of men who identified themselves as bisexual, 75% were substantially more aroused genitally by sexual imagery of men, and 25% were substantially more aroused genitally by sexual imagery of women. They concluded: \"Male bisexuality appears primarily to represent a style of interpreting or reporting sexual arousal rather than a distinct pattern of genital sexual arousal.\" The study received wide attention after a \"New York Times\" piece on the study. A 2011 study using similar methodology filtered participants more stringently, requiring at least two sexual partners of each sex and at least one romantic relationship lasting three months or longer; this study finds both genital and subjective arousal, though it is not clear which arousal pattern is more prevalent in the modern bisexual community.\n\nThe 2005 article and study were criticized by gay and bisexual groups and by FAIR. Critics argued the sample size was relatively small, consisting of 100 men. Also, all of these subjects were \"self-selected\", from ads placed in gay and \"alternative\" publications. Then the researchers had to disregard results of 35% of this population as non-responders. Agreeing with the author's conclusion that bisexuality is a subjective experience, Fritz Klein, a sex researcher and the author of \"The Bisexual Option\", argued that \"social and emotional attraction are very important elements in bisexual attraction.\"\n\nBailey's sexual arousal work was attacked by \"The Washington Times\" and some socially conservative commentators as prurient and a waste of taxpayer dollars. Bailey and his defenders have responded that studying sexual arousal patterns is important in understanding human sexuality, especially sexual orientation. Bailey's lab has also studied sexual orientation and sexual arousal using fMRI.\n\nBailey's book \"The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender Bending and Transsexualism\" was published in 2003. In it, Bailey reviewed evidence that male homosexuality is innate, a result of heredity and prenatal environment. He also reviewed the theory of Ray Blanchard that there are two unrelated forms of transsexualism, one that is an extreme type of homosexuality and one that is an expression of a paraphilia known as autogynephilia. Written in a popular science style, the book summarized research supporting Bailey's opinions.\n\nThe book generated considerable controversy. The most detailed investigation into that controversy was reported by Alice Dreger, a bioethicist and historian, known for her activism in support of intersex rights. Dreger included additional details in \"Galileo’s Middle Finger,\" an analysis of modern clashes between scientists and activists whose beliefs are challenged by them. In her documented account of the Bailey case, she concluded that a small group of self-styled activists tried to bury a politically challenging scientific theory by attacking Bailey. \"These critics, rather than restrict themselves to the argument over the ideas, had charged Bailey with a whole host of serious crimes,\" but that \"what they claimed about Bailey simply wasn't true.\"\n\nA transgender woman that he described in the book filed a complaint with Northwestern University alleging that her many discussions with Bailey about his view of trans women and the book he was writing made her a non-consensual subject of IRB-regulated research by Bailey, and that during this time, she had consensual sex with him. Northwestern found no basis for the complaint. Transgender professors Lynn Conway and Deirdre McCloskey filed a complaint against Bailey with Illinois state regulators, alleging that he practiced psychology without a license by providing brief case evaluation letters suggesting candidacy for sex reassignment surgery; however, the department did not pursue those allegations, as he did not accept remuneration for the services and therefore did not violate the law. At least two women who said they were subjects in his book filed a complaint with Northwestern alleging that Bailey committed scientific misconduct by not informing them that they were to be the subjects of research used in the writing of his book. Northwestern did investigate this allegation. Although the findings of that investigation were not released, Northwestern's Vice President for Research, C. Bradley Moore, said, \"The allegations of scientific misconduct made against Professor J. Michael Bailey do not fall under the federal definition of scientific misconduct.\" and that the university \"has established a protocol to help ensure that Professor Bailey's research activities involving human subjects are conducted in accordance with the expectations of the University, the regulations and guidelines established by the federal government and with generally accepted research standards.\" Bailey says that he did nothing wrong and that the attacks on him were motivated by the desire to suppress discussion of the book's ideas about transsexualism, especially autogynephilia. Alice Dreger, a bioethicist, published an account of the controversy in the \"Archives of Sexual Behavior\". According to Dreger, the allegations of misconduct could accurately be described as \"harassment\", and an \"anti-Bailey campaign\". Dreger wrote that of the four women who complained to Northwestern, two acknowledged that they were aware they would be included in Bailey's book in their letter to the university. The other two were not described in the book. Dreger also reported that while there was no definitive evidence to refute the allegation of sexual misconduct, datestamps on e-mails between Bailey and his ex-wife indicated that he was at her home looking after their two children at the time the misconduct was said to have occurred. The journal published in the same issue 23 commentaries regarding multiple aspects of the controversy, including criticism of Dreger's analysis.\n\nOutside of the transsexual community and sexology researchers, this controversy is largely notable because of its implications for academic freedom and freedom of speech. In an interview with \"The New York Times\", Dreger said, \"If we're going to have research at all, then we're going to have people saying unpopular things, and if this is what happens to them, then we've got problems not only for science but free expression itself.\" While Conway compared his work to Nazi propaganda, and Andrea James posted pictures of his children on her website with sexually explicit captions, other critics believe that their actions against Bailey and his book represent legitimate comment on a topic of public interest.\n\nHelen Boyd explained what might have motivated some to object to the book:\nIn response to such criticisms, Bailey reiterated a line from his book: \"True acceptance of the transgendered requires that we truly understand who they are.\"\n\nBailey and his work were featured prominently in a \"Boston Globe\" story by Neil Swidey entitled \"What Makes People Gay?\" That story was included in the 2006 volume of \"The Best American Science Writing.\"\n\nBailey and his lab were also prominent in the CBS News \"60 Minutes\" story \"Gay or Straight?,\" which first aired on March 12, 2006 and was the most popular news story on the CBS News website the following week. This story provoked reactions ranging from \"fantastic and fascinating\" by gay author Jeremy Hooper at the Good As You blog to negative comments from gay author David Ehrenstein, who noted the show was \"replete with the sort of clichés about gay men and effeminacy that haven’t been seen in a network news context since the 1967 CBS broadcast .\" Shari Finkelstein, the producer of the \"Gay or Straight\" segment, responded: \"We were aware of the controversy surrounding Michael Bailey's book, and we looked into all the allegations before we decided to interview him for the story...\" She concluded: \"We didn't feel there was anything that disqualified him from being interviewed. And in fact, his work is highly regarded by all of the researchers in the field who we spoke with, and we felt that he was a very worthy person to discuss these issues.\"\n\nIn 2011, Bailey's human sexuality class at Northwestern made the headlines of major news organizations after he allowed a female guest speaker and her male partner to perform an impromptu live mechanized sex toy demonstration using a \"fucksaw\"—a modified reciprocating saw converted into a sex toy by attaching a \"phallic object\" instead of a blade—to bring the woman to orgasm in front the audience. Students were advised beforehand of the nature of the demonstration in this optional after-class event on kinky sex and female orgasm. In the aftermath, Northwestern University President Morton Schapiro criticized Bailey for \"extremely poor judgment\" and launched an investigation. Bailey at first defended the demonstration, saying that students found lectures featuring guest speakers valuable, but subsequently issued an apology, saying he regretted the upset caused and its effect on the university's reputation. He said there would be no repeats, but maintained that the demonstration had been relevant to the topic of his course, and said that the students who chose to attend were over 18, \"legally capable of voting, enlisting in the military, and consuming pornography\", and contended that the criticism he had received was poorly reasoned. The response among academics was mixed. Joseph Epstein criticized Bailey's class as failing academic standards in a long piece for \"The Weekly Standard\", and ultimately compared Bailey to a pimp. In contrast, Laurie Essig, writing in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\", thought that the incident \"triggered a national conversation about what we can and cannot look at\". In a web-only feature for \"Esquire\", Bailey's former research assistant Paul Schrodt defended his teaching and research methods. Alice Dreger also defended Bailey's class as being of high quality in general, but agreed with Schapiro that the demonstration \"was a case of poor judgment, because it wasn't worth it\". Eventually, in response to the incident, Northwestern administrators removed Bailey's human sexuality course from the following year's curriculum. A year later, Northwestern reintroduced a somewhat differently themed sexuality class taught by Lane Fenrich, according to whom the new class emphasized \"the major questions\" and \"the major thinkers\" rather than being \"geared toward sexual practices\".\n\n\n\n"}

Recently, milder methods have been developed, including the use of lithium bromide as a catalyst and an improved procedure involving the use of microwave irradiation.\n\nWhat is now known as the Bischler-Möhlau Indole Synthesis was discovered and formulated through the separate, but complimentary, findings of German Scientist Richard Möhlau in 1882 and Russia-born German chemist August Bischler (with partner H. Brion) in 1892. These two researchers did not collaborate with each other, but instead independently developed very similar procedures starting from an aromatic ketone structure with an excess of some aniline and ultimately producing an product.

It was changed in 2003 to the Honda CR85R and subsequently to the Honda CRF150.\nSeveral changes were made throughout the years from being air-cooled to water-cooled and\ndifferent styling each year. The CR80R Expert started production in 1996. The machine was powered by a 2-stroke engine and utilised a 6-speed manual transmission.\n\nHonda launched the CR125M in 1973, branded as the \"20 Horsepower Feather\". Offered at a low price of $749, it had a top speed of 60 mph and was equipped with a two-stroke air cooled motor. It was a very popular motorcycle, and it dominated motocross for a while.\n\nIn, 1978 Honda launched the CR125 Red Rocket Elsinore; a rare bike very well built equipped with a 6-speed transmisson, it can be recognized by the expansion chamber on the front of the cylinder where the exhaust is to be attached.\n\nThe CR250M Elsinore began selling in 1973. It had a two-stroke engine and was one of the first of its class, and set the standard for two-stroke motorcycle development. In 1974 and 1975, the CR250M design changed little. In 1978, Honda revised the CR250M and renamed it the CR250R, the R standing for race. In 1981, Honda introduced a new suspension. The 1984 model had a new hydraulic front disc brake, and a new exhaust valve. Between then and 1990 the CR250R had minor changes such as hydraulic rear brake, Showa front suspension, and a bigger carburetor.\n\nIn 1992, the CR250R was given a newer, more aggressive design, but a disadvantage was the amount of power the new engines were producing in relation to the weak steel frame. Many riders advised Honda to change the frame to something stronger; but successful riders who were sponsored by Honda such as Jeremy McGrath and Ronnie Mac only the screaming eagle preferred the old stiff weak frame. In 1997, the aluminum frame was introduced. Many racers liked this frame but the bike was not selling to casual desert riders, so Honda undertook a redesign and in 2000 introduced an improved aluminum frame. In 2002, the only real change was the bike was made way faster and lighter and the electronic power valve and third-generation aluminum frame. The Honda CR250 had a liquid-cooled single-cylinder engine that produced about 45 hp. It had a five-speed transmission with Showa suspension and a two-gallon fuel tank. In 2007, Honda announced that they would produce no more two-strokes after that year.\n\nThe CRM 250 was a 2 stroke trail bike made from 1989 to 1999.\n\n\nThe CR500 was first produced in 1984. The CR500 had a air-cooled two-stroke engine that produced 60.8hp, the most powerful motocross bike that Honda had ever produced. The CR500 raced in long desert rallies like the Baja 500 and the Baja 1000. The CR500 was discontinued in 2001, and replaced by the four-stroke CRF450. Although the CRF450 was slightly heavier than the CR500 it had a modern twin-spar aluminium frame.\n\nThe 1985 CR500 was the first year being water-cooled.\n"}

To combat them, the Terrestrial Defense Force establishes the Ultra Garrison, a team of six elite members who utilize high-tech vehicles and weaponry. Joining their fight is the mysterious Dan Moroboshi who is secretly an alien from the Land of Light in Nebula M-78 and transforms into his true alien form, Ultraseven, in times of crisis.\n\nAfter the success of space-themed science fiction shows such as \"Ultraman\", \"Captain Ultra\", and the Japanese broadcast of \"Lost in Space\", Tokyo Broadcasting System pursued Tsuburaya Productions to produce another sci-fi series. This led Eiji Tsuburaya to assemble Hajime Tsuburaya, Akio Jissoji, Tetsuo Kinjo, Masami Sueyasu, and Shoji Otomo to brainstorm ideas.\n\nEiji Tsuburaya proposed a series that would have been a hybrid of \"Thunderbirds\" and \"Lost in Space\", Hajime proposed a new \"Ultraman\" series that would have included network and sponsors' input for each season, Jissoji proposed a time-travel themed show which would have focused on a time patrol team and their families, Kinjo proposed a children's horror/mystery show that would have been a hybrid of \"Ultra Q\" and \"The Twilight Zone\", Sueyasu proposed a fairy tale-themed series, and Otomo proposed a space-themed series which would have been a cross of \"Lost in Space\" and \"Men into Space\" featuring giant monsters.\n\nTBS eventually settled on a fusion of Eiji's and Otomo's ideas and Eiji submitted a treatment titled \"The Ultra Garrison\", which featured six trained astronauts (including an android named \"John\") stationed on a satellite called \"Mother\", the first line of defense against alien invaders. Kinjo felt that the idea was lacking an essential element and suggested adding a superhero.\n\nThe treatment underwent massive revisions after TBS felt the idea was too similar to \"The Great Space War\" and the new version included giant monsters while retaining the original Earth Defense Force element at TBS' request. TBS eventually suggested to make the series a direct sequel to \"Ultraman\" and have it focused on Hayata and Fuji's son, who would be able to call upon Earth monsters for help and only transform into Ultraman in times of desperation.\n\nTetsuo Kinjo began working on an outline, combining elements of TBS' best ideas and his own, such as elements from his rejected proposal \"Woo\", which featured an alien unwittingly becoming a savior of mankind. Kinjo's outline was titled \"Ultra Eye\" and featured Dan Moroboshi being the son of a human and an alien, with Dan coming to Earth in search of his mother. This version also featured Capsule Monsters that Dan would have used when he could not transform. Originally, monsters from \"Ultra Q\" and \"Ultraman\" were going to be used as the Capsule Monsters in order to cut down production costs.\n\nTohru Narita was assigned to design the aliens, monsters, and vehicles. Narita's design for Ultra Seven was inspired by Mayan culture and originally chose silver and blue for the colors, but changed them to silver and red to avoid problems with the blue-screen matte process.Principal photography on the special effects began in May 1967 and casting began in June 1967. Many of the actors hired were chosen from Toho's acting pool, since the studio was one of the financial investors for Tsuburaya Productions. Yoji Hashimoto and Toshimichi Miwa were put in charge of duties with TBS for the show, while Eiji Tsuburaya served as the chief producer and supervisor for the show and Masami Sueyasu reprised his role as a hands-on producer for Tsuburaya Productions.\n\nFour episodes were completed before copyright was approved for the show's title, which was changed to \"Ultra Seven\". The show was filmed silent, a common practice for Japanese shows at the time, and post-production, including editing and voice dubbing, began in September 1967. Toru Fuyuki was hired to compose the soundtrack, gearing towards a more classical direction as opposed to the jazz-inspired direction Kunio Miyauchi took for the \"Ultraman\" soundtrack.\n\n\"Ultra Seven\" aired on October 1, 1967 and earned a 33.7% rating, an achievement at the time. Due to the show's high ratings, TBS ordered an additional 10 episodes during preparations for the show's third \"Cours\" (episodes 27-39). Despite ratings dropping during the final weeks, \"Ultra Seven\" still remained in the top five highest rated shows in Japanese television at the time.\n\nSequels for both \"Ultraman\", titled \"Ultraman Continues\", and \"Ultra Seven\", titled \"Fight! Ultra Seven\", were proposed, but Tsuburaya Productions would not produce another \"Ultra Series\" TV show until 1971, with \"The Return of Ultraman\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1985, Turner Program Services licensed the series in a 15-year contract from Tsuburaya Productions, who provided the English dubbed versions produced in Honolulu by Tsuburaya-Hawaii, Inc. in the mid-1970s. Finding this English version to be lacking, Turner commissioned the Canadian children's programming production house, Cinar, to dub all 49 episodes for run in syndication. The TPS/Cinar produced episodes featured new opening and closing credits, eyecatches, new episode names, and even a change of name for the character of Anne Yuri, who was dubbed as \"Donna Michibata\". Cinar edited the episodes for violence, language and commercial time and featured new music cues.\n\nUnsatisfied with Cinar's resultant work, Turner put the series into their vaults until 1994, when they were alerted that the episodes were never broadcast. \"Ultra Seven\" was dusted off for the \"Toons 'Til Noon\" and \"MonsterVision\" blocks on TNT. The \"Toons 'Til Noon\" broadcasts received substantially heavy editing to make them suitable for the time slot, while the \"MonsterVision\" broadcasts were the full-length Cinar adaptations. Episodes 3 and 5-7 were missing or mislabeled and were never broadcast. Clips from the series were later used in the \"Messages from Space\" segments on the animated variety show \"Cartoon Planet\", which aired on TBS and Cartoon Network. When the contract expired in 2001, Turner returned all the materials (film elements, videotapes, audio masters) to Tsuburaya Productions.\n\nThe 12th episode, titled \"From Another Planet with Love\", was banned due to Alien Spell (which had keloid scars) being labeled as \"Hibaku Seijin\" (A-Bomb Survivor Alien) which was lifted from the term \"hibakusha\", referring to the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The issue was featured on an article of the \"Asahi Shimbun\" newspaper, which sparked public outrage and forced Tsuburaya Productions to change the name to \"Kyuketsu Seijin\" (Vampire Alien). Despite this, Tsuburaya Productions still received negative public opinion and as a result, Tsuburaya pulled the alien character and episode from official publications, broadcasts and home media releases. However, the Hawaiian English dub and Cinar dub of the series broadcast the episode (which was re-titled \"Crystallized Corpuscles\") in North America.\n\nIn December 2012, Shout! Factory licensed the series from Tiga Entertainment Co., LTD and released the series on DVD for the first time in North America. This release only included the Japanese original with English subtitles and did not contain the banned 12th episode, \"From Another Planet with Love\". Bandai Visual released the series on Blu-ray in Japan as two separate sets with the first released on November 21, 2014 and the second on January 28, 2015. In September 2019, Mill Creek Entertainment announced plans to release the original Japanese version of \"Ultra Seven\" on Blu-ray and Digital in North America on December 10, 2019 in standard and steelbook releases.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2184839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184839", "title": "Animal Boy", "text": "Animal Boy\n\nAnimal Boy is the ninth studio album by American punk band the Ramones, released through Sire Records on May 19, 1986. Due to conflicts within the group, the album features less of lead singer Joey Ramone, both in performing and writing, and less performing from guitarist Johnny Ramone. Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote and sang more on this album than on previous albums, and Richie Ramone became the first drummer to write songs for the band since Tommy Ramone, the band's original drummer. The album spawned four singles, all of which charted on the UK Singles Chart, as well as other charts. In addition to singles, the band promoted their album using a music video for \"Something to Believe In,\" which parodied the contemporary benefit concert Live Aid and Hands Across America.\n\nLyrical themes of the album range from band members' frustrations with one another, themselves, and loved ones, to more politically themed songs—a rarity in Ramones music. \"My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes To Bitburg)\" saw the Ramones criticizing U.S. President Ronald Reagan for his controversial visit to a military cemetery in Bitburg, Germany, despite Johnny Ramone disagreeing with the song's message. Critically, \"Animal Boy\" was not nearly as acclaimed as its predecessor, \"Too Tough to Die\", receiving generally mixed reviews. Critics were quick to point out that the band had strayed far from their original style and were experimenting with several genres by this point. However, the album charted in four different countries, including the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nBy 1985, there was a considerable amount of conflict between band members. Lead singer Joey Ramone went so far as to withdraw from the writing process, after having been a vital part of it on previous records. Joey recalled: \"I'd had it with the Ramones. 'Mental Hell' is about that. Part of it came from breaking up with [then girlfriend] Angela. The other part of it was that I had really had it with the band.\" In later interviews, however, Joey stated that it was not the conflict that made him stop writing, but rather that he'd had \"ideas on the backburner.\" Bassist Dee Dee Ramone claimed guitarist Johnny Ramone was the reason for much of the stress, alleging that Johnny did not want to do songs Joey wrote for multiple reasons: \"Joey will present a great tune and Johnny won't do it because it's this or it's that. 'I'm not going to play minor chords. I'm not going to play lead. I'm not going to come to England.' For God's sake! That's why Joey gotta do his solo album.\"\n\nConsequently, the somewhat recently added drummer Richie Ramone stepped up to the writing process, resulting in the hit song \"Somebody Put Something in My Drink,\" released as a single and later appearing on the band's first compilation album, \"Ramones Mania\" (1988). \"Joey was always encouraging me to write songs,\" explained Richie, \"but I didn't really need the encouragement.\" This would be the first time the band featured the drummer as a songwriter since original drummer Tommy Ramone, with Joey reasoning that he wanted to make Richie feel like a part of the band; he felt past drummers had not been so much a part of the band, nor any good at writing, and called Richie a \"regular Phil Collins.\" Johnny would later say the album needed better production quality, commenting that the guitar moments did not sound like he had performed them. \"The producer on [\"Animal Boy\"], Jean Beauvoir,\" Johnny related, \"was selected by the label, not us.\"\n\nFor the album's front cover, the band wanted to take a photo with a monkey from the Bronx Zoo. George DuBose originally took the picture in the zoo's monkey house, but this photo was rejected by the zoo director. The zoo would not allow the band to borrow a chimp for photographing, so DuBose decided to try hiring Zippy the Chimp, a baby chimpanzee who had appeared on \"Late Night With David Letterman\" and was successful. The resulting idea was to take the picture of the band standing in front of a gorilla cage with Punk Magazine founder Legs McNeil in a gorilla costume. Richie is holding Zippy, and DuBose had to refrain from flashing light so as not to frighten it. However, according to DuBose, the chimp was already out of control. \"Zippy was getting wild,\" Dubose recalled. \"He wasn't looking at the camera and was fucking around with the guys. I wasn't getting the picture because the chimp was out of control, so finally the trainer goes up to Zippy and whacks him across the face.\" The lack of flash resulted in a lowlighted, warmer colored photograph, which would be used as the album's cover.\n\nIn addition to touring, Sire Records and Beggars Banquet Records in the UK released four singles to help promote the album in hopes of receiving more radio airplay. The first single from \"Animal Boy\" was \"My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg),\" issued by Beggars Banquet in June 1985. \"Go Home Anne\" was the B-side, produced by Ed Stasium and mixed by Lemmy Kilmister, lead singer of Motörhead. There were multiple explanations given for why the single was not released in the United States: the product manager at Sire Records explained that it was both a \"financial and political\" decision, while the parent company, Warner Bros. Records, claimed that \"It just wasn't considered a good enough record.\" The single's jacket cover depicted President Reagan giving a speech at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp before going to Bitburg, but the image was removed from later pressings. British newspaper \"Melody Maker\" claimed it was removed because the band received pressure from \"Moral Majority, the Patriotic League of the Alamo, and the SS.\"\n\nThe music video for \"Something to Believe In\" was a parody of both the Live Aid benefit concert and Hands Across America. The video was described by author Everett True to be \"reassuringly foolish\" and \"a welcome return to [the Ramones'] old sense of humor.\" Several guests are featured in the video, including The B52s, Weird Al Yankovic, Spinal Tap, Ted Nugent, The Circle Jerks, Toni Basil, Rodney Bingenheimer, Holly Beth Vincent, and Afrika Bambaataa. Because the music video was praised by Warner Bros., they released \"Something to Believe In\" as a double A-side with \"Somebody Put Something in My Drink.\" \"Something to Believe In\" was also released with \"Animal Boy\" in the United States and \"Crummy Stuff\" in the UK through Beggars Banquet.\n\n\"Animal Boy\" featured a range of genres and musical elements that were completely new to the band and had not been featured on previous albums. Frequent use of synthesizers, as well as minimalistic \"gimmicky\" lyrics, caused critics and fans to feel as though the Ramones had strayed far away from their early, raw punk sound, despite \"Animal Boy\"s predecessor \"Too Tough Too Die\" being acclaimed for the band returning to their roots. \"The main problem with \"Animal Boy\",\" explained author Everett True, \"was that there was no longer one discernible Ramones sound: it sounds as disjointed as the band members probably felt. The guitar parts could've been played by anyone, and Richie's drumming was slipping away from Tommy's original template. The Ramones were turning into a 9-5 job, night not day.\"\nThe album begins with Joey singing \"Somebody Put Something in My Drink,\" written by Richie, who stated that he came up with the lyrics while he was dating Frankie Valli's daughter and mistakenly drank after someone else in a nightclub. \"Rolling Stone\" editor David Fricke described Joey's vocal performance in the song as an \"exaggerated wino growl while Johnny crushes the chord changes with his trash-compactor guitar.\" \"Animal Boy\" and \"Apeman Hop\" were compositionally similar to \"Cretin Hop\" from 1977's \"Rocket To Russia,\" but were described by True to be \"a thousandth as good.\" \"Love Kills\" was inspired by the Alex Cox biopic \"Sid and Nancy\" (also known as \"Sid and Nancy: Love Kills\"). The lyrics relate that the couple will never be able to win with drugs, despite the fact that the song's writer himself, Dee Dee, would later succumb to a heroin overdose. \"Animal Boy\"s fifth track, \"She Belongs to Me,\" is a ballad written by Dee Dee and Beauvoir regarding unrequited love, and features heavy use of synthesizers, while earlier albums would have used a soft acoustic guitar or occasionally strings for ballad-type songs. Side A of the album concludes with \"Crummy Stuff,\" played in a pop punk style, with repetitive lyrics based on the band's past of being chaotic and never meeting expectations.\n\nSide B begins with one of the band's only politically based songs, \"My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg).\" The lyrics encapsulated the feelings of Joey, Dee Dee and Beauviour while watching US President Ronald Reagan visit a military cemetery in Bitburg, West Germany to pay tribute to the victims of Nazism. In an interview with \"East Coast Rocker\", Joey explained: \"What Reagan did was fucked up. Everybody told him not to go, all his people told him not to go, and he went anyway. How can you fuckin' forgive the Holocaust? How can you say, 'Oh well, it's OK now?' That's crazy!\" Dee Dee also asserted that Johnny had made the band seem right winged. \"It was the first time we could make a statement to show we weren't prejudiced,\" he explained. \"We'd just had these skinheads at our gigs, punks walking around wearing swastikas.\" Johnny disliked the song and refused to play the song live, saying that Reagan was his favorite president of his lifetime.\n\n\"Mental Hell,\" the next track and the second written by Joey, dealt with his recent stress with the band and his relationship with his girlfriend, Angela, ending. Author Dave Thompson described \"Eat That Rat\" as \"reaching back to their pure punk past.\" While \"Eat That Rat\" is one minute and thirty-seven seconds long, the shortest track on the album is the next song, \"Freak of Nature,\" which clocks in at one minute and thirty-two seconds. Johnny explained that it was written by him and Dee Dee while changing reels in an open-reel audio tape recording at the studio. \"Hair of the Dog,\" a piece about the guilt of alcoholism, is the third and final song written by Joey. The album's last track, \"Something to Believe In,\" was influenced heavily by British pop, and was described by Susan Cummings of \"Spin\" as a \"pseudo-AOR attempted teen anthem\" and by author Scott Schnider as a \"surging, yearning anthem.\"\n\nThe album received mixed reviews from critics. Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a \"B+\" and considered both \"She Belongs to Me\" and \"Crummy Stuff\" to be \"defensive-sounding,\" but called \"Something to Believe In\" an anthem and praised \"My Head Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg).\" \"Rolling Stone\" critic David Fricke deemed the album a \"reductionist masterpiece\" that \"proves they still have a lot more to give,\" claiming that it rivaled previous albums \"Leave Home\" and \"Rocket to Russia\". \n\nEduardo Rivadavia, editor for AllMusic, later criticized the album for using more modern commercial conventions and for its heavy use of synthesizers and keyboards in an attempt to reinvent the band's style. Rivadavia specifically pointed to \"Somebody Put Something in My Drink,\" which he claimed \"wastes an aggressive vocal performance from Joey Ramone by supporting it with a shamelessly polished synthesizer backing track,\" and referred to \"Something to Believe In\" as \"unbearably soft.\" He concluded that the album had been a \"career low\" for the Ramones, but still rated it three out of five stars. \n\nIn the United States, the album entered the \"Billboard\" 200 on June 21, 1986 at #146, and rose to #143 the following week. Despite staying on the chart for six weeks, the album's peak position did not rise above #143. It entered the UK Album Charts on May 31, 1986, where it stayed for two weeks and reached a peak position of #38. The album entered the Canadian charts on June 7, 1986 at #96, moving up to #94 a week later. The album returned to position #96 on June 21, leaving the chart on July 12. On June 11, it entered the Swedish Sverigetopplistan charts, where it remained on the chart for one week at #37.\n\nTrack listing adapted from the \"Animal Boy\" liner notes.\n\nAll information credited to Allmusic except where noted.\n\nRamones\n\nProduction and additional musicians\n\n\n\n"}

It is found only on the island of Tasmania. The long-tailed mouse is an omnivore that feeds on insects and a range of plants. It is found in forested areas, particularly in sub-alpine scree, and may live in burrows.\n\nThe species reaches a weight of about 70 grams. It is distinguished from other species by its two-tone tail, which is white on the underside and dark above. The tail is 1.3 times longer than the head and body combined. It is stipulated that \"P.higginsi\" uses its tail for balance while leaping in habitat such as boulder screes.\n\nFossils of this species have been found in Cloggs Cave, Buchan in eastern Victoria and were identified by palaeontologist Jeanette Hope. The date for the remains based on C-14 dating were between 12-20,000 years old.\n\nThe long-tailed mouse ranges from sea level to approximately 1,200 m. and seems to prefer habitats that offer high rainfall, such as wet forests. It is a habitat generalist which is resilient to environmental modifications. In a study of short-term responses of native rodents to various logging styles in old growth wet Eucalyptus forests, it was found that the long-tailed mouse was equally abundant across all forestry treatments and was positively correlated to reduced ground cover.\n\nAnother study found that significantly greater numbers of long-tailed mouse were found in wet disturbed forests and that logging and harvesting did not effect the diversity of the local ecosystem.\nA conservational study conducted in 2012 was able to compare the historical range of the long-tailed mouse to its current range to determine if this helped predict the risk of extinction. Reduced geographic range size is often a strong predictor of species decline. It was shown that despite modern habitat loss, the long-tailed mouse is less threatened than would be expected from just the loss of its historical habitat ranges.\n\nThe long-tailed mouse is an opportunistic generalist omnivore whose diet is seasonal and varies with local availability. Using fecal analysis, it was found to consume a wide range of plant matter, such as grasses, grains, bamboo, fruits, ferns, and mosses. It was also found to consume fungi and insects of wide varieties.\n\nThe long-tailed mouse is a primarily nocturnal mammal but can also be active during the day. It is found primarily in rainforest, wet scrub, eucalyptus scrub, sedgeland, and low alpine vegetation.\n\nRelevant abundance of the long-tailed mouse is correlated to several other species in its habitat. \"Lazenby et.al.\" was able to show across four independent sample areas that the abundance of the long-tailed mouse was correlated positively to swamp rats (\"Rattus lutreolus velutinus\") and negatively correlated to feral cats (\"Felis catus\"). Tasmanian devils were also shown to have a negative effect on the long-tailed mouse and all other small mammal populations surveyed in this study.\n\nThe long-tailed mouse breeds seasonally from September through June Gestation generally lasts approximately 31–33 days, with an average litter of 3 young. Young become fully independent 33 days after birth and reach adult size at approximately 40 days. The tail will continue to grow until they are approximately 75 days old. There is no significant sexual dimorphism in this species. However, there is some geographic variation in the species concerning overall body weight, hind foot length, and tail length.\n\nAs a mammal, \"P.higginsi\" nurses their young from shortly after birth until weaning. The young fasten themselves to the nipples, which allow for the mother to take evasive actions when necessary.\n"}
{"id": "2184861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184861", "title": "Hyperemesis gravidarum", "text": "Hyperemesis gravidarum\n\nHyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a pregnancy complication that is characterized by severe nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and possibly dehydration. Feeling faint may also occur. It is considered more severe than morning sickness. Symptoms often get better after the 20th week of pregnancy but may last the entire pregnancy duration.\nThe exact causes of hyperemesis gravidarum are unknown. Risk factors include the first pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, obesity, prior or family history of HG, trophoblastic disorder, and a history of eating disorders. Diagnosis is usually made based on the observed signs and symptoms. HG has been technically defined as more than three episodes of vomiting per day such that weight loss of 5% or three kilograms has occurred and ketones are present in the urine. Other potential causes of the symptoms should be excluded, including urinary tract infection and an overactive thyroid.\nTreatment includes drinking fluids and a bland diet. Recommendations may include electrolyte-replacement drinks, thiamine, and a higher protein diet. Some women require intravenous fluids. With respect to medications, pyridoxine or metoclopramide are preferred. Prochlorperazine, dimenhydrinate, or ondansetron may be used if these are not effective. Hospitalization may be required. Psychotherapy may improve outcomes. Evidence for acupressure is poor.\nWhile vomiting in pregnancy has been described as early as 2,000 BC, the first clear medical description of HG was in 1852 by Paul Antoine Dubois. HG is estimated to affect 0.3–2.0% of pregnant women. While previously known as a common cause of death in pregnancy, with proper treatment this is now very rare. Those affected have a lower risk of miscarriage but a higher risk of premature birth. Some pregnant women choose to have an abortion due to HG symptoms.\n\nWhen vomiting is severe, it may result in the following:\n\nSymptoms can be aggravated by hunger, fatigue, prenatal vitamins (especially those containing iron), and diet. Many women with HG are extremely sensitive to odors in their environment; certain smells may exacerbate symptoms. Excessive salivation, also known as sialorrhea gravidarum, is another symptom experienced by some women.\n\nHyperemesis gravidarum tends to occur in the first trimester of pregnancy and lasts significantly longer than morning sickness. While most women will experience near-complete relief of morning sickness symptoms near the beginning of their second trimester, some sufferers of HG will experience severe symptoms until they give birth to their baby, and sometimes even after giving birth.\n\nA small percentage rarely vomit, but the nausea still causes most (if not all) of the same issues that hyperemesis with vomiting does.\n\nThere are numerous theories regarding the cause of HG, but the cause remains controversial. It is thought that HG is due to a combination of factors which may vary between women and include genetics. Women with family members who had HG are more likely to develop the disease.\n\nOne factor is an adverse reaction to the hormonal changes of pregnancy, in particular, elevated levels of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG). This theory would also explain why hyperemesis gravidarum is most frequently encountered in the first trimester (often around 8–12 weeks of gestation), as β-hCG levels are highest at that time and decline afterward. Another postulated cause of HG is an increase in maternal levels of estrogens (decreasing intestinal motility and gastric emptying leading to nausea/vomiting).\n\nAlthough the pathophysiology of HG is poorly understood, the most commonly accepted theory suggests that levels of β-hCG are associated with it. Leptin, a hormone that inhibits hunger, may also play a role.\n\nPossible pathophysiological processes involved are summarized in the following table:\nHyperemesis gravidarum is considered a diagnosis of exclusion. HG can be associated with serious problems in the mother or baby, such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, coagulopathy and peripheral neuropathy.\n\nWomen experiencing hyperemesis gravidarum often are dehydrated and lose weight despite efforts to eat. The onset of the nausea and vomiting in hyperemesis gravidarum is typically before the 20th week of pregnancy.\n\nDiagnoses to be ruled out include the following:\nCommon investigations include blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and electrolytes, liver function tests, urinalysis, and thyroid function tests. Hematological investigations include hematocrit levels, which are usually raised in HG. An ultrasound scan may be needed to know gestational status and to exclude molar or partial molar pregnancy.\n\nDry bland food and oral rehydration are first-line treatments. Due to the potential for severe dehydration and other complications, HG is treated as an emergency. If conservative dietary measures fail, more extensive treatment such as the use of antiemetic medications and intravenous rehydration may be required. If oral nutrition is insufficient, intravenous nutritional support may be needed. For women who require hospital admission, thromboembolic stockings or low-molecular-weight heparin may be used as measures to prevent the formation of a blood clot.\n\nIntravenous (IV) hydration often includes supplementation of electrolytes as persistent vomiting frequently leads to a deficiency. Likewise, supplementation for lost thiamine (Vitamin B) must be considered to reduce the risk of Wernicke's encephalopathy. A and B vitamins are depleted within two weeks, so extended malnutrition indicates a need for evaluation and supplementation. In addition, electrolyte levels should be monitored and supplemented; of particular concern are sodium and potassium.\n\nAfter IV rehydration is completed, patients typically begin to tolerate frequent small liquid or bland meals. After rehydration, treatment focuses on managing symptoms to allow normal intake of food. However, cycles of hydration and dehydration can occur, making continuing care necessary. Home care is available in the form of a peripherally-inserted central catheter (PICC) line for hydration and nutrition. Home treatment is often less expensive and reduces the risk for a hospital-acquired infection compared with long-term or repeated hospitalizations.\n\nA number of antiemetics are effective and safe in pregnancy including: pyridoxine/doxylamine, antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine), and phenothiazines (such as promethazine). With respect to effectiveness, it is unknown if one is superior to another for relieving nausea or vomiting. Limited evidence from published clinical trials suggests the use of medications to treat hyperemesis gravidarum.\n\nWhile pyridoxine/doxylamine, a combination of vitamin B and doxylamine, is effective in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, some have questioned its effectiveness in HG.\n\nOndansetron may be beneficial, however, there are some concerns regarding an association with cleft palate, and there is little high-quality data. Metoclopramide is also used and relatively well tolerated. Evidence for the use of corticosteroids is weak; there is some evidence that corticosteroid use in pregnant women may slightly increase the risk of cleft lip and cleft palate in the infant and may suppress fetal adrenal activity. However, hydrocortisone and prednisolone are inactivated in the placenta and may be used in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum after 12 weeks.\n\nWomen not responding to IV rehydration and medication may require nutritional support. Patients might receive parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding via a PICC line) or enteral nutrition (via a nasogastric tube or a nasojejunal tube). There is only limited evidence from trials to support the use of vitamin B to improve outcome. An oversupply of nutrition (hyperalimentation) may be necessary in certain cases to help maintain volume requirements and allow weight gain. A physician might also prescribe Vitamin B (to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy) and folic acid.\n\nAcupuncture (both with P6 and traditional method) has been found to be ineffective. The use of ginger products may be helpful, but evidence of effectiveness is limited and inconsistent, though three recent studies support ginger over placebo.\n\nIf HG is inadequately treated, anemia, hyponatremia, Wernicke's encephalopathy, kidney failure, central pontine myelinolysis, coagulopathy, atrophy, Mallory-Weiss tears, hypoglycemia, jaundice, malnutrition, pneumomediastinum, rhabdomyolysis, deconditioning, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, splenic avulsion, or vasospasms of cerebral arteries are possible consequences. Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder are common secondary complications of HG and emotional support can be beneficial.\n\nThe effects of HG on the fetus are mainly due to electrolyte imbalances caused by HG in the mother. Infants of women with severe hyperemesis who gain less than during pregnancy tend to be of lower birth weight, small for gestational age, and born before 37 weeks gestation. In contrast, infants of women with hyperemesis who have a pregnancy weight gain of more than 7 kilograms appear similar to infants from uncomplicated pregnancies. There is no significant difference in the neonatal death rate in infants born to mothers with HG compared to infants born to mothers who do not have HG. Children born to mothers with undertreated HG have a fourfold increase in neurobehavioral diagnoses.\n\nVomiting is a common condition affecting about 50% of pregnant women, with another 25% having nausea. However, the incidence of HG is only 0.3–1.5%. After preterm labor, hyperemesis gravidarum is the second most common reason for hospital admission during the first half of pregnancy. Factors, such as infection with \"Helicobacter pylori\", a rise in thyroid hormone production, low age, low body mass index prior to pregnancy, multiple pregnancies, molar pregnancies, and a past history of hyperemesis gravidarum have been associated with the development of HG.\n\nThalidomide was prescribed for treatment of HG in Europe until it was recognized that thalidomide is teratogenic and is a cause of phocomelia in neonates.\n\nHyperemesis gravidarum is from the Greek \"hyper-\", meaning excessive, and \"emesis\", meaning vomiting, and the Latin \"gravidarum\", the feminine genitive plural form of an adjective, here used as a noun, meaning \"pregnant [woman]\". Therefore, hyperemesis gravidarum means \"excessive vomiting of pregnant women\".\n\nAuthor Charlotte Brontë is often thought to have suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum. She died in 1855 while four months pregnant, having been afflicted by intractable nausea and vomiting throughout her pregnancy, and was unable to tolerate food or even water.\n\nCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge was hospitalised due to hyperemesis gravidarum during her first pregnancy, and was treated for a similar condition during the subsequent two.\n\nComedienne Amy Schumer cancelled the remainder of a tour due to hyperemesis gravidarum.\n"}
{"id": "2184884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184884", "title": "Jewish political movements", "text": "Jewish political movements\n\nJewish political movements refer to the organized efforts of Jews to build their own political parties or otherwise represent their interest in politics outside the Jewish community. From the time of the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans to the foundation of Israel the Jewish people had no territory, and, until the 19th century they by-and-large were also denied equal rights in the countries in which they lived. Thus, until the 19th century effort for the emancipation of the Jews, almost all Jewish political struggles were internal, and dealt primarily with either religious issues or issues of a particular Jewish community. (See Judaism and politics.)\n\nSince Jews were excluded as outsiders throughout Europe, they were mostly shut out of politics or any sort of participation in the wider political and social sphere of the nations in which they were involved until the Enlightenment, and its Jewish counterpart, Haskalah, made popular movements possible. As long as the Jews lived in segregated communities, and as long as all avenues of social intercourse with their gentile neighbors were closed to them, the rabbi was the most influential member of the Jewish community. In addition to being a religious scholar and clergy, a rabbi also acted as a civil judge in all cases in which both parties were Jews. Rabbis sometimes had other important administrative powers, together with the community elders. The rabbinate was the highest aim of many Jewish boys, and the study of the Torah (first five books of the Bible) and the Talmud was the means of obtaining that coveted position, or one of many other important communal distinctions. Haskalah followers advocated \"coming out of the ghetto\", not just physically but also mentally and spiritually. The example of Moses Mendelssohn (1729–1786), a Prussian Jew and grandfather of the composer Felix Mendelssohn, served to lead this movement. Mendelssohn's extraordinary success as a popular philosopher and man of letters revealed hitherto unsuspected possibilities of integration and acceptance of Jews among non-Jews.\n\nThe changes caused by the Haskalah movement coincided with rising revolutionary movements throughout Europe. Despite these movements, only France, Britain, and the Netherlands had granted the Jews in their countries equal rights with gentiles after the French Revolution in 1796. Elsewhere in Europe, especially where Jews were most concentrated in Central and Eastern Europe, Jews were not granted equal rights. It was in the revolutionary atmosphere of the mid-19th century that the first true Jewish political movements would take place.\n\nDuring the early stages of Jewish emancipation movements, Jews were simply part of the general effort to achieve freedom and rights that drove popular uprisings like the Revolutions of 1848. Jewish statesmen and intellectuals like Heinrich Heine, Johann Jacoby, Gabriel Riesser, Berr Isaac Berr, and Lionel Nathan Rothschild were active with the general movement towards liberty and political freedom.\n\nStill, in the face of persistent anti-semitic incidents like the Damascus Blood Libel of 1840, and the failure of many states to emancipate the Jews, Jewish organizations started to form in order to push for the emancipation and protection of Jews. The Board of Deputies of British Jews under Moses Montefiore, the Central Consistory of Paris, and the Alliance Israelite Universelle founded by Adolphe Crémieux, all began working to assure the freedom of the Jews throughout the middle of the 19th century.\n\nFrustration with the slow pace of Jewish acceptance into European society, and a revolutionary utopianism, led to a growing interest in proto-socialist and communist movements, especially as early socialist leaders, like Saint-Simon, preached the emancipation of the Jews. Moses Hess played a role in introducing Karl Marx (who was descended from a long line of rabbis) and Friedrich Engels to historical materialism. The Jewish Ferdinand Lassalle, founded the first actual workers' party in Germany, the General German Workers' Association (which ultimately merged with other parties to become the Social Democratic Party of Germany) and made Jewish emancipation one of his goals. \n\nThe more intellectual socialist movements of the Jews in Western Europe never gathered steam as emancipation took hold. In Eastern Europe and Russia, however, the \"Bund\"the General Jewish Labor Unionfounded in 1897, became a key force in organizing Jews, and, at least initially, the major opponent of another Jewish political movement of the time, Zionism. There were other Jewish socialist parties in Russia, like the (territorialist) Zionist Socialist Workers Party and the Jewish Socialist Workers Party, which united their destinies in 1917 as the United Jewish Socialist Workers Party. Another left-wing Russian Jewish party was the Jewish Social Democratic Labour Party (Poalei Zion).\n\nThe aim of Zionism was to set up a secular state in the vicinity of the Biblical Land of Israel. Zionism, or the idea of a restored national homeland and common identity for the Jews, had already started to take shape by the mid-19th century, with Jewish thinkers such as Moses Hess whose 1862 work \"Rome and Jerusalem; The Last National Question\" argued for the Jews to settle in Palestine as a means of settling the national question. Hess proposed a socialist state in which the Jews would become agrarianised through a process of \"redemption of the soil\" which would transform the Jewish community into a \"true\" nation, in that Jews would occupy the productive layers of society rather than being an intermediary non-productive merchant class, which is how he perceived Jews in Europe. Hess, along with later thinkers such as Nahum Syrkin and Ber Borochov, is considered a founder of \"Socialist Zionism\" and Labour Zionism and one of the intellectual forebears of the kibbutz movement. Others like Rabbi Zvi Kalischer viewed a return to the Jewish homeland as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy through natural means.\nAs the 19th century wore on, the persecution of the Jews in Eastern Europe where emancipation had not occurred to the extent it did in Western Europe (or at all) increased. Starting with the state-sponsored massive anti-Jewish pogroms following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II, through the bloody pogroms of 1903 to 1906 who left thousands of Jews dead and many more wounded, continuing with the Dreyfus Affair in France in 1894, Jews were profoundly shocked to see the continuing extent of anti-Semitism from Russia to France, a country which they thought of as the home of enlightenment and liberty.\n\nIn reaction to the first, Judah Leib Pinsker published the pamphlet Auto-Emancipation on January 1, 1882. The pamphlet became influential for the \"Political Zionism\" movement. The movement was to achieve momentum under the leadership of an Austrian-Jewish journalist, Theodor Herzl, who published his pamphlet \"Der Judenstaat\" (\"The Jewish State\") in 1896. Prior to the Dreyfus Affair, Herzl had been an assimilationist, but after seeing how France treated its loyal Jewish subjects, he proposed building a separate Jewish state. In 1897 Herzl organized the First Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland, which founded the World Zionist Organisation (WZO) and elected Herzl as its first President. After the state's establishment Zionism, in its various forms, would become the largest Jewish political movement, although more Jews would participate in the national politics of the countries in which they resided.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1905 pogroms in Russia, the historian Simon Dubnow founded the Folkspartei (Yiddishe Folkspartay) which had some intellectual audience in Russia, then, in independent Poland and Lithuania in the 1920–1930s where it was represented as well in the Parliaments (Sejm, Seimas) as in numerous municipal councils (incl. Warsaw) till in the late 1930s. The party did not survive the Shoah, the Holocaust.\n\nThe territorialists, who had split from the Zionists after the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905, called for creation of a sufficiently large and compact Jewish territory (or territories), not necessarily in the Land of Israel and not necessarily fully autonomous. Some territorialist leaders, such as Nachman Syrkin, supported the Socialist versions of Zionism, while some others, such as Lucien Wolf, actively opposed Zionism and promoted anti-nationalist ideas. Isaac Nachman Steinberg, one of the founders of the Freeland League, held anti-authoritarian socialist views, as well as his close friend Erich Fromm, who supported Steinberg's territorialist ideas.\n\nWhile the Jews in general played an important role in the international anarchist movements, many Jewish anarchists actively promoted Yiddish language and culture, focused on specifically Jewish issues. While most Jewish anarchists were irreligious or even vehemently anti-religious, some Jewish anarchist and anti-authoritarian thinkers, such as Martin Buber, rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, Isaac Nachman Steinberg and Gustav Landauer, were religious or religiously inclined and often referred to the Torah, Talmud and other traditional Judaic sources, claiming that anarchist ideas are deeply rooted in the Jewish tradition. The Jewish anarchists believe that in the stateless, free and diverse anarchist society the Jews would have more opportunities to express their individual and cultural autonomy. Many Jewish anarchists, while promoting universal internationalist values, had actively participated in the development of the Yiddish culture and Jewish community life. \n\nThere was some intersection between the Jewish anarchist, Folkist and Territorialist movements. For example, Isaac Nachman Steinberg, a renowned Territorialist leader, held anarchist views. Most Jewish anarchists supported anarcho-syndicalism and communist anarchism, while a few were individualist anarchists. The small contemporary anarchist movement in Israel is very active in peace and Palestinian solidarity actions.\n\nZionism continues to be the central trans-national political movement of most Jews, although it has split into a variety of branches and philosophies that span the political spectrum from left-wing to right-wing. Jews are also active in government in many of the countries in which they live, as well as in Jewish community organizations that often take political positions.\n\nIn the 20th century, Jews in Europe and the Americas traditionally tended towards the political left, and played key roles in the birth of the labor movement as well as socialism. While Diaspora Jews have also been represented in the conservative side of the political spectrum, even politically conservative Jews have tended to support pluralism more consistently than many other elements of the political right. Daniel J. Elazar connects this pluralist tendency to the fact that Jews are not expected to proselytize, and argues that whereas Christianity and Islam anticipate a single world-state, Judaism does not. This lack of a universalizing religion is combined with the fact that most Jews live as minorities in their countries, and that no central Jewish religious authority has existed for over 2,000 years. \"(See list of Jews in politics, which illustrates the diversity of Jewish political thought and of the roles Jews have played in politics.)\"\n\nThere are also a number of Jewish secular organizations at the local, national, and international levels. These organizations often play an important part in the Jewish community. Most of the largest groups, such as Hadassah and the United Jewish Communities, have an elected leadership. No one secular group represents the entire Jewish community, and there is often significant internal debate among Jews about the stances these organizations take on affairs dealing with the Jewish community as a whole, such as antisemitism and Israeli policies. In the United States and Canada today, the mainly secular United Jewish Communities (UJC), formerly known as the United Jewish Appeal (UJA), represents over 150 Jewish Federations and 400 independent communities across North America. Every major American city has its local \"Jewish Federation\", and many have sophisticated community centers and provide services, mainly health care-related. They raise record sums of money for philanthropic and humanitarian causes in North America and Israel. Other organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Congress, American Jewish Committee, American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Zionist Organization of America, Americans for a safe Israel, B'nai B'rith and Agudath Israel represent different segments of the American Jewish community on a variety of issues.\n\nThe 21st century has brought changes in the political leanings of Jewish communities in the diaspora. In the U.S. and Canada, the two largest Jewish diaspora communities, voters are shifting from liberal to more conservative leanings. in 2011 an Ipsos Reid exit poll of voters in the federal election of Canada found that 52 per cent of Jewish voters supported the Conservatives, 24 per cent the Liberals and 16 per cent the NDP, reflecting \" an enormous shift in voter preference among Canadian Jews.\" The shift appears to reflect an alignment with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing coalition government and its views on Israel's security. The Jewish community in Great Britain is also leaning conservative in the 21st century as a poll published by the Jewish Chronicle in early 2015 shows. Of British Jews polled, 69% would vote for the Conservative Party, while 22% would vote for the Labour Party. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the voter population, which according to a BBC poll had Conservatives and Labor almost tied at about a third each. Jews have typically been a part of the British middle class, traditional home of the Conservative Party, though the number of Jews in working class communities of London is in decline.

It is now mostly obsolete, and is largely relegated to the realm of literature and fantasy role-playing, although individual terms continue to be used in the criminal subcultures of both Britain and the United States. Its South German and Swiss equivalent is the \"Rotwelsch\", its Dutch equivalent is \"Bargoens\" and the Serbo-Croatian equivalent is \"Šatrovački\".\n\nIt was claimed by Samuel Rid that thieves' cant was devised around 1530 \"to the end that their cozenings, knaveries and villainies might not so easily be perceived and known\", by Cock Lorel and the King of the Gypsies at The Devil's Arse, a cave in Derbyshire. It does seem to have originated in this period, but the story is almost certainly a myth.\n\nCant was a common feature of rogue literature of the Elizabethan period in England, in both pamphlets and Elizabethan theatre. Thomas Harman, a justice of the peace, included examples in his \"Caveat for Common Cursitors\" (1566). He collected his information from vagabonds he interrogated at his home in Essex. He also called it \"pedlars' French\" or \"pelting speech\", and was told that it had been invented as a secret language some 30 years earlier. The earliest records of canting words are included in \"The Highway to the Spitalfields\" by Robert Copland c. 1536. Copland and Harman were used as sources by later writers. A spate of rogue literature started in 1591 with Robert Greene's series of five pamphlets on cozenage and coney-catching. These were continued by other writers, including Thomas Middleton, in \"The Black Book\" and Thomas Dekker, in \"The Bellman of London\" (1608), \"Lantern and Candlelight\" (1608), and \"O per se O\" (1612). Cant was included together with descriptions of the social structure of beggars, the techniques of thieves including coney-catching, gull-groping, and gaming tricks, and the descriptions of low-life of the kind which have always been popular in literature.\n\nHarman included a canting dictionary which was copied by Thomas Dekker and other writers. That such words were known to a wide audience is evidenced by the use of cant words in Jacobean theatre. Middleton and Dekker included it in \"The Roaring Girl, or Moll Cut-Purse\" (1611). It was used extensively in \"The Beggars' Bush\", a play by Francis Beaumont, John Fletcher and Philip Massinger, first performed in 1622, but possibly written c. 1614. The play remained popular for two centuries, and the canting section was extracted as \"The Beggars Commonwealth\" by Francis Kirkman as one of the drolls he published for performance at markets, fairs and camps.\n\nThe influence of this work can be seen from the independent life taken on by the \"Beggar King Clause\", who appears as a real character in later literature. The ceremony for anointing the new king was taken from Thomas Harman and described as being used by Gypsies in the nineteenth century. Bampfylde Moore Carew, who published his picaresque \"Life\" in 1745, claimed to have been chosen to succeed \"Clause Patch\" as King of the Beggars, and many editions of his work included a canting dictionary. Such dictionaries, often based on Harman's, remained popular, including \"The Canting Academy, or Devils Cabinet opened\", by Richard Head (1673), and BE's \"Dictionary of the Canting Crew\" (1699).\n\nSome words from thieves' cant continued to be used into the twentieth century combined with slang words from eighteenth century London.\n\nIn June 2009 it was reported that inmates in one English prison were using \"Elizabethan cant\" as a means of communication that guards would not understand, although the words used are not part of the canon of recognised cant.\n\nIn 2015 British an experimental folk group called Dead Rat Orchestra recorded versions of songs in thieves' cant as compiled by J. S. Farmer in his \"Musa Pedestris\".\n\nThese formed part of a soundtrack created for artist filmmaker James Holcombe's film Tyburnia, and were presented live as part of a show about Secret Languages on BBC Radio 3's \"The Verb\", hosted by Ian McMillan.\n\nIt was commonly believed that cant developed from Romany. Etymological research now suggests a substantial correlation between Romany words and cant, and equivalents, in many European languages. However, in England, Scotland, and Wales this does not apply. The \"Egyptians\", as they were known, were a separate group from the standard vagabonds, and cant was fully developed within 50 years of their first arrival in England. Comparison of Gypsy words in the Winchester Confessions taken in 1616 with modern Welsh Romany show high commonality. This record also distinguished between Gypsy and Cant words and again the attributions of the words to the different categories is consistent with later records.\n\nThere is doubt as to the extent to which the words in canting literature were taken from street usage, or were adopted by those wishing to show that they were part of a real or imagined criminal underworld. The transmission has almost certainly been in both directions. The Winchester Confessions indicate that Gypsies engaged in criminal activities, or those associated with them and with a good knowledge of their language, were using cant, but as a separate vocabulary - Angloromani was used for day to day matters, while cant was used for criminal activities. A thief in 1839 claimed that the cant he had seen in print was nothing like the cant then used by gypsies, thieves and beggars. He also said that each of these used distinct vocabularies, which overlapped; the Gypsies having a cant word for everything, and the beggars using a lower style than the thieves.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The 683 species are in 63 genera and 11 subfamilies, which is the largest number of genera of any frog family.\n\nA molecular phylogenetic study by van der Meijden, et al. (2007) has estimated the initial internal divergence of the family Microhylidae to have taken place about 66 million years ago, or immediately after the Cretaceous extinction event. The most recent common ancestor of the Microhylidae and their closest ranoid relatives is estimated to have lived 116 million years ago in Gondwana.\n\nAs suggested by their name, microhylids are mostly small frogs. Many species are below in length, although some species are as large as . They can be arboreal or terrestrial, and some even live close to water. The ground-dwellers are often found under leaf litter within forests, occasionally venturing out at night to hunt. The two main shapes for the microhylids are wide bodies and narrow mouths and normal frog proportions. Those with narrow mouths generally eat termites and ants, and the others have diets typical of most frogs. Egg-laying habits are highly varied.\n\nThe microhylids of New Guinea and Australia completely bypass the tadpole stage, with direct development from egg to frog. The arboreal species can therefore lay the eggs within the trees, and never need venture to the ground. Where species do have tadpoles, these almost always lack the teeth or horny beaks typical of the tadpoles of other families.\n\nThe skull has paired palatines and frontoparietals. The facial nerve passes through the anterior acoustic foramen in the auditory capsule; the trigeminal and facial nerve ganglia are fused to form a prootic ganglion. The eight (or seven) presacral holochordal vertebrae are all procoelous except for a biconcave surface on last presacral. The pectoral girdle is firmisternal and some show reduced clavicle and procoracoids. The terminal phalanges are blunt, pointed, or T-shaped. The tadpole lacks keratinized mouth parts and has a large spiracular chamber emptied by a caudomedial spiracle.\n\n\nFrogs from the Microhylidae occur throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of North America, South America, Africa, eastern India, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Australia. Although most are found in tropical or subtropical regions, a few species can be found in arid or nontropical areas.

Designed by Werner Stengel, it is a second-generation Impulse model manufactured by Intamin. The ride was marketed as the tallest and fastest double-twisting impulse coaster in the world when it opened to the public on May 5, 2002.\n\nConstruction on Wicked Twister started on October 15, 2001 when the Stadium Games, formerly the Aquarium, were razed. Wicked Twister was officially announced about a month later on November 20. During its marketing campaign, the ride was billed as the tallest and fastest double-twisting impulse coaster in the world. The first pieces of steel were erected on December 15 and the first piece of track was installed four days later. The first test run occurred on April 2, 2002.\n\nWicked Twister's media day was held on May 2, 2002 then it opened to the public on May 5. Additional supports were added to the ride's structure for the 2003 season. Two yellow supports were added to each spike to connect the track to the top of the main support structure.\n\nAt the beginning of the ride, the linear induction motors propel the train forward out of the station during its first launch at , which carries the train approximately halfway up the front tower. After coming to a stop, the train falls and enters the LIM section again, where the train is accelerated during its second launch to in the backward direction so that the train climbs halfway up the rear tower. The train then stops and drops forward before re-entering the LIM section where additional thrust is added as the train gains to during its third launch, causing the train to reach its highest point on the front tower. Stopping and reversing, the train drops and re-enters the LIM section where the LIM launches the train for the fourth time, making the train reach a maximum speed of to travel a maximum of up the rear tower. With the one more final pass forward through the LIM section, the train goes up the front spike once more before the train reverses. As it travels back toward the station, the brakes are applied and it stops within the station platform. Unlike other Inverted roller coasters, there is no floor in the loading station that drops out underneath the train. Riders must climb into their seats when loading.\nWicked Twister consists of two tall spikes. Both ends of the towers (track) are designed with 450-degree vertical twists which is the main difference between Wicked Twister and other Inverted Impulse roller coasters. Between the towers, a horizontal track section incorporates the load and unload area as well as the linear induction motor propulsion system. The ride was built directly on the Cedar Point Beach with its entrance plaza being in the former Aquarium location. The track is painted yellow with teal supports.\n\nThe ride features one train that consists of eight cars. Riders are arranged two across in two rows for a total of 32 riders. Wicked Twister's theme song is \"The Winner\" by the Crystal Method.\n\nWicked Twister has many additional safety systems installed because it passes the station multiple times, and at high speeds.\nThe first of these systems is a \"light curtain\", named for the nature in which it operates. Two emitters and two receivers are placed on each side of the ride station. Each emitter sends a thick, invisible beam of light towards the receiver on the other side. If at any time this beam is broken during ride operation, it will automatically emergency stop.\nA second safety system is installed under the station, attached to the automatic platform gates. If an individual places too much downward vertical force, or shakes the gates, the ride emergency stops. \nA third safety system is located on all other gates on the ride, including entrance and exit. The gates are electromagnetically sealed while the ride is in progress, to ensure guests do not enter.\nAfter the 2009 season a fourth safety system was installed on the train that wirelessly communicates with the light curtain mentioned above that can stop the train anywhere on the launch/brake section of the track when the light is broken.\n\n\n"}

Some literature claims two subspecies, but a recent paper rejects this.\n\nThe pig-nosed turtle is unlike any other species of freshwater turtle. The feet are flippers, resembling those of marine turtles. The nose looks like that of a pig, having the nostrils at the end of a fleshy snout, hence the common name. The carapace is typically grey or olive, with a leathery texture, while the plastron is cream-coloured. Males can be distinguished from females by their longer and narrower tails. Pig-nosed turtles can grow to about carapace length, with a weight of over .\nUnlike the soft-shelled turtles of the family Trionychidae, pig-nosed turtles retain a domed bony carapace beneath their leathery skin, rather than a flat plate. They also retain a solid plastron, connected to the carapace by a strong bony bridge, rather than the soft margin of the trionychids.\n\nPig-nosed turtles are not completely aquatic. Little is known about their general behaviour, as there have been few studies in the wild. Their known extreme aggression in captivity suggests the species is markedly more territorial than most other turtles and tortoises. They seem to display a degree of social structure during the cooler dry season around the hydrothermal vents that line some river systems they inhabit.\n\n\"C. insculpta\" is omnivorous, eating a wide variety of plant and animal matter, including the fruit and leaves of figs, as well as crustaceans, molluscs and insects.\n\nFemales of \"C. insculpta\" reach maturity at 18 or more years, and males around 16 years. They lay their eggs late in the dry season on sandy river banks. When the offspring are fully developed, they will stay inside the eggs in hibernation until conditions are suitable for emergence. Hatching may be triggered when the eggs have been flooded with water or by a sudden drop in air pressure signaling an approaching storm.\n\nUsing environmental triggers, along with vibrations created by other hatching turtles in the same clutch, gives a better chance for survival. Using a universal trigger rather than simply waiting for incubation to finish means they all hatch at the same time. This provides safety in numbers; also, the more turtles that hatch, the more help they have to dig through the sand to the surface.\n\n\"C. insculpta\" is native to freshwater streams, lagoons and rivers of the Northern Territory of Australia, as well as to the island of New Guinea, where it is believed to occur in all the larger, and some smaller, southward-flowing rivers.\n\n\"C. insculpta\" experienced a population decline of more than 50% in the thirty years between 1981 and 2011. Although the turtles are protected in Indonesia under Law No. 5/1990 on Natural Resources and Ecosystems Conservation, smuggling occurs. Some 11,000 turtles captured from smugglers were released into their habitats in the Wania River, Papua Province, Indonesia, on 30 December 2010. In March 2009, more than 10,000 turtles retrieved from smugglers were also released into the Otakwa River in Lorentz National Park. 687 pig-nosed turtles were seized at an Indonesian airport in March 2013. They were reportedly destined for Hong Kong.\n\nPig-nosed turtles have become available through the exotic pet trade, with a few instances of captive breeding. While juveniles are small and grow slowly, their high cost and large potential size makes them suitable only for experienced aquatic turtle keepers. They tend to be shy and prone to stress. They get sick easily, which can cause problems with their feeding, but they are known to eat commercially available processed turtle pellets or trout chow, as well as various fruits and vegetables. Breeding is rarely an option to the hobbyist, as adults are highly aggressive and will attack each other in all but the largest enclosures.\n\nWild populations of this turtle are declining rapidly because of illegal capture for the pet trade. It is estimated that between 2003 and 2013, more than 80,000 individuals were confiscated in 30 seizures in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.\n\n\n"}

Indeed, ABLV has now been isolated from five different bat species, all four species of Pteropodidae in Australia and from an insectivorous bat species, the yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat (\"Saccolaimus flaviventris\"), with two distinct lineages apparently circulating in insectivorous and frugivorous bats (Fraser \"et al\"., 1996; Gould \"et al\"., 1998, 2002; Guyatt \"et al\"., 2003). Phylogenetically and serologically, ABLV isolates appear to be more closely related to RABV than any of the other Old World lyssaviruses (Fig. 2). Although the black flying fox is a native fruit bat to Australia and is present on islands to the north, ABLV has only been isolated in Australia. However, serosurveillance of bat populations in the Philippines has suggested that lyssavirus infection of bats might be more widespread than previously thought (Arguin \"et al\"., 2002).\n\nThree cases of ABLV in humans have been confirmed, all of them fatal. The first occurred in November 1996, when an animal caregiver was scratched by a yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat. Onset of a rabies-like illness occurred 4–5 weeks following the incident, with death 20 days later. ABLV was identified from brain tissue by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.\n\nIn August 1996, a middle aged woman in Queensland was bitten on the finger by a flying fox while attempting to remove it from a child on whom it had landed. Six months later, following heightened public attention from the first ABLV death, she consulted a GP regarding testing for the virus. Postexposure treatment was advised, but for an unknown reason did not occur. After a 27-month incubation, a rabies-like illness developed. The condition worsened after hospital admission, and she died 19 days after the onset of illness. On the day the woman was hospitalized, cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and saliva were submitted for testing. On the fourth day of her hospital admission, these tests were returned with results of probable ABLV infection. Postmortem tests were all strongly positive for ABLV. The length of incubation is unusual as classical rabies has typical incubation periods less than 90 days.\n\nIn December 2012, an eight-year-old boy was bitten or scratched by a bat in north Queensland. He became ill three weeks later, and died on 22 February 2013.\n\nRabies vaccine and immunoglobulin are effective in prophylactic and therapeutic protection from ABLV infection. Since the emergence of the virus, rabies vaccine is administered to individuals with a heightened risk of exposure and vaccine and immunoglobulin are provided for postexposure treatment.\n\nABLV is one of four zoonotic viruses discovered in pteropid bats since 1994, the others being Hendra virus, Nipah virus, and Menangle virus. Of these, ABLV is the only virus known to be transmissible to humans directly from bats without an intermediate host.\n\nDr John Carnie [Victoria's Chief Health Officer] said Australian bat lyssavirus was a rare but fatal disease that could be transmitted to humans or pets bitten or scratched by bats. But he said only two cases have ever been recorded, both in Queensland. No animal or person in Victoria has ever contracted the disease, Dr Carnie said. Nine Victorian flying foxes have been found with the virus since 1996. \"Under no circumstances should people handle flying foxes on their property as some diseases they carry, such as Australian bat lyssavirus, are transmissible to humans,\" Dr Carnie said in a statement. Only trained volunteers or workers should handle bats. Anyone who encounters a sick or injured flying fox should not try to catch it but call the DSE Customer Service Centre on 136 186.\n\nABLV was detected in a bat found in the Melbourne suburb of Kew in July 2011. The discovery prompted health authorities to issue warnings to Melbourne residents not to touch the creatures.\n\nABLV was confirmed in two horses on Queensland's Darling Downs in May 2013. Both horses were euthanased when their condition deteriorated despite treatment and the attending veterinarian performed a \"post mortem\" examination obtaining samples that allowed for the laboratory diagnosis. The property was then quarantined. Three dogs and the four horses in closest contact received postexposure prophylaxis, as did all nine in-contact people. The virus was isolated and identified as the insectivorous bat strain. These cases have prompted reconsideration of the potential spillover of ABLV into domestic animal species. Veterinarians are urged to consider ABLV as a differential diagnosis in cases of progressive generalized neurological disease.\n\n\n"}

It had name changes before becoming the Austin Hospital.\n\nDuring World War II, two military hospitals were located at the site - the 115th Australian General Hospital, operated by the Australian Army, between 13 March 1941 and 19 May 1947, and the 6th RAAF Hospital, operated by the Royal Australian Air Force, between 1942 and 1947.\n\nThe Australian Army handed over the military hospital to the Repatriation Commission on 19 May 1947, and the hospital then became known as the \"Repatriation General Hospital Heidelberg\". The Repatriation Commission (Department of Veterans' Affairs) operated the hospital until 31 December 1994. In the decade leading up to transfer of the hospital to the state hospital system the name was modified to its current name - \"Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital\".\n\nThe Austin Hospital was transferred into the Victorian health system on 1 January 1995, with Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital and Austin Hospital amalgamating on 1 April 1995 to become the \"Austin & Repatriation Medical Centre\" - \"Victoria’s largest tertiary referral centre providing a broad range of patient services whilst enhancing established teaching and research profiles\".\n\nIn 1996 plans by the Victorian State Government of Jeff Kennett to privatise the hospital were leaked to the press. There was much community disquiet over this decision, and confidential reports on the privatisation were withheld from public scrutiny. Most hospital staff opposed this plan, but being bound by confidentiality agreements dared not speak out publicly fearing for their own jobs. The Labor Party pledged its opposition to the privatisation proposal. With the surprise election in 1999 of Steve Bracks, a minority Labor Government was formed with the support of three Independents. Immediately, privatisation plans for the hospital were shelved, and funding increased.\n\nIn August 2000 the Victorian Government announced the redevelopment of the Austin Hospital and incorporating the relocation of the Mercy Hospital for Women (MHW) from East Melbourne to Heidelberg. This public project was the largest hospital redevelopment ever undertaken in Victoria, and one of the largest in Australia, costing $376 million.\n\nOn 30 April 2003, the Austin changed its name from the \"Austin & Repatriation Medical Centre\" (A&RMC) to \"Austin Health\". In January 2005, Dr Brendan Murphy was appointed CEO, and on 7 May 2005, the Mercy Hospital for Women fulfilled a long term plan and finally opened at Heidelberg.\n\nThe hospital provides the only Victorian wide service for acute spinal injuries, liver transplant and is the state referral centre for toxicology. It has a Statewide psychiatry unit for young children (under 12), the Eagle Child Unit (now called Statewide Child Unit). The Victorian Respiratory Support Service (VRSS) is also located at Austin Hospital. The treatment of cancer is particularly important with the most comprehensive cancer service in the Southern Hemisphere with the largest Positron Emission Tomography (PET) service in Victoria. Cancer research based at the hospital is conducted by Ludwig Cancer Research. Austin Hospital is one of two major teaching hospitals in Melbourne which maintain a filmless radiology department using PACS.\n\nThe hospital maintains one of the busiest Thoracic Surgical Units in Australia and also offers an extensive rehabilitation service at the Royal Talbot Rehabilitation Centre in Kew.\n\nThe University of Melbourne Departments of Medicine, Surgery, Psychiatry, Psychology and Physiotherapy are based with \"Austin Health\", with other tertiary institutions affiliated including Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, and La Trobe University for allied health programs. Teaching and training is also offered to students from Monash University, Deakin University, Swinburne University of Technology, Victoria University of Technology and the Australian Catholic University.\n\nOther research institutes affiliated with the Austin Health include the National Stroke Research Institute (NSRI), neurosciences research with the Brain Research Institute (BRI), epilepsy research with the Epilepsy Research Institute (ERI), Australian Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health, and the Biological Research Laboratory (BRL) which is a commercial supplier of animals for research establishments.\n\nThe Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre is based on the Austin Heidelberg site. It was first opened in 2012 as the result of a combination of government and philanthropic support, as well as donations from 200,000 members of the public totalling $17 million. On January 1, 2015 the former Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research based at the ONJ centre was closed and renamed the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute.\n\n"}

Established on March 6, 1941, it borders on Qashqadaryo Region internally, and Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan externally, going anticlockwise from the north. It covers an area of 20,100 km². The population is estimated at 1,925,100 (end of 2005 data), with 80% living in rural areas. According to official data, 83% of the population are Uzbeks and 1% Tajiks, but non-official statistics show Surxondaryo is a Persian-speaking area, because most Tajiks of Uzbekistan are concentrated in the Surxondaryo, Samarkand and Bukhara regions. The highest point of the Region and also of Uzbekistan is Khazrati Sulton peak reaching 4,643 m/15,233 ft in Gissar Range.\n\nThe regional capital is Termez with population of 122,900 and the second largest city is Denov (Denau) with 69,500 inhabitants (data for 2005). Other towns include Boysun, Jarkurghon, Kumkurghon, Shargun, Shirabad, Shurchi, and Sariosiyo.\n\nThe climate is continental, with mild wet winters and hot dry summers. The southern part of the region is in the Badkhiz-Karabil semi-desert ecoregion (PA0808), characterized by a savanna of pistachio and desert sedge. The northern portion is characterized by open woodlands (Gissaro-Alai open woodlands ecoregion, PA1306), with characteristic plants being pistachio, almond, walnut, apple, and juniper. Sagebrush is common at lower elevations \n\nNatural resources include petroleum, natural gas, and coal. Light industry, mainly cotton ginning and food processing, is also an important part of the regional economy, particularly in the production of consumer goods. Agriculture is based primarily on cotton and cereals, supplemented with horticulture and viticulture. Surxondaryo is the country's largest supplier of long-fiber cotton. Livestock accounts for 40% of regional agricultural product. The climatic conditions of this region also make it possible to cultivate subtropical crops such as sugarcane.\n\nThe region has a well-developed transport infrastructure, with 300 km of railways and 2,700 km of surfaced roads. Central Asia's only river port is located at Termez on the Amudarya River.\n\nBitter debates accompanied the Soviet allocation of Surkhandarya Region to the Uzbek SSR rather than the Tajik SSR in 1929, as that region, as well as the areas of Bukhara and Samarkand, had sizable, if not dominant, Tajik populations.\n\nThe region is divided into 14 districts (tumans):\nAgriculture accounts for 42% of total employment in Surxondaryo Region and produces 8% of Uzbekistan’s agricultural output. Agricultural production is 56% crops and 44% livestock (like the country’s average). Milk yields are less than 1,700 kg per cow per year, on a par with the national average.\n\nMain characteristics of agriculture in Surxondaryo Region\n\n"}

The site was originally a landfill. The city park was dedicated in 1983.\n\nThe city of Mountain View bought the site in 1967 to build a recreational facility. However, the cost of importing earth to raise it by 20 feet in order to prevent flooding was too high, so it was instead operated as a landfill accepting garbage from San Francisco. Shoreline Park opened in 1983, with some initial problems from methane fires. In 1987, Shoreline won the League of California Cities' Helen Putnam Award for public works. \n\nShoreline Park now features an 18-hole links-style golf course with pro shop and driving range, Shoreline Golf Links, and a artificial lake. On the lake's eastern shore is the Shoreline Aquatic Center, which offers sailboat, windsurfing, kayak, canoe, rowboat, and pedalo rentals, as well as sailing, windsurfing, and kayaking classes. The adjacent Shoreline Cafe is open daily and offers a variety of food to lake goers. Shoreline Amphitheatre is next to the golf course. The Rengstorff House, a historic Victorian mansion moved to the park from its original location elsewhere in Mountain View, and Michaels at Shoreline Restaurant are also in the built-up area of the park.\n\nWalkers, runners, bike riders, et al., can enjoy miles of paved and unpaved trails, some of which are part of the San Francisco Bay Trail. A good description of a loop trip can be found here. The trails connect to the Stevens Creek Trail at the eastern edge of the park and the Palo Alto Baylands Nature Preserve on the western edge.\n\nThrough the developed park, one reaches a wildlife refuge at the edge of the bay, where many birds can be seen at almost any time.\n\nMeadowlands near the mouth of Permanente Creek in Shoreline Park provide critical remnant habitat for western burrowing owls (\"Athene cunicularia\"), a bird that has vanished from many counties in the Bay Area. The owl was listed as a Species of Special Concern (a pre-listing category under the Endangered Species Act) by the California Department of Fish and Game in 1979, and its Bay Area population continues to decline. In 2008, City of Mountain View evicted a pair of burrowing owls so that it could sell a parcel of land to Google to build a hotel at Shoreline Boulevard and Charleston Road. Eviction of the owls is controversial because suitable alternative habitat has vanished due to suburban sprawl. Development continued to encroach on the owls' habitat when, in 2010, the City of Mountain View approved Google's plan to build a 6.9-acre recreational park for its employees, so that they can play tennis, disc golf, shuffleboard and other activities on Google property that is part of the owls' foraging area. Although there were hundreds of burrowing owls in Santa Clara County when monitoring began in the 1980s, now there are only 35, with three breeding pairs raising ten eggs at Shoreline in 2011 (less than half the number of young in 2003).\n\n\n"}

He was a well-known composer at the close of the 15th century, was a principal contributor to the Chigi Codex, and was secretary to Guillaume Dufay.\n\nNothing is known about his life until 1451, when he became choirmaster at the church of St Vincent, Soignies, near Mons in Hainaut. This was an important musical establishment at the time, and several famous composers either worked there or trained there, including Gilles Binchois, who was probably an associate of Regis. The earliest datable music by Regis is preserved in the choirbooks of Cambrai Cathedral, between 1462 and 1465, indicating that he may have begun working there then.\n\nBetween 1464 and 1474 he served as secretary to Guillaume Dufay, and possibly lived in Cambrai for much of this time. Also in the early 1470s he was mentioned as one of the major composers of the time by the theorist Johannes Tinctoris, indicating the spread of his reputation.\n\nHe probably died in early summer 1496, since his post was declared vacant then, and eliminated.\n\nAlthough Regis was associated professionally with Guillaume Du Fay, his music is stylistically independent of Du Fay and is highly creative and technically innovative. Like his exact contemporary, Johannes Ockeghem, Regis liked to explore the low vocal register resulting in a very broad registral palette, and his music also evidences great harmonic and textural variety. Two masses, seven motets, and two secular songs, both rondeaux, by Regis have survived; some other music is mentioned by Tinctoris and other writers but is lost. One of his lost works is a \"Missa L'homme armé\"; dating from the 1450s; it is one of the earliest known masses based on this most popular of all tunes for mass composition. In addition to this lost mass, he wrote another based on the same tune, a \"Dum sacrum mysterium/Missa l'homme armé\"; this one has survived, and is a contrapuntal tour-de-force which uses up to three pre-existing melodies simultaneously in the four voices. Regis is one of the few composers known to have written more than one \"L'homme armé\" mass. Also among Regis' music for the mass is a single movement, \"Patrem Vilayge\".\n\nRegis' extended motet, \"Lux solemnis, Repleti sunt omnes\", features a lengthy passage of call and answer bicinia dialogue between the upper two voices and the lower two voices, foreshadowing this technique that was made famous in the following generation by Josquin. Regis is one of the first composers to have written for five voices, a standard grouping in the music of the next generation (for example, in the music of Josquin des Prez). Indeed, his motets for five voices seem to have been used by the next generation, including Loyset Compère, Gaspar van Weerbeke, Josquin, and Jacob Obrecht as models for their own work.\n\n"}

Mantz was killed in 1965 while flying a cobbled-together aircraft, the Tallmantz Phoenix P-1, designed with the assistance of Otto Timm, representing the fictional type built by oil explorers of pieces of their crashed Fairchild C-82 Packet downed in the North African desert in \"The Flight of the Phoenix (1965 version)\".\n\nTallman injured his leg in a go-cart accident with his small son in the driveway of their home, which meant Mantz had to fly the Phoenix. Tallman was hospitalized. Infection set in and most of the leg was amputated. Tallman taught himself to fly with one leg, reportedly preferring to fly some planes without the prosthetic leg he used for walking. As an amputee, he eventually regained his airman medical certificate and ratings in propeller multi- and single-engine, jet, and rotary aircraft.\n\nTallman performed the stunt flying in the 1963 chase movie \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\", including the flight in a Beechcraft Model 18 through a Coca-Cola billboard. He also contributed to \"The Carpetbaggers\" (1964), \"The Wrecking Crew\" (1969), and \"The Thousand Plane Raid\" (also 1969). \n\nHe served as the flying supervisor for \"Catch-22\" in 1970 and was personally involved in locating and acquiring the 18 or so flyable film unit B-25s appearing in the film. Tallman flew the dramatic night shots of the Milo Minderbinder Air Force B-25 bombing its own base just over the heads of actors Jon Voight and Martin Sheen.\n\nIn 1971, Tallman flew a Grumman J2F-6 Duck amphibian he restored in \"Murphy's War\". Also in 1971 Tallmantz Aviation provided the aerial camera footage for an episode of Columbo entitled \"Ransom For A Dead Man\". In 1973 he flew in \"Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies\" and piloted a Stearman cropduster in \"Charley Varrick\" along with the television pilot films \"Death Race\" and \"San Francisco International Airport\". He was aerial supervisor for \"The Great Waldo Pepper\" in which he performed barnstorming stunts. When the controls failed in his World War I aircraft replica, the plane went out of control and struck power lines. Tallman suffered a head injury. He also flew in \"Lucky Lady\", both in 1975. Tallman also served as aerial coordinator and pilot for the television series \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\" (1976–1979). He also flew in the six-episode TV series \"Spencer's Pilots,\" starring Gene Evans, and the television film, \"Amelia Earhart\", both in 1976.\n\nIn 1973, Tallman recounted his experiences rebuilding and flying vintage aircraft in the book \"Flying the Old Planes\".\n\nHis last film projects were \"The Cat from Outer Space\", \"Capricorn One\", and \"1941\", all in 1978.\n\nOn Saturday 15 April 1978, Tallman was making a routine ferry flight in a twin-engine Piper Aztec from Santa Monica Airport, California, to Phoenix, Arizona under visual flight rules when he continued the flight into deteriorating weather, a lowering ceiling and rain. He struck the side of Santiago Peak in the Santa Ana Mountains near Trabuco Canyon at cruising altitude, and died in the ensuing crash.\n\nFollowing Tallman's death, his historic collection of movie warplanes and camera planes was sold off. Many were purchased by entrepreneur Kermit Weeks and went on display at his Fantasy of Flight museum in Polk City, Florida. A Silver Line ship's model was donated to the Los Angeles Maritime Museum.\n\nHe was survived by his second wife, \"Boots\", his daughter Gail, and son, Frank.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2185121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2185121", "title": "Cyberia (video game)", "text": "Cyberia (video game)\n\nCyberia is a science fiction action adventure video game released for MS-DOS in January 1994, and released two years later on the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, 3DO and FM Towns consoles. A sequel, \"Cyberia 2: Resurrection\", was released in 1995 for both DOS and Windows 9x formats.\n\n\"Cyberia\" uses prerendered visuals during gameplay, and boasted impressive graphics for its time. While mostly linear, there are two points in the game where the player makes a decision that can change important outcomes. There are four basic methods of gameplay which \"Cyberia\" employs: exploring the environment through walking (from node to node), attempting to complete puzzles in a full screen view, using a gun turret to shoot down planes, and flying in various vehicles. Direction and speed during flight are computer controlled; the player controls weapons firing. Vehicles include the TF-22 Transfighter stealth jet, a nanotech virus cleaner, \"Charlie\" the remotely operated decontamination robot, and the Cyberia weapon itself.\n\nWeapons and methods of attack are few in the exploring sections of gameplay. Attached to Zak's suit is a heat pulse weapon that can be fired from Zak's arm. The only other modes of attack during the walking portions of the game consist of traps that must be set to outsmart an enemy, which goes hand-in-hand with the occasional demand for stealth. For the gun turret portion, two heat-charged energy blasts are released from each side of the turret when Zak fires it. When flying the stealth aircraft, Zak is able to dispense continuous bolts of blue energy at the cost of the aircraft's power supply. When controlling the virus cleaner, Zak is able to do likewise. The \"Charlie\" robot adds a new form of attack: a weapon which kills all enemies on the screen at the cost of a decent amount of the machine's energy. A similar electrical energy weapon seen on the virus cleaner is also used when Zak is joined with the Cyberia weapon.\n\nThe various puzzles in the game can range from requiring the player to figure out the password on a computer to disarming a bomb on a stealth aircraft. Zak can use his suit's BLADES (Bi-optic Low Amplitude Displayed Energy System) to scan the current puzzle in several ways for help in completing the puzzle. The three modes of Zak's BLADES are as follows:\n\nPuzzle difficulty and arcade difficulty are set in the beginning of the game, but setting both to \"easy\" is not permitted; if the player attempts to do so, the game will inform the player that it will be \"too easy.\" Arcade difficulty controls the toughness of the combat in the game (both on the ground and in the air).\n\nThe Saturn version of the game supports the mouse and mission stick in addition to the standard controller. The 3DO version supports only the standard controller and mission stick. The PlayStation version is one of the few games compatible with the PlayStation Mouse.\n\n\"Cyberia\" is set in the near future of the year 2027, five years after a global economic collapse. The world is under the dominion of two opposing superpowers, the First World Alliance in the west and the Cartel in the east. William Devlin, the leader of the FWA, receives word that a devastating weapon is being produced in a secret base in Siberia, referred to as the Cyberia Complex. Curious to unravel the mysteries of this weapon, Devlin pardons a cyber-hacker named Zebulon Pike \"Zak\" Kingston and charges him with the task of infiltrating the Complex and retrieving intel on the weapon being produced there.\n\nAlready getting wind of Cyberia's secret operations, the Cartel seizes control of the Complex with the same goal as the FWA–to discover the nature of the super weapon being produced by a third party. Zak is scheduled to rendezvous with an oil rig run by an FWA-contracted mercenary group managed by Luis Arturo Santos and his assistant Gia Scarlatti to pick up a TF-22 TransFighter, a sophisticated aircraft that will ensure Zak's arrival at the Cyberia Complex. Shortly after arriving the oil rig is attacked by the Cartel. After Zak and Gia defend the rig using gun turrets, the mercenaries, sensing betrayal, move to kill Zak by hunting him down and sabotaging the TF-22. Zak eventually steals the TF-22 and travels through several hostile locales en route to the Cyberia Complex; a mountain range infested with Cartel hoverfighters, a Cartel-run oceanlab, and a commuter tunnel are among the places visited by Zak. Eventually, the TF-22 reaches the Cyberia Complex and Zak proceeds to wreak havoc on the Cartel's analysis efforts.\n\nWhile exploring the Complex, Zak encounters more than Cartel soldiers, as he is forced to eradicate the Complex scientists experimental virus which killed some of the Cartel soldiers. After purging the virus from the Complex, Zak uncovers the Cyberion, an amorphous collection of miniature robots, or nanites, that has achieved sentience. Devlin then contacts Zak and informs him that the cyber-hacker himself is a weapon, which Cyberion explains to mean that a high-yield explosive device has been implanted into Zak's brain. Upon reaching the Cyberion, Devlin had intended to detonate the device from orbit, eliminating the weapon and killing Zak simultaneously. Zak, frustrated over Devlin's betrayal and upon Cyberion's suggestion, merges with the Cyberion which defuses the explosive device in Zak's head. Together, Zak and the Cyberion launch into space to confront Devlin in the FWA space station. The station's defenses are slowly crippled until the Cyberion and Zak make the final move and kill the treacherous Devlin by destroying the station. The resulting shockwave causes the Cyberion/Zak amalgamation to lose consciousness while it plummets to Earth. Upon crashing, an FWA retrieval team led by a Doctor John Corbin is heard hoisting up the remains of Cyberion/Zak into a helicopter.\n\nReviews for \"Cyberia\" were generally mixed. For the most part, the game's cinematic, prerendered visuals were lauded; according to Philip Jong of Adventure Classic Gaming, \"Cyberia\" was \"one of the first game titles to combine computer animations and Hollywood film technique to form visually stunning graphics and cut scenes.\" Similarly, IGN stated that the \"use of multiple camera angles, eerie soundtrack, detailed light-sourcing, and short, effective cut-sequences really pulls the player into the game.\" Radion Automatic of \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" likewise commented that \"the graphics remain stylistically constant pretty much throughout (apart from the ropey anti-aircraft concept), displaying solid-looking rendered characters and backgrounds in a cinematic enough fashion to carry the atmosphere.\" Scary Larry and Tommy Glide of \"GamePro\" both noted the excellent polygon rendering on the characters and the detailed backgrounds. A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" praised the rendered graphics, soundtrack, and \"absorbing\" storyline, and said that even with the very limited interactivity, \"\"Cyberia\" keeps itself above the competition by mixing sequences with puzzles and plot devices that keep the gamer drawn into the story\". \"Maximum\" complimented the \"slick metallic looking graphics\", though like Radion Automatic they found the graphics of the anti-aircraft sections unimpressive.\n\nDespite the praise over the game's aesthetics, reviewers found shortcomings in \"Cyberia's\" linear gameplay. In his review, Jong goes on to criticize the game's \"weak puzzles ... [that are] not well integrated into the story or gameplay.\" He concludes by saying that \"Cyberia\" is \"a classic example of beauty but no substance.\" In IGN's words, \"gameplay does tend to suffer in graphic adventures, which usually consists of doing things over and over until you do it right.\" Radion Automatic felt that the gameplay was enjoyable, but acknowledged that \"it's hard to think who to recommend it to. The role-play element isn't quite deep enough to appeal to solid adventure fans and the action is a bit too simple for super-speed cyber-shoot-'em-up heads.\" \"Maximum\" echoed these remarks: \"RPG purists will find this too shallow and action fans will find it too dull.\" They elaborated that the game tends to switch between gameplay styles abruptly, with no rhyme or reason, making it difficult to get involved with the game. Scary Larry complained of twitchy controls, and said that the game focuses too much on puzzle elements and not enough on action. Tommy Glide found the controls to be initially confusing and annoying, and said the game lacks replay value. One reviewer for \"Next Generation\" found the chief problem to be that Cyberia doesn't allow the player to explore and \"[create] your own story\", while another simply stated that \"it never achieves the level of interactivity that's required to make it a truly great game.\"\n\nReviews for the game showed little variation across the four different versions (PC, PlayStation, Saturn, and 3DO), and a \"Next Generation\" critic stated that the four versions are \"exactly\" alike.\n\n\"Cyberia 2: Resurrection\" was released in 1995 for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows as a sequel. It features the same gameplay as the original with improved 3D-rendered graphics and an increase in the amount of in-game cinematics.\n\nThe story picks up where the first game ended. After Zak and the Cyberia weapon crash land back on Earth following the destruction of Devlin's orbital headquarters, they are intercepted by an FWA team led by a Dr. Corbin. Corbin, under orders from his FWA employers, places Zak in cryo-storage and uses the remains of the Cyberia weapon to create a deadly virus called nano-toxin. Though the FWA seeks to quell a growing rebel movement with the nano-toxin, the maniacal Corbin intends to use it to kill millions and \"reshape the world as we know it.\" After three years in cryo-storage, Zak is thawed out by a renegade FWA major, and together the two of them set out to find Corbin and stop his plans.\n"}

When built in 1976, it was the first roller coaster in the world with 3 inversions. The coaster, which features Arrow's first vertical loop, was built during the same time period as The Great American Revolution at Magic Mountain. However, Revolution opened seven days prior and is therefore credited as the first modern-day coaster to feature a vertical loop.\n\nThe ride's station is located on the midway directly across from Top Thrill Dragster and next to Super Himalaya and near Power Tower. It was the first coaster to have inversions featuring a walkway underneath. \n\nCorkscrew originally had three 24 passenger trains painted red, white & blue, a color scheme inspired by the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976, the year the ride was introduced. The ride currently runs operates with two trains to reduce the excessive stacking on the brake run. Riders are restrained by over-the-shoulder restraints with interlocking seat belts and riders are required to be to ride. As the restraints cannot be unlocked by all cars at once, pedals are hinged on the backs of the cars to be manually released and locked individually by ride operators on the platform.\n\nThe train exits the station when the ride operator releases the pneumatic station brakes. The train reaches a slight decline that allows the car to roll out and around a 180 degree turnaround and ascends the 30-degree and 85-foot (26 m) chain lift hill, operating at a speed of . The train then descends at a 45-degree angle at a top speed of 48 mph (77 km/h). The train enters a bunny hop, drops lower than the main drop, and enters a vertical loop. The train goes a up to a short straightaway before descending a banked 180 degree right turn nto the two consecutive corkscrews over the midway of the park, traveling at . Lastly, the train enters a slight ascending right turn followed by a shallow left turn and then enters the brake run with trim and block brakes before returning back into the station.\n\nThe ride is long, consisting of blue tubular steel track with a separation between tubes, built on , rides for 1 minute and 40 seconds, and has three 24-passenger trains. Almost daily, a train is transferred off the track once ridership reaches a point that permits two-train operation with little or no waiting in line. A different train is cycled off each day. The ride was designed by Ron Toomer and built by Arrow Dynamics. The total cost of construction was , and the ride has had over 30 million total riders since opening in May 1976.\n\n"}

The story was penned by the duo following the rejection of previous scripts by the two men. Indeed, Ellis himself had seen his script ideas for “The Clock”, “The People Who Couldn't Remember” and “The Ocean Liner” all rejected. Their script “The Big Store” was also finally not commissioned despite extensive work, though some of the ideas about the substitution of people by replicas was taken further in \"The Faceless Ones\", with the scenario changed from a department store to an airport. \n\nDavid Ellis's other writing credits include Paul Temple, Spy Trap, and many episodes of \"Dixon of Dock Green\" in the 1960s and \"Z-Cars\" in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

{"id": "2185154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2185154", "title": "Mat Salleh Rebellion", "text": "Mat Salleh Rebellion\n\nThe Mat Salleh Rebellion was a series of major armed disturbances against the colonial British North Borneo Chartered Company administration in North Borneo, now the Malaysian state of Sabah. It was instigated by Datu Muhammad Salleh (also known as Mat Salleh), a local chief from the Lingkabo district and Sugut River. He led the rebellion between 1894 until his death in Tambunan in 1900. The resistance then continued on for another 5 years until 1905.\n\nHis revolts were widely supported by the local communities and affected a large geographical area from Sandakan, across Gaya Island, including the interior, especially Tambunan. His most notable uprising occurred at midnight on 9 July 1897, when he led his followers to successfully attack a major colonial settlement on Gaya Island.\n\nMat Salleh was born in Inanam. His father was Datu Balu, a traditional leader in Inanam and a member of the Suluk community. His mother was of Bajau descent. He had three siblings: Ali, Badin and Bolong. The family moved to Sugut, which unlike Inanam, was in the Company's concession but since the abandonment of its tobacco estates, it had reportedly been \"left largely to its own devices\", and enjoyed relative autonomy. There, Datu Bulu assumed a local leadership position along part of the Sugut River on the eastern coast of North Borneo.\n\nLater in his life, Mat Salleh married a Sulu princess named Dayang Bandang. She was related to the Sultan of Sulu's family and her village was at Penggalaban (), Paitan. He later inherited his father’s local leadership position as the village chieftain in the Lingkabau district and Sungei Sugut.\n\nMat Salleh was often physically described as slender and tall, with pockmarked features. He was also well known as a mysterious and intelligent man, with a commanding personality and presence. He was well-respected and his great tactical skills were renowned among the local communities.\n\nHis mixed parentage and role as a traditional local leader which he had inherited from his father contributed to his significant Bajau and Suluk following. Also, his marriage to Dayang Bandang, who was related to the ruling family in Sulu helped him win more supporters.\n\nHowever, his wide support not only came from his family affiliations and connections. He was also able to garner supporters from Kadazan-Dusun communities spread over a sizeable geographical area in Sabah and had the Tagahas communities as allies, among others. He was skilled at connecting with and uniting other communities, making him a great personage among the multi-ethnic indigenous people. For example, some accounts claim that he used and married various symbols of authority and mysticism that the different communities could relate with to attest to his leadership position and military prowess. \n\nThe large geographical areas where his support came from proved instrumental in ensuring the initial success of his revolt as these areas were available to provide power bases, supplies and construction of forts. This also implied that he and his army had ample mobility between forts and bases, which explains their successful repeated evasions of the Company’s troops. From 1895–1897, he had at his disposal at least six forts which were well-prepared with resources and manpower that he could mobilise at short notice.\n\nThe forts that his followers built were impressively very well designed and constructed. They were reportedly to have been the:-\n\nBefore the arrival of the British, central authority in Sabah was weak. Part of it was governed by Brunei and part by the Sulu government. This gave local chiefs and traditional elites relative autonomy to practice influence and power to regulate trade in the area and serve the responsibility of protecting the local inhabitants from excessive exploitation by foreign traders.\n\nThe British arrived during the late 19th century, and their administration (under the London-based British North Borneo Chartered Company) in North Borneo lasted sixty years, between 1881 and 1941. It aimed to transform North Borneo into a producer of various agricultural products, predominantly tobacco. Apart from the introduction of cash-crop farming, the Company also imposed new taxation laws and set up administrative centres. Some of the changes brought about by them were:\n\nIn its attempt to revitalise the sagging economy, then managing director of the British North Borneo Company, William C. Cowie also launched two major projects:\n\nNew levies were imposed to finance these large-scale projects. Lack of manpower, however, caused the Company to rely on local chieftains as agents for revenue collection. Among those who cooperated with the Company, some abused their authority and overtaxed the natives, exacerbating dissatisfaction among local people already burdened by other new laws imposed by the Company. Mat Salleh viewed the Company’s new rules as an infringement of native rights, refused to acknowledge the Company's authority, and continued to collect taxes from traders traveling via the Sugut River as he had before the rules were imposed, without turning them over to the Company. Numerous other local chiefs shared Mat Salleh's strong opinions against the Company's new rules. Many of them later joined his cause.\n\nThe Company had set up its initial administrative centres on the west coast of Sabah in Papar and Tempassuk. In between these areas also stood the Gaya station, set up in September 1882 as a collection station for jungle and local produce. This station also served as a \"stopping place\" for European officials plying between Kudat and Labuan.\nGaya Island was initially thought of as a highly prospective settlement site and a possible port of call. It later however, did not flourish as expected; trade, collection of local produce and other economic activities did not prosper. After the station in Gaya was raided and torched by Mat Salleh and his followers in July 1897, the British relocated to the mainland, in Gantian.\n\nMat Salleh first came to the Company's attention when he was suspected of involvement in the murder and robbery of two Iban traders on the Sugut River in 1894. Captain Barnett and a few other colonial officials were sent to Mat Salleh's residence to investigate the matter. Mat Salleh denied his and his followers’ involvement in it and resisted arrest. This incident marked the first of many misunderstandings, creating a tense and hostile situation between both parties.\n\nIn August 1895, in an attempt to have their grievances addressed through the colonial institution, Mat Salleh, his followers and traditional chiefs from Sugut went to Sandakan, then the seat of the government of North Borneo, to present a petition against the collection of poll-tax and the imposition of passes on boats by Government chiefs to then governor L. P. Beaufort and his representatives. They were however, away on another expedition. Treasurer-in-general Alexander Cook, who was aware of their visit instead denied them an audience. After two days of waiting, Mat Salleh and his party left and headed back\n\nFollowing this, a complaint against Mat Salleh and his party was forwarded to the governor and other colonial officials by Cook. In response, on 29 August 1895, representatives from the Company arrived at Mat Salleh’s home in Jambongan to arrest him and four of his followers on the grounds of disturbing the peace at Sandakan and involvement with the murders of the two Ibans in 1894. Mat Salleh refused to comply and escaped. This led to his house and village being attacked, burned and looted. The company then announced him as a wanted man. A Straits $500 reward was offered for his capture.\n\nThis incident triggered him to wage war against the British. He then consolidated his position at Lingkabau, approximately 50 miles up the Sugut river and with strong support from the native Kadazandusun community there, built a strong fort. The British subsequently attacked it but failed to capture him. Instead, they destroyed it and apprehended about 60 Kadazandusun natives.\n\nAfter this, he re-established himself in Labuk and built his headquarters at Limbawan. He had received support from the Labuk people as well. In September 1896, the British made another attack, surrounding Limbawan and cutting off possible escape routes. Again, they failed to apprehend him and also destroyed this fort. Following their escape, Mat Salleh and his followers built another fort at Padang at Ulu Sugut.\n\nAt midnight on 9 July 1897, Mat Salleh successfully led his followers to attack the Company’s settlement on Gaya Island. They raided and torched the Gaya compound before escaping with loot estimated to be worth Straits $100,000. They also took hostage F. S. Neubronner, the treasury clerk. The success of this attack increased his reputation as a local hero. This helped to further widen his reach, influence and support. After this attack, the Company proceeded to seek compensation from the Brunei Sultanate. The Managing Director, Cowie and the Governor, L. P. Beaufort, visited the Sultan of Brunei seeking compensation, claiming that some of the attackers were from regions under his jurisdiction. These areas were also claimed to have had been used as bases by Mat Salleh. The negotiations brought the Mengkabong, Manggatal and Api-Api districts (opposite of Gaya Island) under the Company's administration.\n\nAfter the successful attack on Gaya Island, Mat Salleh and his followers moved on to a fort on the Soan on the Labuk, then Parachangan on the Sugut, then proceeded to attack and burn down the government residency at Ambong in November 1897.\n\nFollowing this, he established his next fort at Ranau. On 13 December 1897, the Company attacked this Fort. They were defeated and lost about 10 men, including an Officer Jones, who had led the attack. On 9 January 1898, they attacked the fort for a second time with a bigger troop and captured it. However, by then, Mat Salleh and his men had already abandoned the fort and established a new one in the interior of Tambunan.\n\nThe Tambunan fort was stronger and more stable than his previous fort. It was reported to have been\nThis was also the last fort he used for defence in his struggle to rebel against the British.\n\nThe tit-for-tat dual reached deadlock by early 1898. Cowie, managing director to the court of directors of the British North Borneo Chartered Company, personally travelled from London to arrange peace talks and a peace pact with Mat Salleh (the Palatan Peace Pact). Simultaneously, the Sultan of Sulu wrote a letter to Dayang Bandung, Mat Salleh’s wife, urging a peace settlement with Cowie.\n\nThe meeting occurred at Kampung Palatan in Ulu Menggatal on 19 April 1898. Mat Salleh was offered a pardon if resistance ceased. Cowie verbally promised amnesty and to allow Mat Salleh to settle in the Tambunan Valley, pledging noninterference from the government. Mat Salleh acceded and offered to accept it on two conditions:\n\nCowie refused these conditions, permitting Mat Salleh only to stay in Tambunan or parts of the interior excluding Sugut and Lambuk, his former strongholds. In addition, Cowie made an additional promise that if Mat Sallah kept his peace for twelve consecutive months and cooperated with the Company, Cowie would recommend Mat Sallah to the court of directors for an appointment as chief or headman of a district.\n\nOn 20 April 1898, Cowie, governor L.P Beufort and two officers (P. Wise and A. Terms) met with Mat Salleh again and this time, he was allowed \"to live in the interior and take charge of the Tambunan district\". With this, a ceremony was held to mark Mat Salleh’s official possession of the Menggatal River on 22 April 1898. The next day, on 23 April 1898, the Company sent an official document to Mat Salleh to sign. The document stated that:\n\nMat Salleh and his allies were at war with the Tiawan communities. The latter approached the Company with urgent appeals for its intervention. This led to the governor, Beaufort, on 15 January 1899, visiting the Tiawan villages and obtaining an oath of allegiance from them. This was also, apparently, a strategic move by the Company. to pursue its plans to establish an administrative centre in Tambunan.\n\nSeeing this as a breach of faith to their earlier agreement, Mat Salleh prepared to resume resistance against the Company. In December 1899, R. M. Little, the resident of Labuan, was instructed to initiate negotiations. Mat Salleh refused negotiations and demanded their withdrawal from Tambunan. They refused. Almost immediately after this, Mat Salleh and his followers resumed waging sporadic attacks.\n\nThe Company sent a force to retaliate. They reached Tambunan 31 December 1899 and fighting commenced the next day. On 10 January 1900, the Village of Laland was lost to the Company. Mat Salleh lost 60 men. On 15 January 1900, the Company proceeded to acquire Taga villages and the fort of one of Mat Salleh’s chief lieutenants; Mat Sator was burned by shell-fire. They then cut the water supply to Mat Salleh’s fort by diverting the Pengkalian river to the Sensuran.\n\nOn 27 January 1900, Mat Salleh’s own fort was seized and shelled continuously for the next four days. The seemingly impenetrable fort finally fell due to a massive onslaught by the Company, and with this, Mat Salleh's final defences were finally broken.\n\nOn 31 January 1900, Mat Salleh was killed by shell-fire by mid-day. A chance shot from a Maxim Gun had hit Mat Salleh in the left temple, killing him instantly. Also killed in the battle were about 1000 of Mat Salleh’s followers who fought from the neighbouring villages of Lotud Tondulu, Piasau, Kitutud, Kepayan and Sunsuron.\n\nIt was, however, another five years before the remnants of Mat Salleh’s men surrendered, were killed or captured by the Company, marking the end of the rebellion in 1905.\n\nThe Mat Salleh memorial was opened in 1999 at the exact site where he was killed at Kampung Tibabar in Tambunan, as a tribute to remember Mat Salleh, who stood up and led a rebellion against the Company's rule. It was demolished in 2015.\n\nThe memorial, which resembled a fort, was surrounded by a garden. It housed Mat Salleh's photograph and some photos of his weapons and paraphernalia from the rebellion he led. A bronze plaque, set apart some metres from the building, still stands there and reads:\n\nAfter the memorial was opened, The New Straits Times (9 Mar 2000) reported Sabah museum director and Tambunan local, Joseph Pounis Guntavid, as suggesting that the British had long bragged about putting down Mat Salleh’s rebellion against their rule and was quoted, ‘\"but a search and study on Mat Salleh’s actions strongly indicated that he was not a rebel but a warrior who went against foreign rule, fighting for North Borneo ‘self-government’...Mat Salleh initiated patriotism that led the people to fight for self-rule until Sabah gained her independence through Malaysia on 16 September 1963\".\n\nMat Salleh, however, is not always seen as a hero. Many writers of this rebellion see Mat Salleh as a lone crusader and / or an opportunist solely interested in restoring his precolonial social position of power. To the British, he was a rebel and troublemaker, but to his supporters, he was and still is a warrior.\n\n"}

He also heads the sanctioning body of TWC, the Global Traditional Wing Chun Kung Fu Association (GTWCKFA). Cheung is responsible for introducing Bruce Lee to his master Ip Man when they were teenagers in Hong Kong.\n\nIn the 1950s Cheung grew up in Kowloon, where fighting skills were considered a measure of self-worth and pride, At age 11, Cheung's challenge matches were on the school playground and his fighting style was Tai Chi Chuan, which was not sufficient to elevate him among the youth of Hong Kong. This fighting was a concern and frowned upon by his father who was a police inspector; hence Cheung avoided becoming involved in gangs. By his teenage years however the challenge fights continued, and—as they are inextricably linked to extortion rackets of secret societies—Cheung's high-achieving family saw him as a source of embarrassment.\n\nA turning point in Cheung's life was when a gang leader who was undefeated in combat challenged an old man who was rumored to fight in a little–known Kung Fu style of a woman. Cheung witnessed the challenge and watched as the thin old man who was Ip Man quickly defeated the gang leader. Impressed by the old man's skill, Cheung visited Ip Man and became his student. Over the next few months Cheung became a favorite of Ip Man and became a live–in student for 3 years, before leaving Hong Kong.\n\nDuring his time living with Ip Man, Cheung introduced a then 15–year–old famous child actor, Bruce Lee, whom he first met at Lee's 9th birthday to Ip Man. Cheung and Lee became friends and training partners. After several months of training every day they both became more involved in street challenge fights until one day Cheung fought a triad leader and seriously wounded him. This prompted Cheung's father to send him away from Hong Kong to put him out of harm's way; however, the problems followed him, and he and his family decided that it was better for his safety to migrate to Australia to begin a new life.\n\nAfter moving to Melbourne, Australia to teach Traditional Wing Chun professionally in 1973, Cheung established his Wing Chun studio in Melbourne's CBD. According to \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", his studio attracts hundreds of new students each year. Cheung also trained students in the USA, including some who became successful in their martial arts careers, such as Eric Oram who went on to train Robert Downey Jr. and Christian Bale in preparation for their Hollywood movie roles. He also trained Anthony Arnett who has been winning martial arts tournaments since 1974 and has won grand champion multiple times some of which were for 3 years and 6 years running in different tournament circuits.\n\nAfter being involved in duels with several triad members he had defeated in China, Cheung had reason to fear for his life, so he decided to migrate to Australia in 1957. On the way there an incident occurred when he was forced to fight more than 10 sailors who were set up by the triads that sought revenge. Cheung sustained several stab wounds from the fight as some of the men were armed.\n\nIn 1984 Cheung set a world speed punching record of 8.3 punches per second at Harvard University in Boston.\n\n\nOver a 28-year period Cheung has been featured on the front cover of 35 magazines between 1982 and 2010, the first being \"Inside Kung Fu\" in October 1982 and the most recent \"Martial Arts Illustrated\" in April 2010.\n\nCheung attained a Bachelor of Economics from the Australian National University, after graduating from secondary school in Hong Kong. Cheung is a certified Doctor of Chinese Medicine under the Chinese Medicine Registration Board of Victoria, and a member of the Australian Chinese Traditional Orthopaedics Association Inc. He has also been invited as a Guest Professor to Foshan Sports University (China), and as a Senior Research Professor of the Bone Research Department to Beijing Chinese Medical University (China).\n\n\nCheung has produced a number of videos, including \"The Wing Chun Way\", \"Tao of Wing Chun\", \"My Life with Wing Chun\", \"Wing Chun – Advanced Training and Applications\", \"City of Dragons\", \"CMT – Cheung's Meridian Therapy\" and \"PRO-TEKT: A Personal Protection Program\".\n"}

It is a part of the Pontifical North American College, and served as its main campus from its founding in 1859 until the construction of a new campus on the Janiculum Hill in 1953. It also houses the Bishops' Office for United States Visitors to the Vatican.\n\nThe buildings that currently make up the Pontifical North American College's Casa Santa Maria encompass a large area, trapezoidal in shape, giving on to the Via dell'Umiltà, the Via dell'Archetto, the Vicolo del Monticello, and the Piazza della Pilotta. At first glance the buildings seem to be one single construction, but they are not; their external coherency is only the result of a fairly recent restructuring. To found the monastery that was originally housed on the site, multiple houses were purchased along the Via dell'Archetto. After the 1607 foundation date, additions to the property were made in 1641, 1681, and 1737. American College historian Robert McNamara describes the complex in 1859 as \"a large building, rangy and haphazard in form, making no claim to distinction in style, but combining under one roof quarters easily adaptable to housing a hundred or more young seminarians.\"\n\nHenry Brann, a historian of the American College, describes the building in the following terms (writing in 1910):\n\nIn ancient Roman times, the area in which the Casa Santa Maria is located was considered to be on a spur of the Quirinal Hill called the \"Mucialis.\" In the Middle Ages, before the construction of the church and convent that would eventually come to house the American College's seat in Rome, the area was covered with a complex of large Roman ruins popularly called the \"Prison of Virgil.\" In all likelihood, these would have been the remains of what modern archaeology has identified as the Quirinal Serapeum. Excavation works in 1947 revealed Roman ruins under the College chapel, but they cannot be authoritatively identified as belonging to the Serapeum; instead, they may be part of the \"Campus Agrippae\" or the \"Statio I Cohortium Vigilum.\"\n\nBy the Middle Ages the Roman structures mentioned above had fallen into decay. Nevertheless, before the founding of the monastery that would eventually become the Casa Santa Maria, a number of noble families moved into the area. One of these were the Orsini, from which the foundress of the monastery, Francesca Baglioni Orsini (c. 1540–1625) was descended. When her husband Francesco Orsini died in 1593, she refused to marry again. She returned to her native Rome from Florence, where she had worked as a governess of the princesses Eleanora and Maria de' Medici, and founded a monastery in which to live out the rest of her years. For that purpose, she purchased a block of buildings from Vincenzo Menichelli, \"\"Cavaliere Romano,\"\" for the sum of 6,500 \"scudi\", and named it the \"Monastero dell'Umiltà\" (Monastery of Humility). The convent's foundation was approved by Pope Paul V with the brief \"Inter universa\" of November 20, 1607. The cloister was solemnly dedicated and blessed on September 26, 1613. The convent took its first sisters from Dominican convents on the Quirinal, and the Rule of Saint Dominic was adopted for the house. All of the nuns of the Umiltà monastery were to be of noble background. The foundress lived in rooms of her own, was not obliged by the rule, and did not wear the habit; nevertheless her contemporaries remarked on her virtue and holiness before her death in 1625. An inscription marking the room in which she died is still present in the Casa Santa Maria today.\n\nThe Dominican sisters of the Umiltà maintained their convent for centuries, and were favorably noted for the strict observance of their rule. However, their tenure of the property was to come to an end as a result of Napoleon's campaigns in Italy. Although untouched during the invasion of Rome in 1798 and the temporary establishment of the Roman Republic, the eventual annexation of the Papal States to the French Empire led to the suppression of all convents and monasteries in the city on May 3, 1810. The house was taken over by the French government and the nuns evicted; while they sought refuge in other monasteries or left religious life, the convent was turned into a barracks for policemen. The return of Pope Pius VII to the city in 1814 meant the restoration of many convents in the city, but the Umiltà sisters were never able to return to their home and the monastery became extinct.\n\nIn turn, the convent was granted to the Visitation Sisters on August 14, 1814. They made some immediate changes to the monastery chapel, including installing an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe by Miguel Cabrera which had been gifted to them by Pope Benedict XIV in the mid 1700s. It remains in the chapel to this day. During the time of the Visitation sisters, the monastery was often visited by Don Vincenzo Pallotti, a future canonized saint. Just thirty five years after acquiring the property, however, the Visitandines were forced to leave their new home by compulsion of the revolutionary Roman Republic in 1849. On June 5, a commissar of the Republic appeared at the convent at six in the evening, informed the superior that the house was to be taken over, and the sisters were forced to leave within six hours. The complex was once again turned into a barracks, this time for the occupying French army that drove out the Republic. It remained in that use until 1854.\n\nThe old Visitation monastery passed into the hands of the American College thanks to the express will of Pope Pius IX, who used to serve Mass there for the Visitation sisters as a young boy. While other Colleges had been vying for its convenient location and spacious property, Pope Pius ensured that it would be given to the American College, whose founding had been a project of his own initiative. He even personally contributed the money to purchase the property. The new College was opened ceremonially on December 8, 1859, and the new foundation received a formal visit from the pope on January 29, 1860.\n\nThe structure served as the main seat of the American College in Rome for almost a century. This changed as a result of the situation developing in Europe in 1940, when the American seminarians were forced to depart \"en masse\" on May 31 of that year. In the end, they had to complete their studies at various seminaries back in the United States. The property, while remaining in the possession of the bishops of the United States, was requisitioned for \"charitable wartime employment\" in 1943. Until mid-1947, it served as a home for displaced Italian children. Later that year, the property was returned to the use of the American College. Under the direction of Martin J. O'Connor, Rector of the College, a general restoration of the whole complex was begun. With the construction of a new and larger campus at Villa Gabrielli on the Janiculum, the buildings on Via dell'Umiltà were rechristened the \"Casa Santa Maria,\" and set aside for the use of priests pursuing graduate studies at universities in Rome. That continues to be its primary function today.\n\nThe history and devotional practices of the Dominican and Visitation nuns that once inhabited the building have affected the life of the American College. For example, a devotion to Our Lady of Humility has been adopted as the College's own, and certain privileged feasts of the nuns, such as the Visitandines' celebration of St. Francis de Sales, were always celebrated with special solemnity by the College as well. Another example relates to the fact that the declaration as Venerable (an early step in the process of canonization) of the Visitandine nun, later saint, Margaret Mary Alacoque, occurred in the Church of the Umiltà in 1846. In recognition of that connection, Henry Brann was able to claim in 1910 that the American College was \"inseparably associated with the devotion of the Sacred Heart of Jesus\".\n\nThe American College's chapel, the full name of which is \"Santa Maria Assunta al monastero dell’Umiltà\" (\"Saint Mary of the Assumption at Humility Monastery\"), was originally the church attached to the monastery founded by Francesca Baglioni Orsini. The cornerstone was laid on March 7, 1601. The original church, which was finished about a decade later, was entirely rebuilt between 1641 and 1646 and it is that second structure that rises on the site today. The architect was Paolo Maruscelli, a Florentine. Although some details of its decoration have changed throughout the centuries, \"the victim of later, more elaborate and flamboyant tastes,\" the architectural plan and basic structure remain the same today. A notable later addition is the highly ornate carved wooden organ loft, the work of Sebastiano Moroni in 1735.\n\nThe church is vaulted, and lighted by four windows above a large cornice. That cornice, in turn, is supported by twelve pilasters, six on a side. There are four chapels in the church in addition to the main tribune. The main altar houses a tabernacle made from sardonyx agate, over which used to be placed an image of Our Lady of Humility by Pietro Perugino. That image, however, was lost sometime before 1814. When the chapel was transferred to the newly-formed American College, Archbishop Gaetano Bedini substituted it with a copy of the image of Our Lady of Mercy that is venerated in Rimini. This image is enclosed in an amethyst frame surrounded by a bas relief of four angels in gilded bronze. Two angels in white marble support the frame. The whole main altar was the work of Martino Longhi the Younger, who completed the work between 1643 and 1646. Sometime around 1859, it was moved away from the wall and raised to a higher level. Between the pilasters are six stucco statues of female saints: Cecilia, Catherine, Barbara, Agatha, Ursula, and Agnes. These statues are the work of Antonio Raggi and were sculpted and put in place between 1663 and 1674.\n\nThe church's exterior facade is said to be the work of Carlo Fontana, even if that cannot be established for certain. In any case, it no longer appears today as it did at the time of its completion. When the monastery was handed over to the Americans by Pope Pius IX, the architect Andrea Busiri built a storey above the church, which altered the facade by substituting a Neoclassical pediment in place of Fontana's Baroque one.\n\nExtensive restoration work was completed on the church in 1947, when the property was returned to the use of the American College following World War II. Notable improvements to the chapel included a new marble floor executed in the color \"rosso di Francia\", cleaning of the frescoes in the vault, and retouching of the stucco figures around the sanctuary.\n\nAs home to the graduate department of the Pontifical North American College, the Casa Santa Maria provides a residence and community for priests pursuing graduate studies at a variety of universities, institutes, and academic programs in the city of Rome. In 2015, the Casa housed seventy-two student priests, representative of forty-two dioceses in the United States and other English-speaking countries. The previous superior of the house was Monsignor Ferdinando Berardi of the Archdiocese of New York. \n\nThe current superior of Casa Santa Maria is the Reverend James J. Conn, SJ JD, JCD of the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus.\n\nThe Visitors' Office at the Casa Santa Maria is an initiative sponsored jointly by both the North American College and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, and staffed by the Religious Sisters of Mercy of Alma, Michigan. The Office exists to assist pilgrims from the United States in planning a journey to Rome, assisting with requests for papal audience tickets, tours of the catacombs and the Vatican Necropolis, and requests for papal blessings.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nWorks cited\n\n"}

Unlike many rock bands that would come later, their style was becoming more mainstream, becoming closer to pop, especially compared with the bands like Prljavo kazalište or Film.\n\nAs years went by, their refusal to change style proved to be the important factor in the band's longevity. They kept a loyal following in 1980s and in 1990s, refusing to allow elements of folk and turbo folk music to become part of their repertoire. Because of that the band enjoys great respect among many Croatian rock critics, being seen as the embodiment of \"true\" rock and urban culture and many of their songs are considered evergreens in the former Yugoslavia like \"Sve još miriše na nju\", \"Jesen u meni\", \"Ugasi me\" and \"Zastave\". Parni valjak kept a relatively small but dedicated following for 30 years, and many people tend to gather at their concerts that feature energetic performances, despite advanced age of the band's members: \"Aki Rahimovski\" - vocals, \"Husein Hasanefendić-Hus\" - guitars, Marijan Brkić Brk - guitars, \"Berislav Blažević-Bero\" - keyboards, \"Zvonimir Bučević-Buč\" - bass guitar, \"Dražen Scholz-Šolc\" - drums, \"Tina Rupčić\" - vocal, \"Anita Mlinarić\" - sax.\n\nIn December 2005, Parni valjak made a farewell tour of Croatia and Slovenia on their 30th birthday.

On 4 July 2017, drummer Darko Jelčić left the band. He is the second longest-standing member of Crvena Jabuka, playing in every album until 2017. He was replaced with Adrian Borić. Žerić played keyboards and sang backing vocals on their debut album, but then became the lead singer with the death of Drazen Ricl and Aljosa Buha. Kresemir Kastelan, and Niksa Bratos come in third and fourth as the longest-standing members respectively.\n\nThe band's heyday was between 1985 and 1992. In 1992, long-time contributor, rhythm guitarist/songwriter Zlatko Arslanagić quit the band which resulted in a major rift in the band. However, the group re-located to Zagreb around late summer 1994 and by 1996 had reinvented their image and continue their career to this very day.\n\nDuring the mid 2000s, the group's popularity started declining. However, with the beginning of the 2010s, the band seems to have gotten back on track.\n\nCrvena jabuka was founded in 1985. The first line-up of the band consisted of drummer Darko Jelčić, lead guitarist/singer Dražen Ričl \"Zijo\", bassist Aljoša Buha, rhythm guitarist/lead songwriter Zlatko Arslanagić \"Zlaja\", and keyboardist/vocalist Dražen Žerić \"Žera.\" The band's name was derived from an occasion when Darko Jelčić brought a red apple to one of the band's meetings. They released their self titled debut album in 1986, and it was an instant success. The album contained their singles \"Bježi kišo s prozora\", \"S tvojih usana\", and \"Dirlija\". The band quickly gained popularity all over former Yugoslavia, and on September 18, 1986 the band headed to Mostar for a promotional concert, and suffered a car accident that claimed the lives of two members. - Dražen Ričl and Aljoša Buha.\n\nIn tribute of this tragic moment, a concert was done in Skenderija palace in Sarajevo in which musicians and bands from all generations performed. Crvena jabuka would end with their work.\n\nBecause the material for 1987's \"Za sve ove godine\" was already ready, the band decided to first record that before undergoing a one-year hiatus. The band decided to stay a trio with Drazen Zeric (who originally sang backup vocals) taking on lead vocal duties. Guitarist Zlatko Arslanagic also switched to mostly lead/bass guitar, and Darko Jelcic decided to remain on drums. Next to him, Zeric was the only original member present in the band. Also, as the 1987 album was meant to be a tribute to the late Ricl and Buha, there were no promo ads. Nor was there a tour because of the requests of the band members.\n\nIt was, however, 1988's Sanjati that proved the band's commercial success. While the album was recorded in the same fashion as Za sve ove godine, the band brought in two more musicians, bassist Srdan Serberdia, and keyboardist Zlatko Volarevic. This allowed Zera to focus primarily on vocals, and Zlaja to go to just lead guitar. The album sold 250,000 copies, and following its release, Crvena Jabuka embarked on a 180 concert tour.\n\nThe band made some major changes during the recording of Sanjati. First, the band worked in Rockoko studios in Zagreb. They would record every future album there. Secondly, the band dropped producer Zeljko Brodinac (who had produced their first two albums), and got Niksa Bratos. (Niksa would eventually be inducted as another full-time member, and the third long-standing member next to Jelcic and Zeric.) Not only was Bratos a producer, but a multi-instrumentalist. He could put all the band's ideas to work, and even did string arrangements. He would be put on rhythm guitar, and would also play many woodwind instruments on future albums.\n\nJanuary 1989 was when the recording contract for the band's fourth album called \"Tamo gdje ljubav počinje\" was signed. Serberdia, having grown tired of touring with the band, quit right after the first session so was replaced by professional guitarist/bassist Branko Salka. Immediately after this release, a tour took place. During the tour Niksa Bratos was not available, but suggested a good friend of his, Igor Ivanovic. The significant moment was at the Sports Arena in Zagreb where a double album was recorded live called \"\"Uzmi me (kad hoćeš ti)\"\".\n\nIn 1991, the band released their fifth studio album. This album was titled \"Nekako s' proljeća\", and had the singles \"Moje najmilije\", \"Da nije ljubavi\", and the title cut which has Kemal Monteno as a guest. This would be the first time that Jabuka has collaborated with another singer. For this album, Niksa Bratos was once again replaced. This time, by former bassist Srdan Serberdia's father, Zoran Serberdia.\n\nA tour was meant to happen, but it was never done due to the wars in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. After this album, Zlatko Arslanagić left the band and eventually moved to Toronto. Žera opened his new cafe in Sarajevo called \"Broj jedan\" (Number one). Even the remaining members parted ways. Niksa moved to Zagreb (and so would the rest of the band eventually), Igor Ivanovic to Germany, and Zoran Serberdia to Macedonia. Furthermore, Croatia Records released, in 1993, an 18-hit compilation entitled Ima nesto od srca do srca. The album was put into chronological order, but for unknown reasons, omitted both \"Bjezi liso s' prozora\", and a cover of Bacila je sve niz rijeku (a hit for Indexi in 1974). This album would, in 2005, be re-released but dubbed \"Zlatna Kolekcija\". It would include the two said songs that were previously omitted, and also be in chronological order with 20 songs more than this one.\n\nIn the fall of 1994, Cunja, and Zera both relocated to Zagreb to re-unite with Niksa Bratos who now was to play on every album, and attend most shows. A backing vocals trio of Darija Hodnik, Jana Nemacek, and Mirza Treterac was established to the band, and so were three more members: guitarist Mario Vukcevic-Jimmy, bassist Kresmir Kastelan \"Kreso\" (4th long-standing member), and keyboard player Danijel Lastric. There was a big tour once again covering: Macedonia, the Czech Republic, Austria, Germany, and Armenia, and of course, the former Yugoslavia countries.\n\nWith this new lineup, the band released their next album in 1996 called \"U tvojim očima\". This album featured two guests as well as various authors of songs including Saša Lošić of Plavi orkestar. Immediately a tour went of all over including: Zagreb, Tuzla, Mostar, and Sarajevo.\n\nIn 1998, yet another studio album was released titled \"Svijet je lopta šarena\". This was another best selling album of the band. In that same year they recorded their next live album simply called \"\"LIVE\"\", and in 1999, Crvena jabuka released an unplugged album called \"Riznice sjećanja\".\n\nIn 2000, the band went on a new chapter with their next studio album entitled \"Sve što sanjam\". On this album the band had the hit singles \"Ti si lijepa\", \"Tvoga srca vrata\", the title track, \"Ni zadnji ni prvi\", and another good hit \"Niko nije lud da spava\".\n\nIn 2002, Crvena jabuka returned with \"Tvojim željama vođen\". After releasing this album, guitarist Zlatko Bebek, and keyboard player Danijel Lastrić left the band. The replacements were Marko Bjelić on keyboards, and Damir Gonz on guitar.\n\nIn 2005, Žera reformed the band. The result was \"Oprosti što je ljubavna\". With this album, the band started to lose its popularity. However, a 20th anniversary concert was held on April 24, 2005.\n\n2005 also saw the release of an updated hit singles collection that the band called \"Zlatna kolekcija\". It contained hits from 1986 to 2002.\n\nIn 2007, Crvena jabuka announced yet another album called \"Duša Sarajeva\". The album has 11 new songs.\n\nDuring the time of 2007-2008 the band was mostly doing concerts touring Canada and USA. Cities covered were Toronto, Ontario in Canada, and in the US: Chicago, Detroit, and most lately there is talk of coming to Seattle on 6 June. Concerts are also expected to happen in Calgary, Alberta, and in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nSinger Dražen Žerić-Žera got married a couple of years ago, which is the reason for the band's album entitled \"Volim te\", which has songs more in the style of the old Crvena Jabuka rather than what they've showed in \"Oprosti što je ljubavna\" and \"Duša Sarajeva\" .\n\nThe band released an album in 2011 entitled \"Za tvoju ljubav\", which was an even more intense approach to the new, more modern sounding Crvena Jabuka. The album featured hits such as \"Do neba\", \"Kletva (feat. Željko Bebek), and more.\n\nIn mid 2013, the band released their latest album entitled \"Nek' bude ljubav\". The evolution of the band's sound is quite evident on this album. The first single released for this album is for the track entitled \"Imam neke fore\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2185217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2185217", "title": "Ayyavazhi and Hinduism", "text": "Ayyavazhi and Hinduism\n\nAyyavazhi and Hinduism are two belief systems in India. Although Ayyavazhi continues to officially exist within Hinduism and is considered by some observers to be a Hindu denomination, members of the religion claim that it is independent. The most notable distinction between Hinduism and Ayyavazhi is their different approaches to the concepts of good, evil and dharma.\n\nHindus view Vedas, Gita, and other texts from the Shastra as canonical scriptures, instead of the Akilam. The Ayyavazhi believe that the Hindu scriptures were once canonical, but now have lost their Substance because of the advent of Akilam. Kaliyan bought the Vedas as a Boon and so all the previous religious books including Agamas and Puranas lost their Substances, leaving Akilattirattu Ammanai as the only book of perfection. Several dubious claims state that the present day Vedas are not accepted by Ayyavazhi as books of Perfection, because there is a quote in Akilam about Venneesan \"\"Avan pilathaal vedamondruntakki\"\" (He created a Veda of his own intention). All previous religious texts have lost their Substance in the vision of Ayyavazhi at the very moment Kaliyan came to the world.\n\nThough Ayyavazhi has many differences from popular Hinduism, it has many beliefs and practices in common. As Hinduism is really a tree of many branches, Ayyavazhi is closest to Smartism and its Advaita beliefs in thought.\n\nThe religious practises of Ayyavazhi largely differ from traditional Hinduism. Akilam says that previous practices were not wrong, but that they were distorted because of the abnormal, cruel nature of Kaliyan and his boons, which the Universe had experienced before. Akilattirattu Ammanai says that the whole acts and rules of the Universe had changed by the advent of Kaliyan. Thiru Nadana Ula, a part of Akilam eight discusses this change in detail.\n\nThe Ayyavazhi people use a unique religious mark. The vertical white mark is worn on the forehead in the shape of a flame, starting from the central point between the eyebrows, and rising to the top edge of the forehead. The flame shape represents Aanma Jyothi or Atman. Zealous devotees smear it on the exterior of the upper arms and over the chest. This white mark is unlike the one worn by a Hindu of Vaishnavist tradition, worn on the forehead in the shape of a 'U', or of Saivist tradition who wear it horizontally as three parallel lines. The white powder used for this mark was made from coarse white soil, found at lower layer of the earth, while ash is used in Hinduism.\n\nAt present, those who 'serve' in Pathis or Nizhal Thangals wear this white mark for the people and give a portion of it to their hands. People carry it home as a holy object, and some of them even swallow a little of it believing it to be medicinal.\n\nOne of the significant ritual actions that distinguishes Ayyavazhi male worshipper from others is 'wearing headgear' during worship. Ayya Vaikundar seems to have enjoined his male followers to tie on headgear when they came to worship God, considering it as a crown. Accordingly, the male followers tied on headgear during worship. This is to reveal that every person is a king and every one is to rule the Earth. This philosophy is told symbolically by the practice of wearing the headgear. It was a counteraction to the practice of tying a cloth around the waist, which symbolizes bondage.\n\nIt became a ritual action to be performed before entering the Pathi to worship. Male devotees usually removed their upper garment and tied the headgear before entering the Pathi. To this day this practice is followed.\n\nThe Nizhal Thangals and Pathis have, in their sanctuary, a mirror to reflect the images worshippers. People pay obeisance to their God standing in front of this mirror, facing the Elunetru amidst two oil lamps. Even in the houses of the people of Ayyavazhi, the place earmarked for their daily worship has at least a mirror and a lamp. The mirror's placement symbolizes that God is inside oneself and it is of no use to seek God elsewhere. This practice is different from the placement of murti, or icon in Hindu Temples, in that this is a non-anthropomorphic form of worship. In different denominations of Hinduism, Saivites venerate the linga and Vaishnavites venerate the saligrama in a non-anthropomorphic form of worship.\n\nThe Ayyavazhi mode of worship was new in that milieu. It distinguished itself from the Sanskrit religion and folk religions. Instructions for abandoning temple worship, temple offerings, priestly functions, blood sacrifices and image worship abound in Akilam. Unlike some practices in Hinduism, it says, \"Do not institute Temples, Do not offer puja, blood sacrifices, do not kill animals, do not worship images made of Clay\" etc.\n\nThe Tamil language is considered sacred, rather than Sanskrit, as is holy within mainstream Hinduism. In Akilam there is a quote that Tamil will be the language in Dharma Yukam. Also unlike other Hindu scriptures in Tamil, Akilattirattu and Arul Nool were written using a simple form of language. Extracts from ancient Hindu scriptures are found in it, translated simply, so that common people could understand.\n\nA few beliefs of Ayyavazhi are different from Hinduism.\n\nAyyavazhi believes Vaikundar is the incarnation of Narayana in this Kali Yukam, sent to destroy the evils of Kali yuga. Hindus accept Kalki rather than Vaikundar as the Incarnation who will be sent to destroy such evil. Also, Hindus believe that the spirit of Kali yuga has yet to be destroyed, but Ayyavazhi says that the spirit of Kali Yuga started its decline immediately after the Avatar of Vaikundar arrived. This was due to the torture of a Pantaram (Vaikundar), who was tortured because he had promised to Thirumal that he would not harm any Pantaram.\n\nRegarding Yukams, Ayyavazhi believes in a system of Eight Yukams while Hinduism suggests a system of four Yugas (Yukams).\n\nAyyavazhi believes in a primordial manifestation of evil Kroni similar to Satan in Abrahamic Religions, while Hinduism has no personification of Evil.\n\nThe view on Trimurti (three aspects of Brahman) is similar to Smartism, which like Ayya Vazhi, recognizes that Brahma, Vishnu and Siva are different aspects of the same God. By contrast, for example, in Saivism, Sivan (the Tamil name for Siva) is considered superior while in Vaishnavism Vishnu is considered superior. In Ayyavazhi the three were considered equal in all the previous six Yukams. But only in Kali Yukam are all the powers surrendered to Narayana by Sivan and Nathan because Kaliyan was created by them without discussion with Narayana. Regarding Vaikunda Avatharam, Ayya Vaikundar is superior to the three because the Moolamoorthy or Paramathma, superior to Trimuthi is that who incarnates as Vaikundar, but in Hinduism Vishnu incarnates. However Vishnu was the first to form in this Universe within the three according to Akilam.\n\nAyyavazhi believes in a Dharma Yukam where Vaikundar rules the world with the Santror Makkal. In Hinduism they believe in Satya Yuga which does not mention Vaikundar.\n\nIn Ayyavazhi, Vaikundar performed symbolic marriages by which he unified all the powers of the universe into himself and so all were seen as one, which is similar to the beliefs of Smartism. But in other branches of Hinduism, they acknowledge different powers as superior and may worship different powers in different forms.\n\nAmongst the Ayyavazhi, congregational worship is practiced, while in Hinduism the Priest chants the mantras and performs rituals, and the devotees watch. But in Ayyavazhi the Panivediyalar chants the mantras and the others repeat it.\n\nIn Ayyavazhi Thottu Namam means \"wearing Thirunamam with a personal touch\", which means the Panivedaiyalar will bestow the Thirunamam by touching the forehead of the devotees. But in Hinduism the Priests gives the Prachatham by throwing, in the belief that if he happened to touch the worshipers body it would make him ritually unclean. In olden days this was practiced because the Brahmins kept a distance from the other castes. This \"Thottu Namam\" was an intentional counteraction of this ancient Hindu tradition, put forward by Ayyavazhi.\n\nUnlike the traditional Hindu way of marriage, Ayyavazhi does not have many ritual practices. But it also differs in marriage as a whole. In Ayyavazhi the couple was seated facing the geographic south witnessing the Thuvaraiyam Pathi in the Indian Ocean. In addition to the priest, all the people who witness the marriage chant the mantras, and praise the couple following the priest, while in Hinduism this was done only by the Priest.\n\nIn Ayyavazhi, unlike in Hinduism, the body of the dead is buried. Generally, Hinduism mandates cremation and limits burial to monks and children under five.\n\nThe body is buried in a position that faces the geographic north in a Padmasana position. No boxes such as coffins are used. The body is placed inside and covered by sand or Namam (sacred soil). This practice is done with the belief that the deceased is performing austerity for the unfolding of Dharma Yukam. There was also a belief that the body of a person who was free from birth will not decay, and will be preserved as it is. Then as the Dharma Yukam unfolds, Vaikundar will blow a Conch shell and these people will rise from the grave. This scenario resembles the Last Judgment in the Abrahamic religions.\n\nThe practice of burial is strikingly similar to funeral practices, in Lingayatism, a reform movement in Karnataka, like Ayyavazhi, which was critical of the caste system. Unlike Ayyavazhi, Lingyatism focuses on Shiva as the supreme God.\n\nLike Hinduism the male worshippers of Ayyavazhi do not wear any upper garments during worship. Footwear is prohibited in worship centers. Also in Ayyavazhi, the female worshippers do not go to worship centers during the period of Menses, like other Hindus.\n\nThe practice of circumambulation is quite commonly seen in Ayyavazhi as in Hinduism. In Ayyavazhi the devotees use to take a bath and circumambulate the outer Pathi and then the inner Pathi and then the sanctum sanatorium.\n\nSaffron is considered as sacred in Ayyavazhi as in its father religion, Hinduism. All the Panividaiyalars (those who perform Panividai) in Pathis and Nizhal Thangals dress in a saffron dothi and saffron headgear which are collectively known as Kavi Vasthiram. This is also the colour of the flag that is to be hoisted in Pathis, as told as Chandiravarnam, and is the colour of the Ayyavazhi flags hoisted over their temples.\n\nLike Hinduism, and particularly Saivism Ayyavazhi consider Rudraksha to be sacred.\n\nLike Hinduism, Ayyavazhi stress Theertham. But according to Ayyavazhi, Muttirikkinaru and Muttappathi were considered most sacred.\n\nAyyavazhi like the Advaita tradition within Hinduism accepts the Ultimate Oneness, which is akin to the concept of Brahman. It says that the universe formed from the Ekam. Thiruvasakam - 2 describes the formation of this present Universe. Like Advaita, it believes that Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva are different aspects of the same God.\n\nJust as Mahaprabhu Caitanya was thought of as an incarnation of Vishnu (and more specifically of Krishna) in Gaudiya Vaishnavism so too is Ayya Vaikundar thought to be an incarnation of Vishnu. It is believed that God incarnates Himself to educate his children on obtaining union with Him.\n\nAyyavazhi, like Hinduism, believes in reincarnation. It states that all lives are continually reborn until they reach Dharma Yukam, the state of Moksha.\n\nAyyavazhi disciples believe in the law of karma and that practicing good karma will grant them Moksha. The practice of good karma leads the devotee to God.\n\nMoksha is the goal of Ayyavazhi. The Ayyavazhi disciple believes like other Hindus that this too is a union with God in which the soul achieves perfect Shanti (\"peace\") and Swarga (\"heaven.\")\n\nAhimsa is Sanskrit for \"non-violence\" and the Ayyavazhi accept this principle.\n\nThe Ayyavazhi believe in the vegetarian principle, which is an important aspect of Ahimsa. Ayya Vaikundar is considered an incarnation of Vishnu and in Vaishnavism, meat-eating is forbidden.\n\nThis principle (known in Sanskrit as Sankirtana Yajna) is an essential sacrifice especially for this age. It is believed that chanting the name of the Lord is an auspicious way to worship.\n\nIn Hinduism it is believed that the spirit of God is present within the heart of every human. The Ayyavazhi too believe that God is present within humans.\n\nIn the Ayyavazhi tradition, it is believed that in the final judgement, the demon will be sentenced to hell while Vaikundar and Santror will rule the world. In Hinduism also it is believed that God Vishnu will incarnate Himself to destroy this age of hypocrisy.\n\nAlthough the Ayyvazhi prefer local language rather than Sanskrit, devotees name their children in Sanskrit (e.g. Vaikunar, Krishna, Narayan.)\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2185228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2185228", "title": "Bids for the 2008 Summer Olympics", "text": "Bids for the 2008 Summer Olympics\n\nTen cities submitted bids to host the 2008 Summer Olympics and Paralympics that were recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), five of which made the IOC Executive Committee's shortlist. The games were awarded to Beijing, China on July 13, 2001. The other shortlisted cities were Toronto, Paris, Istanbul and Osaka. Beijing won an absolute majority of votes after two rounds of voting, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds of voting. IOC delegates and the media identified a number of factors in its favor, including the size of the country, improvements in Chinese anti-doping enforcement, and its close loss to Sydney, Australia eight years earlier. In that bidding process, which chose the host city for the 2000 Summer Olympics, Beijing led every round of voting but lost in the final round to Sydney by two votes.\n\nA number of politicians and non-governmental organizations criticized the Beijing bid and its selection due to concerns about China's human rights record. In response, supporters of the Beijing bid suggested that hosting the games might lead to \"progress\" on human rights and other issues. Some IOC delegates also expressed concerns about air pollution and heat in Beijing during the summer, and its effects on athletes participating in the games. In order to address such concerns, the Beijing bid included plans to reduce both air and water pollution in the city in advance of the games.\n\nThe Olympic bidding process begins with the submission of a city's application to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by its National Olympic Committee (NOC) and ends with the election of the host city by the members of the IOC during an ordinary session. The process is governed by the Olympic Charter, as stated in Chapter 5, Rule 34.\n\nThe bidding process for the 2008 Summer Olympics was the first in which the process consisted of two phases. Subsequent bidding processes have followed the same model. During the first phase, which begins immediately after the bid submission deadline, the \"applicant cities\" are required to answer a questionnaire covering themes of importance to a successful Games organisation. This information allows the IOC to analyse the cities' hosting capacities and the strengths and weaknesses of their plans. Following a detailed study of the submitted questionnaires and ensuing reports, the IOC Executive Board selects the cities that are qualified to proceed to the next phase. The second phase is the true candidature stage: the accepted applicant cities (from now on referred to as \"candidate cities\") are required to submit a second questionnaire in the form of an extended, more detailed, candidature file. These files are carefully studied by the IOC Evaluation Commission, a group composed of IOC members, representatives of international sport federations, NOCs, athletes, the International Paralympic Committee, and international experts in various fields. The members of the Evaluation Commission then make four-day inspection visits to each of the candidate cities, where they check the proposed venues and are briefed about details of the themes covered in the candidature file. The Evaluation Commission communicates the results of its inspections in a report sent to the IOC members up to one month before the electing IOC Session.\n\nThe IOC Session in which a host city is elected takes place in a country that did not submit an application to stage the Olympics. The election is made by the assembled active IOC members (excluding honorary and honour members), each possessing one vote. Members from countries that have a city taking part in the election cannot vote while the city is in the running. The voting is conducted in a succession of rounds until one bid achieves an absolute majority of votes; if this does not happen in the first round, the bid with the fewest votes is eliminated and another voting round begins. In the case of a tie for the lowest number of votes, a special runoff vote is carried out, with the winner proceeding to the next round. After each round, the eliminated bid is announced. Following the announcement of the host city, the successful bid delegation signs the \"Host City Contract\" with the IOC, which delegates the responsibilities of the Games organisation to the city and respective NOC.\n\nA number of cities expressed some interest in bidding or were mentioned as potential bidders for the 2008 Summer Olympics, but did not do so. These bids were not internally selected by the NOC (in case of more than one bidding city from the same country), were not put forward to the IOC, were withdrawn before filing the necessary paperwork, or never rose above speculation. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil received early funding to develop a bid for the 2008 Games but instead decided to bid for the 2012 games. Cape Town, South Africa and Buenos Aires, Argentina lost bids for the 2004 Summer Olympics and media reports suggested they might shift their bids to the 2008 Games, although they did not. Monterrey, Mexico was in the earliest stages of organizing a bid but did not complete the process. Other cities hinted at submitting bids or were mentioned as possible bidders in media reports but did not do so, including: Lisbon, Portugal; Krasnaya Polyana, Russia; a joint Israel/Palestinian bid; New York City, United States; Prague, Czech Republic; Pusan, South Korea; Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (Vancouver was bidding for the 2010 Winter Olympics); and Moscow, Russia.\n\nTen cities applied to host the 2008 Summer Olympics. Applicant cities were required to submit responses to a written questionnaire by June 20, 2000. They were also given documents outlining the selection process and the IOC's Code of Ethics. The IOC Candidature Acceptance Working Group analyzed the responses and quantified the applicant's potential to be a host city based on eleven criteria: government support and public opinion, general infrastructure, sports infrastructure, olympic village, environmental conditions and impact, accommodation, transport, security, experience from past sports events, finance, and the general concept. Each of these criteria was given a weight which was then used to calculate an overall score for that applicant city. If a city did not get a final score of at least 6 out of 10, they would not be recommended for candidature.\n\nIn its final report, the Candidature Acceptance Working Group recommended only four cities as meeting the minimum standard for being a host city, as denoted by a score of 6 on their scale. These cities were Beijing, China; Osaka, Japan; Paris, France; and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The IOC Executive Committee received this report and met on August 28, 2000 to decide which applicant cities would become candidate cities. When they met, the Executive Committee chose to promote five cities to candidature, the four recommended by the Working Group as well as Istanbul, Turkey. As stipulated, the IOC granted them the right to use the Olympic rings on their candidature emblem, together with a label identifying each as a Candidate City. The following five cities which submitted bids did not make the IOC's short list:\n\nEach of the five candidate cities was then evaluated by the IOC's fourteen member Evaluation Commission, chaired by Hein Verbruggen. These evaluations included site visits to each of the host cities and analysis of each city's potential across 18 themes. The four-day-long visits occurred between February 21 and March 28, 2001, with visits to each specific city on the following dates:\n\nThe Commission attempted to identify any major risks the IOC would be taking if each city were chosen to host the Games. In its final report, the Commission refrained from ranking each of the cities or identifying a favorite. Instead, they identified three cities as excellent candidates; Beijing, Paris, and Toronto. In effect, the commission recommended each of these cities equally. In rejecting Istanbul, they expressed concerns about the ability of the city to coordinate financing and construction of infrastructure. In particular, they were concerned that the plans for transportation infrastructure improvements would be difficult to achieve. Osaka was also not rated excellent due to concerns about financing and traffic congestion.\n\nTheir report was submitted to the IOC President and Executive Committee on May 15, 2001. Following that meeting, an anonymous document circulated that claimed IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch had inappropriately placed pressure on the Evaluation Commission during the drafting of its report. An IOC press release on June 13, 2001 categorically denied those rumors.\n\nThe 112th session of the IOC, where the decision about the host city took place, was held in Moscow, Russia from July 13–16, 2001. Voting on the question of the host city took place on July 13, 2001. Presentations of the candidate cities began at 9:30 AM in the Congress Hall of Moscow's World Trade Center. This was followed by the official presentation of the Evaluation Committee report to the IOC delegates and, soon after, the delegates began casting their votes. Of the 122 members of the IOC at the time, 105 were eligible to vote in the first round. Members who were not present or who represented countries with candidate cities were not allowed by IOC rules to vote. However, after the elimination of a city in each round, members who had previously been barred from voting due to that city's candidacy were allowed to vote in subsequent rounds. The IOC members who were unable to vote included:\n\nAt the end of the first round of voting, only Beijing, Toronto, Paris, and Istanbul remained; Osaka was eliminated after having received only six votes. Beijing had opened a wide lead, however, receiving more than double the number of votes received by second place Toronto. In the second round, Beijing received enough votes to have an absolute majority (possibly due to the Osaka supporters switching to its side) and no subsequent rounds of voting were required. The results of the second round were as follows: Beijing garnered 56 votes, Toronto 22, Paris 18, and Istanbul 9. According to IOC rules Beijing at that point became the official host city for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Results from the two rounds of voting were as follows:\n\nWhile many nations praised the choice of Beijing, opposing groups objected arguing that China's human rights issues made it unfit for the honor. The European Parliament issued a resolution on Beijing's bid to host the 2008 Summer Olympics. To quell concerns over this, Beijing chose the motto of \"New Beijing, Great Olympics\" in order to emphasize the country's movement towards new ideals for the new millennium.\n\nIn its bid for the Summer Olympics made in 2001, the PRC made several promises to the IOC regarding improvements with human rights, press freedoms, and environmental concerns. However, it was widely reported by western media sources that China failed to live up to the guarantees it made in order to bolster its chances of winning the bid for the games.\n\nBeijing Olympic bid chief Wang Wei stated in 2001:\n\nHowever, the human rights group Amnesty International released a statement marking the 10-day countdown to the games stating that:\n\nThough the PRC publicly claimed in 2001 that it would improve human rights in China, Amnesty International stated in 2008 that, \"In the run-up to the Olympics, the Chinese authorities have locked up, put under house arrest and forcibly removed individuals they believe may threaten the image of “stability” and “harmony” they want to present to the world. They must release all imprisoned peaceful activists, allow foreign and national journalists to report freely and make further progress towards the elimination of the death penalty.\" In late July, U.S. senator Sam Brownback announced that he had received evidence (in the form of an official memo from China's Public Security Bureau) that foreign-owned hotels in China had been ordered by the Chinese government to comply with electronic surveillance of guests by installing special equipment (called the Security Management System for Internet Access from Public Places), or face \"severe retaliation.\"\nOn July 30, 2008, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution by 419 votes to 1 that called for immediate action to stop the arrests of civil activists and Tibetans and to put pressure on China to stop supporting Burma and Sudan.\n\nDespite initial guarantees of total press freedom by the PRC in 2001, and assurances from the IOC in early 2008 that journalists would have unfettered access to the internet, the Beijing Organizing Committee announced in late July that China would allow only \"convenient\" access —still blocking web sites the PRC deemed inappropriate, particularly those critical of China's involvement in Tibet, Darfur, Burma, the 1989 protests at Tiananmen Square, and HIV/AIDS issues in China, as well as its crackdown on spiritual groups such as Falun Gong. Chinese authorities have also blocked passports for foreign journalists. The government justified these action by claiming that these journalists were planning to report on political topics rather than the Olympics, and stated on July 31 that \"The Chinese government won't allow the spread of any information that is forbidden by law or harms national interests on the Internet.\"\nThe NGO, Human Rights Watch has alleged that China has failed to keep its press freedom promise, and one IOC committee member commented anonymously that \"Had the I.O.C...known seven years ago that there would be severe restrictions...then I seriously doubt whether Beijing would have been awarded the Olympics\".\n\nOn August 1, 2008, the IOC announced that the Chinese organizers BOCOG had agreed to lift all Internet restrictions for media covering the Beijing Games. \"The issue has been solved,\" vice-president Gunilla Lindberg said. \"The IOC Coordination Commission and BOCOG met last night and agreed. Internet use will be just like in any Olympics.\"\n\nChina pledged to \"Deliver Clean Energy Towards a Harmonious World\" and that by 2008, measurements of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide would meet World Health Organization standards and airborne particle density would be reduced to the level of major cities in developed countries, however the IOC stated that Beijing had so far met only WHO 2005 interim guidelines, which are significantly less restrictive, and that \"Official data during the Aug. 8 to Aug. 24 Olympic period indicates air quality was actually worse in 2006 and 2007 than in 2000 and 2001.\" An analysis of August 2007 data found that Beijing's air registered 123 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter, more than double the WHO guideline of 50 micrograms per cubic meter for short-term exposure. China's initial failure prior to the games to meet these standards has caused concern among some Olympics athletes, particularly long distance runners such as world marathon record holder Haile Gebrselassie, considered the world's greatest long distance runner, who has said he will skip the long-distance running event in Beijing because of the city's poor air quality and fears his health could be damaged by running through the streets of the Chinese capital, a decision he would later regret. Despite the initial concerns over the air quality, the Beijing air had improved to healthy levels of particle matter by the first week of the games, and officials stated that the particles were actually mostly caused by moisture.\n\n\n\n"}

Soft security can refer to immediate security measures, such as silent burglar alarms or motion detectors, but often refers to more elaborate social security systems such as the \"moral network\" in a tightly-knit community — for example, a cluster of friends on a busy city street.\n\nThe term has gained widespread use in wiki communities, notably MeatballWiki.\n\nThe differentiation between \"soft security\" and \"hard security\" was first made by Rasmusson and Jansson who used the term hard security for traditional mechanisms like authentication and access control, and soft security for social control mechanisms.\n\nThere is a difference between the related concepts of quality control and soft security. Soft security attempts to discourage harm and mitigate any damage, while quality control attempts to improve a product and weed out non-conforming output. The social controls on the production of Wikipedia documents demonstrate both principles, using discussion pages, accessible edit histories, , in contrast to traditional document control mechanisms such as workflow and authorization, to achieve both soft security and quality control.\n\nIn commercial security, soft security is often achieved through training of staff to manage the environment (1) to make disruptions more noticeable, (2) to make disruptions less \"socially\" acceptable, and (3) to create a perceived \"vested interest\" in the public.\n\n"}

The band is known primarily for its strong anti-war lyrics.\n\nThe band's history begins in 1968, when a play titled \"Atomsko sklonište\" and directed by Boško Obradović premiered in People's Theatre in Pula. The play featured a choice of the world anti-war poetry, including two of Obradović's poems: \"Kuga u Danangu\" (against Vietnam War) and \"Vaclavske Namjesti\" (against Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia). For several years Obradović had an idea of a rock band performing songs featuring his lyrics, and in 1977, in front of the kafana Jadran in Pula, which was a gathering place for local musicians, he offered his lyrics to a group of musicians. The agreement was soon made, and the band Atomsko Sklonište was officially formed on February 26, 1977. The first lineup of the band featured Bruno Langer (a former Beat Stones, Fantomi, Logaritmi, and Boomerang member, bass guitar), Sergio Blažić (vocals), Dragan Gužvan (guitar), Eduard Kancelar (keyboards), Saša Dadić (drums), and Rudolf Grum (backing vocals). Blažić, Gužvan and Dadić previously performed together in the band Hush.\n\nThe made their first success with a performance on the 1977 BOOM Festival in Novi Sad. In the spring of 1978 they performed at Festival Omladina, and during the same year their debut album \"Ne cvikaj, generacijo\" (\"Don't Be Afraid, My Generation\") was released. The album featured hard rock sound, with anti-war and cataclysmic lyrics, heavily inspired by hippie ideology, which even in Yugoslavia had already been discarded. The album brought hits \"Pomorac sam, majko\", \"Kinematograf našeg detinjstva\" and \"Ne cvikaj, generacijo\". The band gained the publics attention with the statements that they perform punk, unusual clothing style and photographs made by the photographer Tone Stojko from Maribor. The band would later record music for the song \"Zaspao si u mojoj kosi\", released by Stojko's wife Neca Falk.\n\nThe band's second album, \"Infarkt\" (\"Heart Attack\") was released with a book of photographs by Stojko, and featured hits \"Pakleni vozači\" and \"Djevojka br. 8\". After the album release Kancelar left the band due to his studies, and was replaced by Paul Bičandžić. The band maintained their popularity on their live appearances which featured unusual scenery, such as barbed wire, and during a concert in Tivoli Hall in Ljubljana there were three hundred yellow umbrellas opened above the stage, referring to the band's song \"Žuti kišobran\" (\"Yellow Umbrella\"). The band gained a loyal fanbase, although the critics generally did not like the lyrics written by Obradović. The band recorded their third album \"U vremenu horoskopa\" (\"During the Time of Horoscope\") on the peninsula Stoja near Pula, in the Mobile One mobile studio, previously used by AC/DC. The album was produced by John Etchells and Bill Ainsworth. At the time Bilandžić left the band ant formed the band Lilihip, and Atomsko sklonište continued as a quartet.\n\nIn 1980 the band recorded the live album \"Atomska trilogija\" (\"Nuclear Trilogy\") on a concert in Dom JNA in Pula. In 1981 they released their fourth studio album \"Extrauterina\" (\"Ectopic Pregnancy\"), recorded with Etchells and Ainsworth as the producers in the Super Bear Studio, located in a monastery in the French Alps, and previously used by Elton John, Kate Bush, Pink Floyd, and Van Morrison. The album featured the band's new drummer Zdravko Širola. After the album was released the band ended their cooperation with Boško Obradović.\n\nLanger became the band leader and the songwriter. In 1982 the band released the album \"Mentalna higijena\" (\"Mental Hygiene\"), recorded at the JAM Studio in London. The album featured Mel Collins on saxophone as a guest. During the same year the band went to Florida, where they recorded the album \"Space Generation\" for the foreign market. The album featured nine old Atomsko sklonište songs with English language lyrics written by Dražen Met Premet. The band released the album through EEC under the name Atomic Shelter. In 1984 the band released the album \"Zabranjeno snivanje\" (\"Forbidden Dreaming\"). The live album \"Jednom u životu\" (\"Once in a Lifetime\"), recorded on the concert held at Tašmajdan Stadium on September 15, 1984, and released in 1985, was the last album featuring Blažić on vocals. The band had the last performance with him on July 21, 1986, after which he died on January 18, 1987.\n\nIn 1986 Langer and Gužvan recorded the English language album \"This Spaceship\" and released it under the name Atomic Shelter. The album featured American musicians Wes Talton (vocals), Freddie Stuckey (keyboards) and David Pressley (drums). The album featured six old rerecorded Atomsko sklonište songs and four new songs.\n\nAt the end of 1987 Atomsko sklonište continued performing in the new lineup: Langer (vocals and bass guitar), Ranko Svorcan (guitar) and Nikola Duraković (drums). In 1990 the band released the album \"Criminal Tango\". In August 1991, at the time when military conflicts in Yugoslavia had already begun, Atomsko sklonište performed on Gitarijada festival in Zaječar, Serbia. In 1992 the band released the album \"East Europe Man\", featuring Wes Talon on vocals. The song \"Chinese Bike\" entered the \"\"Billboard\" Hot 100\". In 1995 the band released the studio album \"Terra Mistica\". In 1999 Nikola Duraković was replaced by Stjepan Bobić (a former Nola, The Spoons, and Messerschmitt member).\n\nIn 2003 One Records released the DVD entitled \"Atomsko sklonište\", which features a collection of their videos and a recording of their performance at the 1991 Gitarijada festival.\n\nThe album \"Ne cvikaj, generacijo\" was polled in 1998 as 47th on the list of 100 greatest Yugoslav popular music albums in the book \"\" (\"YU 100: The Best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music\").\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a pastor and spiritual father of high reputation and a reputed wonderworker to whom were attributed great powers of prophecy, clairvoyance and healing. He is often referred to simply as \"St. John the Wonderworker\".\n\nBorn in 1896 in the village of Adamovka in the Kharkov Governorate (in present-day eastern Ukraine). He came from the same family of Serbian origin as that of St. John of Tobolsk, whom he was said to resemble in several respects. From 1907 to 1914 he attended Poltava Military School. He received a degree in law from Kharkov Imperial University in 1918. His family brought him to Belgrade in 1921, where in 1925 he graduated from Belgrade University with a degree in theology.\nIn 1926 he was tonsured a monk and ordained a hierodeacon by Russian Metropolitan Anthony (Khrapovitsky), who gave him the name of St. John after his saintly relative. Later that same year, he was ordained to the priesthood by Russian Bishop Gabriel (Chepur) of Chelyabinsk. For several years afterward he worked as an instructor and tutor in Yugoslavia. He worked as a religious teacher in the Gymnasium of Velika Kikinda between 1925 and 1927. In 1929, Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church appointed him a teacher of the seminary in Bitola. The principal of the seminary was Nikolaj Velimirović.\n\nIn 1934 he was ordained a bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia by Metropolitan Anthony and assigned to the diocese of Shanghai.\n\nIn Shanghai, Holy Bishop St. John found an uncompleted cathedral and an Orthodox community deeply divided along ethnic lines. Making contact with all the various groups, he quickly involved himself in the existing charitable institutions and personally founded an orphanage and home for the children of indigents. Here he first became known for miracles attributed to his prayer. As a public figure it was impossible for him to completely conceal his ascetic way of life. Despite his actions during the Japanese occupation, when he routinely ignored the curfew in pursuit of his pastoral activities, the Japanese authorities never harassed him. As the only Russian hierarch in China who refused to submit to the authority of the Soviet-dominated Russian Orthodox Church, he was elevated to Archbishop of China by the Holy Synod of ROCOR in 1946.\n\nWhen the Communists took power in China, the Russian colony was forced to flee, first to a refugee camp on the island of Tubabao in the Philippines and then mainly to the United States and Australia. Archbishop St. John travelled personally to Washington, D.C. to ensure that his people would be allowed to enter the country.\n\nIn 1951 St. John was assigned to the archdiocese of Western Europe with his see first in Paris, then in Brussels. Thanks to his work in collecting lives of saints, a great many pre-Schism Western saints became known in Orthodoxy and continue to be venerated to this day. His charitable and pastoral work continued as it had in Shanghai, even among a much more widely scattered flock.\n\nIn 1962 St. John was once again reassigned by the Holy Synod to the see of San Francisco. Here too, he found a divided community and a cathedral in an unfinished state. Although he completed the building of the Holy Virgin Cathedral and brought some measure of peace to the community he became the target of slander from those who became his political enemies, who went so far as to file a lawsuit against him for alleged mishandling of finances related to construction of the cathedral. He was exonerated, but this was a great cause of sorrow to him in his later life.\n\nDeeply revering St. John of Kronstadt, St. John Maximovitch played an active role in preparation of his canonization.\n\nOn July 2, 1966 (June 19 on the Julian calendar), St. John died while visiting Seattle at a time and place he was said to have foretold. He was entombed in a sepulchre beneath the altar of the Holy Virgin Cathedral he had built in San Francisco dedicated to the Theotokos, Joy of All Who Sorrow, on Geary Boulevard in the Richmond district. In 1994 he was solemnly glorified on the 28th anniversary of his death. His unembalmed, incorrupt relics now occupy a shrine in the cathedral's nave. His feast day is celebrated on the Saturday nearest to July 2. He is beloved and celebrated worldwide, with portions of his relics located in Serbia, Russia, Mount Athos, Greece (Church of Saint Anna in Katerini) Bulgaria, Romania, United States (St. John Maximovitch Church, Eugene, Oregon), Canada (Holy Trinity Serbian Orthodox Church, Kitchener), England (Dormition Cathedral of the Russian Orthodox Church, London) and other countries of the world.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2185288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2185288", "title": "Ludwig Cancer Research", "text": "Ludwig Cancer Research\n\nLudwig Cancer Research is an international community of scientists focused on cancer research, with the goals of preventing and controlling cancer. It encompasses the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, an international non-profit organization founded in 1971 by philanthropist Daniel K. Ludwig. The Institute is headquartered in New York City with a European office located in Zurich. In addition, six Ludwig Centers were established at leading US cancer research institutions. Together, the Institute and Centers are known as Ludwig Cancer Research.\n\nSince its founding in 1971, Ludwig Cancer Research has committed more than (US) $2.5 billion to cancer research. Ludwig Cancer Research focuses on both basic research and translational research, with specific emphasis on cell biology, genomics, immunology, neuroscience, prevention, cell signaling, stem cells, therapeutics, and tumor biology, as well as clinical trials and the design and development of small molecules with drug-like properties. Its researchers also focus on particular types of malignancy, including brain cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma.\n\nDaniel K. Ludwig was a shipping magnate and real estate investor. Born in South Haven, Michigan in 1897, he parleyed a $5,000 loan from his father into a global business empire based on a fleet of supertankers. In the 1960s and 1970s, Ludwig was among the richest men in the world, with a self-made empire of some 200 companies globally.\n\nHe founded the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research as an independent organization in 1971, the same year that the “War on Cancer,” declared by his friend President Richard Nixon, led to the establishment of the US National Cancer Institute. Ludwig believed that tackling the problem of cancer required the best minds operating in the most favorable conditions with the best resources to accomplish the task. This principle continues to guide Ludwig Cancer Research.\n\nDaniel K. Ludwig endowed the Institute with all of the foreign assets from his business holdings. Upon his death in 1992, that endowment had grown to more than $700 million, and it stands at more than $1.3 billion today.\n\nAfter Ludwig’s death, his US-based assets were also put into a trust to support additional cancer research efforts. These funds led to the establishment of Ludwig Centers at six research institutions in 2006. The Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and Ludwig Centers have been known collectively as Ludwig Cancer Research since 2012. In total, Ludwig Cancer Research has committed more than (US) $2.5 billion to cancer research worldwide since 1971.\n\nThe primary objectives of Ludwig Cancer Research are to prevent and control cancer through basic and translational research.\n\nLloyd Old, the organization’s former director and scientific chairman, participated in the discovery of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and the tumor suppressor p53. He contributed to the immunosurveillance hypothesis, from which modern cancer immunotherapy can be derived.\n\nThierry Boon, former director of the organization’s Brussels branch, made foundational contributions to the field of cancer immunotherapy. The prevailing model of carcinogenesis in the late 1970s held that spontaneously arising tumors were unlikely to elicit immune responses. Boon and his team, who believed otherwise, were the first to isolate genes that code for a family of tumor antigens and show that T cells could recognize and target cancer cells bearing such antigens. This theory is being tested in a number of current clinical trials.\n\nLudwig researchers in Melbourne discovered and cloned the granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) through a collaboration with Australian immunologist Donald Metcalf. The factor is essential to the maturation of key white blood cells, and has been used extensively over the past few decades to help rebuild the immune system of patients undergoing chemotherapy. It is also being tested as a therapeutic agent in combination with several experimental immunotherapies for cancer. The Oncology Drug Advisory Committee of the US FDA recently recommended approval for T-VEC, a viral therapy for melanoma manufactured by Amgen that incorporates the gene for GM-CSF to support anti-cancer immune responses.\n\nLudwig researchers in Sao Paulo played a role in establishing that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection causes cervical cancer. They ran the largest epidemiological studies of HPV infection and reported that chronic, though not transient, infection by the virus dramatically increases the risk of cervical cancer, laying the groundwork for the clinical development of an HPV vaccine.\n\nCurrent and former Ludwig researchers contributed to an emerging class of cancer immunotherapies known as checkpoint inhibitors. They explored the underlying immunology of the response and played a role in evaluating the first such drug in clinical trials for the treatment of advanced melanoma. This led the development of new criteria for evaluating responses of cancer patients to immunotherapy in clinical trials.\n\nContributions to the field of cell signaling include the identification of signaling pathways and subsequent development of therapies. An example is the PI3K family of proteins, which play a key role in cell signaling that fuels cancer. This research led to the first Ludwig spin-off, a biotech named Piramed Ltd., which sought to develop cancer therapies based on this discovery. The company was purchased by the pharmaceutical company Roche. Drugs based on these discoveries are today being tested to treat several types of cancer, including breast and lung cancer.\n\nContributions in the field of genomics include the work of Ludwig researchers at Johns Hopkins to sequence the full complement of genes expressed in many cancers, including head and neck, colon, and breast cancers, as well as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Ludwig researchers in San Diego significantly advanced studies of the epigenome, leading such efforts as the NIH’s Roadmap Epigenomics Project.\n\nThe Ludwig Cancer Research board of directors helps oversee both the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and the Ludwig Fund. Although each of these entities has its own board, the boards comprise the same individuals. The current chairman of the board is John L. Notter, an international financier and developer affiliated with a variety of companies, including Westlake Properties, Inc.\n\nThe executive staff manages the organization's worldwide efforts. Edward A. McDermott, Jr has been with the organization since 1988 and its CEO since 2010.\n\nIt was announced in December 2016 that Chi Van Dang will take over the role of Scientific Director in July 2017. He will be responsible for coordinating the organization’s global research efforts and activities.\n\nNotable awards received by past and present employees affiliated with Ludwig include:\n\nNational Medal of Science (US):\n\nFellows of the National Academy of Sciences (US):\n\nAcademy of Medical Sciences (UK):\n\nBranches and laboratories\n\n\nLudwig Centers\n\n\n"}

Its name means \"\"Flying Squad\"\" in Croatian. They formed in 1991 with Denis Dumančić.\n\nTheir serious music career group began in 1992, when it was discovered by Husein Hasanefendić, known as Hus, a recognized and reputable author and leader of the Parni Valjak who along with Marijan Brkic-Brko stood behind the project and the ability to shoot and issuance of original songs by Denis Dumančić. The first inaugural album by Leteći Odred, titled \"Među Zvijezdama\" (Among the stars) was released in late 1992. Among the 10 or so highly acclaimed songs were \"Neka Neveni ne venu\" (Don't let marigold wither) and \"Kao stari moj\" (As my old man) that were well received by the audience and the media. In 1993, Leteći Odred performed at the first Croatian Eurovision i.e. \"\"Crovizija\"\" with the song \"Cijeli je svijet zaljubljen\" (The whole world is in love).\n\nIn late 1994, Leteći Odred released an album, titled \"Kada Odletim\" (When I fly away) issued by the label \"\"Orfej\"\". Some of notable songs were \"Ja se budim\" (I'm waking up) and \"U mojoj glavi ima sudara\" (There's crashes in my head) and the song \"Heroji ne plaču\" (Heroes don't cry) written by Miroslav Škoro, and performed in duet.\n\nIn 1995, Leteći Odred performed at the Croatian Eurovision i.e. \"\"Crovizija\"\", with the song \"Pišem ti pismo\" (I'm writing you a letter).\n\nIn 1996, Leteći Odred released their third album titled \"Od Prevlake do Dunava\" (From Prevlaka to Dunav). Songs like \"Od Prevlake do Dunava\" (From Prevlaka to Dunav), \"Kao ja ne kužim\" (Like I don't get it), \"Teta\" (Aunt), \"Večeras je dušo rođendan tvoj\" (Tonight is your birthday, Honey), \"Uzalud je mjesečina\" (Moonlight is in vain) and \"A bez vina\" (Without wine) became big hits. The album sold more than 20,000 copies and the band then started a major promotional tour in Croatia, Slovenia, Germany, Switzerland and Austria, as part of which held more than a hundred concerts and lasting for a year.

Asked if he could continue to produce the strip, Blake told an interviewer, \"Sure, I could keep doing it. But I can’t. I’ve had enough.\" After Blake retired, the strip continued to appear as reprints, and as of December 2005, according to the syndicate, \"Tiger\" was running in more than 100 newspapers in 11 countries.\n\n\"Tiger\" followed a gag-a-day format and was designed to appeal to both adults and children. It centered on a scrappy group of school-aged kids in an unidentified, middle-class neighborhood. Parents and teachers were occasionally referred to, but no adult was ever pictured. \"Tiger\" was told from a child's perspective and retained its innocent kids' eye world view from beginning to end.\n\n\nThe National Cartoonists Society named \"Tiger\" the best humor strip in 1970, 1978 and 2000, with an additional nomination in 1998.\n\nComics artist Joe Kubert said of Blake, \"I know his work, and I've always enjoyed it.

The other shortlisted cities were Pyeongchang and Salzburg. Although Bern was originally shortlisted along with Vancouver, Pyeongchang and Salzburg, a referendum held in September 2002 revealed that a majority of the citizens of Bern did not support pursuing the candidacy. There were four other cities vying for the hosting honour, that had been dropped by the International Olympic Committee: Andorra la Vella, Harbin, Jaca and Sarajevo.\n\nVancouver won the bidding process to host the Olympics by a vote of the International Olympic Committee on July 2, 2003 at the 115th IOC Session held in Prague, Czech Republic. Earlier in February, Vancouver's residents voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid. Sixty-four percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games. In neighboring Washington state to the south, both the state legislature and Governor Gary Locke passed a resolution in support of Vancouver's bid, and sent it to the IOC.\n\nEight cities applied to host the games. Those cities were (in the order of drawing the lots):\n\nEach city was required to answer a twenty-two question questionnaire.\n\nThe IOC Candidature Acceptance Working Group, which evaluated the applications divided their recommendations into eleven areas.\n\nEach cell of the table provides a minimum and a maximum figure obtained by the applicant city on the specific criteria. These figures are to be compared to a benchmark which has been set at 6.\n\nFour cities were named Candidate Cities: Bern, Pyeongchang (which both met the benchmark), Salzburg, and Vancouver (which both exceeded it). They made additional comments with respect to Bern and Pyeongchang. As for Bern, they felt the bid had significant organizational difficulties and the financial plan's feasibility was dependent on a popular referendum. As for Pyeongchang, the resort area of Yongpyong required further development.\n\nIn September, a referendum ended Bern's chances of winning.\n\nEach candidate city was required to answer a 199-question questionnaire.\nAfter the withdrawal of Bern, the IOC Evaluation Commission visited the three remaining cities on the following dates:\n\nThere were two rounds of voting at the convention that decided which city would host the games. In the first round Pyeongchang received 51 votes, while Vancouver received 40 and Salzburg with only 26 votes, thus eliminating them in the first round. In the second and final round of voting, Vancouver received 56 votes to Pyeongchang's 53, which proved to be the difference in margin of victory and the closest vote for an Olympic city host since Sydney, Australia beat Beijing, China by 2 votes for the 2000 Summer Olympics.\n\nAcross Canada, and especially in the province of British Columbia, celebrations broke out amidst the announcement made by IOC President Jacques Rogge, as evidenced on the CBC, by the network's chief correspondent, Peter Mansbridge. While Vancouver and the rest of British Columbia celebrated, the mood was bittersweet in Toronto which had aspirations to host the 2012 Summer Olympics which were awarded to London. Canada's largest city has already lost bids to host the 1996 and 2008 Summer Olympics to Atlanta and Beijing. The announcement came the day after Canada celebrated its 136th birthday, with Canada Day. With ice hockey being their pastime, some of the people at GM Place said that winning an Olympic Games is far greater than winning a Stanley Cup when they heard the announcement. Wayne Gretzky made this evident in Prague, as he served as an ambassador and contributor to the games and was part of the presentation team.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2185322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2185322", "title": "Gekkeiju Online", "text": "Gekkeiju Online\n\n\"Gekkeiju Online\" was a GameOgre.com online game of the week, highlighting the MUD-style gameplay which is considered more in-depth than regular MMORPGs.\n\nA completely redone version of Gekkeiju Online launched to public beta test in January 2010.\n\nThe game's character options consist of nine playable character races, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. The playable races are: humans, elves, halflings, half-giants, dwarves, wild elves, dark elves, goblins and catfolk.\n\nIt's possible to change the race during playing through reincarnation offered by various NPCs in game. This is also the only way to get access to some of the races.\n\nThere are 5 character classes available in Gekkeiju Online - warrior, commoner, magic user, divine arts and dark arts. Each of the character classes has its own set of guilds that can be joined to learn skills and spells. The character class also decides the skills and spells character learns automatically during the first 10 levels.\n\nWarrior is the very basic fighter class. Their guilds specialize in melee, ranged attacks and animal taming. New players always start as warriors.\n\nCommoners are a combinations of spell casters and fighters. Their guilds include for example bards and merchants.\n\nMagic Users are the strongest users of magic. They can learn spells from defensive to offensive.\n\nDivine Arts are a spellcaster class that uses divine spiritual magic such as healing-spells. Divine arts can also learn some combat skills.\n\nDark Arts are the evil counterpart of divine arts. Dark Arts spells are focused on damage used to supplement melee combat skill. Their guilds include death knights and fallen priests.\n\nAdvancement of character in Gekkeiju Online happens by gaining experience points by either solving quests or by killing monsters. The advancement, however, doesn't happen automatically but player needs to purchase character levels with the gained experience points which can be done at level trainer NPCs.\n\nCharacter will automatically learn skills during the first 10 levels every time after level advancement. However, starting at level 10 the only way to learn skills and spells is to join a guild. It's then possible to train skills in the guild with experience points. This means that starting at level 10 player needs to choose between level and skill advancement.\n\nPlayer versus player (PvP) killing in Gekkeiju Online is nearly free and without other than game enforced limitations. The limitations help those who do not like player killing. The maps in the game are divided into different PvP types:-- Guarded and PvP. \n\nGuarded maps allow players to fight each other but attacking will flag the attacking player as criminal. Guarded areas also always have guard NPCs that hunt down all criminal players. Criminal players will drop their whole inventory on ground and be teleported into jail when killed. The jail time depends on the number of players killed in a guarded map.\n\nIn PvP maps fighting is allowed but slightly limited. If the attacked player doesn't retaliate before being killed by a player, the attacker will be flagged as murderer. The only way to remove the murderer flag is to gain experience points by killing monsters. Murderers also have a small chance of dropping some of their items when killed.\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1984 in Vinkovci, Majke were one of the many bands to appear in a town that had a particularly vibrant rock and alternative scene. The band started playing under the influence of bands like: MC5, Flamin' Groovies, Steppenwolf, The Stooges, New York Dolls and many others.\n\nMajke were formed in 1984 in Vinkovci, Croatia by vocalist Goran Bare, bassist Nedjeljko Ivković - Kilmister, drummer Željko Mikulić - Korozija, and guitarists Marin Pokrovac and Ivica Duspara. They released their first demo tape in 1988 on the label Slušaj Najglasnije. The following year, some of their early recordings appeared on the legendary Slušaj Najglasnije compilation album \"Bombardiranje New Yorka\", which mainly consisted of recordings of rock bands from Vinkovci.\n\nThe band briefly broke up after Pokrovac moved to London. However, he soon returned to Vinkovci, and the band reformed. The reunion was tragically cut short after Pokrovac's death in 1989 when he crashed his car into the Bosut river while returning from rehearsal. Two friends of the band, Pavo Pap and Goran Matošević - Bratanac, died in the crash as well.\n\nThe band decided to continue without Pokrovac. They recruited new guitarist Ivan Dujmić, and in 1990, they released their first studio album, \"Razum I Bezumlje\", on the independent label Search & Enjoy. The album displayed a raw and aggressive punk-influenced garage rock style, and featured several live staples such as \"Iz Sve Snage\", \"Zbunjen I Ošamućen\", \"Lutak Iskrivljenog Lica\", \"Nikada Te Neću Zaboraviti\" and \"Putujem\". Bare wrote the lyrics, while Duspara wrote all of the music on the album. The album was proclaimed rock album of the year by domestic audiences. However, the band's success was suddenly interrupted by the start of the Croatian War of Independence, with Vinkovci being one of the frontlines. The band soon broke up.\n\nBare relocated to Zagreb, and in 1992, assembled a new Majke lineup consisting of original drummer Korozija, guitarist and primary songwriter Zoran Čalić, and bassist Jurica Nižić. The band recorded their second studio album \"Razdor\", in 1993, which was released on T.R.I.P., a sub-label of Croatia Records. The album contained famous songs such as \"Budi Ponosan\", \"Krvarim Od Dosade\", \"Mršavi Pas\", \"'89\" and \"Fantastična Vatra\".\n\nAround this time, second guitarist Davor Viduka joined the band, though he did not play on Razdor. However, he and Nižić both left the band due to personal disagreements with Bare. They went on to form the successful rock band Kojoti.\n\nIn late 1993, original bassist Kilmister returned to the band, and second guitarist Goran Dujmić joined. The band released their third studio album \"Milost\" the following year, on the label Heroina Nova. Despite Bare considering it to be one of Majke's weaker albums, the song \"Ja Sam Budućnost\" became a hit, and a music video was filmed for it. Deceased guitarist Marin Pokrovac received a posthumous writing credit for the song \"Postoji Nešto\", while original guitarist Ivica Duspara received a writing credit for \"Zauvijek\". Dujmić also received writing credits for \"Znam Ono Što Treba Da Znam\" and \"Oslobodi Se\". That same year, after the birth of his son, Bare checked into rehab for heroin addiction and was clean by the summer of 1995.\n\nIn 1995, the band briefly broke up, though Bare spent several months performing under the name Majke, with members of Kojoti as his backing band. Around this time, Bare's wife died after overdosing on heroin. Bare fell into a deep depression and started using heroin again as well as drinking heavily to cope with his wife's death.\n\nLate that year, the band reformed with a new lineup: Bare on vocals, Kilmister on bass, Čalić and Kruno Domaćinović on guitars, and Tihomir Jalšovec - Chaka on drums. The band released \"Vrijeme Je Da Se Krene\", their fourth and most commercially successful studio album, on Jabukaton records in 1996. Originally intended to be an EP, this album displayed a softer blues rock sound compared to their old, more aggressive garage rock style. The album had a much more sorrowful feel to it as the band was going through difficult times while recording the album, with Bare dealing with his wife's death, depression and addiction, as well as Kilmister's father dying in the middle of recording. The band utilized session musicians Davor Rodik and Gojko Tomljanović to play pedal steel guitar and keyboards, respectively. The album contained several hits, the most famous being \"Mene Ne Zanima\", \"Odvedi Me\" and \"A Ti Još Plačeš\". A music video was filmed for Mene Ne Zanima, which won a Porin award. The title track and \"Baretov Blues\" became live staples as well, while original guitarist Ivica Duspara received a writing credit for \"Nije Lako\".\n\nThe next year, the band released their first live album \"Život Uživo\", recorded at the concert venue Dom Sportova on April 25th, 1997. The following year, the band won two Crni Mačak awards for best rock artist and best live performance.\n\nIn 1998, the band filmed a music video for a new song called \"Daj Mi\", announcing a new studio album. The band's fifth studio album, \"Put Do Srca Sunca\", was released later that year. This album was more complex and experimental, with some songs featuring a pedal steel guitar, a Hammond organ, congas, and even a horn section. The album contained the hit single \"Grešnik\", for which a music video was filmed.\n\nA few months after the album's release, Chaka left the band and was replaced by Thomas Balaž, who previously played in the bands Anesthesia, Divlje Jagode and Teško Vrijeme, an early incarnation of Hard Time. The live album Život Uživo won a Porin award for best alternative rock album. Shortly after the Porin awards, guitarist Zoran Čalić left the band, later citing Bare's alcohol and drug abuse as one of the main reasons for his departure. The next year, Put Do Srca Sunca won a Crni Mačak award for the best cover art.\n\nNear the end of 1999, the band recorded a new version of the song \"Budi Ponosan\" from their second studio album, \"Razdor\", to mark the band's 15th anniversary. Around this time, Bare checked into rehab for heroin addiction again, and was clean by the following year.\n\nIn the spring of 2000, the band announced that they were breaking up once again. However, they still played several shows throughout the summer due to contractual obligations, and they played their final show at Bike October Fest on September 30th, 2000.\n\nAfter the breakup, Bare embarked on a successful solo career, releasing his first album, \"Izgubljen I Nađen\", in 2001, recorded with his backing band Plaćenici. Meanwhile, Čalić and Kilmister formed the band Elektrobuda, releasing an album titled \"Sveti Zvuk\" in 2005.\n\nIn 2007, after seven years of inactivity, most of the \"Vrijeme je da se krene\" lineup reunited under the moniker Goran Bare & Majke, with ex-Laufer drummer Alen Tibljaš replacing Chaka. Tibljaš had also previously played with Bare in his backing band, Plaćenici. The band also recruited Cota G4 keyboardist Danko Krznarić. They played their first show since 2000 at the famous venue Tvornica Kulture in Zagreb on March 8th, which was recorded for a live album that would not be released until 2013.\n\nKrznarić soon left the band and was replaced by Parni Valjak keyboardist Berislav Blažević, who previously worked with Bare during his solo career, and also played keyboards on the band's 1999 re-recording of Budi Ponosan. On April 12th 2008, the band played a well received acoustic show at Tvornica Kulture, which was recorded and released as the live album \"Majke Unplugged\". The band continued performing live around the country, and began talks of recording a new studio album.\n\nBy the end of 2009, Kilmister, Domaćinović, Tibljaš and Blažević left the band due to personal differences with Bare. This left Bare as the only remaining original member of Majke. He and Čalić assembled a new lineup consisting of bassist Mario Rašić, who previously played with Bare in his backing band Plaćenici; Gatuzo guitarist Damir Trkulja - Šiljo, drummer Damir Šomen and keyboardist Viktor Lipić. This lineup recorded the band's sixth studio album, \"Teške Boje\", which was released in 2011. On this album, the band displayed a much darker and more aggressive style of blues rock, with psychedelic elements mixed in as well. The title track was a hit, with some critics even calling it the \"best Croatian rock song of the last 20 years\", and a music video was filmed for it. Other staples from the album included \"Pozovi Me U Noć\" and \"Depresija\". In 2012, the album won several Porin awards for song of the year, best rock album, and best music video of the year. Soon afterwards, Šiljo left the band due to personal issues with Bare and was replaced by ex-Pips, Chips i Videoclips guitarist Alen Kraljić, who also played with Bare as a member of Plaćenici.\n\nIn 2013, the band released the live album \"Majke U Tvornici\", which was recorded six years ago at the Tvornica Kulture. By the end of the year, Zoran Čalić left the band once again. He went on to form a new band called Zoran Čalić Bend. Meanwhile, Bare would keep Majke going, and the band would spend the next few years going through various personnel changes until finally assembling a stable lineup once again. At one point, the band featured two members of Kojoti; bassist Vanja Marin and keyboardist Dan Divjak, who passed away in 2017.\n\nOn December 28th, 2016, the \"Vrijeme Je Da Se Krene\" lineup briefly reunited at the cult Zagreb alternative nightclub Jabuka to promote the remastered version of Vrijeme Je Da Se Krene. It was the first time Bare and Kilmister spoke since 2009, as well as former drummer Chaka's first public appearance since his departure from the band in 1998.\n\nBy 2018, after years of lineup changes and rarely playing live, Bare finally assembled a stable lineup of the band once again. Guitarist Kruno Domaćinović returned to the band, along with drummer Alen Tibljaš and keyboardist Berislav Blažević. Bassist Mario Rašić returned as well, and longtime collaborator and pedal steel guitarist Davor Rodik joined the band as a permanent second guitarist.\n\nIn 2018, the new Majke lineup released their long awaited seventh studio album, \"Nuspojave\". This album featured a softer, more experimental and complex style compared to their previous work, with Bare comparing it to Lou Reed's work. The album contained the singles \"Osvijesti Me\", \"Ljubav Krvari\", \"To Nije Igra\" and \"Zašto\", and a music video was filmed for Osvijesti Me. The band played a well-received show at the Tvornica Kulture on November 9th, 2018. A music video for To Nije Igra was filmed during the show. In 2019, the band performed a show backed by an orchestra at the Šalata stadium in Zagreb on June 1st, the Ferragosto Jam festival on August 2nd, and another show at Tvornica Kulture on November 24th.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

When evident clinically, the condition is usually massive. The onset of pulmonary hemorrhage is characterized by cough productive of blood (hemoptysis) and worsening of oxygenation leading to cyanosis. Treatment should be immediate and should include tracheal suction, oxygen, positive pressure ventilation, and correction of underlying abnormalities (e.g. disorders of coagulation). A blood transfusion may be necessary.\n\nInfant prematurity is the factor most commonly associated with pulmonary hemorrhage. Other associated factors are those that predisposed to perinatal asphyxia or bleeding disorders, including toxemia of pregnancy, maternal cocaine use, erythroblastosis fetalis, breech delivery, hypothermia, infection, Infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), administration of exogenous surfactants (in some studies) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\nAlthough the pathogenesis is uncertain, it is probable that the symptoms are a consequence of hemorrhagic pulmonary edema, as the hematocrit is lower than normal blood (usually 15-20% less) and the concentration of small proteins is higher than in plasma. It is postulated that the infant suffers from asphyxia with resultant heart attack; this increases pulmonary microvascular pressure, resulting in pulmonary edema. Contributing factors include factors that favor increased filtration of fluid from pulmonary capillaries (e.g., low concentration of plasma proteins, high alveolar surface tension, lung damage, hypervolemia).\n\nDiffuse alveolar hemorrhage is bleeding from many alveoli throughout the lungs. Common causes include autoimmune diseases and connective tissue diseases.\nThe outcome of treatment is dependent on causality. Pulmonary Hemorrhage is present in 7 to 10% of neonatal autopsies, but up to 80% of autopsies of very preterm infants. The incidence is 1 in 1,000 live births. Pulmonary hemorrhage has a high mortality rate of 30% to 40%.\n\n"}

She appeared as a bath girl in \"You Only Live Twice\" under the name Yee-Wah Yang.\n\nThe film received generally negative reviews from the \"New York Times\", \"Variety\" and the \"Monthly Film Bulletin\" with the latter two reviews noting that the film could leave audiences with unintentional laughter at its ineptitude. The film was featured on the film-mocking television series \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" in 1993.\n\nWhen a legendary British Intelligence (SIS) agent is murdered, fellow agent Miss Maxwell (Lois Maxwell) is sent to find the late spy's girlfriend, Miss Yashuko (Yashuko Yama), who is unwittingly in possession of valuable information. Maxwell discovers that Yashuko is in the care of Dr. Neil Connery, a cosmetic surgeon who uses hypnotism in his practice. Yashuko is kidnapped from a medical conference in Monte Carlo by Maya Rafis (Daniela Bianchi), as part of a plot by Mr. Thayer (Adolfo Celi), code name Beta, of the terrorist organization THANATOS. The Secret Service's Commander Cunningham (Bernard Lee) assigns Connery to find Miss Yashuko.\n\nConnery hypnotizes a beautiful girl named Mildred (Agata Flori) to acquire information and discovers that Miss Yashuko is located in a Spanish castle belonging to Lotte Krayendorf (Anne-Marie Noé). Connery rescues Miss Yashuko and obtains critical intelligence. This information leads to the discovery of THANATOS's plan to build a super magnet, powerful enough to turn off all mechanical products from New York to Moscow. The weapon is being assembled in a Moroccan rug factory, where all the employees are blind. Miss Yashuko is murdered by Mildred before revealing any further information. Mildred is then killed by Juan (Franco Giacobini), Connery's aide.\n\nAfter arriving in Morocco, Connery is invited by Maya Rafis to a party held by Mr. Thayer. During the reception, Connery discovers that Mr. Thayer is planning to assassinate the head of THANATOS, known as Alpha (Anthony Dawson). Connery warns Maya about his discovery as she leads him to the rug factory. Upon entering the factory, Connery realizes that it is actually producing strands of uranium; the employees' blindness prevents them from discovering their dangerous role. Together, Connery and Maya track the uranium shipment to Switzerland, where Mr. Thayer, having failed to assassinate Alpha, has been driving the development of the powerful magnet. Together, with the help of a team of Scottish archers (as firearms are rendered inoperative by the magnet), Connery and Maya almost completely destroy THANATOS. After the completion of the mission, Commander Cunningham comments to Connery, \"O.K. Connery! You were almost better than your brother.\"\n\n\nNeil Connery was working as a plasterer in Scotland until he was sacked for losing his tools. Based on Neil's relation to his brother Sean, the matter received international media attention. When Terence Young heard Neil interviewed with his trade union about the matter on the radio he mentioned to Italian producer Dario Sabatello that Neil sounded like his brother Sean. Sabatello met Neil at the Caledonian Hotel in Edinburgh to recruit him to play the lead role in a Eurospy film. Neil recalled when he did his screentest the crew kept saying \"OK, Connery, OK\" that became the title for the film.\n\nExperienced director Alberto De Martino who had previously filmed \"Upperseven, the Man to Kill\" and \"Special Mission Lady Chaplin\" (both 1966) recalled his father Romolo de Martino doing Neil's extensive makeup and problems with Neil's inexperience as an actor. He also recalled Sabatello approaching Sean Connery do to an appearance in the film that Connery emphatically refused.\n\nNeil Connery's voice is dubbed by an actor with an American accent. In an interview in Cinema Retro, Neil said that he was undergoing medical treatment when voice dubbing of the film was in progress, leading another person to voice his lines in the English version.\n\nLois Maxwell recalled she earned more money for the film than her combined award wage payments from all her appearances in the Eon Productions 007 films put together.\n\n\"O.K. Connery\" was filmed in Tetuán, Morocco, Monaco and Spain.\n\n\"OK Connery\" was released in Italy in 1967. The film was distributed in the United States by United Artists, the year Sean Connery left the James Bond series, under the title \"Operation Kid Brother\". It was one of six Italian films released worldwide by United Artists in 1967.\n\nOn video release the film had alternate titles which included Operation Double 007, Secret Agent 00 and \"Operation Kid Brother\".\n\n\"O.K. Connery\" was featured on the television series \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" on September 11, 1993 as \"Operation Double 007\".\n\nIn contemporary reviews, Bosley Crowther writing for \"The New York Times\" referred to the film as \"a wobbly carbon copy of the James Bond thrillers\" \"Variety\" described the film as so \"unbelievably inept\", that \"many viewers may find it hilarious fun.\" The \"Monthly Film Bulletin\" stated that \"O.K. Connery\" was a \"grotesque parody of a parody\" noting endless allusions to Neil Connery's brother Sean Connery. The review concluded that \"the film as a whole is bad enough to be hysterically funny.\" \"The Cleveland Press\" referred to the film as a \"dreary and dismal espionage movie\" stating that the film lacked the \"flair and skill with which the Bond films are made. The script is labored, the direction slow and the acting is barely adequate.\"\n\nIn Phil Hardy's book \"Science Fiction\" (1984), a review noted that \"though it's stylishly mounted, the result is a routine Italian spy romp.\"\n\nIn an interview in 1996, Lois Maxwell said that Sean Connery, when he learned that she would join the cast, got very angry and started screaming: \"You have betrayed me!\" but he later forgave her.\n\nAs a \"James Bond rip-off\", reaction to the film is mixed. Ben Child from \"The Guardian\" called it one of the worst movies made for the genre. In contrast, Andy Roberts from \"The Daily Telegraph\" and Tom Cole for \"Radio Times\" considered it to be one of the best.\n\n\n"}

It is located on Rivington Moor, Chorley and is high. Part of the West Pennine Moors, it is a popular walking area, and has been the site of mining activity, aeroplane disasters and murders.\n\nIts prominent position made it the ideal site for the Winter Hill TV Mast, transmitting to a large part of North West England. There is also a number of other telecommunication masts and towers around the summit and side of the hill for mobile phones, Professional Mobile Radio users and emergency services. Lancashire Constabulary was the first to use the site for one of their base stations in 1950; they had to build the road and it is said to have been built by policemen.\n\nPaths to the summit lead from Belmont (in Blackburn with Darwen), Rivington (in Chorley borough), and Horwich and Blackrod (in Bolton borough). The summit can also be reached via a short walk from the top of a road pass west of Belmont. The hill is a prominent feature on the skyline for most of the borough of Chorley and further afield. Winter Hill's topographic prominence results in it being classified as a Marilyn. The trig point on its summit marks the highest point in Blackburn with Darwen whereas the highest point in the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton is away on its south east slope at above sea level.\n\nIt offers views over Lancashire and the Greater Manchester Urban Area, including Manchester city centre, Salford, Werneth Low, Wigan and Bolton. In clear weather conditions, it also offers views of Blackpool Tower, Jodrell Bank Observatory, Snaefell in the Isle of Man, the Cumbrian mountains, Snowdonia in North Wales, Liverpool, Southport, the Irish Sea, the Pennines and much of the North West of England. On a clear day the summit offers a view of four national parks: the Lake District, Yorkshire Dales, Peak District and Snowdonia.\n\nThe bare hilltop was once covered by woodland that may have been destroyed by fire and it is thought that the hill was once inhabited, though no remains have been found. There is a Bronze Age round cairn dating from 1600–1400 BC on the hill.\n\nTwo burial mounds dating from the Bronze Age are located near the peak. On 24 March 1957, two men discovered \"curved lines of stones\" sticking out of the peat forming a two feet high wall which surrounded a raised area in the middle. In July 1958, a group from the University of Manchester excavated the central mound only to find it had been excavated 250 years earlier. The site was thought to have originated from 1500 BC in the Middle Bronze Age.\n\nThe second mound was found higher up the hill on the southern edge of Noon Hill. The site was excavated in August 1958 by the Bolton & District Archaeological Society, revealing two lines of stones and human remains.\n\nTwo memorial cairns on the hill are known as Wilder Lads or Two Lads. Thomas Hampson in 1883 described Two Lads as the graves of two children of a Saxon king, Edgar, and recorded that Winter Hill was previously known as Edgar Hill. The cairns could mark the site on which two boys lost their way on the moor and died of exposure in a snowstorm.\n\nOn 9 November 1838 George Henderson, a Scottish merchant walking over the hill from Horwich to Blackburn, was murdered by gunshot. A monument was erected in 1912 to replace an earlier bush planted at the spot, sited at the side of the road opposite the television station. Scotsman's Stump was celebrated in a poem entitled 'Scotchman's Stump' by Bolton poet John Cassidy. It was published in his collection Night Cries, published by Bloodaxe in 1982.\n\nAircraft crashes around Winter Hill include a two-seater aircraft in the 1920s. During World War II an American Fairchild UC-61 Forwarder (41-54885) of 5th Air Depot Group crashed on 7 August 1942. On 24 December 1943, an Airspeed Oxford (BM837) of 410 Squadron crashed on the hill. Other crashes have included several Spitfires, Hurricanes and a Gloster Meteor which crashed in 1953. \n\nOn 27 February 1958 occurred the Winter Hill air disaster, a Silver City Bristol 170 Freighter (G-AICS) travelling from the Isle of Man to Manchester crashed into Winter Hill several hundred yards away from the transmitter. There is a memorial plaque to the accident at the site.\n\nIn September 1965 a RAF De Havilland Chipmunk flew into the hill in cloud, without serious injury to the crew. The last crash occurred in October 1968 when a Cessna 172 force-landed between Winter Hill and Rivington Pike.\n\nIn 2018, a large wildfire broke out on the 28 June. It burned over of moorland, with one hundred firefighters sent to tackle the blaze. In total, the fire burned for 41 days, and caused a major incident to be declared. A man was later arrested for arson on suspicion of causing the wildfire. The fire, along with the Saddleworth Moor fire (which also burned over 7 square miles of land) has been described by local councillor Brenda Warrington as the \"worst series of moor fires in living memory\". It has affected local wildlife, killing both flora and fauna in an \"internationally important ecosystem\" as described by the Woodland Trust. The fire destroyed over a fifth of the moorland on the hill, and it may take a decade to recover fully. Concerns were raised in 2011 to Natural England regarding moorland management with warnings of increased fire risk due to policy of United Utilities to reduce grazing, whilst not using other land management measures including cutting or controlled burning to reduce fire risks.\n\nThe area is popular with walkers and footpaths and bridleways provide access to the hillside and surrounding moorland. Winter Hill was the site of a mass trespass in 1896 when 10,000 people marched from Bolton to the open countryside in a mass demonstration after the owner of the Smithills Hall estate, Colonel Richard Henry Ainsworth tried to stop public access, the demonstrators repeated the march the following week and were met with no opposition to them accessing the moors, it is considered an early forerunner of the Kinder Scout mass trespass. The demonstration is commemorated by a memorial stone on Coal Pit Lane, below Smithills Moor. \nThe hill and surrounding moorland area is open access land recorded by Bolton Council and has a right to roam.\n\nUFOs have been reported on Winter Hill. In 1950, a witness described a \"dark flat iron shaped object hovering close to the ground\" and an encounter with a being that returned to a craft before disappearing. In 1999, in what became known as the \"Murphy Incident\", a farmer said he saw an object hovering over his cattle field. On investigation, the object moved away and the farmer reported the incident to the police. The farmer returned to the field and discovered the object had reappeared. He reported the incident to the Manchester Aerial Phenomena Investigation Team (MAPIT), who investigated it. While MAPIT was conducting its investigation, they alleged they were being followed by a man in a vehicle. The farmer reported that he was warned by officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food but has not been traced since the incident, and the current owner has not spoken about it.\n\nThe UK government released previously classified information on UFO sightings in May 2006; one picture appeared to show an unidentified object over Winter Hill.\n\nThe song \"Winter Hill\" on A Certain Ratio's 1981 album \"To Each...\", consists of drumming, whistling and a low-pitched drone alternating between two notes a tone apart for its entire length. On a visit to Winter Hill in 1988, a piece of electronic equipment was found which made a high-pitched drone and alternated between two notes a tone apart.\n\nThe song \"Winter Hill\" on Doves' 2009 album \"Kingdom of Rust\", also references the site.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

As the Yellowstone river flows north from Yellowstone Lake, it leaves the Hayden Valley and plunges first over Upper Yellowstone Falls and then a quarter mile (400 m) downstream over Lower Yellowstone Falls, at which point it then enters the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, which is up to 1,000 feet (304 m) deep.\n\nThe upper falls () are 109 feet (33 m) high. The brink of the upper falls marks the junction between a hard rhyolite lava flow and weaker glassy lava that has been more heavily eroded.\n\nCascading from the 590,000 year old Canyon Rhyolite lava flow, Lower Yellowstone Falls is the largest volume waterfall in the Rocky Mountains of the United States. These falls () are high, or nearly twice as high as Niagara Falls. The volume of water flowing over Lower Yellowstone Falls can vary from in the autumn, to at peak runoff in late springtime. The flow rate of Lower Yellowstone Falls is much less than that of Niagara Falls, as the Yellowstone River is only at the point at which it goes over the lower falls, whereas the Niagara River is in width as it approaches the crest line of Horseshoe Falls.\n\nIt is likely that Native American tribes knew of the falls for centuries. Captain William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition made a note in his journal about hearing of the falls but did not believe the story. The first European to see the falls was likely French fur trapper Baptise Ducharme who claimed to see the falls in 1824, 1826 and 1839. Jim Bridger and fellow explorer James Gremmell claimed they visited the falls in 1846. In 1851, Bridger provided missionary Father Pierre-Jean De Smet a map showing the location of the falls. The Cook–Folsom–Peterson Expedition, a private group of three explorers named the falls in 1869. The earliest images of the falls were drawn by Private Charles Moore, a member of the U.S. Army escort of the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition which explored the Yellowstone River in August–September 1870. During the Hayden Expedition of 1871, the falls were documented in photographs by William Henry Jackson and later in paintings by Thomas Moran. In January 1887, Frank Jay Haynes took the first winter photographs of the lower falls.\n\nOver the years the estimates of the height of Lower Falls has varied dramatically. In 1851 Jim Bridger estimated its height at 250 feet. One outrageous newspaper story from 1867 placed its height at \"thousands of feet\". A map from 1869 gives the falls its current name of Lower Falls for the first time and estimates the height at 350 feet.\nHowever the current map lists the Lower Falls at a height of 308 feet.\n\nToday, there are numerous vantage points for viewing the falls. The Canyon loop road skirts the west side of the canyon with several vehicle parking areas. One trail leads down to the brink of the lower falls, a steep third of a mile (600 m). Uncle Tom's Trail descends from the east down a series of stairs attached to the cliffs.\n\nThe Lower Falls area is located just to the south and east of Canyon Village in Yellowstone National Park. A one-way loop drive starting south from Canyon Junction takes one to the brink of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and offers four viewpoints, with the first stop at the trail that leads to the top of the Lower Falls. The one-way drive continues east and north past the other viewpoints, rejoining the main Grand Loop road from the east at Canyon Junction once more.\n\n\n\n"}

It has run other bases in the past, such as Vanda Station.\n\nNew Zealand's involvement in Antarctica began in 1923, when activities were closely connected with the United Kingdom. Close cooperation with other nations has been an important part of New Zealand's involvement in Antarctica. \n\nSince 1959 Scott Base has been New Zealand's permanent base in Antarctica. From 1965 to 1988 the person responsible for much of Scott Base development as head of the Antarctic Division of the DSIR was Bob Thomson\n\nA 1994 review recognised Antarctica as strategically important to New Zealand as a Southern Hemisphere nation. This resulted in the establishment of the New Zealand Antarctic Institute, known as Antarctica New Zealand, on 1 July 1996.\n\nThe Institute reports to the Ministry Of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) Antarctic Policy Unit. It is a Crown entity, and has a CEO and a Board. Members of the Board are appointed for three years by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade in consultation with the Board Chair. This period may be extended by the Minister for up to a further three years.\n\nMembers are collectively accountable to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the performance of Antarctica New Zealand. All delegated functions and powers within Antarctica New Zealand arise from the Board's delegations.\n\nThe Board’s role is governance. Specific functions within this overall role include setting the strategic direction of Antarctica New Zealand and developing policy in a manner consistent with the organisation’s statutory framework, for example through the Annual Business Plan, ensuring compliance with the law, accountability documents and relevant Crown expectations. This includes financial responsibility for all money received by the Crown and reinforcing expectations of behaviour that are appropriate to a public body, appointing the Chief Executive, monitoring the performance of Antarctica New Zealand and the Chief Executive, and maintaining appropriate relationships with the Minister, Parliament and the public.

He currently runs BJJ schools across the United States, Australia, Canada and Mexico.\n\nCarlos started martial arts at the age of four. His main instructor throughout his life was his cousin Carlos Gracie, Jr. but he has also trained with Helio Gracie, Carlson Gracie, Rolls Gracie, Rickson Gracie, Crolin Gracie, Rillion Gracie and his brothers. While in Brazil, he has successfully competed and was champion for 10 years straight in competition at the State and National level which at the time was equivalent to the Worlds as BJJ had not spread to the masses yet. He competed and won against many of today's top founders of BJJ teams! He believes BJJ is the greatest addition to modern martial arts. \nCarlos also lived with his Uncle Carlos Gracie, founder of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Carlos greatest mentor, for 5 years while attending and eventually graduating from Law School.\n\nCarlos was teaching in America as early as 1990. In April 1994 he moved to Los Angeles, California. There he met martial arts movie star Chuck Norris, who was instrumental in promoting Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and the Machado family. Since then, Mr. Norris has been one of the greatest advocates of Machado Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Carlos lived in Los Angeles until the end of 1995, when he moved to the city of Dallas, Texas. There he taught Brazilian jiu-jitsu out of the same building in which Chuck Norris's television show \"Walker, Texas Ranger\" was filmed. That allowed Machado not only to teach at his studio, but also to take part in many episodes of that popular show. He often assisted on choreographing fight scenes with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.\n\nBesides running his school, Machado has been involved in competition, winning the Pan American of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (97/98), he also won several super fights in the U.S. (U.S Open 98/99), he competed in ADCC with a broken foot and still placed and earned the award of fastest submission in 1998, and the World Master's Championships (2000) in two weight divisions (middle weight and open class). After an impressive 34 year stellar competition career he retired from the competition arena winning the Worlds!\n\nHe currently holds the highest rank of this style in the Southwest (Eighth Degree Black Belt).

Mount Lyell was the dominant copper mining company of the West Coast from 1893 to 1994, and was based in Queenstown, Tasmania.\n\nFollowing consolidation of leases and company assets at the beginning of the twentieth century, Mount Lyell was the major company for the communities of Queenstown, Strahan and Gormanston. It remained dominant until its closure in 1994.\n\nThe Mount Lyell mining operations produced more than a million tonnes of copper, 750 tonnes of silver and 45 tonnes of gold since mining commenced in the early 1890s - which is equivalent to over 4 billion dollars worth of metal in 1995 terms.\n\nIn the early stage of operations, Mount Lyell was surrounded by smaller competing leases and companies. Eventually they were all absorbed into Mount Lyell operations, or were closed down. In 1903 the North Mount Lyell company was taken over, and in 1912 the most severe calamity to visit the Mount Lyell company was the 1912 North Mount Lyell Disaster, also known at the time as the North Lyell fire.\n\nDuring its history, Mount Lyell had exploration leases surrounding its main mining area, and had at one time or other explored most of the West Coast Range revisiting many of the smaller mines that had been worked on in the early 1900s. As a consequence the Mount Lyell company had utilised considerable resources on maintaining leases over areas of promising geology - as well as checking older mining locations on the west coast. At various stages it also shared costs and resources with other companies which would assist by investing in exploration by becoming partners in some leases.\n\nThe operations were conducted in various parts of the Mount Lyell Lease, and in the mid 1970s, prior to reduction in the workforce, \"Cape Horn\" was located just west of the \"Comstock\" operation which was on the north side of Mount Lyell, while most of the North Mount Lyell workings were finished, \"12 West\" was still in operation due to its rich copper ores. \"West Lyell open cut\" which had been dominant in the 1950s was finished, and various parts of the lease were disappearing into the opening above the \"Prince Lyell\" workings.\n\nFollowing the first large layoffs in the mid 1970s, the town of Queenstown lost its dominance on the west coast by the mid 1990s, and being mainly a company town many services closed by the 2000s, and the separate west Tasmanian local government authorities were amalgamated into the West Coast Council.\n\nOn 29 March 1993 the company celebrated its centenary. At that stage it was known as the Copper Division of Renison Goldfields Consolidated Limited.\nThe Mount Lyell Mining Field, and the various activities of the company in Queenstown and the west coast of Tasmania were celebrated throughout the community.\n\nThe Mount Lyell Remediation and Research and Demonstration Program was conducted between 1994 and 1996 following the closing of the company, to reverse the ecological change upon the Queen and King Rivers, and Macquarie Harbour; caused by the release of mine waste and effluent into the rivers. It is estimated that 100 million tonnes of tailings were disposed of into the Queen River.\n\nThe Mount Lyell lease and mine was reopened by Copper Mines of Tasmania in 1995. This company in turn was acquired by Sterlite Industries, an Indian-based company, in 1999. As a consequence it is part of the Vedanta group of companies. Its concentrate material is shipped to India for processing. Government guidelines saw tailings dams created and special measures taken to prevent any further pollution of the rivers and harbour.\n\nMining was suspended at Mount Lyell due to accidents in the 2010s, and remains in mothball situation in the late 2010s. \n\nThe following locations were within the operating mine lease and indicate a separate orebody - the operating life is also indicated: -\n\nMount Lyell was also the operator of the gauge Queenstown to Regatta Point railway from 1893 to 1963, which used the Abt rack system of cog railway for steep sections. This railway was rebuilt and recommenced operation in 2002 as the Abt Wilderness Railway, and is now known as the \"West Coast Wilderness Railway\" and was operated by Federal Hotels until 2013.\n\nThe company has been significant in Australian business history works as Geoffrey Blainey, the Australian historian, began his career with the writing of the company history The Peaks of Lyell, which has now progressed to its sixth edition.\n\nAlso, due to circumstances at the winding up of Mount Lyell significant amounts of company records were deposited with Tasmanian state archives.\n\nPollution of the Queen and King Rivers, and Macquarie Harbour was caused by the release of mine waste and effluent into the rivers. It is estimated that 100 million tonnes of tailings were disposed of into the Queen River.\n\nThe environmental impacts included:\nSmelting ended in the 1960s and CMT has built a dam to contain tailings.\n\nResearch by the Supervising Scientist published in 1997 overwhelmingly identified the lease site as the major source of acid drainage-related pollutants affecting the rivers and harbour, with metals contamination from tailing and slag deposits being very minor in comparison.\n\nWithin the lease site, the North Lyell Tunnel has water derived in part from underground workings and has approximately 78% of the lease site copper loading. Discharge from other tunnels and waste rock dumps accounts for 21%. The remaining 1% is from smaller sources.\n\nDownstream, chemical modelling and toxicological testing indicates that 95% to 99% of the acid drainage from the site must be neutralised or stemmed for the resultant water quality to meet downstream environmental quality objectives. Contaminated sediments in the King River and Macquarie Harbour contribute relatively little of the total pollutant load entering the harbour.\n\n\n"}

The college must elect as administrator a priest or bishop at least 35 years old. If the college of consultors fails to elect a priest of the required minimum age within the time allotted, the choice of diocesan administrator passes to the metropolitan archbishop or, if the metropolitan see is vacant, to the senior by appointment of the suffragan bishops of the ecclesiastical province.\n\nIf a diocese has a coadjutor bishop, the coadjutor succeeds immediately to the episcopal see upon the previous bishop's death or resignation, and there is no vacancy of the see. The see also does not become vacant if the Pope appoints an apostolic administrator.\n\nBefore the election of the diocesan administrator of a vacant see, the governance of the see is entrusted, with the powers of a vicar general, to the auxiliary bishop, if there is one, or to the senior among them, if there are several, otherwise to the college of consultors as a whole. The diocesan administrator has greater powers, essentially those of a bishop except for matters excepted by the nature of the matter or expressly by law. Canon law subjects his activity to various legal restrictions and to special supervision by the college of consultors (as for example canons 272 and 485). The diocesan administrator remains in charge until a new bishop takes possession of the see or until he presents his resignation to the college of consultors.\n\nSome Bishops ruled more than one bishopric for long. In any beside their primary bishopric, they would have to be called an \"administrator\". Nevertheless, in local tradition often they are called bishops in all their bishoprics.\n\nAn episcopal conference can transfer the functions of the consultors to the cathedral chapter. In those countries in which the episcopal conference has transferred the functions, the cathedral chapter, and not the consultors, elect the diocesan administrator. Capitular election was the default rule before the adoption of the 1983 Code of Canon Law; this old default rule is reflected in the term for the equivalent of a diocesan administrator in the 1917 code: vicar capitular.\n\nSince the Investiture Controversy in 11th and 12th centuries the cathedral chapters used to elect the Catholic bishops in the Holy Roman Empire. Prince-bishoprics were elective monarchies of imperial immediacy within the Empire, with the monarch being the respective bishop usually elected by the chapter and confirmed by the Holy See, or exceptionally only appointed by the Holy See. Papally confirmed bishops were then invested by the emperor with the princely regalia, thus the title prince-bishop. However, sometimes the respective incumbent of the see never gained a papal confirmation, but was still invested with the princely power. Also the opposite occurred with a papally confirmed bishop, never invested as prince.\n\nCandidates elected, who lacked canon-law prerequisites and/or papal confirmation, would officially only hold the title diocesan administrator (but nevertheless colloquially be referred to as prince-bishop). This was the case with Catholic candidates, who were elected for an episcopal see with its revenues as a mere appanage and with all Protestant candidates, who all lacked either the necessary vocational training or the papal confirmation.\n\nWith many capitulars converting to Lutheranism or Calvinism during the Reformation, the majorities in many chapters consisted of Protestant capitulars. So they then also elected Protestants as bishops, who usually were denied papal confirmation. However, in the early years of Reformation, with the schism not yet fully implemented, it was not always obvious, who tended to Protestantism, so that some candidates only turned out to be Protestants after they had been papally confirmed as bishop and imperially invested as prince. Later, when Protestants were usually denied papal confirmation, the emperors nevertheless invested the unconfirmed candidates as princes - by a so-called liege indult () - due to political coalitions and conflicts within the empire, in order to gain candidates as imperial partisans.\n\nMany Protestant candidates, elected by the capitulars, neither achieved papal confirmation nor a liege indult, but nevertheless, as a matter of fact held de facto princely power. This was because the emperor would have to use force to bar the candidates from ruling, with the emperors lacking the respective power or pursuing other goals. A similar situation was in a number of imperially immediate abbeys with their prince-abbots and princess-abbesses. \nUnconfirmed incumbents of the sees were called \"Elected Bishops\" or \"Elected Archbishops\". The information that Protestant clerical rulers would generally have been called administrators, as written in several encyclopedies, does not fit historically documented practice. In their dioceses as well as in their territories, they had almost the same power as Catholic prince-bishops. However, one common restriction was that administered prince-bishoprics were denied to emit their deputies to the diets of the Empire or of the imperial circles (, respectively). This restriction was abandoned by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, when the emperor accepted Protestant administrators as fully empowered rulers. However, the Peace also secularised many of the prior Protestant prince-bishoprics and transformed them into hereditary monarchies.\n\nPrince-bishoprics, which were ruled by Protestants, were the following:\n\n\n"}

It is one of the first Chan Buddhist temples in the United States, and one of the largest Buddhist communities in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe city is situated in Talmage, California, a rural community in southeastern Mendocino County about east of Ukiah and north of San Francisco. It was one of the first Buddhist monasteries built in the United States. The temple follows the Guiyang school of Chan Buddhism, one of the Five Houses of Chan. The city is noted for its close adherence to the \"vinaya\", the austere, traditional Buddhist monastic code.\n\nThe Dharma Realm Buddhist Association purchased the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas site in 1974 and established an international center there by 1976. In 1979, the Third Threefold Ordination Ceremony at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas was held, in which monks from China, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and the US transmitted the precepts. It was considered unique, as it represented both the Mahayana and Theravada traditions.\n\nOriginally the site housed the Mendocino State Asylum for the Insane (later renamed the Mendocino State Hospital), founded in 1889. There were over seventy large buildings, over two thousand rooms of various sizes, three gymnasiums, a fire station, a swimming pool, a refuse incinerator, fire hydrants, and various other facilities. A paved road wound its way through the complex, lined with tall street lamps and trees planted during the asylum's initial construction. The connections for electricity and pipes for water, heating, and air conditioning were all underground, but centrally controlled.\n\nConsidering the natural surroundings to be ideal for cultivation, Hsuan Hua visited the valley three times and negotiated with the seller many times. He wanted to establish a center for propagating the Buddhadharma throughout the world and for introducing the Buddhist teachings, which originated in the East, to the Western world. Hsuan Hua planned to create a major center for world Buddhism, and an international orthodox monastery for the purpose of elevating moral standards and raising people's awareness.\n\nThe city comprises of land, of which are developed. The rest of the land includes meadows, orchards, and forests. Large institutional buildings and smaller residential houses are scattered over the west side of the campus. The main Buddha hall, monastic facilities, educational institutes, administrative offices, the main kitchen and dining hall, Jyun Kang Vegetarian Restaurant, and supporting structures are all located in this complex.\n\nIn 2009, the walls of the Long Life Hall suffered structural damage caused by an electrical fire. However, no major damage occurred to the altar, artwork or statues inside the hall.\n\n\nTwo practices distinguish the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas from many other Chinese Buddhist monasteries: the monastics always wear the long sashes that are worn outside the \"kāṣāya\" or monastic clothing, and they eat only one meal a day, always before noon.\n\nAt night most of them sit up and rest, rather than lying down to sleep. Monastics at the city do not have any social lives, nor do men and women intermingle. Whereas many ordinary Chinese monks go out to perform rituals for events such as weddings or funerals, none of these monks do so. Some monastics even choose to maintain a vow of silence, for varying periods of time. They wear a tag saying \"No Talking\" and do not speak with anyone.\n\nThere are monks and nuns who maintain the precept of not owning personal wealth and not touching money, thus eliminating the thought of money and increasing their purity of mind. Master Hsuan Hua often reminded his disciples: \n\nThe City of Ten Thousand Buddhas is a strict Buddhist monastery adhering to the traditional Asian monastic culture although it is located in a liberal area of California. While the traditionalists are more drawn to the spiritual and devotional side of Buddhism, Westerners are often more interested in meditation. Some of the boarding school children are Westerners from the local community who want their children to grow up in a community-oriented place, while some of the children come from Taiwan and China, and even from European countries, such as France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, where parents think highly of Hsuan Hua.\n\nThe monastery houses both male and female , students from the boarding school, and is open to the public. However, males and females have separate campuses, with gender-neutral buildings in the middle of the campus. In contrast, many monasteries in China, Taiwan, and the West house only monks or only nuns (but not both), and are closed to the public.\n\nHsuan Hua set up the six principles for all monastics and lay practitioners to follow as guidelines for spiritual development. These principles were \"not to fight nor be greedy, not to seek nor be selfish, not to pursue personal advantage, and not to lie.\"\n\nSince spiritual development is a full-time endeavor, certain rules and customs are followed in the community, including:\n\nOther notable customs:\n\nMany animals roam the grounds of the City, including peafowl, deer, squirrels, and other species. The peacocks are generally quite accustomed to the presence of people and are tame. The peacocks pose a large problem on the farm, so countermeasures have been taken against them, including covering the plants, moving the peacocks to a walnut farm, and planting extra food based on the assumption that a significant fraction will be eaten or damaged by peacocks.\nDuring special Dharma Assemblies, a Liberating of Life ceremony is held, in which many animals – especially pheasants and chukar partridges – bought from hunting preserves, are set free.\n\nHsi Lai Temple, associated with Fo Guang Shan and located in Hacienda Heights in Southern California, has claimed since 1988 that they are the largest Buddhist temple in the Western Hemisphere.

He is also known for his exceptionally wide vocal range, with his modal voice spanning over 4 octaves. In 2015 he was briefly the frontman for heavy metal band Skid Row.\n\nHarnell was born in San Diego in 1962. He has an older half sister by his father. His mother, Constance Haldaman, was an opera singer while his father, Boyd Harnell, was a photojournalist. As a teenager, Harnell was a professional skateboarder and avid surfer.\n\nHarnell started singing at the age of 5. At 17 he joined his first band and spent the next three years in approximately fifteen bands including Bronx-based Jackals, a band of cultivated talent emerging from the guitarist's home basement that in a scant two years, gained enough popularity in the NYC area to fill rock clubs to capacity simply by word of mouth alone. This was the band in which Harnell was discovered. At 18, Harnell started studying with vocal teacher Don Lawrence.\n\nAfter a show in 1984, Harnell was introduced to record producer Mike Varney who mentioned a band in Norway, TNT, that was looking for a singer. Harnell was hired shortly after the band heard a demo tape of his vocals.\n\nHarnell and guitarist Ronni Le Tekrø co-wrote all of TNT's material together during Harnell's 22-year run with the band. With Harnell, TNT recorded nine studio albums, two live videos and two \"best of\" compilations. \n\nHe left the band in April 2006 for personal and professional reasons. He performed his last show with the band on June 30, 2006 and a DVD was released that autumn that features the penultimate show in Madrid, Spain on April 1.\n\nOn October 17, 2013, Harnell announced that he had rejoined TNT.\n\nAfter a year and a half absence, during which time, he fronted Skid Row, Harnell announced another return to TNT in May 2016.\n\nHarnell would leave the band once again in October 2017 and was replaced by previous unknown Baol Bardot Bulsara.\n\nMorning Wood is an acoustic rock supergroup composed of Harnell, Al Pitrelli, Chuck Bonfonte, and Danny Mirada.\n\nThe act's album was first released in Japan in 1994 during TNT's first break-up and in 2002 was re-released in Europe credited to \"Tony Harnell and Morning Wood.\"\n\nWestworld is a side project of Harnell's that also featured Mark Reale, Bruno Ravel, and John O'Reilly, with keyboardist Josh Pincus and violinist Mark Wood. Westworld has released three studio albums and a live album.\n\n\"Starbreaker\" is another band featuring Harnell and Magnus Karlsson. Some former members include John Macaluso, and Fabrizio Grossi. It released its first album in 2005. A second Starbreaker album, \"Love's Dying Wish\", was released in 2008. The band never toured. A third Starbreaker album, \"Dysphoria\", featuring Harnell and Karlsson among others, is scheduled for release in January 2019.\n\nHarnell has done tracks for the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" video game series. His first track for the series was \"It Doesn't Matter\" on the soundtrack of \"Sonic Adventure\" released in 1998 by SEGA. Harnell returned in 2001 to perform a rewritten version of the theme for Sonic in \"Sonic Adventure 2\", as well as the first stage theme \"Escape from the City\" with Ted Poley. Following this in 2004, Harnell performed the Team Sonic theme for \"Sonic Heroes\" called \"We Can\", again with Poley and in 2011 he returned for \"Sonic Generations\" to perform two new remixes of \"Escape from the City\" with Poley.\n\nIn 2008, Harnell released his first solo material in demo form, the EP \"Cinematic\", through his website. It was followed in 2010 by the \"Round Trip\" album under the name Tony Harnell & The Mercury Train, a collection of re-recordings of classic Harnell songs from his previous bands TNT and Westworld in a stripped-down acoustic format. Harnell released the digital single \"Take What You're Giving\" in 2011 before teaming up with guitarist Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal and others for the \"Tony Harnell & the Wildflowers featuring Bumblefoot\" album in 2013.\n\nOn April 6, 2015, it was announced that Johnny Solinger had left the American heavy metal band Skid Row. Hours later, the band announced that Harnell would be Solinger's replacement. On December 29, he announced that he had left Skid Row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Greek rebel forces were being besieged inside the Acropolis of Athens by Ottoman forces under the command of Mehmed Reshid Pasha. Greek forces outside the city were desperately trying to break the siege.\n\nThe Scottish Admiral Lord Cochrane and Irish General Richard Church were nominally commanding the Greeks. 3,000 men were ordered to advance across the plain. Their plan was to send 7,000 more men who were at Piraeus to attack the Ottomans from the flanks. Karaiskakis had proposed instead of a direct attack, to cut the supply lines of the Ottomans in eastern Greece, but his proposal was declined.\n\nAs the Greeks advanced from Phaleron, Reshid sent some cavalry to attack the Greeks. He expected the main assault to come from Piraeus. The troops from Piraeus did not arrive and the rest of the Greeks were attacked by the Ottoman cavalry.\n\nThe Greeks lost either 1,500 or 2,000 men, which was a devastating setback. The men in the Acropolis surrendered on 5 June and were escorted by the French army to the coast. This defeat destroyed Greek morale and the only places on mainland Greece that persevered after the battle were Mani and Nafplio, seat of the government.\n\nThe Greeks had also lost their commander Karaiskakis from wounds suffered a few days before the battle.\n\nLater that year, the Great Powers, Imperial Russia, the restored kingdom of France, and Great Britain destroyed the Egyptian and Ottoman fleets in the Battle of Navarino.\n\n"}

It is an offshoot of the \"Resident Evil\" light gun shooter games, but based on the story of the \"Dino Crisis\" series. Though it can be played by other means, a light gun is recommended, as the game is one in a number of Capcom games that try to bridge the gap between light gun games and traditional games that allow the player greater range of control over their movements in the game.\n\n\"Dino Stalker\" is the third entry in the Capcom's \"Gun Survivor\" series after \"\". Although the \"Gun Survivor\" games are an offshoot of the \"Resident Evil\" series, \"Dino Stalker\" is the only game in the series without any ties to \"Resident Evil\" (with the exception of two easter eggs in Stage 5, one involving the \"woman drawing water\" statue from the mansion in the first game, and an Umbrella building). It was followed by \"\".\n\n\"Dino Stalker\" is a first-person shooter in which the player must use various weapons to defend against dinosaurs while progressing through the game. \"Dino Stalker\" supports the optional use of the GunCon light gun accessory. The player can use a variety of weapons throughout the game, including bazookas, machine guns, and shotguns, but can only carry one weapon at a time. The game takes place across various landscapes, including desert and jungle. A two-player mode is unlocked upon completion of the game.\n\nThe game's storyline focuses on Mike Wired, a World War II pilot. After being shot down during combat over the Atlantic, Mike is transported into the dinosaur-populated future from \"Dino Crisis 2\".\n\nMike Wired, a World War II era fighter pilot is about to die in the sky in 1943, as bullets approach him before he can parachute to safety. Mike mysteriously somehow ends up being transported to a time with flying dinosaurs, which he manages to kill. He meets Paula, a survivor from \"Dino Crisis 2\" who speaks some English but is not able to speak long sentences. Traversing through the various stages under the guidance of Paula's father, Dylan, Mike defeats many different groups of savage dinosaurs using a special gun he gained, finally battling and defeating their intelligent leader, Trinity, which controlled the other dinosaurs. But despite falling in love with Paula, Mike must go back to just before his imminent death. Paula then edits the timescale to make the bullets vanish to prevent Mike from dying, and he is rescued by men on a boat, realizing that Paula was the one who saved him.\n\n\"Dino Stalker\" received \"mixed\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. On release, \"Famitsu\" gave the game a score of 30 out of 40 in Japan.\n\nDouglass C. Perry of IGN criticized the game's controls: \"After the first mission, your hand is in pain. The Carpel Tunnel syndrome you didn't have before throbs in fiery extended agony as if to say hello, and you have just started. [...] In the dozen-plus levels you play through, the slow-paced, awkward control is not only annoying but it hurts you. [...] But at least there is some comic relief, and for the pure sake of flat-out lunacy, this game may be worth your while.\" Perry also criticized the game's poor graphics, writing that it \"looks like it was designed as a PlayStation game and that it only recently made the transition to PlayStation 2. [...] It's an average looking game at best, and that's putting it nicely.\"\n\nRyan Davis of GameSpot called the game's premise \"bizarre and convoluted\" with \"not a lot of coherence.\" Davis criticized the game's selectable control schemes. Playing exclusively with the GunCon 2, Davis wrote that \"using a single hand to move and shoot is difficult and will wear out your arm more quickly than your average light-gun game.\" Davis also criticized the alternative method of using a standard DualShock controller: \"the targeting reticle is far too sensitive, and you'll often find yourself dealing with bouts of overcorrection while trying to draw a bead on a dino.\" Davis noted that the best option was to utilize both the DualShock and the GunCon 2 simultaneously, \"But even this configuration does not compensate completely for the game's inherently slow movement or the inability to look up or down, and you'll spend an equal amount of time-fighting the controls as you will fighting dinosaurs.\" Davis also criticized the game's poor graphics, and wrote that the only notable sound effect throughout the game \"is the 'reload' command you'll hear whenever you're out of bullets, and this is only because the computer voice noticeably mispronounces it.\" Davis concluded that the game would have been \"infinitely more playable had Capcom discarded the Gun Survivor control scheme and just left the movement control on rails, like all other light-gun games. But with its needlessly frustrating control scheme intact, Dino Stalker's appeal is incredibly limited. Though the game is loosely affiliated with the Dino Crisis games, there's not a lot here to draw fans of that series, and with several superior light-gun games available on the PlayStation 2, there's little reason for anyone without a masochistic streak to play this game.\"\n\nLouis Bedigian of GameZone praised the music and graphics and wrote that the control scheme \"isn't bad, but it does take some getting used to. It's worth getting used to though, because this is the best dino-hunting game I've played since Dino Crisis 2.\" Tom Bramwell of \"Eurogamer\" called it \"easily the best yet\" in the \"Gun Survivor\" series, and praised the game for \"some stunning environments,\" but criticized its short length and some of the \"rather bland\" dinosaur designs.\n\n"}

Administratively, it is part of the Sha Tin District. It is one of Hong Kong's most prominent examples of new town developments in the 1970s. Together with its satellite town Ma On Shan, Shatin is the most populous city in the New Territories, with a 2011 population census of 630,273 within an area of . Situated in the southern half of New Territories East below Tolo Harbour, it is the principal city of Sha Tin District, which is the second most populous district of the territory.\n\nThe city was founded in 1973 under the New Towns Development Programme of the Hong Kong government. Its current name was named after the nearby village of Sha Tin Wai. Housing the industrial area of Fo Tan, Shatin's economy once heavily relied on manufacturing, logistics and transportation. Since the late 1990s, it has undergone an extensive transition into areas such as business, service, tourism, entertainment, culture, education, sports, technology and scientific research. This has been marked by the building of Sha Tin Racecourse, Hong Kong Sports Institute and the Hong Kong Science Park in its outskirts.\nTai Wai Village, located in Tai Wai, next to Sha Tin, and the oldest and largest walled village in Sha Tin District, was built in 1574, during the Ming Dynasty.\n\nBefore British rule in Hong Kong, the area of Sha Tin and its vicinity was referred to as Lek Yuen (lit. \"source of trickling\" or \"source of clear water\"). Colonial officials allegedly mistook the name of the Sha Tin Wai village as the name of the area and it has been used ever since. Nowadays, the original name is used to refer to Lek Yuen Estate.\n\nSha Tin was formerly a market town at the present location of Sha Tin Centre Street and New Town Plaza shopping centre, near the Sha Tin Station of the MTR East Rail Line.\n\nSha Tin was the location of the first flight of a powered aircraft in Hong Kong in 1911. The aeroplane was named as the \"Spirit of Sha Tin\" (). A full size replica of this plane now hangs in Hong Kong International Airport.\n\nThe area was formerly agricultural farmland. Before Sha Tin's development into a new town, Hung Mui Kuk (), southwest of Sha Tin, was perennially the main site for school picnics. The hillside area remains a popular barbecue site.\n\nStarting in the 1970s, the area became part of the Sha Tin New Town development. Since then, the economy in the area has greatly improved and living standards have also increased. Sha Tin Town Centre was developed during the mid-1980s to help \"link the town's currently dispersed residents into one cohesive community.\" The 18-hectare site, adjacent to the railway station, was built up in stages to house an array of uses including the New Town Plaza, numerous smaller shopping centres, Sha Tin Park, magistracy, library, town hall, marriage registry, hotel, New Town Tower, a town square, and residential towers.\n\nSha Tin is located in a valley, on both sides of the Shing Mun River, running from the southwest to the northeast. It is bordered by Tai Wai in the southwest and by Fo Tan (left bank) and Shek Mun (right bank) in the northeast.\n\nDue to their proximity to the Shenzhen border, towns in the northern parts of Hong Kong, notably Sheung Shui and Yuen Long, have become hubs for parallel traders who have been buying up large quantities of goods, forcing up local prices and disrupting the daily lives of local citizens. Since 2012, there has been an increase in mainland parallel traders arriving in the North District of Hong Kong to re-export infant formula and household products – goods popular with mainlanders – across the border to Shenzhen. The volume of smuggling activity spilled over into Tuen Mun and Sha Tin in 2014.\n\nThe first anti-parallel trading protest was started at Sheung Shui in September 2012. As government efforts to limit the adverse impact of mainland trafficking were widely seen as inadequate, so there have been further subsequent protests in towns in the North District including Sha Tin.\n\nPrivate housing estates in Sha Tin include:\n\nSouth bank of Shing Mun River. From west to east:\nNorth bank of Shing Mun River. From west to east:\n\n\n\nThe Prince of Wales Hospital was officially opened in 1982. It provides about 1,400 hospital beds and 24 hours Accident & Emergency service to the eastern New Territories. Other institutions which provide hospital services include the Sha Tin Hospital, the Cheshire Home and the Union Hospital.\n\n\nAt present, there are 46 primary and 44 secondary schools in Sha Tin and Ma On Shan. Tertiary institutions include Hong Kong Baptist University (Shek Mun Campus), the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education - Sha Tin (IVE-ST) and the Hong Kong Sports Institute.\n\n\nThere are numerous cultural, recreational and sport facilities in Sha Tin including the Town Hall, swimming pools, football pitches, indoor recreation centres and various track and field facilities for the use of Sha Tin residents.\n\nThe 8-hectare Sha Tin Park was opened to public in 1988. Apart from its horticultural gardens and impressive water features, it also includes a large open plaza and a bandstand. The Ma On Shan Park, which is adjacent to Ma On Shan Swimming Pool, occupies 5.5 hectare of land.\n\nThe Sha Tin Racecourse, occupying approximately 70 hectares, rests on reclaimed flatland. At the centre of the racecourse is the Penfold Garden which opens to the public on non-racing days.\nLocated in Tai Wai, the Hong Kong Heritage Museum was opened at the end of 2000. Apart from introducing the art, culture and history of the New Territories, the museum also exhibits a variety of cultural artifacts for public appreciation. The museum, which can accommodate 6,000 visitors, is the largest in the territory.\nCycling has been a distinctive feature in Sha Tin and is very popular among both local people and visitors. The first cycle track in Sha Tin was opened to public in 1981, running along Tolo Highway to Tai Po, and this remains the territory's most popular cycling venue, drawing many occasional riders at the weekends, as well as dedicated cyclists. To tie in with the development of Ma On Shan, the cycle track was extended to Ma On Shan.\n\nHiking is also a wonderful activity you could do in your leisure time living in Sha Tin. There are several starting points including Hin Tin Village, Sha Tin Tau Village and hung mui kuk barbecue area leading to the track of Lion Rock Mountain hiking route. It would take you 1 hour to 4 hours to complete the track depends on the starting point and ending point you choose.\n\nSha Tin is famous for certain local variants of Cantonese food such as\" ShanSui Tofu\" (), barbecued pigeon and chicken congee. The cooked food stalls in Wo Che Estate and Fo Tan are hotspots for food.\n\nThere are numerous transportation links both within the Sha Tin District and connecting it to other places in Hong Kong.\n\nThe road network in Sha Tin is well developed to provide efficient cross-town and local access traffic. Connection between Sha Tin and Kowloon mainly relies on the Lion Rock Tunnel, Tate's Cairn Tunnel, Shing Mun Tunnel and Tai Po Road which makes it easy to reach from many areas of Kowloon as well as from Tsuen Wan.\n\nAt present, there are over 110 routes of public bus serving Sha Tin.\n\n\nWhile having been mass developed in the 1970s, Shatin's architecture maintains a degree of diversity. Most public housing estates developed in the era followed the UK's Brutalist architecture. Several shopping centres, hotels and government buildings around Shatin Central are cladded in red brick and resemble styles of American Modernism. \n\n"}

It was established in its current form by the \"Police Force (Jersey) Law, 1974\" and consists of around 240 officers.\n\nThis was some 130 years after the need for a full-time force was identified. A body of paid and uniformed town police was set up in Saint Helier in 1854, which became the nucleus of the Paid Police established to operate Island-wide in 1951 by the \"Paid Police Force (Jersey) Law\". The Paid Police was renamed the States of Jersey Police in 1960.\n\nThe States Police supports the system of elected Honorary Police in each parish that has been in place in the Island since 1204.\n\nThe States of Jersey Police are the only officers with Island-wide powers and provide a professional response to all serious crime in the Island. Under a memorandum of understanding with the twelve parish forces the latter routinely handle minor matters and traffic control, but Centeniers remain the only officers able to bring charges.\n\nThe fictional \"Bureau des Étrangers\" department of the States of Jersey Police featured in the British TV series \"Bergerac\".\n\nAn investigation into allegations of historical child abuse had begun in 2006. Several sites in the grounds of Haut de la Garenne, a former children's home, were excavated in 2008 and finds of human remains and other items were announced amid sensational international publicity. In September 2008, Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell of Lancashire Police took over as Senior Investigating Officer in the abuse enquiry. In August 2008 David Warcup, Deputy Chief Constable of Northumbria Police, took over as Deputy Chief Officer of the States of Jersey Police. The new team launched a review of the investigation to date and subsequently in November 2008, the Deputy Chief Officer, David Warcup, expressed \"much regret\" that misleading information had been released throughout the conduct of the enquiry and that there was \"no evidence\" of any child murders at Haut de la Garenne.\n\nDetective Superintendent Gradwell retired in August 2009 at the end of his contract and returned to the UK. On retiring, he described the investigation prior to the time he took over as a \"poorly managed mess\" and, in particular, the decision to excavate at Haut de la Garenne as being without justification and as \"a complete and total waste of public money, time and effort\".\n\nAs a result of the wider investigation, disregarding the controversial excavations at Haut de la Garenne, charges were brought against three individuals, and convictions obtained in court in 2009.\n\nThe former Chief Officer of the States of Jersey Police, Graham Power, was suspended in November 2008 pending an inquiry into his handling of the historic abuse inquiry, in the wake of the public withdrawal by police of claims of evidence.\n\nIn August 2009, it was announced that Graham Power, still on suspension but contesting his suspension through legal process, had been suspended again in relation to the keeping of secret files on politicians, an affair unrelated to the historic abuse inquiry.\n\nGraham Power later retired and was replaced in the interim by David Warcup, who subsequently announced his own departure in July 2010.\n\nIn 2013, plans to build a new headquarters building were approved. The new building which supersedes the old headquarters located in Rouge Bouillon, was opened on 7 March 2017, and sits on land which was occupied by a part of Green Street car park.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2185562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2185562", "title": "Human branding", "text": "Human branding\n\nHuman branding or stigmatizing is the process by which a mark, usually a symbol or ornamental pattern, is burned into the skin of a living person, with the intention that the resulting scar makes it permanent. This is performed using a hot or very cold branding iron. It therefore uses the physical techniques of livestock branding on a human, either with consent as a form of body modification; or under coercion, as a punishment or to identify an enslaved or otherwise oppressed person. It may also be practiced as a \"rite of passage\", e.g. within a tribe, or to signify membership of or acceptance into an organization.\n\nThe English verb to \"burn\", attested since the 12th century, is a combination of Old Norse \"brenna\" \"to burn, light\", and two originally distinct Old English verbs: \"bærnan\" \"to kindle\" (transitive) and \"beornan\" \"to be on fire\" (intransitive), both from the Proto-Germanic root \"bren(wanan)\", perhaps from a Proto-Indo-European root \"bhre-n-u\", from base root \"bhereu-\" \"to boil forth, well up.\" In Dutch, \"(ver)branden\" mean \"to burn\", \"brandmerk\" a branded mark; similarly, in German, \"Brandzeichen\" means \"a brand\" and \"brandmarken\", \"to brand\".\n\nSometimes, the word \"cauterize\" is used. This is known in English since 1541, and is derived via Medieval French \"cauteriser\" from Late Latin \"cauterizare\" \"to burn or brand with a hot iron\", itself from Greek καυτηριάζειν, \"kauteriazein\", from καυτήρ \"kauter\" \"burning or branding iron\", from καίειν \"kaiein\" \"to burn\". However \"cauterization\" is now generally understood to mean a medical process – specifically to stop bleeding.\n\nThe origin may be the ancient treatment of a slave (often without legal rights) as livestock.\n\nIn criminal law, branding with a hot iron was a mode of punishment consisting of marking the subject as if goods or animals, sometimes concurrently with their reduction of status in life.\n\nBrand marks have also been used as a punishment for convicted criminals, combining physical punishment, as burns are very painful, with public humiliation (greatest if marked on a normally visible part of the body) which is here the more important intention, and with the imposition of an indelible criminal record.\nRobbers, like runaway slaves, were marked by the Romans with the letter F (\"fur\"); and the toilers in the mines, and convicts condemned to figure in gladiatorial shows, were branded on the forehead for identification. Under Constantine I the face was not permitted to be so disfigured, the branding being on the hand, arm or calf.\n\nThe Acts of Sharbil record it applied, amongst other tortures, to a Christian between the eyes and on the cheeks in Parthian Edessa at the time of the Roman Emperor Trajan on a judge's order for refusal to sacrifice.\n\nIn the 16th century, German Anabaptists were branded with a cross on their foreheads for refusing to recant their faith and join the Roman Catholic church.\n\nIn the North-American Puritan settlements of the 17th century, men and women sentenced for adultery were branded with an \"A\" letter on their chest, and for other crimes, such as \"D\" for drunkenness and \"B\" for blasphemy.\n\nThe mark in later times was also often chosen as a code for the crime (e.g. in Canadian military prisons D for Desertion, BC for Bad Character; most branded men were shipped off to a penal colony). Branding was used for a time by the Union Army during the American Civil War. Surgeon and Oxford English Dictionary contributor William Chester Minor was required to brand deserters at around the time of the Battle of the Wilderness.\n\nUntil 1832 in France, various offenses carried the additional infamy of being branded with a fleur de lis and galley-slaves could be branded GAL or, once the galleys were replaced by the \"bagnes\" on land, TF (\"travaux forcés\", 'forced' labor, i.e. hard labour) or TFP (\"travaux forcés à perpetuité\", hard labour for life). In most of the German-speaking states, however, branding people was unlawful. \n\nFollowing the Conspiracy of the Slaves of 1749 in Malta, some slaves were branded with the letter R (for \"ribelli\") on their forehead and condemned to the galleys for life.\n\nBranding tended to be abolished like other judicial mutilations (with notable exceptions, such as amputation under sharia law), sooner and more widely than flogging, caning, and similar corporal punishments, which normally aim 'only' at pain and at worst cause stripe scars, although the most severe lashings (not uncommon in penal colonies) in terms of dosage and instrument (such as the proverbial knout) can even turn out to cause death.\n\nIn Louisiana, there was a \"black code\", or \"Code Noir\", which allowed the cropping of ears, shoulder branding, and hamstringing, the cutting of tendons near the knee, as punishments for recaptured slaves. Slave owners used extreme punishments to stop flight, or escape. They would often brand the slaves' palms, shoulders, buttocks, or cheeks with a branding iron.\n\nBranding was sometimes used to mark recaptured runaway slaves to help the locals easily identify the runaway. Mr. Micajah Ricks, in Raleigh, North Carolina, was looking for his slave and described, \"I burnt her with a hot iron, on the left side of her face, I tried to make the letter M.\"\n\nMost slave owners would use whipping as their main method, but at other times they would use branding to punish their slaves. Another testimony explains how a slave owner in Kentucky around 1848 was looking for his runaway slave. He described her having \"a brand mark on the breast something like L blotched.\" In South Carolina, there were many laws which permitted the punishments slaves would receive. When a slave ran away, if it was the first offense, the slave would receive no more than forty lashes. Then the second offense would be branding. The slave would have been marked with the letter R on their forehead signifying that they were a criminal, and a runaway.\n\nCeremonial Branding is an integral part of religious initiation in most Vaishnava sects. References to this practice can be traced in texts such as Narad Panchratra, Vaikhnasagama, Skanda Purana etc. This practice is still in vogue among Madhava sect Brahmins of Karnataka in India.\n\nThe punishment was adopted by the Anglo-Saxons, and the ancient law of England authorized the penalty. By the \nStatute of Vagabonds (1547) under King Edward VI, vagabonds and Gypsies were ordered to be branded with a large V on the breast, and brawlers with F for \"fraymaker\"; slaves who ran away were branded with S on the cheek or forehead. This law was repealed in England in 1550. From the time of Henry VII, branding was inflicted for all offences which received Benefit of clergy (branding of the thumbs was used around 1600 at Old Bailey to ensure that the accused who had successfully used the Benefit of Clergy defence, by reading a passage from the Bible, could not use it more than once), but it was abolished for such in 1822. In 1698 it was enacted that those convicted of petty theft or larceny, who were entitled to benefit of clergy, should be \"burnt in the most visible part of the left cheek, nearest the nose.\" This special ordinance was repealed in 1707. James Nayler, a Quaker who in the year 1655 was accused of claiming to be the Messiah, was convicted of blasphemy in a highly publicized trial before the Second Protectorate Parliament and had his tongue bored through and his forehead branded B for \"blasphemer\".\n\nIn the Lancaster Criminal Court, a branding iron is still preserved in the dock. It is a long bolt with a wooden handle at one end and an M (malefactor) at the other; close by are two iron loops for firmly securing the hands during the operation. The brander would, after examination, turn to the judge exclaiming \"A fair mark, my lord.\" Criminals were formerly ordered to hold up their hands before sentence to show if they had been previously convicted.\n\nIn the 18th century, cold branding or branding with cold irons became the mode of nominally inflicting the punishment on prisoners of higher rank. \"When Charles Moritz, a young German, visited England in 1782 he was much surprised at this custom, and in his diary mentioned the case of a clergyman who had fought a duel and killed his man in Hyde Park. Found guilty of manslaughter he was burnt in the hand, if that could be called burning which was done with a cold iron\" (Markham's \"Ancient Punishments of Northants\", 1886).\n\nSuch cases led to branding becoming obsolete, and it was abolished in 1829 except in the case of deserters from the army, who were marked with the letter D, not with hot irons but by tattooing with ink or gunpowder. Notoriously bad soldiers were also branded with BC (bad character). The British Mutiny Act of 1858 provided that the court-martial might, in addition to any other penalty, order deserters to be marked on the left side, 2 inches (5 cm) below the armpit, with the letter D, such letter to be not less than an inch long. In 1879 this was abolished.\n\nOffenders in Australia were subject to branding in accordance with British law. In 1826, in Hobart, Joseph Clarke was charged with manslaughter and ‘sentenced to be burnt in the hand’. In 1850, in New South Wales, deserter Daniel O’Neil was tattooed with the letter ‘D’. \n\nBranding in Russia was used quite extensively in the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. Over time, red hot iron brands were gradually replaced by tattoo boards; criminals were first branded on the forehead and cheeks, later on the back and arms. Branding was totally abolished in 1863.\n\nForced and enslaved prostitutes have often been tattooed or branded with a mark of their owners. Women and girls being forced into prostitution would have their boss’s name or gang symbol inked or branded with hot iron on their skin. In some organizations involved with the trafficking of women and girls like the mafias nearly all prostitutes are marked. Some pimps and organisations use their name or well-known symbol, others are using secret signs.\n\nThe branding is both painful and humiliating for the victim, especially when done with a branding iron, and may be also a form of punishment and of psychological submission for the prostitutes.\n\nSome years ago the brands were usually small, only recognized by other pimps, sometimes hidden between the inner vaginal lips, though other instances show that pimps have no issue with larger, more noticeable brands.\n\n\nIn symbolic solidarity with Calf 269, protesters in Israel subjected themselves to branding on World Farm Animals Day (Gandhi's birthday): October 2, 2012. This act was emulated by others in England and the Czech Republic. An English protester who was interviewed justified the extremism as a reaction to the extreme cruelty perpetrated by the dairy industry such as shooting calves at birth.\n\n\n"}

It is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, but has spread to many other locations, including North America, Australia, and the Philippines.\n\nThe small hive beetle can be a destructive pest of honey bee colonies, causing damage to comb, stored honey, and pollen. If a beetle infestation is sufficiently heavy, they may cause bees to abandon their hive. Its presence can also be a marker in the diagnosis of colony collapse disorder for honey bees. The beetles can also be a pest of stored combs, and honey (in the comb) awaiting extraction. Beetle larvae may tunnel through combs of honey, feeding and defecating, causing discoloration and fermentation of the honey.\n\nThe small hive beetle was first discovered in the United States in 1996 and has now spread to many U.S. states including, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. The movement of migratory beekeepers from Florida may have transported the beetle to other states. Recent findings also indicate transport of the beetles in packages.\n\nIn Canada, the small hive beetle has been detected in Manitoba (2002 and 2006), Alberta (2006), Québec (2008, 2009), Ontario (2010), British Columbia (2015), and New Brunswick (2017). In the Prairie Provinces, measures were taken to control the pest, and small hive beetles failed to establish a population. It is still to be determined whether the small hive beetle has been able to establish a resident population in Ontario or Québec. In the summer of 2015, the discovery of a number of adult beetles as well as one infestation in all stages of brood in British Columbia's Fraser Valley triggered a temporary quarantine.\n\nIn Mexico, the small hive beetle has become established in at least eight states. Infestation levels are especially high in tropical areas such as the Yucatán.\n\nThe small hive beetle was first detected in Belize in 2016 in the Corozal District.\n\nThe small hive beetle has also spread to Australia, being first identified at Richmond, NSW in 2002. Subsequently, it has affected many areas of Queensland and New South Wales. It seems plausible to assume that the import of package bees, honeybee or bumblebee colonies, queens, hive equipment or even soil constituted the potential invasion pathway of the small hive beetle; however, at the current state of evidence it is still unclear how small hive beetles actually reached Australia.\n\nThe small hive beetle has now reached the southern Philippines in southern Mindanao, and there is great concern that it will spread through the country if hives and bees are moved from the southern Mindanao area where the beetle has already been identified.\n\nSince 2015 the beetle is present in Southern Italy (Calabria and Sicily) and some areas have been quarantined.\n\n\"Aethina tumida\" was previously known only from the sub-Saharan regions of Africa where it has been considered a minor pest of bees. The life cycle information is known primarily from studies in South Africa.\n\nThe small hive beetle is a member of the family of scavengers or sap beetles. The adult beetle is dark brown to black and about 5–6 mm in length. The adults may live up to 6 months and can be observed almost anywhere in a hive, although they are most often found on the rear portion of the bottom board of a hive. Female beetles lay irregular masses of eggs in cracks or crevices in a hive. The eggs hatch in 2–3 days into white-colored larvae that will grow to 10–11 mm in length. Larvae feed on pollen and honey, damaging combs, and require about 10–16 days to mature. Larvae that are ready to pupate leave the hive and burrow into soil near the hive. The pupation period may last approximately 3–4 weeks. Newly emerged adults seek out hives, and females generally mate and begin egg laying about a week after emergence. Adult female small hive beetles generally are longer at 5.7 mm than males which are 5.5 mm long, but both are nearly identical in width at about 3.2 mm, although they can vary greatly in size, possibly depending on diet, climate, and other environmental factors. 6 July 2010. Hive beetles may have 4–5 generations a year during the warmer seasons.\n\nThe primary damage to colonies and stored honey caused by the small hive beetle is through the feeding activity of the larvae.\nLarvae tunnel through comb with stored honey or pollen, damaging or destroying cappings and comb. Larvae defecate in honey, and the honey becomes discolored from the feces. Activity of the larvae causes fermentation and a frothiness in the honey; the honey develops a characteristic odor of decaying oranges. Damage and fermentation cause honey to run out of combs, creating a mess in hives or extracting rooms. Heavy infestations cause bees to abscond; some beekeepers have reported the rapid collapse of even strong colonies.\n\nThe small hive beetle is considered a secondary pest in South Africa, and as such, has not been the subject of major control efforts. The beetle is most often found in weak or failing hives and rarely affects strong hives. However, differences in the housecleaning traits of the bees found in South Africa and the U.S. may mean very different responses to the beetles. Some early reports from Florida and South Carolina suggest the beetles may be more damaging there than in Africa. Para-dichlorobenzene (PDB) has been used for protecting empty stored combs. Coumaphos bee strips (Bayer Corporation) have been approved for use in hives for the control of small hive beetles in some states under an emergency registration.\n\nBiological control through beneficial soil nematodes specific to the SHB is also effective.\n\nBeneficial nematodes are used by applying them to the soil while suspended in water. They may be applied as a pressurized spray or simply poured from a watering can. Nematodes applied to the soil, burrow downward in search of insect pests. Once found, nematodes enter the body of the insect and release a powerful bacterium which quickly kills the pest. Released bacteria dissolve the internal tissues of the insect which becomes food for nematode growth and development. Matured nematodes then mate and lay eggs to produce more nematodes within the dead insect. Several such generations may occur over just a few days. After the inside of an insect is consumed, tiny infective stage nematodes leave the dead insect shell and begin searching for more pests. As many as 350,000 nematodes may emerge from a single dead insect after only 10–15 days. Numbers depend on insect size.\n\nThere are also several traps currently on the market. The more effective ones are the Beetlejail Baitable, Hood Trap, the Freeman Beetle Trap, the West trap, the Australian, AJ's Beetle Eater, and the Beetle Blaster. All these traps use non-toxic oil to suffocate the beetles. This allows beekeepers to avoid having toxic chemicals in their beehives.\n\nIn New South Wales, Australia, infestation of hives by small hive beetle is notifiable as a honey bee pest under the Stock Diseases Act 1923. The maximum penalty for failing to notify is $11,000.\n\n\n"}

Pickle Research Campus (PRC) in Austin, Texas, United States is owned and operated by the University of Texas at Austin. It sits on 475 acres (1.9 km²) in northwest Austin, approximately 9 miles (14 km) north of the main UT campus and just south of the Domain.\n\nThe original site was only 402 acres (1.6 km²) and only extended as far west as the railroad. It was originally a magnesium plant during World War II and was owned by the United States government. Following the conclusion of the war, the site was declared surplus, and UT engineering professors C. Read Granberry and J. Neils Thompson sought to lease and eventually purchase the site for the University. The lease agreement was reached in 1946, and certain research projects began to be moved to the new campus.\n\nIn 1949, with the help of then-Congressman Lyndon B. Johnson, the University purchased the site, now named the Off-Campus Research Center (OCRC), from the federal government. In 1953, it became the Balcones Research Center, so named for the Balcones Escarpment which runs through that part of the city.\n\nOver the years, the University continued to develop the campus, whose tenants made significant contributions to research in the areas of defense, nuclear physics, and space flight. It received a clear title to the property in 1971, and in 1974 purchased another tract of land west of the railroad, bringing the site to its current area.\n\nThe University again renamed the campus in 1994, this time for former Congressman and UT alumnus J. J. Pickle. When he was Austin's congressional representative, Pickle was instrumental in bringing major research efforts to the campus. Pickle died in 2005.\n\nThe Pickle Research Campus is not a full college campus: there are no dormitories, and most classes held there are for working professional programs (such as the Executive Masters program). Other than normal campus operations and a cafeteria / conference center, it is strictly a research facility.\n\nDue to the sensitive nature of some of the research being done at the PRC, it is also a closed campus. On a normal weekday, access to the campus is restricted to University students, faculty, and staff with parking permits, as well as expected guests. After hours or on weekends, access is restricted to approved personnel only. A shuttle runs between the two campuses on weekdays. Many students and some faculty/staff, especially those living in north Austin, opt to park at PRC and ride the shuttle due to the limited parking on the main campus.\n\nToday, the campus houses approximately 100 buildings. Many of the campus's original 29 buildings, most of which were built in the early 1940s, are still in use today. The vast majority of the campus is contained on the original site. Additionally, part of the west tract between Loop 1 and US 183 has been leased to retailers such as Office Depot.\n\nIn 2003, the UT System Board of Regents and Simon Property Group reached a $130 million lease agreement under which Simon would build a shopping mall on 46 acres (186,000 m²) of unused PRC land along Loop 1 and across from another Simon Property Group venture - the Domain. Construction on the Arbor Walk began in 2005, with its first retail stores opening in October 2006.\n\nDespite all this, a significant amount of the campus remains undeveloped. While there are roads throughout the campus, many of them border empty plots of land. UT administrators have announced plans to eventually develop the PRC into a full-fledged campus, but they are only preliminary. Visitors will also observe numerous bluebonnets, the Texas state flower, at the PRC. They are visible outside the campus from Burnet Road, but can be found in various places throughout the site.\n\n\nThe campus is served via Capital Metro as well, through a stop known as UT Research Campus.\n\nThe buses that serve this stop are:\n\n"}

A unique gameplay feature, however, is the ability to play as Venom, who controls differently from Spider-Man and has his own series of side missions. The game's story is set in the universe of the \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" comic book series and depicts the conflict between Spider-Man and Venom from both of their perspectives, as well as their attempt to uncover the secret behind Bolivar Trask's company and his involvement in the creation of the Venom symbiote and the death of both Spider-Man and Venom's fathers.\n\nA prequel, \"\", was released one year later, in 2006.\n\nThe game begins with a recap of Spider-Man/Peter Parker (voiced by Sean Marquette)\nexplaining how he came to become a superhero and how his and Eddie Brock's fathers worked together to find a cure for cancer. After signing a contract with Trask Industries, they lost ownership of \"the suit,\" which was the only one made and remained incomplete. This \"Venom\" suit would be capable of healing the wearer. The dangerous and incomplete Venom suit is kept by Trask Industries after Eddie Sr. and Richard Parker die in a plane crash.\n\nYears after, Eddie Jr. and Peter reunite and discover the Venom suit is their inheritance. After learning how his dad had been cheated by Trask Industries, Spider-Man breaks into the vault containing the Venom suit and is covered by a portion of it, creating his black suit. It enhances his superhuman abilities to new levels but also tries consuming him and leaves him drained by the experience. Eddie soon finds out and learns Peter's secret identity, taking the rest of the Venom suit for himself, imbuing himself with an incomplete, monstrous, and feral Venom symbiote, lacking the white spider symbol on his chest. They fight each other on Midtown High School's football field until Venom is electrocuted by a downed power line. Adrian Toomes secretly witnesses this confrontation and contacts someone about the Venom suit. Three months later, Peter has resumed his normal life. He wins a friendly race against the Human Torch throughout Queens and easily defeats Shocker. Meanwhile, Eddie, who survived their last confrontation, has been forced to feed on the life energy of civilians to prevent the suit from consuming him.

Spider-Man discovers it is R.H.I.N.O., a giant, rhinoceros-themed mecha suit. He defeats R.H.I.N.O. and leaves timid scientist Alexander O'Hirn for the police to find. That night, Silver Sable and her Wild Pack, having been contracted by Bolivar Trask to retrieve his \"property,\" attack Venom, who easily escapes and decimates Sable's forces. \n\nDuring a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Peter senses Venom on the roof and confronts him. The fight proves a challenge for Spider-Man since getting too close to Venom for too long induces massive headaches, but he still manages to win. Venom is captured by Silver Sable, who Spidey assumes works for S.H.I.E.L.D.

Venom returns to Trask, revealing he had more control of the suit around Spider-Man, accidentally revealing Spidey's secret identity. This leads Trask to realize Richard Parker's DNA was used as the basis for the Venom suit, which was why Peter managed to use it effectively, though only for a short time due to Peter lacking full compatibility. Silver Sable takes Eddie to hunt Peter down, but he transforms and escapes.\n\nMeanwhile, a mercenary who calls himself the Beetle attacks New York by freeing the Green Goblin from his prison and stealing a vial containing a sample of the Sandman. After a brief fight on a construction site, the Beetle manages to escape from Spider-Man. When asking the nearby people if they have seen the Beetle pass by, they point to the Latverian Embassy. When Spider-Man tries to infiltrate the Embassy, Green Goblin emerges, forcing Spider-Man to pursue him to the U.N. building. After being defeated, Green Goblin is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody by Sharon Carter. The Beetle is later dispatched to collect a sample of the Venom suit, but Venom defeats him.\n\nSilver Sable attacks Peter and tries to bring him to Trask. They fight above the Queensboro Bridge before Venom appears and knocks Sable out. Peter fights Venom again, but both end up unconscious. Eddie awakens inside Trask Industries hearing Peter screaming as Toomes injects him with their own makeshift sample of the Venom suit, transforming him into Carnage. After fighting him throughout the building, Venom defeats and absorbs Carnage, spitting Peter out. The combination of the Carnage suit and the leftover Venom samples in Peter's blood grants Eddie complete control over the symbiote, with the white spider insignia appearing on Venom's body. A furious Eddie vows to kill Trask both for using him as a weapon and for Trask's role in his and Peter's fathers' deaths. Peter battles and subdues Venom before he can kill Trask, who finally gives up files on the boys' fathers.\n\nAs S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives, Peter reads the files and discovers that the reason for their parents' plane crash was due to Eddie Sr. trying on the Venom suit on board, losing control due to his incompatibility just like Eddie did and killing the pilot. There were only three survivors, and one of the witnesses was Peter's mother, who died in the ambulance. When Peter tells Fury that Eddie must see these files, Fury tells him that Eddie escaped. Days later, Eddie confronts Trask in a minimum security prison and brutally slays him. \n\nMeanwhile, Peter and Mary Jane look over the city atop a rooftop. When Peter vocalizes his worries about Eddie, Mary Jane replies by telling him not to worry about him, and that while Eddie was not there, she is. Peter responds by saying he's not sure if he's scared \"of\" Eddie, or \"for\" him. Elsewhere, a partially transformed Eddie leaps from a skyscraper, turning into Venom just before he hits the ground.\n\nIn \"Ultimate Spider-Man\", the player can experience a free-roaming city environment that covers Manhattan and parts of Queens. The player starts in story-mode where the game automatically switches between Spider-Man and Venom. Spider-Man travels by web swinging, but the player must shoot the web at an actual building to swing, much like in the previous game, \"Spider-Man 2\". Spider-Man uses acrobatic attacks. Venom travels by using his symbiote to pull himself and by performing massive jumps. Venom attacks using his claws and tendrils. Venom can also throw cars at targets and perform much more brutal attacks, including eating people in order to gain health. After completion of the main storyline, Venom becomes a playable character in the open-world as well, allowing the player to go on destructive rampages. However, the more chaos they cause, the more police attention they will receive, who will not stop until Venom is dead (similarly to the well-known \"Grand Theft Auto\" series).\n\nAs the game progresses, Spider-Man and Venom will have certain \"City Goals\" to accomplish in order to continue the storyline. There are additional activities throughout the game such as finding secret tokens, landmark tokens, comic book covers, and competing in races.\n\nSpider-Man plays similarly to his \"Spider-Man 2\" incarnation, using his trademark web shooters as his main method of transportation and combat, while Venom has to resort to jumping for long distances. Spider-Man's attacks are also generally weaker than Venom's. Venom can also leech life from enemies and civilians. The player has to do this constantly, as Venom's health is continuously depleting, even when he is not being attacked (the suit is feeding on Eddie, so he uses other people to feed it instead). Also, if Venom tries to eat a boss, then the boss would damage him from the inside.\n\nThe Game Boy Advance version of \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" is a side-scroller, divided into seven \"issues,\" each containing three chapters. The game allows players to control Spider-Man and Venom. This version features only three boss characters aside from the two leads: Shocker, Silver Sable, and Carnage.\n\nUnlike the console, PC, or Nintendo DS games, this version features a limited supply of Spider-Man's web fluid, it can be refilled only by picking up special markers scattered throughout levels or dropped by enemies. Additionally, players may choose to collect hidden power-ups to gain more web fluid capacity or gain new moves and abilities for both Spider-Man and Venom.\n\nThe Nintendo DS version of \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" is a side-scroller with a 3D environment. The game allows players to control Spider-Man and Venom. The gameplay differs greatly between both characters:\n\n\nThe game features a slightly modified storyline. For example, players will face Shocker in a battle that is much more difficult than its console incarnation. The game also features a multi-player mode, where players can unlock different characters and arenas for a head-to-head fight.\n\nThere is a limited edition exclusive to the PlayStation 2, which contains four character biographies (Ultimate Spider-Man, Ultimate Venom, Ultimate Carnage, and Ultimate Beetle), an interview with Stan Lee, a \"G4\" special entitled \"Making of \"Ultimate Spider-Man\"\", developer tips and tricks, and a special edition (also called \"Activision Edition\") \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" comic book containing scenes from issues #33-39. One of the concept arts in the special edition shows what happened when Beetle ducked into the Latverian Embassy as it shows him presenting the Sandman vial to Doctor Doom in some plot to develop Latverian super-soldiers.\n\nThe limited edition version comes in a different case sporting plain purple and red holographic sides (with a Venom symbol and Spider-Man symbol on each, respectively). The case also comes with a cardboard sleeve with a picture of Venom on it. The DVD surface itself has a new picture on it: purple instead of red, once again with Venom. The instruction manual matches this trend with the cover being a fight scene between the two. The limited edition features are accessed from a new menu titled \"Limited Edition\" via the unlockables screen.\n\n\"\", was released for Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS on November 14, 2006. It is also based on the same comic universe and a prequel to the game.\n\n\"Ultimate Spider-Man\" received \"generally positive\" and \"mixed or average\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\n\"CiN Weekly\" gave it a score of 88 out of 100 and stated that \"The true letdown... is that the master villains can still be supremely frustrating to defeat, requiring several replays and exhaustive bouts of highly patterned attacks.\" \"The New York Times\" gave it a positive-to-average review and said that the game was \"very entertaining, and the addition of Nemesis creates some interesting new situations, but over all there isn't a lot of variety; you fight, you race, you ramble around the city, and then you do it all again.\" \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and stated that \"Combat against dim-witted goons can become repetitive but missions offer diversity.\"\n"}

He studied at the universities of Berlin, Göttingen, Vienna, and Heidelberg, and began a practice in Karlsruhe in 1842. In 1849 he became a professor of theoretical medicine at the University of Tübingen, and in 1853 a professor of physiology.\n\nVierordt developed techniques and tools for the monitoring of blood circulation. He is credited with the construction of an early \"hemotachometer\", an apparatus for monitoring the velocity of blood flow. In 1854, he created a device called a sphygmograph, a mechanism consisting of weights and levers used to estimate blood pressure, and considered to be a forerunner of the modern sphygmomanometer. One of his better known written works was a treatise on the arterial pulse, titled \"Die Lehre vom Arterienpuls in gesunden und kranken Zuständen\".\n\nVierordt also made substantial contributions to the psychology of time perception, via his book (published in 1868) \"Der Zeitsinn nach Versuchen\", \"The experimental study of the time sense\". This reported a large number of experiments on the perception of duration, with the time sense being considered a \"general sense\" along with the perception of space, in contrast to the \"special senses\" such as vision and hearing. Included in this book is discussion of, and evidence for, what has come to be known as Vierordt's Law: roughly the proposition that short durations tend to be overestimated, while long durations tend to be underestimated.\n\nBetween these two extremes is a \"point of indifference\" where the \"time sensation\", in Vierordt's terminology, corresponds exactly to physical time. However, the 1868 book does much more than report this \"law\" and contains extensive discussions of different methods used to measure duration perception, as well as different sorts of errors that can occur.\n\nAlthough Vierordt was not the first person to carry out experiments on time perception, his 1868 book involved much more extensive experimentation and discussion than had been carried out until then.\n\nHe died in Tübingen, aged 66.\n\nSphygmograph\n\n"}

It was originally released as a double album in September 1974 by Mercury Records. The September 1988 CD re-release was issued as two separate single CD volumes, with one extra track per disc. Since many of the band's studio albums were out of print in the USA from the early 1970s through the mid-1980s, \"1969\" was one of the more popular albums by the band, and is a fan favorite. \"Spin\" magazine's Alternative Record Guide included it in the top 100 alternative albums of all time in 1995.\n\nDuring 1969, the Velvet Underground toured the United States and Canada, playing well over 70 dates. By this time, the band had picked up a sizeable fan base and every now and then a fan would bring along, with consent of the band, recording equipment to record a set.\n\nMost of the time, this would mean relatively simple hand-held recorders resulting in lo-fi audience recordings. On two occasions, however, professional equipment was used. On October 19, 1969, in the End of Cole Ave. club, Dallas, a fan who happened to be a recording engineer brought along his professional gear; and in November at The Matrix in San Francisco, the band was given permission to use the in-house four-track recording desk.\n\nThe band were given two-track mixdown tapes from the recordings for reference, but nothing was done with them until 1974, after the band had dissolved and Lou Reed had become well known as a solo artist. According to bassist Doug Yule, \"The release of \"1969 Live\"... was started by Steve Sesnick [former band manager], who had the tapes and was trying to sell them to get money for himself claiming that he owned the [band] name and the rights to the album... Somehow somebody else got involved and contacted other people in the group and basically Sesnick got done. [Lou Reed's management] took the tapes and said 'It's not yours' and released it\".\n\nThe mixdown tapes were submitted to Mercury Records, who agreed to release a compilation of the best performances as a double album. The compiling was done by music critic Paul Nelson, who at the time was working in A&R (artists and repertoire) at Mercury. When \"1969\" was released, it immediately became subject of a lawsuit as The Matrix's management had never given permission for their material to be used on a commercial release. The matter was settled out of court.\n\nThe tracks on \"1969\" are for the most part of good sound quality, resulting from four-track recording equipment being used. Some of the tracks feature light crackling, however, as they were sourced from acetates, the original tapes having been lost. The CD release is worse in this regard, as it appears that some tracks were sourced from a vinyl copy of the album. There is little ambiance or audience sound, however, because no audience mic was used and so the only ambience the listener gets is whatever little the vocal and drums mics picked up. This makes the record sound relatively flat and small and makes it seem that only a handful of people were present.\n\nAt the time of the album's release, three of its songs (\"We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together\", \"Over You\" and \"Sweet Bonnie Brown\"/\"It's Just Too Much\") had never been released in any form, two (\"Lisa Says\" and \"Ocean\") were previously only known from the versions on Reed's debut solo album, and \"New Age\" and \"Sweet Jane\" were radically different from the eventual \"Loaded\" studio versions. In addition, much of the rest of the album lends credence to a popular saying about the band—that they would not (or could not) play a song the same way twice. In particular, \"I'm Waiting For The Man\" (here called \"Waiting For My Man\") is performed in a country-rock manner; \"Femme Fatale\" is louder and more aggressive, and \"White Light/White Heat\" is extended from two-and-a-half minutes to over eight minutes of avant-garde guitar improvisation. The album is also notable for featuring songs sung by different singers from the album versions: Reed sings \"New Age\" (later sung by Yule on \"Loaded\") and \"Femme Fatale\" (originally sung by Nico) and Yule sings \"I'll Be Your Mirror\" (also originally by Nico).\n\nThe album contained liner notes by Paul Nelson and by singer/songwriter Elliott Murphy. Despite being present in the gatefold photo with Reed, Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker at The Factory, John Cale does not feature on the album.\n\nAll tracks written by Lou Reed.\n\nWhen issued on CD by PolyGram in 1988, the double album (which always sold for the price of a single album) was split into two budget-priced CDs. As denoted in bold above, each CD contains one previously unreleased bonus track not on the original release. Many tracks, in particular \"Beginning to See the Light\" and \"Over You,\" appear to be recorded straight from a vinyl edition of the album (as opposed to being from the same original sources used to compile the initial LP release).\n\nThe complete master tapes for the Matrix shows were rediscovered in the 2010s and have been remixed and remastered as 2015's \"The Complete Matrix Tapes\", which, as implied by the title, features the unexpurgated Matrix recordings over four compact discs.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2185671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2185671", "title": "Media richness theory", "text": "Media richness theory\n\nMedia richness theory, sometimes referred to as information richness theory or MRT, is a framework used to describe a communication medium's ability to reproduce the information sent over it. It was introduced by Richard L. Daft and Robert H. Lengel in 1986 as an extension of information processing theory. MRT is used to rank and evaluate the richness of certain communication media, such as phone calls, video conferencing, and email. For example, a phone call cannot reproduce visual social cues such as gestures which makes it a less rich communication media than video conferencing, which affords the transmission of gestures and body language. Based on contingency theory and information processing theory, MRT theorizes that richer, personal communication media are generally more effective for communicating equivocal issues in contrast with leaner, less rich media.\n\nMedia richness theory was introduced in 1986 by Richard L. Daft and Robert H. Lengel. Leaning on information processing theory for its theoretical foundation, MRT was originally developed to describe and evaluate communication media within organizations. In presenting media richness theory, Daft and Lengel sought to help organizations cope with communication challenges, such as unclear or confusing messages, or conflicting interpretations of messages.\n\nOther communication scholars have tested the theory in order to improve it, and more recently Media Richness Theory has been retroactively adapted to include new media communication media, such as video telephony, online conferencing, and online coursework. Although media richness theory relates to media use, rather than media choice, empirical studies of the theory have often studied what medium a manager would choose to communicate over, and not the effects of media use.\n\nSince its introduction, media richness theory has been applied to contexts outside of organizational and business communication (See \"\"Application\"\" section).\n\nInformation richness is defined by Daft and Lengel as \"the ability of information to change understanding within a time interval\".\n\nMedia richness theory states that all communication media vary in their ability to enable users to communicate and to change understanding. The degree of this ability is known as a medium's \"richness.\" MRT places all communication media on a continuous scale based on their ability to adequately communicate a complex message. Media that can efficiently overcome different frames of reference and clarify ambiguous issues are considered to be richer whereas communications media that require more time to convey understanding are deemed less rich.\n\nA primary driver in selecting a communication medium for a particular message is to reduce the equivocality, or possible misinterpretations, of a message. If a message is equivocal, it is unclear and thus more difficult for the receiver to decode. The more equivocal a message, the more cues and data needed to interpret it correctly. For example, a simple message intended to arrange a meeting time and place could be communicated in a short email, but a more detailed message about a person's work performance and expectations would be better communicated through face-to-face interaction.\n\nThe theory includes a framework with axes going from low to high equivocality and low to high uncertainty. Low equivocality and low uncertainty represents a clear, well-defined situation; high equivocality and high uncertainty indicates ambiguous events that need clarification by managers. Daft and Lengel also stress that message clarity may be compromised when multiple departments are communicating with each other, as departments may be trained in different skill sets or have conflicting communication norms.\n\nIn their 1988 article regarding media richness theory, Daft and Lengel state, \"The more learning that can be pumped through a medium, the richer the medium.\" Media richness is a function of characteristics including the following:\n\nMedia richness theory predicts that managers will choose the mode of communication based on aligning the equivocality of the message to the richness of the medium. In other words, communication channels will be selected based on how communicative they are. However, often other factors, such as the resources available to the communicator, come into play. Daft and Lengel's prediction assumes that managers are most concentrated on task efficiency (that is, achieving the communicative goal as efficiently as possible) and does not take into consideration other factors, such as relationship growth and maintenance. Subsequent researchers have pointed out that attitudes towards a medium may not accurately predict a person's likelihood of using that medium over others, as media usage is not always voluntary. If an organization's norms and resources support one medium, it may be difficult for a manager to choose another form to communicate his or her message.\n\nSocial presence refers to the degree to which a medium permits communicators to experience others as being psychologically present or the degree to which a medium is perceived to convey the actual presence of the communicating participants. Tasks that involve interpersonal skills, such as resolving disagreements or negotiation, demand high social presence, whereas tasks such as exchanging routine information require less social presence. Therefore, face-to-face media like group meetings are more appropriate for performing tasks that require high social presence; media such as email and written letters are more appropriate for tasks that require low social presence.\n\nAnother model that is related to media richness theory as an alternative, particularly in selecting an appropriate medium, is the social influence model. How we perceive media, in this case to decide where a medium falls on the richness scale, depends on \"perceptions of media characteristics that are socially created,\" reflecting social forces and social norms at play in the current environment and the context that determines the needed use. Each organization is different in the goal that is trying to be reached and the missions that are trying to be completed. Thus, with different organizational cultures and environments, the way each organization perceives a medium is different and as a result, the way each organization uses media and deems media as more or less rich will vary.\n\nCommunicators also consider how personal a message is when determining the appropriate media for communication. In general, richer media are more personal as they include nonverbal and verbal cues, body language, inflection, and gestures that signal a person's reaction to a message. Rich media can promote a closer relationship between a manager and subordinate. The sentiment of the message may also have an influence on the medium chosen. Managers may want to communicate negative messages in person or via a richer media, even if the equivocality of the message is not high, in order to facilitate better relationships with subordinates. On the other hand, sending a negative message over a leaner medium would weaken the immediate blame on the message sender and prevent them from observing the reaction of the receiver.\n\nAs current business models change, allowing more employees to work outside the office, organizations must rethink the reliance on face-to-face communication. Furthermore, the fear of more lean channels must be rid of. In this current context, managers must decided through trial and errors which medium is best used for various situations, namely an employee that works from the office vs. an employee that works outside the office. Business is being conducted on a global scale. In order to save money and cut back on travel time, organizations must adopt new media in order to stay up-to-date with business functions in the modern times.\n\nIn April 1993, Valacich et al. suggested that in light of new media, \"concurrency\" be included as an additional characteristic to determine a medium's richness. They define environmental concurrency to represent \"the communication capacity of the environment to support distinct communication episodes, without detracting from any other episodes that may be occurring simultaneously between the same or different individuals.\" Furthermore, they explain that while this idea of concurrency could be applied to the media described in Daft and Lengel's original theories, new media provide a greater opportunity for concurrency than ever before.\n\nMedia richness theory was originally conceived in an organizational communication setting to better understand interaction within companies. MRT is used to determine the \"best\" medium for an individual or organization to communicate a message. For example, organizations may find that important decisions need to be discussed in face-to-face interactions; using email would not be an adequate channel.\n\nFrom an organizational perspective, high level personnel may require verbal media to help solve many of their problems. Entry-level positions with clear, unambiguous tasks may be fulfilled with written media forms. From an individual perspective, though, people prefer oral communication because the abundant communicative cues afford more accurate and efficient interpretation of the message.\n\nAn information-processing perspective of organizations also highlights the important role of communication. This perspective suggests that organizations gather information from their environment, process this information, and then act on it. As environmental complexity, turbulence, and information load increase, organizational communication increases. The organization's effectiveness in processing information becomes paramount when the business environment is complex and wrought with rapid change.\n\nToday, companies use technologies such as video conferencing, which enable participants to see each other even when in separate locations. This technology affords organizations the opportunity to have richer communication than via traditional conference calls which only provide audio cues to the participants involved.\n\nDaft and Lengel also assert that not all executives or managers in organizations demonstrate the same skill in making effective media choices for communications. High performing executives or managers tend to be more \"sensitive\" to richness requirements in media selection than low performing managers. In other words, competent executives select rich media for non-routine messages and lean media for routine messages.\n\nFrom the consensus and satisfaction perspectives, groups with a communication medium which is too lean for their task seem to experience more difficulties than groups with a communication medium which is too rich for their task. Additionally, face-to-face groups achieved higher consensus change, higher decision satisfaction and higher decision scheme satisfaction than dispersed groups.\n\nIn a job recruitment context, face-to-face interactions with company representatives, such as at career fairs, should be perceived by applicants as rich media. Career fairs allow instant feedback in the form of questions and answers and permit multiple cues including verbal messages and body gestures and can be tailored to each job seeker's interests and questions.\n\nIn comparison, static messages like reading information on a company's website or browsing an electronic bulletin board can be defined as leaner media since they are not customized to the individual needs of job seekers; they are asynchronous in their feedback and, since they are primarily text-based, there are no opportunities for verbal inflections or body gestures. This interaction between job seekers and potential employers affects how candidates process information about the organization. The interactions a candidate has with a potential employer via lean and rich media shape a job seeker's beliefs. Some employers have started using more vivid tools to answer questions about job recruitment such as videos, animations and virtual agents. Counterintuitively, elements which are more interactive like the US Army's virtual agent, Sgt. Starr, have been shown to hinder information transfer for ambiguous or complex messages such as a company's value or mission.\n\nMany organizations are distributed globally with employees on a single team located in many different time zones. In order to facilitate productive cooperation and team dynamics, organizations benefit from considering the technology tools that are provided for coworking and communication. Workman, Kahnweiler, and Bommer (2003) found that an ideal teleworking design would feature a variety of types of media, ranging from lean to rich, in which workers can choose the media that is most suitable for their working style and the task at hand. Further, different jobs may require different types of media. Jobs that are more concrete and structured like planning, administration or operations may be sustainable with lean media options while software design and development which inherently has much more uncertainty and negotiation is best supported by richer media channels.\n\nA 2009 study exploring the dynamics of virtual teams showed that the use of richer media in virtual work environments decreased perceived social loafing, or the feeling that a group member's individual contributions are not noticed or valued.\n\nThe concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR), which originally gained prominence in the 1960s, describes a company's self-regulation in the compliance of the ethical and moral standards. Public companies often describe their CSR efforts as an aspect of marketing campaigns in order to appeal to customers. Sat and Selemat (2014) found that customers were more affected by such messages when they were communicated through rich channels instead of lean ones.\n\nWhile media richness theory's application to new media has been contested (see \"\"Criticism\"\"), it is still used heuristically as a basis for studies examining new media.\n\nWebsites can vary in their richness. In a study examining representations of the former Yugoslavia on the World Wide Web, Jackson and Purcell proposed that hypertext plays a role in determining the richness of individual websites. They developed a framework of criteria in which the use of hypertext on a website can be evaluated in terms of media richness characteristics as set forth by Daft and Lengel in their original theoretical literature. Furthermore, in their 2004 article, Simon and Peppas examined product websites' richness in terms of multimedia use. They classified \"rich media sites\" as those that included text, pictures, sounds and video clips, while the \"lean media sites\" contained only text. In their study, they created four sites (two rich and two lean) to describe two products (one simple, one complex). They found that most users, regardless of the complexity of the product, preferred the websites that provided richer media.\n\nRich media on websites also has the potential to stimulate action in the physical world. Lu, Kim, Dou and Kumar (2014) demonstrated that websites with 3D views of a fitness center were more successful in creating a student's intention to visit the gym than a website with static 2D images.\n\nMedia richness theory implies that a sender should select a medium of appropriate richness to communicate the desired message or fulfill a specific task. Senders that use less-rich communication media must consider the limitations of that medium in the dimensions of feedback, multiple cues, message tailoring, and emotions. Take for example the relative difficulty of determining whether a modern text message is serious or sarcastic in tone. The leanness of the text prevents the transmission of tone and facial expression which would otherwise be useful in detecting the sarcasm. However, results from a study conducted by Anandarajan et al. on Generation Y's use of instant messaging conclude that \"the more users recognize IM as a rich communication medium, the more likely they believe this medium is useful for socialization.\" Though Generation Y users consider texting to be a rich medium, there is additional evidence that shows that easily accessible and non-intrusive media (i.e., texting, Twitter) were more likely to be used for sharing positive than negative events, and intrusive and rich media (i.e., phone calling) were more likely to be used for sharing negative than positive events. Additionally, in order to better understand teenagers' use of MSN (later called Microsoft Messenger service), Sheer examined the effect of both media richness and communication control. Among other findings, Sheer's study demonstrated that \"rich features, such as webcam and MSN Spaces seemingly facilitated the increase of acquaintances, new friends, opposite-sex friends, and, thus, the total number of friends.\"\n\nIn recent years, as the general population has become more e-mail savvy, the lines have blurred somewhat between face-to-face and e-mail communication. E-mail is now thought of as a verbal tool, with its capacity to enable immediate feedback, leverage natural language, and embed emotion via acronyms and emoticons.\n\nHowever, there is a downside of e-mail: volume overload. Emails often have large unnecessary quantities of information which is non-job essential and/or spam. Filtering through this junk does require additional time. The time required to manage email can cause an information overload. With excess email, people may feel that they will miss information due to the sheer volume on content they receive. Some individuals may find this volume to be a barrier to swift responses to emails.\n\nEmail do have the capacity to transmit more informational content than other channels such as voicemail. Perception of email as a rich platform varies among users though. This perception contributes to how the individual will use the channel. For some, the choice of content will differ. They may include images or videos if they recognize email as a rich channel whereas others may only leverage text. This perception also affects choice of linguistic features. Those that see email as similar to an oral channel will type differently than those who see email as a written channel.\n\nVideo conference software has been used not only for virtual teams in large companies, but also for classrooms and casual conversations. Software or Video Conferencing Systems (VCS) such as Skype and Google Hangouts allow for more visual cues than just audio conversations. Research suggests that VCS is somewhere between the telephone and face-to-face meetings in terms of media richness. Even though video conferencing does not have the same richness as face-to-face conversations, a study regarding video conferencing has said that richer content-presentation types were positively correlated with higher concentration levels but showed mixed results when correlated with perceived usefulness.\n\nKashian and Walther (2018) find that asynchronous communication is a better medium for reducing conflict between people who have generally positive opinions/attributions of their partners than does the face-to-face medium.  The authors credit relational intimacy and attending positive attributions made by the partners as a potential reason for overcoming asynchronous communication's alleged shortcomings as espoused by the media synchronicity theory, which “[contends] that synchronous media are best for convergent conflict communication” (2018, p. 7, citing Dennis et al., 2008). The authors conclude, “asynchronous CMC is a beneficial medium for online conflict among satisfied couples” (2018, p. 19).\n\nIn another study, Koutamanis et al. (2013) suggest that adolescents’ engagement through instant messaging may actually serve to improve their respective abilities to enter into in-person relationships in the real world.  The authors focus on textual communication via electronic means. Although the written word is generally considered to be one of the leanest forms of communication regardless of how it is delivered according to the media richness theory, this study illustrates how texting may enhance adolescents’ ability to later succeed with face-to-face interactions that come after a certain amount of interaction through textual correspondence.\n\nIn a 2016 article, Lisiecka et al. point out that, although it has been generally accepted that “media other than face-to-face are considered an obstacle rather than an equally effective means of information transfer” (2016, p. 13), their results suggest that computer-mediated communication “has become similarly natural and intuitive as face-to-face contacts” (2016, p. 13). \n\nTong and Walther (2015) argue that unlike predictions attributed to early computer-mediated communication theories like the media richness (Daft & Lengel, 1986) and media naturalness (Kock, 2004) theories, nonverbal communication may not be “essential to the behavioral transfer and perceptual interpretation of expectancies” (2015, p. 204).  And further suggest that face-to-face communication may negatively skew people's interactions if the participants’ first impressions are influenced by biases that are responsive to visual cues.\n\nDeception, in the context of communication theory, occurs when the sender knowingly conveys a false message to the receiver. According to Buller and Burgoon, \"deception occurs when communicators control the information contained in their messages to convey a meaning that departs from the truth as they know it.\" This idea is central to the Interpersonal deception theory. Additional research has analyzed the relationship between media richness and the communication of deceptive messages. Richer media, especially those that transmit non-verbal cues such tone of voice, facial expression or gestures, show lesser incidences of deceptive messages than lean media. By leveraging a richer media, interlocutors develop stronger affective bonds which mitigates the likelihood that one speaker will try to deceive another. When honesty is not considered the best policy, learner media, such as e-mail, allows for a stronger possibility of deception.\n\nIn evaluating students' satisfaction with distance courses, Sheppherd and Martz concluded that a course's use of media rich technology affected how students evaluated the quality of the course. Courses that utilized tools such as \"discussion forums, document sharing areas, and web casting\" were viewed more favorably. Lai and Chang in 2011 used media richness as a variable in their study examining user attitudes towards e-books, stating that the potential for rich media content like embedded hyperlinks and other multimedia additions, offered users a different reading experience than a printed book. Further research by Lan and Sie (2010), that within the category of text based communication channels, there are significant differences that should shape an instructor's choice of technology. They studied the use of SMS, email and RSS and found that SMS is suitable for fast delivery, email affords greater content richness and RSS is the ideal format for content presentation on front-end mobile devices.\n\nE-books and e-learning are becoming recurrent tools in the academic landscape. One of the key characteristics of e-learning is its capability to integrate different media, such as text, picture, audio, animation and video to create multimedia instructional material. Media selection in e-learning can be a critical issue because of the increased costs of developing non-textual e-learning materials. Learners can benefit from the use of richer media in courses that contain equivocal and complex content; however, learners achieve no significant benefit in either learner score or learner satisfaction from the use of richer media in courses containing low equivocal (numeric) content.\n\nThe transition from analog to digital record keeping in medical care has been at the forefront of medical innovation. Castro, Favela, and Gracia-Pena studied the effects of different media (face to face, telephone and videoconferencing) on nursing consultations in emergency calls. They found that while there were no efficacy differences between media, richer media did facilitate faster consultations and resolutions. Videoconferencing may result in less eye contact than if the nurse was face to face with the patient.\n\nDespite interpersonal communication being a key ingredient in medical encounters, and physician communication being one of the most important qualities patients indicate in their selection of a new doctor, healthcare organizations do not do a very good job helping their prospective patients understand how a new doctor would communicate with them in future encounters through their online biographies - most only providing \"lean\" biographies of text, and very few providing \"richer\" video introductions. Video introductions provide the opportunity to help patients actually see how a physician might interact within a consultation. Perrault and Silk tested what effects richer video introductions of doctors might have on patients when they are in this decision-making phase. They uncovered that when participants were exposed to a richer video introduction of the physician that uncertainty was reduced to a greater extent than when they were only exposed a lean, text-based biography. Participants were also more likely to choose to want to visit the doctor who provided the richer video introduction over the leaner text biography.\n\nMedia used online also has been successfully proven to stimulate civic engagement. Leveraging the Internet to facilitate public deliberation has been proven to be a successful and cost-effective way to engage large volumes of citizens. Studies have shown that mixed modality media (both rich and lean) can be useful in citizen education and engagement. Through the creation of new social networks and various online platforms, media allows for many more opportunities of \"greater visibility and community building potential of cultural citizenship's previous 'ephemeral' practices.\" The explosion of creativity on the internet can be linked to formal institutions such as government and education in order to allow for a broader participation base, leading to stronger engagement of citizens and gaining access to a wider range of insight and knowledge.\n\nMedia richness theory has been criticized by what many researchers saw as its deterministic nature. Markus argues that social pressures can influence media use much more strongly than richness, and in ways that are inconsistent with MRT's key tenets. It has also been noted that media richness theory should not assume that the feelings towards using a richer media in a situation are completely opposite to using a leaner media. In fact, media choice is complex and in general even if a rich media is considered to be the \"best\" to communicate a message, a leaner media may still be able to communicate the message. In addition, for some tasks, the type of media used will make no difference to the accuracy of the communicated message.\n\nIn selecting a medium for message transmission, an individual will also consider his or her comfort with the possible options. If an individual is uncomfortable or unfamiliar with using an email system to distribute a message, and view learning to send an email as more time-consuming and inefficient than simply having a group meeting, he or she may choose a richer medium instead of a more efficient medium. This behavior outcome, through irrational, is certainly a reflection upon the previously established experience.\n\nNgwenyama and Lee show that cultural and social background influence media choice by individuals in ways that are incompatible with predictions based on media richness theory; their paper received the Paper of the Year Award in the journal MIS Quarterly. Ngwenyama and Lee are not alone in their critiques regarding the limitations of media richness theory, particularly in regards to cultural and individual characteristics. Research by Ook Lee demonstrated that in a Confucian virtual work environment where showing respect is essential, a communication channel's ability to convey cultural protocol is more important than the richness of the channel. In 2009, Gerritsen's study concluded that in business contexts, culture does play a role in determining the receiver's preference of medium, perhaps in terms of the specific culture's threshold for uncertainty avoidance.\n\nAdditionally, Dennis, Kinney, and Hung found that in terms of the actual performance of equivocal tasks, the richness of a medium has the most notable effect on teams composed entirely of females. On the other hand, \"matching richness to task equivocality did not improve decision quality, time, consensus, or communication satisfaction for all-male or mixed-gender teams.\" Individually speaking, Barkhi demonstrated that communication mode and cognitive style can play a role in media preference and selection, suggesting that even in situations with identical messages and intentions, the \"best\" media selection can vary from person to person.\n\nAdditionally, because media richness theory was developed before widespread use of the internet, which also introduced media like email, chat rooms, instant messaging, smartphone, and more, some have questioned its ability to accurately predict what new media users may choose. Several studies have been conducted that examine media choice when given options considered to be \"new media\", such as voice mail and email. Blau, Weiser, and Eshet-Alkalai study the differences and similarities of perceived and actual outcomes for students who take the same class either online or in traditional classroom settings.  The authors conclude that face-to-face classroom settings are not superior to online classrooms.  Further, they also suggest that a “high level of medium naturalness might hinder the understanding of a very complicated type of knowledge”, which is the opposite of what the media richness theory predicts. El-Shinnaway and Markus hypothesized that, based on media richness theory, individuals would choose to communicate messages over the more rich medium of voice mail than via email, but found that even when sending more equivocal messages, the leaner medium of email was used. Also, it has been indicated that given the expanded capabilities of new media, media richness theory's unidimensional approach to categorizing different communication media in no longer sufficient to capture all the dimensions in which media types can vary.\n\nSeveral new theories have been developed based on Daft and Lengel's original framework. Kock (2004) argues that human non-lexical communication methods and apparatus, such as facial expressions, gestures, and body language, have evolved for millions of years, and as such, must be important to the naturalness of communication between people. Media Naturalness Theory hypothesizes that because face-to-face communication is the most \"natural\" method of communication, we should want our other communication methods to resemble face-to-face communication as closely as possible. While media richness theory places media on a scale that range from low to high in richness and places face-to-face communication at the top of the scale, Media Naturalness Theory thinks of face-to-face communication as the middle in a scale, and states that the further away one gets from face-to-face (either more or less rich), the more cognitive processing is required to comprehend a message.\n\nThe 2011 media compensation theory by Hantula, Kock, D'Arcy, and DeRosa refines Kock's media naturalness theory.  The authors explain that the media compensation theory has been developed to specifically address two paradoxes:\n\n\nThe authors grapple with how humans “who have not changed much in many millennia” (Hantula et al., 2011, p. 358) are able to successfully embrace and employ lean media, such as texting, considering their assumption that human evolution has progressed down a path toward, and adeptness for, face-to-face communication, and conclude that elements of the media naturalness theory can coexist with Carlson and Zmud's channel expansion theory.\n\nTo help explain media richness and its application to new media, media synchronicity theory was proposed. Synchronicity describes the ability of a medium to create the sense that all participants are concurrently engaged in the communication event. Media with high degrees of synchronicity, such as face-to-face meetings, offer participants the opportunity to communicate in real time, immediately observe the reactions and responses of others, and easily determine whether co-participants are fully engaged in the conversation.\n\nMedia synchronicity theory also states that each medium has a set of abilities and that every communication interaction is composed of two processes: conveyance and convergence. These abilities include: transmission velocity, parallelism, symbol sets, rehearsability, and reaccessability. Media richness is also related to adaptive structuration theory and social information processing theory, which explain the context around a communication that might influence media choice.\n\nChannel expansion theory was proposed by Carlson and Zmud (1999) to explain the inconsistencies found in several empirical studies. In these studies, the results showed that managers would employ \"leaner\" media for tasks of high equivocality. Channel expansion theory suggested that individual's media choice has a lot to do with individual's experience with the medium itself, with the communicator and also with the topic. Thus it is possible that an individual's experience with using a certain lean medium, will prompt that individual to use it for equivocal tasks. For example, a study by Kahai, Carroll, and Jestice (2007) showed that participants' familiarity with instant messaging led them to perceive the medium as richer than the virtual world known as Second Life. Participants' lack of experience with the objectively richer virtual world may have affected their perception when compared to the more familiar medium of instant messaging.\n\nHowever, the theory does not suggest that knowledge-building experiences will necessarily equalize differences in richness, whether objective or perceptually-based, across different media. Put in another way, knowledge-building experiences may be positively related to perceptions of the richness of email, but this does not necessarily mean that email will be viewed as richer than another medium, such as face-to-face interaction\n\n\n"}

However, it can be made as accurate as any competing method, but its numerical efficiency deteriorates with growing accuracy.\n\nMCTDH is designed for multi-dimensional problems, in particular for problems that are difficult or even impossible to attack in a conventional way. There is no or only little gain when treating systems with less than three degrees of freedom by MCTDH. MCTDH will in general be best suited for systems with 4 to 12 degrees of freedom. Because of hardware limitations it may in general not be possible to treat much larger systems. For a certain class of problems, however, one can go much further. The MCTDH program package has recently been generalised to enable the propagation of density operators.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2185685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2185685", "title": "Mark Geyer", "text": "Mark Geyer\n\nMark Geyer OAM (born 7 December 1967), is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. An Australian international and New South Wales State of Origin representative second-rower, he is a rugby league media identity. Geyer's club career was played primarily with Penrith, with whom he won a premiership in 1991, as well as the Balmain Tigers and the Western Reds. He is also the brother of fellow former professional rugby league footballer Matt Geyer. \n\nGeyer was part of the Triple M on-air team for the Sydney breakfast show called The Grill Team from 2009 to 2017 before moving to an evening slot—The Rush Hour—on the same station.\n\nIn 1987, Geyer established a regular first-grade place with the Penrith Panthers and was selected for the City Seconds team after only a handful of top grade appearances. He also played in Penrith's 1987 Reserve Grade Grand Final winning team that defeated the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 11-0 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. \n\nGeyer was first selected in the second row for New South Wales in game 3 of the 1989 State of Origin series, at Lang Park in Brisbane.\n\nHis 1990 season was largely lost to a succession of injuries that restricted him to just 12 games, though he did play in Penrith's maiden Grand Final appearance (an 18-14 loss to the Canberra Raiders) and from there was selected, along with Panthers teammates Greg Alexander, John Cartwright and Brad Fittler, for the 1990 Kangaroo tour. Geyer played in 11 games on the Kangaroo Tour, scoring 4 tries and earning his first Australian test jumper when he was selected on the bench for the first test against France at the Parc de Sports in Avignon.\n\nGeyer's form for the Panthers in 1991 again earned him selection for NSW during the State of Origin series. Geyer received a five-match suspension for an incident in the second game at a wet Sydney Football Stadium, which was preceded by a half-time confrontation with Queensland captain Wally Lewis in which referee David Manson and NSW captain Ben Elias had to stand between the two who twice almost came to blows. He was cited for an elbow to the head of Queensland fullback Paul Hauff, which sparked an all-in brawl. His suspension saw him unavailable for selection in the first test of the 1991 Trans-Tasman Test series against New Zealand in Melbourne, though after the Australians lost the test 24-8 a number of changes were made and Geyer's form was rewarded with selection in the second test in Sydney and the third in Brisbane. The Aussies went on to win the final two tests to wrap up the series 2-1.\n\nIn August 1991, he was thought to be out for the rest of the season after injuring his ankle ligaments in a training session, only to return for the major semifinal. However, despite his problems during the season, Geyer helped the minor premiers into the Grand Final where they gained revenge on Canberra with a 19-12 win that saw the Panthers win their first premiership since entering the competition in 1967. Geyer had a hand in all three of the Panthers tries on the day and was judged to be their best player, though his sin-binning for dissent by referee Bill Harrigan during the second half was thought to have cost him the Clive Churchill Medal as man of the match.\n\nHe spent the 1993 season with the Balmain Tigers. After leaving Penrith, the coach of Balmain at the time Alan Jones handed Geyer a lifeline. Speaking to the media in 2018 Geyer spoke of his time at Balmain saying \"It was shit to be honest, I didn't like it one bit,I didn't like travelling on the M4, which at the time only had two lanes all the way to Leichhardt Oval in peak hour then driving home in peak hour, take all that aside from it, the people involved with the Tigers at the time I loved. Alan Jones was the only coach in Sydney who would throw me a lifeline after I left Penrith in controversial circumstances\". \n\nIn 1994, Geyer spent a season playing with the Umina Beach Bunnies who play in the Central Coast Division Rugby League competition after leaving Balmain.\n\nGeyer played for the Western Reds from 1995 until 1997, before returning to the Panthers in 1998.\n\nIn 2000, Mark Geyer was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. He retired at the end of the 2000 season.\n\nSince his retirement, Geyer has written extensively about rugby league for various newspapers and sporting magazines.\n\nIn May 2010, he spoke out about his mid career drug and alcohol battle that lasted from 1992–1995 and how it almost ended his career. He said a large part of the drug usage was to simply trying to numb the pain of losing his best mate, former Penrith player Ben Alexander, who was killed in a car accident in 1992.\n\nGeyer was a regular panellist on rugby league talk show \"The Sunday Roast\" where he referred himself as 'the man of the people'. He was on Triple M in Sydney, as a breakfast presenter on The Grill Team Monday-to-Friday 6-9am with Matthew Johns and Gus Worland from August 2009 to 2017. He also appears on Triple M on Saturday mornings, presenting the 'Dead Set Legends' segment alongside Ray Warren.\n\nIn 2012, it was announced that Geyer joined Fox Sports (Australia) as part of their Rugby League coverage. He is a Panelist on NRL on FOX\n\nGeyer is actively involved in a number of charities, such as the Fight For Life charity boxing event, he is the ambassador for the Save Our Sons charity.\n\nIn response to the 2010–2011 Queensland floods, Geyer organised the 2011 Legends of Origin charity match which raised $455,345 for the recovery effort.\n\nOn Australia Day 2013, Mark was announced in the Honours List. He received an Order Of Australia medal for \"service to the sport of Rugby League football, and to the community through a range of charitable organisations.\"\n\nIn November 2017, Geyer announced that he would be leaving The Grill Team. He heads The Rush Hour on the same network.\n\nIn August 2019, Geyer claimed on Triple M's the Rush Hour that within 10 years at least one Sydney team in the NRL would no longer exist. Geyer went on to say “They will be extinct, they will die a slow death. We have too many teams in Sydney, it’s as simple as that\". Geyer then suggested that the NRL introduce a controversial KPI target system where Sydney clubs were measured on sponsorship dollars, average crowd figures, on-field success and their dedication to junior and grassroots rugby league. Geyer went on to explain about the KPI system saying “I don’t know how they would do it, there’s brainier guys than me at the moment, people who get paid to do this, but after five years, the club with the lowest points, guess what, they move to the Central Coast\".\n\nGeyer's younger brother Matt Geyer also played rugby league, initially with Mark at the Western Reds in 1997, before playing with the Melbourne Storm between 1998 and 2008.\n\nGeyer is married to the sister of former fellow Penrith players Greg Alexander and the late Ben Alexander.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2185691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2185691", "title": "Electric Eel Shock", "text": "Electric Eel Shock\n\nElectric Eel Shock (EES) are a three-piece garage rock band, formed in Tokyo in 1994. They first toured the United States in 1999.\n\nAkihito Morimoto, known as 'Aki' (guitar and vocals) and Kazuto Maekawa (bass) first met in high School in Osaka. Aki learned English from the lyrics of bands he liked. Akihito Morimoto and Kazuto Maekawa first formed an 80s metal cover band in high school called Caducious.\n\nMorimoto and Maekawa moved to Tokyo and played as guitarist and bassist in a five-piece pop rock band. Morimoto later said that one of the main reasons for this band's demise was that they acted on everything that they were told, and as a result soon became directionless. This helped form the attitude of Electric Eel Shock – that musicians should listen to the views of others, but should learn from their own mistakes.\n\nAfter the demise of the pop rock band, Morimoto and Maekawa stayed in Tokyo. Morimoto followed his passion of fishing and became a competitive angler (he still writes for Japan's largest fishing magazine, \"Basser Magazine\") and Maekawa joined The Apollos (a well-known Japanese funk band) as session bassist. Maekawa's low-slung bass and unkempt appearance was at odds with The Apollos' suited and polished image, and meant that his time in this role was short-lived. However, Maekawa left a lasting impression on their drummer, Tomoharu Ito (known as Gian, due to his similar appearance to a well-known Japanese comedian of that name). Gian, who had a day job making artificial teeth, was soon introduced to Morimoto, and the three started practicing together shortly afterwards.\n\nThe first incarnation of Electric Eel Shock was different from their current attributes. The band's first public performances were as an 11-piece group with keyboards, female vocals and French horns. It was not until the logistics of getting all of its members together on the same day to practice became unworkable that the band stripped down to a three-piece.\n\nGian took up playing with four drumsticks, and also gained a reputation for playing almost naked. Gian has been arrested once, in Hong Kong and fined HK$100, for playing this way.\n\nElectric Eel Shock decided against making demos and sending them to record companies. Instead, they quickly set up the Micro Music record label with their friends, and released their first full-length album, \"Maybe... I Think We Can Beat Nirvana\". They followed this with \"Live Punctured\".\n\nIn 1999, Electric Eel Shock recorded \"Slayers Bay Blues\" on an eight-track recorder, and made enough copies to begin their first concerts abroad. They had lined up a handful of dates in and around New York, including CBGB, with their friends Peelander-Z who had relocated there some time earlier. The gigs were a big success, and the handful of dates that were planned turned into an East Coast tour.\n\nShortly after returning to Japan, EES sold their property and left their homes. They returned to the US and toured almost constantly for the next two years. All the while, the band survived on the sale of CDs, t-shirts, and help from friends. They then recorded the EP \"Go America\".\n\nIn early 2003 the band received an email invitation from journalist Bob Slayer to perform in London. On January 16, 2003, Electric Eel Shock landed in London for five hastily-arranged gigs. The five shows rapidly become twelve gigs in ten days. The band used the London Underground as their only form of transport. After this, they returned to the US with Bob Slayer as their new manager.\n\nThe band spent the rest of 2003 between the US and Europe. Highlights included playing at both the SXSW and CMJ festivals in America, playing at Roskilde Festival in Denmark, headlining the Rockit Hong Kong Music Festival, and supporting the Canadian band Danko Jones on a 40-date European tour.\n\nAt the start of 2004 Electric Eel Shock went into the studio for the last of the \"Go\" sessions. Although these were still produced on a relatively low budget, and paid for by the band, this was the first time that they had used a studio and sound engineer as opposed to a practice room, kitchen or cupboard. The results, \"Go Europe!\" / \"Go USA!\", were licensed around the world and the band went on a promotional tour that took in 25 countries and 27 European festivals.\n\nThe band's European base camp for much of their touring in 2004 was the Suicide Motel in Utrecht, Netherlands, which Bob Slayer set up with Frank Suicide the guitarist of the Dutch band Wasted. Whilst spending time in the Netherlands they developed their friendship with Grammy-nominated producer Attie Bauw (who had worked with Judas Priest and the Scorpions) that they had met in Amsterdam during the Danko Jones tour. Electric Eel Shock were soon making plans with Attie Bauw for a new album. This would represent a move away from their garage rock roots. The aim was to catch all the energy and character of an Electric Eel Shock performance with a production that would sit alongside the early Black Sabbath albums that had inspired their creation. Assisting Attie in the studio was the band's live engineer, Tim Bray, who had become a fixture on tour with the band.\n\nThe band finished recording \"Beat Me\" at the end of December 2004, and returned to Japan for the first time in a long time, to do a few gigs.\n\nThroughout 2005 EES shows have become larger; touring in the US and Europe with the Bloodhound Gang, headlining festivals, and playing with the West Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra. Electric Eel Shock also made an appearance in the video clip for the Bloodhound Gang song \"Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss\". Their tours throughout Europe at the end of 2005 were completely sold out.\n\nIn March 2006, \"Beat Me\" was released in Japan on legendary metal label Roadrunner Records. The band toured Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the US in 2006 and played festivals in Europe.\n\nElectric Eel Shock released \"Transworld Ultra Rock\" on October 1, 2007. The album was the first release on their own label Double Peace Records. The band toured throughout Europe in support of the new album, later appearing as a support act on The Presidents of the United States of America's These Are the Good Times People tour. The album was released by P-Vine records on November 16, 2007 in Japan. It has been Electric Eel Shock's most successful album to date in terms of both press and sales.\n\nElectric Eel Shock joined Sellaband on 2 May 2008 to raise the funds to record their next album. On 25 June 2008 after 55 days the band successfully raised $50,000.\n\nThe press release describes Sugoi Indeed as an album full of classic rock hand-crafted in Japan. Attie Bauw, (Judas Priest, Scorpions) who produced the last two EES albums, was at the controls again, only this time he engineered the basic tracks and Electric Eel Shock took the production reins on the album themselves.\n\nThe album was licensed to several labels around the world and was released in October 2009.\n\nElectric Eel Shock has always had strong support from their fans and became one of the first bands without previous significant record label success to fully embrace crowdfunding. In 2004 they raised £10,000 from 100 fans (the Samurai 100) by offering them guestlist for life. Two years later they became the fastest band to raise the 50,000 budget through SellaBand. The album Sugoi Indeed, has been licensed to Universal Records in Japan and various independent labels around the world.\n\nEES and their UK based manager Bob Slayer became consultants on first SellaBand and later PledgeMusic. Having played an important role in establishing the viability and model for Crowd Funding in music they have now launched their own crowd funding site Fan-Bo.com. Launched in June 2012 Fan-Bo is a place where fans of Japanese pop culture can support independent bands, artists, writers and other creatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sex, Drugs, & Email\"\n\nFrom 2007 to 2011 Gian was unable to make all tours, when he was not available to tour EES used a number of stand in drummers: Gian is now back in the band permanently.\n\n"}

He was martyred in action in the Battle of Basantar in the Battlefield of Shakargarh during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 where his actions earned him his honour.\n\nArun Khetarpal was born in Pune, Maharashtra on 14 October 1950. His family belonged to Sargodha, Pakistan, and had migrated to India after partition as refugees. His father Lt Col (later Brigadier) M. L. Khetarpal was a Corps of Engineers officer serving in the Indian Army and his family traced a long history of military service. Attending The Lawrence School, Sanawar, he distinguished himself both as an able student and sportsman and was the school prefect. Khetarpal joined the National Defence Academy in June 1967. He belonged to Foxtrot Squadron where he was the Squadron Cadet Captain of the 38th Course. His NDA No was 7498/F/38. He subsequently went on to join the Indian Military Academy. In June 1971, Khetarpal was commissioned into the 17 Poona Horse.\n\nDuring the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, the 17 Poona Horse was assigned to the command of the 47th Infantry Brigade of the Indian Army. Through the duration of the conflict, the 47th Brigade saw action in the Shakargarh sector in the Battle of Basantar.\n\nAmong the tasks set for the 47th Brigade was to establish a bridgehead across the River Basantar. By 21:00 hours of 15 December, the brigade had captured its objectives. However, the place was extensively mined, which prevented the deployment of the tanks of the Poona Horse, and the engineers clearing the mines were halfway through their tasks when Indian troops at the bridge-head reported alarming enemy armour activity, asking for immediate armour support. It was at this critical juncture that the 17 Poona Horse decided to push through the mine-field. The regiment was able to link-up with the infantry at the bridge-head by first light the next day.\n\nAt 08:00 hours on 16 December, Pakistani armour launched the first of their counter-attacks under the cover of a smokescreen at the pivot of the 17th Poona Horse at Jarpal. At 08:00 hours, the Pakistani 13th Lancers, equipped with the then state-of-the-art US-made 50 ton Patton tanks, launched the first of their counter-attacks under the cover of a smokescreen at ‘B’ Squadron, The Poona Horse, at Jarpal. Its squadron commander urgently called for reinforcements. Arun Khetarpal, who was in ‘A’ squadron and was stationed close by with his Centurion tank troop, responded with alacrity, as did the rest of his regiment. The first counter-attack was decimated by accurate gunnery, coolness by Indian tank troop and individual tank commanders from the CO, Lt Col Hanut Singh down to its troop leader, Arun Khetarpal. The 13th Lancers desperately launched two more squadron-level counter-attacks and managed to achieve a breakthrough.\n\nKhetarpal rushed to meet the Pakistani armour and launched right into the Pakistani attack. With his troop, he was able to run over the enemy advance with his tanks. However, the commander of the second tank was killed in this attack. Alone in charge, Khetarpal continued his attack on the enemy strongholds. The enemy fought very bravely and did not retreat even after taking losses. Disappointed by his failure so far, he desperately attacked the incoming Pakistani troops and tanks, knocking out a Pakistani tank in the process. However Pakistani forces regrouped and counter-attacked. In the ensuing tank battle, Lt. Arun Khetarpal with his 2 remaining tanks fought off and destroyed 10 tanks before he was killed in action.\n\nThe skirmish however took its toll on the lieutenant as he was hit by enemy fire, but instead of abandoning the tank he fought on destroying one final tank before he was finally overwhelmed. However, his actions had denied a vital breakthrough for Pakistani forces and instead put the Indians in a stronger position in the Shakargarh bulge. His final words over the radio to a superior officer who had ordered him to abandon his burning tank were, \n\nKhetarpal's body and his tank, named \"Famagusta\", were later captured by Pakistan and eventually returned to the Indian military. This tank is on display back in India now.\n\nFor his conspicuous bravery and extreme gallantry in the face of fierce and unrelenting attacks and assaults by the enemy (the Pakistani military), Khetarpal was honoured with India's most-prestigious and highest-standard military medal for courage and gallantry, the Param Vir Chakra, posthumously.\n\nArun Khetarpal's body was cremated on 17 December near the Samba district and his ashes were sent to his family, who were unaware of his death until 26 December.\n\nThe crew of the \"Famagusta\" was Sowar Prayag Singh (the driver), Sowar Nand Singh (the radio operator), Sowar Nathu Singh (the gunner) and 2nd/Lt. Arun Khetarpal, the tank's commander. Nand Singh was first casualty (killed in action; KIA) when the tank was fatally hit in the final encounter with Pakistani Army Major Nasser's Patton tank. Arun was the second one to be killed after he sustained severe injuries when his tank was knocked out and eventually succumbed to his wounds. Both Prayag Singh and Nathu Singh were also badly wounded but survived and were captured by Pakistani troops who seized the \"Famagusta\". Both men were later given medical treatment by their Pakistani captors and survived to the end of the war when they were repatriated and retired from the Indian Army as honorary captains.\n\nThe Param Vir Chakra citation on the Official Indian Army Website reads as follows:\nKhetrapal is an iconic figure in the ethos of the Indian Army with prominent constructions being named after him. The parade ground at NDA is named Khetarpal Ground while the auditorium and one of the main gates bear his name at the IMA.\n\nArun Khetarpal's Centurion was called Famagusta Jx 202. It was restored after the war and is presently preserved in the Armoured Corps Centre and School in Ahmednagar.\n\nThe Commander of the Pakistan tank battalion is said to have met the Indian battalion commander after the battle and made enquiries about 2nd Lieutenant Khetarpal's tank since he was very impressed with the gallantry of this particular tank's commander.\n\nIn 2001, Brigadier M.L. Khetarpal – then 81 years old – felt a strong desire to visit his birthplace at Sargodha, now in Pakistan. At Lahore airport, Brigadier M.L. Khetarpal was met by Brigadier Khawja Mohammad Naser, who took it upon himself to be Brigadier M.L. Khetarpal host and guide. Brigadier Naser really went out of way to ensure that Brigadier M.L. Khetarpal had a satisfying and nostalgic visit to his old house in Sargodha. Upon his return to Lahore he was once again the guest of Brigadier Naser for three days.\n\nBrigadier M.L. Khetarpal was overwhelmed by the extreme kindness, deference, courtesy and respect bestowed upon him by Brigadier Naser and by all the members of his family and his many servants. However Brigadier Khetarpal felt that something was amiss but could not make out what it was. Was it the long silences that punctuated their animated conversation or was it the look of compassion in the eyes of the women in the family? He could not make out but was sure he was being treated as someone very special.\n\nFinally, on the last night before Brigadier M.L. Khetarpal's departure, Brigadier Naser said \n\nBrigadier M.L. Khetarpal was silent as he did not know how to react. To be enjoying the hospitality of the person who had killed his son was a confusing feeling. However being a soldier himself he genuinely admired the chivalry of an officer whose complete squadron was decimated by his son.\n\nBoth the Brigadiers retired for the night deep in thought. There are never any victors in war; both sides lose and it is the families that have to pay the price and suffer the most. As someone once said 'Wars are created by politicians, compounded by bureaucrats and fought by soldiers.'\n\nThe next day photographs were taken and Brigadier M.L. Khetarpal returned to Delhi. Later the photos reached Delhi along with a note from Brigadier Naser that said:\n\nAllu Sirish reprised Arun Khetarpal's character as Lt Chinmay in the 2017 Malayalam film .\n\n\n\n"}

She was the paternal grandmother of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. She is also the paternal great-great-great grandmother of Elizabeth II.\n\nPrincess Louise was the only daughter of Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg and his first wife Louise Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, daughter of Frederick Francis I, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (her namesake).\n\nOn 31 July 1817 in Gotha, sixteen-year-old Louise married her thirty-three-year-old kinsman Ernst III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, (later Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha), after he failed to win the hand of a Russian grand duchess. Louise was considered \"young, clever, and beautiful\".\n\nThey had two children: Ernst, who inherited his father's lands and titles, and Albert, who was later the husband of Queen Victoria.\n\nThe marriage was unhappy because of Ernst's infidelities and the couple separated in 1824. St. Wendel, in the Principality of Lichtenberg, was assigned as her new residence (it was an exclave of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha; see Sotnick on this period), and Louise was forced to leave her two sons behind. Biographer Lytton Strachey noted in 1921: \"The ducal court was not noted for the strictness of its morals; the Duke was a man of gallantry, and it was rumored that the Duchess followed her husband's example. There were scandals: one of the Court Chamberlains, a charming and cultivated man of Jewish extraction, was talked of; at last there was a separation, followed by a divorce.\"\n\nOn 31 March 1826 their marriage was officially dissolved. Seven months later, on 18 October 1826, Louise secretly married in St. Wendel her former lover, the Baron Alexander von Hanstein (later created Count of Pölzig and Beiersdorf). In her previous marriage, she had taken great interest in the social life of the principality and was revered as its \"Landesmutter\" (literally, \"mother of the region\"). Nevertheless, this happy life ended in February 1831, when her secret marriage to von Hanstein was discovered and she lost her children permanently.\n\nLouise died of cancer on 30 August 1831, when she was only 30 years old. Years after her death, Queen Victoria described Louise in an 1864 memorandum: \"The princess is described as having been very handsome, though very small; fair, with blue eyes; and Prince Albert is said to have been extremely like her\". Louise was reinterred from her initial burial site at Morizkirche to the ducal mausoleum at \"\" after it had been completed in 1859.\n\n"}

In fantasy tales, dragons were notorious for stealing children and feeding them to their babies. During the first part of the song, I sing 'Someone has taken a child.' The second part is about a cruel feudal lord. The third part is about 'electronic serfdom.'\" He also expressed belief that the computer has become a god in modern society. \"It is a small god with an electrical heart (...) It is time to rebel against it.\"\n\n\"Killing the Dragon\" introduces guitarist Doug Aldrich to the band. He had previously performed with Burning Rain and subsequently went on to join the band Whitesnake. Previous guitarist, Craig Goldy, co-wrote some of the songs before leaving the band. He returned for 2004's \"Master of the Moon\". It is their final album with bassist Jimmy Bain.\n\nThe song \"Push\" was a hit and had a music video that featured Tenacious D performing a humorous cover of Ronnie James Dio's biggest song from his time with Black Sabbath, \"Heaven and Hell\". Dio approaches them to tell them that he will pay them to play Tenacious D music. Apparently, according to an interview with Dio in 2005, during filming of this music video, Ronnie James Dio became friends with Tenacious D frontman Jack Black, who told Dio about his plans to make a Tenacious D film and asked him to perform in the film if anything became of it. In 2005, Dio received a letter from Black informing him that production of the film was starting and requested that he play himself. This film is \"Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny\". The video was directed by Bill Schacht (who has directed other videos for Alice Cooper, Amon Amarth, Sister Sin, Yngwie Malmsteen, Saxon, etc.) for Aestheticom. The video was listed as No. 54 most metal moment of all time on a VH1 100 Most Metal Moments show, hosted by Eddie Trunk.\n\nThe song Throw Away Children from this album was slated to appear in a sequel project to Hear 'n Aid but was aborted due to various reasons.\n\nAll lyrics by Ronnie James Dio, music as stated. The \"Limited Tour Edition\" came in a slipcase with poster and added two bonus tracks. These bonus tracks are Ronnie James Dio performing live with Deep Purple and first appeared on Deep Purple's 2001 album \"Live at the Rotterdam Ahoy\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in the county of Wągrowiec (Polish \"Powiat Wągrowiecki\") in the western-central territorial division of the Greater Poland Voivodship.\n\n\"The Book of Benefices\" (\"Liber beneficiorum\") of the Archbishops of Gniezno contains descriptions of the history of the areas of Wapno, Podolin, Rusiec and Srebrna Góra.\n\nIn the beginning of the 16th century, Srebrna Góra included a parish church under the appellation of Saint Nicholas; a parsonage; and while it still was a town, it was the most populated place in the area.\nIn the end of 18th century Srebrna Góra belonged to Józef Radzimiński – a land judge of Gniezno.\nSince the 19th century, it has been owned by the Wilkoński family, and then by the Moszczeński family.\nSrebrna Góra was previously ascribed to the county of Kcyń. After the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, it was moved to the county Wągrowiec.\n\nIn the times of the Duchy of Warsaw (1807-1812), Srebrna Góra belonged to the capital city of Poznań.\nAfter 1815, the county of Wągrowiec (\"Powiat Wągrowiec\") was re-established, but some parts of land were moved out of it for the sake of other Polish counties (\"powiats)\".\nNew administrational changes were applied in 1887, when the county of Żnin was created, and Rusiec and Srebrna Góra were associated with it.\n\nSrebrna Góra sent only one soldier for the Thirteen Years' War.\n\nThere is a palace complex in Srebrna Góra dating to the end of the 17th century, most likely built shortly after 1792. The palace, together with two ground-floor annexes of four-column porticos, is situated on a hill in front of the parish church. The buildings of the complex surround a large yard preceded by a gate. The date written on the gate – 1799 – may refer to the palace annexes, not the palace itself. The oriented palace is a nine-axial, ground-floor building with a classical order portico. The two pairs of protruded columns are of considerably slim proportions, and have simplified Ionic capitals. The high, hip-and-valley roof is covered with tiles. The whole complex is surrounded by a wall finished with a balustrade assembly.\n\nInside, a large hall leads to the main parlour, where a row connects the parlour and rooms situated to the right and left. Located behind the palace, there are five ponds situated on a park landscape. Today, the palace is used as a \"House of Social Aid\".\n\nNear the palace complex, there is a parish church under the appellation of Saint Nicholas that was built in 1848–1849. The original church was burnt in a fire, but was rebuilt with the preservation of late classical and eclectic features. The meetings of the \"Catholic Society of Polish Workers\" may have been held in the parish parlour of the church. The Society was active in Srebrna Góra during World War I and the interwar period.\n"}

A prequel was released one year later entitled \"\". A remake, \"Fear Effect Reinvented\", was announced on August 21, 2017.\n\n\"Fear Effect\" features gameplay with unshaded characters textured to resemble cel-shading, notably being one of the very first games to utilize the technique. Rather than using pre-rendered 2D backgrounds, the environments are composed of streaming or looping full-motion video. As a consequence, the game is composed of four discs. There are also puzzles interspersed between action sequences, similar to other games of the survival horror genre.\n\nThe player controls one of three mercenaries (either Hana, Deke, or Glas) through areas filled with human and non-human enemies. The game controls are similar to traditional survival horror tank controls, with an exception being that the characters can run and shoot simultaneously. When wielding two guns (one in each hand), they are also able to shoot multiple enemies at the same time. Another feature is the ability to duck and roll; while facing a number of the armed foes, the player can roll a short distance and avoid taking enemy fire.\n\nThe game's title refers to the player's life bar, a meter which resembles a pulsing EKG. When the player is damaged, the green line of the EKG will pulse faster and turn red. It is possible to 'regain' health by performing acts that will calm that character's heart rate. These include solving a puzzle or sneaking behind a guard to perform a stealth kill. Both will be rewarded with a health boost that brings the meter back to green.\n\nWhen Wee Ming, the daughter of a powerful Hong Kong Triad boss disappears, a trio of mercenaries search for her in the city. They have not been hired to find her, but they intend to kidnap the girl before her father's men locate her and hold her for ransom. Wee Ming has vanished into the fictional Shan Xi protectorate; Hana Tsu-Vachel, the lead character and femme fatale of the group, used to work in a brothel somewhere in that region.\n\nHana arrives in Hong Kong accompanied by her partners, Royce Glas and Jacob \"Deke\" DeCourt. What begins as a simple snatch and grab turns into a fiasco: The father of the runaway, Mr. Lam, attributes his fortune and power to a pact he made with demons long ago. Wee Ming, who is a paper doll given life, has been scheduled to serve as a sacrifice to Yim Lau Wong, the mythical \"King of Hell\". Hana's contact inside Mr. Lam's organization, Jin, is discovered, tortured, and left to die with a bomb strapped to his chest. Hana frees him, but he is killed shortly after. Meanwhile, Glas is attacked by a VTOL jet and forced to flee into Mr. Lam's building. After avenging Jin, Hana is captured and beaten by Mr. Lam and his thugs. Glas is able to rescue Hana, and the duo make their escape where they meet Deke in front of the hotel they are staying at. While listening to Jin's last message for Hana, the trio are forced off a bridge but are able to swim to a junk. While sailing down a river, Deke spots Wee Ming amongst a burning village. Deke and Glas give chase while Hana gets dressed, but all three are separated by the undead villagers. \n\nThey stumble upon a military train where the hostile soldiers shoot anyone on sight for fear of the villagers. Hana and Deke wreck the train trying to steal it, but Glas is able to find a jeep with Wee Ming sitting inside. She asks to be taken to a Madam Chen's restaurant, which doubles as a brothel, hoping to find answers about her existence. When Glas is caught sneaking in the brothel, Mr. Lam surprises him, cutting off his left arm. At the same time, Deke is murdered while trying to infiltrate the brothel from upstairs. Hana sneaks in by dressing up like one of the prostitutes, where she runs into Wee Ming again after she had been dragged off by Madam Chen, who is working for Mr. Lam. Wee Ming's powers activate, after being splashed with Deke's blood, transforming the working girls and Madam Chen's thugs into demons.\n\nThe one-armed Glas reawakens in a meat locker, surprised to find he is still alive; he surmises that Mr. Lam must be planning a slow death for him. Wee Ming arrives and tries her best aid him. When Hana storms in to confront her former boss, Madam Chen, she learns that Chen is actually a demon in disguise. In the ensuing fight, Chen and her minions are killed, but Mr. Lam disappears with his daughter into a portal to Hell. Determined to save Wee Ming from whatever fate Mr. Lam has in store for her, Hana follows them into the portal, with Glas reawakening, and frees himself to give chase.\n\nIn a surreal journey through Hell, Hana meets the Black and White Guards of Impermanence who give her cryptic messages about her fate. Glas encounters the reanimated corpse of Deke, who is being tortured for the many murders he has committed. Deke takes on a grotesque demonic form and attacks Glas. After he is victorious, Glas promises to avenge Deke. Meanwhile, Hana confronts Yim Lau Wong, who explains that Hell has become overburdened with the souls of the guilty. Once Wee Ming is returned to the netherworld, Yim Lau Wong will be able to expand the reaches of Hell and consume Earth. Hana was chosen to look after Wee Ming because Yim Lau Wong desired someone \"ruthless\" to be her guardian.\n\nGlas reappears and tries to kill Wee Ming, believing her to be the root of the chaos. During the tense standoff between Hana and Glas, the player is given a choice over which of them should die. This decision will determine the final boss as well as the subsequent ending. On the \"Hard\" difficulty setting, a third option will become available: spare the lives of both Glas and Hana. In this ending, the pair emerge from the smoldering wreckage of the brothel, where they find a befuddled Deke sitting on a toilet. Deke has no memory of being killed, believing he has taken a bump to the head, and asks how they made out on the \"deal\". As he hoists himself out of the pit, Glas is stunned to realize that his left arm has been completely restored. The three partners walk off into the sunrise to continue their exploits.\n\n\"Fear Effect\" received generally positive review from critics. \"Edge\" praised the game's tight script and distinctive graphics, but criticized its unbalanced gameplay and clumsy control system, stating that they \"make the boss encounters absurdly difficult\". The magazine concluded that, \"In such a beautiful cinematic game, featuring clever plotting and scripting, such deficiencies are even more offensive.\"\n\nBlake Fischer reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"One of the most exciting and innovative adventures to show up on PlayStation, dragged down only slightly by a few sticky gameplay issues.\"\n\nA prequel titled \"\" was released in 2001 for the PlayStation. In 2016, \"Fear Effect Sedna\" was announced after French studio Sushee pitched the idea to Square Enix. \nIn August 2017, Square Enix announced a remake of \"Fear Effect\" titled \"Fear Effect Reinvented\". \"Reinvented\" is being developed by MegaPixel Studio S.A. and published by Square Enix for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\n"}

Wahlroos's nickname \"Nalle\", which means \"\"teddy bear\"\" in Finnish and Swedish, derives from his first name Björn, which means \"bear\" in Swedish.\n\nHis father Bror \"Bunta\" Wahlroos held a high position in the Ministry of Trade and Industry. His mother is a long-time friend of Martti Ahtisaari, president of Finland (1994–2000) and they both worked in Africa.\n\nIn terms of political economy viewpoint, Björn Wahlroos is known as a defender of laissez-faire economics, a fighter against Keynesian economics. He owns a mansion in Salo in Finland and a second mansion in Nice in France in addition an apartment in Stockholm.\n\nAfter graduation from gymnasium in 1971 Björn Wahlroos studied at the Hanken School of Economics in Helsinki. He graduated as a M.Sc. in 1975 and got his D.Sc. in 1979. The following years were spent in academia; as an acting professor of economics at the Hanken School of Economics in Helsinki and as a visiting professor at Brown University and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, Illinois, United States.\n\nIn 1985 Wahlroos switched career to banking, joining the executive board of Union Bank of Finland (Suomen Yhdyspankki). In 1988 he was appointed Executive vice president and Head of Investment Banking & Treasury at the Union Bank of Finland. Together with half a dozen of his colleagues Wahlroos bought out the investment banking operations of UBF in 1992 and started the partnership Mandatum & Co, which soon became the leading advisor of mergers and acquisitions in Scandinavia. Through a merger with Interbank in 1998 Mandatum was listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange.\n\nIn 2000 Wahlroos merged his banking group into Sampo-Leonia and took over as President and CEO of the combined company, also becoming its biggest private shareholder. In 2009 Wahlroos resigned as CEO and was elected Chairman of Sampo plc, holding company of Sampo Group, which by then had become the biggest insurer in Northern Europe and also the main shareholder of Nordea, the region's largest bank. In March 2011 he was elected as the Chairman of Nordea.\n\nWahlroos is also Chairman of the Board of UPM-Kymmene, the pulp and paper manufacturer.\n\nWhile a student, Wahlroos was involved in left-wing politics. He was a member of Finlands Svenska Skolungdomsförbundet in 1969–1973 and communist revolutionary student association Sosialistiset taloustieteen opiskelijat in 1971–1973. He left extreme leftist politics in 1973. After this he has withdrawn from active party politics although he is a paying member of the Swedish People's Party. He has nevertheless given public comments that give an indication of his thoughts.\n\nIn 2001, he declared himself in favour of a citizen's income in Finland. \"Basic security, in my mind, must never be threatened because it is an important part of human modern society\", Wahlroos said in the Finnish newspaper Uutispäivä Demari, clearing way to negative income tax thinking. In March 2009 Wahlroos predicted that the economic recession would not endure for long, because the market corrects itself quickly. In March 2010, in an interview in Image magazine, he spoke of the need to cut Finnish development aid because \"we have 50 years of money thrown into a bottomless well\". In addition, he has criticized giving grants to university students because it, according to Wahlroos, \"supports idleness\", and regards agricultural and forestry research expenditures as excessive. In June 2010 Wahlroos told the Financial Times that Europe will have to reconsider the future of the Social market economy model, because people cannot be taxed in the future in the current fashion, and poverty and broken families are unsustainable. Wahlroos also believes that agricultural subsidies should be abolished throughout the world: \"It is absurd that Finland is with one hand supporting the Zambian agribusiness and the other the EU common agricultural policy. (...) ...giving to developing countries at the same time ... when the EU is to abolish agricultural subsidies and open tariff barriers on agricultural products.\" At the same time he receives remarkable agricultural subsidies himself.\n\nIn 2015 Wahlroos published a book defending his laissez-faire economics viewpoint, \"De tio sämsta ekonomiska teorierna. Från Keynes till Piketty\" (The ten worst economic theories; From Keynes to Piketty). In the book he argues, for instance, that stable economic development is difficult to implement in a democratic social system.\n\nWahlroos is a member of Libera, a foundation organized under Mont Pelerin Society.\n\nIn the Finnish Defence Forces, Wahlroos holds the rank of major in the reserves.\n\nWahlroos has been married once and has two adult children from that marriage, Thomas and Nina. His son Thomas Wahlroos is well known in the European professional poker circuit and has won nearly 1.5 million dollars from tournament poker.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2185764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2185764", "title": "East Indiaman", "text": "East Indiaman\n\nEast Indiaman was a general name for any sailing ship operating under charter or licence to any of the East India trading companies of the major European trading powers of the 17th through the 19th centuries. The term is used to refer to vessels belonging to the Austrian, Danish, Dutch, English, French, Portuguese, or Swedish companies.\n\nSome of the East Indiamen chartered by the British East India Company were known as \"tea clippers\".\n\nIn Britain, the Honourable East India Company held a monopoly granted to it by Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1600 for all English trade between the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn, which was progressively restricted during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, until the monopoly was lost in 1834. English (later British) East Indiamen usually ran between England, the Cape of Good Hope and India, where their primary destinations were the ports of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. The Indiamen often continued on to China before returning to England via the Cape of Good Hope and Saint Helena. When the company lost its monopoly, the ships of this design were sold off. A smaller, faster ship known as a Blackwall Frigate was built for the trade as the need to carry heavy armaments declined.\n\n\"East Indiaman\" was a general name for any sailing ship operating under charter or licence to any of the East India Companies of the major European trading powers of the 17th through the 19th centuries. These include the Danish, Dutch, English, French, Portuguese and Swedish East India companies.\n\nEast Indiamen carried both passengers and goods, and were armed to defend themselves against pirates. Initially, the East Indiamen were built to carry as much cargo as possible, rather than for speed of sailing. The East India company had a monopoly on trade with India and China, supporting this design.\n\nEast Indiamen were the largest merchant ships regularly built during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, generally measuring between 1100 and 1400 tons burthen (bm). Two of the largest were the \"Earl of Mansfield\" and \"Lascelles\" being built at Deptford in 1795. The Royal Navy purchased both, converted them to 56-gun fourth rates, and renamed them \"Weymouth\" and \"Madras\" respectively. They measured 1426 tons (bm) on dimensions of approximately 175 feet overall length of hull, 144 feet keel, 43 feet beam, 17 feet draft.\n\nIn England, Queen Elizabeth I granted an exclusive right to the trade to the East India Company in 1600. This monopoly lasted until 1834. The company grew to encompass more than the trade between England and India, but the ships described in this article are the type used in the 17th to the early 19th centuries to carry the trade.\n\nDuring the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars they were often painted to resemble warships; an attacker could not be sure if gunports were real or merely paint, and some Indiamen carried sizable armaments. The Royal Navy acquired several East Indiamen, turning them into fourth rates (e.g., HMS \"Weymouth\" and HMS \"Madras\", described above), maintaining the confusion for military ships seeking merchant ships as prizes of war. In some cases the East Indiamen successfully fought off attacks by the French. One of the most celebrated of these incidents occurred in 1804, when a fleet of East Indiamen and other merchant vessels under Commodore Nathaniel Dance successfully fought off a marauding squadron commanded by Admiral Linois in the Indian Ocean in the Battle of Pulo Aura.\n\nDue to the need to carry heavy cannon, the hull of the East Indiamen – in common with most warships of the time – was much wider at the waterline than at the upper deck, so that guns carried on the upper deck were closer to the centre-line to aid stability. This is known as tumblehome. The ships normally had two complete decks for accommodation within the hull and a raised poop deck. The poop deck and the deck below it were lit with square-windowed galleries at the stern. To support the weight of the galleries, the hull lines towards the stern were full. Later ships built without this feature tended to sail faster, which put the East Indiamen at a commercial disadvantage once the need for heavy armament passed.\n\nAccording to historian Fernand Braudel, some of the finest and largest Indiamen of the late 18th and early 19th centuries were built in India, making use of Indian shipbuilding techniques and crewed by Indians, their hulls of Indian teak being especially suitable for local waters. These ships were used for the China run. Until the coming of steamships, these Indian-built ships were relied upon almost exclusively by the British in the eastern seas. None sailed to Europe and they were banned from English ports. Many hundreds of Indian-built Indiamen were built for the British, along with other ships, including warships. Notable among them were \"Surat Castle\" (1791), a 1,000-ton (bm) ship with a crew of 150, \"Lowjee Family\", of 800 tons (bm) and a crew of 125, and \"Shampinder\" (1802), of 1,300 tons (bm).\n\nAnother significant East Indiaman in this period was the 1176-ton (bm) \"Warley\" that John Perry built at his Blackwall Yard in 1788, and which the Royal Navy bought in 1795 and renamed . In 1803 she was employed as a transport to establish a settlement at Port Phillip in Australia, later shifted to the site of current-day Hobart, Tasmania by an accompanying ship, the \"Ocean\". French forces captured \"Calcutta\" in 1805 off the Isles of Scilly. She grounded at the Battle of the Basque Roads in 1809, and was burned by a British boarding party after her French crew had abandoned her.\n\nThe 1200-ton (bm) \"Arniston\" was likewise employed by the Royal Navy as a troop transport between England and Ceylon. In 1815, she was wrecked near Cape Agulhas with the loss of 372 lives after a navigation error that was caused by inaccurate dead reckoning and the lack of a marine chronometer with which to calculate her longitude.\n\nWith the progressive restriction of the monopoly of the British East India Company the desire to build such large armed ships for commercial use waned, and during the late 1830s a smaller, faster ship known as a Blackwall Frigate was built for the premium end of the India and China trades. The last of the East Indiamen was reputed to be the \"Java\" (1813–1939) that became a coal hulk, then was broken up.\n\nThe Battle of Pulo Aura is featured in Patrick O'Brian's novel \"HMS Surprise\", with French Admiral Linois in pursuit of a large fleet of East Indiamen. In the novel, HMS \"Surprise\" under Captain Aubrey organizes the merchantmen to defeat Linois and his squadron. In history, all the ships that defeated the French squadron were merchantmen.\n\nIn the Aubrey-Maturin series, East Indiamen are involved in many of the novels, including the second set in the Peace of Amiens, where some of the sailors took positions on East Indiamen. In other of the novels, Aubrey intercepts enemy vessels that interfere with the merchant ships, earning their gratitude.\n\nThe 2018 video game Return of the Obra Dinn features an East Indiaman as the fictional vessel, with gameplay requiring players to thoroughly explore a 3D model of the ship and observe its crew's activities.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2185782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2185782", "title": "Wang Qishan", "text": "Wang Qishan\n\nWang Qishan (; ; born 19 July 1948) is a Chinese politician, and the current Vice President of the People's Republic of China. Wang is one of the leading figures behind China's foreign affairs, along with Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang. Between 2012 and 2017, Wang had served as the Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Communist Party's anti-corruption body, and a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's highest decision making body. He was instrumental in carrying out General Secretary Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign since 2013.\n\nWang gained prominence in China's financial sector in the late 1980s. In 1994, Wang became the Governor of the China Construction Bank. Wang then successively served in three regional roles: Vice-Governor of Guangdong, Party Secretary of Hainan, and Mayor of Beijing. Wang then served as Vice-Premier in charge of finance and commercial affairs under premier Wen Jiabao from March 2008 to March 2013, during which he also gained a seat on the party's Politburo. Currently Wang is considered to be among Xi Jinping's closest political allies.\n\nWang Qishan was born in Qingdao, Shandong, but his ancestral hometown is considered Tianzhen, Shanxi. After graduating high school, Wang worked as a sent-down youth in the countryside, performing manual labour with peasants on a commune in the revolutionary heartland of Yan'an, where he met and befriended Xi Jinping. In 1973, Wang was admitted as a \"Worker-Peasant-Soldier student\" at Northwest University in Xi'an, where he studied history and graduated in 1976.\n\nWang met Yao Mingshan (), the daughter of Yao Yilin, in Yan'an and the two later wed.\n\nAfter graduation, Wang worked in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, researching late imperial Chinese history (1800s onwards) and Republican era (1912-1949) history.\n\nIn 1982, Yao Yilin became an alternate member of the Central Secretariat, and Wang was elevated to the Secretariat's office on rural policy research. This marked the beginning of Wang's political career.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1988, Wang worked in various posts in policy research. In 1988, Wang was transferred to become the chief executive of the Agricultural Investment Trust of China. A year later he became Vice Governor at China Construction Bank. Wang became Governor of the China Construction Bank in 1994 and served until 1997. During this time, Wang facilitated cooperation with U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley, and was instrumental in the founding of China's first investment bank, the China International Capital Corp (CICC), and served as its first executive Chairman.\n\nIn 1997, Wang was transferred to Guangdong to become its Executive Vice Governor, one of the highest posts in the provincial government. At the height of the Asian Financial Crisis, Wang assisted then Guangdong Party Secretary Li Changchun in managing non-performing loans of various state owned enterprises in the province. Since then, Wang developed a reputation for being a \"financial specialist\" in Premier Zhu Rongji's cabinet. Next, Wang served as the General Office chief of the State Economic Structural Reform Commission ().\n\nWang took over from disgraced Beijing mayor Meng Xuenong when SARS struck the city in spring 2003, at which time he had only served as the Party Secretary in Hainan for five months. After arriving in Beijing, Wang took an open approach to the release of information about SARS to the public. In contrast to the lack of transparency during the administration of his predecessor, Wang called for a daily press release on the latest information about SARS.\n\nWang was confirmed as Mayor of Beijing in early 2004. As mayor, Wang also served as the executive chair of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG). In March 2005, during a local radio show, Wang apologized on air to the Beijing public for an ongoing natural gas supply shortage in the city. The action won praise in the media and was said to have decreased the perceived distance between government officials and the public. Wang was known to be frank and responsible.\n\nIn 2007, he became a member of the 17th Central Committee and the 17th Politburo of the Communist Party of China; in 2008, he was named a Vice Premier of the State Council, in charge of finance and commerce. In 2009, Wang was appointed by President Hu Jintao as his special representative to chair the Economic Track of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue for the Chinese side.\n\nWang was named as one of the most influential people in the world in the 2009 Time 100 list.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, Wang was seen by observers as a rising political star, with a diverse political pedigree spanning the realms of high finance, regional government, and policy development and execution. Wang ultimately entered the ranks of the Politburo Standing Committee, considered the pinnacle of power in China, at the 18th Party Congress, taking on the job of the Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's top anti-graft body. Xi Jinping became General Secretary of the Communist Party of China at the same Congress. The appointment was unexpected given Wang's experience in the economic realm; he was seen as a more likely candidate for executive Vice-Premier. The decision to hand Wang the disciplinary portfolio seemed to have come as a surprise even to Wang himself: in video footage of a leaked CCDI conference after taking the helm of the body, Wang said of the decision, \"you can go look at media reports before the 18th Congress, who knew Wang Qishan was going to become secretary of the CCDI?... That's how things work. You do what the party tells you to do.\"\n\nWang's assuming the leading anti-corruption post was believed to be at least partly owing to his relationship with Xi Jinping. Wang was friends with Xi beginning in their youth, they shared a bunk when they were both performing manual labour in Shaanxi province during the Cultural Revolution, and Wang lent Xi books related to economics; Wang also had dealings with Xi during the latter's time as a regional official in Fujian.\n\nBeginning in late 2012, Wang emerged as the public face of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign, the most far-reaching campaign of its sort since the founding of the Communist-ruled state in 1949. He also became the Leader of the Central Leading Group for Inspection Work, responsible for dispatching teams to the provinces and state-owned enterprises with the goal of rooting out corruption. Following the 18th Party Congress, Wang was often considered the second most powerful man in China, second only to Xi, the Party General Secretary (paramount leader).\n\nWang became a favourite of the media. In October 2015, the CCDI under Wang's leadership released a new and complete set of regulations on party disciplinary procedures and rules on party member conduct, a document aimed at institutionalizing the party's ability to discipline its members and reduce corruption. Additionally, Wang introduced for the first time a set of disciplinary procedures for party disciplinary officials themselves. Wang's anti-corruption work gained him accolades within the party leadership, with many calling for an extension of his term at the 19th Party Congress in 2017. Since the 16th Party Congress, the rule of \"seven-up, eight-down\" had been informally applied for every Politburo Standing Committee member (i.e., if a Standing Committee member is 68 at a time of the Congress, he must step down, but if he is 67, he can continue to hold a seat). If Wang were to continue his term past 2017, he would break this convention. Wang himself was reluctant to this possibility. During a press conference, Wang stated, \"if I were a department-level chief, I would be long retired. Even if I were a deputy minister or a minister, I would be retired by now.\"\n\nChina watchers expect Wang to hold another high position during Xi Jinping's second term of Party General Secretary, owing to the fact that his name was not mentioned among those senior party leaders slated for retirement (). Wang has also accompanied Xi on private meetings with the US ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, in recent weeks. In 17 March 2018, he became the Vice President of China.\n\nWang is married to Yao Mingshan, daughter of former first Vice Premier of China Yao Yilin; Wang does not have children. He is sometimes considered a \"princeling\" through his marriage.\n\nYao Mingshan's sister is Yao Mingduan, the husband of Yao Mingduan is Meng Xuenong. Meng Xuenong is the former Mayor of Beijing, former Governor of Shanxi, and former member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.\n\nU.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson said that Wang is \"decisive and inquisitive\" and \"an avid historian, enjoys philosophical debates and has a wicked sense of humor\". Paulson writes, \"He is a Chinese patriot, but he understands the U.S. and knows that each of our two countries benefits from the other's economic success. And he is bold — he takes on challenges, does things that have never been done before and succeeds. Wang managed the largest bankruptcy restructuring in China's history in 1998 and thereby prevented a banking crisis that could have crippled the country's growth.\"\n\nWang is a fan of the American television show \"House of Cards\", and frequently alluded to the show during anti-corruption conferences; Wang said he was especially fascinated by the role of the party whip. He also said he watched some Korean dramas. Wang said, \"Korea dramas are ahead of us, yet the core and soul of Korean dramas [represents] an advancement from [art forms seen] in traditional Chinese culture.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2185791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2185791", "title": "Multilateral Agreement on Investment", "text": "Multilateral Agreement on Investment\n\nThe Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) was a draft agreement negotiated in secret between members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) between 1995 and 1998. It sought to establish a new body of universal investment laws that would grant corporations unconditional rights to engage in financial operations around the world, without any regard to national laws and citizens' rights. The draft gave corporations a right to sue governments if national health, labor or environment legislation threatened their interests. When its draft became public in 1997, it drew widespread criticism from civil society groups and developing countries, particularly over the possibility that the agreement would make it difficult to regulate foreign investors. After an intense global campaign was waged against the MAI by the treaty's critics, the host nation France announced in October 1998 that it would not support the agreement, effectively preventing its adoption due to the OECD's consensus procedures.\n\nInternational direct investment has been taking place in various forms and to different degrees for over a century. Attempts to establish a framework for the protection of foreign investments dates back to the 1920s, most notably negotiating a League of Nations draft convention. Starting from the second half of the twentieth century, the investment protection was developed through the bilateral investment treaties (BIT), which are signed between two countries and which state the desired conditions under which investment can take place between them. The first BIT, between West Germany and Pakistan, was signed in 1959 and their numbers have grown steadily since then, although research suggests that BITs do little to increase foreign investment. In 1965, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) was established in the framework of the United Nations, and in 1967, the OECD prepared the Draft Convention on the Protection of Foreign Property although this was not adopted.\n\nThe number of bilateral investment agreements increased rapidly during the 1990s as countries and investors sought more regulation for security, certainty and mobility for their investments after it became clear that the Uruguay Round's Agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMS), Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) addressed only part of investment-related concerns and did not provide enough security for investors nor strong controls on host governments to regulate multinational corporations. In addition to these instruments, in 1992 the World Bank adopted Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment. In 1994 the Energy Charter Treaty provided an example of a multilateral investment agreement, though limited to the energy sector.\n\nNoam Chomsky argued that the OECD, as an organization made up solely of rich countries, was more susceptible to direct influence by transnational corporate forces than alternative fora with more universal membership such as United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nWhile authorizing the negotiations, the OECD Ministerial Council aimed to reach a \"broad multilateral framework for international investment with high standards for the liberalization of investment regimes and investment protection and with effective dispute-settlement procedures\". The aim was to create more consistent, secure and stable investment conditions and to regulate investment in a more uniform, transparent and enforceable manner. Although the agreement was to be negotiated between the member states, the intention was to have an open agreement to which non-OECD members could accede on a negotiated basis.\n\nAccording to MAI supporter Sergio Marchi, who was Canada's Minister of International Trade at the time, one of the main purposes of the agreement was to eliminate the \"patchwork\" of investment rules enshrined in the then-1300+ bilateral investment treaties. Contrary to many critics, he argued that the MAI would help prevent a \"race to the bottom\" that would undermine high standards of Canadian regulation. More specifically, the agreement would:\n\n\nThe MAI was supported by both the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD (BIAC) and the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD (TUAC). While BIAC was interested in stable and consistent treatment of investment, TUAC was interested on setting standards on employment and industrial relations.\n\nThe negotiations on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment were formally launched by the OECD's Ministerial Council in May 1995 and they commenced in September 1995. The negotiations were carried out by a high-level negotiating group consisting of officials from the OECD member states, but working outside the OECD committee structure consulting with the non-member countries. The chairperson of the negotiating group was Frans Engering (Netherlands) and vice-chairpersons were Al Larson (United States) and A. Saiki (Japan). The target deadline to finish the negotiations, set by the OECD Ministerial Council, was mid-1997.\n\nThere was little public awareness of the details of MAI negotiations until a draft of the agreement was leaked in March 1997. The leaked material prompted criticism from different NGOs globally. As a result, the negotiations failed in 1998 when first France and then other countries successively withdrew after pressure from a global movement of NGOs, citizens' groups and a number of governments of developing countries. In April 1998, the negotiations were formally suspended for six months. On 3 December 1998, the OECD announced that \"negotiations on the MAI are no longer taking place\".\n\nMultinational corporations (MNCs) enjoy enormous structural and resource advantages over employees and citizens. Yet when the MNCs and major governments tried to expand those advantages through the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), they were stymied by a global alliance of activists. MAI opponents made heavy use of electronic mail and the World Wide Web in raising the alert, sharing information and coordinating actions. They worked collaboratively, flexibly and imaginatively towards their goals while MNCs and governments were working secretively and within more traditional hierarchical models. \n\nThe international protests against the MAI were the first example of such mass-activism to deploy the Internet. The internet was central both in gathering information and in promulgating critical materials among members of a vast worldwide network. The movement's main argument was that the most influential mass media and politicians had vested interests in the MAI. Even their opponents ruefully acknowledged that the activists possessed highly qualified, eloquent analysts and leaders—and were able to use the new internet technology to devastating effect. French MEP Catherine Lalumière stated: \"These organisations have refined and diffused to all countries an anti-MAI position which is now expressed in similar terms throughout the diverse countries of the OECD.\"\n\nAccording to Theodore H. Cohn in \"Global Political Economy Theory and Practice\" (2005), \"[t]he most effective opposition to the MAI was launched by a wide-ranging coalition of civil society NGOs. These NGOs argued that the MAI would threaten protection of human rights, labor and environmental standards, and least developed countries. A particular concern was that the MAI would result in a \"race to the bottom\" among countries willing to lower their labor and environmental standards to attract foreign investment. The origin of organised opposition was traced by Katia Tieleman in her 2000 UN case study:\n\nUsing a variety of websites, NGOs mobilized a strong and diverse opposition composed of human rights groups, labor and environmental groups, and consumer advocates.\n\nMAI opponents pointed to a perceived threat to national sovereignty. and democracy and argued that it would involve participating nations in a \"race to the bottom\" in environmental and labor standards. The MAI prompted criticism that it appeared to establish a new body of universal investment laws to guarantee corporations excessive powers to buy, sell and undertake financial operations all over the world, severely diluting national laws, e.g., on environmental protection, regulation of labour standards and human rights established in developed countries. By their arguments, the draft proposed a North American Free Trade Agreement-style investor-state dispute settlement tribunal in which corporations could sue governments if legislation (e.g., for national health, labor or environment), threatened their interests or were considered to expropriate actual or potential assets and/or profits.\n\nMark Vallianatos, of Friends of the Earth, argued that:\n\n\nContributors to the MAI-NOT newsgroup, including Maude Barlow, mounted a campaign with the active backing of the Council of Canadians which had earlier opposed the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the USA, Canada and Mexico.\n\nIn Montreal, on May 25, 1998, the Montreal Conference on Globalized Economies was nonviolently blockaded for five hours by hundreds of activists in what was called Operation SalAMI, based on the French acronym of the proposed agreement, AMI, referring not only the sausage, but also to a \"dirty friend\". Operation SalAMI demanded that Canada withdraw from the negotiations on the MAI. The presence of one key MAI player, Donald Johnston (General Secretary of the OECD) at the conference helped to focus the action, one of the three most important anti-MAI events in the world. These mobilizations on an international scale actually led to the shelving of the agreement. The award-winning documentary \"Pressure Point: Inside the Montreal Blockade\" recorded the drama of this action where 100 people were arrested.\n\nA strong campaign was led by Lori Wallach of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, and a coordinated network (\"50 Years is Enough') including Friends of the Earth, the Alliance for Democracy, Witness for Peace, the Sierra Club, the Preamble Center, the Democratic Socialists of America and other groups.\n\nIn November 1997, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio programme \"Background Briefing\" presented the Quiet Debate—a report about the silence of the Australian government and media on an issue which was arousing fierce controversy in the United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. However, Australian activists, including members of Pauline Hanson's One Nation were already studying the leaked MAI draft and corresponding with the Canadian email discussion group MAI-NOT while deciding how to organise a national campaign to link with those of other countries. In January 1998 a national \"STOP MAI\" coalition was formed to research issues, lobby parliamentarians and conduct public meetings. In November 1998, prior to the opening of OECD negotiations in Paris, the coalition delivered to the meeting's chairman and to the Australian prime minister a protest letter endorsed by over 500 organisations and individuals. The letter was reinforced by a prominent advertisement in \"The Australian\" newspaper on 11 November\n\nFrance's withdrawal followed consideration of a report on the negotiations drawn up by a French MEP, Catherine Lalumière. After receiving this report, prime minister Lionel Jospin addressed the Assemblée Nationale on 10 October 1998 and announced his decision to withdraw. He said the Lalumière Report had identified a number of fundamental problems with the agreement, particularly relating to matters of national sovereignty. Madame Lalumière had also concluded that so many reservations were being incorporated into the agreement that any value for French investors would be limited. M. Jospin noted that, in February 1998, the French government had identified respect for cultural differences as a requirement for French support for the agreement. In particular, he was concerned that the French film industry needed protection against US imports.\n\nOf equal or greater significance was the importance accorded by Mme. Lalumière to the global protest movement which at that time she attributed to the work and influence of NGOs:\n\nMme. Lalumière argued, however, that France should continue to pursue further liberalisation of investment régimes though \"not\" in the OECD. \"On the one hand, under these conditions it would be impossible to achieve the balancing of the concessions demanded by the firms and, on the other, the objections of the opponents would be just as fierce.\" France was followed by a succession of other nations including Canada and Australia whose governments had been under relentless pressure from civil society to abandon or radically revamp the MAI.\n\nProponents of MAI (such as the United States, Canada, and several EU members) continue to promote investment provisions similar to MAI through regional trade agreements, bilateral investment treaties, bilateral free-trade agreements and discussion at the World Trade Organization to be incorporated into the General Agreement on Trade in Services. Before the end of 1998, the UK trade minister Brian Wilson began to announce that investment negotiations could be shifted to the WTO.\nThe UK Government appears to be taking a surprisingly complacent approach towards the WTO. When the MAI collapsed, then Trade Minister Brian Wilson appeared to have understood some of the concerns raised. He called for any new negotiations to start with a 'blank sheet of paper' based on objectives which should 'take full account of social and environmental concerns'. Yet despite these undertakings, the Government is pushing for the WTO to cover foreign investment according to the same principles. It is a driving force behind the EU proposal on investment. In doing so it is ignoring the widespread opposition to the MAI and the mounting evidence of the WTO's abject failings. A senior treasury officer, cited in a 1999 Australian parliamentary report, stated that \"any future work on the matter known as the MAI needed to address the OECD Ministers' requirement to protect the sovereign right to regulate and to ensure citizens were not harmed by efforts to liberalise foreign investment. There was also a need to continue to engage \"civil society\", and to expand participation in the process by countries that were not members of the OECD\"\".\"\n\nAn attempt was made to insert the investment agenda into a new \"Millennium Round\" of trade liberalisation talks to be hosted by the World Trade Organization (WTO). This led to the historic \"Battle of Seattle\" protest actions in November 1999. At the WTO Ministerial in Cancún, Mexico, in September 2003, a group of more than twenty developing countries united to block the inclusion of the Singapore issues, including investments, in the Doha Round of trade talks. One basis of such opposition is outlined in a critical analysis prepared for Canadian universities.\n\nThe OECD promotes the Declaration on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, last revised in 2011. In addition, from May 2006, the OECD has promoted a non-binding set of \"good practices\" for attracting investment, known as The Policy Framework for Investment (PFI).\n\n\n\n\n"}

His career spanned more than six decades, from 1887 to 1949, and included the role of Algernon Moncrieff in the 1895 premiere of Oscar Wilde's \"The Importance of Being Earnest\". \n\nAynesworth generally appeared in drawing room comedy and contemporary high-society dramas, usually avoiding old classics and modern plays about social problems. He retired from the stage in 1938, and made his final acting appearance in the film \"The Last Days of Dolwyn\" in 1949.\n\nAynesworth was born at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, the third son of Major-General Edward Abbot-Anderson (1832–1903) and his first wife, Martha, \"née\" Birkett (1835–1864), who died the day after Aynesworth was born. The eldest son, John Henry, followed his father into the army, and rose to be a Brigadier-General; the middle son, William Maurice, entered the medical profession and became physician to the Princess Royal. Aynesworth attended Chatham House Grammar School, and was then sent to France and Germany to complete his education. While in France he became an habitué of the Comédie-Française, where he studied the techniques of French acting. \"The Times\" said of this period in his life:\n\nAfter returning to England, Aynesworth resolved to pursue a theatrical career, and made his stage debut in April 1887 as an uncredited extra in \"The Red Lamp\" by Outram Tristram, produced by and starring Herbert Beerbohm Tree. He then went as a student to Sarah Thorne's theatre at Margate, before returning to London in November 1887, when he played a small role in a blank-verse tragedy, \"The Witch\", at the St James's Theatre. \"The Standard\" observed, \"Mr. A. E. Aynesworth spoke the few lines allotted to him with distinction\". In March 1888 Aynesworth played in a short-lived piece, \"To the Death\", written by and starring Rutland Barrington. before rejoining the company at the St James's the following month, under the management of John Hare and William Kendal; he played General de Pontac in a revival of \"The Ironmaster\" by Arthur Pinero. Later that year the Hare and Kendal management ended, and Barrington took over as lessee of the St James's; he cast Aynesworth as Lord Ashwell in \"The Dean's Daughter\". Reviewers thought it a difficult role – \"trying\", \"ungrateful and generally ridiculous\" – and singled Aynesworth out for his success in making it work on stage.\nDuring 1890–1892 Aynesworth played a series of roles at the Court Theatre: George Liptott in \"The Weaker Sex\"; Lord St John Brompton in \"Aunt Jack\"; the Hon Brooke Twombley in \"The Cabinet Minister\"; the Hon Gilbert Stukeley in \"The Volcano\"; and Richard Webb in \"The Late Lamented\".\n\nAfter appearing at the Avenue, Globe, Criterion, Daly's and Garrick Theatres, during 1883–1884, Aynesworth joined George Alexander's company at the St James's, where he played Algernon Moncrieff in the first production of \"The Importance of Being Earnest\". He recalled that Wilde attended only one rehearsal, and then called the cast together and told them that he had just witnessed \"a play that reminded him slightly of one that he'd written\", but that the similarity ended there. Despite the author's reservations, the play was enthusiastically received when it opened on 14 February 1895. Looking back in the 1940s, Aynesworth told the journalist and biographer Hesketh Pearson, \"In my fifty-three years of acting, I never remember a greater triumph than [that] first night.\" The role of Algernon brought him to wider public notice than before, and his notices were excellent: \"Mr Aynesworth hits off to perfection the bland effrontery of Moncrieff\"; \"[he] catches the right vein of grave extravagance\";\"exactly catches the tone of well-bred insolence which harmonises best with the author's wit\".\n\nLater in 1895 Alexander led the St James's company on tour, and in September they played a command performance of the comedy-drama \"Liberty Hall\" for Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle. During the rest of the decade Aynesworth appeared at seven London theatres, mostly in society dramas and drawing room comedies, but venturing into Ruritanian romance in an 1896 adaptation of \"The Prisoner of Zenda\". Later in his career he returned to this play, no longer in a juvenile role but as the fatherly Colonel Sapt.\n\nAynesworth began the 1900s playing Lieutenant B. F. Pinkerton in \"Madame Butterfly\", David Belasco's play, which was five years away from becoming much better known in Giacomo Puccini's operatic version. In 1903 he made one of his few appearances in a costume drama, playing Sir John Melville in the 18th-century comedy \"The Clandestine Marriage\". From 1903 to 1907 he established a fruitful stage partnership with Marie Tempest in a series of long-running plays, mostly at the Comedy Theatre, but with one excursion to New York to play \"The Freedom of Suzanne\" at the Empire Theatre.\n\nAt the Duke of York's Theatre in February 1912 Aynesworth appeared as Captain Nicholas Jeyes in Pinero's \"The \"Mind the Paint\" Girl\", after which he went into management for the first time, presenting and starring in \"Ready Money\" at the New Theatre, which ran for more than 200 performances. He continued his career as an actor-manager over the next few years at the Garrick Theatre, and, in partnership with Bronson Albery, the Criterion, and then, with Irving Albery, the Prince of Wales Theatre.\n\nDuring the First World War theatres were asked to keep open to provide entertainment for troops home on leave. Aynesworth complied, and was in demand as actor, producer and contributor to charity performances.\n\nIn 1921 Aynesworth had one of his biggest successes, in the role of Lord Porteus in Somerset Maugham's \"The Circle\". \"The Times\" said that those who saw him would not forget \"the rotund perfection of his performance\", and \"The Play Pictorial\" commented:\n\nThe following year Aynesworth had another characteristic success in \"The Dover Road\" by A. A. Milne, playing \"the tremendous butler, Dominic ... an unbelievably grand creature\". \"The Play Pictorial\" praised \"a masterly study of humorous exposition, and every effect is obtained without apparent effort\".\nIn the 1930s Aynesworth continued to appear in West End plays. His Lord Porteus attracted enthusiastic reviews when \"The Circle\" was revived in 1931. He maintained a keen interest on the doings of a new generation of actors. Asked by an interviewer in 1937 who he thought were the \"real thing\" among the younger actors, he replied, \"that young fellow who played Hamlet – Gielgud – yes, he's certainly the real thing; and that other boy... Laurence Olivier, and the little girl who's played some Shakespeare, Margaretta Scott\". When Gielgud produced and starred in \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" in 1938 he and his colleagues were delighted and encouraged when Aynesworth came backstage after the first night and told them he found the production delightful, catching the original gaiety and \"exactly the right atmosphere\".\n\nAynesworth's last stage role was Lord Conyngham in Laurence Housman's \"Victoria Regina\". \"The Times\" commented \"it is the wit and authority of Mr Allan Aynesworth's Conyngham that here makes all else seem a trifle amateurish\", The play ran for 337 performances, after which Aynesworth retired from theatre performance. His final role was on film, as the elderly Lord Lancaster in \"The Last Days of Dolwyn\" (1949). \"The Times\" summed up his career: \nHe acted in 25 London theatres, most frequently at the Haymarket and the St. James's; and he took part in plays written by over 50 contemporary dramatists. He never appeared in anything by Shaw (though for a while he rehearsed a part in \"You Never Can Tell\") or Granville Barker, for his interest was centred in the comedy of character and he was not sympathetic to the drama of ideas. His favourite part was Charles Surface, which gives a nice indication of his general outlook. He had worked with almost every eminent actor and actress of his day, and appeared before Queen Victoria, King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, King George V and Queen Mary, and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.\n\nAynesworth died at his home in Camberley at the age of 95.\n\n\n\n"}

The organization is based on the belief that solutions and innovations are often found in the grassroots, and therefore works with more than 8,000 community-based groups across the world. These groups help people to help themselves through food production, job-training programs, nutrition education, community economic development, healthcare workshops, youth programming, leadership development and more.\n\nFounded in September 1975 by the late musician Harry Chapin and current executive director, radio host Bill Ayres, World Hunger Year began as a commitment between two friends, and has grown into an award-winning global non-profit. After Harry Chapin died in a car crash in 1981, family, friends, fans and the music community worked to ensure that the vision of WHY lived on. Today, WhyHunger still focuses on several fundamental principles: working together to combat the root causes of hunger, poverty and injustice, supporting grassroots solutions and promoting self-reliance.\n\nWhyHunger's programs work with community-based organizations to build capacity, multiply resources, share stories and develop connections to create a just food system that provides universal access to nutritious and affordable food.\n\nThis artists program enlists performing artists to raise funds and awareness for grassroots organizations fighting hunger and poverty across the world. WhyHunger believes that music and the arts are an important tool in making a difference in the world. Artists Against Hunger & Poverty founding member Bruce Springsteen has raised funds and awareness for WhyHunger and their grassroots partners for the last 20 years. Others, including Jackson Browne, Brandi Carlile, Carlos Santana, O.A.R., Jason Mraz and Jen Chapin are just a few of the many artists who have joined WhyHunger in the fight against hunger.

Published in 1954, \"Witchcraft Today\" recounts Gardner's thoughts on the history and the practices of the witch-cult, and his claim to have met practising witches in 1930s England. It also deals with his theory that the Knights Templar had practised the religion, and that the belief in faeries in ancient, mediaeval and early modern Europe is due to a secretive pygmy race that lived alongside other communities. \"Witchcraft Today\" is one of the foundational texts for the religion of Wicca, along with Gardner's second book on the subject, 1959's \"The Meaning of Witchcraft\".\n\nGerald Gardner in the foreword to Witchcraft Today:\n\nWhilst by the time of writing, Gardner had been initiated into the religion, and had formed his own coven, he did not state this in the book, instead he \"posed as a disinterested anthropologist\". The introduction to the book was written by Margaret Murray, who had widely supported the witch-cult hypothesis in the 1920s and 1930s through her books \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\" and \"The God of the Witches\". In her introduction, she stated that:\nIn the book Gardner also repeats the claim, which had originated with Matilda Joslyn Gage, that 9 million victims were killed in the European witch-hunts.\" Current scholarly estimates of the number of people executed for witchcraft during this time period vary between about 40,000 and 100,000.\n\nThe book contains seven photographs; one depicting the author, another a magician's circle at the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft, a memorial to those killed in the witch hunts, two further images of rooms in the museum, a statue of a horned god, and a painting of a male witch.\"\n\nThe book was initially published in hardback in November 1954 by Rider and Company, and sold at the price of 15 shillings. It was reprinted in August 1956.\n\nIn his biography of Gardner, the researcher Philip Heselton noted that the contents of \"Witchcraft Today\" were essentially a summation of what Gardner had read about witchcraft and other related subjects over a number of years. He remarked that Gardner had probably intended to provide a history of the witch-cult from the Stone Age to the present which made reference to related religious movements, such as those of the druids, Knights Templar and ancient Egyptians. Summing the book up, he described it as \"a record of Gardner's phases of enthusiasm\".\n"}

It is the de facto standard for providing accessibility to free and open desktops, like GNU/Linux or OpenBSD, led by the GNOME Project.\n\nOne common nomenclature to explain an accessibility framework is a usual client-server architecture. In that way, Assistive Technologies (ATs) like screen readers, would be the clients of that framework, and computer applications would be the server. In this architecture, client and server need to communicate with each other, usually using the IPC technology of the platform. Ideally the accessibility framework exposes this to the client and server in a transparent way.\n\nUsually the API for both client-side and server-side applications are the same, and the accessibility framework provides a client-side and a server-side implementation of that API. In the case of GNOME, there are two different APIs, one for the client-side (AT-SPI) and a different one for the server-side (Accessibility Toolkit (ATK)) due to historical reasons related to the underlying technologies.\n\nAT-SPI was originally designed for using Common Object Request Broker Architecture, an object-based IPC/RPC technology, for its transport protocol. The AT-SPI specification itself was tied to CORBA as it was defined in CORBA IDL. AT-SPI used the GNOME project own fast and lightweight CORBA implementation, ORBit, and its own framework for creating CORBA components, Bonobo.\n\nThe GNOME project decided that the 3.0 release will be free of ORBit and Bonobo meaning a D-Bus AT-SPI solution was required. In an effort to move AT-SPI forward, a D-Bus project was started in November 2006. This took the form of a performance and design review available on the GNOME wiki. Work began on the implementation in May 2007. The D-Bus version of AT-SPI, AT-SPI version 2, was released along with GNOME 3.0 in April 2011.\n\nAT-SPI provides an ATK bridge, so all those widgets systems or applications that implement ATK will automatically communicate all its events, to AT-SPI. The GNOME widget system, GTK+, or Mozilla applications like Firefox and Thunderbird for GNU/Linux implement ATK, so they communicate out-of-box with AT-SPI. However, it is completely possible to use AT-SPI without implementing ATK. The D-Bus migration made possible that Qt added AT-SPI support. Qt implemented its own bridge to AT-SPI that was released in alpha status in August 2011 for testing purposes and it was integrated into Qt for general use a year later.\n\nAT/SPI is part of the GNOME Accessibility Framework that was released in 2001. The main development force behind ATK was the Accessibility Program Office (APO) of Sun Microsystems, Inc. (now Oracle) with contributions from many community members.

(The town was named after her paternal grandfather and uncles who settled there in the 1850s.) She moved with her family to Berkeley, California in 1908. She graduated with honors from University of California, Berkeley in 1920, then later earned a Master's degree in political science in 1935.\n\nShe came to the Marine Corps from UC Berkeley in 1943. Her first assignment with the new women’s component was even before public announcement of the establishment of the Women’s Reserve on February 13, 1943. She was named Women's Reserve (WR) representative for Women's Recruit Depot in the Bronx, with the rank of Captain, USMCWR, (with date of rank February 24, 1943).\n\nColonel Towle was named Director when her predecessor, Colonel Ruth Cheney Streeter, retired on December 7, 1945. She served in that capacity until June 1946. In August of the same year, when the Women’s Reserve was deactivated, Colonel Towle returned to the University of California as Assistant Dean of Women.\n\nAgain, after the Congress had authorized the acceptance of women into the regular armed services, the Marine Corps called upon Colonel Towle to direct this organization. On November 4, 1948, she returned to the Corps to become the first Director of Women Marines after they were constituted a regular component.\n\nIn 1950 the Marine Corps contracted the fashion design house of Mainbocher to design new uniforms for the Women Marines. The prototype of the first Marine Corps women's evening dress uniform was tailored expressly for Colonel Towle. It was first worn in public at the 175th anniversary Marine Corps Birthday Ball in 1950. The uniform included a red tiara with gold embellishments. As another design of evening dress uniform was eventually adopted, Colonel Towle's evening dress uniform was a \"one of a kind.\" This uniform is now in the museum collection of Artillery Company of Newport in Newport, Rhode Island.\n\nColonel Towle served as Director of Women Marines until her retirement on April 30, 1953.\n\nHer military awards included the Legion of Merit, Navy Commendation Medal, American Campaign Medal and World War Two Victory Medal. Eight days before Colonel Towle's retirement, President Eisenhower created the National Defense Service Medal retroactive to June 27, 1950. She was, thus, eligible for the medal but it is uncertain if she was ever formally awarded it.\n\nAfter retiring from the Marine Corps, Towle was succeeded by Colonel Julia Hamblet. Towle was later associated with the University of California at Berkeley in various capacities: as Dean of Women from 1953–60; as Assistant Dean of Students from 1960–65; as Dean of Students, 1965–66; and later as Dean of Students, Emeritus. She was the first female to serve as Dean of Students.\n\nTowle died on March 2, 1986 at her home in California at the age of 87.\n\nIn 2005, a new residence hall at U.C. Berkeley was named after Colonel Towle (Katherine A. Towle Hall).\n\n\nTHE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY\nWASHINGTON\nThe Secretary of the Navy takes pleasure in commending LIEUTENANT COLONEL KATHERINE A.

The Center for Biodiversity Management has surveyed over 1,800 plots in tropical forests around the world. They found that no other plot has as many vascular plants as in Tesso Nilo. Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) surveyed forests throughout Sumatra, and also found that Tesso Nilo housed by far the most species.\n\nCritically endangered Sumatran elephants and Sumatran tigers live here.\n\nThe park suffers heavy encroachment from illegal loggers and illegal settlers who clear the park for crops and palm oil plantations, as well as village sites. Already, 28,600 hectares, or about a third of the park, has been deforested. In November 2009, WWF announced that the park had finally been expanded by 44,492 hectares \nbut encroachment still remains a serious problem.\n\nAccording to a WWF report published in June 2013, oil palm plantations cover 36,353 ha of the Tesso Nilo forest complex, with two business groups (Asian Agri and Wilmar Groups) being involved in the trade of the oil palm fruit illegally grown inside the national park.

A revolutionary socialist, he was one of the leading members of the Workers' Communist Party and the Red Electoral Alliance before they merged to form Red. He sat as a member of the Parliament of Norway from 1993 to 1997, becoming the first socialist to the left of the Socialist Left Party and the Labour Party in parliament since 1961. He later lost his position in 1997, and has been a candidate for parliament ever since. He has been a member of the Oslo City Council from 1983 to 1993, and again since 1999. Folkvord has become one of the best-known Norwegian politicians on the left who is not connected with the Labour Party and the Socialist Left Party.\n\nIn the early part of his political career Folkvord was a member of the Red Electoral Alliance. Known for working on several corruption cases earned him the nickname the \"watch dog\". Folkvord's political views turned to communism and anti-capitalism when he became a member of the Workers' Communist Party. From 1990 to 1997 he was Deputy Leader of the Workers' Communist Party and in 2001 he became Deputy Leader of the Red Electoral Alliance alongside Chris Hartmann.\n\nFolkvord is the son of school principal Sverre Folkvord and housewife Eldrid Kjesbu. He finished secondary school earning the examen artium degree in Trondheim and then started studies to become a social worker at the Social School of Trondheim. By 1976 he was the leader of the national Social Agencies Union serving until 1978. In 1982, along with fellow Red Electoral Alliance member Harald Stabell, Folkvord sued Oslo's social-office leading figures, Signe M. Stray Ryssdal and Marit Moe. They accused them of misconduct and of making a false accusation which led to an innocent man going to prison. These accusations eventually led to a police investigation into the matter. After finding no proof of their accusations, Moe sued Folkvord and Stabell for defamatatory charges made against her, but she abstained from pursuing this in court.\n\nFolkvord and Stabell reported to the police that the Norwegian newspaper \"Dagbladet\" breached the pimp paragraph of the criminal code. In an interview Folkvord stated that \"Dagbladet\" contributed to giving the Norwegian sex market more attention.\n\nIn 1983 Folkvord, along with Liv Finstad, was elected as Red Electoral Alliance representative for the Oslo City Council, taking office on 1 January 1984. According to \"Aftenposten\", the Red Electoral Alliance and the Christian Democratic Party had the most loyal voter base throughout the election. Folkvord was later highly vocal in his opposition towards the decentralisation of health and social services in Oslo where control was to be given to the boroughs. During his early years as member of the City Council Folkvord used most of his time in defending the then \"current\" social administration.\n\nBy the late 1980s Folkvord had earned the nickname \"watch dog\", as he usually wanted an \"independent investigation\" into corruption matters. This eventually developed into one of his most well-known public traits. When leading an investigation into a corruption case in 1989, which involved several representatives of the Oslo City Council, he said \"It is possible to sweep corruption and other non-essential nonsense out of City Hall. People only need to persist where necessary\". Earlier that year, when finding more proof of a so-called corruption scandal, Folkvord asked for assistance from the district attorney urging him to lead an investigation into the matter.\n\nBy 1990 there were talks within the Red Electoral Alliance towards replacing Folkvord and Athar Ali as City Council representatives in Oslo to make way for more women in the top positions within the party. Folkvord was kept since he was a well-known face with the Norwegian media. By September 1990 Folkvord had demanded a police-run investigation against Conservative Party member Michael Tetzschner, accusing him of corruption and hidden money. These charges were included in a broadcast by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK). Tetzschner replied to this broadcast stating that \"The news feature was completely dominated by false information. If the television provider does not make the corrections that are necessary, we'll bring the case to the Complaints Board of the Broadcasting Corporation\". Folkvord is one of the co-founders of the Oslo party cell, established in early 1991, of the Red Electoral Alliance. While media speculated that he would become the chapter's leader, he denied any such allegations, saying their existed \"better suited people\" then him for that post.\n\nFolkvord was elected the Red Electoral Alliance's Oslo lead candidate in June 1992. The decision was made based on party leader Aksel Nærstad's belief that Folkvord could easily win a seat since he had become a \"national celebrity\" of sorts and due to the support Folkvord enjoyed during the 1989 parliamentary election. Folkvord needed 14,000 votes to earn a seat in parliament. In January 1993, at the national convention, several long-standing members discussed the best way to organise Folkvord's Oslo electoral campaign. There was optimism among these members believed, along with Nærstad, and they believed before hand that Folkvord would be elected to parliament. The Red Electoral Alliance used a total of for their nationwide 1993 election campaign, two thirds of it being used to support Folkvords campaign in Oslo. When announcing the results the party managed to become the biggest party in six different constituencies: Grünerløkka, Ankertorget, Tøyen, Kampen, Vålerenga and Gamlebyen. Various analysists, and Folkvord himself, believed the Red Electoral Alliance achieved good results in Oslo because of the Socialist Left Party's bad election results in the municipality.\n\nWhen asked what parliamentary committee he wanted to be a member of Folkvord replied that the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs would be an ideal choice because most of the \"assaults\" on the working man had their origins in that committee. He was then selected for that very committee in addition to a seat on the Election Committee. He later became elected as a member of the financial committee of parliament.\n\nIn 1994 Folkvord criticised the Labour Government for exporting weapons to Turkey, which at that time was engaged in a civil war against the Kurdish people. He claimed it violated a parliamentary decision made in 1959 which said that the government would not distribute, or export, weapons to countries involved in a civil war. Folkvord earned the support of the Socialist Left, the Centre Party and the Christian Democratic Party who all sought to end weapon exports to Turkey. The Conservative Party supported the Labour Party's decision however, with the then party leader Jan Petersen claiming that the Kurdish liberators were \"terrorists\". According to \"Arbeiderbladet\" the Norwegian Government had sold worth of weapons to the Turkish Government in 1989 alone. Folkvord sent a letter to Bjørn Tore Godal, the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, and asked if the Norwegian Government had gotten the approval of the parliament's Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to sell weapons to Turkey. In a 1967 decree it became illegal to sell weapons to civil war torned countries, and Folkvord believed that Norway should stopp selling weapons to a country which he considered to be embroilled by civil war.\n\nOn 1 September 1995 Folkvord was arrested by Turkish law enforcement in the Kurdish city of Diyarbakir. The Turkish Government said the main reason was his visit to an illegal Kurdish peace festival. That very same day he was flown to Ankara, and later Istanbul and the following day he was delivered back to Norway. Nicolas Rea, a member of the British House of Lords, took a picture of Folkvord during the event. It was claimed that the picture showed Folkvord being beaten by Turkish officials and that the picture was in-turn burnt by the Turkish police when they saw Rea had a camera.\n\nIn early 1995 Folkvord announced that he would not be a candidate for parliament when his term was over. He later claimed the job was \"exhausting and stressful\". In an opinion poll, conducted in August 1997, Folkvords popularity in Oslo had declined while his popularity outside Oslo had increased. During the election the party used on Folkvord's re-election campaign, which was estimated to be around 70% of party's budget estimated to be around . On 12 September various opinion polls showed that Folkvords popularity had increased again in Oslo which gave rise to speculation that Folkvord would win Inger Lise Husøy's seat in parliament because of this sudden rise in popularity. When 99% of the vote in Oslo had been counted the party had managed to earn a disappointing 3.9%, losing its only seat.\n\nAfter losing his position in parliament, Folkvord went through a short-period of obscurity. He once again earned media attention when he publicly denounced the Lund Commission. The commission revealed there had been extensive surveillance of Norwegian communists, socialists and other radicals by the Norwegian Police Security Service. Folkvord demanded to be shown his own documentation created during the surveillance. In 1999 Folkvord topped his party's list of candidates running for a seat in the City Council. Folkvord was successful and earned a seat on the City Council while the party noted an increase of 1.3%. Folkvords main goal during the campaign was to earn a third seat for the Red Electoral Alliance, he failed to do so though the party held its two seats on the City Council. The party earned 2% and 2.1% of the vote in the county and municipal elections of 1999.\n\nBefore the 2001 parliamentary election both Aslak Sira Myhre, leader of the Red Electoral Alliance, and Folkvord stated their intentions of being top candidate for the Red Electoral Alliance. Later, when hearing that Myhre sought to become the party's lead candidate in Oslo, Folkvord told the media he would become third candidat if he was not elected to become the party's lead candidate. A vote was held at the party convention, which resulted in 50 votes for and 62 against Folkvord as lead candidate. Folkvord became third candidate, and Sigrid Angen became second candidate.\n\nBy February 2001 the Workers' Communist Party proposed making Folkvord the new leader of the Red Electoral Alliance, since Myhre would resign if he was elected to parliament. While the majority of the members wanted a female leader after the departure of Myhre, his supporters were perfectly aware that Folkvord could lose the nomination and a campaign was started to make him deputy leader. The main problem for Folkvord's opposition was his close ties to the Workers' Communist Party. At the convention Myhre was re-elected the party's party leader, with Folkvord and Chris Hartmann stepping in as the party's new deputy leaders. Myhre did not become a member of parliament.\n\nBy March 2003 Myhre had resigned as leader and Torstein Dahle was elected as his successor. Dahle had been the leading figure of the Red Electoral Alliance in Hordaland since the 1990s. When commenting on his resignation, Myhre commented on his 2001 election in Oslo saying \"it is sad to resign after a bad election\". During the 2003 local elections three different polls showed that the Red Electoral Alliance was close to earning three seats on the Oslo City Council. Folkvord stated that if the party managed to earn one extra seat, he would use try removing the right-wing Conservative Party from power and replace them with a more left-wing \"leaning choice\" — such as the Labour Party or the Socialist Left Party. The party increased its vote by 0.1%, earning the party 3.1% of the popular vote in Oslo. The party was not able to win a third seat, retaining the two they held.\n\nIn February 2004 Folkvord was charged with violating the penal code as he had participated in a demonstration against the Invasion of Iraq in 2003. Together with other demonstrators he effectively cut off the entrance to the office of Kristin Krohn, the Minister of Defence. Folkvord was accused in a statement saying \"his refusal to walk away from the area where it was held an illegal demonstration, despite the fact that he was asked to leave the area\". After the incident he received a fine of which he refused to pay.\n\nAt the Red Electoral Alliance's city convention Folkvord was elected their lead candidate in Oslo for the 2005 election. Folkvord, along with Torstein Dahle, were the only representatives from the party who had a chance of gaining a seat in parliament. Jens Stoltenberg, leader of the Labour Party, was negative towards the idea of having any representatives from the Red Electoral Alliance in parliament, saying that the voters should do anything in their power to stop them from earning a seat in parliament. When the votes were counted Folkvord did not gain a seat in parliament.\n\nFolkvord later accused many of the prominent members of the Oslo City Council of being involved, or having been involved, in corruption. André Støylen of the Conservative Party said Folkvord should stop accusing and instead go to the police with proof if he had any.\nOn 27 February 2007 Folkvord announced he would seek another term in the City Council. Folkvord was re-elected lead candidate for the municipal election at the party convention. In March 2007 the Red Electoral Alliance and the Workers' Communist Party merged and established Red. By 3 September, six days before the election day, Red earned its best showing ever in Oslo earning 4.4% in an opinion poll — an increase of 0.3% from the previous election. When the votes for the municipality of Oslo were counted the party had managed to gain three seats on the City Council, with Folkvord's position secure. At national level Red had received 1.9% and 2.1% for the municipal and county elections respectively.\n\nDuring the 2009 election several opinion polls showed that Folkvord and Dahle had enough support to earn two seats in parliament. Jens Stoltenberg and Kristin Halvorsen from the Red-Green Coalition were both highly negative towards the idea of having Red in parliament. Folkvord stated several times that he would demand an immediate withdrawal of Norwegian troops from Afghanistan if elected to parliament. He said this decision involved both the \"enthusiastic warriors of the Progress Party\" and \"the disillusioned skeptics of the Socialist Left\". Folkvord later felt he needed to set pressure on the Labour Party which would, according to him, move them further to the left. Labour Party member Reiulf Steen had reacted positively towards the idea of having Folkvord in parliament saying, \"I am a great admirer of Erling Folkvord. He has integrity and great courage. Besides I am overjoyed that Red supports the Red-Green coalition\". When the votes were counted Red had an increase of 1% from the 2005 election, but it was not enough to secure Folkvord a seat in parliament. When all the votes were counted the party had gained 1.3% of the national vote, an increase of 0.1%.\n\nDuring an interview in 1993, Folkvord said his most important commitment if he gained a seat in parliament was giving the National trade union centers more power so that they could better defend the working class. When asked if it was exhausting to promote socialist reforms Folkvord said, \"It is. But I think in some ways easier than before [because many] fake socialist regimes have collapsed\". Another opinion of his was that \"capitalism destroys the natural environment around us making the bourgeois society planners understand that there must be something new in the future. This provides inspiration to win support for socialist beliefs in Norway\". Folkvord's first contact with anti-capitalist beliefs came when he joined the Workers' Communist Party. The party taught him about \"capitalist barbarism\" and how the wealthy controlled everything. Folkvord said he believed that \"[this] can't be the end of human development\", and that he believes humans are destined to create another more-just system.\n\nFolkvord has long supported the Kurdish independence movement, believing that Norway and other countries in Europe should stop treating the conflicts between Turkish military and the Kurds as an internal Turkish matter. Being an anti-war activist he was highly vocal against Norwegian involvement in the War on Terror since the start of the American led invasion of Iraq. In 2009 Folkvord visited Norwegian soldiers in Afghanistan but claimed that Red was the only Norwegian party not allowed to visit the Afghan city of Meymaneh, the city were the Norwegian troops are stationed. He is also highly vocal against Norwegian membership in the European Union, claiming the organisation is spreading \"German imperialism\".\n\nSince earning the position of Oslo City Council representative in 1984, Folkvord has used much of his time writing books about his political experiences and beliefs. His books have earned much attention by the Norwegian media. He has also collaborated on several books, the most notable being \"Rapport fra rottereiret – korrupsjon i Norge\". In the book Folkvord claimed that Lise Harlem was involved in some sort of corruption in Norway, although to verify this he had only one source, Knut Frigaard. Harlem later wrote an article in \"Aftenposten\" stating that the book was \"dubiously\" written and unreliable. The book also received support from Carl August Fleischer and Liberal Party politician Helge Seip who defended the book against the accusations. Folkvord wrote \"Rødt!\" in 1998, a book about his tenure as a parliamentary representative. Twelve pages were about Folkvords four-year-term as representative, the other pages contained information criticising fellow parliamentary representatives. When writing the book, he wanted it to have some sort of impact on Red Youth members and other left of center groups or activists. \"Operasjon Heilomvending\", published in 2007, contained a large amount of criticism of the Socialist Left Party, the Labour Party and the Red-Green Coalition in general. The book \"Vår korrupte hovedstad\" (\"Our Corrupt Capital\"), was published in 2011. In 2015 his book [\"the great Oslo robbery\"] \"Det store Oslo-ranet\" was published.\n\nFolkvord has a daughter named Jorunn Folkvord who works as a teacher and is a member of the Norwegian teachers union, Union of Education Norway. She was notable for her far-left political activities in Norway, having membership status in the Workers' Communist Party and the Red Electoral Alliance. She took part in several notable protests during the 1990s, in one case being arrested by the police. She was also the Leader of Red Youth during the early 1990s.\n\n"}
