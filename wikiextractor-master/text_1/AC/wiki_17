According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality is officially the Summer Capital of Ilocos Sur. It has a relatively cooler climate than most of lowland Ilocos Sur due to its geographical location and proximity to Mountain Province and Benguet. The municipality is home to the Bessang Pass Natural Monument.\n\nHow it got the name is not known or documented but it is believed that it was named after the famous poet Miguel de Cervantes. But the town's history was tied to the poet's name and the people living on the town adopted it as their own official name.\n\nThe earliest known historical document about Cervantes was that, it started as a small Igorot Village known as “Mantamang”, an Igorot word meaning “to look over”. Igorot traders and Chinese merchants who always had to pass the village frequently used man and horse trails connecting the lowland and upland neighboring localities.\n\nOn March 4, 1879, the residents of Mantamang petitioned that the village be recognized as a Christian town under Lepanto-Amburayan sub-province of Mountain Province. The town was given the name Cervantes and that remained the name of the town up to the present.\n\nMaximo Lilio de Garcia has written that Cervantes was formerly a barrio when it was founded by the Spanish colonizers. It started with only thirty (30) houses made of light building materials like bamboo and cogon. In spite of the fertile lands that abound the place the native used to cultivate only small patches of ricefield, which made the barrio unprogressive.\n\nLilio further stated that Cervantes has a distance of twenty-four (24) kilometers from Lepanto. The system of communication was maintained on weekly basis due to its poor road that traversed the sloppy mountains zigzagging upward the hills back of Cayus where the storage house was located and down to the lowlands reaching the Malaya River, which sometimes overflow during rainy season making the trail slippery.\n\nDuring the Spanish Era, a portion of the land near the Abra River bank was used as a penal colony by the Spanish soldiers who brought with them the Ilocanos from the lowlands. In 1883, a Malaria epidemic affected the colony prompting the Spanish officials to move to the upland, which is now the present location of the town proper. 5,000 grams of quinine ended the epidemic.\n\nAt that time the barrio was founded between Abra and Malaya Rivers, the inhabitants were distributed among the three (3) rancheria. The first settlement was established on an elevated healthful well-ventilated place, where a small house for the children of the neighboring barrios a storage building for tobacco and barracks were constructed. Springs were the source of potable clean and abundant water supply. The natives cultivated and produced vegetables and fruits suitable to the climate. Coffee was produced on the land annexed to the commendancia.\n\nThe next group of settlement founded a rancheria less than a half-kilometer distance from the first settlement. This time better types of houses were built with an estimated population of 819 residents migrating from other rancherias and barrios of Mailac Cambaguio and Magucmay. Then another small community was developed with both sections of Cervantes where a spacious administrative building, other ruinous edifices and barracks built of wood for the civil guards, were located.\n\nGradually these original settlers of the area, the Igorot were displaced and forced to move to the hills and mountains. This explains why at present Igorot are mostly settled in far-flung barrios while the Ilocanos, mestizos and those who intermarried with Chinese, Spaniards, Americans and other foreigners populate the central area of the municipality.\n\nThe constantly growing of trade in this mountain area made it necessary that it should have a good outlet to the coast. A road was constructed from Cervantes going west over the Malaya Range exiting at the town of Tagudin, Ilocos Sur. This road was later improved and widened and became passable all the way to Bontoc.\n\nDuring the American rule, the Philippine Commission passed Act No. 410 and Sec. 1 of said act, states: “The territory hitherto comprised in the Commendancia of Lepanto, Bontoc and Amburayan, together with territory lying between the boundaries of Abra, Cagayan and Bontoc and not hitherto include within the limits of any province organized under the provincial government act is hereby constituted a province, which shall be known as the Province of Lepanto-Bontoc. This province as divided into three sub-provinces. The sub-province of Lepanto that shall comprise the territory hitherto included in the commendancia of Lepanto. The sub-province of Bontoc that shall comprise the territory hitherto includes in the commendancia of Bontoc and not hitherto included within the boundaries of any province organized under the Provincial Government Act. The sub-province of Amburayan, which shall comprise the territory hitherto included in the commendancia of Amburayan. The town Cervantes prior to its becoming a seat of government of Amburayan sub-province of Mountain Provbince was a capital of a military province by the Americans when they captured Cervantes. Its military governor was William Dinweddie.\n\nLater on, Cervantes became a pueblo by virtue of Act No. 441 of the Philippine Commission, which is an act providing for the establishment of a local civil government in the townships and settlements of the Province of Lepanto-Bontoc. And in 1907, Cervantes was transferred to the Province of Ilocos Sur by virtue of the provisions of Act No. 1646, passed by the Philippines Commission on May 15, 1907 providing for the transfer of all sub-provinces of Amburayan and large sections of Lepanto and Benguet to Ilocos Sur and La Union.\n\nIn June 1945 the USAFIP NL spearheaded by the 121st Infantry, defeated the Japanese Imperial Forces at Bessang Pass, part of Malaya, Cervantes. During the Japanese occupation it was at Cervantes, particularly at Bessang Pass, that the Japanese forces made their last stand in the operations in the North against a band of Filipino Soldiers and Guerrillas. These events hasten the surrender of General Tomoyuki Yamashita, who is referred to as the “Tiger of Malaya”.\n\nIn 1945, Cervantes was burned and destroyed. The brick municipal building, Conchar Hotel, and the sturdy and beautiful houses of the town were burned and reduced to ashes. The main bridge that links Cervantes to Bontoc was bombed.\n\nA handsome monument was unveiled in 1954 at Bessang Pass in honor of the 1,395 United States Armed Forces in the Philippines - Northern Luzon (USAFIP-NL) members killed in this historical place. After the war the town is on its way to recovery and self-sufficiency.\n\nThe Cervantes Elementary School is here since the Spanish Regime. It now has 18 primary and Elementary Schools. Saint Agnes Elementary School was founded on February 18, 1920 and on June 10, 1949 the CICM and ICM missionaries inaugurated the Saint Agnes High School. In 1972 Republic Act 4424 established the Cervantes National School of Arts and Trade, which at present the Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College- Cervantes Campus. Another milestone of education was in 1999 when the Cervantes National High School was established, through the initiative of Mayor Benjamin N. Maggay during his first term.\n\nThe Cervantes Emergency Hospital was established in 1916 through the initiative of then Governor Calvo of Mt. Province. On June 1960, republic Act No. 2775 changed the name of the Cervantes Emergency hospital to Bessang Pass Memorial Hospital in memory of the heroes of Bessang Pass.\nCervantes was energized on March 21, 1991. The power supply came from Mt. Province Electric Cooperative (MOPRECO) through a memorandum of agreement with Ilocos Sur Electric Cooperative (ISECO).\n\nCervantes became the Summer Capital of the Province of Ilocos Sur by Resolution No. 88 Series of 1993 “A Resolution Declaring Cervantes as the Summer Capital of the Province of Ilocos Sur on March 23, 1993.\n\nOn July 5, 1995 an interim Protected Area Management Board (PAMB) was organized and on April 23, 2000 President Joseph Ejercito Estrada signed Proclamation No. 284 declaring Bessang Pass National Shrine as Protected Areas (included to NIPAS Act of 1992 or RA 7560) under Natural Monument/Landmark Category.\n\nOn June 11, 1996 the Municipal Government passed Resolution No. 025 series of 1996 declaring June 14 as special non-working holiday for the town of Cervantes.\n\nCervantes lies along the southeastern tip of the province located directly north of both are Manila and Baguio City. It is cut southwesterly by the biggest and longest river in the area, the Abra River.\n\nCervantes is politically subdivided into 13 barangays.\n\n\nIn the , the population of Cervantes, Ilocos Sur, was people, with a density of .\n\n"}

This results in an ideal \"thumbtack\" auto-ambiguity function, making the arrays useful in applications such as sonar and radar. Costas arrays can be regarded as two-dimensional cousins of the one-dimensional Golomb ruler construction, and, as well as being of mathematical interest, have similar applications in experimental design and phased array radar engineering.\n\nCostas arrays are named after John P. Costas, who first wrote about them in a 1965 technical report. Independently, Edgar Gilbert also wrote about them in the same year, publishing what is now known as the logarithmic Welch method of constructing Costas arrays.\n\nA Costas array may be represented numerically as an \"n\"×\"n\" array of numbers, where each entry is either 1, for a point, or 0, for the absence of a point. When interpreted as binary matrices, these arrays of numbers have the property that, since each row and column has the constraint that it only has one point on it, they are therefore also permutation matrices. Thus, the Costas arrays for any given \"n\" are a subset of the permutation matrices of order \"n\".\n\nArrays are usually described as a series of indices specifying the column for any row. Since it is given that any column has only one point, it is possible to represent an array one-dimensionally. For instance, the following is a valid Costas array of order \"N\" = 4:\n\nThere are dots at coordinates: (1,2), (2,1), (3,3), (4,4)\n\nSince the \"x\"-coordinate increases linearly, we can write this in shorthand as the set of all \"y\"-coordinates. The position in the set would then be the \"x\"-coordinate. Observe: {2,1,3,4} would describe the aforementioned array. This makes it easy to communicate the arrays for a given order of \"N\".\n\nAll Costas array orders are known for orders 1 through 29 Enumeration is as in the following table.\n\nEnumeration of known Costas arrays to order 200, order 500 and to order 1030 are available. Although these lists and databases of these Costas arrays are likely near complete, other Costas arrays with orders above 29 that are not in these lists may exist.\n\nA Welch–Costas array, or just Welch array, is a Costas array generated using the following method, first discovered by Edgar Gilbert in 1965 and rediscovered in 1982 by Lloyd R. Welch.\nThe Welch–Costas array is constructed by taking a primitive root \"g\" of a prime number \"p\" and defining the array \"A\" by formula_1 if formula_2, otherwise 0. The result is a Costas array of size \"p\" − 1.\n\nExample:\n\n3 is a primitive element modulo 5.\n\nTherefore, [3 4 2 1] is a Costas permutation. More specifically, this is an exponential Welch array. The transposition of the array is a logarithmic Welch array.\n\nThe number of Welch–Costas arrays which exist for a given size depends on the totient function.\n\nThe Lempel–Golomb construction takes α and β to be primitive elements of the finite field GF(\"q\") and similarly defines formula_1 if formula_4, otherwise 0. The result is a Costas array of size \"q\" − 2. If \"α\" + \"β\" = 1 then the first row and column may be deleted to form another Costas array of size \"q\" − 3: such a pair of primitive elements exists for every prime power \"q>2\".\n\nGeneration of new Costas arrays by adding or subtracting a row/column or two with a 1 or a pair of 1's in a corner were published in a paper focused on generation methods and in Golomb and Taylor's landmark 1984 paper.\n\nMore sophisticated methods of generating new Costas arrays by deleting rows and columns of existing Costas arrays that were generated by the Welch, Lempel or Golomb generators were published in 1992. There is no upper limit on the order for which these generators will produce Costas arrays.\n\nTwo methods that found Costas arrays up to order 52 using more complicated methods of adding or deleting rows and columns were published in 2004 and 2007.\n\n\n\n"}

The fishermen consulted this matter to the friars in Villa Fernandina (now Vigan), who identified the person depicted by the statue. The statue was carried to the town's center, where a church was built. From then on, the town formerly known as \"Tuanong\" (sometimes called \"Taonan\") became \"San Vicente.\"\n\nIn tracing the history of San Vicente, one always has to start from Vigan. Vigan was established by the Spanish colonizer, Juan de Salcedo on June 13, 1573 up to 1582, there were only 800 residents.\n\nUpon Salcedo’s return in 1574, he brought with them the Augustinian friars in order to teach Christianity to the inhabitants. After Salcedo’s death on March 11, 1576, Franciscan friars replaced the Augustinians in the year 1579. These same friars spread up to San Vicente to convert the people to the Catholic faith.\n\nIn 1591, Vigan has already an organized form of government, which included these barrios namely: Bo. Tuanong, Bo. Santa Catalina de Baba and Bo. Caoayan. There were then a population numbering about 4,000 inhabitants.\n\nBetween the years 1720 and 1737, the first chapel of Bo. Tuanong was erected. Later in 1748, the Confraternity of Jesus of Nazareth was organized. In one record of the Vigan Convent archives, a funeral that happened on January 29, 1748 at the Chapel Bo. Tuanong was recorded. Two chaplains Bro. Don Agustin de la Encarnacion and Don Pedro Geronimo de Barba were the priest stone the chapel in that year 1748. It is believed that the chapel is the first stone building that sees upon entering the San Vicente Central School from the main road. Bo. Tuanong which belonged to Vigan was the old name of San Vicente.\n\nOn June 16, 1751, the chaplain was Don Miguel de Montanez. He was the first priest there and also in the chapel of San Sebastian. It is found out that Barangay San Sebastian already erected.\n\nHardship in reaching Bo. Tuanong and Bo. Santa Catalina de Baba from Vigan especially during the months of June to October was experienced, due to the absence of dike or bridge. Priests from Vigan reached these places by means of a raft. The problem prompted the separation of these two barrios from Vigan in 1793.\n\nIn 1795, it was the initiation of the seat of municipality and the church and Bo. Tuanong became San Vicente de Ferrer. Don Pedro de Leon was the first parish priest and he was believed as the initiator of the construction of the Church of San Vicente.\n\nSan Vicente is politically subdivided into 7 barangays.\n\n\nIn the , the population of San Vicente, Ilocos Sur, was people, with a density of .\n\n"}

The Augustinian established missionary centers in the towns of Vigan in 1575 and Santa in 1576. On the founding of Bantay in 1591 as a pueblo, Santa was made its “visita” until 1713 when it became an independent vicariate. The prestige of the town was boosted in 1802 when the provisional diocese was established and was housed in the rectory of Santa until 1834.\n\nThe “Malong Revolt” disturbed the quiet life of the town in 1660-1661 when Andres Malong of Binalatongan (now San Carlos City in Pangasinan province) rose in arms to protest the abuses in the collection of tribute and in the conscription of men for “palo y servicios” (forced labor). Malong proclaimed himself “King of Pangasinan” and tried to extend his kingdom by sending his Count Pedro Gumapos to Ilocos.\n\nGumapos pursued the retreating Spaniards who sought refuge in Agoo in present-day La Union. The Spaniards and the loyalists made their last stand in Pideg, Santa. Pedro de la Peña, who was defending Pideg Pass, sheltered the great number of the rebels who camped in nearby Narvacan and offered them free passage across Pideg Pass.\n\nOn December 14, 1762, Diego Silang led the “caillianes” (common man or townsfolk) in the most obstinate insurrection against the Spaniards in the 18th century. He crystallized the discontent of the “caillianes” caused by the imposition of tribute and forced labor. He proclaimed a “Free Ilocos” and made Vigan its capital.\n\nWhen the Spaniards failed to stop Diego Silang in combat, Miguel Vicos aided by Pedro Becbec who were both Silang's trusted friends, betrayed Diego Silang by shooting him in the back on May 26, 1763. Gabriela, the wife of Diego with the help of her uncle, Nicolas Cariño, continued her husband's fight and defeated the Spaniards and their soldiers in the battle of Banaoang, Santa on August 24, 1763.\n\nA destructive flood called “Layos Bungsot” (literal: \"Flood of Rotting\") of 1852 eroded the first poblacion founded in 1576 and caused the town center to be transferred to a new site, which is about south of the first site. Fr. Pedro Torrices started the new church in 1849-1855 and Fr. Luis Lagar finished it in 1875.\n\nIn 1905, another destructive flood, “Layos Nawnaw” (literal: \"Dissolving Flood\") motivated the people to transfer the poblacion to Pasungol in the southern part of the town in 1907. Don Domingo Bueno y Ramirez, the \"presidente municipal\" (town mayor), transferred the government, and the new poblacion was laid out. Circumferential roads were laid out in the shape of a spider web with the town plaza in the middle. A \"hermita\" made of bamboo and cogon grass was put up, and a one-storey primary school building was constructed.\n\nThe guerrilla activities of Gen. Manuel Tinio dominated the Philippine-American War in Ilocos. The civil government of Ilocos Sur began to function in 1889 with Don Mena Crisologo, the former Ilocos Sur delegate to the Malolos Congress, as the first Civil Governor.\n\nOn December 19, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army landed in Santa. The people fled to the mountains where they suffered from privations, hunger and diseases. The Japanese soldiers held a garrison at the south of Quirino Bridge and massacred 70 civilians in Barrio Rizal on January 26, 1945.\n\nIn 1945, local Filipino forces under the Philippine Commonwealth Army 1st and 12th Infantry Division, Philippine Constabulary 1st Constabulary Regiment and the USAFIP-NL 121st Infantry Regiment liberate the town of Santa and they defeats and fought against the Japanese Imperial forces and ended World War II. On the resumption of the Commonwealth Government after the war, Pres. Sergio Osmeña appointed Sixto Brillantes after being elected as assemblyman of the second district of Ilocos Sur.\n\nThe municipality of Santa is triangular shape. Its northern border, forming the baseline of the triangular land and running in the east-west direction, follow the ever-changing course of the Abra River from the Banaoang Gap in the north-east corner of the town to the sea for about . Some islands of the river delta are settled by the people of Santa. The largest island, Barangay Rancho, is connected by a bridge to the main town. Another island occupied by Brgys. Dammay and Oribi is only accessible by boat.\n\nPolitically, Santa is bordered by towns of Bantay and Caoayan of Ilocos Sur to the north; the town of San Quintin in Abra province to the east; and Narvacan, Ilocos Sur to the south.\n\nSanta is north of Manila and south of Vigan, the capital of the province. It can be reached by bus, jeepney and other motorized means of transport by way of the National Highway.\n\nSanta has an area of , which is distributed in twenty-six (26) barangays and constitutes almost 4.2% of the entire area of the province of Ilocos Sur.\nThe topography of the municipality is undulating to rolling with slope ranging from 0-30%.\n\nThere are three types of soil in Santa, namely: clay loam which is used for crop production, clay on the eastern part of the town and sandy loam on the western part. Although Santa has fair type of soil, vegetative cover is good for rice, corn, vegetables and fruit-bearing trees.\n\nMajor mineral resources of the municipality are salt from the coast, and gravel and sand washed down the river banks of Abra River. Gravel and sand are gathered along the river bank and sold for construction. Salt-making is found along the coastal barangays of Santa with some of the residents engaged in the industry as their means of livelihood.\n\nBecause of its location, Santa has been plagued by disasters and calamities since the Spanish Colonial Period (See Destructive flooding below). During heavy rains, large amount of water coming down from the Central Cordillera Mountains flows down to the sea through the Abra River, the sixth largest river system in the Philippines, devastating Santa which traverses the western part of the municipality. Flood prone areas in the western part of the town include Barangays Pasungol, Tabucolan, Calungboyan, Casiber, Rancho, Oribi and Dammay. Even places located at the foot of the mountain are also prone to flash floods because of the denuded mountain east of the town. During the typhoon of June 5, 1999, the storm surge devastated Santa destroying residences along the coastal barangays.\n\nThe type of climate in Santa is generally the same as the climate of all coastal towns of Ilocos Sur. There are two seasons in the region, wet and dry season. The dry season commences in the month of February and ends in the month of June while the wet season is during the rest of the year.\n\nThe Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) data for the municipality gives the annual average temperature at . April and May were recorded as the hottest months with a temperature from respectively while the coldest months are January and February with a temperature ranging from .\n\nDuring the rainy season, Santa experience more or less 20 typhoons a year. Rainfall record of Santa is the same as the records of other municipalities of Ilocos Sur. Average monthly average during the wet season is estimated at .\n\nSanta is politically subdivided into 26 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Santa, Ilocos Sur, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe Banaoang Gap is a water gap about long formed by the Abra River by cutting three consecutive tall mountain ridges in the Ilocos Range. It separates Santa and Bantay towns and stretches to San Quintin, Abra. The gap is spanned by the old and new Quirino Bridges connecting the two towns. A viewing deck is located in Barangay Banaoang in Santa offering dramatic view of the bridge and the broad Abra River backdropped by Mount Tetas de Santa, Mount Binitalo and the other mountains in the Ilocos Range.\n\nLocated southeast of Santa and partly in Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, the Northern Heroes Hill National Park was established on July 9, 1963 by Proclamation No. 132 encompassing of beautiful mountain scenery.\n\nLocated west of the national park along the National Highway is the Old Pideg Pass, the historic gateway to Santa, renamed Diego-Gabriela Silang Pass in 1976. The Gabriela Silang Memorial Park was erected here dedicated to Gabriela who was born in the old barrio of Caniogan in Santa on March 19, 1731 and is regarded as the first heroine of Ilocos.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nWith an area of , it is the smallest municipality in the province and the only municipality in Ilocos Sur which has an urban status for all its barangays based on National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB).\n\nThe feast of the town is celebrated every 25th day of November to celebrate the feast day of Saint Catherine of Alexandria (the town's patron saint).\n\nWhen the Augustinians were busy with the Christianization of the Ilocos Region, a group of missionaries sailed westward through the river known as \"El Mestizo\" to the place now called Santa Catalina. They were also looking for fresh water, since the area where he landed yielded only salty water. When they finally found a fresh water spring up north, and were busy quenching their thirst, some of them saw an image of a beautiful lady near the place where he drank, which disappeared after a few minutes. One of them recognized the image as that of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The Augustinians returned to Villa Fernandina (Vigan) and reported this matter to their superiors. This resulted in the construction of a church in the town with Saint Catherine of Alexandria as the patron saint. It was also declared that \"Santa Catalina\" be the name of the town.\n\nA replica of the cross once planted by Salcedo and his party—to signify that the Spanish has conquered the area—stands near the entrance to the municipality.\n\nSanta Catalina is politically subdivided into 9 barangays.\n\nIt has 3 sitios, namely:\n\nIn the , the population of Santa Catalina, Ilocos Sur, was people, with a density of .\n\nAs of February 2006, Santa Catalina with a poverty incidence of 7.9 percent and Vigan City with a poverty incidence of 8.6 percent, are the top two municipalities/cities with lowest poverty incidences in Ilocos Sur, and for the entire northern Luzon. This is among the results of the Poverty Mapping Project implemented by the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) with funding assistance from the World Bank ASEM Trust Fund in response to the increasing demand for local level poverty estimates.\n\nA total of 696.5888 hectares or 74.581% of the total land area of Santa Catalina is utilized for crop production. Croplands are found in every barangay. The whole area of 696.588 hectares is planted with rice during rainy season. 30 hectares or 4.31 percent of the total agricultural land is planted with white corn while 20 hectares or 2.87 percent are planted with corn. Next to rice/corn season, farmers also plant vegetables with a total effective area of 1,150 hectares or 165.09 percent of the agricultural lands. Onions, cabbage, cauliflower, sweet pepper, eggplant, beans, tomato, sweet potato, yam beans, mongo and peanut are the vegetables that are planted. Because of the limited agricultural land in the municipality, inter cropping farming system are commonly practiced. As had been mentioned earlier that 696.588 hectares are planted with rice and corn while 1,150 hectares are planted with vegetable. This municipality has been known as the “VEGETABLE BOWL OF THE NORTH”. The total value of vegetable production alone is PhP 523.04 million that brings a lot of income to farmers.\n\nThe farmers in the locality do not produce livestock or poultry in commercial scale but mostly on the backyard level. Livestock such as cows and water buffalo were being raised to help farmers in their farm needs and serves as working animal. Likewise goats were raised but not in herds and these are for local and home consumption of the farmers. Likewise farmers do not raise poultry in commercial scale but they raised chickens in backyard scale. Most farmers raised fighting cocks which commands higher prices in the market. The total area for fishponds is 53.9021 hectares. These fishponds are almost located in every barangay but the biggest area is at barangay Cabittaogan. Fishponds are classified as a) brackish pond where milkfish are cultured, b) freshwater for the production of tilapia, c) fish cages, d) Municipal fishing grounds which were found within 15 kilometers from the shoreline of coastal barangay and e) communal fishing grounds found in Govantes River.\n\nSanta Catalina also has manufacturing of concrete well rings-a material used as reservoir in the making of open-dugged wells to irrigate farm lots. There are also service-oriented industries such as gravel and sand businesses that cater to the needs of the Housing Sector and the metal crafts that manufacture sidecars for motorized-tricycles. These industries do have limited employment. One pioneering industry in the locality is the manufacture of Cigars but this industry is already nearing its extinction because of lack of the raw materials (native tobacco) that were used in the manufacture. We do have also the Onion Dehydration Plant an industry that pulverized onion that was exported in different Asian countries. The reason why this dehydrating plant had closed was because of dollar fluctuations.\n\nThe main source of income for the locals include farming, fishing and small-scale businesses. As with most Philippine towns, the phenomenon of migrant labor has also contributed much to the development of the town. It is evidenced by the numerous mansions and large houses that dot the area along with the vast expanse of active farms and fields. Santa Catalina is only four (4) kilometers away from Vigan City, which is the province's center of commerce and trade, and because of this; there are few establishments in the locality. Santa Catalina has yet to establish a Central Business District (CBD). Residents currently go to Vigan to sell their produce and at the same time buy their household needs and other goods and merchandise that will be retailed in the locality.\n\nIt has 7 elementary schools, namely:\n\nIt has two high schools, namely:\n\nMakati City, Philippines\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town is home to the Our Lady of the Assumption Church \"(Nuestra Señora de la Asuncion)\", a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The townspeople celebrate their patronal fiesta in honor of the Virgin Mary as Our Lady of the Assumption (more commonly known as \"Apo Baket\") every August 15 and lasting for several days.\n\nThe community of Santa Maria must have been already an organized settlement before the Spaniards came to the Philippines. When Captain Juan de Salcedo conquered the Ilocos in 1572, they found out that the people were already engaged in a brisk trade and commerce with the Japanese and the Chinese. The people's main industries were fishing and farming and to some extent weaving of cotton cloth and pottery. The people were noted for their religiosity. They worshiped the anitos, spirits and local Gods. Although the conquest of the Ilocos Region was a slow and painful process for the inhabitants resisted, they were later conquered through the use of the sword and hand in hand with the Cross. It was the religious nature of the people that the friars greatly exploited to convert the Ilocanos to the new faith – Christianity.\n\nIn 1572, Juan De Salcedo established an \"encomienda\" in Vigan as more places fell under the control of the Spaniards, more parishes or \"visitas\" (sub-parishes) were set up in place that could be easily serviced by the ecclesiastical and military officials. When Narvacan was created as a definitory by the Augustinians on April 25, 1567, its \"visitas\" were Santa Maria, San Esteban and Santiago. It is recorded that Narvacan was an \"encomienda\" of Don Nicolas de Figeroa in 1589; and left vacant in 1610. During this time, or a period later, Fr. Diego de Soria who later became bishop expanded the mission or religious control to the hinterlands - extending as far as Pangasinan and to the Cagayan Valley.\n\nIn the beginning, Santa Maria experienced hardships due to wars and other events. In 1638, the Chinese burnt the town and ten years later in 1660-1661, during the Andres Malong Revolt, the Zambals ransacked and looted at the same time killed some of the inhabitants of the town. Much of the church properties were carried away by the rebels. In 1762, the forces of Diego Silang, the leader of the Ilocos Revolt of 1762-1763 during the British Occupation, controlled the town of Santa Maria until Silang was assassinated in Bantay by his close friend, a mestizo named Miguel Vicos, in 1763.\n\nThere are conflicting dates regarding the establishment of this town as an independent parish or mission. The Catholic Directory of the Philippines as well as sources available at the Filipiniana Division of the National Library and National Archives show that the first Augustinian mission was established in Santa Maria in 1760. According to Reyes, Santa Maria was erected canonically in 1768; 1765 by Galende and Font; and 1769 by Buzeta, Bravo and Medina. It is likely that the town reverted to a \"visita\" of Narvacan for a period of time because of lacking a priest. In 1769, it was made again as an independent ministry under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Assumption in whose honor the name of the town was changed from Purok to Santa Maria. (The National Historical Commission of the Philippines placed the year as 1769, however, the people must have decided to have the foundation of Santa Maria as a separate in 1767 by basing their contention of the records that are still extent in Santa Maria. So that in 1967, the Santa Maria populace celebrated the 200th Anniversary of her Christianization.)\n\nFrom then on, Santa Maria progressed. During the second half of the eighteenth century, vigorous and active missions or “expeditions” were launched by the missionaries toward the hinterlands from Santa Maria. The Pilar district in Abra was a place where commercial dealings with the natives took place. Occasionally, the people of Pilar went down to the town of Santa Maria to market and in most \"visitas\", they were instructed into the faith, baptized or received the Holy Sacraments. (The Pilar district was a part of Ilocos Sur until the latter part of 1846, when it became part of Abra. It became a politico-military district later.) By 1800, the \"visitas\" of Santa Maria were San Esteban and Santiago. Fr. Bernardo Lago made it a religious center and converted thousands of its inhabitants to Christianity.\n\nThe following Augustinian missionaries are certain to have stayed in Santa Maria: Fr. Jose Laboza – 1769; Fr. Diego Sayar – 1773; Fr. Agustin Gomez- 1779; Fr. Manuel Silva- 1783-1785; (and who died there), Fr. Manuel Aparico – 1887; Fr. Exequiel Ortiz Lanzagorta – 1791 and who was secretary of the bishop of Nueva Segovia; and Fr. Alejandro Peyrona in 1786.\n\nSanta Maria's progress can be discerned from the growth of her population. In 1793, it had 834 inhabitants and ranked fifteenth as one of the most densely populated towns in the Ilocos. By 1803, it had 7,893 people.\n\nIn 1813, a priest by the name Fr. Juan Cardaño built the irrigation system by digging a canal to divert the river to water the rice fields. During the construction of the irrigation system, the inhabitants felt embittered by the enforced labor. In 1817, the town of Santa Maria was fenced under the direction of Fr. Cardaño who finished the work through use of forced labor on the inhabitants. Then men were later sent to cut lumber for the shipbuilding industry.\n\nBecause of the rapid progress of the Ilocos, the region was divided into Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur provinces, pursuant to the Real Cedula as of February 2, 1818. The population of Santa Maria decreased in 1820 due to the cholera epidemic. Except for periods when cholera or other natural calamities affected Santa Maria, its progress took an upward trend. As a result of its progress, Nueva Coveta, now Burgos, was separated from Santa Maria and established in 1831.\n\nIn 1850, Buzeta and Bravo describes the town of Santa Maria as follows:\n\nIn 1850, the town had some 1,983 houses constructed like most Philippine houses, some made of wood, most of bamboo and cogon grass. The more notable edifices were the tribunal, tile roofed and made of stone, on whose ground floor is the prison. This building is located in the plaza near the market place, where vegetables, eggs, meat and fish are sold. Sometimes itinerant mestizos sold merchandise there.\n\nIn front of the tribunal stood three private houses, also tile-roofed and made of stones, as well as two others, of the same material about to be finished. The town has a primary school maintained by the coffers of the town. Moreover, there are private schools for boys and girls.\n\nThe Church and tower are made of stone, and the sacristy, of stone and bricks. Near the house, atop a hill, is the convent of the parish house, which is equally imposing building. Down below, and 200 meters away, is the cemetery with its well-ventilated chapel, but which was destroyed by earthquake not long ago.\n\nIn Santa Maria, mail is received from the North (from Narvacan) every Tuesday morning and those from Manila, through Santiago every Thursday noon. The town consists of the barrios of Patac (Pacak), in the south, and those of San Gelacio, San Gregorio, and San Francisco which are close to the church (bajo de campana); farther away Tanggapan, Silas, Minorio, Bitalag, Gusing, Subsubosob, Dingtan, and Cabaritan, separated by wide fields but each of these barrios have only a few huts where the natives stay during harvest time.\n\nThe town has two ports: one in the west capable of handling big ships, the other in the north, which only handle smaller boats because of its narrow entrance but it can be widened to accommodate bigger ships as it did sometime in the past, when two full-rigged boats were constructed there.\n\nThe land is quite fertile, most of which is irrigated; thanks to the zeal of Fr. Juan Cardaño, present (1850) parish priest who, with the help of the colonial government was able to realize any improvements of the town, including the construction of the irrigation system, after six years of work. In 1804, when Cardaño took over the parish, the harvest were always in the danger of being lost due to the lack of irrigation, thus only 994 tributes (were paid); now 1850, 2,595 do so.\n\nTheir most important products are rice, wheat, cane and corn. Corn is abundant that it is exported to Santa, Bantay, Santa Catalina, San Vicente and many others. Oranges, santol and many kinds of bananas, pineapple, cacao are also grown in abundance.\n\nIn the mountains nearby, are different kinds of wood, like narra, molave, banaba, panurapin, bulala and others. Also found there, are chickens, deer and various varieties of birds. There is a gold mine in Pinsal, which is still to be exploited.\n\nThe inhabitants engaged in agriculture, lumbering and the women in weaving cotton cloth; some of which are sold in other places.\n\nBy this time in 1850, Santa Maria had a population of 11,900, up from 10,908 in 1845. By 1865, it was 12,059 and by 1880, 15,152 souls. There was a drought in 1878 followed by devastation of the fields by locusts and insects; and famine set in.\n\nIn 1881, embittered at the Spanish authorities due to the harsh treatment given them, the people stoned the tribunal and almost rose in arms against the Spaniards. During the great renovation of the convent in 1895, many of the inhabitants migrated to Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija to escape the forced labor and established a new community. Furthermore, the epidemics of cholera in 1881, 1883, and 1889 reduced greatly her population to 11,426 by 1892.\n\nDuring the Philippine revolution, Julian Directo became its first elected president in September 1898. The members of the Philippine Independent Church (PIC) took over the churches in Ilocos. It was an offshoot from the abuses of the friars and the effect of the revolution. The outbreak of the revolution further attributed to the decline of Santa Maria's inhabitants to 10,030 by 1901.\n\nSince the transfer of the Philippine sovereignty to the Americans in December 1898, many of the foreigners who traveled to the north and saw the Church of Santa Maria were much impressed and called the church as a Cathedral.Henry Savage Landor, an English painter, writer and explorer who visited the Philippines in 1900, says:\n\nAt Santa Maria a most picturesque church is to be found, reached on an imposing flight of steps. An enormous convent stands beside the church, upon a terrace some 80 feet above the plaza. There are a number of brick buildings, schoolhouses and office, which must have been very handsome but are tumbling down, the streets being in the absolute possession of sheeps, goats and hogs. A great expanse of level land was now well-cultivated into paddy fields and across it is a road fifteen feet wide, well-metalled and with a sandy surface. Barrios and homes were scattered all around the plain.\n\nWhen civil government was restored in Ilocos Sur under the American rule in 1901, Sinfroso Tamayo became its first president. According to some records, William Cameron Forbes, a member of the Taft Commission visited Santa Maria in 1901. A report in 1902 describes Santa Maria as town along the coast of Ilocos Sur, Luzon, (with) several cart roads that led to the interior; a city that built and by way of historical note, adds that on December 3, 1900, 2,150 insurgents surrendered here, (and) took oath of allegiance to the United States.\n\nThe Church of Santa Maria and other churches held by the PIC priests were returned to the administration of the Roman Catholic Church by the enactment of the Philippine Commission Act No. 1376 on July 24, 1905. (In spite of this major decision, the members of the Philippine Independent Church still hold their own in the Ilocos Region today.)\n\nIn 1902, another epidemic of cholera occurred followed by typhoid in 1909. Floods and typhoons added to the sufferings of the people in 1911 and 1913. These calamities greatly reduced the population and hindered the progress of Santa Maria. Many of the people after this period migrated to the central plains of Luzon, Mindanao and to as far as Hawaii and California in the United States of America.\n\nThe conditions in Santa Maria, however, has greatly changed fifty years later. The American Occupation had some beneficial effects as then roads, schools and better ways of farming were introduced in Santa Maria. A new generation became prominent who became new leaders in the present town of Santa Maria. In 1932, President Manuel Quezon visited Santa Maria on the occasion of his tour of Northern Luzon before the Commonwealth. After World War II, new buildings were built and churches were erected by the different religious as well as commercial and tourist spots developed.\nSituated at the western coastline of the island of Luzon, Santa Maria is nestled in a valley surrounded by mountains. It lies in the central part of the province of Ilocos Sur. Santa Maria is from Metro Manila and from Vigan City, the provincial capital.\n\nSanta Maria is politically subdivided into 33 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Santa Maria, Ilocos Sur, was people, with a density of .\n\nLocated in a fertile region with a cool tropical climate, the principal crops of Santa Maria are corn, cotton, indigo, rice, sugarcane and tobacco.\n\nSanta Maria's economy remained docile for almost four decades, subsisting only with fair performance in the aquaculture and agricultural ventures with no new developments in-place to create job opportunities in the commercial sector. Tourism industry's growth remains to be seen in the long-term. Industries relative interests to the town has to be developed and the corresponding infrastructure must be funded and implemented accordingly to create and sustain future development.\n\nSanta Maria is the Home of the First SM SaveMore Market in Ilocos Sur located in Barangay Maynganay Sur in front of the Santa Maria New Public Market.\n\nThe Church of Our Lady of the Assumption \"(Nuestra Señora de la Asuncion)\" (also known as the Santa Maria Church) in Santa Maria is a designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993 as part of the Baroque Churches of the Philippines collection of four Spanish-era churches.\n\nPinsal Falls, considered as the largest and grandest waterfalls in Ilocos Region, are located in a narrow gorge in Barangay Baballasioan of Santa Maria. Pinsal is a group of plunge and cascades waterfalls falling from a 300-ft wide irregular shaped river ledge the highest of which is a drop of about . Upriver are several smaller falls with their own natural pools. Behind the cascading water of the main falls is a hidden cave where one can swim from. Another tall waterfall is located at the southern ledge.\n\nThe grandeur and pristine beauty of these falls has long been attracting foreign and local tourists. Crystal clear water cascades down to two natural pools where visitors can frolic during hot summer. The surrounding hillsides are covered with verdant big trees making the place fairly cool. A trip to Pinsal Falls is not complete without climbing the carved steps to the top where more natural pools are found, the biggest of which is the 'footprint of Angalo'. According to the folklore, the ground indentation is the footprint the giant Angalo left behind while searching for his wife Aran. Another notable geographical feature is a phallic shaped rock, which the legend says belong to the male giant. Meters from this spot is the famous hot spring where one can boil an egg in 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nAdjacent to Pinsal falls are stones stairs carved out of the mountain to reach the upper falls. It is also used by the residents of the adjacent town of Pilar, Abra province in hiking to or from the Municipality of Santa Maria.\n\nPinsal Falls is located about on paved road from the municipal hall of Santa Maria via the Pinsal Falls Road, and can be reached in 20 minutes by any vehicular transportation .\n\nOn August 22, 2019, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11409 that declared the falls as a tourist destination, which will prioritize its development by the Department of Tourism.\n\nLocated in Barangay Baballasioan before Pinsal Falls. Similar to cable car the first in Ilocos Sur and the first in Ilocos Region. This facility is not functional, the machine used to rotate the steel rope up to the upper station was submerged by waters coming from the pinsal falls.

To do so, he asked for a leave of absence from his platoon leader to trace the source of the fruits. With his Ilocano guide, he searched the lands north of Villa Fernandina. He found nothing in the neighboring towns of Bantay, Santa Catalina, San Vicente, and Bantaoay (now San Ildefonso).

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nNestled near the Cordillera ranges, Sigay has crisp cool air and rustic scenery. Known to nature-lovers, adventurers, campers and mountaineers, the town attracts visitors with its version of the rice terraces, the Aw-asen Falls, the kilometric hanging bridge, and its picturesque rivers.\n\nNatives of the town claim that Sigay is as old as any other place in the province founded during the Spanish regime. But written records are yet to be found regarding its history. Oral tradition, however, has it that the name of the town originated from the ilocano term for fish trap, \"sigay\". The legend goes that, in the older times, Lake Ban-ao in Barangay Mabileg was once the village's most valuable source of fish. Around the area, one of the better-known fish species, the mudfish, apparently - in a fish trap, and brought the fish to the market. A Spaniard came along and asked where she got the fish. thinking that the stranger was asking about the gear she caught the fish with, she answered, \"Sigay\". It was by this incidence that the town started to be known by that name.\n\nAnother version of the etymology situates the legend in a setting when the \"sigay\" itself had to be re-invented for hunting. In those times, the village was still made up of \"tribu\" or tribes. As was the custom, each tribu chose a leader who ought to be the strongest, most fearless, and bravest in the clans. one of the leaders, and his hunters, loved to climb the mountains to hunt for food. Because it would then be easier to trap the animals in the forests, than run after them for the kill, the hunters devised a big net in the fashion of the \"sigay\" (fish trap/net). Hunting thus became much more uncomplicated. Because of the widespread use of the \"sigay\" both in the water and in the jungles, the lowland people who visited the place would eventually refer to it as Sigay.\n\nThe original settlers of Sigay were Igorots, or Pagans, who wandered from their ancestral lands in the Mountain Provinces north-westward to the Ilocos uplands. Many of them found a home in the mountains of Sigay. Years later, the natives' descendants made vows in marriage with pretty Ilocanas. Their offspring were born mestizos - fair skinned, red lipped, pink cheeked and brown haired - and became known as the \"New Ilocanos\". In the year 1700, when Christianity was introduced in the interior towns, baptized children were proclaimed as the \"New Christians\" or in Tagalog, the \"BAGO\". To this day, descendants of the Igorot natives, the Bago tribes continue to live in Sigay.\n\nThe Bago people are religious, thrifty, hospitable and cooperative. Although most of the area has been modernized, there are definite traces of the native customs and beliefs. For instance, to this day, the dance \"Tadek\" is performed during the wedding celebrations. In many sitios, the bayanihan spirit generally prevails, especially when building houses, or during the planting and harvest seasons. However, some of the older rituals like the Kanlaw are no longer performed, unless necessary.\n\nTo the Bagos of past years, the family was the basic unit of society, and the members were expected to work hand in hand to earn a living. The men, as head of the family, were usually the breadwinners. These days, however, owing perhaps to poverty, the wives are often seen helping their husbands earn money - whether in the farm, the forest, in the family business, or as government employees/workers, in order to make ends meet.\n\nThe people prefer a peaceful life to complexities; nonetheless they aspire for economic and infrastructure development in the municipality, especially the development of the main road that would connect them to the lowland urban centers, where they would sell their goods, and eventually be able to augment to the family income.\n\nMany members of the Bago tribe from Sigay ventured into the municipality of Tabuk - the capital town of what was then the province of Kalinga-Apayao - in the 1940s well into the 1950s. There, they found settlements which were then exclusively made up of settlers with Sigay origin - the most notable of which is the barangay of Casigayan (with the Sigay still kept in the name), which literally means \"a place of Sigay people.\"\n\nBy the time the Spaniards arrived in the northern part of the country, all the interior towns of Ilocos Sur were part of Montanosa or the Mountain Provinces. A sub-province of Montanosa was that of Amburayan, a prominent area of trade and commerce, which among others, included the towns of Gregorio del Pilar, Quirino, Cervantes, Lidlidda and San Emilio. Called after the vast Amburayan River that cascaded through it, and nurtured its fields, Amburayan was a vast stronghold of the natives; the river itself, fed by the springs from the mountains in the East, was wide, and foreign vessels used to dock there to trade with the natives. When the Spanish founded Ciudad Fernandina (Vigan), all the interior towns, Sigay included, were cut off Montanosa, and these became part of the Province of Ilocos Sur. The original inhabitants were natives and had the same facial features as the Igorots.\n\nAlthough already fully recognized by the Spanish Regime as a municipal district town in the 1800s, it was only in 1960 that Sigay emerged as a fully-fledged municipality, that which the residents called the New Era of Sigay. This came after the first elections of its local officials on November 12, 1959.\n\nToday, Sigay is composed of seven barangays: Mabileg, Poblacion, San Ramon, San Elias, Abaccan, Matallucod, and Santo Rosario. For a long time, the seat of local government resided in Abaccan. Later on, the local executive, Mayor Simeon Wandas (1960–1977) decided to build a Municipal Hall in Maday-aw (now, Poblacion) where, eventually, he transferred all the local government's occupations, including the Municipal Police Station.\n\nSigay is bordered on the north by the Municipality of Gregorio del Pilar, south by the Municipality of Suyo; east by the Municipality of Quirino, and west by the Municipality of Santa Cruz. Sigay can be reached one and a half hour ride from the City of Candon through strong-geared vehicles traversing 30 km, 22 km concrete and 8 km rugged roads, passing stony rivers crossing several times and going up through mountain terrains. During rainy season, the place is isolated by swollen rivers and muddy slippery roads. Residents adopt themselves by negotiating distances by hike.\n\nThe Municipality is nestled in a wide mountainous area where most of its forest is still untouched. Both ends of the Municipality is bounded with rivers namely Quinibor Rivers at the north, and Ida, Suyo Rivers in the south. Its type of soil is best suited to diversified crops.\n\nThe town has a total land area of 80.28 km. comprising seven barangays. The place has a vast mountain ranges and forest wherein bountiful forest products abound.\n\nSigay is politically subdivided into 7 barangays.\n\n\nThe climate pattern of Sigay has two pronounced season, wet and dry season. The type of season is very common not only in the nearby towns but in the entire region as well. The wet or rainy season is from the months of June to October and dry season is from the months November to May. The place is cold throughout the year due to the altitude of the town. The coldest months are from November to February.\n\nIn the , the population of Sigay was people, with a density of .\n\nThe municipality's population started a total number of eleven inhabitants during the 1930 National Census of Population, and gradually increased to 1,036 in the following years of census (1908 census) with a highest geometric growth rate in its history at 33.26% per year. This end dates back to the time when the Bago tribes still growing, as describe in the municipal legend. During those times only mountain trails to trek on, and the residents have abundant virgin resources abound. Perhaps, the first sixteen (16) years of relatively rapid population increase is a classic example of what geographic information about the land, and demography, for that matter would certainly bring to an upland municipality.\n\nThe language dialect used by the residents in the place is purely Ilocano, although many residents specially young can understand and speak English and Tagalog. The use of Filipino or Tagalog as a medium of instruction in the elementary school helps the children understand and speak the language.\n\nThere were many religious sects being practiced in this place. The Roman Catholic consists most in terms of the percentage of the population while the so-called Protestants were the United Church of Christ in the Philippines, The Way of Salvation, Seventh Day Adventist and the Assemblies of God and Jehovah's Witnesses.\nThe town of Sigay is predominantly an agricultural municipality. Though the area is rugged and mountainous, it has a wide level areas suited for agriculture. Most of the resident engaged and raised crops like tobacco, coffee which is their main products and primary source of livelihood.\n\nThe place has no public market up to the present so the residents need to transport their farm products to the lowlands for proper disposal and convert it into cash to buy their some basic needs especially during rainy season.\n\nSince most of the families, agriculture is their main source of income not only in this municipality. Indeed, the Department of Agriculture want to alleviate poverty, enhance income, profit and put into secured food sufficiency. To achieve these visions and aspirations, the department in consultation with our constituents at the grass roots level and other appropriate government agencies and offices, shall formulate and implement a medium and long term comprehensive Agriculture and Fishery Modernization Plan.\n\nThe municipality have seven schools including the Secondary School. There are two primaries which were situated at Barangay Mabileg and Barangay Matallucod while there were four elementary schools. One is Sigay Central School situated at Barangay San Ramon. Another is Abaccan Elementary School and the other two were San Elias Elementary School and Santo Rosario Elementary School. The secondary school is located at Poblacion which is now on its 8th year of operation. Because education is very important, the local officials strive more to provide school facilities and other needs to improve the newly established secondary school other than providing facilities, there are also employed teachers shouldered by the local funds to hep the school to its successful and continues operation.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is the northernmost municipality of the province and is from the provincial capital, Vigan, from Laoag, and from Manila.\n\nBecause of its main commodity, garlic, Sinait is also known as the Garlic Center of the North.\n\nBefore Magellan discovered the Philippines in 1521, the locality was only a small village of little over a hundred natives who were called \"Tirongs.\" By nature, these primitive inhabitants were sea-faring warlike. In their fast and picturesque sailboats, they traveled to adjoining and distant places, most particularly to settlements and villages along the Ilocos Coast in Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union, Pangasinan and even Zambales. In those adventures, the “Tirongs “ always challenged the people encountered to tribal wars and fought small battles against them. Often, those sturdy and brave natives came out victorious. Even in their daily chores, those people showed their ferocious characteristics. When the renowned Iberians came, Salcedo was sent to explore and colonized the Ilocos territory during the early years of the Spanish regime, he found the “Tirongs” of Sinait in apogee of the social state. Small battles were daily occurrence so that in the year 1535, when the locality was organized and established as a “Pueblo” Salcedo named the new community as “SIN-NAIT”, a word in the local tongue which means “CONTEST”. As a pueblo, SINAIT embraced and included in its territorial limit such as distant places as RANCHERA DE PAUR”, now the Municipality of Nueva Era in Ilocos Norte and Southern barrios of Badoc of the same Province. The vast territory, however, was reduced to present 78 square kilometers. In the year 1575, the natives fully realized the hardships of pronouncing the term “SIN-NAIT” and to go away with the trouble, Salcedo declared that one of the letter “N” be dropped. Since then, this Municipality has been called “SINAIT”. Nevertheless, it was only in 1913 when the same was “deeded” by the government upon the initiative of the late Don Calixto Cabacungan so that the Municipality Council enacted a resolution to that effect, that SINAIT was adopted as official name of the community to which said resolution was duly approved by the Provincial board of Ilocos Sur and by the Defunct Philippine Legislature.\n\nSinait houses the Sanctuary of the Miraculous Statue of the Black Nazarene (El Santo Cristo Milagroso), fondly called by its residents as \"Apo Lakay,\" and a treasure of Ilocandia. History traces the life-sized statue to Nagasaki, Japan. It was probably sent floating in the sea by missionaries operating in secret in Japan (for fear of persecution during the Tokugawa Bakufu). The box was found by local fishermen in the shores of Barangay Dadalaquiten Norte, on the boundary between Sinait and nearby Paguetpet (La Virgen Milagrosa), Badoc, in the year 1620, and fishermen from both towns carried it ashore. They found two statues inside the box—a statue of the Black Nazarene, and a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary. According to legend, The fishermen from Sinait mysteriously were unable to move the statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, but had no problems moving the Statue of the Black Nazarene. The fishermen from Badoc, however, were able to move the Statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary (later called the La Virgen Milagrosa) with ease, as they were unable to carry the image of the Black Nazarene. They took the statues to their respective towns, hence becoming their patron saints. In 1656, with a spreading devotion to the Santo Cristo Milagroso due to its miraculous powers, the Black Crucifix was taken to the capital town of Vigan, since an epidemic was raging there and through the devotion of the faithful, many got cured. Because of this, it is considered as an intercessor of all kinds of affliction and sickness. In 1660, because of the growing veneration to the image, the faithful begun the construction of a permanent edifice to house it. It took the people of Sinait eight years to construct the church with funds provides by the Spanish Audiencia. Today the landing site of Apo Lakay still exists in Barangay Dadalaquiten Norte, and is a place of pilgrimage for devotees.\n\nSinait is politically subdivided into 44 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Sinait was people, with a density of .\n\n\n"}

Henderson was dubbed the Butcher of Bahrain due to torture and the numerous human rights violations that were alleged to have taken place under his command there, especially during 1990s uprising in Bahrain.\n\nHenderson was born in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in 1927 but grew up among the Kikuyu in Kenya and lived most of his life overseas. He served as a Colonial Police Officer in Kenya during the 1950s and was famed for his role in capturing Mau Mau rebel leader Dedan Kimathi, which he wrote a book on, titled \"The Hunt for Kimathi\", also published under the title \"Man Hunt in Kenya\" by Doubleday. In 1954 Henderson was awarded the George Medal, the second-highest award for bravery not in combat, and later a bar to the George Medal, for suppressing the Mau Mau uprising. \"Ian Henderson has probably done more than any single individual to bring the Emergency to an end\" wrote General Sir Gerald Lathbury when he left Kenya in 1957. \n\nAfter independence, he was deported from Kenya and moved to Bahrain.

In 1996, Reid released a remixed version of the album, entitled \"The 12\" Mixes: An Album of the Very Best Club Remixes\". In the same year, Reid released the single \"Keep Pushing Our Love\" featuring soul singer Alysha Warren, which peaked at No. 30, intended to be the lead single from a second studio album. However, due to poor sales of the single, a second album never materialised.\n\nIn an attempt to revive Nightcrawlers, Reid released a single entitled \"Never Knew Love\" in 1999. However, it failed to achieve any commercial success and as such, no further releases appeared until 2004, when underground artists JCA and Rosabot released a collaborative remix single of Reid's hit \"Push The Feeling On\". It re-entered the U.S. Dance Chart, this time peaking at #1. Elated with the success of the remixes, Reid once again began recording material for a possible second album. In 2011, the first single from the second album, \"Cryin' Over You\", was released in the United Kingdom and Germany. It features vocals from British singer Taio Cruz.\n\nIn 2018, John Reid released an EP titled \"The Nightcrawlers Soul Sessions\".\n\nReid is a successful songwriter in his own right, having co-written a UK chart-topping single for Westlife (\"Unbreakable\"), Tina Turner's 1999 hit-single When the Heartache Is Over and also songs for Rod Stewart. He is a friend of Simon Cowell, and he co-wrote the Kelly Clarkson and Leona Lewis hit \"A Moment Like This\". He has worked as a songwriter for the Spanish singer Mónica Naranjo, with songs including \"No Voy A Llorar\", \"If You Leave Me Now\" and \"Hotline\", he also worked with Ian Levine, in \"Whenever You Need Someone\" (Bad Boys Inc), and tracks for Eternal, Gemini, Claire Richards for \"My Heart Is Heading Home (This Christmas)\" track and Optimystic. \n\nRoss Campbell is currently a lecturer at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.\n\n\n\n"}

His works, which are now lost, must have been considered very valuable by the ancients, since they refer to them very frequently; fragments of his work are preserved in various later authors.\n\nThe titles of Alexander's works are: \"A History of Beasts\" (), a long fragment of which, belonging to the second book, is quoted by Athenaeus.

{"id": "2068541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068541", "title": "Agoo", "text": "Agoo\n\n' (), officially the ', is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nAgoo is from Metro Manila and from San Fernando, the provincial capital.\n\nAgoo and La Union are part of the Ilocos Region, which is located on the narrow plain between the Cordillera Central and the West Philippine Sea. Agoo itself is one of the southern municipalities and is bounded on the north by Aringay, on the east by the municipality of Tubao further up the foothills of the Cordilleras, and on the south by Santo Tomas. Agoo's western shores consist of a long beach facing the West Philippine sea. \n\nThe Agoo River, which is sometimes wrongly named the Principe River after the Taytay Principe Bridge which traverses it along the main highway, flows through the town from uphill in the east to where it meets the West Philippine Sea in the west.\n\nThe name \"agoo\" is usually attributed to \"\"aroo\"\" or \"\"agoho\",\" a pine-like evergreen tree (Casuarina equisetifolia or Whistling Pine) that thrived in the western coast during the pre-Spanish Period.\n\nAgoo's administrative dates back further than most Philippine municipalities, with the town being established within the same decade that the Spanish colonizers arrived on the Island of Luzon. The history of the settlement now known as Agoo dates back even further, with both documentary and artifactual evidence supporting the assertion that it was a major port of call for foreign traders before it was formally established by the Spaniards.\n\nBefore the province of La Union was established, Agoo was part of Pangasinan, and was a settlement of people of the \"same race as those of Pangasinan.\" These people traded with Chinese merchants long before Columbus even sailed to the new world, as shown by the porcelain and pottery excavated from the site of the Catholic church during its renovation - now kept in the Museo de Iloko.\n\nLater, the Japanese came and established their first settlement in the Philippines. At this time, Agoo's coast was shaped in such a way that it was a good harbor for foreign vessels coming into Lingayen Gulf. \n\nIn 1572, Juan de Salcedo, fresh from his conquest of Southern Luzon, was ordered by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi to explore Northern Luzon and “pacify the people in it”.\n\nIn June 1572, he was traversing the Angalakan River, when he saw and attacked three Japanese ships. When they fled, Salcedo followed them until they landed at a Japanese settlement. After paying tributes, the Japanese were allowed to remain. These Japanese would leave when the port of Agoo was later closed, but not without first teaching the natives their methods of fish culture, rice cultivation, deerskin tanning, duck breeding, and weapons manufacturing.\n\nA permanent settlement was established in Agoo in 1578 when two Franciscan Missionaries, Fray Juan Bautista Lucarelli of Italy and Fray Sebastian de Baeza of Spain, constructed a thatch and bamboo church in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. Agoo encompassed a vast land area that spanned the modern day towns of Rosario, Santo Tomas, Tubao, Pugo, Aringay, Caba, Bauang and the place called \"Atuley\" or present day San Juan. Agoo became the center of the campaign of pacification and conquest, not only of the surrounding towns that would later become La Union, but of the mountain tribes in the Cordilleras as well.\n\nThe two missionaries formally proclaimed Agoo as a civic unit. naming it after the river along whose banks it was built. At the time, the riverbank was forested with pine-like trees locally called \"\"aroo\"\" or \"\"agoho\"\" (Casuarina equisetifolia, or Whistling Pine).\n\nIn another claim of the town's name origin, Agoo was said to be derived from a variety of flying fish (\"chileopogon agoo\"), thus \"agoo,\" by which Japanese settlers called it thereafter.\n\nDuring the early years of the Spanish colonial period, Agoo continued to be an important point of trade with Japan. Miguel De Loarca referred to Agoo as “El Puerto de Japon” - the Japanese Port.\n\nRosario Mendoza-Cortes, in her book \"Pangasinan 1572-1800\" notes that Agoo was the region's primary port of call for Japanese and Chinese traders - with the only other contender for the honor being Sual, Pangasinan. This was because there was a Japanese colony there, because traders at Agoo would have access to a greater number of people, and it was nearer to China and Japan. The main product traded from the area was deer pelt, which was shipped to Japan.\n\nAgoo's role as a port deteriorated when the Spanish closed the Philippines to foreign trade. When foreign trade was allowed again, the shape of the gulf had changed and it was thus Sual that became the dominant port.\n\nMost of the town's early development can be attributed to the efforts of the Augustinian Order. They took over from the Franciscans and administered the town off and on throughout the Spanish occupation until the secular priests took over in 1898.\n\nThey changed the town's patron saint to Santa Monica. They established a school where reading, writing, industrial works, and catechism were taught. They relocated the town center, laid out the streets and public buildings, and established roads leading to the nearby towns.\n\nTo facilitate the construction of churches, public buildings and bridges, they taught the people brick and lime making, brick-laying, and stone-quarrying. They introduced the “moro-moro”, the singing of “pasyon”, new farm implement and new plants.\n\nFather Aquilino Garcia constructed a church, and by the end of the 15th century the image of \"Nuestra Señora de Caridad\" (Our Lady of Charity) was installed in it. This church was destroyed in 1796 and a new one was built when the original settlement was moved to what has ever since been the town center. The church was then claimed to be the largest and grandest in northern Luzon during that time. Ruins are scattered althroughout the town's center and some are visible at this point of time.\n\nIn 1661, Andres Malong of Pangasinan failed to recover La Union from the Spaniards after the Battle of Agoo.\n\nOn October 29, 1849, Governor General Claveria issued a \"promovido\" to fuse the Pangasinan-Ilocos-Cordillera areas into \"La Union\". On March 2, 1850, Governor General Antonio Maria Blanco signed the Superior Decreto of La Union (34th province from Cebu-1565), with Captain Toribio Ruiz de la Escalera as the first Gobernador Military y Politico. Isabella II of Spain decreed the province's creation on April 18, 1854.\n\nThe new province comprised the north-western towns of Pangasinan and the towns of Ilocos Sur south of the Amburayan river. Agoo was the oldest town to be integrated and was listed as having a population of 6,936 people.\n\nIn the early morning of 22 December 1941, Agoo was one of three beachheads taken by the invasion force of General Masaharu Homma during the Japanese Invasion of Lingayen Gulf.\n\nThe Japanese' 47th Infantry Regiment under the command of Col Isamu Yanagi, accompanied by the 4th Tank Regiment and supported by a flotilla of the Imperial Japanese Navy led by Vice Admiral Kenzaburo Hara (consisting of the light cruiser , destroyers , , , , , , three minesweepers, six anti-submarine craft and six transports) was supposed to land on the beaches of Agoo beginning 5:00 A.M. on December 22 1941, having left Takao on Taiwan the evening of December 18. \n\nThe Japanese 47th Infantry and 4th Tank Regiment were confronted by heavy weather, however, and were thus delayed and dispersed. They landed at about 7:30 A.M. on a four-mile stretch of beach all the way from Agoo to just north of Damortis. \n\nAgoo is thus recorded in WWII annals as one of the Japanese staging points for the Battle of Rosario.\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos' 1972 declaration of martial law had little political effect within Agoo itself, although there were some Agoo natives, such as then-Davao Archbishop Antonio L. Mabutas, who spoke against the human rights abuses during martial law.\n\nMarcos had strong political ties to La Union, notably Jose D. Aspiras whom he appointed as Tourism Minister. He also allowed the powerful family factions which had dominated La Union politics since before the American colonial era to stay in place. Marcos' efforts to consolidate political power did not get much resistance in the La Union, including Agoo, since Marcos' use of violent methods for stifling dissent thus mostly took place in other, non-Ilocano provinces, such as nearby Abra, Kalinga, and Mountain Province.\n\nSince Bishop Mabutas was in Davao at the time, though, he was aware of human rights abuses in that city, particulaly the torture and killings of church workers. The pastoral letter he wrote against Martial law, “Reign of Terror in the Countryside,” is notable for having been the first pastoral to be written against Marcos' martial law administration.\n\nOn July 23, 1945 the Municipal government, then led by Mayor Miguel Fontanilla, established South Provincial High School in response to education-oriented citizen Ramon Mabutas' calls for the establishment of a public high school. South Provincial High School turned Agoo into a center of education for Southern La Union, and became one of the constituent state-run schools that were combined by Presidential Decree 1778 in order to create the Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University in 1981.\n\nAfter the February 1986 People Power Revolution, President Corazon Aquino placed the Philippines under a revolutionary government until the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines could be ratified. During this time, the Municipality of Agoo was placed under the administration of OIC Mayor Antonio Q. Estrada.\n\nAt 4.26 P.M. on July 16, 1990, Agoo was hit by the 1990 Luzon earthquake, and was one of the most severely affected locales.\n\nThe Basilica Minore of Our Lady of Charity was badly damaged, and the bell tower which was then the only remaining structure from the 1893 church, crashed completely. The Agoo municipal building collapsed completely, killing numerous citizens who were inside because they were in line to pay in time for the national income tax deadline for that quarter. Numerous tombs in the municipal cemetery were fractured open.\n\nThe town gained media attention in the early 1990s for the alleged Marian apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary to Judiel Nieva. Nieva reported seeing the Virgin Mary, popularly known as \"Our Lady of Agoo\" atop a Guava tree, a statue weeping with blood became highly sensationalized. Religious pilgrimages among Filipino Catholics increased by the millions as people flocked to see the phenomenon. The alleged apparition and healing events came into the attention of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, who in turn began an investigation and later released an ecclesiastical ruling that the apparitions were \"non-supernatural in origin\" in 1993.\n\nSince 2010, either the Municipality Agoo has been regularly declared an election hotspot due to incidences of violence during national and local election periods. Major incidents include the murder of former Tubao Vice Mayor Lazaro Gayo outside his law office near Agoo's Municipal Hall, and an alleged assassination attempt on Tubao Mayor Dante Garcia in the same year; and an alleged assassination attempt on former Congressman Eufranio Eriguel in 2016.\n\nMedia attributed the violence to \"intense rivalry\" between incumbent Congressman Eufranio Eriguel and his 2010 opposing candidate, former Rep. Thomas Dumpit Jr., and later to \"clashes between the followers\" of Congressman Eriguel and his 2013 opponent, former Army General Mario Chan.\n\nIn 2013, the declaration of the towns Tubao, Agoo, Caba, and Aringay as election hotspots compelled the Philippine National Police to temporarily remove the police chiefs of the four towns during the election period, a decision which was protested by incumbent politicians in both towns, including then-Congressman Eriguel and his wife, then-Mayor Sandra Eriguel.\n\nAlso during the 2010s, a number of drug-related incidents in Agoo came to national attention. This resulted in the sacking of the police chief of Agoo, along with those of the Southern La Union towns of Bauang, Naguilan, and Tubao.\n\nOn August 16, 2016, former Congressman Eriguel was included by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte as one of the local government officials and legislators allegedly involved in illegal drug trade in his \"\"I am sorry for my country\"\" speech. Eriguel and a number of other Southern La Union politicians denied these allegations.\n\nOn June 11, 2014 then-representative Eufranio Eriguel filed House Bill 4644 to establish the first city in the second district by merging the municipalities of Agoo and Aringay. The bill was co-authored by La Union first district Rep. Victor Ortega and Abono party-list Rep. Francisco Emmanuelle Ortega III, and was deemed necessary because neither Aringay nor Agoo alone could meet the requirements to create a Philippine city: a population of 150,000; an annual income of P100 million minimum a year; and a land area of 100 square kilometers. (As of 2014, the national census showed that Agoo and Aringay have about 65,000 and 47,500 residents, respectively. Agoo posted more than P90 million, and Aringay made P15,000 million in annual earnings, respectively)\n\nThe proposed city would have two districts under a city mayor and city vice mayor along with 14 councilors in the Sangguniang Panlungsod, new positions for which the former municipal officials could run despite having the terms limits of their offices.\n\nThe proposed bill sparked protests from the people of both Agoo and Aringay who did not want the merger because it would subject them to the same high local taxes as Agoo, because the people of Agoo don't want their area to expand too much, and because of concerns that Agoo and Aringay would lose their cultural identities. The proposed merger did not push through within term of the 16th congress.\n\nAccording to findings of the Philippine Rice Research Institute, Agoo's land consists mostly of the San Manuel, Maligaya, Annam, and Bauang type soils.\n\nAgoo is divided into 49 barangays.\nIn the , the population of Agoo was people, with a density of .\n\nJust as the national government, the municipal government of Agoo, is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judiciary. The judicial branch is administered solely by the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The LGUs have control of the executive and legislative branch.\n\nThe executive branch is composed of the mayor and the barangay captain for the barangays.Local Government Code of the Philippines, Book III, Department of Interior and Local Government official website.\n\nThe legislative branch is composed of the Sangguniang Bayan (town assembly), Sangguniang Barangay (barangay council), and the Sangguniang Kabataan for the youth sector.\n\nThe seat of Government is vested upon the Mayor and other elected officers who hold office at the Town hall. The Sanguniang Bayan is the center of legislation, stationed in Agoo Municipio.\n\n\nAgoo has interesting attractions and main festival/events:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2068545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068545", "title": "Peace dollar", "text": "Peace dollar\n\nThe Peace dollar is a United States dollar coin minted from 1921 to 1928, and again in 1934 and 1935. Designed by Anthony de Francisci, the coin was the result of a competition to find designs emblematic of peace. Its obverse represents the head and neck of the Goddess of Liberty in profile, and the reverse depicts a bald eagle at rest clutching an olive branch, with the legend \"Peace\". It was the last United States dollar coin to be struck for circulation in silver.\n\nWith the passage of the Pittman Act in 1918, the United States Mint was required to strike millions of silver dollars, and began to do so in 1921, using the Morgan dollar design. Numismatists began to lobby the Mint to issue a coin that memorialized the peace following World War I; although they failed to get Congress to pass a bill requiring the redesign, they were able to persuade government officials to take action. The Peace dollar was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon in December 1921, completing the redesign of United States coinage that had begun in 1907.\n\nThe public believed the announced design, which included a broken sword, was illustrative of defeat, and the Mint hastily acted to remove the sword. The Peace dollar was first struck on December 28, 1921; just over a million were coined bearing a 1921 date. When the Pittman Act requirements were met in 1928, the mint ceased production of the coins, but more were struck during 1934 and 1935 as a result of further legislation. In 1965, amid much controversy, the Denver mint struck over 316,000 Peace dollars dated 1964, but these were never issued, and all are believed to have been melted.\n\nThe Bland–Allison Act, passed by Congress on February 28, 1878, required the Treasury to purchase a minimum of $2 million in domestically mined silver per month and coin it into silver dollars. The Mint used a new design by engraver George T. Morgan, and struck what became known as the Morgan dollar. Many of the pieces quickly vanished into bank vaults for use as backing for paper currency redeemable in silver coin, known as silver certificates. In 1890, the purchases required under the Bland–Allison Act were greatly increased under the terms of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Although the Sherman Act was repealed in 1893, it was not until 1904 that the government struck the last of the purchased silver into dollars. Once it did, production of the coin ceased.\n\nDuring World War I, the German government hoped to destabilize British rule over India by spreading rumors that the British were unable to redeem for silver all of the paper currency they had printed. These rumors, and hoarding of silver, caused the price of silver to rise and risked damaging the British war effort. The British turned to their war ally, the United States, asking to purchase silver to increase the supply and lower the price. In response, Congress passed the Pittman Act of April 23, 1918. This statute gave the United States authority to sell metal to the British government from up to 350,000,000 silver dollars at $1 per ounce of silver plus the value of the copper in the coins, and handling and transportation fees. Only 270,232,722 coins were melted for sale to the British, but this represented 47% of all Morgan dollars struck to that point. The Treasury was required by the terms of the Act to strike new silver dollars to replace the coins that were melted, and to strike them from silver purchased from American mining companies.\n\nIt is uncertain who originated the idea for a US coin to commemorate the peace following World War I; the genesis is usually traced to an article by Frank Duffield published in the November 1918 issue of \"The Numismatist\". Duffield suggested that a victory coin should be \"issued in such quantities it will never become rare\". In August 1920, a paper by numismatist Farran Zerbe was read to that year's American Numismatic Association (ANA) convention in Chicago. In the paper, entitled \"Commemorate the Peace with a Coin for Circulation\", Zerbe called for the issuance of a coin to celebrate peace, stating,\n\nZerbe's proposal led to the appointment of a committee to transmit the proposal to Congress and urge its adoption. According to numismatic historian Walter Breen, \"Apparently, this was the first time that a coin collector ever wielded enough political clout to influence not only the Bureau of the Mint, but Congress as well.\" The committee included noted coin collector and Congressman William A. Ashbrook (Democrat–Ohio), who had chaired the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures until the Republicans gained control following the 1918 elections.\n\nAshbrook was defeated for re-election in the 1920 elections; at that time congressional terms did not end until March 4 of the following year. He was friendly with the new committee chairman Albert Henry Vestal (Republican–Indiana), and persuaded him to schedule a hearing on the peace coin proposal for December 14, 1920. Though no bill was put before it, the committee heard from the ANA delegates, discussed the matter, and favored the use of the silver dollar, which as a large coin had the most room for an artistic design. The committee took no immediate action; in March 1921, after the Harding administration took office, Vestal met with the new Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew W. Mellon, and Mint Director Raymond T. Baker about the matter, finding them supportive so long as the redesign involved no expense.\n\nOn May 9, 1921, striking of the Morgan dollar resumed at the Philadelphia Mint under the recoinage called for by the Pittman Act. The same day, Congressman Vestal introduced the Peace dollar authorization bill as a joint resolution. Vestal placed his bill on the Unanimous Consent Calendar, but Congress adjourned for a lengthy recess without taking any action. When Congress returned, Vestal asked for unanimous consent that the bill pass on August 1, 1921. However, one representative, former Republican leader James R. Mann (Illinois) objected, and numismatic historian Roger Burdette suggests that Mann's stature in the House ensured that the bill would not pass. Nevertheless, Vestal met with the ANA and told them that he hoped Congress would reconsider when it met again in December 1921.\n\nSometime after the December 1920 hearing requested by the ANA, the chairman of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, Charles Moore, became aware of the proposed congressional action, and decided to investigate. Moore, together with Commission member and Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, met with Mint Director Baker on May 26, 1921, and they agreed that it would be appropriate to hold a design competition for the proposed dollar, under the auspices of the Commission. This was formalized on July 26 with the Commission's written recommendation to the Mint that a competition, open only to invited sculptors, be used to select designs. The winner of the competition was to receive $1,500 prize money, while all other participants would be given $100. On July 28, President Harding issued Executive Order 3524, requiring that coin designs be submitted to the Commission before approval by the Treasury Secretary. In early September, following the failure of the bill, Baker contacted Moore, putting the matter aside pending congressional action.\n\nBy November, proponents of the peace coin had realized that congressional approval was not necessary—as the Morgan dollar had been struck for more than 25 years, it was eligible for replacement at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury under an 1890 act. The Morgan design was then being used for large quantities of silver dollars as the Mint struck replacements for the melted coins under the Pittman Act. Though Congress had not yet convened, Baker contacted Fraser in early November to discuss details of the design competition. According to Burdette, Baker's newfound enthusiasm came from the fact that President Harding was about to formally declare an end to the war with Germany—a declaration needed because the US had not ratified the Treaty of Versailles. In addition, the Washington Conference on disarmament, for which the administration had great hopes, was soon to convene. On November 19, Fraser notified competition participants by personal letter, sending official rules and requirements four days later, with submissions due by December 12. Competition participants included Hermon MacNeil, Victor D. Brenner, and Adolph Weinman, all of whom had designed previous U.S. coins.\n\nThe artists were instructed to depict the head of Liberty on the obverse, to be made \"as beautiful and full of character as possible\". The reverse would depict an eagle, as prescribed by the Coinage Act of 1792, but otherwise was left to the discretion of the artist. The piece also had to bear the denomination, the name of the country, \"E pluribus unum\", the motto \"In God We Trust\", and the word \"Liberty\".\n\nOn December 13, the commission assembled to review the submitted designs, as well as a set produced by Mint Chief Engraver Morgan at Baker's request, and a set, unrequested, from a Mr. Folio of New York City. It is not known how the designs were displayed for the Commission. After considerable discussion among Fraser, Moore, and Herbert Adams (a sculptor and former member of the Commission), a design by Anthony de Francisci was unanimously selected.\n\nAt age 34, de Francisci was the youngest of the competitors; he was also among the least experienced in the realm of coin design. While most of the others had designed regular or commemorative coins for the Mint, de Francisci's sole effort had been the conversion of drawings for the 1920 Maine commemorative half dollar to the finished design. De Francisci had had little discretion in that project, and later said of the work, \"I do not consider it very favorably.\"\n\nThe sculptor based the obverse design of Liberty on the features of his wife, Teresa de Francisci. Due to the short length of the competition, he lacked the time to hire a model with the features he envisioned. Teresa de Francisci was born Teresa Cafarelli in Naples, Italy. In interviews, she related that when she was five years old and the steamer on which she and her family were immigrating passed the Statue of Liberty, she was fascinated by the statue, called her family over, and struck a pose in imitation. She later wrote to her brother Rocco,\n\nBreen wrote that the radiate crown that the Liberty head bears is not dissimilar to those on certain Roman coins, but is \"more explicitly intended to recall that on the Statue of Liberty\". Anthony de Francisci recalled that he opened the window of the studio and let the wind blow on his wife's hair as he worked. However, he did not feel that the design depicted her exclusively. He noted that \"the nose, the fullness of the mouth are much like my wife's, although the whole face has been elongated\". De Francisci submitted two reverse designs; one showed a warlike eagle, aggressively breaking a sword; the other an eagle at rest, holding an olive branch. The latter design, which would form the basis for the reverse of the Peace dollar, recalled de Francisci's failed entry for the Verdun City medal. The submitted obverse is almost identical to the coin as struck, excepting certain details of the face, and that the submitted design used Roman rather than Arabic numerals for the date.\n\nBaker, de Francisci, and Moore met in Washington on December 15. At that time, Baker, who hoped to start Peace dollar production in 1921, outlined the tight schedule for this to be accomplished, and requested certain design changes. Among these was the inclusion of the broken sword from the sculptor's alternate reverse design, to be placed under the eagle, on the mountaintop on which it stands, in addition to the olive branch. Baker approved the designs, subject to these changes. The revised designs were presented to President Harding on December 19. Harding insisted on the removal of a small feature of Liberty's face, which seemed to him to suggest a dimple, something he did not consider suggestive of peace, and the sculptor then did so.\n\nThe Treasury announced the new design on December 19, 1921. Photographs of Baker and de Francisci examining the final plaster model appeared in newspapers, along with written descriptions of the designs, since the Treasury at that time took the position that it was illegal for photographs of a United States coin to be printed in a newspaper. Secretary Mellon gave formal approval to the design on December 20. As it would take the Mint several days to produce working dies, the first strike of the new coins was scheduled for December 29.\n\nThe new design was widely reported in newspapers, and was the source of intense public attention. A Mint press release described the reverse as \"a large figure of an eagle perched on a broken sword, and clutching an olive branch bearing the word, 'peace. On December 21, the \"New York Herald\" ran a scathing editorial against the new design,\n\nAt the time, according to Burdette, given the traumas of the Great War, Americans were highly sensitive about their national symbols, and unwilling to allow artists any leeway in interpretation. The Mint, the Treasury, and the Fine Arts Commission began to receive large numbers of letters from the public objecting to the design. De Francisci attempted to defend his design, stating, \"with the sword there is the olive branch of peace and the combination of the two renders it impossible to conceive of the sword as a symbolization of defeat\". Baker had left Washington to visit the San Francisco Mint, a transcontinental journey of three days. Acting Mint Director Mary Margaret O'Reilly sent him a telegram on December 23, urgently seeking his approval to remove the sword from the reverse, as had been recommended by Moore and Fraser at a meeting the previous afternoon. Due to the tight timeline for 1921 strikings of the dollar, it was not possible to await Baker's response, so on the authority of Treasury Undersecretary Seymour Parker Gilbert, who was approached by O'Reilly, the Mint proceeded with the redesign. To satisfy Harding's executive order, the Fine Arts Commission quickly approved the change, and by the time Baker wired his approval on December 24, without being able to see the revisions, Gilbert had already approved the revised design in Secretary Mellon's absence. A press release was issued late on December 24, stating that the broken sword which had appeared on de Francisci's alternate reverse would not appear on the issued coin. In its December 25 edition, the \"Herald\" took full credit for the deletion of the broken sword from the coin's design.\n\nFarran Zerbe, whose paper to the ANA convention helped launch the dollar proposal, saw de Francisci's defense and the press release, and suggested that the sculptor had mistakenly thought his alternate design had been approved.\n\nThe removal of the sword from the coinage hub, which had already been produced by reduction from the plaster models, was accomplished by painstaking work by Mint Chief Engraver Morgan, using extremely fine engraving tools under magnification. Morgan did the work on December 23 in the presence of de Francisci, who had been summoned to the Philadelphia Mint to ensure the work met with his approval. It was insufficient merely to remove the sword, as the rest of the design had to be adjusted. Morgan had to hide the excision; he did so by extending the olive branch, previously half-hidden by the sword, but had to remove a small length of stem that showed to the left of the eagle's talons. Morgan also strengthened the rays, and sharpened the appearance of the eagle's leg. The chief engraver did his work with such skill that the work on the dollar was not known for over 85 years.\n\nOn December 28, Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Freas Styer wired Baker in San Francisco, reporting the first striking of the Peace dollar. The Mint later reported that 1,006,473 pieces were struck in 1921, a rate of output for the four days remaining in the year that Burdette calls \"amazing\"; he speculates that minting of 1921 Peace dollars continued into 1922. The first coin struck was to be sent to President Harding, but what became of it is something of a mystery: O'Reilly indicated that she had the coin sent to Harding, but the inventory of Harding's estate, prepared after the President died in office less than two years later, does not mention it, nor is there any mention of the coin in Harding's papers. Breen, in his earlier book on U.S. coins, stated that the coin was delivered to Harding by messenger on January 3, 1922, but does not state the source of his information. A few proofs of the 1921 production were struck early in the run, in both satin and matte finishes, but it is unknown exactly how many with either finish were created; numismatic historians Leroy Van Allen and A. George Mallis estimate the mintage totals at 24 of the former and five of the latter.\n\nThe Peace dollar was released into circulation on January 3, 1922. In common with all silver and copper-nickel dollar coins struck from 1840 to 1978, the Peace dollar had a diameter of , which was larger than the Mint's subsequently struck modern dollar coins. Its issuance completed the redesign of United States coinage that had begun with issues in 1907. Long lines formed at the Sub-Treasury Building in New York the following day when that city's Federal Reserve Bank received a shipment; the 75,000 coins initially sent by the Mint were \"practically exhausted\" by the end of the day. Rumors that the coins did not stack well were contradicted by bank cashiers, who demonstrated for \"The New York Times\" that the coins stacked about as well as the Morgan dollars. De Francisci had paid Morgan for 50 of the new dollars; on January 3, Morgan sent him the pieces. According to his wife, de Francisci had bet several people that he would lose the design competition; he used the pieces to pay off the bets and did not keep any.\n\nAccording to one Philadelphia newspaper,\n\nFrom the start, the Mint found that excessive pressure had to be applied to fully bring out the design of the coin, and the dies broke rapidly. On January 10, 1922, O'Reilly, still serving as Acting Mint Director in Baker's absence, ordered production of the dollar stopped. Dies had been sent to the Denver and San Francisco mints in anticipation of beginning coinage there; they were ordered not to begin work until the difficulties had been resolved. The Commission of Fine Arts was asked to advise what changes might solve the problems. Both Fraser and de Francisci were called to Philadelphia, and after repeated attempts to solve the problem without reducing the relief failed, de Francisci agreed to modify his design to reduce the relief. The plaster models he prepared were reduced to coin size using the Mint's Janvier reducing lathe. However, even after 15 years of possessing the pantograph-like device, the Mint had no expert in its use on its staff, and, according to Burdette, \"[h]ad a technician from Tiffany's or Medallic Art [Company] been called in, the 1922 low relief coins might have turned out noticeably better than they did\".\n\nApproximately 32,400 coins on which Morgan had tried to keep a higher relief were struck in January 1922. While all were believed to have been melted, one circulated example has surfaced. Also, high relief 1922 proof dollars occasionally appear on the market and it is believed that about six to 10 of them exist. The new low-relief coins, which Fraser accepted on behalf of the Commission, though under protest, were given limited production runs in Philadelphia in early February. When the results proved satisfactory, San Francisco began striking its first Peace dollars using the low-relief design on February 13, with Denver initiating production on February 21, and Philadelphia on February 23. The three mints together struck over 84 million pieces in 1922.\n\nThe 1926 Peace dollar, from all mints, has on the obverse the word \"God\", slightly boldened. The Peace dollar's lettering tended to strike indistinctly, and Burdette suggests that the new chief engraver, John R. Sinnock (who succeeded Morgan after his death in 1925), may have begun work in the middle of the motto \"In God We Trust\", and for reasons unknown, only the one word was boldened. No Mint records mention the matter, which was not discovered until 1999.\n\nThe Peace dollar circulated mainly in the Western United States, where coins were preferred over paper money, and saw little circulation elsewhere. Aside from this use, the coins were retained in vaults as part of bank reserves. They would frequently be obtained from banks as Christmas presents, with most deposited again in January. With the last of the Pittman Act silver struck into coins in 1928, the Mint ceased the production of Peace dollars.\n\nProduction of Peace dollars resumed in 1934, due to another congressional act; this one requiring the Mint to purchase large quantities of domestic silver, a commodity whose price was at a historic low. This Act assured producers of a ready market for their product, with the Mint gaining a large profit in seigniorage, through monetizing cheaply purchased silver—the Mint in fact paid for some shipments of silver bullion in silver dollars. Pursuant to this authorization, over seven million silver Peace dollars were struck in 1934 and 1935. Mint officials gave consideration to striking 1936 silver dollars, and in fact prepared working dies, but as there was no commercial demand for them, none were actually struck. With Mint Chief Engraver Sinnock thinking it unlikely that there would be future demand for the denomination, the master dies were ordered destroyed in January 1937.\n\nOn August 3, 1964, Congress passed legislation providing for the striking of 45,000,000 silver dollars. Silver coins, including the dollar, had become scarce due to hoarding as the price of silver rose past the point at which a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as currency. The new coins were intended to be used at Nevada casinos and elsewhere in the West where \"hard money\" was popular. Many in the numismatic press complained that the new silver dollars would only satisfy a small special interest, and would do nothing to alleviate the general coin shortage. Much of the pressure for the coins to be struck was being applied by the Senate Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield (Democrat–Montana), who represented a state that heavily used silver dollars. Preparations for the striking proceeded at a reluctant Mint Bureau. Some working dies had survived Sinnock's 1937 destruction order, but were found to be in poor condition, and Mint Assistant Engraver (later Chief Engraver) Frank Gasparro was authorized to produce new ones. Mint officials had also considered using the Morgan Dollar design; this idea was dropped and Gasparro replicated the Peace dollar dies. The reverse dies all bore Denver mintmarks; as the coins were slated for circulation in the West, it was deemed logical to strike them nearby.\n\nTreasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon was opposed to restriking the Peace dollar and in early 1965 informed President Lyndon Johnson that such coins would be unlikely to circulate in Montana, nor anywhere else; they would simply be hoarded. Nevertheless, Dillon concluded that as Senator Mansfield insisted, they would have to be struck. Dillon resigned on April 1; his successor, Henry H. Fowler, was immediately questioned by Mansfield about the dollars, and he assured the senator that things would be worked out to his satisfaction. Mint Director Eva Adams was also against striking the silver dollars, but hoped to keep the $600,000 appropriated for that expense. Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or delay and on May 12, 1965, the Denver Mint began trial strikes of the 1964-D Peace dollar—the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.\n\nThe new pieces were publicly announced on May 15, 1965, and coin dealers immediately offered $7.50 each for them, ensuring that they would not circulate. The public announcement prompted a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources during a severe coin shortage, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams suddenly announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 dollars had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure that there would be no repetition, Congress inserted a provision in the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. No 1964-D Peace dollars are known to exist in either public or private hands. in 1970, two unknown specimens were discovered in a Treasury vault and were immediately destroyed. Rumors and speculation about others surviving in illegal private possession immediately began and continue to appear from time to time. Pieces appearing to be 1964-D dollars have also been privately restruck using unofficial dies and genuine, earlier-date Peace dollars.\n\nSome Peace dollars using an experimental base metal composition were struck in 1970 in anticipation of the approval of the Eisenhower dollar; they are all presumed destroyed. This new dollar coin was approved by an act signed by President Richard Nixon on December 31, 1970, with the obverse to depict President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had died in March, 1969. Circulating Eisenhower dollars contained no precious metal, though some for collectors were struck in 40% silver.\n\nNone of the Peace dollar mintages are particularly rare, and A Guide Book of United States Coins (or Red Book) lists low-grade circulated specimens for most years for little more than the coin's bullion value. Two exceptions are the first year of issue 1921 Peace dollar, minted only at the Philadelphia mint and issued in high relief, and the low-mintage 1928-P Peace dollar. The prices for the 1928-P dollar are much lower than its mintage of 360,649 would suggest, because the U.S. mint announced that limited quantities would be produced and many were saved. In contrast the 1934-S dollar was not saved in great numbers so that prices for circulated specimens are fairly inexpensive but mid-grade uncirculated specimens can cost thousands of dollars.\n\nBibliography\n\nOther sources\n\n"}

{"id": "2068555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068555", "title": "Morgan dollar", "text": "Morgan dollar\n\nThe Morgan dollar was a United States dollar coin minted from 1878 to 1904, and again in 1921. It was the first standard silver dollar minted since production of the previous design, the Seated Liberty dollar, ceased due to the passage of the Coinage Act of 1873, which also ended the free coining of silver. The coin is named after its designer, United States Mint Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan. The obverse depicts a profile portrait representing Liberty, while the reverse depicts an eagle with wings outstretched. The mint mark, if present, appears on the reverse above the \"o\" in \"Dollar\".\n\nThe dollar was authorized by the Bland–Allison Act. Following the passage of the 1873 act, mining interests lobbied to restore free silver, which would require the Mint to accept all silver presented to it and return it, struck into coin. Instead, the Bland–Allison Act was passed, which required the Treasury to purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver at market value to be coined into dollars each month. In 1890, the Bland–Allison Act was repealed by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which required the Treasury to purchase of silver each month, but only required further silver dollar production for one year. This act, once again, was repealed in 1893.\n\nIn 1898, Congress approved a bill that required all remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act to be coined into silver dollars. When those silver reserves were depleted in 1904, the Mint ceased to strike the Morgan dollar. The Pittman Act, passed in 1918, authorized the melting and recoining of millions of silver dollars. Pursuant to the act, Morgan dollars resumed mintage for one year in 1921. The design was replaced by the Peace dollar later the same year.\n\nIn the early 1960s, a large quantity of uncirculated Morgan dollars in their original bags were discovered in the Treasury vaults, including issues once thought rare. Individuals began purchasing large quantities of the pieces at face value and then removed them from circulation through hoarding, and eventually the Treasury ceased exchanging silver certificates for silver coin. Beginning in the 1970s, the Treasury conducted a sale of silver dollars minted at the Carson City Mint through the General Services Administration. In 2006, Morgan's reverse design was used on a silver dollar issued to commemorate the old San Francisco Mint building.\n\nIn 1873, Congress enacted the Fourth Coinage Act, which effectively ended the bimetallic standard in the United States by demonetizing silver bullion. Prior to enactment of the Coinage Act, silver could be brought to the mints and coined into legal tender for a small fee. With such a system in place, bullion producers could have silver coined into dollars when the intrinsic value of a silver dollar was lower than the face value, thus making a profit, flooding the money supply and causing inflation. The act ended production of the standard silver dollar (then the Seated Liberty dollar, as designed by Christian Gobrecht) and provided for mintage of a silver trade dollar, which was intended to compete with Mexican dollars for use in the Orient. Under the act, bullion producers were allowed to bring bullion to the mints in order to be cast into bars or coined into the newly authorized trade dollars for a small fee. Trade dollars initially held legal tender status, but it was revoked in 1876 to prevent bullion producers from making a profit by coining silver into trade dollars when the value of the metal was low. The restrictions on free coinage laid out in the Coinage Act initially met little resistance from mining interests until the price of silver declined rapidly due to increased mining in the Western United States. Protests also came from bankers, manufacturers and farmers, who felt an increased money supply would have a positive impact. Groups were formed that demanded the free coinage of silver (or \"free silver\") in order to inflate the dollar following the Panic of 1873.\n\nBeginning in 1876, several bills were introduced in the House of Representatives in an effort to resume the free coinage of silver. One such bill introduced into the House by Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri was passed in the fall of 1876. Republican senator William B. Allison of Iowa added important amendments to the bill in the Senate. The House bill allowed Free Silver; one of Allison's amendments struck that provision. This same amendment allowed for the issuance of silver certificates for the first time in United States history. The bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The president's veto was overridden on February 28, 1878. What came to be known as the Bland–Allison Act required that the Treasury purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver per month, to be coined into silver dollars at the former gold/silver value ratio of 16:1, meaning that one ounce of gold would be valued the same as sixteen ounces of silver.\n\nIn 1876, Director of the Mint Henry Linderman began efforts to redesign the nation's silver coins. Linderman contacted C.W. Fremantle, Deputy Master of the Royal Mint in London, requesting him to \"find a first class die-sinker who would be willing to take the position of Assistant Engraver at the Mint at Philadelphia.\" In response to Linderman's request, Fremantle wrote \"My inquiries as to an Assistant Engraver lead me very strongly to recommend for the post Mr. George Morgan, age 30, who has made himself a considerable name, but for whom there is not much opening at present in this country.\" An agreement was reached between Linderman and Morgan for the engraver to work at the Philadelphia Mint under Chief Engraver William Barber on a six-month trial basis.\n\nMorgan arrived in Philadelphia on October 9, 1876. His earliest pattern coins designed during his tenure at the Philadelphia Mint were intended for the half dollar. In 1876, Morgan enrolled as a student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts to prepare to create a new Liberty head design. Morgan also obtained studies from nature of the bald eagle for preparation of the reverse design. For the representation of Liberty, Morgan sought to depict an American woman rather than the usual Greek–style figures. Morgan's friend, artist Thomas Eakins, suggested he use Anna Willess Williams of Philadelphia as a model. In total, Morgan had five sittings with Williams; he declared her profile to be the most perfect he had seen.\n\nOn October 18, 1877, Linderman requested Superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint James Pollock to \"instruct Mr. Morgan to prepare without delay, dies for a silver dollar, the designs, inscriptions, and arrangement thereof to be the same as the enclosed impression for the Half Dollar and numbered '2' substituting the words 'one dollar' in place of 'half dollar'\". Linderman also ordered Pollock to \"instruct Mr. Barber to prepare a reverse die for a dollar with a representation of an eagle as well as the inscriptions required by law. He will select whichever of his Heads of Liberty he prefers for the obverse of the same.\" Linderman evidently preferred the designs of Morgan over those of the Chief Engraver; he wrote Pollock on February 21, 1878, \"I have now to state for your information, that it is my intention, in the event of the silver bill now pending in Congress, becoming law, to request the approval by the Secretary of the Treasury, of the dies prepared by Mr. Morgan.\"\n\nProduction of the coins did not commence until March 11, more than a week after the passage of the Bland–Allison Act. The first acceptable strike, after adjustments to the press, was coined at 3:17 p.m. at the Philadelphia Mint. This piece was given to President Hayes; the second and third were given to Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman and Mint Director Henry Linderman.\n\nLinderman desired to involve the western mints of San Francisco and Carson City in production in order to help reach the monthly quota necessary under the Bland–Allison Act. Pressure was so great at the Philadelphia Mint that it halted production of all other coins and began operating overtime. Use of the western mints was delayed, however, as all dies were prepared at the Philadelphia Mint, and it was believed that the Western mints did not have the proper equipment to prepare the dies for use. During the second week of production, Linderman pointed out what he called a \"slight imperfection\" in the dies for the dollar. The reason for the changes was to reduce the relief of the designs and to change the number of tail feathers on the eagle from eight to seven; this was done because all prior United States coinage depicted the bald eagle as having an odd number of tail feathers. The high relief had caused the dies to have a shorter life. Dies were eventually sent to the Western mints, arriving in both San Francisco and Carson City on April 16, 1878. The New Orleans Mint began striking the new silver dollars in 1879.\n\nThe Denver Mint, established in 1906, struck the coins for only one year, in 1921. The mint marks appearing on the coins are none, representing Philadelphia, \"\" for Carson City, \"\" for San Francisco, \"\" for New Orleans and \"\" for Denver. In order to conform to the Coinage Act of 1837, the Morgan dollar contained ninety percent silver and ten percent copper, measured in diameter and weighed .\n\nMintage of the Morgan dollar remained relatively steady until the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act on July 14, 1890. The act, authored by Ohio senator and former Treasury secretary John Sherman, forced the Treasury to increase the amount of silver purchased to each month. Supporters of the act believed that an increase in the amount of silver purchased would result in inflation, helping to relieve the nation's farmers. The act also received support from mining interests because such large purchases would cause the price of silver to rise and increase their profits. Despite the Act's requiring large purchases of silver indefinitely, it provided that the Mint must coin 2,000,000 silver dollars each month only until 1891. Since the Treasury already had a surplus of silver dollars, minting of dollars dropped sharply beginning in 1892. The silver that remained after mintage of the dollars was used to mint dimes, quarters and half dollars.\n\nBeginning early in 1893, a number of industrial firms, including the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and the National Cordage Company went bankrupt. The resulting bank runs and failures became known as the Panic of 1893. In June of that year, President Grover Cleveland, who believed that the Panic was caused by the inflation generated by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, called a special session of Congress in order to repeal it. The act was repealed on November 1, 1893. On June 13, 1898, Congress ordered the coining of all the remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act into silver dollars. Silver dollar production rose again, until the bullion was exhausted in 1904, when it ceased.\n\nThe German government began a propaganda campaign during World War I to discredit the United Kingdom's currency in India. The Germans convinced Indian citizens that British banknotes in that country could not be redeemed for silver. This led to a run on the British supply of silver. In response, United States Democratic senator Key Pittman of Nevada introduced legislation in 1918 that was intended to offer financial relief to the British government. The bill, passed on April 22, 1918, stated that \"sales of silver bullion under authority of this act may be made for the purpose of conserving the existing stock of gold in the United States, of providing silver for subsidiary coinage and for commercial use, and of assisting foreign governments at war with the enemies of the United States\". The Pittman Act authorized the U.S. to melt up to 350,000,000 silver dollars, and this commenced immediately after the Act's passage. The U.S. eventually melted a total of 270,232,722 silver dollars. Of that amount, 259,121,554  were sold to the United Kingdom at the cost of one dollar per troy ounce.\n\nThe U.S. only minted the Morgan dollar again during 1921, the only year in which Morgan dollars were struck at the Denver mint. Since the Treasury had destroyed the obsolete Morgan dollar dies in 1910, Morgan had to create an entirely new master die. Another provision of the Pittman Act authorized the U.S. to mint a replacement coin for every silver dollar melted. During the same year, the Peace dollar was first issued to commemorate the end of World War I. The Peace dollar was supposedly minted to replace the Morgan dollar under the terms of the Pittman Act but without congressional authorization, despite the fact that the Act did not describe the coin design. The change in design was actually authorized under an 1890 act of Congress, which stated:\nUntil 1964, U.S. citizens could redeem paper money known as silver certificates for silver dollars at a U.S. Treasury mint on demand. In 1962, an individual redeemed a silver certificate and received a rare and valuable Morgan dollar in exchange. The coin was from a bag of silver dollars in the vault of the Philadelphia Mint. This incident triggered huge interest, and between November 1962 and March 1964, millions of Morgan and Peace dollars were sold to the general public. The demand to exchange silver certificates for silver dollars was so great that lines formed outside of the Treasury Building in Washington, D.C. Some people in line were pushing wheelbarrows. The U.S. Treasury discovered previously unknown mint bags of Carson City dollars in its vaults containing slightly more than 2.8 million Carson City silver dollars in the Treasury vaults. Treasury officials decided to hold them back because the total number of coins minted at the Carson City mint were generally lower than others.\n\nOn May 12, 1969, the Joint Commission on Coinage held a meeting in order to determine the best way to sell the Carson City-minted dollars earlier held back by Treasury officials. They recommended a mail bid sale. Legislation was passed on December 31, 1970 directing the Treasury to transfer the silver dollars to the Administrator of General Services who was given the responsibility for marketing and selling the coins. The legislation also stated that all proceeds from the sale were to be \"covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.\" Congress supplied the General Services Administration with $10 million to market the dollar coins. Advertising consisted of posters and brochures distributed to post offices, banks and various financial institutions, as well as television documentaries. The coins were sorted and mounted in small plastic display cases. The GSA conducted a total of seven mail bid sales between 1972 and 1980. In total, the sales generated $107 million in revenue.\n\nOn June 15, 2006, legislation was approved that provided for the minting of a silver dollar and a five dollar gold coin in \"commemoration of the Old Mint at San Francisco,\" with surcharges to be given to the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society in an effort to rehabilitate the Old Mint. In total, 100,000 gold and 500,000 silver commemorative coins were authorized. Authorization came at the behest of several hobby publications, who enlisted readers to contact their local congressmen and persuade them to pass necessary legislation. The designs approved for the silver dollar bear a left-frontal view of the Old Mint building and a copy of Morgan's eagle design on the obverse and reverse, respectively.

The name is probably from Bulgarian \"shuma\" '(deciduous forest).' Some believe Konstantin Jireček that it comes from the name of the Bulgarian emperor Simeon the Great. In the following periods, the city was mentioned with variants, such as \"Şumena\", \"Şumna\", \"Şumular\", \"Sumunum\", \"Şumnu\" and \"Şumen\". The eleventh edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica lists it as \"Shumla\", similar to the way it lists Pleven as Plevna.\n\nEarliest reports for Shumen fortress date back to the early Iron Age. From the 12th century BC is the first fort, surrounding accessible parts of the area. Archaeological surveys, conducted in 1957, 1961 to 1987, determined the chronological periods, the lifestyle and the livelihood of the inhabitants of the fortress. It had a wall thickness of about two meters, built of rough stones. In the 5th century BC a second wall was built in front of the former.\n\nIn the 2nd century the Romans built a military fortress on the ruins of the Thracian fortifications. The construction of the wall is already bonded to mortar; a tower was constructed above the gate; square tower was built to the west and semicircular to the south. In the 4-5th centuries the entire hill was fortified with a new wall with nine towers. Between the 8th and the 10th century the fort was renovated, for the purpose the Roman wall and towers were used and to the northeast was built a new wall with two towers.\n\nIn 681 khan Asparukh incorporated the territory into the First Bulgarian Empire. In 811 Shumen was burned by the Byzantine emperor Nicephorus. He was killed at the Battle of Pliska. Khan Krum of Bulgaria encased Nicephorus's skull in silver and used it as a cup for wine drinking. The Bulgarian fortification of the 7-10th centuries developed into a feudal city with a castle with surrounding inner and outer defensive zones, in which can be counted 28 towers and bastions, three gates and five small porticoes, and many churches and workshops (12th to 14th century). During the golden age of Bulgarian culture under Simeon the Great (893-927), Shumen was a centre of cultural and religious activity, and may have borne the name \"Simeonis\".\n\nDuring the Second Bulgarian Empire, Shumen was a significant military, administrative and economic center, displacing the old Bulgarian capital Preslav and developing outside the fortress. In the medieval city of Shumen the main religion was the Orthodox Christianity, evidence of which were the found in the outline of the walls, seven churches, commemorative coins with the image of crosses, angels, and numerous findings of Orthodox crosses separately, as well as their image on rings and on other artefacts, found in the graves and the homes. Change occurs only after the Ottoman conquest of the city in the 15th century, when Islam was introduced.\n\nIn 1388 the sultan Murad I forced it to surrender to the Ottoman Empire. After Władysław Warneńczyk's unsuccessful crusade in 1444, the city was destroyed by the Ottomans and moved to its present location. In the 18th century it was enlarged and fortified. Three times (1774, 1810 and 1828) it was unsuccessfully attacked by Russian armies. The Turks consequently gave it the name of \"Gazi\" (\"Victorious\"). In 1854 it was the headquarters of Omar Pasha and the point at which the Turkish army concentrated (see Crimean War). Many Turks were settled in the area during the Ottoman period to spread the Islamic faith among the Slavic Bulgarian Christians and many Muslim Turkic men married Bulgarian women and converted them to Islam during the period .\n\nDuring the 19th century, Shumen was an important centre of the Bulgarian National Revival, with the first celebration of Cyril and Methodius in the Bulgarian lands taking place on 11 May 1813 and the first theatre performance. A girls' religious school was established in 1828; a class school for girls and a \"chitalishte\" (community centre) followed in 1856. The first Bulgarian symphony orchestra was founded in the city in 1850. In the same year, influential Hungarian politician and revolutionary leader Lajos Kossuth spent a part of his exile in the then-Ottoman town of Shumen. The house he lived in is preserved as a museum.\n\nOn 22 June 1878 Shumen finally capitulated to the Russians and became part of the newly independent Bulgaria. In 1882 the Shumen Brewery, the first brewery in Bulgaria, was founded.\n\nIn the period 1950–1965 the city was called \"Kolarovgrad\", after the name of the communist leader Vasil Kolarov.\n\nThe city lies west of Varna and is built within a cluster of hills, northern outliers of the eastern Balkans, which curve around it on the west and south in the shape of a horseshoe. A rugged ravine intersects the ground longitudinally in the horseshoe ridge.\n\nFrom Shumen roads radiate northwards to the Danubian cities of Rousse and Silistra and to Dobruja, southwards to the passes of the Balkans, and eastwards to Varna and Balchik.\n\nIn January 2012, Shumen was inhabited by 80 511 people in the city limits, while the Shumen Municipality with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 93 160 inhabitants. The following table presents the change of the population after 1887. The number of the residents of the city (not the municipality) reached its peak in the period 1990-1991 when it exceeded 110,000.\n\nAccording to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nTotal: 80,855\n\nThe population of the city is majorly Eastern Orthodox, with a significant portion of Muslims and much smaller minorities of other religions.\n\nIn the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, Shumen is a part of the Eparchy (diocese) of Varna and Veliki Preslav and the capital of the Shumen church district (okolia). There are two major Orthodox temples in the city, the Church of the Holy Ascension (est. 1829) and the Church of the Three Holy Hierarchs (est. 1857), and a few chapels.\n\nIn Shumen is located the largest mosque in Bulgaria and the second largest on the Balkans, the Sherif Halil Pasha Mosque, more commonly known as the Tombul (or Tumbul) Mosque, built between 1740 and 1744.\n\nShumen has 11 elementary and five common schools, as well as two high schools. The University of Shumen Episkop Konstantin Preslavski, the Artillery and Air Defense Faculty to the Vasil Levski National Military University and the Affiliate of Medical University of Varna are the higher education establishments in the city. The former operates a small astronomical observatory.\n\nFC Shumen 1929 was the local football club since 2013 and the financial failure of PFC Shumen 2010. The club used the Panayot Volov Stadium as its home ground. Basketball, volleyball and handball are also represented, and most of the games are held at the 'Mladost' sports centre and Arena Shumen, the 2,300-seater indoor hall opened in 2018.\n\nOther sporting activities include martial arts (mostly karate) and horse racing. Shumen has its own rallying tournament, the 'Stari Stolitsi'.\n\nShumen boasts the Monument to 1300 Years of Bulgaria, regarded as the only monument in the world to depict the history of a whole country from its creation to the present day.\n\nThe Shumen Fortress, partially restored after being destroyed by the Ottomans, is an important historical monument of the medieval Bulgarian Empire. It is not far from the city on the Shumen Plateau.\n\nThe Regional Historical Museum, which is a successor of the Archaeological Society created in Shumen in 1904 by Rafail Popov.\n\nThe Madara Horseman, a World Heritage Site and the only such example of medieval rock art in Europe, is an ancient (710 AD) monument usually attributed to the Bulgar culture. It lies some from Shumen.\nThe religious buildings in the city include the Eastern Orthodox Holy Three Saints Cathedral and Holy Ascension Basilica, as well as the Sherif Halil Pasha mosque (also known as the Tombul Mosque), the largest mosque in Bulgaria and one of the largest in the Balkans, serving Shumen and the region's Muslim minority.\n\nKurşun çeşme is a fountain built in 1774 built in the times of Ottoman Empire. \n\n\nShumen is twinned with:\nShumen Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Shumen. The tails of the Bulgarian currency lev are the same as the seal of Shumen, showing the Madara Rider, away from the city.\n\n"}

It is or was used to prosecute people engaging in oral and anal sex, homosexual activity, and third gender people, such as \"hijra\" in India and \"apwint\" in Myanmar. It remains in force in many former colonies, while others have repealed it.\n\nAlthough Section 377 did not explicitly include the word \"homosexual\", it has been used extensively to prosecute homosexual activity. The provision was introduced by British colonial authorities in the British Raj in 1860 as Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and functioned as the legal impetus behind the criminalization of what was referred to as, \"unnatural offenses\" throughout the British colonies, in several cases with the same section number. \n\nAlthough many former British colonies have gained independence through statehood since Section 377 was implemented, it remains in the penal codes of Malaysia, Singapore (see Section 377A of the Penal Code of Singapore), Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Jamaica. It served as the model for similar laws that remain in force in Bhutan, Brunei, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Tuvalu, Samoa, Malawi, Mauritius, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka (as Article 365 of the Sri Lankan Penal Code), Ghana, The Gambia, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. It was also the model for since-repealed laws in Australia, Botswana, Fiji, Hong Kong, India, and New Zealand. \n\n377. Unnatural offences: Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation: Penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the offence described in this section.\n\nIn 2018, after decades of grassroots activism, the application of section 377 of the Indian Penal Code to private consensual sex between men was ruled unconstitutional by India's Supreme Court, effectively decriminalizing private homosexual activity. As scholars have discussed, \"ironically, while Western notions of identity and rights are the engine driving movements to repeal discriminatory laws and practices, in many cases Western colonizers and missionaries either instituted the laws or brought with them the idea that sodomy or 'unnatural sexual practices' were to be equated with Satanism and sin.\"\n\n"}

It features an OpenGL-accelerated canvas, colour management support, an advanced brush engine, non-destructive layers and masks (similar to Adobe Photoshop), group-based layer management, vector artwork support and switchable customisation profiles. It is written in C++ using Qt and runs on Windows and Unix-like OS (including Linux and macOS).\n\nThe project's current name \"Krita\" has multi-cultural references. In Swedish, \"krita\" means \"crayon\" and \"rita\" means \"to draw\". In the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata, the name \"krita\" is used in a context where it can be translated into \"perfect\".\n\nEarly development of the project can be tracked back to 1998 when Matthias Ettrich, founder of KDE, showcased a Qt GUI hack for GIMP at Linux Kongress. The idea of building a Qt-based image editor was later passed to KImage, maintained by Michael Koch, as a part of KOffice suite. In 1999, Matthias Elter proposed the idea of building the software using Corba around ImageMagick. To avoid existing trademarks on the market, the project underwent numerous name changes: KImageShop, Krayon, until it was finally settled with \"Krita\" in 2002. The first public version of Krita was released with KOffice 1.4 in 2004. In years between 2004 and 2009, Krita was developed as a generic image manipulation software like Photoshop and GIMP.\n\nChange of direction happened to the project in 2009, with a new goal of becoming a digital painting software like Corel Painter and SAI. Also from that point, the project began to experiment with various ways of funding its development, including Google Summer of Code and funded jobs for students. As a result, the development gained speed and resulted in better performance and stability.\n\nThe Krita Foundation was created in 2013 to provide support for Krita's development. It collaborated with Intel to create Krita Sketch as a marketing campaign and Krita Studio with KO GmbH as commercially supported version for movie and VFX studios. Kickstarter campaigns have been used to crowdfund Krita's development since 2014.\n\nThe current version of Krita is developed with Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5. It is designed primarily for concept artists, illustrators, matte and texture artists, and the VFX industry. It has the following key features\n\nThe most prominent feature of Krita is arguably its UX design with graphics tablet users in mind. It uses a combination of pen buttons, keyboard modifiers and an icon-based HUD to ensure frequently-used functions can be accessed by fewer clicks, without the need to search through text-based menus.\n\nMost-used drawing commands can be blindly accessed by combining keyboard modifiers with pen/mouse buttons and gestures:\nPop-up Palette is Krita's right click HUD. It enables instant access to the following functions:\n\nKrita's core digital painting tools include:\n\nKrita's animation tools are designed for frame-by-frame raster animation. They have the following features:\n\nKrita uses vector tools for non-destructive editing of the following objects:\n\nKrita's layer and mask features include:\nKrita's resource manager allows each brush or texture preset to be tagged by a user and quickly searched, filtered and loaded as a group. A collection of user-made presets can be packaged as \"bundles\" and loaded as a whole. Krita provides many such brush set and texture bundles on its official website.\n\nCustomisable tool panels are known as Dockers in Krita. Actions include:\nWorkspaces allow UI customizations for different workflows to be saved and loaded on demand.\n\nOpenGL accelerated canvas is used to speed up Krita's performance. It provides the following benefits:\n\nFull colour management is supported in Krita with the following capabilities:\n\nKrita has a collection of built-in filters and supports G'MIC filters. It has realtime filter preview support.\n\nFilters included in a default installation: levels, colour adjustment curves, brightness/contrast curve, desaturate, invert, auto contrast, HSV adjustment, pixelise, raindrops, oil paint, gaussian blur, motion blur, blur, lens blur, colour to alpha, color transfer, minimise channel, maximise channel, top/left/bottom/right edge detection, sobel, sharpen, mean removal, unsharp mask, gaussian noise removal, wavelet noise reducer, emboss horizontal only/in all directions/(laplacian)/vertical only/with variable depth/horizontal and vertical, small tiles, round corners, phong bumpmap.\n\nKrita's native document format is Krita Document (.kra). It can also save to many other file formats including PSD.\nKrita's mascot is Kiki the Cyber Squirrel, a robotic, anthropomorphic squirrel character created by Tyson Tan. The community collectively decided the mascot to be a squirrel. The first version of Kiki was posted to the KDE forum in 2012 and was used in Krita version 2.6's introduction booklet. Kiki has been used as Krita's startup splash screen since Krita version 2.8. So far, each new version of Krita has come with a new version of Kiki. Kiki has been used for Krita's merchandise shop items and Krita's Steam project artworks.\n\nKrita sprints are events during which Krita developers and artists get together for a few days, exchange ideas and do programming face-to-face, in order to speedup development and improve relationships between members.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2068592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068592", "title": "Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov", "text": "Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov\n\nNikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov (; surname also Anglicized as \"Fedorov\", June 9, 1829 – December 28, 1903) was a Russian Orthodox Christian philosopher, who was part of the Russian cosmism movement and a precursor of transhumanism. Fyodorov advocated radical life extension, physical immortality and even resurrection of the dead, using scientific methods.\n\nFyodorov's parents were the Rurikid knyaz (noble) Pavel Ivanovich Gagarin and Elisaveta Ivanova, a woman of lower-class nobility.\n\nHe studied at the Richelieu Lyceum in Odessa. From 1854 to 1868, he served as a teacher in various small Russian towns. In 1878, he joined the Rumyantsev Museum staff as a librarian. Fyodorov opposed the idea of property of books and ideas and never published anything during his lifetime. His selected articles were printed posthumously with the title \"Philosophy of the Common Task\" (also known as \"Philosophy of Physical Resurrection\").\n\nFyodorov was a futurist, who theorized about the eventual perfection of the human race and society (i.e., utopia), including radical ideas like immortality, revival of the dead, space and ocean colonization.\nHis writings greatly influenced mystic Peter Uspensky. He also had direct contact with early rocket theorist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who visited the library where he worked over a 3-year period. He was also known to Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky.\n\nLeo Tolstoy was of the highest opinion of Fyodorov. They were quite friendly, and shared many ideas in the 1880s and early 90s. But Fyodorov refused to see Tolstoy again after 1892, because of their ideological differences. That was the time of some food shortages in Russia because of poor harvest. Tolstoy published in the London \"Daily Telegraph\" an article accusing the Russian government of not doing enough for the peasants, which displeased many Russian conservatives.\n\nWhile Fyodorov shared with Tolstoy many religious ideas, he was also a church-going Christian who cared very much for the Orthodox ritual observance. This was also a big stumbling block between them.\n\nFyodorov argued that evolutionary process was directed towards increased intelligence and its role in the development of life. Humanity is the culmination of evolution, as well as its creator and director. Humans must therefore direct evolution where their reason and morality dictate. Fyodorov also argued that mortality is the most obvious indicator of the still imperfect, contradictory nature of humanity and the underlying reason for most evil and nihilism of humankind. Fyodorov stated that the struggle against death can become the most natural cause uniting all people of Earth, regardless of their nationality, race, citizenship or wealth (he called this the Common Cause).\n\nFyodorov thought that death and afterdeath existence should become the subject of comprehensive scientific inquiry, that achieving immortality and revival is the greatest goal of science, and that this knowledge must leave the laboratories and become the common property of all: \"Everyone must be learning and everything be the subject of knowledge and action\".\n\nHuman life, emphasized Fyodorov, dies for two reasons. First is internal: due to the material organization of a human, his or her functionality is incapable of infinite self-renewal. To overcome this, psychophysiological regulation of human organisms is needed. The second reason is the unpredictable nature of the external environment; its destructive character must be overcome with the regulation of Nature. Regulation of nature, \"introducing will and reason into nature\" includes, according to Fyodorov, prevention of natural disasters, control of Earth's climate, fight against viruses and epidemics, mastery of solar power, space exploration and unlimited creative work there.\n\nAchieving immortality and resurrection of all people who ever lived are two inseparable goals, according to Fyodorov. Immortality is impossible, both ethically and physically, without resurrection. We cannot allow our ancestors, who gave us life and culture, to remain buried, or our relatives and friends to die. Achieving immortality for individuals alive today and future generations is only a partial victory over death – only the first stage. The complete victory will be achieved only when everyone is resurrected and transformed to enjoy immortal life.\n\nFyodorov tried to plan specific actions for scientific research of the possibility of restoring life and making it infinite.\nHis first project involved collecting and synthesizing decayed remains of dead based on \"knowledge and control over all atoms and molecules of the world\". This idea of Fyodorov is related to the modern practice of cloning.\nThe second method described by Fyodorov is genetic-hereditary.\nThe revival could be done successively in the ancestral line: sons and daughters restore their fathers and mothers, they in turn restore their parents and so on. This means restoring the ancestors using the hereditary information that they passed on to their children. Using this genetic method it is only possible to create a genetic twin of the dead person (the problem of identity in cloning). It is necessary to give back the revived person his old mind, his personality. Fyodorov speculates about the idea of \"radial images\" that may contain the personalities of the people and survive after death. Nevertheless, Fyodorov noted that even if a soul is destroyed after death, humanity will learn to restore it whole by mastering the forces of decay and fragmentation.\n\nThe revival of people who lived during the past is not a recreation of their past physical form – it was imperfect, parasitic, centered on mortal existence. Fyodorov's idea was to transform it into self-creating, mind-controlled form, capable of infinite renewal, which is immortal. Those who haven’t died will go through the same transformation. Humans will have to become creators and organizers of their organisms (\"our body will be our business\"). In the past the development of civilization happened by increasing human power using external tools and machines – the human body remained imperfect.\n\nFyodorov stated that people needed to reconcile the difference between the power of technology and weakness of the human physical form. The transition is overdue from purely technical development, a \"prosthetic\" civilization, to organic progress, when not just external tools, artificial implements, but the organisms themselves are improved, so that, for example, a person can fly, see far and deep, travel through space, live in any environment. People must become capable of \"organodevelopment\" that so far only nature was capable of. Fyodorov discussed supremacy of mind, \"giving, developing organs for itself\" and anticipated V. Vernadsky’s idea of autotrophic humans. He argues that a person must become an autotrophic, self-feeding creature, acquire a new mode of energy exchange with the environment that will not end.\n\nFyodorov repeatedly said that only general scientific studies of aging, death and postmortem studies can deliver the means to overcome death and promote indefinite healthy lifespan.\n\nThe 2011 BBC documentary \"Knocking on Heaven's Door\", about the Space Race in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, suggests that, in many people's eyes, Nikolai Fyodorov was the true father of the Soviet space project that put the first man in space.\n\nFyodorov's thought is extensively though indirectly discussed and alluded to in the well-regarded 2010 science fiction novel \"The Quantum Thief\"; it is implied that the founders of the post-human collective of uploaded minds called the Sobornost were inspired by Fyodorov and other thinkers associated with cosmism.\n\nThe 2013 novel \"Strange Bodies\" by Marcel Theroux imagines Fyodorov's ideas of the Common Task being developed by Soviet and post-Soviet research to implant a mind into another body using an encoded lexicon from the original mind and an unspecified, but painful, procedure.\n\n\n"}

Gait, along with his twin brother Gary Gait, had outstanding playing careers at Syracuse University, in the National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse, the Western Lacrosse Association, and at the international level for Canada.\n\nPaul and his twin brother Gary played NCAA lacrosse at Syracuse University as midfielders, where they set numerous records from 1987 to 1990 and popularized innovative moves such as behind-the-back passing and scoring. One of the best NCAA players of all time, Paul helped lead Syracuse to three national championships and was selected as a First Team All-Americans by the USILA three times, in 1988, 1989, and 1990. Paul was also named the Most Outstanding Player of the 1989 NCAA Division I Lacrosse Championship Tournament.\n\nAfter defeating Loyola in the 1990 NCAA Division I lacrosse tournament finals, the NCAA determined that head coach Roy Simmons Jr's wife Nancy Simmons had improperly co-signed for a car loan for Paul Gait. Gait was ruled ineligible for postseason play, and Syracuse vacated their tournament records and title.\n\nAfter college, he played with his brother for the storied amateur Mount Washington Lacrosse Club in the 1990s.\n\nPaul and Gary have both starred at all levels of professional lacrosse, including the National Lacrosse League, the Western Lacrosse Association, Major League Lacrosse, and at the international level for the Canadian National Team. Paul was a 3-time winner of the Mann Cup MVP award. The twins were named Co-MVPs of the Mann Cup in 1999, when they played for the Victoria Shamrocks. Paul initially retired from play following the 2002 NLL season but then returned during the 2005 NLL season to play for the Colorado Mammoth with his brother. He played four games totaling nine points and then retired again after the 2005 season. Paul is sixth all time on the NLL points total list with 712 points in 13 seasons. In 2001 Paul was named the MLL playoff and championship game MVP, after leading the Long Island Lizards to their first MLL title, with a record setting 7 goal performance,(on 8 shots)in the MLL championship game. In 2002 Paul lead the NLL in goals and points and was name the league MVP. He retired due to the early onset osteoarthritis in his back, ankles and elbows.\n\nIn 2005, both Gait brothers were inducted into the United States Lacrosse National Hall of Fame. The following year, in 2006, both brothers were among the five charter members to be voted into the National Lacrosse League Hall of Fame. Paul, Gary and Jim Brown were also named to the NCAA all century team.\n\nIn 1990, Paul represented STX Lacrosse as a Sales Representative. In 1994 Paul started GBLax, a lacrosse specialty retail business located in Syracuse NY. In 1996 Paul sold GBLAX and became an independent lacrosse equipment design/developer for J.deBeer & Son, where he developed a line of lacrosse equipment for the softball manufacturing company. He was hired full-time by deBeer in 1996 where he worked, in various roles until 2011, ultimately becoming the company president between 2003-2011. In his tenure at deBeer he was credited for developing the modern women's lacrosse head (Apex) and has revolutionized the women's lacrosse pocket. He also introduced the Gait Brand of men's lacrosse equipment in 2003. deBeer/Gait quickly became the world's leading producer of women's lacrosse equipment and Canadian box lacrosse gear.

{"id": "2068611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068611", "title": "Richborough", "text": "Richborough\n\nRichborough () is a settlement north of Sandwich on the east coast of the county of Kent, England. Richborough lies close to the Isle of Thanet. The population of the settlement is included in the civil parish of Ash.\n\nAlthough now some distance from the sea, Richborough stood at the southern end of the Wantsum Channel from prehistory to the early medieval period. The channel provided a safe searoute from the continent to the Thames estuary and separated the Isle of Thanet from the mainland.\n\nThe channel has now silted up, but prior to this, Richborough was an important natural harbour and was the landing place of the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43. Until October 2008 there was uncertainty whether this was the site of the Claudian invasion of Britain; two ditches at the site which have been dated to the Roman period were interpreted as defensive structures; however, some archaeologists had favoured the theory that the landing took place in the vicinity of modern-day Chichester. The 2008 discovery proved that this was a defensive site of a Roman beachhead, protecting 700 metres of coast.\n\nThe suffragan bishop of Richborough, in the Diocese of Canterbury, was created in 1995 to provide a second provincial episcopal visitor (after Ebbsfleet) for the Province of Canterbury.\n\nThe Romans founded the site and, after their withdrawal, the site was occupied by a Saxon religious settlement (since St Augustine landed in 597 at nearby Ebbsfleet).\n\nThe site is managed by English Heritage who run historical events on the site throughout the summer.\n\nDuring the First World War the capacity of Dover and other nearby ports was found to be inadequate, and a major harbour was constructed at Richborough. Its purpose was to provide the British Expeditionary Force with its heavy equipment (tanks, guns, railway locomotives, ammunition, horses and fuel).\n\nIn 1917, the British Government began to look into the possibility of installing a cross-Channel train ferry at Richborough to allow Roll-on/roll-off transportation of railway rolling stock, artillery and supplies to the allied Front Lines. This was the first time that sea-going Roll-on/roll-off ferries had been used from Britain. Three new train-ferries were built , and and operations began on 10 February 1918, conveying nearly 900 tons of cargo at a time between Richborough and Calais and Dunkirk. Although existing barge services were still in operation across the Channel from Richborough, the use of train-ferries was more practical for larger and heavier cargos, such as tanks.\n\nThe use of train-ferries greatly reduced the amount of labour required in the transport of these items. It took only 30 to 40 minutes to load or unload the 54 railway wagons and fifty or sixty motor vehicles that could be carried by these train-ferries. An analysis done at the time found that to transport 1,000 tons of war material from the point of manufacture to the front by conventional means involved the use of 1,500 labourers, whereas when using train-ferries that number decreased to around 100 labourers.\n\nTo accommodate the train-ferries, a new type of terminal had to be designed and built at Richbrough, Calais and Dunkirk. Adjustable steel bridges with two sets of railway lines, spanning between 80 and 100 feet depending on the local conditions at the each port, were installed at each of the three ports to allow a true connection between railway lines on shore and the tracks on the ferry.\nBy mid-1918 it had become a very large site, occupying 2000 acres and capable of handling 20,000 tons of traffic each week.\n\nAfter the signing of the Armistice on 11 November 1918, train ferries were used extensively for the return of material from the Front. Indeed, according to war office statistics, a greater tonnage of material was transported by train ferry from Richborough in 1919 than in 1918. As the train ferries had space for motor transport as well as railway rolling stock, thousands of lorries, motor cars and \"B Type\" buses used these ferries to return to England.\n\nThe Richborough Power Station was opened, within the port, in 1962 burning coal as its fuel. Then in 1971 it was converted to run on oil before it was finally converted again to burn the controversial fuel Orimulsion during the final years of operation. Orimulsion is an emulsion originating from the Orinoco Basin, which was offloaded here. The plant closed down in 1996, but much of it remained in situ until the demolition of the three cooling towers on 11 March 2012. A new Energy Park is planned for the site, including a Diesel Peak Generator.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2068613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068613", "title": "Ernest K. Gann", "text": "Ernest K. Gann\n\nErnest Kellogg Gann (October 13, 1910 – December 19, 1991) was an American aviator, author, sailor, and conservationist. He is known for his novels \"Island in the Sky\" and \"The High and the Mighty\" and his classic memoir of early commercial aviation \"Fate Is the Hunter\", all of which were made into major motion pictures.\n\nGann was born in Lincoln, Nebraska to a prosperous Midwestern family; his father was an executive with General Telephone and Telegraph in Lincoln, Nebraska; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Chicago, Illinois. Rebelling against his father's strong desire that he seek a career with the telephone business, Ernest pursued several other interests as he matured. He was fascinated by topics including photography, movie-making, and aviation. As a young man, he showed little interest in school and performed poorly. His parents decided that he needed discipline and that he should attend a military school. He was sent to the Culver Military Academy (now Culver Academies) for his high school years. Despite many misadventures and struggles with the harsh academic environment and strict rules at Culver, he graduated at age 19 in 1930. He elected to pursue filmmaking, and matriculated with the Yale School of Drama. After his studies at Yale, Gann worked in New York City at Radio City Music Hall as a projectionist and later as a commercial movie cartoonist.\n\nOn September 18, 1933, Gann married Eleanor Helen Michaud in Chicago, Illinois. They had three children: George Kellogg Gann, (November 12, 1935); Polly Wing Gann; and Steven Anthony Gann (March 4, 1941).\n\nA chance encounter gained Gann a job with \"The March of Time\", a documentary movie series associated with \"Time\" magazine. While working on the feature \"Inside Nazi Germany\" in 1936, Gann narrowly escaped Hitler's troops as they marched into the Rhineland. Returning to New York, he relocated his family to a new home in Rockland County where the lure of a local airport, Christie Brothers in New City, New York, rekindled his interest with aviation. He purchased a half partnership in a Stinson Reliant (gullwing) aircraft with actor Burgess Meredith, obtained his pilot license, and soon became an accomplished aviator.\n\nAfter earning his pilot certificate, Gann spent much of his free time aloft, flying for pleasure. The continuing Great Depression soon cost him his job and he was unable to find another job in the movie business. In search of work, he decided to relocate his family to California. He took odd jobs and flight instructed at Burbank and nearby airports and began to write short stories. A friend got him a part-time job as a co-pilot with a local airline and it was there that he flew his first trips as a professional aviator. During the late 1930s many airlines were hiring as many pilots as they could find; after learning of these opportunities, Gann moved his family back to New York where he was hired by American Airlines to fly Douglas DC-2 and Douglas DC-3 aircraft.\n\nFor several years Gann flew routes in the northeast for American. During 1942, many U.S. airlines' pilots and aircraft were absorbed into the Air Transport Command of the United States Army Air Forces to assist with the war effort. Gann and many of his co-workers at American volunteered to join the group. He flew DC-3s, Douglas C-47s (military versions of the DC-3s), Douglas C-54s (military versions of Douglas DC-4s) and Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express transports (the cargo version of the Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber). His wartime flights took him across the North Atlantic to Europe, and thence to Africa, South America, India, and other exotic places. Some of his most harrowing experiences came while flying The Hump airlift across the Himalayas into China. During the years to come Gann's worldwide travels and various adventures would become the inspiration for many of his novels and screenplays.\n\nAt the end of World War II, the Air Transport Command released the civilian pilots and aircraft to their airlines. Gann decided to quit American Airlines in search of new adventures. He was hired as a pilot with a new company called Matson Airlines, a venture of the Matson steamship line. He flew from the US west coast across the Pacific to Honolulu. This experience created ideas that were developed into one of his best-known works, \"The High and the Mighty\". Matson ultimately ceased operations. After a few more short-lived flying jobs, Gann became discouraged with aviation and began writing as a full-time occupation.\n\nDuring his tenure with Matson, Gann moved his family to the San Francisco area, and it was there that he began writing professionally. In his autobiography he describes cycles of \"boom and bust\" as he would earn seemingly vast sums of money for a book or an article, spend wildly, and then suffer for long periods with little or no income. He attempted other types of work, such as fishing, but always resumed writing. Gann began to dislike the difficult and tedious routine of family life, missing the adventures and freedoms of his previous career. His marriage began to suffer and Eleanor eventually decided to divorce Gann. She was afflicted with numerous health problems, including severe rheumatoid arthritis, and following several years of declining health, she died on December 23, 1966 at Pebble Beach, California. Gann would endure several more tragedies in his personal life, including the death of his eldest son in 1973; while working on an oil tanker in the Gulf of Alaska, George was swept overboard in a storm.\nGann had a lifelong love of sailing. He made many friends in the nautical community in and around San Francisco and, when money was scarce for him, tried a few different jobs, mainly in the commercial fishing industry. He owned several boats of various types and sizes during his lifetime. Eventually, after years of planning and preparations, Gann purchased a large metal sailboat in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, which he christened \"Albatross\". Along with his family and a few friends he sailed the boat across the Atlantic Ocean, through the Panama Canal to San Francisco Bay. \"Albatross\" was overhauled and Gann then sailed it around the South Pacific Ocean. He later leased the ship to a movie company to be used as the major prop in a movie based upon his book \"Twilight for the Gods.\" Soon after the production ended, \"Albatross\" was sold and became a school vessel. It was later lost in the Gulf of Mexico. (Its sinking is the topic of a 1996 movie named \"White Squall.\")\n\nAs his family life deteriorated, Gann began spending time with a friend, Dodie Post, whom he later married. Both before and after they were married they were partners in adventure, travel, and later, environmental causes. In 1966 they purchased an ranch on San Juan Island in the state of Washington. This was the beginning of his next great passion, environmental conservation. For that purpose, they later donated the bulk of their ranch to the San Juan Preservation Trust.\n\nGann converted a chicken coop near their ranch house into a writing office. After his death, the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) moved the entire coop and its furnishings, including the barber's chair Gann used at his desk, to the EAA Aviation Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where it is on public display.\n\nDuring the autumn of 1991, Gann again took to the skies to mark the 50th anniversary of his promotion to Captain for American Airlines; it would be his last flight. On December 19, 1991, Gann died in Friday Harbor, San Juan Island, Washington, at the age of 81 after suffering kidney problems for some time.\n\nGann described his writing methods as torturous; he would often literally chain himself to his desk until he finished a certain amount of text. He suffered long periods of writer's block, and frequently worried that he would run out of ideas. Despite his successful career, he continued to have strong feelings of self-doubt and often expressed surprise at the critical praise he received.\n\nGann's major works include the novel \"The High and the Mighty\" and his aviation memoir \"Fate Is the Hunter\" (regarded by many as one of the best-ever books about aviation). Notes and short stories scribbled during long layovers on his journeys across the North Atlantic became the source for his first serious fiction novel, \"Island in the Sky\" (1944), which was inspired by an actual Arctic rescue mission. It became an immediate best-seller as did \"Blaze of Noon\" (1946), a story about early air mail operations. His comprehensive autobiography entitled \"A Hostage to Fortune\" was published in 1978.\n\nAlthough many of his 21 best-selling novels reveal Gann's devotion to aviation, others, including \"Twilight for the Gods\", and \"Fiddler's Green\" display his love of the sea. His experiences as a fisherman, skipper and sailor, all contributed storylines and depth to his nautical fiction. He later wrote an autobiography of his sailing life named \"Song of the Sirens.\"\n\nGann wrote, or adapted from his books, the stories and screenplays for several movies and television shows. For some of these productions he also served as a consultant and technical adviser during filming. Although it received positive reviews, Gann was displeased with the movie version of \"Fate Is the Hunter\", and removed his name from the credits. (He later lamented that this decision cost him a \"fortune\" in royalties, as the movie played repeatedly on television for years afterward.) He wrote the story for the television miniseries \"Masada\", based on \"The Antagonists\", and the story for the 1980 Walt Disney movie, \"The Last Flight of Noah's Ark\".\n\nGann was a member or honorary member of the Society of Flight Test Engineers, Order of Daedalions, Black Birds, OX-5 Aviation Pioneers, Secret Order of Quiet Birdmen, Colgate President's Club, Washington Athletic Club, Grey Eagles Club, 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, Retired Eastern Pilots Association, and American Fighter Pilots Association.\n\nWashington Governor Gary Locke posthumously awarded the Medal of Merit (the state's highest honor) to Gann on July 9, 2003. A cafe in Friday Harbor, Washington is named \"Ernie's Cafe\" in his honor.\n\n\"Flying\" magazine ranked Gann thirty-fourth in its 2013 list of the 51 heroes of aviation.\n\n\nIsland in the Sky and Blaze of Noon were published as Armed Services Editions.\n\nGann contributed numerous articles to the aviation magazine \"Flying\". In one series, he described his exotic travels with Dodie in their Cessna 310, the \"Noon Balloon\", named because of its typically late departure time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The school's mascot is the Mustang.\n\nAfter World War II, the population of Dubuque moved further out to the west. The children born during the post-war baby boom also were in their late teens at the time. The community found that Senior High School would no longer be enough to serve the needs of the community.\n\nIn 1966, district employees were encouraged to offer their thoughts on the design of the new building. In the spring of 1967, a $6.7mio bond issue was approved to cover the costs of the building.\n\nThe school opened in 1969. Classes for students were initially held at Senior High School. In the spring of 1970, students began receiving education at Hempstead for the first time. In 1970, there was no graduating class because there was no senior class that first year. In the 1990s and mid 2005, structural improvements and expansions were made to the buildings. Over the next several years the school district has formulated plans to completely remodel the school.\n\nThe building is a three-level structure with an open courtyard in the center of the school. The second level contains classrooms, an indoor pool, gyms, art, music, driver education, and FHACS (Family Health & Consumer Sciences) classrooms. The third level holds the administrative offices, library/media center, math, science, business classrooms, a physical fitness room, cafeteria/commons area, industrial technology, wood working, and automobile shops. The third level also features an auditorium complex.\n\nHempstead features a 25-yard indoor swimming pool.

It is located behind the High altar of St. Mary's Basilica in Kraków. The altarpiece was carved between 1477 and 1489 by the German sculptor Veit Stoss (known in Polish as Wit Stwosz) who lived and worked in the city for over 20 years. \n\nIn 1941, during the German occupation, the dismantled altarpiece was shipped to the Third Reich on the order of Hans Frank – the Governor-General of that part of occupied Poland. It was recovered in 1946 in Bavaria, hidden in the basement of the heavily bombed Nuremberg Castle. The High Altar underwent major restoration work in Poland and was put back in its place at the Basilica 10 years later.\n\nA few weeks prior to the outbreak of the Second World War and the German occupation of Poland, the Poles took the altarpiece apart and stored its main statues in crates dispersed across the country. The crates were located by a Nazi unit called the \"Sonderkommando Paulsen,\" plundered and transported to the Third Reich, likely to Berlin. The panels were also found and sent to Germany. They were put in the basement of the Nuremberg Castle. At the castle, Polish prisoners sent messages to members of the Polish resistance that the revered altarpiece was hidden there. The altarpiece survived the war in spite of heavy bombardment of Nuremberg, and was discovered by Count Emeryk Hutten-Czapski, who was attached to the Polish 1st Armoured Division, and it was returned to Poland in 1946, where it underwent major restoration. It was put back at St. Mary's Basilica in 1957.\n\nThe altarpiece was restored several times in its history, not only after the end of World War II. For the first time, it was renovated before 1600, then in , 1932–1933, 1946–1949, 1999 and finally, in 2017.\n\nSt. John Cantius in Chicago, a historic church in the 'Polish Cathedral' style contains a detailed copy of this masterpiece. This one-third scale copy is the largest and most detailed work of its kind, and was commissioned in 2003 as a tribute to the immigrants from the Galicia region of Poland and Ukraine who founded the parish in 1893.\n\nThe Veit Stoss Altarpiece is about 13 m high and 11 m wide when the panels of the triptych are completely opened. The realistically sculptured figures are 2.7 m (more than 12 ft.) high; each one was carved out of a tree trunk of lime (linden). Other parts of the altarpiece are made from oak wood, and the background is constructed of larch wood. When closed, the panels show 12 scenes of the life of Jesus and Mary.\n\nThe scene at the bottom of the main altarpiece (centre) shows the death of Jesus' mother, Mary, in the presence of the Twelve Apostles. The upper centre part illustrates the Assumption of the Madonna. At the very top, outside the main frame, the coronation of Mary is shown, flanked by figures of Saint Stanislaus and Saint Adalbert of Prague. The side panels show the six scenes of the Joys of Mary:\n\n"}

Afa and Robin Goldroker (25 May 1961 – 3 June 2018), was a Polish musician and singer-songwriter, co-founder of bands Kryzys, Brygada Kryzys, Izrael and Armia.\n\nIn May 2012, Brylewski's autobiography, titled \"Kryzys w Babilonie\" (\"Crisis in Babylon\"), was published by the Wydawnictwo Literackie publishing house. The book has 584 pages and is based on a conversation between Brylewski and Polish Playboy journalist Rafał Księżyk. In the book, Brylewski answers numerous questions about his childhood, youth, music, and private life.\n\nBrylewski's father Waldemar was born in Czeladź, Zagłębie Dąbrowskie, while his mother Hanna is from Warsaw. The two met in the 1950s, while dancing for the famous Śląsk Song and Dance Ensemble. Robert was their only child, and the future musician, even though born in Warsaw, spent most of his childhood in a castle at Koszęcin, where all members of the ensemble lived. Brylewski returned to Warsaw with his mother in the early 1970s; his parents divorced when he was 13, and Robert admitted in the book that as a teenager, he had a lot of freedom, as his mother toured Poland, dancing and singing, and his father remained at Koszęcin. Brylewski attended Warsaw's renowned 11th High School, but did not graduate, because, as he claims, while still there, he decided not to pursue any career or go to college, but to become a musician.\n\nAs a teenager, Brylewski played association football, was a member of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association, and later on, became interested in rock music. In the early 1970s, his father spent some time in the United States, from where he brought several records. At that time, rock shows were frequently organized at Warsaw's Congress Hall, and Brylewski attended them, as well as Warsaw's Jazz Jamboree Festival. To avoid military service, which was obligatory in Communist Poland, he faked mental illness.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Brylewski read an article in Życie Warszawy about British punk rock movement. Impressed by the music of The Clash, Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks and other bands, he went to see the first punk rock concert in Poland, featuring The Raincoats (April 1, 1978, at Riviera Remont Student Culture Center in Warsaw). After the show, he decided to start his own band, together with students of a high school from Wilanów, Kamil Stoor and Paweł \"Kelner\" Rozwadowski. They named their band \"The Boors\", and after Stoor had left Poland for Sweden, with a new lineup, the band was renamed into Kryzys (\"Crisis\", May 1979). Due to the connections of band's manager, Jacek Olechowski (brother of Andrzej Olechowski), Kryzys toured Poland in 1979 – 1981, with such bands, as Kombi, Turbo, Exodus, and singers, such as John Porter, and Izabela Trojanowska. Brylewski wrote music for Kryzys, while lyrics were authored by the band's drummer, Maciej \"Magura\" Góralski. In 1981, they played at National Festival of Polish Song in Opole, together with Dżem, Perfect and Bank.\n\nKryzys ceased to exist in July 1981, and in early August 1981, Brylewski knocked on the door of the flat of Tomasz \"Frantz\" Lipiński (son of Eryk Lipiński), whose own band, Tilt, had been dissolved at that time as well. During the first meeting, both musicians agreed to start a new band. Since manager Jacek Orzechowski insisted on keeping the word Kryzys, Lipiński suggested adding the word Brygada, therefore Brygada Kryzys (\"Crisis Brigade\") was born. The leaders of the band described its music as \"punkadelic\", and first show took place in September 1981 at Riviera Remont Student Culture Center in Warsaw, together with Republika. The concert was recorded and illegally published in Great Britain, as \"Brygada Kryzys Live\". In November 1981, Brygada Kryzys toured Poland together with a British band \"TV 21\". During the tour, Brylewski was badly beaten in a restaurant at a hotel in Gdańsk. Then, in early December 1981, Brygada Kryzys went to Belgrade, to participate in the \"Days of Young Polish Culture\". The bus with both Brygada Kryzys and Maanam was not allowed entry into Czechoslovakia at the border crossing in Cieszyn, so it had to return to Warsaw, from where Brygada Kryzys flew to Belgrade. As Brylewski said in his autobiography: \"The spirit of Josip Broz Tito was still in the air, but they all sensed that after his death, the country would break into pieces. They welcomed us as stars, as a legend\". (page 126). On December 20, 1981 (see Martial Law in Poland), Brylewski was beaten up by the Communist police.\n\nUnlike such bands, as Maanam, TSA, Republika or Lombard, Brygada Kryzys refused to play at government-sponsored shows. The band recorded its first album in February – March 1982 (due to the color of the cover, it was called the \"Black Album\" or the \"Black Brygada\"), and in the summer of that year, the band left for the village of Wólki, near Lublin. The situation of the martial law, however, was not good, and in the autumn of 1982, Lipiński decided to split from the band. Brygada Kryzys ceased to exist, as Brylewski later said in his autobiography: \"I was expecting this to happen. I sensed that Tomek was feeling down, and I was not surprised. Nothing was happening with Brygada, I bore that situation better than Tomek, while it all frustrated him, he was older, he counted on something more. One day he just packed his guitar and said it was all over\". (page 155).\n\nAfter dissolution of Brygada Kryzys, Brylewski shortly played in a band called Anarchia. In early spring of 1983, together with Paweł \"Kelner\" Rozwadowski, they founded reggae band Izrael. The name was invented by Brylewski in March 1983. As he said in his biography, he had used to listen to ska music, such bands, as The Specials, The Beat, or Madness. He also liked The Clash, and as he says, in reggae he found independent culture, which was not created by the government or by the market. He began to wear dreadlocks, but never used to call himself a rastaman. At that time (1983–1985), Brylewski used to read the Bible, the Koran and the Bhagavad Gita, he was also impressed by Pope John Paul II: \"In reggae I found independent culture, which was not created by government's agencies or the markets, but it was created by itself, on the street, and nothing could stop its expansion. Punk rock also was a spontaneous movement, not to be stopped. After punk rock, we were hungry for such energy. In reggae I was inspired by the energy of the music, and later I came to know that it was a widely understood culture, which was not only about entertainment, but also about spirituality, social and mental changes\" (page 174 of Brylewski's autobiography).\n\nIzrael was founded in March 1983, and in May of that year, its first LP, called \"Biada, Biada, Biada\" was recorded in a studio at Wawrzyszew, district of Warsaw (it also was the first album of a Polish reggae band, but was not published until 1985). Brylewski wrote songs for it together with Rozwadowski, at Kelner's apartment located in a Communist high rise at Sadyba: \"In 1983 there was nothing attractive happening. Communication was not easy, so I spent plenty of time with Kelner. We stayed at his apartment, practising together. I played the guitar, Kelner played the bass, and then we switched\". (page 193). Soon after recording the album, Izrael toured Poland, together with Misty in Roots (summer 1983).\n\nDuring one of band's shows, which took place in Kraków, Brylewski met his future wife Vivian Quarcoo, a Polish-African singer in a jazz band. She began to sing with Izrael, and after some time, moved in with Robert. Their first daughter Sara was born in 1986, second daughter Ewa, in 1990. In 1984 – 1986, Izrael toured Poland, playing at various festivals, including FAMA at Świnoujście, Jarocin Festival, and Brodnica Music Camping. One of Izrael's concerts, which took place on May 9, 1986, at Opole, was broken down by the ZOMO. In 1985, Brylewski began to cooperate with Dariusz Malejonek, who had his own reggae band, \"Kultura\". In the course of the time, the two bands merged, keeping the name Izrael. Together with bandmates, Brylewski did not drink a lot of alcohol, smoking marijuana instead. As he said in his autobiography: \"Smoking marijuana had special importance for us. It built new links, as grass functioned at that time in different circumstances than now. People would not sell it to each other, they shared it\". (page 235).\n\nIn the summer 1985, Izrael recorded its second album, \"Nabij faję\" (\"Fill up the pipe\"). Almost all songs were written by Brylewski, who also created its cover. The album was recorded in Poznań, due to band's cooperation with \"PolJazz\" publishing house. Soon afterwards, Brylewski co-produced Fala, a compilation album: \"These were times full of naivety, times without divisions, as the Church and Solidarity were one front. We were young and inexperienced, we did not know that in times of threat everything looked different than in times of peace\". (page 248).\n\nThe Jarocin Festival in 1984 was marked by performances of two bands, Izrael and Siekiera. After Siekiera's show, Brylewski went to talk to members of the band, later inviting Siekiera to Warsaw's Róbrege Festival. Soon afterwards Brylewski noticed that Siekiera's leaders, Tomasz Adamski and Tomasz Budzyński did not get along well, and at some point Budzyński suggested starting a band with Brylewski. Thus Armia (also called \"Antiarmia\") was created, together with Sławomir Gołaszewski, Brygada Kryzys drummer Janusz Rołt, and Izrael's bassists Tomasz Żmijewski and Alik Dziki. As Brylewski said in the autobiography: \"At first Armia was a refreshing new idea, the return to my roots. This music was free from any schools and styles, we used sounds and chords that were not played by regular musicians (...) Our sound was like a thick, concrete wall, with maximum energy. Main point was not to play any guitar solos, as we ran away from rock. We had an impression that we no longer chased the West, it was Western musicians who had to keep up with us\". (pages 253 – 254).\n\nTogether with Budzyński, Robert Brylewski was at that time impressed with Aguirre, the Wrath of God (this film influenced Armia's lyrics), books of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, Native American culture and Christianity. As he says, first Armia's recordings of 1985 showed that the band already had a plan for its sound: \"After the first single, it was obvious that Armia would create its own world, like Izrael did. We played what we called \"a fairy tale music\" (...) I associated Armia with forces of nature (...) I do not remember how Indians appeared in the band. I guess we all had in minds the notion of noble Winnetou, so Indian symbols dominated in our graphic designs\". (pages 259 – 262)\n\nIn 1987, Armia recorded its first LP, \"Aguirre\", at one of the first Polish private studios in Rzeszów. Since Izrael and Deuter also recorded their LPs there, Brylewski, who continued to be a member of Izrael, altogether spent two months in Rzeszów, having been arrested there twice. Apart from \"Aguirre\", Brylewski recorded another Izrael's LP, \"Duchowa rewolucja\", cooperating closely with Dariusz Malejonek, who had previously been leader of another reggae band, \"Kultura\". At 1985 Jarocin Festival, Izrael and Kultura merged, keeping the name Izrael.\n\nFor most of the 1980s, all Brylewski's bands practiced at the \"Hybrydy Student Culture Center\" in Warsaw. In 1983 the club began to organize the annual \"Róbrege Festival\", and Brylewski, together with Rozwadowski were responsible for the selection of bands: \"The rule was that on the first day of the festival, punk rock bands were presented. On the second day – reggae, on the third day – different music genres. Bands were recommended to us from different people, so the guys from Dezerter suggested Kortatu (...) Róbrege always took place in the autumn, after the Jarocin Festivals, where we got in touch with people, listened to bands\". (page 279)\n\nIn the mid-1980s Brylewski opened his own recording studio \"Złota Skała\" (\"Gold Rock\"), issuing first Armia's tapes in 1986. Since most underground bands in Communist Poland were unable to have their songs published by official companies, Brylewski decided to help them, recording and then publishing their work. At the same time, together with Rozwadowski, he created a music project \"T-34\", named after a famous Soviet tank. In 1988, Brylewski went to London, as he stated: \"because I wanted to see this city and buy a good guitar\" (page 289). For two months he worked at a construction site, living in the district of Brixton. After coming back to Poland, he left Warsaw and with family moved to the village of Stanclewo, located in historic province of Masuria. Together with other musicians, he opened there the \"Gold Rock\" studio, and stayed at Stanclewo for two years (1988–1990): \"More and more often I remained at Stanclewo, only with wife and children, which was troublesome. Without the band, I had little to do there. At that time communication was difficult, but still I was the last of those settlers, who gave up, only after Izrael's practices in Warsaw began to take place without me\". (pages 312 – 313)\n\n"}
{"id": "2068718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068718", "title": "Temple of Castor and Pollux", "text": "Temple of Castor and Pollux\n\nThe Temple of Castor and Pollux () is an ancient temple in the Roman Forum, Rome, central Italy. It was originally built in gratitude for victory at the Battle of Lake Regillus (495 BC). Castor and Pollux (Greek Polydeuces) were the Dioscuri, the \"twins\" of Gemini, the twin sons of Zeus (Jupiter) and Leda. Their cult came to Rome from Greece via Magna Graecia and the Greek culture of Southern Italy.\n\nThe Roman temple is one of a number of known Dioscuri temples remaining from antiquity.\n\nThe last king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, and his allies, the Latins, waged war on the infant Roman Republic. Before the battle, the Roman dictator Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis vowed to build a temple to the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux) if the Republic were victorious.\n\nAccording to legend, Castor and Pollux appeared on the battlefield as two able horsemen in aid of the Republic; and after the battle had been won they again appeared on the Forum in Rome watering their horses at the Spring of Juturna thereby announcing the victory. The temple stands on the supposed spot of their appearance.\n\nOne of Postumius’ sons was elected duumvir in order to dedicate the temple on 15 July (the ides of July) 484 BC.\nDuring the Republican period, the temple served as a meeting place for the Roman Senate, and from the middle of the 2nd century BC the front of the podium served as a speaker's platform. During the imperial period, the temple housed the office for weights and measures, and was a depository for the State treasury. Chambers located between the foundation piers of the temple were used to conduct this business. Based on finds from the drains, one of the chambers was likely used by a dentist.\n\nThe archaic temple was completely reconstructed and enlarged in 117 BC by Lucius Caecilius Metellus Dalmaticus after his victory over the Dalmatians. Gaius Verres again restored this second temple in 73 BC.\n\nCommemorating the initial victory at Lake Regillus, a large calvary parade was held each year on July 15th and featured as many as 5,000 young men carrying shields and spears. Two young men, riding white horses, led the parade and represented Castor and Pollux.\n\nIn 14 BC a fire that ravaged major parts of the forum destroyed the temple, and Tiberius, the son of Livia by a previous marriage and adopted son of Augustus and the eventual heir to the throne, rebuilt it. Tiberius' temple was dedicated in 6 AD. The remains visible today are from the temple of Tiberius, except the podium, which is from the time of Metellus.\n\nIn conjunction with this imperial rebuilding, the cult itself became associated with the imperial family. Initially, the twins were identified with Augustus's intended heirs, Gaius and Lucius Caesar. After their premature deaths, however, the association with Castor and Pollux passed to Tiberius and his brother Drusus.\n\nAccording to Edward Gibbon, the temple of Castor served as a secret meeting place for the Roman Senate. Frequent meetings of the Senate are also reported by Cicero. Gibbon said the senate was roused to rebellion against Emperor Maximinus Thrax and in favor of future emperor Gordian I at the Temple of Castor in 237 AD.\n\nIf still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. The temple was possibly already falling apart in the fourth century, when a wall in front of the Lacus Juturnae was erected from reused material. Nothing is known of its subsequent history, except that in the 15th century, only three columns of its original structure were still standing. The street running by the building was called \"via Trium Columnarum\".\n\nIn 1760, the Conservatori, finding the columns in a state of imminent collapse, erected scaffolding for effecting repairs. Both Piranesi and the young English architect George Dance the Younger were able to climb up and make accurate measurements; Dance had \"a Model cast from the finest Example of the Corinthian order perhaps in the whole World\", as he reported to his father.\n\nToday the podium survives without the facing, as do the three columns and a piece of the entablature, one of the most famous features in the Forum.\n\nThe octastyle temple was peripteral, with eight Corinthian columns at the short sides and eleven on the long sides. There was a single cella paved with mosaics. The podium measures and in height. The building was constructed in \"opus caementicium\" and originally covered with slabs of tuff which were later removed. According to ancient sources, the temple had a single central stairway to access the podium, but excavations have identified two side stairs. \n\nThe temple complex was excavated and studied between 1983 and 1989 by a joint archaeological mission of the Nordic academies in Rome, led by Inge Nielsen and B. Poulsen.\n\nThe Roman temple is one of a number of known Dioscuri sites remaining from antiquity. Among others,\n\n\nIn his 1888 description of the Dioscuri temple in ancient Greek colonial city of Naucratis in Egypt, Ernest Arthur Gardner remarked that such temples were common enough to have a characteristic orientation. Temples to the gods tended to face east. Temples to heroes and demi-gods such as Castor and Pollux faced west.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2068719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068719", "title": "Cheletropic reaction", "text": "Cheletropic reaction\n\nCheletropic reactions also known as chelotropic reactions are a type of pericyclic reaction. A pericyclic reaction is one that involves a transition state with a cyclic array of atoms and an associated cyclic array of interacting orbitals. A reorganization of σ and π bonds occurs in this cyclic array.\n\nSpecifically, cheletropic reactions are a subclass of cycloadditions. The key distinguishing feature of cheletropic reactions is that on one of the reagents, both new bonds are being made to the same atom. A few examples are shown to the right. In the first case, the single atom is the carbonyl carbon that ends up in carbon monoxide. The end result is making two new bonds to one atom. The first two examples are known as cheletropic extrusions because a small stable molecule is given off in the reaction. The driving force for these reactions is often the entropic benefit of gaseous evolution (e.g. CO or N).\n\nIn the pericyclic transition state, a small molecule donates two electrons to the ring. The reaction process can be shown using two different geometries, the small molecule can approach in a linear or non-linear fashion. In the linear approach, the electrons in the orbital of the small molecule are pointed directly at the π-system. In the non-linear approach, the orbital approaches at a skew angle. The π-system's ability to rotate as the small molecule approaches is crucial in forming new bonds. The direction of rotation will be different depending on how many π-electrons are in the system. Shown below is a diagram of a two-electron fragment approaching a four-electron π-system using frontier molecular orbitals. The rotation will be disrotatory if the small molecule approaches linearly and conrotatory if the molecule approaches non-linearly. Disrotatory and conrotatory are sophisticated terms expressing how the bonds in the π-system are rotating. Disrotatory means opposite directions while conrotatory means the same direction. This is also depicted in the diagram below.\n\nUsing Hückel's Rule, one can tell if the π-system is aromatic or antiaromatic. If aromatic, linear approaches use disrotatory motion while non-linear approaches use conrotatory motion. The opposite goes with an anti-aromatic system. Linear approaches will have conrotatory motion while non-linear approaches will have disrotatory motion.\n\nIn 1995, Suarez and Sordo showed that sulfur dioxide when reacted with butadiene and isoprene gives two different products depending on the mechanism. This was shown experimentally and using \"ab initio\" calculations. A kinetic and thermodynamic product are both possible, but the thermodynamic product is more favorable. The kinetic product arises from a Diels-Alder reaction, while a cheletropic reaction gives rise to a more thermodynamically stable product. The cheletropic pathway is favored because it gives rise to a more stable five-membered ring adduct. The scheme below shows the difference between the two products, the path to the right shows the more stable thermodynamic product, while the path to the left shows the kinetic product.\n\nThe cheletropic reactions of 1,3-dienes with sulfur dioxide have been extensively investigated in terms of kinetics (see above for general reaction).\n\nIn the first quantitative measurement of kinetic parameters for this reaction, a 1976 study by Isaacs and Laila measured the rates of addition of sulfur dioxide to butadiene derivatives. Rates of addition were monitored in benzene at 30 °C with an initial twentyfold excess of sulfur dioxide, allowing for a pseudo first-order approximation. The disappearance of SO was followed spectrophotometrically at 320 nm. The reaction showed pseudo first-order kinetics. Some interesting results were that electron-withdrawing groups on the diene decreased the rate of reaction. Also, the reaction rate was affected considerably by steric effects of 2-substituents, with more bulky groups increasing the rate of reaction. The authors attribute this to the tendency of bulky groups to favor the cisoid conformation of the diene which is essential to the reaction (see table below). In addition, the rates at four temperatures were measured for seven of the dienes permitting calculations of the enthalpy of activation (ΔH) and entropy of activation (ΔS) for these reactions through the Arrhenius equation.\n\nMore recently, a 2002 study by Monnat, Vogel, and Sordo measured the kinetics of addition of sulfur dioxide to 1,2-dimethylidenecycloalkanes. An interesting point presented in this paper is that the reaction of 1,2-dimethylidenecyclohexane with sulfur dioxide can give two different products depending on reaction conditions. The reaction produces the corresponding sulfine through a hetero-Diels-Alder reaction under kinetic control (≤ -60 °C), but, under thermodynamic control (≥ -40 °C), the reaction produces the corresponding sulfolene through a cheletropic reaction. The activation enthalpy for the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction is about 8 kJ/mol smaller than that for the corresponding cheletropic reaction. The sulfolene is about 40 kJ/mol more stable than the isometric sulfine in CHCl/SO solution.\n\nThe authors were able to experimentally determine a rate law at 261.2 K for the reaction of 1,2-dimethylidenecyclohexane with sulfur dioxide to give the corresponding sulfolene. The reaction was first order in 1,2-dimethylidenecyclohexane but second order in sulfur dioxide (see below). This confirmed a prediction based on high-level \"ab initio\" quantum calculations. Using computational methods, the authors proposed a transition structure for the cheletropic reaction of 1,2-dimethylidenecyclohexane with sulfur dioxide (see figure at right). The reaction is second order in sulfur dioxide because another molecule of sulfur dioxide likely binds to the transition state to help stabilize it. Similar results were found in a 1995 study by Suarez, Sordo, and Sordo which used \"ab initio\" calculations to study the kinetic and thermodynamic control of the reaction of sulfur dioxide with 1,3-dienes.\n\nThe effect of the solvent of the cheletropic reaction of 3,4-dimethyl-2,5-dihydrothiophen-1,1-dioxide (shown at right) was kinetically investigated in 14 solvents. The reaction rate constants of the forward and reverse reaction in addition to the equilibrium constants were found to be linearly correlated with the E(30) solvent polarity scale.\n\nReactions were done at 120 °C and were studied by 1H-NMR spectroscopy of the reaction mixture. The forward rate k was found to decrease by a factor of 4.5 going from cyclohexane to methanol. The reverse rate k was found to increase by a factor of 53 going from cyclohexane to methanol, while the equilibrium constant K decreased by a factor of 140. It is suggested that there is a change of the polarity during the activation process as evidenced by correlations between the equilibrium and kinetic data. The authors remark that the reaction appears to be influenced by the polarity of the solvent, and this can be explained by the change in the dipole moments when going from reactant to transition state to product. The authors also state that the cheletropic reaction doesn’t seem to be influenced by either solvent acidity or basicity.\n\nThe results of this study lead the authors to expect the following behaviors:\n\n1. The change in the solvent polarity will influence the rate less than the equilibrium.\n\n2. The rate constants will be characterized by opposite effect on the polarity: k will slightly decrease with the increase of E(30), and k will increase under the same conditions.\n\n3. The effect on k will be larger than on k.\n\nOne of the most synthetically important cheletropic reactions is the addition of a singlet carbene to an alkene to make a cyclopropane (see figure at left). A carbene is a neutral molecule containing a divalent carbon with six electrons in its valence shell. Due to this, carbenes are highly reactive electrophiles and generated as reaction intermediates. A singlet carbene contains an empty \"p\" orbital and a roughly \"sp\" hybrid orbital that has two electrons. Singlet carbenes add stereospecifically to alkenes, and alkene stereochemistry is retained in the cyclopropane product. The mechanism for addition of a carbene to an alkene is a concerted [2+1] cycloaddition (see figure). Carbenes derived from chloroform or bromoform can be used to add CX to an alkene to give a dihalocyclopropane, while the Simmons-Smith reagent adds CH.\n\nInteraction of the filled carbene orbital with the alkene π system creates a four-electron system and favors a non-linear approach. It is also favorable to mix the carbene empty \"p\" orbital with the filled alkene π orbital. Favorable mixing occurs through a non-linear approach (see figure at right). However, while theory clearly favors a non-linear approach, there are no obvious experimental implications for a linear vs. non-linear approach.\n"}

The Dhegiha Siouan-speaking tribe historically migrated from the Ohio Valley area to the west side of the Mississippi River and resettled in what is now the state of Arkansas; their name for themselves refers to this migration and traveling downriver.\n\nThe Quapaw are federally recognized as the Quapaw Nation. The US federal government removed them to Indian Territory in 1834, and their tribal base has been in present-day Ottawa County in northeastern Oklahoma. The number of members enrolled in the tribe was 3,240 in 2011.\n\nAlgonquian-speaking people called the Quapaws /akansa/, and the French called them Arcansas. The French named the Arkansas River and the territory and state of Arkansas for them.\n\nThe Quapaw Nation is headquartered in Quapaw in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, in the northeast corner of the state. They have a Quapaw tribal jurisdictional area.\n\nThe Quapaw people elect a tribal council and the tribal chairman, who serves a two-year term. The governing body of the tribe is outlined in the governing resolutions of the tribe, which were voted upon and approved in 1956 to create a written form of government (prior to 1956 the Quapaw Tribe operated on a hereditary chief system). The Chairman is John L. Berrey. Of the 3,240 enrolled tribal members, 892 live in the state of Oklahoma. Membership in the tribe is based on lineal descent.\n\nThe tribe operates a Tribal Police Department and a Fire Department, which handles both fire and EMS calls. They issue their own tribal vehicle tags and have their own housing authority.\n\nThe tribe owns two smoke shops and motor fuel outlets, known as the Quapaw C-Store and Downstream Q-Store.\n\nThey have two casinos, the Quapaw Casino and the Downstream Casino Resort, both located in Quapaw; these generate most of the revenue for the tribe. In 2012 the Quapaw Tribe's annual economic impact was measured at more than $225,000,000. They also own and operate the Eagle Creek Golf Course and resort, located in Loma Linda, Missouri.\n\nThe Tar Creek Superfund site has been listed by the Environmental Protection Agency for clean-up of environmental hazards. European-Americans leased lands for development that require remediation to remove toxic waste.\n\nThe traditional Quapaw language is part of the Dhegiha branch of the Siouan language family. There are few remaining native speakers, but Quapaw was well documented in fieldnotes and publications from many individuals, including George Izard in 1827, Lewis F. Hadley in 1882, 19th-century linguist James Owen Dorsey, Frank T. Siebert in 1940, and by linguist Robert Rankin in the 1970s.\n\nClasses in the Quapaw language are taught at the tribal museum. An online audio lexicon of the Quapaw language was created by editing old recordings of Elders speaking the language.\n\nOther efforts at language preservation and revitalization are being undertaken. In 2011 the Quapaw participated in the first annual Dhegiha Gathering. The Osage language program hosted and organized the gathering, held at the Quapaw tribe's Downstream Casino. Language-learning techniques and other issues were discussed and taught in workshops at the conference among the five cognate tribes. The Annual Dhegiha Gathering was held in 2012 also at Downstream Casino.\n\nThe Quapaw host cultural events throughout the year, primarily held at the tribal museum. These include Indian dice games, traditional singing, and classes in traditional arts, such as finger weaving, shawl making, and flute making. In addition, Quapaw language classes are held there.\n\nThe tribe's annual dance is during the weekend of the Fourth of July. This dance started shortly after the American Civil War, 2011 was the 139th anniversary of this dance. Common features of this powwow include gourd dance, war dance, stomp dance, and 49s. Other activities take place such as Indian football, handgame, traditional footraces, traditional dinners, turkey dance, and other dances such as Quapaw Dance, and dances from other area tribes.\n\nThis weekend is also when the tribe convenes the annual general council meeting, during which important decisions regarding the policies and resolutions of the Quapaw tribe are voted upon by tribal members over the age of eighteen.\n\nThe Quapaw Nation (known as \"\" in their own language) are descended from a historical group of Dhegian-Siouan speaking people who lived in the lower Ohio River valley area. The modern descendants of this group also include the Omaha, Ponca, Osage and Kaw. The Quapaw and the other Dhegiha Siouan speaking tribes are believed to have migrated from the Ohio River valley after 1200 CE. Scholars are divided in whether they think the Quapaw and other related groups left before or after the Beaver Wars of the 17th century, in which the more powerful Five Nations of the Iroquois drove out other tribes from the Ohio Valley and retained the area for hunting grounds.\n\nThey arrived at their historical territory, the area of the confluence of the Arkansas and Mississippi rivers, at minimum by the mid-17th century. The timing of the Quapaw migration into their ancestral territory in the historical period has been the subject of considerable debate by scholars of various fields. It is referred to as the \"Quapaw Paradox\" by academics. Many professional archaeologists have introduced numerous migration scenarios and time frames, but none has conclusive evidence. Glottochronological studies suggest the Quapaw separated from the other Dhegihan-speaking peoples ranging between AD 950 to as late as AD 1513.\n\nThe Illinois and other Algonquian-speaking peoples to the northeast referred to them as the ' or ', meaning \"land of the downriver people\". As French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet met the Illinois before they did the Quapaw, they adopted this exonym for the more westerly people. English-speaking settlers who arrived later in the region adopted the name used by the French.\n\nDuring years of colonial rule of New France, many of the French fur traders and \"voyageurs\" had an amicable relationship with the Quapaw, as with many other trading tribes. Many Quapaw women and French men married and had families together. Pine Bluff, Arkansas, was founded by Joseph Bonne, a man of Quapaw-French ancestry.\n\n\"Écore Fabre\" (Fabre's Bluff) was started as a trading post by the Frenchman Fabre and was one of the first European settlements in south central Arkansas. While the area was ruled by the Spanish from 1763–1789, following French defeat in the Seven Years' War, they did not have as many colonists in the area. After increased American settlement following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, Écore Fabre was renamed as Camden.\n\nEnglish speakers tried to adapt French names to English phonetics: ' (French for \"covered way or road\") was gradually converted to \"Smackover\" by Anglo-Americans. They used this name for a local creek. Founded by the French, ' was translated into English and renamed by Americans as Little Rock after the United States acquired the territory in the Purchase.\n\nNumerous spelling variations have been recorded in accounts of tribal names, reflecting both loose spelling traditions, and the effects of transliteration of names into the variety of European languages used in the area. Some sources listed \"Ouachita\" as a Choctaw word, whereas others list it as a Quapaw word. Either way, the spelling reflects transliteration into French.\n\nThe following passages are taken from the public domain \"Catholic Encyclopedia\", written early in the 20th century. It describes the Quapaw from the non-native perspective of that time. Some of the tribe has strong Cherokee kin relationships then and now.\n\nA tribe now nearly extinct, but formerly one of the most important of the lower Mississippi region, occupying several villages about the mouth of the Arkansas, chiefly on the west (Arkansas) side, with one or two at various periods on the east (Mississippi) side of the Mississippi, and claiming the whole of the Arkansas River region up to the border of the territory held by the Osage in the north-western part of the state. They are of Siouan linguistic stock, speaking the same language, spoken also with dialectic variants, by the Osage and Kansa (Kaw) in the south and by the Omaha and Ponca in Nebraska. Their name properly is \"Ugakhpa\", which signifies \"down-stream people\", as distinguished from \"Umahan\" or Omaha, \"up-stream people\". To the Illinois and other Algonquian tribes, they were known as 'Akansea', whence their French names of \"Akensas\" and \"Akansas\". According to concurrent tradition of the cognate tribes, the Quapaw and their kinsmen originally lived far east, possibly beyond the Alleghenies, and, pushing gradually westward, descended the Ohio River – hence called by the Illinois the \"river of the Akansea\" – to its junction with the Mississippi, whence the Quapaw, then including the Osage and Kansa, descended to the mouth of the Arkansas, while the Omaha, with the Ponca, went up the Missouri.\n\nIn 1541, when the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto led an expedition that came across the town of Pacaha (also recorded by Garcilaso as Capaha), between the Mississippi River and a lake on the Arkansas side, apparently in present-day Phillips County. His party describe the village as strongly palisaded and nearly surrounded by a ditch. Archaeological remains and local conditions bear out the description. If the migration out of the Ohio Valley preceded the \"entrada\", these people may have been the proto-Quapaw. However, given the use of the Tunica language in Pacaha and the evidence for a late Quapaw migration to Arkansas, it is likely that the people whom de Soto met were Tunica.\n\nThe first certain encounters with Quapaw by Europeans occurred more than 130 years later. In 1673, the Jesuit Father Jacques Marquette accompanied the French commander Louis Jolliet in making his noted voyage down the Mississippi. He reportedly went to the villages of the \"Akansea\", who gave him warm welcome and listened with attention to his sermons, while he stayed with them a few days. In 1682 La Salle passed by their villages, then five in number, of which one was on the east bank of the Mississippi. A Recollect father, Zenobius Membré, who accompanied the LaSalle expediton planted a cross and attempted to convert the Native Americans to Christianity.\n\nThe commander negotiated a peace with the tribe and formally \"claimed\" the territory for France. The Quapaw were uniformly kind and friendly toward the French. In spite of frequent shiftings, there were four Quapaw villages generally reported along the Mississippi River in this early period. They corresponded in name and population to four sub-tribes still existing, listed as ', ', ', and ', or, under their French transliterations: Kappa, Ossoteoue, Touriman, and Tonginga. Kappa was reported to have been on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River and the other three located on the western bank in or near present-day Desha County, Arkansas. In 1721 depopulation led to the consolidation of Tourima and Tongigua into one village. Ossoteoue or Osotouy was situated at the mouth of the Arkansas River and is now thought to be an archaeological site known as the Menard-Hodges Mounds.\n\nIn 1686 the French commander Henri de Tonti built a post on the Arkansas River, near its mouth, that later was known as the Arkansas Post. This began European occupation of the Quapaw country. Tonti arranged also for a resident Jesuit missionary, but apparently without result. About 1697 a smallpox epidemic killed the greater part of the women and children of two villages. In 1727 the Jesuits, from their house in New Orleans, again took up the missionary work. In 1729 the Quapaw allied with the French against the Natchez, resulting in the practical extermination of the Natchez.\n\nThe French relocated the Arkansas Post upriver, trying to avoid flooding. After losing to the British in the Seven Years' War, France ceded its North American territories to Britain. This nation exchanged territory with Spain, which took over \"control\" of Arkansas and other former French territory west of the Mississippi River. It built new forts to protect its valued trading post with the Quapaw.\n\nShortly after the United States acquired the territory in 1803 by the Louisiana Purchase, it recorded the Quapaw as living in three villages on the south side of the Arkansas River about above Arkansas Post. In 1818, they made their first treaty with the US government, ceding all claims from the Red River to beyond the Arkansas and east of the Mississippi.\n\nThey kept a considerable tract between the Arkansas and the Saline, in the southeastern part of the state. Under continued US pressure, in 1824 they ceded this also, excepting occupied by the chief Saracen (Sarrasin) below Pine Bluff. They expected to incorporate with the Caddo of Louisiana, but were refused permission. Successive floods in the Caddo country near the Red River pushed many toward starvation, and they wandered back to their old homes.\n\nIn 1834, under another treaty, the Quapaw were removed from the Mississippi valley areas to their present location in the northeast corner of Oklahoma, then Indian Territory.\n\n\"Sarrasin\" (alternate spelling Saracen), their last chief before the removal, was a Roman Catholic and friend of the Lazarist missionaries (Congregation of the Missions), who had arrived in 1818. He died about 1830 and is buried adjoining St. Joseph's Church, Pine Bluff, where a memorial window preserves his name. The pioneer Lazarist missionary among the Quapaw was Rev. John M. Odin, who later served as the Archbishop of New Orleans.\n\nIn 1824 the Jesuits of Maryland, under Father Charles Van Quickenborne, took up work among the native and immigrant tribes of present-day Kansas and Oklahoma. In 1846 the Mission of St. Francis was established among the Osage, on Neosho River, by Fathers John Shoenmakers and John Bax, who extended their services to the Quapaw for some years. The Quapaw together with the associated remnant tribes, the Miami, Seneca, Wyandot and Ottawa, were served from the Mission of \"Saint Mary of the Quapaws\", at Quapaw, Oklahoma. Historians estimated their number at European encounter as 5000. The \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" noted the people had suffered from high fatalities due to epidemics, wars, removals, and social disruption. It documented their numbers as 3200 in 1687, 1600 in 1750, 476 in 1843, and 307 in 1910, including all mixed bloods.\nBesides the four established divisions already noted, the Quapaw have the clan system, with a number of \"gentes\". Polygamy was practiced, but was not common. They were agricultural. Their towns were palisaded. Their town houses, or public structures, are referred to as longhouses and are constructed with timbers dovetailed together and bark roofs, were commonly erected upon large man-made mounds to guard against the frequent flooding. Their ordinary houses were rectangular and long enough to accommodate several families.\n\nThe Quapaw dug large ditches, and constructed fish weirs to manage their food supply. They excelled in pottery and in the painting of hide for bed covers and other purposes. The dead were buried in the ground, sometimes in mounds or in the clay floors of their houses, being frequently strapped to a stake in a sitting position and then covered with earth. They were friendly to the Europeans, while warring with the Chickasaw and other Southeastern tribes over resources and trade.\n\nIn the early 20th century, an account noted that the Dhegiha language, a branch of Siouan including the \"dialects\" of the Omaha, Ponca, Osage, Kansa, and Quapaw, has received more extended study. Rev. J.O. Dorsey published material about it under the auspices of the Bureau of American Ethnology, now part of the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nThe Quapaw tribal jurisdictional area includes the Tar Creek Superfund Site, which at one time was considered to be the worst environmental disaster in the country. The city of Picher has been closed and abandoned, and the environmental issues related to mining are explored in the documentary \"Tar Creek\", made in 2009 by Matt Myers. \"Tar Creek\" tells the full story of the Tar Creek Superfund Site. It discusses the racism of environmental and governmental practices that led to the neglect and lack of regulation resulting in this hazardous site. The Quapaw and other residents of Ottawa County have suffered ill effects, including lead poisoning of a high percentage of children, from contamination of ground and water due to this site.\n\nIn 2018, Infinite Productions produced a documentary featuring the story behind the making of the Downstream Casino Resort, operated by The Quapaw Nation. Within the documentary the history of Downstream is told along with a focus on the industries outside of gaming that the tribe has further developed and participated in. The feature length film can be watched on Amazon Prime or YouTube. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NXD5TBF\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2068726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068726", "title": "History of Earth", "text": "History of Earth\n\nThe history of Earth concerns the development of planet Earth from its formation to the present day. Nearly all branches of natural science have contributed to understanding of the main events of Earth's past, characterized by constant geological change and biological evolution.\n\nThe geological time scale (GTS), as defined by international convention, depicts the large spans of time from the beginning of the Earth to the present, and its divisions chronicle some definitive events of Earth history. (In the graphic: Ga means \"billion years ago\"; Ma, \"million years ago\".) Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago, approximately one-third the age of the universe, by accretion from the solar nebula. Volcanic outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean, but the early atmosphere contained almost no oxygen. Much of the Earth was molten because of frequent collisions with other bodies which led to extreme volcanism. While the Earth was in its earliest stage (Early Earth), a giant impact collision with a planet-sized body named Theia is thought to have formed the Moon. Over time, the Earth cooled, causing the formation of a solid crust, and allowing liquid water on the surface.\n\nThe Hadean eon represents the time before a reliable (fossil) record of life; it began with the formation of the planet and ended 4.0 billion years ago. The following Archean and Proterozoic eons produced the beginnings of life on Earth and its earliest evolution. The succeeding eon is the Phanerozoic, divided into three eras: the Palaeozoic, an era of arthropods, fishes, and the first life on land; the Mesozoic, which spanned the rise, reign, and climactic extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs; and the Cenozoic, which saw the rise of mammals. Recognizable humans emerged at most 2 million years ago, a vanishingly small period on the geological scale.\n\nThe earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago, during the Eoarchean Era, after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon. There are microbial mat fossils such as stromatolites found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in southwestern Greenland as well as \"remains of biotic life\" found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia. According to one of the researchers, \"If life arose relatively quickly on Earth … then it could be common in the universe.\"\n\nPhotosynthetic organisms appeared between 3.2 and 2.4 billion years ago and began enriching the atmosphere with oxygen. Life remained mostly small and microscopic until about 580 million years ago, when complex multicellular life arose, developed over time, and culminated in the Cambrian Explosion about 541 million years ago. This sudden diversification of life forms produced most of the major phyla known today, and divided the Proterozoic Eon from the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era. It is estimated that 99 percent of all species that ever lived on Earth, over five billion, have gone extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million are documented, but over 86 percent have not been described. However, it was recently claimed that 1 trillion species currently live on Earth, with only one-thousandth of one percent described.\n\nThe Earth's crust has constantly changed since its formation, as has life since its first appearance. Species continue to evolve, taking on new forms, splitting into daughter species, or going extinct in the face of ever-changing physical environments. The process of plate tectonics continues to shape the Earth's continents and oceans and the life they harbor. Human activity is now a dominant force affecting global change, harming the biosphere, the Earth's surface, hydrosphere, and atmosphere with the loss of wild lands, over-exploitation of the oceans, production of greenhouse gases, degradation of the ozone layer, and general degradation of soil, air, and water quality.\nIn geochronology, time is generally measured in mya (million years ago), each unit representing the period of approximately 1,000,000 years in the past. The history of Earth is divided into four great eons, starting 4,540 mya with the formation of the planet. Each eon saw the most significant changes in Earth's composition, climate and life. Each eon is subsequently divided into eras, which in turn are divided into periods, which are further divided into epochs.\n\nThe history of the Earth can be organized chronologically according to the geologic time scale, which is split into intervals based on stratigraphic analysis.\n\nThe standard model for the formation of the Solar System (including the Earth) is the solar nebula hypothesis. In this model, the Solar System formed from a large, rotating cloud of interstellar dust and gas called the solar nebula. It was composed of hydrogen and helium created shortly after the Big Bang 13.8 Ga (billion years ago) and heavier elements ejected by supernovae. About 4.5 Ga, the nebula began a contraction that may have been triggered by the shock wave from a nearby supernova. A shock wave would have also made the nebula rotate. As the cloud began to accelerate, its angular momentum, gravity, and inertia flattened it into a protoplanetary disk perpendicular to its axis of rotation. Small perturbations due to collisions and the angular momentum of other large debris created the means by which kilometer-sized protoplanets began to form, orbiting the nebular center.\n\nThe center of the nebula, not having much angular momentum, collapsed rapidly, the compression heating it until nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium began. After more contraction, a T Tauri star ignited and evolved into the Sun. Meanwhile, in the outer part of the nebula gravity caused matter to condense around density perturbations and dust particles, and the rest of the protoplanetary disk began separating into rings. In a process known as runaway accretion, successively larger fragments of dust and debris clumped together to form planets. Earth formed in this manner about 4.54 billion years ago (with an uncertainty of 1%) and was largely completed within 10–20 million years. The solar wind of the newly formed T Tauri star cleared out most of the material in the disk that had not already condensed into larger bodies. The same process is expected to produce accretion disks around virtually all newly forming stars in the universe, some of which yield planets.\n\nThe proto-Earth grew by accretion until its interior was hot enough to melt the heavy, siderophile metals. Having higher densities than the silicates, these metals sank. This so-called \"iron catastrophe\" resulted in the separation of a primitive mantle and a (metallic) core only 10 million years after the Earth began to form, producing the layered structure of Earth and setting up the formation of Earth's magnetic field. J.A. Jacobs was the first to suggest that Earth's inner core—a solid center distinct from the liquid outer core—is freezing and growing out of the liquid outer core due to the gradual cooling of Earth's interior (about 100 degrees Celsius per billion years).\n\nThe first eon in Earth's history, the \"Hadean\", begins with the Earth's formation and is followed by the \"Archean\" eon at 3.8 Ga. The oldest rocks found on Earth date to about 4.0 Ga, and the oldest detrital zircon crystals in rocks to about 4.4 Ga, soon after the formation of the Earth's crust and the Earth itself. The giant impact hypothesis for the Moon's formation states that shortly after formation of an initial crust, the proto-Earth was impacted by a smaller protoplanet, which ejected part of the mantle and crust into space and created the Moon.\n\nFrom crater counts on other celestial bodies, it is inferred that a period of intense meteorite impacts, called the \"Late Heavy Bombardment\", began about 4.1 Ga, and concluded around 3.8 Ga, at the end of the Hadean. In addition, volcanism was severe due to the large heat flow and geothermal gradient. Nevertheless, detrital zircon crystals dated to 4.4 Ga show evidence of having undergone contact with liquid water, suggesting that the Earth already had oceans or seas at that time.\n\nBy the beginning of the Archean, the Earth had cooled significantly. Present life forms could not have survived at Earth's surface, because the Archean atmosphere lacked oxygen hence had no ozone layer to block ultraviolet light. Nevertheless, it is believed that primordial life began to evolve by the early Archean, with candidate fossils dated to around 3.5 Ga. Some scientists even speculate that life could have begun during the early Hadean, as far back as 4.4 Ga, surviving the possible Late Heavy Bombardment period in hydrothermal vents below the Earth's surface.\n\nEarth's only natural satellite, the Moon, is larger relative to its planet than any other satellite in the Solar System. During the Apollo program, rocks from the Moon's surface were brought to Earth. Radiometric dating of these rocks shows that the Moon is 4.53 ± 0.01 billion years old, formed at least 30 million years after the Solar System. New evidence suggests the Moon formed even later, 4.48 ± 0.02 Ga, or 70–110 million years after the start of the Solar System.\n\nTheories for the formation of the Moon must explain its late formation as well as the following facts. First, the Moon has a low density (3.3 times that of water, compared to 5.5 for the Earth) and a small metallic core. Second, there is virtually no water or other volatiles on the Moon. Third, the Earth and Moon have the same oxygen isotopic signature (relative abundance of the oxygen isotopes). Of the theories proposed to account for these phenomena, one is widely accepted: The \"giant impact hypothesis\" proposes that the Moon originated after a body the size of Mars (sometimes named Theia) struck the proto-Earth a glancing blow.\n\nThe collision released about 100 million times more energy than the more recent Chicxulub impact that is believed to have caused the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. It was enough to vaporize some of the Earth's outer layers and melt both bodies. A portion of the mantle material was ejected into orbit around the Earth. The giant impact hypothesis predicts that the Moon was depleted of metallic material, explaining its abnormal composition. The ejecta in orbit around the Earth could have condensed into a single body within a couple of weeks. Under the influence of its own gravity, the ejected material became a more spherical body: the Moon.\n\nMantle convection, the process that drives plate tectonics, is a result of heat flow from the Earth's interior to the Earth's surface. It involves the creation of rigid tectonic plates at mid-oceanic ridges. These plates are destroyed by subduction into the mantle at subduction zones. During the early Archean (about 3.0 Ga) the mantle was much hotter than today, probably around , so convection in the mantle was faster. Although a process similar to present-day plate tectonics did occur, this would have gone faster too. It is likely that during the Hadean and Archean, subduction zones were more common, and therefore tectonic plates were smaller.\n\nThe initial crust, formed when the Earth's surface first solidified, totally disappeared from a combination of this fast Hadean plate tectonics and the intense impacts of the Late Heavy Bombardment. However, it is thought that it was basaltic in composition, like today's oceanic crust, because little crustal differentiation had yet taken place. The first larger pieces of continental crust, which is a product of differentiation of lighter elements during partial melting in the lower crust, appeared at the end of the Hadean, about 4.0 Ga. What is left of these first small continents are called cratons. These pieces of late Hadean and early Archean crust form the cores around which today's continents grew.\n\nThe oldest rocks on Earth are found in the North American craton of Canada. They are tonalites from about 4.0 Ga. They show traces of metamorphism by high temperature, but also sedimentary grains that have been rounded by erosion during transport by water, showing that rivers and seas existed then. Cratons consist primarily of two alternating types of terranes. The first are so-called greenstone belts, consisting of low-grade metamorphosed sedimentary rocks. These \"greenstones\" are similar to the sediments today found in oceanic trenches, above subduction zones. For this reason, greenstones are sometimes seen as evidence for subduction during the Archean. The second type is a complex of felsic magmatic rocks. These rocks are mostly tonalite, trondhjemite or granodiorite, types of rock similar in composition to granite (hence such terranes are called TTG-terranes). TTG-complexes are seen as the relicts of the first continental crust, formed by partial melting in basalt.\n\nEarth is often described as having had three atmospheres. The first atmosphere, captured from the solar nebula, was composed of light (atmophile) elements from the solar nebula, mostly hydrogen and helium. A combination of the solar wind and Earth's heat would have driven off this atmosphere, as a result of which the atmosphere is now depleted of these elements compared to cosmic abundances. After the impact which created the Moon, the molten Earth released volatile gases; and later more gases were released by volcanoes, completing a second atmosphere rich in greenhouse gases but poor in oxygen. Finally, the third atmosphere, rich in oxygen, emerged when bacteria began to produce oxygen about 2.8 Ga.\n\nIn early models for the formation of the atmosphere and ocean, the second atmosphere was formed by outgassing of volatiles from the Earth's interior. Now it is considered likely that many of the volatiles were delivered during accretion by a process known as \"impact degassing\" in which incoming bodies vaporize on impact. The ocean and atmosphere would, therefore, have started to form even as the Earth formed. The new atmosphere probably contained water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and smaller amounts of other gases.\n\nPlanetesimals at a distance of 1 astronomical unit (AU), the distance of the Earth from the Sun, probably did not contribute any water to the Earth because the solar nebula was too hot for ice to form and the hydration of rocks by water vapor would have taken too long. The water must have been supplied by meteorites from the outer asteroid belt and some large planetary embryos from beyond 2.5 AU. Comets may also have contributed. Though most comets are today in orbits farther away from the Sun than Neptune, computer simulations show that they were originally far more common in the inner parts of the Solar System.\n\nAs the Earth cooled, clouds formed. Rain created the oceans. Recent evidence suggests the oceans may have begun forming as early as 4.4 Ga. By the start of the Archean eon, they already covered much of the Earth. This early formation has been difficult to explain because of a problem known as the faint young Sun paradox. Stars are known to get brighter as they age, and at the time of its formation the Sun would have been emitting only 70% of its current power. Thus, the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years. Many models indicate that the Earth would have been covered in ice. A likely solution is that there was enough carbon dioxide and methane to produce a greenhouse effect. The carbon dioxide would have been produced by volcanoes and the methane by early microbes. Another greenhouse gas, ammonia, would have been ejected by volcanos but quickly destroyed by ultraviolet radiation.\n\nOne of the reasons for interest in the early atmosphere and ocean is that they form the conditions under which life first arose. There are many models, but little consensus, on how life emerged from non-living chemicals; chemical systems created in the laboratory fall well short of the minimum complexity for a living organism.\n\nThe first step in the emergence of life may have been chemical reactions that produced many of the simpler organic compounds, including nucleobases and amino acids, that are the building blocks of life. An experiment in 1953 by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey showed that such molecules could form in an atmosphere of water, methane, ammonia and hydrogen with the aid of sparks to mimic the effect of lightning. Although atmospheric composition was probably different from that used by Miller and Urey, later experiments with more realistic compositions also managed to synthesize organic molecules. Computer simulations show that extraterrestrial organic molecules could have formed in the protoplanetary disk before the formation of the Earth.\n\nAdditional complexity could have been reached from at least three possible starting points: self-replication, an organism's ability to produce offspring that are similar to itself; metabolism, its ability to feed and repair itself; and external cell membranes, which allow food to enter and waste products to leave, but exclude unwanted substances.\n\nEven the simplest members of the three modern domains of life use DNA to record their \"recipes\" and a complex array of RNA and protein molecules to \"read\" these instructions and use them for growth, maintenance, and self-replication.\n\nThe discovery that a kind of RNA molecule called a ribozyme can catalyze both its own replication and the construction of proteins led to the hypothesis that earlier life-forms were based entirely on RNA. They could have formed an RNA world in which there were individuals but no species, as mutations and horizontal gene transfers would have meant that the offspring in each generation were quite likely to have different genomes from those that their parents started with. RNA would later have been replaced by DNA, which is more stable and therefore can build longer genomes, expanding the range of capabilities a single organism can have. Ribozymes remain as the main components of ribosomes, the \"protein factories\" of modern cells.\n\nAlthough short, self-replicating RNA molecules have been artificially produced in laboratories, doubts have been raised about whether natural non-biological synthesis of RNA is possible. The earliest ribozymes may have been formed of simpler nucleic acids such as PNA, TNA or GNA, which would have been replaced later by RNA. Other pre-RNA replicators have been posited, including crystals and even quantum systems.\n\nIn 2003 it was proposed that porous metal sulfide precipitates would assist RNA synthesis at about and at ocean-bottom pressures near hydrothermal vents. In this hypothesis, the proto-cells would be confined in the pores of the metal substrate until the later development of lipid membranes.\n\nAnother long-standing hypothesis is that the first life was composed of protein molecules. Amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, are easily synthesized in plausible prebiotic conditions, as are small peptides (polymers of amino acids) that make good catalysts. A series of experiments starting in 1997 showed that amino acids and peptides could form in the presence of carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide with iron sulfide and nickel sulfide as catalysts. Most of the steps in their assembly required temperatures of about and moderate pressures, although one stage required and a pressure equivalent to that found under of rock. Hence, self-sustaining synthesis of proteins could have occurred near hydrothermal vents.\n\nA difficulty with the metabolism-first scenario is finding a way for organisms to evolve. Without the ability to replicate as individuals, aggregates of molecules would have \"compositional genomes\" (counts of molecular species in the aggregate) as the target of natural selection. However, a recent model shows that such a system is unable to evolve in response to natural selection.\n\nIt has been suggested that double-walled \"bubbles\" of lipids like those that form the external membranes of cells may have been an essential first step. Experiments that simulated the conditions of the early Earth have reported the formation of lipids, and these can spontaneously form liposomes, double-walled \"bubbles\", and then reproduce themselves. Although they are not intrinsically information-carriers as nucleic acids are, they would be subject to natural selection for longevity and reproduction. Nucleic acids such as RNA might then have formed more easily within the liposomes than they would have outside.\n\nSome clays, notably montmorillonite, have properties that make them plausible accelerators for the emergence of an RNA world: they grow by self-replication of their crystalline pattern, are subject to an analog of natural selection (as the clay \"species\" that grows fastest in a particular environment rapidly becomes dominant), and can catalyze the formation of RNA molecules. Although this idea has not become the scientific consensus, it still has active supporters.\n\nResearch in 2003 reported that montmorillonite could also accelerate the conversion of fatty acids into \"bubbles\", and that the bubbles could encapsulate RNA attached to the clay. Bubbles can then grow by absorbing additional lipids and dividing. The formation of the earliest cells may have been aided by similar processes.\n\nA similar hypothesis presents self-replicating iron-rich clays as the progenitors of nucleotides, lipids and amino acids.\n\nIt is believed that of this multiplicity of protocells, only one line survived. Current phylogenetic evidence suggests that the last universal ancestor (LUA) lived during the early Archean eon, perhaps 3.5 Ga or earlier. This LUA cell is the ancestor of all life on Earth today. It was probably a prokaryote, possessing a cell membrane and probably ribosomes, but lacking a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. Like modern cells, it used DNA as its genetic code, RNA for information transfer and protein synthesis, and enzymes to catalyze reactions. Some scientists believe that instead of a single organism being the last universal common ancestor, there were populations of organisms exchanging genes by lateral gene transfer.\n\nThe Proterozoic eon lasted from 2.5 Ga to 542 Ma (million years) ago. In this time span, cratons grew into continents with modern sizes. The change to an oxygen-rich atmosphere was a crucial development. Life developed from prokaryotes into eukaryotes and multicellular forms. The Proterozoic saw a couple of severe ice ages called snowball Earths. After the last Snowball Earth about 600 Ma, the evolution of life on Earth accelerated. About 580 Ma, the Ediacaran biota formed the prelude for the Cambrian Explosion.\n\nThe earliest cells absorbed energy and food from the surrounding environment. They used fermentation, the breakdown of more complex compounds into less complex compounds with less energy, and used the energy so liberated to grow and reproduce. Fermentation can only occur in an \"anaerobic\" (oxygen-free) environment. The evolution of photosynthesis made it possible for cells to derive energy from the Sun.\n\nMost of the life that covers the surface of the Earth depends directly or indirectly on photosynthesis. The most common form, oxygenic photosynthesis, turns carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into food. It captures the energy of sunlight in energy-rich molecules such as ATP, which then provide the energy to make sugars. To supply the electrons in the circuit, hydrogen is stripped from water, leaving oxygen as a waste product. Some organisms, including purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria, use an anoxygenic form of photosynthesis that uses alternatives to hydrogen stripped from water as electron donors; examples are hydrogen sulfide, sulfur and iron. Such extremophile organisms are restricted to otherwise inhospitable environments such as hot springs and hydrothermal vents.\n\nThe simpler anoxygenic form arose about 3.8 Ga, not long after the appearance of life. The timing of oxygenic photosynthesis is more controversial; it had certainly appeared by about 2.4 Ga, but some researchers put it back as far as 3.2 Ga. The latter \"probably increased global productivity by at least two or three orders of magnitude\". Among the oldest remnants of oxygen-producing lifeforms are fossil stromatolites.\n\nAt first, the released oxygen was bound up with limestone, iron, and other minerals. The oxidized iron appears as red layers in geological strata called banded iron formations that formed in abundance during the Siderian period (between 2500 Ma and 2300 Ma). When most of the exposed readily reacting minerals were oxidized, oxygen finally began to accumulate in the atmosphere. Though each cell only produced a minute amount of oxygen, the combined metabolism of many cells over a vast time transformed Earth's atmosphere to its current state. This was Earth's third atmosphere.\n\nSome oxygen was stimulated by solar ultraviolet radiation to form ozone, which collected in a layer near the upper part of the atmosphere. The ozone layer absorbed, and still absorbs, a significant amount of the ultraviolet radiation that once had passed through the atmosphere. It allowed cells to colonize the surface of the ocean and eventually the land: without the ozone layer, ultraviolet radiation bombarding land and sea would have caused unsustainable levels of mutation in exposed cells.\n\nPhotosynthesis had another major impact. Oxygen was toxic; much life on Earth probably died out as its levels rose in what is known as the \"oxygen catastrophe\". Resistant forms survived and thrived, and some developed the ability to use oxygen to increase their metabolism and obtain more energy from the same food.\n\nThe natural evolution of the Sun made it progressively more luminous during the Archean and Proterozoic eons; the Sun's luminosity increases 6% every billion years. As a result, the Earth began to receive more heat from the Sun in the Proterozoic eon. However, the Earth did not get warmer. Instead, the geological record suggests it cooled dramatically during the early Proterozoic. Glacial deposits found in South Africa date back to 2.2 Ga, at which time, based on paleomagnetic evidence, they must have been located near the equator. Thus, this glaciation, known as the Huronian glaciation, may have been global. Some scientists suggest this was so severe that the Earth was frozen over from the poles to the equator, a hypothesis called Snowball Earth.\n\nThe Huronian ice age might have been caused by the increased oxygen concentration in the atmosphere, which caused the decrease of methane (CH) in the atmosphere. Methane is a strong greenhouse gas, but with oxygen it reacts to form CO, a less effective greenhouse gas. When free oxygen became available in the atmosphere, the concentration of methane could have decreased dramatically, enough to counter the effect of the increasing heat flow from the Sun.\n\nHowever, the term Snowball Earth is more commonly used to describe later extreme ice ages during the Cryogenian period. There were four periods, each lasting about 10 million years, between 750 and 580 million years ago, when the earth is thought to have been covered with ice apart from the highest mountains, and average temperatures were about . The snowball may have been partly due to the location of the supercontintent Rodinia straddling the Equator. Carbon dioxide combines with rain to weather rocks to form carbonic acid, which is then washed out to sea, thus extracting the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. When the continents are near the poles, the advance of ice covers the rocks, slowing the reduction in carbon dioxide, but in the Cryogenian the weathering of Rodinia was able to continue unchecked until the ice advanced to the tropics. The process may have finally been reversed by the emission of carbon dioxide from volcanoes or the destabilization of methane gas hydrates. According to the alternative Slushball Earth theory, even at the height of the ice ages there was still open water at the Equator.\n\nModern taxonomy classifies life into three domains. The time of their origin is uncertain. The Bacteria domain probably first split off from the other forms of life (sometimes called Neomura), but this supposition is controversial. Soon after this, by 2 Ga, the Neomura split into the Archaea and the Eukarya. Eukaryotic cells (Eukarya) are larger and more complex than prokaryotic cells (Bacteria and Archaea), and the origin of that complexity is only now becoming known. The earliest fossils possessing features typical of fungi date to the Paleoproterozoic era, some 2.4 ago; these multicellular benthic organisms had filamentous structures capable of anastomosis.\nAround this time, the first proto-mitochondrion was formed. A bacterial cell related to today's \"Rickettsia\", which had evolved to metabolize oxygen, entered a larger prokaryotic cell, which lacked that capability. Perhaps the large cell attempted to digest the smaller one but failed (possibly due to the evolution of prey defenses). The smaller cell may have tried to parasitize the larger one. In any case, the smaller cell survived inside the larger cell. Using oxygen, it metabolized the larger cell's waste products and derived more energy. Part of this excess energy was returned to the host. The smaller cell replicated inside the larger one. Soon, a stable symbiosis developed between the large cell and the smaller cells inside it. Over time, the host cell acquired some genes from the smaller cells, and the two kinds became dependent on each other: the larger cell could not survive without the energy produced by the smaller ones, and these, in turn, could not survive without the raw materials provided by the larger cell. The whole cell is now considered a single organism, and the smaller cells are classified as organelles called mitochondria.\n\nA similar event occurred with photosynthetic cyanobacteria entering large heterotrophic cells and becoming chloroplasts. Probably as a result of these changes, a line of cells capable of photosynthesis split off from the other eukaryotes more than 1 billion years ago. There were probably several such inclusion events. Besides the well-established endosymbiotic theory of the cellular origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts, there are theories that cells led to peroxisomes, spirochetes led to cilia and flagella, and that perhaps a DNA virus led to the cell nucleus, though none of them are widely accepted.\n\nArchaeans, bacteria, and eukaryotes continued to diversify and to become more complex and better adapted to their environments. Each domain repeatedly split into multiple lineages, although little is known about the history of the archaea and bacteria. Around 1.1 Ga, the supercontinent Rodinia was assembling. The plant, animal, and fungi lines had split, though they still existed as solitary cells. Some of these lived in colonies, and gradually a division of labor began to take place; for instance, cells on the periphery might have started to assume different roles from those in the interior. Although the division between a colony with specialized cells and a multicellular organism is not always clear, around 1 billion years ago, the first multicellular plants emerged, probably green algae. Possibly by around 900 Ma true multicellularity had also evolved in animals.\n\nAt first, it probably resembled today's sponges, which have totipotent cells that allow a disrupted organism to reassemble itself. As the division of labor was completed in all lines of multicellular organisms, cells became more specialized and more dependent on each other; isolated cells would die.\n\nReconstructions of tectonic plate movement in the past 250 million years (the Cenozoic and Mesozoic eras) can be made reliably using fitting of continental margins, ocean floor magnetic anomalies and paleomagnetic poles. No ocean crust dates back further than that, so earlier reconstructions are more difficult. Paleomagnetic poles are supplemented by geologic evidence such as orogenic belts, which mark the edges of ancient plates, and past distributions of flora and fauna. The further back in time, the scarcer and harder to interpret the data get and the more uncertain the reconstructions.\n\nThroughout the history of the Earth, there have been times when continents collided and formed a supercontinent, which later broke up into new continents. About 1000 to 830 Ma, most continental mass was united in the supercontinent Rodinia. Rodinia may have been preceded by Early-Middle Proterozoic continents called Nuna and Columbia.\n\nAfter the break-up of Rodinia about 800 Ma, the continents may have formed another short-lived supercontinent around 550 Ma. The hypothetical supercontinent is sometimes referred to as Pannotia or Vendia. The evidence for it is a phase of continental collision known as the Pan-African orogeny, which joined the continental masses of current-day Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia. The existence of Pannotia depends on the timing of the rifting between Gondwana (which included most of the landmass now in the Southern Hemisphere, as well as the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent) and Laurentia (roughly equivalent to current-day North America). It is at least certain that by the end of the Proterozoic eon, most of the continental mass lay united in a position around the south pole.\n\nThe end of the Proterozoic saw at least two Snowball Earths, so severe that the surface of the oceans may have been completely frozen. This happened about 716.5 and 635 Ma, in the Cryogenian period. The intensity and mechanism of both glaciations are still under investigation and harder to explain than the early Proterozoic Snowball Earth.\nMost paleoclimatologists think the cold episodes were linked to the formation of the supercontinent Rodinia. Because Rodinia was centered on the equator, rates of chemical weathering increased and carbon dioxide (CO) was taken from the atmosphere. Because CO is an important greenhouse gas, climates cooled globally.\nIn the same way, during the Snowball Earths most of the continental surface was covered with permafrost, which decreased chemical weathering again, leading to the end of the glaciations. An alternative hypothesis is that enough carbon dioxide escaped through volcanic outgassing that the resulting greenhouse effect raised global temperatures. Increased volcanic activity resulted from the break-up of Rodinia at about the same time.\n\nThe Cryogenian period was followed by the Ediacaran period, which was characterized by a rapid development of new multicellular lifeforms. Whether there is a connection between the end of the severe ice ages and the increase in diversity of life is not clear, but it does not seem coincidental. The new forms of life, called Ediacara biota, were larger and more diverse than ever. Though the taxonomy of most Ediacaran life forms is unclear, some were ancestors of groups of modern life. Important developments were the origin of muscular and neural cells. None of the Ediacaran fossils had hard body parts like skeletons. These first appear after the boundary between the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic eons or Ediacaran and Cambrian periods.\n\nThe Phanerozoic is the current eon on Earth, which started approximately 542 million years ago. It consists of three eras: The Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic, and is the time when multi-cellular life greatly diversified into almost all the organisms known today.\n\nThe Paleozoic (\"old life\") era was the first and longest era of the Phanerozoic eon, lasting from 542 to 251 Ma. During the Paleozoic, many modern groups of life came into existence. Life colonized the land, first plants, then animals. Two major extinctions occurred. The continents formed at the break-up of Pannotia and Rodinia at the end of the Proterozoic slowly moved together again, forming the supercontinent Pangaea in the late Paleozoic.\n\nThe Mesozoic (\"middle life\") era lasted from 251 Ma to  Ma. It is subdivided into the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. The era began with the Permian–Triassic extinction event, the most severe extinction event in the fossil record; 95% of the species on Earth died out. It ended with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs..\n\nThe Cenozoic (\"new life\") era began at  Ma, and is subdivided into the Paleogene, Neogene, and Quaternary periods. These three periods are further split into seven sub-divisions, with the Paleogene composed of The Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligocene, the Neogene divided into the Miocene, Pliocene, and the Quaternary composed of the Pleistocene, and Holocene. Mammals, birds, amphibians, crocodilians, turtles, and lepidosaurs survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed off the non-avian dinosaurs and many other forms of life, and this is the era during which they diversified into their modern forms.\n\nAt the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.\n\nEarly Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.\n\nThe continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.\n\nBy 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.\n\nThe rate of the evolution of life as recorded by fossils accelerated in the Cambrian period (542–488 Ma). The sudden emergence of many new species, phyla, and forms in this period is called the Cambrian Explosion. The biological fomenting in the Cambrian Explosion was unpreceded before and since that time. Whereas the Ediacaran life forms appear yet primitive and not easy to put in any modern group, at the end of the Cambrian most modern phyla were already present. The development of hard body parts such as shells, skeletons or exoskeletons in animals like molluscs, echinoderms, crinoids and arthropods (a well-known group of arthropods from the lower Paleozoic are the trilobites) made the preservation and fossilization of such life forms easier than those of their Proterozoic ancestors. For this reason, much more is known about life in and after the Cambrian than about that of older periods. Some of these Cambrian groups appear complex but are seemingly quite different from modern life; examples are \"Anomalocaris\" and \"Haikouichthys\". More recently, however, these seem to have found a place in modern classification. \n\nDuring the Cambrian, the first vertebrate animals, among them the first fishes, had appeared. A creature that could have been the ancestor of the fishes, or was probably closely related to it, was \"Pikaia\". It had a primitive notochord, a structure that could have developed into a vertebral column later. The first fishes with jaws (Gnathostomata) appeared during the next geological period, the Ordovician. The colonisation of new niches resulted in massive body sizes. In this way, fishes with increasing sizes evolved during the early Paleozoic, such as the titanic placoderm \"Dunkleosteus\", which could grow long.\n\nThe diversity of life forms did not increase greatly because of a series of mass extinctions that define widespread biostratigraphic units called \"biomeres\". After each extinction pulse, the continental shelf regions were repopulated by similar life forms that may have been evolving slowly elsewhere. By the late Cambrian, the trilobites had reached their greatest diversity and dominated nearly all fossil assemblages.\n\nOxygen accumulation from photosynthesis resulted in the formation of an ozone layer that absorbed much of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation, meaning unicellular organisms that reached land were less likely to die, and prokaryotes began to multiply and become better adapted to survival out of the water. Prokaryote lineages had probably colonized the land as early as 2.6 Ga even before the origin of the eukaryotes. For a long time, the land remained barren of multicellular organisms. The supercontinent Pannotia formed around 600 Ma and then broke apart a short 50 million years later. Fish, the earliest vertebrates, evolved in the oceans around 530 Ma. A major extinction event occurred near the end of the Cambrian period, which ended 488 Ma.\n\nSeveral hundred million years ago, plants (probably resembling algae) and fungi started growing at the edges of the water, and then out of it. The oldest fossils of land fungi and plants date to 480–460 Ma, though molecular evidence suggests the fungi may have colonized the land as early as 1000 Ma and the plants 700 Ma. Initially remaining close to the water's edge, mutations and variations resulted in further colonization of this new environment. The timing of the first animals to leave the oceans is not precisely known: the oldest clear evidence is of arthropods on land around 450 Ma, perhaps thriving and becoming better adapted due to the vast food source provided by the terrestrial plants. There is also unconfirmed evidence that arthropods may have appeared on land as early as 530 Ma.\n\nAt the end of the Ordovician period, 443 Ma, additional extinction events occurred, perhaps due to a concurrent ice age. Around 380 to 375 Ma, the first tetrapods evolved from fish. Fins evolved to become limbs that the first tetrapods used to lift their heads out of the water to breathe air. This would let them live in oxygen-poor water, or pursue small prey in shallow water. They may have later ventured on land for brief periods. Eventually, some of them became so well adapted to terrestrial life that they spent their adult lives on land, although they hatched in the water and returned to lay their eggs. This was the origin of the amphibians. About 365 Ma, another period of extinction occurred, perhaps as a result of global cooling. Plants evolved seeds, which dramatically accelerated their spread on land, around this time (by approximately 360 Ma).\n\nAbout 20 million years later (340 Ma), the amniotic egg evolved, which could be laid on land, giving a survival advantage to tetrapod embryos. This resulted in the divergence of amniotes from amphibians. Another 30 million years (310 Ma) saw the divergence of the synapsids (including mammals) from the sauropsids (including birds and reptiles). Other groups of organisms continued to evolve, and lines diverged—in fish, insects, bacteria, and so on—but less is known of the details.\nAfter yet another, the most severe extinction of the period (251~250 Ma), around 230 Ma, dinosaurs split off from their reptilian ancestors. The Triassic–Jurassic extinction event at 200 Ma spared many of the dinosaurs, and they soon became dominant among the vertebrates. Though some mammalian lines began to separate during this period, existing mammals were probably small animals resembling shrews.\n\nThe boundary between avian and non-avian dinosaurs is not clear, but \"Archaeopteryx\", traditionally considered one of the first birds, lived around 150 Ma.\n\nThe earliest evidence for the angiosperms evolving flowers is during the Cretaceous period, some 20 million years later (132 Ma).\n\nThe first of five great mass extinctions was the Ordovician-Silurian extinction. Its possible cause was the intense glaciation of Gondwana, which eventually led to a snowball earth. 60% of marine invertebrates became extinct and 25% of all families.\n\nThe second mass extinction was the Late Devonian extinction, probably caused by the evolution of trees, which could have led to the depletion of greenhouse gases (like CO2) or the eutrophication of water. 70% of all species became extinct.\n\nThe third mass extinction was the Permian-Triassic, or the Great Dying, event was possibly caused by some combination of the Siberian Traps volcanic event, an asteroid impact, methane hydrate gasification, sea level fluctuations, and a major anoxic event. Either the proposed Wilkes Land crater in Antarctica or Bedout structure off the northwest coast of Australia may indicate an impact connection with the Permian-Triassic extinction. But it remains uncertain whether either these or other proposed Permian-Triassic boundary craters are either real impact craters or even contemporaneous with the Permian-Triassic extinction event. This was by far the deadliest extinction ever, with about 57% of all families and 83% of all genera killed.\n\nThe fourth mass extinction was the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event in which almost all synapsids and archosaurs became extinct, probably due to new competition from dinosaurs.\n\nThe fifth and most recent mass extinction was the K-T extinction. In 66 Ma, a asteroid struck Earth just off the Yucatán Peninsula—somewhere in the south western tip of then Laurasia—where the Chicxulub crater is today. This ejected vast quantities of particulate matter and vapor into the air that occluded sunlight, inhibiting photosynthesis. 75% of all life, including the non-avian dinosaurs, became extinct, marking the end of the Cretaceous period and Mesozoic era.\n\nThe first true mammals evolved in the shadows of dinosaurs and other large archosaurs that filled the world by the late Triassic. The first mammals were very small, and were probably nocturnal to escape predation. Mammal diversification truly began only after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. By the early Paleocene the earth recovered from the extinction, and mammalian diversity increased. Creatures like \"Ambulocetus\" took to the oceans to eventually evolve into whales, whereas some creatures, like primates, took to the trees. This all changed during the mid to late Eocene when the circum-Antarctic current formed between Antarctica and Australia which disrupted weather patterns on a global scale. Grassless savannas began to predominate much of the landscape, and mammals such as \"Andrewsarchus\" rose up to become the largest known terrestrial predatory mammal ever, and early whales like \"Basilosaurus\" took control of the seas. \n\nThe evolution of grass brought a remarkable change to the Earth's landscape, and the new open spaces created pushed mammals to get bigger and bigger. Grass started to expand in the Miocene, and the Miocene is where many modern- day mammals first appeared. Giant ungulates like \"Paraceratherium\" and \"Deinotherium\" evolved to rule the grasslands. The evolution of grass also brought primates down from the trees, and started human evolution. The first big cats evolved during this time as well. The Tethys Sea was closed off by the collision of Africa and Europe.\n\nThe formation of Panama was perhaps the most important geological event to occur in the last 60 million years. Atlantic and Pacific currents were closed off from each other, which caused the formation of the Gulf Stream, which made Europe warmer. The land bridge allowed the isolated creatures of South America to migrate over to North America, and vice versa. Various species migrated south, leading to the presence in South America of llamas, the spectacled bear, kinkajous and jaguars.\n\nThree million years ago saw the start of the Pleistocene epoch, which featured dramatic climactic changes due to the ice ages. The ice ages led to the evolution of modern man in Saharan Africa and expansion. The mega-fauna that dominated fed on grasslands that, by now, had taken over much of the subtropical world. The large amounts of water held in the ice allowed for various bodies of water to shrink and sometimes disappear such as the North Sea and the Bering Strait. It is believed by many that a huge migration took place along Beringia which is why, today, there are camels (which evolved and became extinct in North America), horses (which evolved and became extinct in North America), and Native Americans. The ending of the last ice age coincided with the expansion of man, along with a massive die out of ice age mega-fauna. This extinction is nicknamed \"the Sixth Extinction\".\n\nA small African ape living around 6 Ma was the last animal whose descendants would include both modern humans and their closest relatives, the chimpanzees. Only two branches of its family tree have surviving descendants. Very soon after the split, for reasons that are still unclear, apes in one branch developed the ability to walk upright. Brain size increased rapidly, and by 2 Ma, the first animals classified in the genus \"Homo\" had appeared. Of course, the line between different species or even genera is somewhat arbitrary as organisms continuously change over generations. Around the same time, the other branch split into the ancestors of the common chimpanzee and the ancestors of the bonobo as evolution continued simultaneously in all life forms.\n\nThe ability to control fire probably began in \"Homo erectus\" (or \"Homo ergaster\"), probably at least 790,000 years ago but perhaps as early as 1.5 Ma. The use and discovery of controlled fire may even predate \"Homo erectus\". Fire was possibly used by the early Lower Paleolithic (Oldowan) hominid \"Homo habilis\" or strong australopithecines such as \"Paranthropus.\"\n\nIt is more difficult to establish the origin of language; it is unclear whether \"Homo erectus\" could speak or if that capability had not begun until \"Homo sapiens\". As brain size increased, babies were born earlier, before their heads grew too large to pass through the pelvis. As a result, they exhibited more plasticity, and thus possessed an increased capacity to learn and required a longer period of dependence. Social skills became more complex, language became more sophisticated, and tools became more elaborate. This contributed to further cooperation and intellectual development. Modern humans (\"Homo sapiens\") are believed to have originated around 200,000 years ago or earlier in Africa; the oldest fossils date back to around 160,000 years ago.\n\nThe first humans to show signs of spirituality are the Neanderthals (usually classified as a separate species with no surviving descendants); they buried their dead, often with no sign of food or tools. However, evidence of more sophisticated beliefs, such as the early Cro-Magnon cave paintings (probably with magical or religious significance) did not appear until 32,000 years ago. Cro-Magnons also left behind stone figurines such as Venus of Willendorf, probably also signifying religious belief. By 11,000 years ago, \"Homo sapiens\" had reached the southern tip of South America, the last of the uninhabited continents (except for Antarctica, which remained undiscovered until 1820 AD). Tool use and communication continued to improve, and interpersonal relationships became more intricate.\n\nThroughout more than 90% of its history, \"Homo sapiens\" lived in small bands as nomadic hunter-gatherers. As language became more complex, the ability to remember and communicate information resulted, according to a theory proposed by Richard Dawkins, in a new replicator: the meme. Ideas could be exchanged quickly and passed down the generations. Cultural evolution quickly outpaced biological evolution, and history proper began. Between 8500 and 7000 BC, humans in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals: agriculture. This spread to neighboring regions, and developed independently elsewhere, until most \"Homo sapiens\" lived sedentary lives in permanent settlements as farmers. Not all societies abandoned nomadism, especially those in isolated areas of the globe poor in domesticable plant species, such as Australia. However, among those civilizations that did adopt agriculture, the relative stability and increased productivity provided by farming allowed the population to expand.\n\nAgriculture had a major impact; humans began to affect the environment as never before. Surplus food allowed a priestly or governing class to arise, followed by increasing division of labor. This led to Earth's first civilization at Sumer in the Middle East, between 4000 and 3000 BC. Additional civilizations quickly arose in ancient Egypt, at the Indus River valley and in China. The invention of writing enabled complex societies to arise: record-keeping and libraries served as a storehouse of knowledge and increased the cultural transmission of information. Humans no longer had to spend all their time working for survival, enabling the first specialized occupations (e.g. craftsmen, merchants, priests, etc...). Curiosity and education drove the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, and various disciplines, including science (in a primitive form), arose. This in turn led to the emergence of increasingly larger and more complex civilizations, such as the first empires, which at times traded with one another, or fought for territory and resources.\n\nBy around 500 BC, there were advanced civilizations in the Middle East, Iran, India, China, and Greece, at times expanding, at times entering into decline. In 221 BC, China became a single polity that would grow to spread its culture throughout East Asia, and it has remained the most populous nation in the world. The fundamentals of Western civilization were largely shaped in Ancient Greece, with the world's first democratic government and major advances in philosophy, science, and mathematics, and in Ancient Rome in law, government, and engineering. The Roman Empire was Christianized by Emperor Constantine in the early 4th century and declined by the end of the 5th. Beginning with the 7th century, Christianization of Europe began. In 610, Islam was founded and quickly became the dominant religion in Western Asia. The House of Wisdom was established in Abbasid-era Baghdad, Iraq. It is considered to have been a major intellectual center during the Islamic Golden Age, where Muslim scholars in Baghdad and Cairo flourished from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries until the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258 AD. In 1054 AD the Great Schism between the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church led to the prominent cultural differences between Western and Eastern Europe.\n\nIn the 14th century, the Renaissance began in Italy with advances in religion, art, and science. At that time the Christian Church as a political entity lost much of its power. In 1492, Christopher Columbus reached the Americas, initiating great changes to the new world. European civilization began to change beginning in 1500, leading to the scientific and industrial revolutions. That continent began to exert political and cultural dominance over human societies around the world, a time known as the Colonial era (also see Age of Discovery). In the 18th century a cultural movement known as the Age of Enlightenment further shaped the mentality of Europe and contributed to its secularization. From 1914 to 1918 and 1939 to 1945, nations around the world were embroiled in world wars. Established following World War I, the League of Nations was a first step in establishing international institutions to settle disputes peacefully. After failing to prevent World War II, mankind's bloodiest conflict, it was replaced by the United Nations. After the war, many new states were formed, declaring or being granted independence in a period of decolonization. The United States and Soviet Union became the world's dominant superpowers for a time, and they held an often-violent rivalry known as the Cold War until the dissolution of the latter. In 1992, several European nations joined in the European Union. As transportation and communication improved, the economies and political affairs of nations around the world have become increasingly intertwined. This globalization has often produced both conflict and cooperation.\n\nChange has continued at a rapid pace from the mid-1940s to today. Technological developments include nuclear weapons, computers, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology. Economic globalization, spurred by advances in communication and transportation technology, has influenced everyday life in many parts of the world. Cultural and institutional forms such as democracy, capitalism, and environmentalism have increased influence. Major concerns and problems such as disease, war, poverty, violent radicalism, and recently, human-caused climate change have risen as the world population increases.\n\nIn 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite into orbit and, soon afterward, Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space. Neil Armstrong, an American, was the first to set foot on another astronomical object, the Moon. Unmanned probes have been sent to all the known planets in the Solar System, with some (such as the two Voyager spacecrafts) having left the Solar System. Five space agencies, representing over fifteen countries, have worked together to build the International Space Station. Aboard it, there has been a continuous human presence in space since 2000. The World Wide Web became a part of everyday life in the 1990s, and since then has become an indispensable source of information in the developed world.\n\n\n"}

Thrasyllus was an astrologer and a personal friend of the Roman emperor Tiberius, as mentioned in the \"Annals\" by Tacitus and \"The Twelve Caesars\" by Suetonius.\n\nThrasyllus was an Egyptian of Greek descent from unknown origins, as his family and ancestors were contemporaries that lived under the rule of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. He originally was either from Mendes or Alexandria. Thrasyllus is often mentioned in various secondary sources as coming from Alexandria (as mentioned in the \"Oxford Classical Dictionary\") as no primary source confirms his origins.\n\nThrasyllus encountered Tiberius during the period of Tiberius' voluntary exile on the Greek island of Rhodes, some time between 1 BC and 4 AD. Thrasyllus became the intimate and celebrated servant of Tiberius, and Tiberius developed an interest in Stoicism and Astrology from Thrasyllus.\n\nHe predicted that Tiberius would be recalled to Rome and officially named the successor to Augustus. When Tiberius returned to Rome, Thrasyllus accompanied him and remained close to him. During the reign of the emperor Tiberius, Thrasyllus served as his skilled Court Astrologer both in Rome and, later, in Capri. As Tiberius held Thrasyllus in the highest honor, he rewarded him for his friendship by giving Roman citizenship to him and his family.\n\nThe daughter-in-law of Tiberius, his niece Livilla, reportedly consulted Thrasyllus during her affair with Sejanus, Tiberius' chief minister. Thrasyllus persuaded Tiberius to leave Rome for Capri while clandestinely supporting Sejanus. The grandson-in-law of Thrasyllus, Naevius Sutorius Macro, carried out orders that destroyed Sejanus, whether with Thrasyllus’ knowledge is unknown. He remained on Capri with Tiberius, advising the Emperor on his relationship with the various claimants to his succession. Thrasyllus was an ally who favored Tiberius’ great-nephew Caligula, who was having an affair with his granddaughter, Ennia Thrasylla.\n\nIn 36 AD, Thrasyllus is said to have made Tiberius believe he would survive another ten years. With this false prediction, Thrasyllus saved the lives of a number of Roman nobles who would be suspected in falsely plotting against Tiberius. Tiberius, believing in Thrasyllus, was confident that he would outlive any plotters, and so failed to act against them. Thrasyllus predeceased Tiberius, so did not live to see the realization of his prediction that Caligula would succeed Tiberius.\n\nThrasyllus by profession was a grammarian (i.e. literary scholar). He edited the written works of Plato and Democritus. According to the \"Encyclopaedia Judaica\", he wrote that the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt took place in 1690 BC. The sections include, Dedumose I, Ipuwer Papyrus and Shiphrah.\n\nHe was the author of an astrological text titled \"Pinax\" or \"Table\", which is lost but has been summarized in later sources, such as: CCAG - Catalogue of the Codices of the Greek astrologers (8/3: 99-101) which borrows the astrological notions found in Nechepso/Petosiris (see article on Hellenistic astrology) and in Hermes Trismegistus, an early pseudepigraphical source of astrology. Pinax was known and cited by the later following astrological writers: Vettius Valens, Porphyry and Hephaistio.\n\nThrasyllus married a Princess from the Kingdom of Commagene, whose name was Aka, often known as Aka II of Commagene. Aka was a Commagenian Monarch of Armenian, Greek and Median descent. Chronically, Aka is one of the daughters born to the former Commagenian ruling monarchs Mithridates III of Commagene and his cousin-wife Iotapa, thus was a sister of Antiochus III of Commagene. Through her parents, Aka was a descendant of the ruling monarchs of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Aka is known from a preserved incomplete poem, that mentions Aka as the wife of Thrasyllus and mentions she was of royal origins. Thrasyllus married Aka at an unknown date in the late second half of the first century BC and the circumstances that led Thrasyllus to marry Aka are unknown.\n\nAka bore Thrasyllus two known children: \n\nThrasyllus is a character in the novel series, written by Robert Graves, \"I, Claudius\" and \"Claudius the God\". Thrasyllus' predictions are always correct, and his prophecies are equally far-reaching. Thrasyllus predicts Jesus of Nazareth's crucifixion and that his religion shall overtake the Roman Pagan Religion. Similarly towards the end of his life it is explained that his final prophecy was misinterpreted by Tiberius. Thrasyllus states that \"Tiberius Claudius will be emperor in 10 years,\" leading Tiberius to brashly criticize and mock Caligula, whereas his prophecy is correct as Claudius' name is \"Tiberius Claudius\".\n\nIn the TV miniseries adaptation of the novels, Thrasyllus was played by Kevin Stoney, who had previously played him in the 1968 ITV series \"The Caesars\".\n\nIn contrast, Thrasyllus and his descendants are presented as power-hungry charlatans in the novel series \"Romanike\".\n\n\n"}

It is a guandao, a type of traditional Chinese weapon.\n\nIt is also sometimes referred to as the Frost Fair Blade (冷豔鋸), from the idea that during a battle in the snow, the blade continuously had blood on it; the blood froze and made a layer of frost on the blade.\n\nIn the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", the blade is forged by a local blacksmith using steel sponsored by Zhang Shiping (張世平), a merchant sympathetic to Liu Bei's cause. When Guan Yu meets his end in 219, the blade is given to Pan Zhang by Sun Quan for his role in capturing Guan Yu. During the Battle of Yiling, Guan Yu's son Guan Xing kills Pan Zhang when the latter is stunned by a vision of Guan Yu's spirit. Guan Xing then takes back the Green Dragon Crescent Blade and later passes it down the generations from father to son in the Guan family.\n\nIt is highly questionable whether Guan Yu actually wielded the Green Dragon or whether it was merely part of the myths surrounding him. Valid historical texts from his time period made no mention of him or anyone wielding a similar weapon. Because the guandao was known not to be widely used until the Song Dynasty, there is some doubt as to whether the guandao existed during Guan Yu's time. The guandao may not have been very widely used because it was both difficult to wield and heavy (Guan Yu, reportedly, was able to wield it with agility with just one hand, while most people would have trouble using it effectively even with both hands). However, this may be due to the legend regarding the weight surrounding the blade, whereas in reality, it was much lighter.\n\nAccording to , the Green Dragon Crescent Blade was said to weigh 82 catties. During the Eastern Han Dynasty and Three Kingdoms periods, one catty was approximately 220 grams, so 82 catties would have been approximately 18 kilograms (~40 pounds). A weapon weighing about 100 pounds (~45 kilograms), purported to be the Green Dragon Crescent Blade, is on display at the Purple Cloud Temple in China today.\n\nLegend says that Guan Yu invented the guandao. He had it forged after he met Liu Bei and Zhang Fei but before he made the Oath of the Peach Garden.\n\nThe story of the blade was that there was a blacksmith forging the blade when suddenly a green dragon passed by. The dragon was cut up and the body became part of the pieces therefore making the dao a magical weapon.\n\n"}

He earned a degree in drama and worked in television before turning to a cartooning career. From 1971 he published a strip called \"Barefootz\", which appeared in a number of underground comix publications, including three issues under its own title. Cruse's contemporaries gave it little regard, deeming it too cute and gentle compared to the countercultural works alongside which it ran. In 1976, Cruse introduced a gay character into the strip, committing to the gay liberation movement.\n\nIn 1979 Denis Kitchen of Kitchen Sink Press invited Cruse to edit the comic-book anthology \"Gay Comix\"; the first issue appeared in 1980. From 1983 to 1989 Cruse produced \"Wendel\", an ongoing humorous comic strip for the LGBT magazine \"The Advocate\".\n\nPiranha Press, an imprint of DC Comics that published alternative comics, contracted with Cruse for a graphic novel. It gave him an advance against royalties to cover expenses for the two years projected to finish the book. Cruse ultimately took four years. When his finances became tight, he took time away from the book to raise funds by applying for grants and selling original art pages from the book before they were drawn. Piranha Press was discontinued in 1994, before Cruse finished \"Stuck Rubber Baby\". The novel was instead published by DC's Paradox Press imprint in 1995, in hardcover and in paperback in 1996 by HarperCollins In 2010, Vertigo published a new edition. Cruse's agents Denis Kitchen and John Lind successfully moved the book to First Second Books to be published in 2020 as the 25th Anniversary edition which will include unpublished material from Cruse's archives.\n\nPlaywright Tony Kushner wrote an introduction to the first edition. Cartoonist Alison Bechdel contributed an introduction to the 2010 reprint edition. Translations have been published in French, German, Italian, and Spanish.\n\nDecades after the book's events, the forty-something Toland Polk narrates his youth in the fictional town of Clayfield, in the American South in the 1950s and 1960s. After his parents die in a car accident, he finds he has no direction. He chooses to work for a gas station rather than go to college.\n\nPolk becomes involved with the black community and the Civil Rights Movement. At the same time, he courts a folk singer named Ginger in the hopes of \"curing\" his homosexuality. Together they have a child they give up for adoption. Polk finds the black community more accepting of his homosexuality than his own white community. The bombing of a black community center, the lynching of a gay friend, and other such events push him to social activism.\n\nThe dense black-and-white artwork is more restrained and less cartoony than that of Cruse's earlier work. Cruse abandons his trademark stippling for heavily crosshatching. He gives particular attention to buildings and other background details, and to rendering characters with individuality. Ben Bolling likens the rounded rendering of the figures to those in the paintings of American artist Paul Cadmus. The pages are dense with dialogue balloons.\n\nThe frame story, set off with rounded panel borders, takes place in the late 1980s or early 1990s, as the adult Toland narrates with his male partner by his side. The narration appears to occur over a substantial span of time, as the pair's clothing and background reflect seasonal changes from summer to winter.\n\nThe story is not autobiographical, but Cruse draws from his experiences growing up in Birmingham, Alabama. He also includes such historical events as the 1955 murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi and the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham in 1963.\n\nIn an interview with Comic Book Resources, Cruse said that he based the novel on his own experiences in the 1960s and his \"anger at the degree to which the ideals of the Civil Rights Era were being abandoned.\"\n\nIn another interview, Cruse stated, \"My goal was to create the kind of novel that is too full of incident for someone to simply summarize in their mind in one sentence. I wanted it to be like life, where you spend a year of your life and you can’t just remember everything that happened, but it's all part of a process.\"\n\n\n\"Stuck Rubber Baby\" was published with high expectations, given the success of Art Spiegelman's graphic novel \"Maus\" (1991). \"Stuck Rubber Baby\" won a favorable critical reception, but its sales were modest.\n\nThe book won the award for Best Graphic Novel at the Eisners, Harveys, and UK Comic Art Awards. It was nominated for the American Library Association's Lesbian and Gay Book Award and the Lambda Literary Award. It won the 2002 French \"Prix de la critique\" and the \"Luche\" award in Germany.\n\nComics writer Harvey Pekar wrote that, if enough people read it, \"it surely will help convince the general public that comics can appeal to adults.\" Upon its reprinting in 2011, Comics Alliance wrote that Cruse \"harnessed a symphony of discordant subtleties\". Cartoonist and comics scholar Justin Hall wrote of the importance of this work: \"Stuck Rubber Baby, with its complex meditations on race, sexuality, and gender in the Civil Rights era Alabama is perhaps the closest we’ve come yet to the Great American Graphic Novel.\" \n\nThe book has generated some controversy because of its subject matter. In 2004, a Texas citizens' group asked that it be removed from the young adult section of the local library.\n\nCruse's earlier work influenced Alison Bechdel in her comic strip \"Dykes to Watch Out For\". She later published the graphic novels \"Fun Home\" (2006) and \"Are You My Mother?\" (2012), which also deal with an individual's homosexual awakening.\n\n\n\n"}

Written by Franco Migliacci and Domenico Modugno, it was released as a single on 1 February 1958.\n\nWinning the eighth Sanremo Music Festival, the song was chosen as the Italian entry to the Eurovision Song Contest in 1958, where it won third place out of ten songs in total.\nThe combined sales of all the versions of the song exceed 22 million copies worldwide, making it one of the most popular Eurovision songs of all time and the most successful Sanremo Music Festival song ever.\n\nIt spent five non-consecutive weeks atop the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in August and September 1958 and was \"Billboard\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s number-one single for the year. Modugno's recording subsequently became the first Grammy winner for Record of the Year and Song of the Year at the 1st Annual Grammy Awards in 1959.\n\nThe song was later translated into several languages and it was recorded by a wide range of performers.\n\nFranco Migliacci started working on the lyrics of the song in June 1957, inspired by two paintings by Marc Chagall. He had planned to go to the sea with Domenico Modugno, but while waiting for Modugno to show up, Migliacci started drinking wine and eventually fell asleep. He had vivid dreams, and when he woke up, he looked at the Chagall paintings (reproductions) on the wall. In \"Le coq rouge\" was a yellow man suspended in midair, while in \"Le peintre et la modelle\", half the painter's face was coloured blue. So he started penning a song about a man who dreams of painting himself blue, and being able to fly.\nLater that same night, Migliacci discussed his lyrics with Modugno, and for several days they worked on the song, tentatively entitled \"Sogno in blu\" (\"Dream in blue\").\n\nMuch later, in 2008, Franca Gandolfi recalled that her husband, Domenico Modugno, after a storm forced open his window, had the idea of modifying the chorus of the song, introducing the word \"Volare\", which is now the popular title of the song.\n\nThe song is a ballad in a dramatic chanson style, in which Modugno describes the feeling he has, which resembles flying when with his lover. The song opens with a surreal prelude which the cover versions often left out: \"\"Penso che un sogno così non ritorni mai più. Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu; poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito, e incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito.\"\" (\"I think that a dream like that will never return; I painted my hands and my face blue, then was suddenly swept up by the wind and started to fly in the infinite sky.\")\n\nThe English lyrics were written by Mitchell Parish. Alternative English lyrics were written in 1958 by Gracie Fields, and they were used in most concerts she performed in from then until her death in 1979. She often changed the words to suit her performance and age.\n\nIn 1958, the song participated in the selection process for the eighth Sanremo Music Festival, held in 1958. The jury charged with selecting the entries to the competition was going to reject \"Nel blu dipinto di blu\", but in the end it was one of the 20 admitted songs.\n\nOn 31 January 1958, the song was performed for the first time, during the second night of the eighth Sanremo Music Festival, by Domenico Modugno and Johnny Dorelli.\nIt was Dorelli's first appearance on the Sanremo Music Festival. According to his team-partner, Dorelli was so nervous that he had to be punched by Modugno to be persuaded to perform on the stage.\n\nAfter being admitted to the final, held at the Sanremo Casino on 1 February 1958, the song was performed again, and it won the contest, beating the song \"L'edera\" by Nilla Pizzi and Tonina Torrielli, which came in second place.\n\nDorelli's performance didn't have a big impact on the audience, while Modugno's is now considered to be the event which changed the history of Italian music.\nDuring his performance, Modugno opened his arms, as if he was going to fly. This contributed to making it the most successful Sanremo Music Festival song, and marked a change in the way of performing, since Italian singers were used to standing with their arms on their chest, without moving on the stage.\n\nFollowing the first place at the Sanremo Music Festival, the song was chosen to represent Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest 1958, which took place on 12 March in Hilversum, Netherlands. Domenico Modugno was chosen as the singer.\n\nThe song was performed first on the night, preceding the Netherlands' Corry Brokken with \"Heel de wereld\". Due to a transmission fault, the song was not heard in all countries transmitting the event, so it was performed at the end as well, before the voting took place.\nAt the end of the voting, it had received 13 points, placing 3rd in a field of 10. Despite this, it became one of the most successful songs ever performed in Eurovision Song Contest history.\n\nIt was succeeded as Italian entry at the 1959 contest by \"Piove (Ciao, ciao bambina)\", also performed by Modugno.\n\nThe song became an instant success in Italy, selling more than 20,000 copies in its first 12 days. As of February 2013, according to RAI's estimates, the single had sold 800,000 copies in its domestic market.\nFollowing the results obtained in Italy, the song was also released in the United States and in the rest of Europe. In the United Kingdom, Modugno's single was released on 23 August 1958, together with eight other versions recorded by international artists. The single obtained global acclaim, becoming an international hit.\n\nIn the United States, the single debuted at number 54 on the very first \"Billboard\" Hot 100, on 4 August 1958, and the next week it climbed at number two, marking the biggest jump to the runner-up spot in the chart's history. On 18 August 1958, it topped the Hot 100, becoming the second song to reach the top spot on the chart, after Ricky Nelson's \"Poor Little Fool\". The song later completed a run of five non-consecutive weeks at the top of the chart, selling 2 million copies in the United States during 1958 and becoming \"Billboard\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Song of the Year. \"Nel blu dipinto di blu\" was the first non American, Canadian or British single to achieve this honor in the rock era, and it was the only one until 1994's \"The Sign\" by Swedish group Ace of Base.\nIt is also one of the only two songs by Modugno charting on the Hot 100, together with \"Piove (Ciao, ciao bambina)\", which peaked at number 97.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the single debuted at number 15 on 6 September 1958, and the following week it rose and peaked at number ten on the UK Singles Chart. It also peaked at number two on the Norwegian VG-lista Topp 20 Singles and on the Dutch Mega Single Top 100.\n\nThe song's popularity endures, and in 2004, according to the Italian Society of Authors and Publishers, it was the most played Italian song, in Italy as well as in the whole world. Moreover, the combined sales of all the recorded versions of the song exceed 22 million units.\n\nDuring the 1st Grammy Awards, held on 4 May 1959 at Hollywood's Beverly Hilton Hotel, \"Nel blu dipinto di blu\" received two awards, for Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\nThe song is the only foreign-language recording to achieve this honor, and it is the only song competing in the Eurovision Song Contest to receive a Grammy Award.\n\nIn 2001, seven years after his death, Modugno was awarded with the Sanremo Music Festival Special Award, \"given to the one who, [...] in 1958, with \"Nel blu dipinto di blu\", turned the Sanremo Music Festival in a stage of worldwide relevance\". During 2008's Sanremo Music Festival, Franco Migliacci and Modugno's wife, Franca Gandolfi, received the special Award for Creativity for the song \"Nel blu dipinto di blu\". The award was presented by Italian Society of Authors and Publishers' chairman Giorgio Assumma.\n\nIn 2005, a concert was held in Copenhagen, Denmark, to celebrate the . During the event, \"Nel blu dipinto di blu\" was ranked second on the list of the \"all time favourite songs of the Eurovision Song Contest\", behind ABBA's \"Waterloo\". ABBA's former member Benny Andersson, while receiving the prize, commented:\n\nIn 2008, the 50th anniversary of the song was celebrated in Italy by releasing a postage stamp showing a man who is flying on a blue background.\nDuring the 2010 Viña del Mar International Song Festival, the song, performed by Italian singer Simona Galeandro, was also declared the most popular song of the 20th century, winning the international competition of the contest.\n\nImmediately after the release of \"Nel blu dipinto di blu\", Antonio De Marco accused Domenico Modugno and Migliacci of plagiarising his 1956 song \"Il castello dei sogni'\". The song was not released, but it had been played during some concerts in the previous years. As a response, Modugno sued De Marco for defamation, and in July 1958 De Marco was convicted by the Milan court of justice.\n\nDuring the trial for plagiarism, De Marco claimed that he lost his sheet music in Rome, while registering his song with the Italian Society of Authors and Publishers, suggesting that Modugno somehow found it and plagiarised both the lyrics and the music of his composition. However, the Rome court of justice absolved Modugno and Migliacci, following the opinion of an expert who claimed that the two songs don't have any relevant similarity.\n\nCredits adapted from \"Discografia Nazionale della Canzone Italiana\".\n\nAfter the releases by Modugno and Dorelli and following the initial success of Modugno's one, many other versions were quickly recorded and released. The song was also translated in several languages, including French, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish and Portuguese.\n\nIn 1958, Dean Martin included a half-English version of the song, with lyrics adapted by Mitchell Parish, on his LP \"This Is Dean Martin!\" and released it as a single, reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart and peaking at number three in Norway and at number fifteen on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\nDuring the same year, several other versions of the song were released, but did not achieve the same success. A French version of the song, titled \"Dans le Bleu du Ciel Bleu\", was featured on Dalida's \"Les Gitans\". Fud Leclerc, who competed in the Eurovision Song Contest 1958 alongside Domenico Modugno, recorded the French version as well. It was released on the same EP as his own entry for Belgium, \"Ma petite chatte\". In the United Kingdom, Italian musician Marino Marini's cover peaked at number thirteen in October 1958, and Charlie Drake's version reached number 28, while The McGuire Sisters' version, also released in 1958 as a single, peaked at number 80 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US and entered the Norwegian Singles Chart at number seven.\n1958's albums \"El alma de un pueblo\" by Cortijo y su combo and \"The End\" by Earl Grant also included cover versions of the song.\n\nDuring the same year, several Italian artists released their own version of the song, including Fred Buscaglione, Nicola Arigliano, Nilla Pizzi, Gino Latilla, Marino Marini and His Quartet and Claudio Villa.\n\nIn 1960, the song was recorded by Italian-American singer Bobby Rydell, reaching number four on the Hot 100 during the summer of 1960 and number 22 in the UK. In 1986, Rydell's version was featured on the soundtrack of Richard Wenk's horror film \"Vamp\".\n\nAmong the other artists covering the song soon after its release, Connie Francis included it in her 1959's \"Connie Francis sings Italian Favorites\", Chet Atkins covered it for 1963's \"Travelin'\", Ella Fitzgerald recorded it for her 1964's \"Hello, Dolly!\" and Petula Clark sang it for the album \"The International Hits\", released in 1965.

The county ceased to exist when the province of New Brunswick was created in 1784. \n\nThe county was created in 1765, alongside a formal enlargement of Cumberland County north and westward (taking in present-day Westmoreland and Albert Counties, New Brunswick). Sunbury County's seat and its court of general sessions were established at Campobello Island, in Passamaquoddy Bay. \n\nCampobello was fairly central on the coast under its purview, as Sunbury included what the Province of Massachusetts regarded as the eastern portion of its district of Maine. (In practice, neither Boston nor Halifax were interested in expending energy or money to administer the area so the geographic overlap was permitted to exist.) \n\nIn 1784, in part due to the immigration to Nova Scotia of many thousands of Loyalists refugees, Sunbury County, with the newer, mainland portion of Cumberland, became the Colony of New Brunswick. British recognition of U.S. Independence had necessitated the turnover of the western third of Sunbury to the District of Maine, then still part of Massachusetts. \n\nAfter much redefinition and reduction in subsequent decades, there remains in central New Brunswick a county holding the name Sunbury. \n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nEconomic activities in Bacnotan mostly involve farming, fishing, bee-keeping, pebble extraction, tourism and Portland cement manufacture. Bacnotan is the seat of the beekeeping industry in La Union. A mining engineer from Bacnotan who saw the limestone deposits in Dumarang (renamed Quirino) also saw deposits of coal and traces of gas.\n\nSurfing has become quite popular as well, surfers having discovered that there is a surfable break beside the Holcim Cement Factory. While there are no surfboard rentals yet, instructors from the nearby town of Urbiztondo have been known to bring their students to Bacnotan for lessons. The sand bottom causes an inconsistency in wave quality but is usually reliable for learning.\n\nSchools in Bacnotan include the Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University, the North Provincial High School (now Bacnotan National High School), the Bacnotan Elementary School, other elementary schools located in various barangays, and a prep school operated by the United Church of Christ in the Philippines in Bacnotan.\n\nBacnotan is bounded on the north by Balaoan, on the east by San Gabriel, on the south by San Juan, and on the west by the South China Sea.\n\nThe western side of Bacnotan faces the South China Sea and has a long stretch of black sand beaches, indicating a large amount of magnetite. Some portions of the seashore have pebble and limestone deposits. The beaches, stretching about 16 kilometers, are suitable for fishing, boating, swimming, snorkeling, diving and surfing.\n\nAlthough San Juan is a favorite place among serious surfers, the waves in Quirino have been discovered to be likewise excellent for surfing.\n\nThe Baroro River, located at the southern boundary of Bacnotan, provides fresh water fishing, aquaculture farming and recreation.\n\nBacnotan is from Metro Manila and from San Fernando, the provincial capital.\n\nClimate in Bacnotan is dry from November to May and wet from mid-May to October. The south-west monsoon brings an abundant rainfall experienced during the wet season. The relatively dry season is caused by the north-east monsoon passing over the Cordillera Mountain Range. Average temperature is .\n\nBacnotan is politically subdivided into 47 barangays, listed here with their respective populations as of May 1, 2010.\nThe town of Bacnotan was formally founded in 1599 as part of Ilocos Sur. In 1785, during the administration of the Governor-General Jose Basco, Bacnotan became a part of Pangasinan. When La Union was created in 1850, Bacnotan was one of the 12 towns that formed the province.\n\nIn the past, Bacnotan was only a vast expanse of wilderness inhabited by natives with a rudimentary form of government. There was a time when it was ruled by a despotic chieftain who had absolute control over all his constituents. Disobedience to his directives meant severe flogging of the culprit. After several years under the tyrannical rule of the chieftain, the people overthrew him and flogged their chieftain to death. The word \"\"basnutan\"\" means \"flog\" in the local dialect, and become a byword among the inhabitants, hence the name of the town. During the Spanish period, the name of the town was changed from \"basnutan\" to \"Bacnotan\" as shown by documents which are still kept intact at the National Archives in Manila.\n\nThe town's history is linked with the deeds of heroic men who fought, bled, and died for their own native land. At the turn of the century, during the Spanish–American War, Dumarang (now known as Quirino), was a scene of carnage and plunder.\n\nDuring the first days of World War II, invading Japanese forces reached Bacnotan on December 21, 1941.\n\nOn January 4, 1945, the tides of war changed in La Union as Filipino and American soldiers captured the strategic Baroro Bridge in Bacnotan, which connects the rest of Northern Luzon to San Fernando. It was followed by the historic Battle of San Fernando and Bacsil Bridge. The victory ensured the liberation of La Union Province by joint Filipino and American troops at the end of World War II.\n\nAfter the war, Bacnotan became the provisional seat of provincial government, since San Fernando was then in ruins. As a consequence of this transfer, the La Union National High School was also moved to Bacnotan. When things went back to normal, the provincial government was again moved to San Fernando and the La Union National High School followed afterwards. The transfer of the provincial high school in Bacnotan resulted in the establishment of the North Provincial High School (now Bacnotan National High School.)\n\nIn 1949, the vast mineral deposits of limestone used in portland cement production were noticed in Barrio Dumarang (now Quirino) by a mining engineer who was then a municipal councilor at that time. Because of the desire to create economic activity, the municipal council, through the efforts of this mining engineer, invited potential investors to set up a Portland cement plant. Within a year, a cement plant called Cebu Portland Cement (CEPOC), was established. On May 11, 1957, CEPOC, a government-owned corporation, was sold to the privately owned Bacnotan Consolidated Industries (BCI). BCI is the manufacturer of \"Union Cement\". In 2004, BCI was sold to Holcim Cement.\n\nOn June 18, 1960, the La Union Agricultural School was established.

In the middle of the 18th century, the municipality is part of the township of Allabok which covers the moderate slopes of the mountain ranges overlooking the China Sea. During those times, war tribes was prevalent. Allabok involved itself in a tribal war headed by Bagulin who led the community to victory. From then on until his death, people highly regarded him as their noble leader. After his death, consensus with the residents together with the concurrence of Spanish authorities resulted in naming the community after Bagulin. At present, Kankanaey still dominate the town’s population.\n\nAnother etymological version dictates that \"Bagulin\" was derived from the term \"bago\" which means \"lowland natives\". This version is further supported by the fact that Kankanaeys comprise about 85% of the municipal population.\n\nBagulin is situated at the interior eastern portion of La Union. It is generally mountainous and forested. It is bounded by the following municipalities:\n\nBagulin is away from San Fernando, the regional center, away from Naguilian, its nearby town and away from Baguio City. The main entrance to lowland municipalities is through the Naguilian-Bagulin Road. It can be reached by vehicles and any regular means of transportation through the town of Naguilian.\n\nBagulin is politically subdivided into 10 barangays.\nThe community was moved to Picdel, a narrow valley strip along Naguilian-Bagulin river. By 1903, the American regime established a paramilitary government and institutional facilities. Education was introduced and a bamboo community hall roofed with cogon was erected. As of 1903, the community was under the jurisdiction of the Mountain Province, sub-province of Benguet with capital at La Trinidad. By 1918, under the agreement of Governor Guzman of Mt. Province and Governor Pio Ancheta of La Union, Bagulin became a municipal district of Burgos under the province of La Union.\n\nBy 1928, the community centers was moved to a nearby settlement called Suyo where the present town center is situated. The former community center was named “Nangalisan” which means an abandoned place in the Ilokano language. Settlers who improved Suyo were Ilokano people who came from Naguilian. At that time, a bamboo chalet was constructed to serve as an administrative hall. The administration then was composed of the Mayor, a Secretary-Treasurer and one policeman. Municipal income is very small that the administration had to prod reluctant taxpayers to pay their dues.\n\nOn June 25, 1963, Bagulin was transformed into a regular, full-pledged municipality by virtue of \"Executive Order No. 42\".\n\nIn the , the population of Bagulin was people, with a density of .\n\nThe town is home to one National Cultural Treasure of the Philippines, which is the Burial Caves of Sitio Alabok in Barangay Cambali.\n\n"}

The town's present name originated during the Spanish colonial era. A group of Spanish soldiers were on patrol and went on to rest on a sitio. The villagers were curious about the soldiers because of their unusual descent and fair skin color. They flocked the soldiers touching their guns, too afraid that the guns might explode accidentally, one villager asked the soldier in a local vernacular.. \"Aoan bala?\" (meaning \"No bullets?\"). The soldier did not understand what the villager meant, he uttered the last word first, and remembering the last, he said \"Bala-aoan\".\n\nDuring the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, a secret society of \"insurrectos\" was organized in the municipality. Its purpose was to fight and revolt against the Spanish Government in the area. On the eve of the revolution, a traitor told the Spanish of their plan. The Spanish soldiers, without any investigation arrested seven members of the secret society, and executed them the same night. Only one, Fernando Ostrea, escaped with leg wounds.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe name Bangar derives from the \"bangar\" tree (\"Sterculia foetida\"), which was once abundant in the general area of the present town. The bangar tree is notable for the foul odor that emanates from its flowers.\n\nThe northernmost town of La Union, alongside Sudipen, Bangar is also the smallest municipality in the province with an area of . It is bounded by the South China Sea to the west, Sudipen to the east, and Balaoan and Luna to the south-west. The Amburayan River flows to the north of Bangar, separating it from Tagudin, Ilocos Sur.\n\nBangar is from Metro Manila and from San Fernando, the provincial capital.\n\n\n1700 marked the official foundation of Bangar under the patronage of Saint Christopher, when it became a mission field. However, Christianity was brought as early as the later part of 1500, when Bangar was still a \"visita\" (chapelry) of Tagudin, with a community of 2,800 inhabitants. The highly skilled, industrious and peace-loving people were primarily engaged in rice and cotton planting. The beautiful and sturdy handwoven products made by the women of that time even found their way to Europe and it was said that some of these materials were used as boat sails by European seamen. Among the more famous handwoven products made by them were blankets bearing different designs, clothing materials and mosquito nets. Since chemicals for coloring were very scarce those days, the bark of trees and fruit were used to dye those handwoven products.\n\nThe old town was made of three \"pueblitos\" (small towns) namely: Villa-Cruz, San Rafael and San Anastacio. Near these pueblitos were small communities of \"Igorotes Infieles\" who paid tribute to the Governor.\n\nThrough the \"Superior Decreto\" (Executive Decree) signed by Governor General Antonio Maria Blanco on March 2, 1850, the town of Bangar was made part of the newly created province of La Union. Prior to this, Bangar, Purao (Balaoan) and Namacpacan (Luna) were part of Ilocos Sur. As the years passed by, barrios were formed.\n\nEducation during Spanish times consisted of learning the \"Cartilla\" and the \"abecedario\". Roman Catholic religion was taught hand-in-hand with good manners. However, formal education was given to students belonging to the upper class. Spanish social life had greatly affected the \"Indios\" and in no time, Castilian manners were very evident among them.\n\nThe social class of an individual was easily distinguished by the kind of attire one wore. Male peasants were distinguished by their simple \"camisa de chino\" and loose pants tied to the waist by braided strings. Female peasants wore simple loose blouses and ankle length skirts, with a \"camison\", made from cotton fabric, worn underneath. The peasantry were usually barefooted, and if there was anything worn on the feet, it was the \"kammadang\" (wooden shoes) or a pair of slippers.\n\nMen of the upper class were distinguished by the \"barong\" and \"camisa de chino\" made of fine fabric, and trousers cut in the western style. He wore socks and leather shoes and on the head was a hat, which was usually plumed. A walking cane in various styles and colors and encased in gold, silver or bronze was indispensable. He never smoked without using a pipe.\n\nThe upper class lady was very fastidious. She had her hair done in a brushed up coiffure. They curled their hair by using the stem of the papaya leaf and iron rod which was heated over burning charcoal. However, so much care was given using this method. Other women preferred to tie their hair in curls in the evening and untie it in the morning. Ladies wore the \"Maria Clara\" or the \"camisa\" with embroidered and stitched butterfly sleeves and matching \"panuelo\". They used \"alfiler\" (pins) made of gold or silver. A comb called \"peineta\", usually fan-shaped and encrusted with silver or gold, adorned their hair. The skirt, which was usually billowy, was made from very fine fabric from China. Underneath she wore a long \"camison\" and over it the \"nuagas\". The outer skirt was still topped by beautiful imported lace. A perfumed fan and a big handkerchief trimmed with lace, hanging on the right side of the skirt tucked to her waistline, was part of the attire. On Sundays and holidays of obligation, a \"mantilla\" made of lace, which covered the head down to the waist and tucked to the hair by a gold pin was obligatory for the Holy Mass. On the feet, the lady wore a \"zapatilla\", usually half-heeled and adorned with artificial rhinestones. A gold pendant hanging from a gold necklace around the neck was also part of the attire. The \"tamborine\", a gold necklace with intricate designs was also worn on special days.\n\nUS-styled education was implemented with the coming of the Americans in 1898. Education had a very high standard then, such that one who finished the fourth grade could teach those who were in the lower years.\n\nThe impact of World War II was first felt in Bangar on December 8, 1941, the feast of the Immaculate Conception. A lantern competition, which was sponsored by Rev. Jose Brillantes, the parish priest, was hastily cancelled and church goers had to hurry home after the Holy Mass as they immediately prepared for evacuation. On December 20, 1941, the Japanese Army entered Bangar. They put up sentries along the national road and also had one at the Municipal building and another at the plaza. The Japanese occupation required all citizens to display and pin small Japanese flags outside the pocket of the shirt or blouse with the name of the holder written in Japanese. According to them, this was to distinguished peaceful citizens from guerrillas.\n\nSometime in 1944, on the day Bangar was celebrating the birthday of Emperor Hirohito with a program at the town plaza, a truck load of Japanese soldiers arrived with a lone Filipino who was said to have been captured somewhere in Bacnotan. It was told that the Japanese took the Filipino behind the southern school building and ordered him to dig what was to be his own grave. Upon sensing that his hours on earth were counted, the Filipino suddenly grabbed and unsheathed the sword of an officer who was standing nearby and in one hit motion with the sword, the officer almost got beheaded. This stunned the Japanese soldiers and the Filipino was able to escape unhurt. The whole town was gripped in terror, since this would mean Japanese reprisals—on December 28, 1944, the Japanese burned many houses in the town proper and raided the camp of the guerrillas in barrio San Cristobal.\n\nThe Underground Movement was very strong during the Japanese occupation of Bangar. Many residents joined the guerrillas, who had put up camps in San Cristobal. Further in the mountains at Lonoy, they also joined \"Camp 121\". Colonel Volkman and Major Agtarap led the guerrilla movement. The arms that were supplied to the guerrillas landed at Paraoir and men had to carry bolos at nighttime.\n\nThe first Americans to reach Bangar during its liberation were a certain Captain Roberts with his men.\n\nDuring the Northern Luzon Campaign, Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and units of the 1st, 2nd, 12th, 13th, 15th and 16th Infantry Divisions and the USAFIP-NL 121st Infantry Regiment started the liberation campaign in Bangar in 1945 and helped guerrilla resistance fighters and the U.S. liberation forces against Japanese Imperial Army forces towards the end of the war.\n\nToday, Bangar is known for its handwoven cloth called \"abel\" and blacksmithing (\"panday\"). Its agricultural products include rice, corn, sugar cane, peanuts, sweet potatoes, vegetables, and Virginia tobacco.\n\n\nAccording to the , the population of Bangar, La Union, was people, with a density of .\n\n\n\nThe town has 16 public elementary schools, two national high schools, a private school (offering complete pre-elementary, elementary, and high school education), one specialized high school, one technical-vocational school, and one tertiary school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2068765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068765", "title": "Sixteenth Dynasty of Egypt", "text": "Sixteenth Dynasty of Egypt\n\nThe Sixteenth Dynasty of ancient Egypt (notated Dynasty XVI) was a dynasty of pharaohs that ruled the Theban region in Upper Egypt for 70 years.\n\nThis dynasty, together with Dynasties XV and XVII, are often combined under the group title, Second Intermediate Period (c. 1650–1580 BC), a period that saw the division of Upper and Lower Egypt between the pharaohs at Thebes and the Hyksos kings of the 15th dynasty based at Avaris.\nOf the two chief versions of Manetho's \"Aegyptiaca\", Dynasty XVI is described by the more reliable Africanus (supported by Syncellus) as \"shepherd [\"hyksos\"] kings\", but by Eusebius as Theban.\n\nRyholt (1997), followed by Bourriau (2003), in reconstructing the Turin canon, interpreted a list of Thebes-based kings to constitute Manetho's Dynasty XVI, although this is one of Ryholt's \"most debatable and far-reaching\" conclusions. For this reason other scholars do not follow Ryholt and see only \"insufficient\" evidence for the interpretation of the Sixteenth Dynasty as Theban.\n\nThe continuing war against Dynasty XV dominated the short-lived 16th Dynasty. The armies of the 15th Dynasty, winning town after town from their southern enemies, continually encroached on the 16th Dynasty territory, eventually threatening and then conquering Thebes itself. In his study of the Second Intermediate Period, the Egyptologist Kim Ryholt has suggested that Dedumose I sued for a truce in the latter years of the dynasty, but one of his predecessors, Nebiryraw I, may have been more successful and seems to have enjoyed a period of peace in his reign.\n\nFamine, which had plagued Upper Egypt during the late 13th Dynasty and the 14th Dynasty, also blighted the 16th Dynasty, most evidently during and after the reign of Neferhotep III.\n\nVarious chronological orderings and lists of kings have been proposed by scholars for this dynasty. These lists fall broadly in two categories: those assuming that the 16th Dynasty comprised vassals of the Hyksos, as advocated by Jürgen von Beckerath and Wolfgang Helck; and those assuming that the 16th Dynasty was an independent Theban kingdom, as recently proposed by Kim Ryholt.\n\nThe traditional list of rulers of the 16th Dynasty regroups kings believed to be vassals of the Hyksos, some of which have semitic names such as Semqen and Anat-her. The list of kings differs from scholar to scholar and it is here given as per Jürgen von Beckerath's Dynasty XV/XVI in his \"Handbuch der ägyptischen Königsnamen\". Wolfgang Helck, who also believes that the 16th Dynasty was an Hyksos vassal state, proposed a slightly different list of kings. Many of the rulers listed here in the 16th Dynasty under the hypothesis that they were vassals of the Hyksos are put in the 14th Dynasty in the hypothesis that the 16th Dynasty was an independent Theban kingdom. The chronological ordering is largely uncertain.\n\nIn his 1997 study of the Second Intermediate Period, the Danish Egyptologist Kim Ryholt argues that the 16th Dynasty was an independent Theban kingdom. From Ryholt's reconstruction of the Turin canon, 15 kings can be associated to the dynasty, several of whom are attested by contemporary sources. While most likely rulers based in Thebes itself, some may have been local rulers from other important Upper Egyptian towns, including Abydos, El Kab and Edfu. By the reign of Nebiriau I, the realm controlled by the 16th Dynasty extended at least as far north as Hu and south to Edfu. Not listed in the Turin canon (after Ryholt) is Wepwawetemsaf, who left a stele at Abydos and was likely a local kinglet of the Abydos Dynasty.\n\nRyholt gives the list of kings of the 16th Dynasty as shown in the table below. Others, such as Helck, Vandersleyen, Bennett combine some of these rulers with the Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt. The list of rulers is given here as per Kim Ryholt and is supposedly in chronological order:\n\nAdditional kings are classified as belonging to this dynasty per Kim Ryholt but their chronological position is uncertain. They may correspond to the last five lost kings on the Turin canon:\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nNaguilian is from Baguio City via the Naguilian Road and from the provincial capital, San Fernando.\n\nOriginally a part of Bauang in the province of Pangasinan, Naguilian derived its name from the Iloko phrase “Nag-ili-an dagiti gan-ganaet” meaning “a place where people from other places come to stay”. It is formed from the Iloko root word “ili” meaning “town” which was later modified as “Naguilian”.\n\nIts separation from Bauang coincided with the centennial celebration of the Catholic Church of Naguilian in 1839. When La Union was created by a Royal Decree in 1850, Naguilian was one of the twelve (12) towns that comprised the province.\n\nDue to increasing population density, a group of immigrants drifted to the shore of La Union and began building the town of Bauang at the south of the river and settled thereat. Later, however, due to population explosion, they followed the meander of the river in search of a new territory. They found a fertile valley at the bank of the river, which they called Naguilian. They built a colony at the fork of the two (2) rivers and began developing the territory. They were the first inhabitants of Naguilian.\n\nRecords have shown that when the Ilocanos arrived in town, Igorot settlers are already at par. At present, “natives” as the Igorots are popularly called can still be found at the southern and northern parts of the town while majority of the Ilocanos are settled at the lowlands.\n\nDuring its establishment as a town, it was believed that a few portions of Burgos and Bagulin were originally a part of Naguilian. These include the lower portion of Burgos known as “Disdis” meaning “a small barrio” and the barangays along the southwestern bank of the Naguilian River (Bagulin portion). “Disdis” was also called “Stancia” by the Spaniards as it served as a pasture ground for their horses while the portion which eventually became a part of Bagulin was predominantly inhabited by the Igorots. \n\nHowever, during the American Regime, by virtue of a Resolution of the Provincial Government of La Union, Naguilian was divided into three portions namely, that portion which became the town of Naguilian, that portion forming part of Burgos and that portion forming part of Bagulin.\n\nThe earliest political system used during the Spanish colonial period was the “encomienda” system. Under this system, the native inhabitants in a given geographic region were entrusted to conquistadores, friars and native nobles in exchange for their services to the King. In return, the person granted the encomienda, known as an encomiendero, were given the privilege to collect tribute from its inhabitants and to provide military protection, justice and governance. The encomienda system however was abused by encomienderos and by 1700 was largely replaced by administrative units. With the main purpose of governance and tax collection, small towns or pueblos were ruled by Gobernadorcillos and Capitanes.\n\nNaguilian is characterized by hills and mountains that are gently rolling, bordered by the Cordillera Mountains in the east. The alienable lands are rolling plains in narrow strips, framed by the mountains slopes and the banks of rivers, crisscrossed by streams and springs from the side of the mountains. Its soil varies from clay loam to sandy loam and golds.\n\nThere are two major rivers in Naguilian. The Naguilian River is located in the western portion of the town. It flows westward beginning from the province of Benguet towards La Union and empties into the South China Sea, draining the valleys of Barangays Bimmotobot, Mamat-ing Sur, Mamat-ing Norte, Tuddingan, Gusing Sur, Gusing Norte, Baraoas Norte, Daramuangan, Dal-lipaoen, Cabaritan Sur, Ortiz, Natividad, Suguidan Norte and Suguidan Sur. It has a length of approximately and has a basin area of . As classified by the Environmental Management Bureau, the upper reaches of the river falls under Class A which means that it is suitable as water supply source for drinking. The lower reaches has lower water quality, categorized under Class C.\n\nThe other major stream springs from the Municipality of Burgos and drains the valleys of Barangays Aguioas, Sili, Al-alinao Norte, Nagsidorisan, Angin, Suguidan Norte and Natividad. These two rivers meet at the poblacion where it forms a delta, then meander through the center of the municipality and empty at the mouth of the river in Bauang.\n\nThe municipality’s climate falls under the first type of climate in the Philippines, characterized by two (2) distinct seasons, wet and dry. The wet season usually comes in May and ends in the early part of October. The rest of the year is dry season.\n\nBuilt-up areas of the town are generally spread along the barangay roads. Of the total land area, , equivalent to 0.50% of the total land area, are classified as built-up areas. Urban built-up area, totaling , constitute 11.22% of the total urban land area. Rural built-up areas total , or 0.31% of the total rural area.\n\nThrough \"Proclamation No. 52\", a portion of Barangay Casilagan, with an area of , was proclaimed as a watershed area by the Bureau of Forestry. This is equivalent to .10% of the total land area of the town.\n\nIn the , the population of Naguilian was people, with a density of .\n\nGenerally, the agricultural lands are narrow strips in the valleys, running from the sides of the mountains to the bank of the rivers, brooks and streams. The rolling areas from the top of the mountains and hills are also utilized for the planting of rice and other crops. The area devoted for agricultural purposes, which totals constituting 97% of the total land area.\n\nIndustries in the different parts of the municipality include woodcraft, metal craft, bamboo craft, ceramics or brick making, concrete hollow block making, \"basi\" (sugarcane wine) making and furniture making and upholstery, .28% of the total land area of the town is devoted for industrial purposes.\n\nThe center of commercial activities is the public market located in Barangay Ortiz. There are, however, other commercial establishments found in the different barangays, the most common of which are sari-sari stores. The area devoted for commerce constitutes .03% of the total land area of the town.\n\nFishing is done in almost all barangays traversed by the rivers, namely, Barangays Bimmotobot, Mamat-ing Sur, Mamat-ing Norte, Gusing Norte, Gusing Sur, Baraoas Norte, Baraoas Sur, Ortiz, Cabaritan Norte, Cabaritan Sur, Dal-lipaoen, Nagsidorisan, Suguidan Norte, Suguidan Sur, Guesset, Sili, Al-alinao Norte, Al-alinao Sur, Aguioas and Ribsuan.\n\n\n\n"}

The municipality is also known for its native delicacies and pottery products which are comparable to San Juan's.\n\nThe town is a pilgrimage site as it enshrines the \"Apo Baket Namacpacan\", a wooden Marian image.\n\nOn the beach of barangay Victoria rests the ruins of an old Spanish watch tower, locally named as \"Balauarte\". The tower was intended to guard the shores of the town primarily from Muslim and pirate attacks during the Spanish period. During World War II, the tower served as the communication tower post for a temporary airfield for the USAFIP-NL forces. Due to years of quarrying within the site of the tower (1980 to 2000), the coastline receded and sea waves severely damaged the foundation of the tower, which eventually caused major damage to its structure. At present, efforts were initiated to preserve the tower from further damage.\n\nLuna has Public Elementary schools in each barangay. There are 6 public high schools (\"Luna National Science High School - Central\" in Barangay Barrientos, \"LNHS - Rimos\" and \"Cantoria Annex\"; and \"Oanari National High School\") \"Bungro-Sucoc Integrated School\" in Bungro, \"Luna Technical Vocational High School\" and 1 Private High School (Santa Catalina Academy).\n\n\n"}

It is accessible via the MacArthur Highway, or via the NLEX (North Luzon Expressway) and TPLEX (Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway) which will have its terminus at this town.\n\nThere are several legends that explain how Rosario first got its name. The best known says that the name \"Rosario\" came from the phrase “rosas del rio,” a reference to the beautiful landscape of the area when it was first discovered by Spaniards, with narrow valleys, wild animals, birds, rivers, brooks, dense forest, and the riverscape.\n\nAnother version or story suggests that name was a reference to the long range of foothills visible to the west of the Poblacion, which appear like big Rosary beads, forming a long, rocky, giant rosary.\n\nYet another legend first documented in 1887 associates the name of the town with a legendary creature called a Marukos (spelled \"manrukos\" in the 1887 text). In the legend, a group of youths were playing around and being noisy while loitering around near the floodplains of the Bued River between Rosario and Sison on a Sunday. They were then confronted by an old man in white garb, whose flesh looked like a corpse - the Marukos. The creature accused them of engaging in leisure activities on a holy day and put a curse on them, causing them to lose their sense of direction. As a result, they failed to notice that they were about to be swept away by one of the flash floods that often plagued the river. In the end, only a young girl survived the encounter with the Marukos, by clinging to a \"Balingkawanay\" (Pittosporum pentandrum) tree. According to the account, some stories claim that the girl had survived by praying the Rosary, while other stories say that her name was Rosario.

It is also north of Manila.\n\nThe total land area of San Juan is , which is 4% of the province of La Union. Some 505.08 hectares or 8.46% is claimed by the municipality of Bacnotan and San Fernando City.\n\nThe climate in San Juan is \"dry\" from November to April and \"wet\" from May to October. The south-west monsoon brings abundant rainfall during the wet season, whereas the north-east monsoon passing over the Cordillera Mountains to the east brings the drier conditions. The average annual temperature is .\n\nSan Juan is politically subdivided into 41 barangays.\nPrior to the arrival of the Spanish, San Juan was an Ilocano settlement called Dalandan, which is the name of the fruit Citrus aurantium Linn. that grew abundantly in the area.\n\nIn 1582, San Juan was proclaimed a mission station under the authority of the Augustinian Order, as recorded by the Nueva Segovia Bi-centennial souvenir booklet dated April 25, 1587. By 1586 the town had become the center of the parish, and was renamed San Juan by the Augustinian Fathers after the Catholic Patron Saint of San Juan Bautista. The town boasted an Augustinian convent and a population of 6,000. Its first priest was Friar Agustin Niño.\n\nThe center of the parish was subsequently transferred to Bauang, with San Juan sometimes being an out-station \"(visita)\" of Bauang and sometimes of Bacnotan. In 1707 the Church of St. John the Baptist was constructed at San Juan. In 1772, the mission station was placed under the authority of the Dominican Order. In 1807, San Juan was established as a parish in its own right.\n\nOn March 2, 1850, San Juan became part of the province of La Union, when the province was created by Governor-General Antonio Maria Blanco.\n\nIn 1898 during the latter days of the Philippine Revolution, the whole of San Juan was razed to the ground by a great fire. With the demise of the church, convent and rectory, the church registers were destroyed, although subsequent registers from 1898 to 1917 do survive and have been microfilmed. Municipal birth registers were begun in 1922.\n\nAfter the Spanish–American War, Father Mariano Gaerlan was appointed priest. He was a native of San Juan, the first Filipino priest for the town, and one of the \"Nine Clerics\" of Nueva Segovia who fought in the revolution. He also began the reconstruction of the church in 1902, which was completed under his successor, Father Eustaquio Ocampo.\n\nAnother local resident, also named Mariano Gaerlan, wrote \"Biag ti Maysa a Lakay, Wenno Nakaam-ames a Bales\" (i.e., \"Life of an Old Man, or a Dreadful Revenge\") under the pen-name of Batallador. The book was in the local Ilokano language and published in 1909. He was originally from Candon, Ilocos Sur where he also maintained a residence, and an aspiring politician who was never elected to public office. He had several children including Nieves Gaerlan who married Antonio \"Matias\" Aquino, a then Mayor of San Juan, and \"Captain\" Candonino Gaerlan, a guerrilla leader and Filipino war hero.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1945 San Juan was occupied by the invading Japanese forces during World War II.\n\nOn January 19, 1942, Gaerlan co-led the first guerrilla ambush against Japanese forces in the Philippines, which was prosecuted on the southern outskirts of Candon. He was subsequently appointed commander of the Third Battalion of the 121st Infantry Regiment of the United States Armed Forces in the Philippines – Northern Luzon (USAFIP-NL). This regiment is often referred to as the La Union Infantry Regiment, and was commanded by \"Captain\" George M. Barnett. Gaerlan was killed and subsequently beheaded later that same year at San Juan, after he was betrayed by the local chief of police while visiting his sister. His head was stuffed into a jar of alcohol and displayed in the plazas of the towns en route to Candon. There the town mayor convinced the Japanese that this was in poor taste, and the container was thrown into a rice paddy west of the town.\n\nAs the war progressed, crops and local services were destroyed. Food was in short supply.\n\nSan Juan was liberated in 1945 by the soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, Philippine Constabulary and the guerrilla units of the La Union Infantry Regiment during the Battle of San Fernando under Major Russell W. Volckmann on their way to meet the liberating forces of General Douglas MacArthur on the beaches of Lingayen Gulf.\n\nAfter the war, inflation led to the financial crisis of 1950 which was followed by the introduction of import controls. Subsequent government-sponsored irrigation systems and farm technicians led to a slow but assured recovery with increased productivity and profitability.\n\nIn the , the population of San Juan, La Union, was people, with a density of .\n\nAccording to a local 1896 census, the population of San Juan was 10,510. At that time, there were twenty-eight barrios inhabited by 9,989 residents, and four rancherias inhabited by 521 \"infieles\" or non-Christians (\"Igorots\"). These barrios were Ili, Barraca, Panicsican, Talogtog, Sabangan, Taboc, Lubing, Sinapangan, Cacapian, Caculangan, Santa Rosa, Caaniyan, Oaquing, Catdongan, Caarusipan, Guinguinabang, Bugbugcao, Pacpacac, Legleg, Nadsaag, Capacuan, Bacnotan, Dasay, Al-langigan, Bombuneg, Balballosa, Duplas and San Felipe. The rancherias were Rancho de Locutan, Indang, Amontoc and Losoya. Yli, also known as Poblacion, had a population of 1,134 residents described as 2 \"Españoles peninsulares\", 2 \"Mestizos de español\", 1,122 \"naturales\" and 8 \"Chinos\".\n\nIn the early 1900s cholera was a scourge that took the lives of many people.\n\nAs of the census of 2000, San Juan was home to 30,393 indigenous Ilocano people, concentrated in six barangays along the national highway. This is equivalent to 33.86% of the total population and is growing at the rate of 1.8% per annum. The average population density was 2,964 persons per square kilometer. In the two urban barangays where some 15% of the population reside, the population density rose to 3,073 persons per square kilometer, while in the remaining rural barangays the population density was 2,886 persons per square kilometer.\n\nSan Juan is considered to be the Surfing Capital of the Northern Philippines, and is known for its consistent intermediate quality surf and two surfing seasons from July to October and November to March.\n\nThere is also a local museum, Museo de San Juan.\n\nPottery, blanket-weaving, basketry, bamboo-craft and broom-making are produced as a folk-industry. Hollow concrete blocks are manufactured in the rural villages for local building projects.\n\nYellow corn is one of the most important crops in San Juan, and is used as a raw material for food and industrial products such as starch, corn oil, beverages, gluten, snacks etc. It constitutes about 50% of the feed for local livestock and poultry enterprises. It was nominated as the product for the \"One Town One Product (OTOP) Philippines\" program of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to promote entrepreneurship and create jobs.\n\n"}

In this regard, the town's \"Nutri-Enriched Seaweed Noodles\" bagged the First Place in the Aquatic Technology Competition and Marketplace, Phil. Council Aquaculture and Marine Research and Development on January 28, 2010.\n\nLa Union's Damortis barangay of Santo Tomas is dubbed as the 'Tabo-an of the North’ because of its priceless 'danggit' (often associated with the small malaga), the dalag-baybay, espada, sapsap, pusit, turay, dilis, and shrimp, a local fish, 1 foot basasong, dried bangus (milkfish), patis (fish sauce), alamang, and bagoong.\n\nThe natives are deeply religious as demonstrated by their devotion to the Senora Virgen del Mar Cautiva (Virgen of the Sea, patron saint of the town fishermen, whose Feast Day is celebrated every 26 April) at Poblacion, and the Holy Guardian Angels.\n\nSanto Tomas' cultural treasure is the 1785 Holy Guardian Angels Parish Church, which celebrates the Patronal Fiesta on October 2. Its Parish Priests are Father Raul S. Panay & Fr. Emmanuel Bahiwag under the Vicariate of St. Francis Xavier under Vicar Forane, Fr. Joel Angelo Licos, under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Fernando de La Union (Latin: \"Dioecesis Ferdinandopolitanus ab Unione\", Dioecesis Ferdinandopolitana ab Unione, Suffragan of Lingayen – Dagupan), a diocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines. The diocese was established in 1970 from the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia.\n\nIn 1845, Padre Santiago Romero, Kura Paroko's devotion to the \"Virgin of the Rosaries\" caused the carving of 3 religious statues for the Church: the Blessed Mother, St. Michael the Archangel and the Holy Guardian Angels (patron of the Church).\n\n\"Matutina\" through the China Sea is held yearly on July, where the 3 images are inserted in 3 boxes and delivered to Santo Tomas by sailboat.\n\nIn Bolinao, Pangasinan, Jolo pirates seized the \"Matutina\" and threw the 3 boxes of the statues into the sea, after severing the left forearm of the Virgin Mary. The 2 boxes sank but the Virgin's miraculously floated dry and sent to Santo Tomas parish priest.\n\nNuestra Señora del Mar Cautiva statue was enthroned at the Church on July 19, 1845 amid innumerable miracles, conversions, healing, including safe and easy childbirth.\n\nAugustinian friar, Padre Lorenzo Rodriguez replaced the holy statue's lost arm with a golden forearm, then with ivory arm but to no avail, until the natives merely used metal strings to tie the same, until this day.\n\n"}

The word \"Samjhauta\" means \"agreement\", \"accord\" and \"compromise\" in both Hindi and Urdu.\n\nUntil the reopening of the Thar Express, this was the only rail connection between the two countries. The train was started on 22 July 1976 following the Shimla Agreement and ran between Amritsar and Lahore, a distance of about 52 km. Following disturbances in Punjab in the late eighties, due to security reasons Indian Railways decided to terminate the service at Attari, where customs and immigration clearances take place. On 14 April 2000, in an agreement between Indian Railways and Pakistan Railways (PR), the distance was revised to cover just under three km. \n\nThe train running between Amritsar and Lahore and vice versa, From 28th October, 1954 to 30th November, 1954, 8,239 persons travelled from India to Pakistan and 10,360 from Pakistan to India. \n\nIt was a daily train when the service started, and changed to a bi-weekly schedule in 1994. Earlier the rakes were returned to the home country the same day but later in 2000 the rake remained overnight at that location.\n\nIts termini are Lahore in Pakistan and Delhi in India. The border crossing takes place between Wagah in Pakistan and Attari in India. Originally, this was a through service with the same rake going all the way between the termini; later the Pakistani rake stopped at Attari at which point passengers had to change trains.\n\nNow there is a train from Delhi to Attari where all passengers alight for customs and immigration. This train does not have any commercial stops between Delhi and Attari. It is incorrectly referred to as the Samjhauta Express and it is officially known as the Delhi-Attari or Attari-Delhi Express. The actual Samjhauta Express runs from Attari to Lahore, although the passengers are checked at Wagah, the first station on the Pakistani side. The train service was set up with an agreement between Indian Railways (IR) and Pakistan Railways (PR) to alternately use an Indian and a Pakistani rake and locomotive for the train, six months at a time.\n\nThe train usually has between four and eight coaches. The rake supplied by Pakistan is usually hauled by an Alco DL-543 class ALU20 diesel loco (Lahore shed), with the entire train in the standard dark green livery of PR.\n\nThe train's first break of service was when it was discontinued on 1 January 2002 in the wake of the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament on 13 December 2001. Service resumed on 15 January 2004. Service was also suspended following the 27 December 2007, assassination of Benazir Bhutto as a preventive measure to deny militants a \"high-value target\" that was of great symbolic importance to both India and Pakistan.\n\nOn 8 October 2012, police recovered about 100 kg of contraband heroin and more than 500 rounds of bullet ammunition at Wagah border on the train heading for Delhi.\n\nOn 28 February 2019, the service was suspended following the 2019 India–Pakistan standoff. A spokesman for the Pakistan Foreign Office said that service was suspended \"in view of the prevailing tensions between Pakistan and India\" while it was reported that India has suspended the running of the train on its side, due to \"drastic decline in occupancy\" and \"the suspension of services from across the border\".\n\nOn 8 August 2019, the service was suspended by Pakistan following the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu And Kashmir.\n\nIn the early hours of 19 February 2007, 70 people (mostly Pakistani civilians and a few Indian military guarding the train) were killed and scores more injured in a terrorist attack on the Delhi - Attari Express. The attack occurred at Diwana station near the Indian city of Panipat, Haryana. Officials found evidence of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), (RDX) containing Fragmentation (weaponry) and flammable material, including three unexploded IEDs. The National Investigation Agency doubted that the blasts were masterminded by Swami Aseemanand, which was dismissed later for lack of evidence.\n\nOn 1 July 2009, the US Department of Treasury designated Arif Qasmani of the Lashkar-e Tayyiba as a person involved in terrorism, citing among other things his involvement in the Samjhauta Express bombing.\n\nOn 30 December 2010, India's National Investigation Agency claimed that they had solid evidence that Swami Aseemanand was the mastermind behind the blasts. He had taken help from his friend Sandeep Dange, an engineering graduate \nand has done higher study in physics, and Ramji Kalsangra, an electrician, to build the improvised explosive devices used in the blasts. On 8 January 2011, Aseemanand allegedly confessed the bombing of Samjhauta express, a statement later found to be obtained under duress. Later the Hindu nationalist group RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) sent a legal notice to CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) accusing it of deliberately leaking Swami Aseemanand's confession in the media. RSS spokesman Ram Madhav called the investigation maligning of organizations and individuals.\n\nAccording to various local newspapers, NIA arrested Kamal Chauhan, who is deemed by the NIA as the main operative, in February 2012.\n"}
{"id": "2068786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068786", "title": "Tubao", "text": "Tubao\n\nTubao, La Union, officially the Municipality of Tubao, is a 4th class municipality in the province of La Union, Philippines. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 28,729 people.\n\nFormerly known as the \"Home of the Native Tobacco\", Tubao was famous for its tobacco leaf and cigars. It had a tobacco trade for decades where its town center was littered by huge tobacco warehouses and trading posts for tobacco. Today, corn is its prime agricultural output where Chichacorn is among its by-products.\n\nThe town has an average annual income of PHP 42,803,624 pesos.\n\n\"Legend states that Tubao got its name when the Spaniards led by one Father Luis Gonzaga y Espinosa, in their desire to spread Christianity, headed towards the eastern parts of Agoo. At that time, these parts of Agoo were hinterlands and heavily forested. While the Spaniards were resting under the full-grown trees, they distributed manuscripts of the \"cartilla\" and \"catecismo\" to the natives. Suddenly, they heard a loud chorus of sound \"TUAO, TUAO\", emanating from the top of the trees. These sounds made by the birds locally known as \"kalaw\", (the rufous hornbill, \"Buceros hydrocorax\") attracted and bewildered the Spaniards. Even as the Spaniards went further east, the sound persisted. When Father Espinosa returned from their journey, he reported an area called \"TUAO.\" However, due to inadvertent recordings made by the Spanish authorities, the word \"TUAO\" was written as \"TUBAO\", hence, the name of the place.\"\n\nAn inland land-locked town, Tubao is located in Region I lying along the south-eastern side of La Union province. It is bounded on the north by Aringay, on the east by Pugo, on the south-west by Santo Tomas, on the south by Rosario, and on the west by Agoo. It is now located about south of the capital city San Fernando, north of Manila, north of San Fernando, Pampanga (the regional city center in the Central Luzon) and west of Baguio City.\n\nRural topography is seventy percent (70%) alluvial plains and thirty percent (30%) uplands. Highest portion is located in Barangay Rizal, which is more than above sea level. Flat lands are found in the middle portion of the town, in between its southern and northern hilly sections.\n\n\nThe climate prevailing in the municipality is characterized by two distinct seasons, dry from November to April and wet during the rest of the year.\n\nAnnual main rainfall as recorded by PAGASA is 217.8 ml with a peak of 1,059.6 millimeters in December. The mean temperature is 27.5 Celsius. It rises to as high as 29.2 Celsius in May and goes down as low as 25 Celsius in January. Monthly average number of rainy days is 11.2, while relative humidity is 78.9.\n\nDirection of the wind blowing in the area is mostly from south-west to north-east due to south-west monsoons. The area has a natural shield of winds blowing from the east because of the Cordillera mountain ranges. During summer, in the absence of any weather disturbance, wind blows from west to east as natural sea breeze.\n\nSoil types are found as follows: San Manuel silt loam in Barangay Santa Teresa with an approximate area of 336 hectares; Umingan Clay loam in Poblacion and Anduyan; Barcelona Clay in Barangay Leones; Mountain soils, annam clay loam and Bauang clay in Santa Teresa, Halog, Gonzales, Anduyan, Linapew and Garcia.\n\nTubao is an interior town in the southern part of the province of La Union that surfaced in the mid-1880s. It was a barrio in the eastern boundaries of Agoo and Aringay. The place was a former \"visita\" of the parish of Agoo. During the Spanish period, a \"visita\" was a settlement with a church but was visited periodically by a non-resident clergy whose headquarters was at the mother town. The early settlers of the barrio called it San Isidro de Tubao in honor of its patron saint whose feast is celebrated every May 14 and 15 of the year.\n\nOn March 28, 1873, residents of this huge settlement composed of nine barrios from Agoo (Macoton, Amboot, Caoigue, Pideg, Damosil, Masalip, Linapew, Anduyan and Ambañgonan) together with six other barrios from Aringay] (Santa Theresa, Copang, Calopaan, Bugarin, Guinitaban and San Pascual) petitioned for the creation of a new municipality.\n\nPugo, then part of Tubao was called Rancheria Tulosa. It was in 1883 that quail (locally known as \"pugo\") hunters who frequented the place changed the name into Rancheria Pugo after the birds.\nHowever, it was not until July 20, 1885 when a \"superior decreto\" embodied in the \"expediente\" of August 28, 1885 created the new town of Tubao. On August 21, 1885, La Union Spanish Military Governor Federico Francia proposed a review of the petition to redefine the border limits of Aringay.\n\nOn November 10, 1885, \"real orden\" No. 901 affirmed the July 20th \"superior decreto\". On November 16, 1885, Francia acknowledged the existence of the \"\"nuevo pueblo de Tubao\"\" from the barrios that were yielded by Agoo and Aringay. Hence, Tubao became the 14th town of La Union. Four months later, on March 8, 1886, Governor Federico Francia inaugurated the town.\n\nTubao Mayor Dante Garcia survived an assassination attack when he escaped unscathed from an ambush early on September 9, 2012, along the Aspiras National Highway in Barangay Lloren, Tubao. But Attorney Lazaro Gayo, a former vice mayor of the town and an aspiring candidate for Sangguniang Panlalawigan was murdered.\n\nThe Civil Society Group (CSG) and the La Union police therefore held a rally at Freedom Park in Agoo to protest the series of unsolved extrajudicial killings in Tubao and Agoo. The public indignation was led by Reverend Mariano C. Apilado of Peace Builders La Union, Melvin Macusi of Amnesty International, Danilo Balino from the Commission on Human Rights and Fr. Leo Nedic of TIGNAY-PPCRV, other human rights Groups, Kanlungan, Bannuar and leaders of the Catholic and Protestant Churches.\n\n\n\nIn the , the population of Tubao was people, with a density of .\n\nJust as the national government, the municipal government of Tubao, is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judiciary. The judicial branch is administered solely by the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The LGUs have control of the executive and legislative branch.\n\nThe executive branch is composed of the mayor and the barangay captain for the barangays.\n\nThe legislative branch is composed of the Sangguniang Bayan (town assembly), Sangguniang Barangay (barangay council), and the Sangguniang Kabataan for the youth sector.\n\nThe seat of Government is vested upon the Mayor and other elected officers who hold office at the Tubao Town hall. The Sanguniang Bayan is the center of legislation, stationed in Tubao Municipio.\n\nFor 378 years, from 1521 to 1899, Local Chief Executives of the \"“pueblos”\" or towns were appointed by the Spaniards and in the year 1901 up to 1910 they were appointed by the Americans. Afterwards, election was the mode of selection.\n\nEarly local government was covered by the Maura Law which was passed in 1893 that changed the title or designation of town heads from gobernadorcillo to capitan municipal. It was ruled by the members of the Tribunal Municipal, the \"cabezas de barangay\" and the \"principales\" (the local oligarchy as delegates), who elect the members of the Tribunal Council.\n\nThe following local officials held the positions either as Tenientes Absolute Gobernadorcillos, Capitanes, Presidentes Municipal and Municipal Mayors, for the terms opposite their respective names:\n\nDuring the Spanish period until the 20th century, religion (Roman Catholicism) played a major role in the life of the people of Tubao. Tubao was a \"visita\" of the Parish of Agoo. A chapel and a convento of light materials were erected in 1884. Ten years later, the parish of Tubao was founded. Its first pastor, Father Juan Garcia arrived only after two years, in the month of March 1896. The cause of the delay was the subsidy to be voted upon in the Cortes Generales of Madrid. The missionary started gathering materials for a new church and a convento but could not carry out his plan as he left already in January 1898; it would take more than 30 years before these projects would materialized.\n\nOn March 8, 1900, during the tense period of the Philippine–American War, the people of Tubao petitioned against the return of the friars.\n\nUp to 1912, the condition of the young parish was unstable and precarious. The priests did not stay long and several times, Tubao was without a spiritual father. In 1908, it became again a \"visita\", but of Aringay this time.\n\nConditions were better in Pugo. Although smaller and never given a pastor in the Spanish time, it had a Dutch-born resident priest since 1909, Rev. Gerard Martens. When Tubao lost its priest once more in 1911, the pious Christians sent a petition to the bishop requesting his excellency to send a missionary of the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (Congregatio Immaculati Cordis Mariae) in case no Filipino priest should be available. They had to be patient for a few months. About 20 November 1911, Father Morice Vanoverbergh arrived from Bauko, a CICM sister mission of Bontoc. His stay was short. About 8 February 1912, he learned that Father Jules Sepulchre, one of the founders of the mission in Bontoc and Bauko became ill upon his return to Bauko. Father Vanoverbergh went on horseback to visit him climbing the Santo Tomas mountain and arrived in Bauko on 14 February just in time for the burial. Father Jules Sepulchre died in Bontoc Hospital the day before. Father Vanoverbergh was asked by his superior to take over that mission. After two months, Father Martens was transferred to Tubao and stayed for eighteen years.\n\nDuring his stint, Father Martens extended the boundaries of the church yard and constructed the main part of the church. He built and rebuilt in 1916 the chapel in barangay Santa Teresa and gave a school chapel to Caoigue in 1917 and an ermita to Anduyan in 1926. He acquired the rectory which was put up in Spanish time. He also started a primary school in Anduyan and Caoigue in 1913. In June 1915, he opened a Grade I class on the ground floor of the rectory or convent to be later named Tubao Catholic School and conducted a parish census. A Belgian missionary from the same congregation (Congregatio Immaculati Cordis Mariae) Rev.Father Charles Beurms, assisted Father Martens and became the first director of the school. Father Martens also founded \"The Apostleship of Prayer\" (1912) and \"\"Los Defensores de la Libertad\"\" which later became the \"\"Cabsat ni San Isidro.\"\"\nIn 1922, the first group of Belgian missionary sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (Immaculati Cordis Mariae) arrived headed by Mother Marie Andrea and followed by Mother Marie Ambroise in 1923. The latter became the first principal for the Tubao Catholic high school with the opening of the First Year class. In 1924, the Second Year class was added.\n\nThe lot on which the church building and the convent of the Sisters were built on was bought from Doña Laureana Novicio de Luna, mother of the famous Luna brothers -- Juan Luna and Antonio Luna.\n\nIn was in 1923 when the priests acquired the house of Don Urbano Dacanay for P1,000 pesos, west of the plaza, and housed in it the newly founded Tubao Catholic High School. It was named the Msgr. Martens Building. This building was destroyed in World War II during the liberation from the Japanese occupation. In January 1951, Father Albert Van Nuffelen sold the lot back for P1,800 pesos to the relatives of the former owner viz., Mr. Bernardino Madriaga and Milagrina Oller who built their house on it.\n\nFrom 1930 to 1933, during Father Alois Proost's term, the church sanctuary and sacristies were completed. He donated the big church bells. He organized a scout band, a string band and the first and best girl scout unit in the Philippines. He also added Third and Fourth year classes in the Tubao Catholic High School established by Father Martens before. A primary school was also opened in Pideg (1931) and Amallapay (1933?).\n\nFrom 1934 to 1935, Father Morice Van Overbergh installed the tiled floors on the church. He was a scholar and did outstanding work in botany, anthropology and linguistics.\n\nThe parish priests expanded the church yard and bought more lots in the 1920s up to the 1950s. In 1927, a land was bought from Baltazar Dulay for P200 pesos, north of the church. A few years later, the sacristy was built on this property. Another lot, west of the sacristy, was bought from Don Francisco Zandueta (La Union Governor from 1910–1912) and was partly occupied by a bamboo warehouse for storing tobacco rented by Chan Chin Ko Baltazar, father of Florencio Chan Baltazar who later became municipal mayor. The warehouse was converted into three classrooms for boys of the intermediate class. In 1940, Father Carlos Desmet procured the means to have a new school building within the premises to replace the old bamboo shack. It was the Sancho Building named after Msgr. Sancho, the bishop of Nueva Segovia who helped with the means. Again, this building was razed to the ground during the war. Today the area is an open field of the school.\n\nMore lots were acquired from Doña Maxima Zarate in October 1950 by Father Albert Van Nuffelen where the present high school building now stands; Alfredo Milanes, Felix Garcia, Teodoro Ramos, Timoteo Ramos for the lots at the eastern side of the church in 1951. The northern section of the school garden was bought from Valeriano Mapalo by Father Jose de Hayes in 1957.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1944, classes were suspended.In as much as the bombs destroyed the old Martens and Sancho buildings, primary classes were sought in the house of Benedicto Verceles, southeast of the rectory or convent while intermediate and high school classes were held in the convent. \n\nFather Albert Van Nuffelen, parish priest from 1949-1954 constructed two new buildings and named these the new Martens and Sancho buildings, south and north of the present basketball court which he also built.\n\nIn 1954, Father Jose de Hayes became parish priest and school director. He proposed the school to have a Christian name. In 1956, Tubao Catholic School was renamed San Alberto Magno Academy (SAMA) in honor of Saint Albert the Great and his predecessor, Father Albert Van Nuffelen.\n\nIn 1963, Father Henry Geeroms initiated and sought means to construct another building which was located at the back of the Sancho building to house a library, a laboratory and four classrooms.\nToday, that building has been demolished and a new building now has been constructed in its place.\n\nDuring the Golden Jubilee in 1965, the school populace was 1,393 including the 115 pupils of Caoigue. But enrollment gradually dwindled due to the opening of free public schools in the different barangays. Elementary classes were phased out in 1973 due to financial constraint.\n\nIn 1966, Father Jaime Quatannens, organize the credit union/cooperative to find an alternative lending facility other than those provided by unscrupulous moneylenders. On August 13, 1966, with 39 pioneer-members and a starting paid-up capitalization of Three hundred fourteen pesos (P 314.00), the Tubao Credit Union, Inc. as originally named was formally organized and registered with the Cooperative Administration Office (CAO) under RA 2023 and approved on October 26, 1966 under Registration No. 001503.\n\nAfter 68 years, the Belgian CICM and ICM sisters handed the school administration in 1984 to the Diocese of San Fernando, La Union and the last ICM principal was Sister Cleofe Bacon who left in 1998.\n\nThe Sancho building was damaged by the July 16, 1990 earthquake and was renovated. Only the first floor remains of the original building built by Father Van Nuffelen. The Martens building now houses the Saint Isidore School for grade school classes which was revived in the late 1990s.\n\nAs of 2012, the St. Isidore the Farmer Parish Church of Tubao (canonically erected in 1896), 2509 La Union, celebrates its fiesta every May 15. It is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Fernando de La Union (Dioecesis Ferdinandopolitana ab Unione, Suffragan of Lingayen – Dagupan, which was created on January 19, 1970 and erected on April 11, 1970, comprising the Civil Province of La Union, under the Titular, St. William the Hermit, February 10). The Church is underf a diocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines from the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia.\n\nThe Tubao Church is under the Vicariate of St. Francis Xavier with Vicar Forane, Fr. Joel Angelo Licos.\n\nThe Church was rehabilitated and renovated in 1980 under Jose D. Aspiras.\n\nOn December 30, 1996, Fr. Noel C. Mabutas, Parish Priest and Mr. Jose C. Taveres, Parish Council President signed the Centennial Marker in the Church Door, under the lead of Archbishops Oscar V. Cruz, Antonio R. Tobias, D.D. and Antonio Ll. Mabutas, D.D. with the Centennial Executive Board.\n\nThe 1954 Our Lady of Lourdes Grotto (built by Fr. Albert Van Nuffelen, CICM, on 1954) was enthroned with Marker on February 11, 2005 by Rev. Camilo P. Villanueva, Parish Priest.\n\nOn December 30, 2006, 110th Anniversary of the Church the Trailblazer Memorial honoring the Centennial Celebration of the CICM - RP 1911-1982, 7 Decades, was erected on the Church door, and blessed by Bishop Antonio Rillera, S.V.D., D.D.\n\n"}

{"id": "2068792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068792", "title": "Dinah Marler", "text": "Dinah Marler\n\nDinah Marler is a fictional character from the CBS Daytime soap opera \"Guiding Light\", last portrayed by Gina Tognoni from July 6, 2004 to September 18, 2009.\n\nThe character was originated by Jennifer Gatti from June 1986 to June 1987. Paige Turco assumed the role in July 1987 and played Dinah until February 1989. Wendy Moniz next portrayed the character from early February 1995 to March 1999. In May 2004, it was announced that former \"One Life to Live\" actress Gina Tognoni would step into the role of Dinah. She debuted in the role in July 2004. Following the cancellation of \"Guiding Light\", Tognoni opted out of her contract early.\n\nTognoni has won two Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for the role in 2006 and 2008, and was also nominated in 2007.\n\nVanessa gave birth to Dinah at the age of seventeen in 1970 and felt she was incapable of being a good mother to her newborn at the time. With no one to turn to for help, she gave Dinah up for adoption and was reassured that her child would be adopted by a great family who would love and care for her. Dinah would have to endure a turbulent childhood and when she was reunited with her biological parents in her teenage years, the hurt and resentment she felt towards Ross and Vanessa for giving her up as a baby made it hard to forgive them. Vanessa especially received the brunt of Dinah's wrath when she learnt her mother had placed her for adoption without Ross even knowing about her existence.\n\nAfter her initial adoptive parents (John and Melissa Carter) were killed in a car accident, her adoptive uncle, the late Gordon Matthews (Melissa's brother) placed her at the Little Angels Foundling Home in Springfield. In time, she would be placed with a foster family the Morgans who also took in another girl, Adele, whom Dinah became very close to. She ran away from the Morgans and found a new foster family, the Kowalskis, that worked at a carnival, but 1986, Dinah was tired of the carnival life and left for Springfield to find her long lost foster sister, Adele.\n\nEventually, Adele (now known as Dorie Smith) and Dinah would be reunited thanks to Phillip Spaulding's help. Dorie would go on to be adopted by India von Halkein and Dinah moved into the von Halkein residence as well.\n\nThough still resentful of him, she accepted Ross faster than Vanessa and moved in with her father eventually. Although she could hardly be civil to her mother. On the romantic front, Dinah became involved with Cameron Stewart who would break her heart when he had an affair with Lacey Bauer (Johnny's younger sister) on the side. Hurt, she turned to Alan-Michael Spaulding. Her relationship with her mother was further strained when Vanessa discovered her teenage daughter was socialising with alcoholics at wild parties thanks to her new boyfriend's influence.\n\nWhilst on a motorcycle tour with Alan-Michael one night, her boyfriend accidentally collided with Frank Cooper's car. Frank was on his way to the hospital so his pregnant kid sister, Harley Cooper, could give birth. With no way to get to Cedars on time, Dinah delivered Harley's newborn whom the latter would name Daisy. Dinah and Harley became fast friends and the former would be there for emotional support when Harley gave Daisy up for adoption.\n\nMeanwhile, Ross and Vanessa had reunited and although Dinah was happy about that, her parents ended up separating again. Later, when Vanessa was about to leave for Venezuela, Dinah and Ross said their goodbyes and mother and daughter finally reunited. In 1988, Dinah suspected George and his criminal partner, Nicky Sutton of smuggling drugs in cars through Frank's garage. Although she tried to tell Cam, he refused to believe her and pushed her away. As for Cam, he made up with his father but, one day, he witnessed George with Nicky at Spaulding Enterprises and finally realized that George had not changed as he claimed. One day, when Dinah was alone in the Stewart house with George, she tried to get George to leave Cam alone. George getting angry with Dinah and nearly acting on his sexual obsession with the under aged Dinah came after her and nearly raped her. Fortunately Cam was visiting Ross, and Cam realized that Dinah was at his house with his father and not at Ross's as Dinah had led to believe. Cam and Ross raced over to the Stewart house and got George to stop before Dinah was raped. Springfield P.D. Lt. Larry Wyatt tried to get Cam and Dinah to see that it was not wise for them to set up George, but both of the teens refused to listen, but Lt. Wyatt got Cam and Dinah to agree to let him be nearby when George was arrested. On the day Rusty was arresting Nicky, George ran from Nicky and back home with the last drug buy that George was going to make from the man. Cam and Dinah on a tip from Rose McClaren came home with Lt. Wyatt waiting right outside and when George came home he first started abusing both Cam and Dinah until the bag of coke he bought from Nicky came falling out of his pocket onto the kitchen floor. Lt. Wyatt came in and arrested George right on the spot. Meanwhile, Alan-Michael had enough of Dinah being involved with Cam's personal problems and he and Dinah broke up. So Dinah and Cam were free and got involved again. Not long after, Dinah and Cam were surprised to learn of Alan-Michael and Harley's engagement. In February 1989 Dinah departed Springfield to go to college in Paris and Cameron followed her.\n\nDinah returned to Springfield in 1995 a changed woman. No longer the sweet young teenager, this Dinah was sophisticated and spoiled from living in Europe. Although Ross and Vanessa thought she was on break from school, they were shocked to discover that she had dropped out. While Dinah tried to pass herself off as a wealthy debutant, Ross's new wife, Blake, and Henry suspected that Dinah was in fact broke. While staying at Vanessa's, Dinah alienated herself from Vanessa's fiancé, Matt Reardon, by flirting with him. Days later, Dinah was shocked when she came across an old acquaintance named Viktor Pasternak. As Dinah was telling Viktor about her money problems, she mentioned that her grandfather has a huge trust fund, but she will not receive a penny of it until she is married. However, Viktor had a plan. That same day, Vanessa learned of Dinah's money woes and since Dinah's flirtatious ways were grating on Matt, she suggested that Dinah live with Ross and Blake. Although Blake was not happy about the situation, she caved in and let Dinah move into the carriage house. However, like Matt, Blake did not totally trust Dinah either and decided to find out what her new stepdaughter was up to. For Blake her plan was not totally successful; not only could not she make out who Dinah was speaking with, while she listened in on her, but Dinah caught on and starting speaking in code with Viktor. As Dinah continued to annoy Blake with her smoking and general selfishness, she had her parents, especially Ross, were wrapped around her little finger. Meanwhile, Dinah had found a perfect way to get money—she had arranged for Viktor to kidnap her and they would split the ransom money. For Dinah, Viktor double crossed her and left her tied up while he decided to ask for more money (which he would keep for himself. The family received Viktor's ransom demand and Matt convinced everyone that he had taken the money to the location Viktor had mentioned. Knowing that Dinah's life was in danger. When Matt left the briefcase at the specified location near the railroad tracks for Viktor, instead of going back home, he instinctively went to the abandoned underground factory and found Dinah there tied up and gagged. He immediately released her gag, while Viktor found the money and headed back to the abandoned factory. Viktor arrived just as Matt was almost done untying the rope around Dinah's hands. Viktor got away but was later caught when trying to fly out of Springfield. Ross and Vanessa were extremely disappointed in their daughter for her behavior and her scheming ways.\n\nAngry at her parents, Dinah lashed out by sleeping with the town villain, Roger Thorpe, Blake's father. In an effort to get Roger away from their daughter, Ross and Vanessa used Roger's visitation rights for Peter (since he was Peter's grandfather) as a weapon. Livid at their using Peter, Roger vowed to find his son, Hart, and tell him about Peter (since he had no idea he fathered a child) and then use him to get custody of Peter. Roger eventually found Hart and when strain in Roger's marriage to Dinah emerged, Hart got Dinah to sleep with him and then gleefully revealed the fact to his enraged dad. Little did anyone realize that Roger had been busy embezzling all of Dinah's trust fund money. While trying to patch things up with Dinah, his lawyer and confidante, former DA Leo Flynn, was \"doctoring\" his financial books to make it look like Roger had lost the money in a bad investment, it was actually stashed away in the Cayman Islands. When he was about to have to go to court to reveal what he had done with the money, Roger took some pills and faked a heart attack to dodge court. His ploy nearly worked; Dinah almost fell back into Roger's grasp, but Hart learned that his father had stolen Dinah's money and showed Dinah the proof. Already angry with Roger for his thievery, Dinah got worse when she was told Roger had faked his heart attack. She bought a gun and went into Roger's hospital room with the intention of killing him. Luckily, Hart dragged her off before she pulled the trigger.\n\nThe two concocted a plan to make Roger believe he was losing his mind. Dinah decided not to divorce Roger and then she and Hart did all kinds of things to make Roger question his mental faculties. Roger did not realize what was happening because he thought Dinah and Hart hated each other and that she was an airhead. For him, Dinah and Hart began to fall in love. It was a slow process, but it drove Roger mad and violent. He attacked Hart several times, choked Dinah with a scarf, began drugging Dinah and tried to convince her to kill herself while on it. Hart eventually caught on to his father's malevolent plot and saved Dinah. Now, they both decided to kick their plan into high gear. Hart confronted Roger at Laurel Falls with a vial of the drugs and threatened to the police Roger had been trying to drive his wife insane in an effort to cover up the fact he robbed her blind ever since he had married her. A fearful Roger pulled a gun on Hart and the two struggled. The gun went off and Hart was shot. A despondent Roger, believing he had \"murdered\" his own son, buried Hart. However, this was merely part of the clever plot against him; Hart was not dead, the bullet had been a blank and he had been wearing a blood pack. Roger's mental state dramatically declined and got worse after he accidentally drank an entire vial of the drugs he had been poisoning Dinah with. The drug was pumped out of his system, but he was left strapped down to a hospital bed after he had tried to strangle Dinah. Finally, at a fair, Hart revealed himself to Roger in front of the entire town. A whacked-out Roger could not believe his eyes and admitted to everyone that he had shot Hart. Suddenly after Dinah refused to corroborate Roger's story, he realized he had been set up all along and attacked his son. It took two cops to subdue him and Roger was eventually sent to a mental institution. After learning Dinah had retrieved her money from the Cayman Islands, Roger set out to escape the mental hospital and prove he had been set up. After escaping, he then disguised himself and broke into Hart's apartment and found a picture of Hart and Dinah together in the Caymans, disproving their claim they hated each other and validating his argument they had been in collusion all along. Bridget Reardon (fearing that Hart, the father of her child, might go to jail) switched photos and when Roger showed it to the judge, it was really a picture of Peter. Roger was carted back off to the loony bin. After a failed escape attempt, Dinah authorized the psychiatrists to give Roger \"shock treatment\" to cure him of violent impulses. At a second competency hearing, Hart and Dinah were discovered together and a \"kind, benevolent\" Roger, he had never undergone the shock therapy and was pretending, was finally released from the mental hospital.\n\nDinah got a surprise visit from her old lover from France, Jean-Luc. Jean Luc and Dinah had lived together for two years and he told Hart that he regretted kicking her out and wanted her back. Dinah told him that she would handle him. She told Jean Luc that she was still mad at him for throwing her out and that they were together a long time ago. She was a different person now. Upon learning that Hart and Dinah were engaged, Jean Luc jokingly inquired how many fiancées this makes for Dinah and told Hart that love did not last with Dinah no matter whom she was with. Although Dinah and Hart thought Jean Luc's appearance in Springfield was innocent, he was actually paid by Roger to break up the couple. To succeed in his goal, Jean Luc visited Dinah again and pledged his love for her. When she rejected him by pointing out that he had been interested in her only for her money, and that he had dumped her previously, Jean Luc merely reminisced about the good days with her. Jean Luc pointed out that she would eventually tire of the farm and that a girl like her could never make a man like Hart happy for long. However, things between Dinah and Hart would get worse without Jean Luc's help. It soon became obvious that Dinah was insecure of her role in Hart's life and was not quite the type of woman to stay on the farm. Things got tenser after a trip to Switzerland, where Jean Luc arranged for Dinah to be reunited by her jet-setting friends.\n\nAlthough Dinah was enjoying herself, it was apparent that Hart was not and he was further dismayed when her friends followed her to Springfield. Not understanding how Dinah could have such shallow friends, Hart confided his frustrations to Bridget, which only fueled Dinah's jealousy. Finally, fearing she was about to lose Hart, Dinah agreed to tell her friends that they had to leave. Believing Jean Luc's words that Hart was trying to turn her into a domestic type, Dinah made a turnaround and refused to tell her friends to leave. Although she and Hart tried to settle their differences, she kept finding herself drawn to the jet-setting life and finally the couple decided they were incompatible and broke up in 1997. Her mother had mysteriously died but was later found alive and well; she had been battling an illness and when told that passing on the illness was a possibility, Dinah began to have second thoughts about having children with Hart, whom she had eventually reunited with, something that did not please him. When Dinah continued to have doubts about having children, despite Hart's having learned from Vanessa's doctor that the possibility was slight, it became apparent that perhaps Dinah just did not want to have children. Although she later agreed to \"let nature take its course\", Dinah secretly began taking birth control pills.\n\nIn the meantime, Dinah was becoming increasingly jealous of Hart's new friend--Cassie Layne, an ex-stripper who was trying to raise money to get her daughter out of foster care. Dinah eventually lost Hart, due to her meddling in Cassie's quest to get her daughter back. Dinah started obsessing with finding a way to win him back, alienating herself from her family. Knowing that Hart could not resist the maternal-type, Dinah borrowed a baby and set it up so Hart would see her caring for a child. Her plan worked with Hart believing that Dinah had changed and they reconciled. Later, Dinah was devastated when Hart broke their engagement saying that he no longer loved her. Making matters worse was the fact that Vanessa sympathized with Cassie and told Dinah that she needed to move on with her life. Afterwards, Dinah decided to focus her energies on getting Hart back. Having found Cassie's ex-husband, Rob, at a halfway house in Chicago, Dinah asked him to come to Springfield to help break-up Cassie and Hart. Dinah further enticed him with the concept that she had help him get custody of Tammy, Cassie's daughter. When her plans did not work, she accused Cassie of having an affair with Josh. At the same time, Dinah became convinced that Cassie was keeping a secret, along with Vanessa's doctor, Michael Burke, and decided to find out what exactly Cassie was up to. Dinah broke into Michael's apartment to see what she could find. While she could not find anything, it was apparent that Cassie was keeping a secret from Hart and that was damaging their relationship.\n\nOne day, a drunken Hart showed up at Dinah's doorstep and she took advantage of the situation by telling him later that they had made love. Later, she then slept with Rob so that she would become pregnant. The plan worked and Dinah told Hart that she was pregnant with his child. Marcus, a friend, who figured out what Dinah had done, tried to convince her to do the right thing; she was obsessed with getting Hart back and went along with the lie. After having a slight scare, Dinah lied to Hart that she was having a troubled pregnancy. Pleased when Hart vowed to stay by Dinah during her pregnancy, ultimately Cassie would not leave Hart. Wanting to put a cramp in their relationship, Dinah gave Hart an ultimatum, either her and the baby or Cassie. Cassie soon learned of Dinah and Rob's tryst. Dinah later was able to bribe the doctor to convince Hart that a test was too dangerous. Tragically, days after learning that Cassie herself was pregnant, Dinah miscarried: while sneaking around by the farm, she was accidentally hit by a door by Hart, who wanted to see who was trespassing. She then used his guilt as well as her mother's blood pressure pills to con him into staying with her. Later, when she became ill from over-medicating herself, she conned Hart into marrying her by claiming to be dying. Although the plan worked, Hart was still drawn to Cassie, who had decided to lie to Hart by claiming the child she was carrying was not his. Determined to keep Hart with her, Dinah set fire to the farm. The fire left Dinah with terrible scars on her face, which made Hart feel more responsible to her. However, Hart was shocked when he overheard Dinah and Vanessa talking and discovered that he was the father of Cassie's baby. Though Dinah tried to convince him that she kept the truth from him because she loved him and wanted him to stay, he did not buy it and left her. Although Vanessa again implored Dinah to get professional help, Dinah insisted that all she needed was Hart. Thinking her sister was picking her up, Cassie got into the car only to find Dinah behind the wheel. Dinah then locked the doors and drove into a snowstorm, ranting about how Cassie's ruined her life. Worked up Dinah, skidded into a snow bank and the car got stuck. Just then, Cassie started to go into labor but Dinah did not believe her. Frantic, Cassie called Hart on his cell phone and he headed into the storm to find her. Angry, Dinah moved off telling Cassie to let Hart save her. However, Dinah returned to the car, realized that Cassie was serious and the baby may not make it without her help. So, Dinah acted and delivered the baby. Just then Hart arrived, thrilled and relieved to find Cassie and see his son for the first time.\n\nTotally unbalanced by now, Dinah got angry with Hart for rejecting her and retaliated by breaking into his room at the Springfield Inn. Desperate to hold on to Hart, Dinah finally revealed the lengths she had gone to keep him – taking Vanessa's pills, which almost killed her, and starting the fire that scarred her. Shocked, Hart called Vanessa, telling her to get her daughter. That day, Dinah freaked out when Vanessa mentioned having her committed, and she called her father to come help her. Dinah then moved in with her father, Ross. However, although she was able to fool him into thinking she was alright, it was clear that Hart was not out of her system. Then Cassie learned the truth about the child Dinah miscarried, and knowing that that was her only link to Hart, Dinah tried to appeal to Cassie. When that did not work, she grabbed the one antique gun Hart left behind. Dinah aimed the antique gun at Cassie, who plead with Dinah to realize that Hart would find out Laura was not his baby one way or another. At that moment, Hart walked in and jumped in front of Cassie as Dinah pulled the trigger. He was critically wounded, and as a devastated Dinah fled to her mother for help, Cassie had Hart rushed to the hospital. Vanessa was devastated by what her daughter did and wanted Dinah to explain the accidental shooting to the police but Dinah insisted that she would kill herself first, and Vanessa decided to hide her. Before leaving, a desperate Dinah went to Cedars to see Hart. As he was going into cardiac arrest, Dinah confronted him and shook him in her attempt to convince him that the shooting was accidental. As machines started to go off, Dinah debated whether to stay with Hart or save herself. She wound up fleeing as doctors arrived to revive Hart and ran smack into Matt in the hospital parking garage. Matt grabbed Dinah and planned to turn her in, but backed down when Dinah revealed that her mother would never forgive him. Days later, Vanessa arranged for Dinah to fly to Switzerland where the nuns who took care of her during her illness would help Dinah disappear. After mother and daughter shared a heartfelt good-bye, Dinah fled Springfield. There would be no word about Dinah until the summer of 2000 when she contacted her mother saying that she needed help: she was pregnant. Dinah was mentioned in June 2002 when Ross saw Vanessa at Josh and Reva Lewis's wedding. Curiously there was no mention of her having had a baby.\n\nThe truth about what Dinah had been doing would come to light in the summer of 2004 when Cassie Layne discovered that a mysterious woman, in Europe, was using her credit cards. The mystery became even more intriguing when she realized the woman was posing as Princess Cassandra Winslow, herself. Not long after, Jeffrey O'Neill, the Springfield D.A., tracked Dinah down in Europe and warned her that if she did not stop impersonating Cassie, he would prosecute her. Far from being concerned, Dinah instead flirted with Jeffrey, bringing to mind when they met two years ago—when he rescued Dinah (who had miscarried her baby) who was languishing in a European prison. But Jeffrey's rescue had a price—in exchange she had to help him, by impersonating her old rival Cassie, who to Dinah's utter shock, was now married to an actual Prince, Richard Winslow, a dead-ringer for Jeffrey. Cassie was eventually widowed and living in Springfield, where Jeffrey now lived as well. Although Jeffrey thought that he had scared Dinah, but she continued masquerading as the Princess. After Cassie almost caught her, Dinah decided to go back to Springfield, in disguise since she was still wanted for Hart's murder. In Springfield, Dinah contacted Ross, who urged Dinah to turn herself in, which she did. Soon Dinah made her way to the Jessup farm where she came face to face with Hart's son, R.J. Introducing herself as his imaginary friend, she convinced the boy to keep her existence a secret. In the meantime, Dinah offered Edmund a deal to work together and ensure that Jeffrey never got too close to Cassie. Dinah admitted she had her sights set on Jeffrey and against his better judgment, Edmund created an alliance with her. Later, Dinah secretly called Jeffrey to convince him she was still safe and sound in Europe. However, when he learned that a mysterious person was stalking Cassie, even trying to kill her. Jeffrey continued to hunt for Dinah, finally finding her in Bill's apartment. He tried to threaten her into leaving town, again but she broke down his defenses and the pair almost wound up making love. Soon after, Dinah began actively stalking Cassie. Yet, Jeffrey kept quiet, instead trying to handle Dinah himself and urging her to give up her obsessive vendetta against Cassie. Deciding to get rid of Dinah once and for all, Jeffrey put her on a plane to Europe under guard, however, Dinah bribed a lookalike to take her place while she stayed in Springfield. Things finally came to a head one stormy night at the Jessup farm. Upon arriving at the barn, Dinah spotted Edmund knocking Jeffrey out with a shovel. The blow caused Jeffrey, who was holding a candle to fall, and the barn went up in flames. Edmund was able to drag Jeffrey to safety, while unbeknownst to them, Cassie entered the burning barn and spotted RJ trapped at the top level. Cassie became trapped under falling debris, but Dinah saved the day by rescuing RJ and alerting Edmund and Jeffrey to Cassie. Dinah was finally caught and sent to jail for Hart's death. The key witness was Cassie. As the sole witness to the shooting, if Cassie stated that Dinah was not in sound mind during the shooting—then Dinah would go free. Hoping to facilitate her release, Dinah tried to convince both Cassie and Blake that she was truly remorseful about Hart's death. Although Blake remained convinced that Dinah should stay behind bars, Cassie decided it was not worth the emotional rigors and stated that Hart's shooting was an accident. Dinah was a free woman.\n\nDinah, despite being warned to forget about Cassie and go on with her life, decided to take from Cassie what was taken from her. So, deciding to steal Edmund away from Cassie, Dinah set it up so he would spot her drunkenly attempting to strip in a bar. Trying to avoid her making a scene, Edmund found her and dragged her out. Confronted by Edmund, Dinah turned on the tears and bemoaned to Edmund that she did not know how to change. As she had hoped, Edmund softened toward her and let her spend the night in his hotel suite. Meanwhile, Dinah continued to fuel Edmund's jealousy of Jeffrey by setting it up so he would see a picture of Jeffrey (as Richard) with Cassie in Jeffrey's apartment. Dinah gained the trust of Cassie's daughter, Tammy. She then gave Tammy her car keys and suggested that she go away to think. With Tammy gone, Dinah decided to play with Cassie's head and, disguising her voice, informed Cassie that Tammy was trying to get a job as a stripper in Chicago. She then informed Jeffrey that she told Tammy to go to Chicago, setting it up so the two could leave together. Although the pair failed to find Tammy, Dinah's machinations further drove a wedge between Cassie and Edmund because Cassie continually relied on Edmund.\n\nDinah seduced Jeffrey. However, Jeffrey discovered her true motive for the seduction when he discovered that she had poked holes in his condom. Realizing this was all about getting pregnant so she could have a life like Cassie's, Jeffrey blasted Dinah and threw her out. Although Dinah initially taunted him by implying that she was pregnant. Although she was sure of a positive pregnancy, Dinah was later devastated to learn that she was not. By the end of the year, Dinah was more jealous than ever of Cassie's impending marriage to Edmund and sought to destroy it by suggesting to R.J. that he saw Edmund hit Jeffrey over the head the night of the fire. That night, RJ told Jeffrey, who went to Dinah for confirmation. Dinah confirmed what she had seen and then encouraged Jeffrey to tell Cassie what he had learned.\n\nIn 2005, Dinah was pleasantly surprised to see Cassie's trouble-making nephew Jonathan Randall head up to Cassie's room at the Beacon. Figuring that Cassie was setting Jonathan up (so his mother would see him taking advantage of an \"inebriated\" Cassie), Dinah put a wrench in her plans by first hanging a Do Not Disturb sign outside Cassie's door and then kept Reva from going up to Cassie's room with a story about calling Edmund to the hotel. The next morning, the day of Cassie and Edmund's wedding, Dinah summoned Edmund to the hotel. By the time Edmund got to Cassie's room, Jonathan had slipped out. However, thanks to Jonathan's drugging of Cassie and implying that they had slept together, a shaken Cassie almost did not attend her own wedding. In the meantime, Dinah distressed Bill by admitting to him that she was in love with Edmund. After learning that Edmund and Cassie did marry, a devious Dinah revealed to Edmund that she knew the reason why Cassie nearly did not make it to the altar. Although she was just teasing him with the information, without giving him any, Edmund was intrigued. Meanwhile, Dinah was pleased when Blake informed her that she had dropped the restraining order against her, out of gratitude for not ruining Cassie's wedding day. However, Dinah was still intent on breaking up the happy couple and decided to help fuel Edmund's growing jealousy by anonymously sending Cassie flowers.\n\nBill was still concerned about Dinah's obsession over Edmund and his wife. Knowing that Cassie and Edmund were trying to get pregnant, it did not take long for Dinah to start pumping Corey, an OB-GYN who was a blind date, for information on modern fertility methods. Though Dinah tried to get her hands on some fertility drugs, she ended up being caught by Corey. Later, Dinah piqued Jonathan's interest when she told him about the fire in the barn. Eventually, Cassie figured out that Dinah knew what happened the night before her wedding and after a confrontation, the two got into a catfight that was broken up by Ross. Days later, after being accused of setting a small fire to the barn (Jonathan had done it), Dinah finally told Edmund what she knew about Jonathan and Cassie. Angry beyond belief, Edmund raced off to confront Jonathan while Dinah went and told Cassie what Edmund knew. Although Cassie came face to face with Edmund's violent side when she saw him beating up Jonathan, she still stayed loyal to him. At the same time, in celebration of what they thought would be the end of Cassie and Edmund's marriage, Dinah and Jonathan became lovers. They then hatched another plan to destroy the Winslow marriage by telling Cassie's sister, Reva, about Edmund causing the fire, hoping Reva would tell Cassie. Very soon after, Ross, Blake, Bill, and a visiting Matt staged an intervention to convince Dinah to leave town. That only succeeded in alienating Dinah from everyone when she became convinced that their motivation was to protect Cassie. Days later, the Winslow family was dealt a devastating blow when Cassie finally learned that Edmund had been responsible for the barn fire.\n\nWith Edmund vulnerable, Dinah convinced him to let her carry his and Cassie's embryo (which had been frozen and was ready for implementation), convincing him that it would help him get Cassie back. Although he was skeptical of her motives, despite her insistence that she was trying to redeem herself, when Edmund learned that Cassie was leaving him, he desperately agreed to the plan. To cover himself legally, Edmund had Dinah sign a contract stating that she would voluntarily give up the child at birth. He then invited Dinah to stay at the farm so he could take care of her. Although Dinah tried to get closer to Edmund by offering him tips on how to win back Cassie, all her efforts only reminded her of the sacrifice she was making. Dinah finally informed Cassie that she was pregnant with her and Edmund's baby. Although sickened with the revelation that her hated rival was pregnant with her child, Cassie had no choice but to accept the situation. However, she refused to reunite with Edmund. During the surrogacy, Dinah was determined to make Edmund fall in love with her, but at some point, she miscarried the child yet still pretended to be pregnant and wore padding.\n\nIn the meantime, Cassie was showering Dinah with kindness out of gratitude for carrying her child. Extremely uncomfortable, Dinah wanted to tell Cassie the truth ASAP but Edmund kept putting it off. Finally one night Edmund convinced Dinah that they should simply disappear without ever telling Cassie the truth. He convinced Dinah to record a goodbye message to Ross. After recording the message, Dinah suddenly heard the sound of a baby crying. Edmund immediately covered her mouth with a chloroform rag and she fell to the floor, unconscious. When she awoke, Dinah found herself being held captive in an exact replica of the Jessup farmhouse. She then came face to face with Edmund. After railing at him for setting her up and leaving her alone, Dinah was shocked when he cruelly told her that everything went according to plan and he and Cassie will soon be reunited. He leaves Dinah there, devastated and trapped. Having just read that Michelle Bauer lost her baby in a car accident, Dinah realized that Edmund had stolen Michelle's baby and given it to Cassie. Later, Dinah swiped Edmund's cell phone and later used it to call Cassie. was with Cassie when her phone starts to ring and he answered the call first and covered. Dinah finally tried to reason with Edmund and convince him that his plan would not work, to which Edmund refused to listen. Dinah repeatedly tried to escape Edmund but failed each time. At the same time, Jonathan was shocked to learn that Dinah's baby was born, since he knew she miscarried. Concerned about Dinah, he followed Edmund and found himself outside the recreated farmhouse where Edmund was keeping Dinah. Jonathan was later called away. Unnerved by his close call, Edmund threatened to stop giving Dinah food if she did not find a way to deter Jonathan. So Dinah sent him off with a note to Jonathan that would throw him off her trail. Worried that she would not get out alive, Dinah decided to trick Edmund by hiding in a crevice in the farmhouse. Her plan worked, for when Edmund returned he could not find her. Instead of just leaving the door unlocked as Dinah thought he would, a panicked Edmund locked it behind him and later set fire to it. At the same time, Dinah had stolen Edmund's cell phone again and was using it to call Cassie, unaware that the place was on fire. Although she got through, the signal was lost. Then suddenly realizing a fire was raging around her, she tried to get out but was overcome by the smoke and passed out. Luckily, Detective A.C. Mallet, who had been investigating Edmund happened by and rescued her. Noticing her attention on the cell phone, he pressed redial and got in touch with Cassie, telling her he had found the missing Dinah. That night, Dinah was taken to Cedars where she apologized to Cassie for all she had done. Then in an act of atonement, she took baby Hope and gave her to her rightful father—Danny Santos.\n\nAfter the ordeal with Edmund ended, Dinah began a relationship with Mallet, who was pegged with keeping an eye on her. He stopped her from shooting Edmund. Although she was definitely attracted to Mallet, Dinah had been burned too many times by men and resolved to swear off them. It took some time but eventually a bond formed between the two and they became lovers\nSoon after, in 2006, Dinah became increasingly insecure about Mallet's feelings for Harley, his ex-wife. It did not help that Mallet would frequently drop everything to help Harley who was distraught over the fact that Gus was missing. Despite being jealous, Dinah was determined to be a supportive friend to Harley. Later, Mallet shocked Dinah by asking her to move in with him. Still not secure, a wary Dinah asked if this was his way of telling Harley that he is tired of being her back-up guy. Mallet spoke from his heart, telling Dinah how much she meant to him. Dinah was moved and they made love. The next day, Dinah and Mallet had a small dinner party where they announced the news. However, the occasion was marred when Mallet got a call from Harley and rushed out to help her.\n\nMallet gave Dinah some horrible news—Ross's private plane lost contact shortly after take-off and crashed. It was discovered that Ross was traveling with his female assistant, Nicole Landers. Immediately suspecting her father was having an affair, Dinah ranted about him abandoning his wife and children to go to Washington DC. She was only silenced when Blake slapped her face and yelled at Dinah to not speak about her father that way.\n\nDinah returned to make peace, stating that her half-siblings are all she had left of her father. Dinah begged Blake not to shut her out. Blake told her that what she said about her father was true, but they were never to speak about it again.\n\nDinah and Mallet would eventually become engaged. Vanessa was certain that Dinah had finally grown up and met the man of her dreams, but Matt was extremely skeptical that this wedding was ever going to happen and made that abundantly clear to Vanessa, Dinah and Mallet. When Mallet pressed Matt about his negative attitude, Matt stated that Dinah was the most self-destructive person he had ever met. However, when an upset Dinah professed her love for Mallet and vowed that she would not mess this up, Matt apologized for letting the past color his feelings. Vanessa also apologized for pressuring her about the details but stated that she wanted the wedding to be perfect. Her choice of words got Dinah angry and she blurted out that her wedding would not be perfect, especially since her father could not walk her down the aisle. At that point, Matt surprised her by offering to do it, with Vanessa offering to hang on her other arm. But the wedding went on hold after Dinah, who had an argument with Mallet, supposedly set the Beacon ablaze and Mallet was seriously injured.\n\nMallet confronted Dinah and begged her to admit that she started the fire. Dinah confessed the truth about the fire. Realizing that Jeffrey O'Neill had the charges dropped to get Dinah under his thumb, Mallet tried to convince her that they could fight the charges since it was an accident. However, Dinah refused to take the risk of going back to prison and warned him if he told anyone what she did, she would deny it. She then told him to let their relationship go. Soon after, word got out about Dinah and Jeffrey's meetings because Blake approached Dinah to persuade Dinah that losing Mallet would be a mistake since he was so much like Ross. Dinah saw through her act and accused Blake of wanting Jeffrey all to herself. After Mallet and Dinah both flirted with other people, Mallet finally carried Dinah off so they could talk. As their song began to play, along with slides of their past, Mallet admitted to Dinah that he wanted to marry her; she agreed. They decided to get married right then and there, until Dinah came face to face with Jeffrey. Jeffrey informed Dinah that his cohorts at the government wanted to ruin him, but eventually Dinah would be exonerated and the two would marry. In the last episode, Mallet and Dinah got back together and possibly married.\n\nDinah volunteers at a hospital and finds an injured soldier who calls her out on helping others to make herself feel better about her life. Annoyed Dinah paces, irritated at the soldier's suggestion. Dinah resolves to help him one way or another, but he slaps her hand away as he struggles with his wheelchair. Later, Dinah finds her crippled soldier starting a fight at a bar and stares at him in disbelief. He does not seem to care when Dinah mentions that the other man in the fight could have killed him. Dinah tells him that she is from Springfield. He angrily wheels himself away as he tells her to remind him not to visit. After he leaves, Dinah finds a watch on the floor and realizes who it belongs to. The soldier talks to the military officer and it becomes clear that the soldier is Shayne Lewis. However, Dinah does not know this. Shayne arrives back in Springfield in December. He does not tell anyone that he is in town until the day of Marina and Mallet's Wedding. Shayne then picks a fight with Mallet. Since Dinah and Shayne's first meeting, they became closer. On August 3, 2009, Dinah married Joshua \"Shayne\" Lewis.\n\n"}

While the lines \"You came down the aisle/ Wearing a smile/ A vision of loveliness\" might suggest the song being directed to a female, the best-known versions of the song have been sung by female singers, presumably to male ex-lovers.\n\nThe biggest hit version was recorded by Patti Page. It was recorded on August 6, 1952, and issued by Mercury Records as catalog number 5899, with the flip side \"You Belong to Me.\" It first entered the Billboard chart on August 22, 1952, lasting 21 weeks and reaching #1 on the chart. \"I Went to Your Wedding\" also afforded Page a #1 hit in Australia.\n\nAnother version was recorded by the Sammy Kaye orchestra, on August 15, 1952, and issued by Columbia Records as catalog number 39856. The song was also recorded by Alma Cogan in the United Kingdom in 1952.\n\nA country music version by Hank Snow peaked at number 3 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart in 1952.\n\nThe song was parodied by Spike Jones and his City Slickers later in the decade, depicting the singer as glad to \"get rid\" of the bride. Ray Stevens covered the Spike Jones version in 2012 on the 9-CD project, \"The Encyclopedia of Recorded Comedy Music.\"\n\nThe French rendering of \"I Went To Your Wedding,\" re-titled \"Ton mariage,\" was recorded in 1953 by Lys Assia; Line Renaud and Tino Rossi also recorded versions.\n\nPhilippine singer Victor Wood performed and released a bilingual version of \"I Went To Your Wedding\" in which he alternated the original lyrics with Filipino ones. This particular cover became popular in the Philippines and gave some fame to the entertainer.\n\nThe song's melody is very similar to the old Russian song Po Donu gulyaet kazak molodoi (Young Cossak went near the Don).\n\n"}

He joined the South African Defence Force in 1913.\n\nDuring the years 1914–1915, Brand continued to serve in the Union Defence Force.\n\nIn 1915, Brand travelled to England, where he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps. He learned to fly and was awarded Royal Aero Club Certificate No 3949 on 30 March 1916. During the First World War, he flew Nieuport 17 scouts, serving in No. 1 Squadron RFC in France as a flight commander before being posted back to England.\n\nIn February 1918, Brand became commander 112 Squadron, a home defence night fighter squadron equipped with specially modified Sopwith Camels flying from Throwley in Kent, shooting down a Gotha bomber over Faversham on 19 May. He was then appointed commander of No. 151 Squadron RAF at Fontaine-sur-Maye in France, a night fighter squadron formed to combat German night raids over the Western Front. The squadron downed 26 German aircraft with Brand himself shooting down four, becoming the highest scoring RAF night fighter pilot of the First World War. Brand claimed 12 victories in 1917 and 1918 (seven victories with No 1 Squadron, four with 151 Squadron and one with 112 Squadron) and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross during this period.\n\nIn 1920, \"The Times\" offered a prize of £10,000 for the first pilot to fly from London to Cape Town, South Africa. General Smuts wanted South African aviators to blaze this trail, and subsequently authorised the purchase of a Vickers Vimy, G-UABA named \"Silver Queen\" at a cost of £4,500. Pilots Lieutenant Colonel Pierre van Ryneveld (commander) and Captain Quintin Brand (co-pilot) formed the crew for the record-breaking flight.\n\nLeaving Brooklands on 4 February 1920, they landed safely at Heliopolis, but on the flight to Wadi Halfa, they were forced to land due to engine overheating with 80 miles still to go. A second Vimy was loaned to the pair by the RAF at Heliopolis (and named \"Silver Queen II\"). In this second aircraft, the pair continued to Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia where the aircraft was badly damaged when it crashed on takeoff.; van Rynevald and Brand then borrowed an Airco DH.9 to continue the journey to Cape Town. They were disqualified as winners but nevertheless the South African government awarded them £5,000 each. Along with van Rynevald, Brand was knighted in 1920 for his role in the record attempt.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1927, Brand was Senior Technical Officer, then Principal Technical Officer, at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough. In 1929, he was posted to Abu Qir (Aboukir) Egypt, later appointed Director-General of Aviation in Egypt from 1932 to 1936.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Brand was air officer commanding No. 10 (Fighter) Group, 10 Fighter Battle Group, responsible for the defence of southwest England and South Wales. Brand actively supported Air Vice Marshal Keith Park, in advocating the use of small, rapidly deployed, groups of fighters to intercept the \"Luftwaffe\" raiders. Under Brand's command 10 Group played a vital role in the Battle of Britain by defending southwest England against Luftwaffe raids and providing support to 11 Group (which bore the brunt of the battle in southeast England) as required. \nHe later became the air officer commanding No. 20 (Training) Group. Upon retirement on 6 November 1943, Brand had attained the rank of air vice-marshal. Brand's part in the Big Wing controversy following the Battle of Britain, in which he supported Dowding and Park, may explain why he was sidelined despite being one of the RAF's more capable commanders.\n\nAfter retiring from the regular forces, Brand married Mildred Vaughan in 1943; he had married her sister Marie in 1920, but Marie died in 1941. The Brands lived in Surrey until 1950, when they moved to Southern Rhodesia. Quintin Brand died on 7 March 1968.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is about from downtown Ottawa. Prior to amalgamation in 2001, Carp was located in the West Carleton Township.\n\nCarp is located in the Carleton—Mississippi Mills electoral riding.\n\nAccording to the Canada 2011 Census, 1,965 people lived in the area around Carp (Craig Sideroad/Murphy Sideroad on the north, former Township limits on the east, March Road on the south and Thomas Argue Road on the west)\n\nBy 1866, Carp was a post village with a population of 200 of the Township of Huntley on the Carp river, from Ottawa. The village contained three stores, workshops, three hotels, and a town hall. The Loyal Orange Lodge, No. 439, met at the Orange Hall Carp on the first Wednesday in each month. Citizens included J. W. Featherston, general merchant and postmaster.\n\nThe village takes its name from the Carp River which runs through the village.\nThe main street was formerly a section of the Trans-Canada Highway and carried much of the traffic coming from the west into Ottawa. However the village has been bypassed with the development of the Highway 417.\n\nWith the amalgamation of municipal governments in the region in 2001, Carp is now governed as part of the new city of Ottawa. Carp is used as a mailing address for most of the former Huntley Township. As such, residents of this large area will identify themselves as living in Carp although they may live large distances from the village proper.\n\nThe town is situated on the southern end of the Carp Hills, a small range of pristine hills that have been compared to Gatineau Park. Several walking trails start in or near the town.\n\nThe Carleton Masonic Lodge #465, a turn of the century (1900s) church building has been the Masonic Lodge in the Village of Carp since 1925. The building features original stained glass windows and is decorated with beautiful oak furniture that was originally located in a World War I Military Masonic Lodge in France. The original Masonic lodge building, which dates to 1904 was destroyed by fire in 1920.\n\nCarp was the site of an alleged 1989 UFO landing. It has been called \"One of the most significant cases in UFO history.\" Someone dubbed 'Guardian' filmed the entire UFO crash. The American TV show \"Unsolved Mysteries\" filmed an episode on Guardian in 1993.\n\nThere are three schools in the Carp area: Huntley Centennial Public School, St. Michael's (Corkery), and Venta, a private school which abruptly closed in late 2017 after the death of its founder.\n\nThe Carp Airport is just south of the village. Carp also has a junior ice hockey team called the West Carleton Inferno.\n\nCarp's main attraction is the Diefenbunker, Canada's Cold War museum just north of the village, and was featured in the film \"The Sum of All Fears\". This former top-secret underground bunker was built to house key members of the government in the event of a nuclear attack on Ottawa.\n\nIn 1960, NATO and the Canadian Department of National Defence built a satellite communications (SATCOM) station which supports a diameter metal space frame radar dome (radome) on its roof, which provides environmental protection for the diameter SATCOM antenna it houses. Until 1999 when NATO and DND decommissioned the site, the antenna provided satellite communications between all NATO countries. Two CLM Rotating sirens can also be seen in the photo on the left.

He was one of the original philatelic journalists.\n\nMoens began collecting stamps from his family's mail as a boy in Tournai. He was the son of Colette Blangenois and Phillipe Moens, a soldier. He began with a small business in coins. By 1853, at age nineteen, he was buying and selling new and second-hand books, and stamps, from the Galerie Borthier, a covered walkway in central Brussels. Within a decade he was putting out a stamp catalog with illustrated supplements.\n\nIn March 1862, with Louis Hanciau, Moens published a catalog of stamps, the \"Manuel des collectionneurs de timbres-poste\" (Handbook for Stamp Collectors). This work is the first of its kind in Belgium and the second in the French language, following that of the Parisian, Alfred Potiquet. Also in 1862, he published \"De la falsification des timbres-poste\" (On the falsification of postage stamps) to alert stamp enthusiasts to the abundance of forgeries. He began the first French language philatelic monthly, \"Le Timbre-Poste\", which ran from 1863 until 1900, as well as a series on fiscal stamps from 1874 until 1896.\n\nMoens became the owner of eight of the \"Post Office\" Mauritius stamps. In 1878 Moens published the first of his works on the early stamps of Mauritius, \"Les Timbres de Maurice depuis leur origine jusqu'à nos jours,\" (The Stamps of Mauritius from their Origin until Today), benefiting from the studies of Edward B. Evans, the Philatelic Society of London, and Judge Frederick Philbrick. Helen Morgan noted, \"All that is known of the discovery of the first specimens of the Post Office issue, indeed of much of the history of the handful of those stamps eventually found, came from his pen in the late 1890s. He handled most of the Post Office stamps discovered by Madame Borchard in the late 1860s.\"\n\nMoens was an Honorary Member of the Fiscal Philatelic Society until his death.\n\nAs Moens' business prospered, he assembled a large stock of collectibles of all kinds and a library devoted to music and antiquities, as well as stamps. By 1 November 1899, to preserve his health, Jean-Baptiste announced in \"Le Timbre-poste\" that the time had come to free himself from the duties of publication and to liquidate most of his stock in trade. After selling his rarities, the residue of Moens' stock, with a catalogue value of £196,000 (1882 catalogue), was sold the following year to M Rubens, a stamp dealer of Copenhagen for an undisclosed figure. His philatelic publications were eventually sold to H. Edgar Weston, in London, in 1907.\n\nJean-Baptiste Moens died in Ixelles in 1908 and was interred there in the Ixelles Cemetery. His passing was noted by the philatelic press, many referring to him as \"The Father of Philately\".\n\n\n"}

The genus is named after Sir John Shore, the governor-general of the British East India Company, 1793–1798. The timber of trees of the genus is sold under the common names lauan, luan, lawaan, meranti, seraya, balau, bangkirai, and Philippine mahogany.\n\n\"Shorea\" spp. are native to Southeast Asia, from northern India to Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In west Malesia and the Philippines, this genus dominates the skyline of the tropical forests. The tallest documented tropical angiosperm is an 88.3-m-tall \"Shorea faguetiana\" in the Tawau Hills National Park, in Sabah on the island of Borneo, and in that park at least five other species of the genus have been measured to be over 80 m tall: \"S. argentifolia\", \"S. gibbosa\", \"S. johorensis\", \"S. smithiana\", and \"S. superba\". Borneo is also the hotspot of \"Shorea\" diversity with 138 species, of which 91 are endemic to the island.\n\nThe majority of \"Shorea\" spp. are general flowering species, which is an event that occurs at irregular intervals of 3–10 yr, in which nearly all dipterocarp species together with species of other families bloom heavily. General flowering is thought to have evolved to satiate seed predators and/or to facilitate pollination. Both explanations apparently hold merit. Flowering is thought to be triggered by droughts that occur during transition periods from La Niña to El Niño. The magnitude of a flowering event is suggested to be dependent on the timing of the droughts associated with the El Niño southern oscillation (ENSO) cycle, with the largest events occurring after an interval of several years with no flowering.\n\n\"Shorea\" spp. are insect pollinated and a variety of insects have been implicated, with species within the sections of \"Shorea\" sharing the same insect pollinators. Flowering within a section is sequential within one habitat and species association to prevent competition for pollinators.\n\nMany economically important timber trees belong to \"Shorea\". They are sold under various trade names including \"lauan\", \"lawaan\", \"meranti\", \"seraya\", \"balau\", \"bangkirai\", and \"Philippine mahogany\". (For a list of species associated with each name, see the article on Dipterocarp timber classification.) The \"Philippine mahogany\" sold in North America is not a true mahogany at all, but a mixture of woods from the genus \"Shorea\".\n\nOther products from \"Shorea\" spp. include dammar and illepe. Dammar is a resin collected from a variety of species. It varies in colour among the different taxonomic groups. \"Shorea wiesneri\" is listed in many websites as an important source of dammar; however, this appears to be either a trade name or a synonym.\n\nBorneo tallow nut oil is extracted from the egg-shaped, winged fruit of \"Shorea\" species.\n\nOf the 148 species of \"Shorea\" currently listed on the IUCN Redlist, the most are listed as being critically endangered. Some concerns exist regarding the IUCN's listing of dipterocarps, as the criteria used to assess the level of threat are based mainly on animal population characteristics. This is thought to overstate the threat assessment, when applied to long-lived, habitat-specific organisms such as trees. Furthermore, one species reportedly extinct on the IUCN Red list, \"Shorea cuspidata\", is reported to be common in the Bako National Park and also present in the Lambir National Park. The \"Shorea\" species page gives threat classifications.\n\n"}

Dalbec approached Matt Firestone to sing and they played under the moniker of Gateway for a few shows, before Firestone parted ways to focus on other projects. Dalbec then approached Aaron Bedard (who had previously sung for the Worcester, Massachusetts hardcore band Backbone) about singing for Bane. They went into the studio in December 1995 with a few friends and released a five-song demo. The next year saw the release of their first EP, and many shows throughout central Massachusetts. In early 1997, Bane released \"Free to Think, Free to Be\" EP, and in 1998 the band released the \"Holding This Moment\" 7\" and CD collection, and embarked upon their first US tour. Like many other hardcore bands, Bane are known for their promotion of tolerance and unity within the scene.\n\nIn 2014, Bane released their final album, \"Don't Wait Up\", with the band stating that they still plan to tour. They played their last show on June 18, 2016 at the Worcester Palladium.\n\nThe band was founded in 1994 under the name Gateway. It was supposed to be intended only as a side project to Aaron Dalbec’s actual band Converge. In 1995 singer Aaron Bedard was asked to take over frontman duties. They quickly recorded a first demo, which contained five songs. Pete Chilton was added as bassist while Zach Jordan joined the band as second guitarist. Damon Bellorado, also a member of Converge, took over drumming duties.\n\nIn May 1996, Bane released the EP ‘Forked Tongue’ and in 1997, ‘Free to Think, Free to Be joined., Both EPs appeared on Life Records. It was around this time that drummer Bellorado left the band in order to concentrate fully on Converge. Bellorado was briefly replaced by Ten Yard Fight drummer Ben Chused, before he was replaced in mid-1998 by the 19-year-old Nick Branigan (Close Call). A tour followed the release of Holding This Moment, which was actually a compilation of previously released EPs. In addition, the band held a US tour starting with Saves the Day.\n\nThe album \"It All Comes Down to This\" was recorded in June 1999 in Austin Enterprises in Clinton, Massachusetts. The album was released on Equal Vision Records. In 2000, a tour followed by North America with Death by Stereo and Adamantium, as well as performances in Europe. In early September 2000, the band went into the studio again, where Converge Member Kurt Ballou worked as a producer to record two songs for a split release with Adamantium, which appeared on Indecision Records. Their second album Give Blood, which was released in 2001 was, in recorded and produced by Brian McTernan in Beltsville, Maryland. The release was followed with a tour of the USA along with Agnostic. In 2003, drummer Branigan left the band and was replaced by Bob Mahoney. Bane \\ followed with another tour of the USA, as well as a two-week tour of Japan in April 2004.\n\nIn 2005 the band then went into the Salad Days Studios to record their next album titled The Note with producer McTernan, which appeared on Equal Vision Records. In March 2005, the band held a US tour with Comeback Kid and With Honour. In 2014, Bane released their final album, \"Don't Wait Up\", with the band stating that they still plan to tour. They played their last show on June 18, 2016 at the Worcester Palladium.\n\nIn an early album Bane claimed straight edge, however it was never their main lyrical focus. The current original members are straight edge; Bob Mahoney and Stu are not. They still perform early songs with straight edge references, such as \"Count Me Out\" which includes the lyric \"Just like this X on the back of my hand, I'm not going nowhere\". However the lyrics to the song \"Wasted On The Young\", on Bane's album \"The Note\" can be interpreted as criticism of people who ignorantly claim straight edge too early in their life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It stars Tom Guiry, Mike Vitar, Karen Allen, Denis Leary, and James Earl Jones. The filming locations were in Midvale, Salt Lake City, and Ogden, Utah. It grossed $34 million worldwide and has become a cult film.\n\nIn the summer of 1962, brainy, reserved fifth grader Scotty Smalls moves with his parents to the San Fernando Valley, where he has difficulty making friends. He tries to join a group of boys who play baseball daily in a local sandlot, but is embarrassed by his inability to catch or throw the ball. An attempt to learn to play catch with his stepfather, Bill, results in a black eye. Nevertheless, he is invited to join the team by their leader and best player, Benny Rodriguez, who mentors him. When catcher Hamilton \"Ham\" Porter hits a home run into a backyard, Scotty attempts to retrieve the ball but is stopped by the other boys, who tell him of \"the Beast\", a junkyard dog supposedly so large and savage that it has become a neighborhood legend. Many baseballs hit into the yard over the years have all been claimed by the Beast, which is kept chained up by its owner, Mr. Mertle. \n\nOne particularly hot day, the boys visit the community pool. Michael \"Squints\" Palledorous has a crush on lifeguard Wendy Peffercorn, and fakes drowning in order to get her to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. The sandlot team is banned from the pool, but Squints' reputation is boosted. On the Fourth of July the team plays a night game by the light of the fireworks, and Scotty observes that although to the rest of them baseball is just a game, it is Benny's true passion. Later, they are challenged to play against a rival Little League team whom they handily defeat. To celebrate, they visit a fair where they try chewing tobacco and ride a spinning carnival ride; the combination causes them to vomit all over themselves and others.\n\nOne day, Benny hits the team's only baseball so hard that he knocks the cover off. With Bill away on business, Scotty borrows a baseball from his trophy room that is autographed by legendary player Babe Ruth. Being ignorant of baseball history, Scotty does not realize the ball's value, and hits his first home run, sending it into the Beast's yard. When the other boys learn of the autograph, they tell Scotty its value and make several attempts to get the ball out of the yard using makeshift retrieval devices, but each is destroyed by the Beast. Benny has a dream in which the spirit of Babe Ruth advises him to retrieve the ball himself, and that this will be the moment that makes him a legend.\n\nBenny goes over the fence and \"pickles\" the Beast to retrieve the ball, but the English Mastiff breaks its chain and leaps over the fence in pursuit. It chases Benny through town, resulting in several comedic situations, and eventually back to the sandlot. Benny jumps back into Mr. Mertle's yard, but the Beast crashes through the fence, which falls down on top of it. Scotty and Benny lift the fence to free the dog, who shows gratitude by leading them to its stash of baseballs. They meet Mr. Mertle, who turns out to be a former baseball player who played with Babe Ruth but went blind after being struck by a baseball. He kindly trades them the chewed-up ball for one autographed by all of the 1927 New York Yankees. Scotty gives this ball to Bill, and their father-and-son relationship improves. The boys continue to play baseball on the sandlot, with the Beast—whose real name is Hercules—as their mascot.\n\nOver the next few years, the sandlot kids go their separate ways. Benny's exploit with the Beast earns him the nickname \"the Jet\", and he goes on to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Scotty becomes a sports commentator, and covers a game against the San Francisco Giants in which Benny successfully steals home. Celebrating his victory, the two exchange thumbs up.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 61% from critics based on 54 reviews, with an average rating of 5.92/10, but an approval rating of 89% from the Audience, based on over 261,000 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"It may be shamelessly derivative and overly nostalgic, but \"The Sandlot\" is nevertheless a genuinely sweet and funny coming-of-age adventure.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.Metacritic gave the film a score of 55 based of 27 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nCritic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars, comparing the movie to a summertime version of \"A Christmas Story\", based on the tone and narration of both films: \"There was a moment in the film when Rodriguez hit a line drive directly at the pitcher's mound, and I ducked and held up my mitt, and then I realized I didn't have a mitt, and it was then I also realized how completely this movie had seduced me with its memories of what really matters when you are 12.\" Bob Cannon of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a B+, praising its simplicity and strong fundamentals.\n\nLeonard Klady of \"Variety\" gave the film a mostly negative review. He praised the cinematography and score, but felt the baseball team did not come together, and that the film, while sincere, was a \"remarkably shallow wade, rife with incident and slim on substance.\"\n\nThe film grossed $4,000,000 in its opening week-end and a further $32,000,000 through ticket sales. Figures for world-wide VHS and DVD sales are estimated to be at $76,000,000. Since its release on both VHS and DVD, the film has become a cult favorite.\n\nIn 1998, Michael Polydoros sued 20th Century Fox and the producers of the film for defamation. Polydoros, a childhood classmate of David Mickey Evans, the writer and director of \"The Sandlot\", claimed that the character Michael \"Squints\" Palledorous was derogatory and caused him shame and humiliation. The trial court found in favor of the film-makers, and that finding was affirmed by the California Court of Appeal. After initially agreeing to review the case in 1998, the Supreme Court of California reversed its decision, dismissing the review and reinstating the Court of Appeal's opinion in favor of 20th Century Fox.\n\nIn 1993, \"The Sandlot\" first came to home video in a slipcase, along with the LaserDisc in widescreen, but later came in a clam shell case in 1994. On January 29, 2002, the DVD came in a \"Family Feature\", in widescreen (Side B) and full screen (Side A). The 2013 repackaged DVD is only in widescreen. On March 26, 2013, the film released on Blu-ray for the first time to celebrate its 20th anniversary. The film then had a rerelease on Blu-ray and Digital HD on March 27, 2018 as part of the film's 25th anniversary.\n\n\nThe film's original score was composed by David Newman, and was not released until 2006, when a limited edition was released as part of the Varèse Sarabande CD Club. This release paired it with selections from Newman's score for \"The War of the Roses\" A complete release devoted exclusively to the score in observance of the film's 25th anniversary by La-La Land Records in 2018.\n\n"}

In 1723 the tax was reduced to 10%.\n\nRather than levy the tax on the basis of the amount of silver or gold produced, the government tracked the amount of mercury used. Mercury was essential for the refinement of silver and gold in the patio process (see also amalgamation). The Spanish government had a monopoly of mercury production, through its mines at Almadén in Spain and at Huancavelica in Peru. In 1648 the Viceroy of Peru declared that Potosí and Huancavelica were \"the two pillars that support this kingdom and that of Spain.\" Moreover, the viceroy thought that Spain could, if necessary, dispense with the silver from Potosí, but it could not dispense with the mercury from Huancavelica.\n\n"}

Founded by Mary E. Behner in the tradition of the settlement house movement, \"The Shack\" continues to serve their social, educational, recreational, economic, and health needs.\n\nSponsored by mission the First Presbyterian Church in Morgantown and the church's National Board of Missions, \"The Shack\" sought to meet the spiritual as well as the social and physical needs of coal miners and their families. During the Great Depression, Eleanor Roosevelt visited \"The Shack\" and the especially hard hit Scotts Run area. Nearly two-thirds of the area's residents were suffering in terrible poverty. There were 10,000 people and 22 different nationalities clustered on hills and near polluted creeks along the nine miles of eight communities.\n\nMary Behner, a 1928 College of Wooster graduate, was first given an abandoned schoolhouse in Stumptown and started a Sunday School and recreation there in November 1928. But soon children were coming to her without food and clothes. She expanded into social service. Hundreds attended her programs. She brought nearby West Virginia University students to teach. She started a library, charm school, choruses, sewing club, and the first integrated nursery school.\n\nIn 1932, she received from the coal company an abandoned company store which she named The Shack. The Quakers and other agencies handled relief programs from The Shack. She started the Uhyscool Club to encourage the first students to finish high school and college. The area was photographed by Lewis Hine, Ben Shahn and Walker Evans. The Shack was written up in the Christian Science Monitor and other publications. Behner left in 1937 to be married. Her diaries and photos were donated to the West Virginia Division of Culture and History.\n\nA new Shack building was finished in 1938 west of the original site and a third building down the same Route 7 which exists today. On May 6, 2008, an historical marker was placed near the original site, along a now widened Route 7 in Pursglove. Her daughter, Bettijane Christopher Burger, of Charleston, WV, petitioned the state for the marker. Most of the mines are closed and the hills returned to grassy slopes.\n\nIn 2006, The Shack received an outreach grant from the Mollohan Foundation for the Appalachian Rags to Rugs Program. As of 2012, The Shack continues to provide \"a safe, secure place for families and children to come and play. We attempt to provide services for children throughout their entire school careers, during the entire year,\" including preschool, after school programs, and swimming lessons.\n\nEven though the religious mission of \"The Shack\" ended when the church planted there by the Presbyterian Church (USA) had closed, it continued to operate with support from the PC(USA), other denominations, the United Way, and generous donors.

Most of the district lies within the boundaries of the City of Houston, the City of Katy or their municipalities' extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ). Unincorporated areas in Katy ISD include Barker, Cinco Ranch, and Cimarron.\n\nAll residential areas of the district are assigned to an elementary school, a junior high school, and a high school by subdivision.\n\nDuring the 2004–2005 school year Katy ISD began a new and revolutionary program in the history of the district, with the use of random drug testing for all individuals involved in UIL competitive organizations, student leaders of any official school clubs, and anyone wishing to park on campus. This caused much controversy prior to its instatement. Many parents complained to the school district, citing the new policy as the violation of individual rights. The district responded to this by having every student who wished to participate in the said activities sign a waiver granting the school district to test them randomly. This matter had already been settled by the Supreme Court of the United States as constitutional before KISD chose to implement it.\n\nIn 2015 two sections of Thornwood, two and three, currently served by KISD, proposed being removed from KISD and placed in the Spring Branch Independent School District, but both KISD and SBISD's boards denied the proposal.\n\nSuperintendent Lance Hindt was an alumnus of Katy Taylor High School, and in 2012 wrote a Phd thesis for the University of Houston (UH). In 2018 individuals accused Hindt of severe bullying while he was enrolled in KISD's secondary schools. A former classmate of Hindt, later a judge in Alabama, accused him of severe bullying while he was enrolled in high school. National Association of Scholars president Peter Wood accused superintendent Lance Hindt of plagiarizing his dissertation. The University of Houston administration stated that it would investigate the matter. After an 18-month investigation, the University of Houston removed Hindt's dissertation from their official website. That year Hindt resigned, and the district agreed to pay $700,000 as severance; that time Hindt described the allegations as a \"smear campaign\" against him.

He graduated from the 27th class of the Army War College (Japan) and was known for his fascination with all things Chinese.\n\nIn 1928, Isogai was attached to the IJA 3rd Division. He was given command of the IJA 7th Infantry Regiment from 1928–1930, and became Chief of Staff of the IJA 1st Division in 1930.\n\nFrom 1931-1937, he held a number of staff positions within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff; however, with the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Isogai volunteered to be a military attaché to China. The position was very short, as he was soon assigned to a combat command as the commander in chief of the IJA 10th Division in China, participating in the Tianjin–Pukou Railway Operation and the Battle of Taierzhuang.\n\nIn 1938, Isogai was transferred to Manchukuo as Chief of Staff of the Kwangtung Army shortly before the disastrous Nomonhan Incident. He was recalled to Japan, and forced into retirement in 1939.\n\nWith the start of the Pacific War, Isogai was recalled to active duty in 1942. He was appointed Governor-General of Japanese-occupied Hong Kong on February 20, 1942 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō, his former superior officer while serving with the Kwangtung Army.\n\nDuring Isogai's tenure, Hong Kong was subjected to martial law. He based his command post at the Peninsula Hotel in Kowloon. Although Isogai arrived after the worst excesses committed by Japanese troops against civilians during the conquest of Hong Kong, and Isogai's troops (for the most part) were more disciplined than most Japanese forces in mainland China, Hongkongers suffered much deprivation from food shortages. The creation and subsequent inflation of the Japanese Military Yen, a currency without reserves issued by the Japanese Imperial Army administration, caused severe disruption of the economy, impoverishing many Hong Kong residents. Public transportation and utilities unavoidably failed, due to shortage of fuel and American air raids killed thousands, leaving more homeless.\n\nWhile Isogai was much hated by many older generations of Hong Kong people, Isogai is credited with introducing an important element of Hong Kong life during his tenure: Sunday horseracing. Sunday horseracing is now a very important part of Hong Kong culture, in which thousands participate. Also, Isogai was responsible for the addition of Japanese elements of architecture on the facade of the Hong Kong Government House.\n\nIsogai retired from the post on December 24, 1944, and returned to Japan. At the end of the war, he was arrested by the SCAP authorities and extradited to Nanjing, China, where he faced a military tribunal for war crimes committed during the occupation of Hong Kong. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, but released in 1952, and allowed to return to Japan. He died in 1967.\n\n\n"}

Historically, the commercial activities of the city focused on agriculture and fishing. In recent years, however, there has been a significant shift towards service industries and tourism. There is also a substantial manufacturing sector.\n\nThe town of Quy Nhơn was officially founded in the late 18th century, although its origins stretch back much further to the 11th-century Champa culture, the Tây Sơn dynasty and the 18th century seaport of Thị Nại. During the 1620s the town was host to Portuguese Jesuits who called the place Pulo Cambi.\n\nDuring the Ming treasure voyages of the 15th century, the Chinese fleet led by Admiral Zheng He would always make port at Qui Nhơn in Champa as their first destination after leaving China.\n\nThe city is renowned as the birthplace of 18th century Vietnamese emperor Nguyễn Huệ and, more recently, had a large American military presence during the Vietnam War. Today the city is recognized as a first class city with a geo-economic priority and an urbanized infrastructure. The government describes it as one of the three commercial and tourism centres of the central southern coastal region (with Đà Nẵng and Nha Trang).\n\nQuy Nhơn has a varied topography, being extremely diversified with mountains and forests, hills, fields, salt marshes, plains, lagoons, lakes, rivers, shorelines, peninsulas and islands. Its coastline is 42 km long with sandy beaches, abundant seafood resources and other natural products of economic value.\n\nThe city has sixteen wards: Trần Hưng Đạo, Lê Lợi, Lê Hồng Phong, Trần Phú, Lý Thường Kiệt, Nguyễn Văn Cừ, Đống Đa, Thị Nại, Hải Cảng, Ngô Mây, Ghềnh Ráng, Quang Trung, Nhơn Bình, Nhơn Phú, Bùi Thị Xuân and Trần Quang Diệu. It has five villages: Nhơn Lý, Nhơn Hội, Nhơn Châu, Nhơn Hải and Phước Mỹ (which was spun off from Tuy Phước District and merged into Quy Nhơn city in 2006) with a total area of 284.28 km² and a population of about 284,000 people.\n\nQuy Nhơn is served by Vietnam Airlines, Bamboo Airways, VietJet Air and Jetstar Pacific through Phù Cát Airport, with flights to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nQuy Nhơn railway station could be reached by a branch off the main line of the North–South railway, but this line was suspended in May 2016. Reunification express trains stop only in Diêu Trì railway station, which is around 10 km west of Quy Nhơn.\n\nQuy Nhơn is one of the main industrial centres of the South Central Coast, behind only Đà Nẵng and Nha Trang. It is also the major industrial and service centre of Bình Định Province, including its largest industrial facilities at Phu Tai Industrial Park and Nhơn Hội Economic Zone. The city's economic activities include industries, export-imports, seaport services, aquatic product husbandry and tourism. The economic trend, at present, is increasingly service-based at the expense of agriculture, forestry and pisciculture.\n\nCereals are cultivated on 2548 ha of Quy Nhơn's land with an output of 13,021 tons as of 2009, just 2% of the province's total. Other crops included 10,891 tons of vegetables, 2,795 tons of sugar-cane, as well as smaller amounts of coconuts, peanuts and cashew nuts.\n\nMuch of the city's industry is concentrated in and around Phu Tai Industrial Park in the west of the city along National Route 1A. Quy Nhơn is a major centre of garden furniture manufacturing. It has traditionally been relying on access to wood from Bình Định's forests as well as the Central Highlands provinces of Gia Lai and Kon Tum and even as far as Cambodia's Ratanakiri and Laos' Attapeu Province. Most of the furniture factories are located in Phu Tai Industrial Park. Several chemical enterprises that supply the furniture and wood processing industry have been set up in the vicinity of the industrial park.\n\nOther industries in Quy Nhơn process agricultural and aquatic products, or produce construction materials and paper products. Bidiphar is a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Quy Nhơn that is an exception to the city's general focus on basic and wood processing industries. Nhơn Hội Economic Zone is central to the city's and province's industrial development plans. However, as of late 2010 it was still in the early stages of development, with few factories completed.\n\nQuy Nhơn has seen only limited foreign investment. As of 2008, 13 foreign companies employed 1119 people in the city.\n\nCurrently the economic structure of Quy Nhơn is a shift towards increasing the proportion of service industries, reducing the rate of agriculture, forestry and fisheries in GDP. The shares of agriculture, forestry and fisheries – industrial and construction – services in GDP in 2006 reached 36.7%, 28% and 35.3%, respectively, while in 2005 it was at 38.4%, 26.7% and 34.9%, respectively.\n\nThe income per capita in 2018 was US$6,025 per person.\n\nQui Nhơn has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification: \"As\").\n\nQuy Nhơn has two universities: Quy Nhơn University and Quang Trung University. As of 2009 they had a total teaching staff of 601 and 23,383 students, 13,704 of whom were female.

{"id": "2068965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2068965", "title": "Grand Marshal (RPI)", "text": "Grand Marshal (RPI)\n\nThe Grand Marshal, or GM, is the highest elected student leader of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The position has been in existence since shortly after the American Civil War.\n\nArticle V, Section II of the Rensselaer Union Constitution, defines the position Grand Marshal and establishes this position as the presiding officer of the Student Senate and an \"ex officio\" member of all committees and role as the leader and the chief spokesperson for the entire Union.\n\nThe Grand Marshal is normally a nonvoting member of the Student Senate. However, in the event of a tie, the Grand Marshal may cast one vote. The Grand Marshal has the power to appoint student representatives. However, any appointments made may be nullified by a majority vote of the entire Student Senate membership.\n\nThe Grand Marshal serves on Institute committees as representative of the student body, and meets with the President and Board of Trustees to represent student interests.\n\nThe position of Grand Marshal was created in 1866 to honor a student respected and admired by his classmates. Major Albert Metcalf Harper of Delta Phi was elected and presented a ceremonial sword, as was fitting for a major during the Civil War. His function was to head and represent the entire student body on all occasions in all relations, thereby giving it a formal unity. Except for a few years during the 1890s, Grand Marshals were elected each year, usually in the spring, and this provided, as it were, the culminating event of the student calendar with celebrations of the Grand Marshal's election and installation.\n\nThe election customs were well established by 1882, when Independence Grove, a strangely named junior, of Chi Phi, was elected Grand Marshal. In 1883 occurred a characteristic Grand Marshal's election night on May 26. William A. Aycrigg was chosen without opposition in Harmony Hall, used for many years for the purpose, and the retiring marshal was presented with a suitably inscribed gold-headed cane. The students then filed into the streets and, headed by Doring's Band, paraded through the city, with Greek fire displays and houses illuminated. They stopped at Boughton's hat store, where the new marshal was presented with a high silk hat, still used symbolically as the headgear of the office.\n\nA common practice of the student parade was to serenade the students of the Emma Willard School, located in downtown, as well as some of the professors and school dignitaries at their homes, and they generally responded with speeches of acknowledgment. At about eleven at night the parade returned to Harmony Hall for food, drink and dancing. Until the wee hours of the morning, the press reported, the shouts and plaudits could be heard for blocks on the still night air. In 1883 the total expenses of the election were $212.50, raised by class assessments, and they included $28 for the hall and damages to it, $127 for the music, and $12 for the services of the 8 policemen at the hall.\n\nThe political order on the postwar Rensselaer campus was also transmitted from the past and continued to function despite discontent and the desire for reform. The Student Union as an association of all students had its roots in the nineteenth century, although its modern and formal organization dated from 1908. Its two heads, one the Grand Marshal, and the other, president of the Union, carried great prestige, and harked back to the nineteenth century. They were the occasion for an annual student campaign, election, and celebration which were encrusted with tradition and lively youthful antics. On these foundations was erected in due course a broad system of student elections, comprising class officers and members of the Student Council, in which the fraternities almost from the first played a prominent, if not dominant, role. The spring week of hectic campaigning and voting culminated in the celebration of Grand Marshal's Night. How genuinely democratic this election system is can be debated, but it has persisted as the one unifying, all-Institute event, accompanied by the frenzied excitement of electioneering characteristic of American politics generally and caricatured by the exploits and ebullience of youth.\n\nThe election of the grand marshal has undergone many changes since the position was created in 1865. In the 1880's the GM was elected by a \"caucus\" of students at a location off campus in an environment that might not have been conducive to intelligent voting. These 1886 Transit illustrations indicate that the process was reformed. Institute regulations, city and state laws, and changes in society have continued to modify election events. In spite of change, Rensselaer alumni share fond memories of these GM nights, days, or weeks, whether they were held on or off campus and with of without certain beverages of entertainment.\n\nToday, a special committee plans the \"GM week\" events, which occur in the last week of March. The week kicks off with events in the Armory; in the past these have included twister, miniature golf, rock climbing, a pie eating contests, and laser tag. Then there are dozens of events each day of the week, hosted by various clubs and fraternities. Events usually include battle of the bands style concerts, tennis and volleyball tournaments, fireworks, and engineering contests such as an egg drop competition from the top of the JEC. At the end of the week, the final induction ceremony is often held in the Houston Field House.\n\nThere have been 154 Grand Marshals in the history of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Meagan Lettko ’20 was elected Grand Marshal during Grand Marshal Week 2019 and is currently serving for the 2019-20 term.\n\n"}

She was named for Weedon Osborne.\n\n\"Osborne\" was laid down 23 September 1919 at Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Squantum, Massachusetts; launched 29 December 1919; co-sponsored by Mrs. Elizabeth Osborne Fisher, sister of Ltjg W. E. Osborne and Mrs. C. H. Cox; and commissioned 17 May 1920, Lieutenant Dennis L. Ryan in command.\n\nCommissioned into a peacetime navy curtailed by a retrenching Congress, the undermanned four-stacker departed Boston, Massachusetts 25 June to join DESRON 3, Atlantic Fleet. The limited coastal operations of 1920 were supplemented by 2 months of fleet exercises and battle problems off Cuba during the first quarter of 1921. Whether operating out of Charleston, South Carolina, her normal base of operations, or out of the Brooklyn or Philadelphia Navy Yards \"Osborne\" regularly steamed southward early each year for these competitive exercises and large scale tactical maneuvers. These useful testing periods brought a familiarization not only with the Caribbean area but also the Pacific coast of Panama. Under the new command of Raymond A. Spruance, \"Osborne\" steamed from Boston 18 June 1925, to \"show the flag\" on an extensive year-long cruise in the western half of the Mediterranean Sea and along the western European coastline.\n\nOn 20 September 1929 entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for inactivation. \"Osborne\" decommissioned 1 May 1930 with her crew transferring to the newly recommissioned . In accordance with the agreements reached at the London Naval Disarmament Conference of 1930, she was struck from the Navy List 22 October 1930 and sold for scrap 17 January 1931.\n\nThe ship was sold to Standard Fruit Company of New Orleans where she was gutted to her hull and fitted with two new deck houses, electrical plant and other ship service plants and with dual Ingersoll-Rand Diesel engines by Todd Dry Dock and Construction Company. With the new name \"Matagalpa\" and four holds capable of carrying a total of 25,000 banana stems between Central America and New Orleans the Standard Fruit & Steamship Company operated banana boat operated until the eve of World War II. The ship was surveyed and taken by the Navy under a bare boat charter until the urgent need to resupply the Philippines as Japanese forces took Manila resulted in their being taken over by the United States Army.\n\nOn 22 February 1942 General MacArthur had requested direct support from Honolulu rather than Australia as it was lacking in resources. Within a day a very high level study of the situation concluded three old ex destroyers converted into fast commercial fruit carriers, now named \"Masaya\", Matagalpa and \"Teapa\", and recently taken over under bare boat charter by the War Department with intentions to use them as inter-island transports would be suited to that supply requirement. Under urgent Presidential orders to support the forces in Bataan and Corregidor the Army began to prepare the ships to run the Japanese blockade of the Philippines. Cargoes were shipped to New Orleans for the three ships. They were originally due to sail on 28 February 1942 but difficulties, including securing naval gun crews to put on the ships, delayed sailing. \"Masaya\" sailed on 2 March 1942, \"Matagalpa\" on 11 March and \"Teapa\" on 18 March. While the situation in the Philippines became desperate the three ships were forced to stop in Los Angeles for repair. On 13 April General MacArthur reported blockade running was \"useless,\" but the War Department decided to make the attempt. The ships were reloaded with \"Matagalpa\" loaded for Mindanao and arriving in Honolulu on 8 May 1942, too late to relieve Corregidor. \"Matagalpa\" and the other ships intended for supply of the Philippines, were diverted to Australia.\n\nOn 26 June 1942 \"Matagalpa\" burned at her berth in Sydney, Australia as over one hundred firefighters worked to unload gasoline drums and fight the fire. \"Matagalpa\" was not repaired and was scuttled in the \"disposal area\" off Sydney on 6 September 1947.\n\n"}

The plot concerns a school shooting. It was inspired by the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.\n\nAndre Kriegman (based on Eric Harris) and Calvin Gabriel (based on Dylan Klebold) announce their intention to attack their school, Iroquois High School, calling their plan \"Zero Day\". They keep a video diary on the camera, carefully hiding it from their friends and families. The majority of the film is portrayed through their video filming, and shows them planning, preparing, and explaining some of their motives.\n\nOther scenes show the two attending Andre's birthday party, egging the house of someone they dislike, and Cal going to the prom while Andre works at a pizza place. In one video entry, Cal notes the origin of the name \"Zero Day\": Cal and Andre originally planned to attack on the first day on which the temperature dropped to zero degrees after they had finished their preparations. This plan soon proved impractical, and they set May 1, 2001 as the new date. Wanting their attack to have a memorable name, they agreed to keep the original title.\n\nThe boys arrive at school on May 1 and prepare their plan and weapons in Andre's car. Andre says that he could never have carried out Zero Day without Cal's help, a sentiment Cal echoes. They run into the school, armed with two .45-caliber semi-automatic pistols (Glock 21C & Norinco M1911), a .357 Magnum Ruger GP100 revolver, an M1 carbine, and a Smith and Wesson Model 3000 12-gauge pump-action shotgun w/ a “short skirt”/illegally-modified stock (nicknamed \"Milena\"), all stolen from Andre's father and cousin. The shooting is shown through the viewpoint of security cameras very similar to Columbine High School massacre's view. The dialogue is heard via the cellphone of a student who is shot and killed. Shooting at anyone they see, Andre and Cal kill eleven students, one school resource officer, and wound eighteen others. The pair eventually see law enforcement arriving in force after sixteen minutes of shooting. After arguing over whether to engage the police in gunfire, the pair decide to count to three and shoot themselves.\n\nOn May 10, a group of youths film themselves going to a park where memorial crosses are standing. They say that Andre and Cal killed twelve people and before also killing themselves. The kids find crosses for the shooters and light them on fire.\n\nIn order of appearance:\n\nBen Coccio recalls that he was in a Brooklyn pizzeria on the day of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, and saw coverage of the event on the eatery's television, commenting, \"I remember thinking that I was surprised that it hadn't happened sooner.\" Coccio was also struck by the extent to which Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold planned that shooting, compared to the impromptu crimes of passion that typified other school shootings. Coccio became eager to address the story in a way that was not exploitative, and drew upon his own views of high school as a place of tension where \"anything could happen at any time\". Coccio's theory of student school shooters is not that they are the most bullied, as such students tend to develop feelings of inferiority and are likely to harm themselves. Coccio feels that shooters tend to be students with feelings of \"superiority\", and that \"when other people don’t confirm that, it really gets under their skin.\"\n\nNone of the numerous Connecticut high schools where he sought to film the movie would allow Coccio access, and he ended up using the interior of a building at State University of New York at Purchase in Purchase, New York. The \"appropriately fortress-like\" exterior of the High School was New Milford High School in New Milford, Connecticut, where Coccio lived at the time.\n\nWhen casting, Coccio inquired at high schools throughout Connecticut looking for teenagers interested in acting who might not have much or any professional experience. Coccio had three days of open auditions. Andre Keuck responded to an ad Coccio placed in Backstage Magazine and brought his classmate and fellow theater enthusiast Cal Robertson along to the audition. Both boys had acted in Shakespeare productions at the Stratford Avon theater in Stratford, Connecticut. They were encouraged to improvise throughout the film's production.\n\n\"Zero Day\" has received mostly positive reviews from critics, currently holding a 68% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 41 critic reviews. Despite the positive reception from critics and audiences, \"Zero Day\" was a box office bomb, gaining only $8,466 against a $20,000 budget.\n\n\n"}

She next collaborated with Robert Aickman, writing three of the six short stories in the collection \"We Are for the Dark\" (1951).\n\nHer second novel, \"The Long View\" (1956), describes a marriage in reverse chronology; Angela Lambert remarked, \"Why \"The Long View\" isn't recognised as one of the great novels of the 20th century I will never know.\" Five further novels followed before she embarked on her best known work, the \"Cazalet Chronicles\", at the suggestion of her stepson Martin Amis.\n\nThe \"Chronicles\" were a family saga \"about the ways in which English life changed during the war years, particularly for women.\" They follow three generations of a middle-class English family and draw heavily on Howard's own life and memories. The first four volumes, \"The Light Years\", \"Marking Time\", \"Confusion\", and \"Casting Off,\" were published from 1990 to 1995. The fifth, \"All Change\", was written in just a year and published in 2013; it was her final novel. Millions of copies of the \"Cazalet Chronicles\" were sold worldwide.\n\n\"The Light Years\" and \"Marking Time\" were serialised by Cinema Verity for BBC Television as \"The Cazalets\" in 2001. A BBC Radio 4 version in 45 episodes was also broadcast from 2012.\n\nHoward wrote the screenplay for the 1989 movie \"Getting It Right\", directed by Randal Kleiser, based on her 1982 novel of the same name, as well as TV scripts for \"Upstairs, Downstairs\".\n\nShe also wrote a book of short stories, \"Mr. Wrong\" (1975), and edited two anthologies, including \"The Lover's Companion\" (1978).\n\nHoward's parents were timber-merchant Major. David Liddon Howard \"MC\" (1896–1958), son of timber-merchant Alexander Liddon Howard (1863-1946), and Katharine Margaret ('Kit') Somervell (1895–1975), a dancer with Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and daughter of the composer Sir Arthur Somervell. (One of her brothers, Colin, lived with her and her third husband, Sir Kingsley Amis, for 17 years.) Privately-educated at home, she later briefly attended Francis Holland School before going on to domestic-science college at Ebury Street and secretarial college in central London.\n\nHoward married Peter Scott in 1942, at age 19, and they had a daughter, Nicola (born 1943). Howard left Scott in 1946 to become a writer, and they were divorced in 1951. At this time she was employed as part-time secretary to the pioneering canals conservation organisation the Inland Waterways Association, where she met and collaborated with Robert Aickman. She had an affair with Aickman, described in her autobiography \"Slipstream\" (2002).\n\nHer second marriage, to Australian broadcaster Jim Douglas-Henry in 1958, was brief. Her third marriage, to novelist Kingsley Amis, whom she met while organising the Cheltenham Literary Festival, lasted from 1965 to 1983; for part of that time, 1968–1976, they lived at Lemmons, a Georgian house in Barnet, where Howard wrote \"Something in Disguise\" (1969). Her stepson, Martin Amis, has credited her with encouraging him to become a more serious reader and writer.\n\nIn later life, she lived in Bungay, Suffolk, and was appointed CBE in 2000. She died at home on 2 January 2014, aged 90.\n\n\nHoward's autobiography, \"Slipstream\", was published in 2002. A biography, entitled \"Elizabeth Jane Howard: A Dangerous Innocence\" by Artemis Cooper, was published by John Murray in 2017.

The picture of this intuitive notion is this:\n\nwhere formula_1 denotes the nominal point, formula_2 denotes the space of all possible values of the object formula_3, and the shaded area, formula_4, represents the set of points that satisfy the stability conditions. The radius of the blue circle, shown in red, is the stability radius.\n\nThe formal definition of this concept varies, depending on the application area. The following abstract definition is quite useful\n\nwhere formula_6 denotes a closed ball of radius formula_7 in formula_2 centered at formula_1.\n\nIt looks like the concept was invented in the early 1960s. In the 1980s it became popular in control theory and optimization. It is widely used as a model of local robustness against small perturbations in a given nominal value of the object of interest.\n\nIt was shown that the stability radius model is an instance of Wald's maximin model. That is,\n\nwhere\n\nThe large penalty (formula_12) is a device to force the formula_13 player not to perturb the nominal value beyond the stability radius of the system. It is an indication that the stability model is a model of local stability/robustness, rather than a global one.\n\nInfo-gap decision theory is a recent non-probabilistic decision theory. It is claimed to be radically different from all current theories of decision under uncertainty. But it has been shown that its robustness model, namely\n\nis actually a stability radius model characterized by a simple stability requirement of the form formula_15 where formula_16 denotes the decision under consideration, formula_17 denotes the parameter of interest, formula_18 denotes the estimate of the true value of formula_17 and formula_20 denotes a ball of radius formula_21 centered at formula_18.\n\nSince stability radius models are designed to deal with small perturbations in the nominal value of a parameter, info-gap's robustness model measures the \"local robustness\" of decisions in the neighborhood of the estimate formula_18.\n\nSniedovich argues that for this reason the theory is unsuitable for the treatment of severe uncertainty characterized by a poor estimate and a vast uncertainty space.\n\nThere are cases where it is more convenient to define the stability radius slightly different. For example, in many applications in control theory the radius of stability is defined as the size of the smallest destabilizing perturbation in the nominal value of the parameter of interest. The picture is this:\n\nMore formally,\n\nwhere formula_25 denotes the \"distance\" of formula_26 from formula_1.\n\nThe stability radius of a continuous function \"f\" (in a functional space \"F\") with respect to an open stability domain \"D\" is the distance between \"f\" and the set of unstable functions (with respect to \"D\"). We say that a function is \"stable\" with respect to \"D\" if its spectrum is in \"D\". Here, the notion of spectrum is defined on a case by case basis, as explained below.\n\nFormally, if we denote the set of stable functions by \"S(D)\" and the stability radius by \"r(f,D)\", then:\nwhere \"C\" is a subset of \"F\".\n\nNote that if \"f\" is already unstable (with respect to \"D\"), then \"r(f,D)=0\" (as long as \"C\" contains zero).\n\nThe notion of stability radius is generally applied to special functions as polynomials (the spectrum is then the roots) and matrices (the spectrum is the eigenvalues). The case where \"C\" is a proper subset of \"F\" permits us to consider structured perturbations (e.g. for a matrix, we could only need perturbations on the last row). It is an interesting measure of robustness, for example in control theory.\n\nLet \"f\" be a (complex) polynomial of degree \"n\", \"C=F\" be the set of polynomials of degree less than (or equal to) \"n\" (which we identify here with the set formula_29 of coefficients). We take for \"D\" the open unit disk, which means we are looking for the distance between a polynomial and the set of Schur stable polynomials. Then:\nwhere \"q\" contains each basis vector (e.g. formula_31 when \"q\" is the usual power basis). This result means that the stability radius is bound with the minimal value that \"f\" reaches on the unit circle.\n\n\n"}

Baxley in his feature film directorial debut, and starring Carl Weathers, Vanity, Craig T. Nelson and Sharon Stone. The film was released in the United States on 12 February 1988.\n\nPaula Abdul was the film choreographer. The film was released by Lorimar Film Entertainment. Vanity was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award as Worst Actress. The film received negative reviews.\n\nThe story prologues with two auto-worker union officials addressing the recent death of a peer. Within moments, both are brutally murdered by a group of shadowy, almost supernatural killers that seem to move, disappear and reappear at will during a daring skyscraper assault.\n\nDetroit Police Department Detective Sergeant Jericho Jackson, known locally as \"Action Jackson\", was a celebrated lieutenant in the police force but demoted (nearly two years before) because of a case he headed involving the criminal son of successful businessman Peter Anthony Dellaplane. The fallout over the case also collapsed Jackson's marriage and put the law-school-educated, star athlete and hometown hero at odds with the public. Even after his demotion, Jackson's continued interest leads to conflicts with his commander, Captain Armbruster, but he begins investigating Dellaplane's professional exploits, eventually uncovering a string of murdered trade-union members connected to Dellaplane's company. He discovers Dellaplane is secretly maneuvering into a \"behind-the-throne\" seat of power, and has been using a group of assassins, \"The Invisible Men\", to murder uncooperative union officials.\n\nJackson is assisted by Dellaplane's mistress, Sydney Ash, a local lounge singer and heroin addict, whom the businessman has assisted financially. He is eventually framed in the murder of Dellaplane's wife Patrice (who was actually killed by her husband, after her discovery of his plot, and her seeking help from Jackson). On the run from the police, Jackson is helped by friends from his old neighborhood:\n\nJackson and Sydney arrange a meeting with Dellaplane's figurehead replacement for the auto union, unaware that The Invisible Men had been tracking them and allowed the meeting so that Dellaplane could confront Jackson face to face. Before he leaves with Sydney in tow, Dellaplane arrogantly reveals the reasoning for his plans and intends to exact it using Jackson as a pawn. He intends to kill Jackson, put one of The Invisible Men in his place, have him kill an important union official, and then have Jackson's charred body discovered after he failed his getaway. \"Dellaplane, one of these days you are really going to piss me off,\" Jackson calls after his nemesis as he leaves with all but three of The Invisible Men. \"We're going to have ourselves a little barbecue,\" Shaker, The Invisible Men's leader claims as they prepare to burn Jackson alive. But Jackson is suddenly rescued by Sydney's bodyguard \"Big\" Edd and the pair battle the Invisible Men. Edd overpowers Birch, knocking him into a control panel, electrocuting him, while Jackson turns the wielding torch they were about to use on him on Thaw, who is killed when the gasoline can he is holding explodes. Shaker opens fire on the pair with his grenade launcher, sending them running for cover.They lure him outside where Edd disarms him and Jackson takes the grenade launcher.(\"Barbecue, huh? How do you like your ribs?\" Jackson asks Shaker before he opens fire, killing him.)\n\nJackson's escape leads to a fight at Dellaplane's mansion during the birthday party for the union leader Dellaplane plans to have assassinated. During the melee, the other members of The Invisible Men are killed by Jackson (who personally deals with the one set to make the kill and frame him), Edd, Jackson's old partner Detective Kotterwell, and a rehabilitated young thief named Albert, with help from Kid Sable. However, Dellaplane takes Sydney hostage and hides inside a bedroom in his mansion. After being given a gun by Kotterwell, Jackson commandeers a car being displayed at the party, crashes into the house, kills Dellaplane's butler/bodyguard, Cartier by ramming him into a wall as the latter fires at him, and roars upstairs to crash into the room Dellaplane is holding Sydney in. After a brief standoff, Dellaplane, (a trained martial artist) challenges Jackson to hand-to-hand combat. At first Dellaplane has the upper hand, but after ramming Jackson into a car window, he is abruptly shoved back by Jackson, who turns and shouts \"Now you've pissed me off!\" Jackson proceeds to thrash Dellaplane. In desperation, Dellaplane goes for his gun, only for Jackson to seize his own and engage in a crossfire exchange, with Jackson killing Dellaplane and receiving a wound in the shoulder in return. Captain Armbruster arrives with reinforcements, informs Jackson that he wants a full report on his desk \"in the morning...\" and calls Jackson \"Lieutenant.\" Sydney soon reveals she plans to go \"cold turkey\" off of heroin, promising Jackson can have her \"on Thanksgiving.\" Jackson replies, \"Can I have you any sooner?\" Sydney giggles and the two kiss passionately as the screen fades to black.\n\nCarl Weathers later called the film:\nA creation that came about when I was doing \"Predator\" and talking to Joel Silver, who loved blaxploitation movies. Joel said, \"Well, you know, why don't you put something together?\" So during that time of shooting down in Puerto Vallarta, I created this story and came up with this guy – or at least this title – Action Jackson. And Joel found a writer [who] wrote the screenplay, and that was it. We got it made.\n\nIn 1990 Weathers starred in \"Dangerous Passion\", an action film, which was released in Germany under the title \"Action Jackson 2\", although it did not relate to the original film.\n\nThe \"Action Jackson\" soundtrack features new music by Sister Sledge, The Pointer Sisters, Vanity, and Herbie Hancock. Vanity's two songs, \"Faraway Eyes\" and \"Undress,\" were produced by musician Jesse Johnson.\n\nWhile successful at the box office, the film received a negative reception from critics.\n\nWeathers said he hoped the film would become a franchise \"but Lorimar sold the lot to Sony and sold the library to Warner Bros., and that was that. It never resurfaced again, unfortunately.\"\n\nThe film received a score of 13% on Rotten Tomatoes from 15 reviews. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 36 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". It grossed $20 million on a $8 million budget, and made another $45 million in VHS sales.\n\nThe film is the subject of the \"Lazor Wulf\" episode, \"Keep It Moving,\" in which the last VHS copy of the film has been stolen, and the main characters attempt to recreate moments they believe are in the film in order to become more like Action Jackson and retrieve the tape.\n\n\n"}

It was first performed Off-Broadway at the Truck and Warehouse Theater where it opened on June 30, 1970, closing on October 18, 1970 after 128 performances. \n\nThis play presents the afterlife as a steam bath, in which recently deceased souls (who may not in every case realize that they are dead) continue to obsess about the same petty concerns that obsessed them in their lives. Ultimately, they are cast into another room offstage which is represented by a dark void by God, the steambath's Puerto Rican attendant, and with the help of his assistant Gottlieb. In the play, the new arrival Tandy at first refuses to accept what's happened, and when he finally does, he pleads to be allowed to return to his life. \"Steambath\" was controversial when first produced for its obscene language (which was softened for its television version), its satirical take on religion, and some brief nudity.\n\nFriedman claims to have been inspired to write the play in part because of a \"bad experience with the food at a Chinese restaurant\" that had him contemplating mortality.\n\nAnthony Perkins directed the original production which starred Perkins as Tandy, Hector Elizondo as the Attendant (God), Marvin Lichterman as Bieberman, Annie Rachel as Meredith, Conrad Bain as Old Timer, Mitchell Jason as Broker, Jere Admire as Young Man, Teno Pollick as 2nd Young Man, Eileen Dietz as Young Girl, Alfred Hinckley as Flanders, Gabor Morea as Gottlieb, Jack Knight as Longshoreman, and William Walsh as 2nd Longshoreman. Miguel Piñero would later play God. Elizondo won an Obie Award for his performance. \n\nInitially Charles Grodin was cast in the role of Tandy, but was replaced by Perkins. Coincidentally, Grodin soon landed his breakthrough role as a comedy actor in the film \"The Heartbreak Kid\", based on a short story by \"Steambath\" author Friedman.\n\nThe play was then produced for PBS in 1973 with playing God, Bill Bixby playing Tandy, and Valerie Perrine as the blonde bombshell Meredith. Only 24 PBS affiliates carried the program.\n\n\"Steambath\" became a series on the cable network Showtime in 1983 starring Robert Picardo in the Tandy role, Janis Ward as Meredith, Al Ruscio as DaVinci, Rita Taggart as Blanche and Allen Williams as Gottlieb. José Pérez reprised his role as God, who now also had a name, \"Morty.\" (A pilot was produced and aired, later followed by five additional episodes.)\n\nAlong with \"Oh! Calcutta!\", the play was spoofed as \"Bathtub\" in \"The Odd Couple\" episode \"What Does a Naked Lady Say to You?\"\n\nIn \"Fame\", Ralph performs an excerpt from \"Steambath\" as part of his audition for the High School of Performing Arts. We do not see the audition itself, only Ralph's introduction: \"I'm God, see? And God is Puerto Rican, you got that? Now, God works in a casa de steam, you know. It's a steam bath, right? . . . I'm God, see? That's why I'm standing on this chair, you got that? Good.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2069009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069009", "title": "Blic", "text": "Blic\n\nBlic (Cyrillic: Блиц, ) is a daily middle-market tabloid newspaper in Serbia. Founded in 1996, \"Blic\" is owned by Ringier Axel Springer Media AG, a joint venture between Ringier media corporation from Switzerland and Axel Springer AG from Germany.\n\nThe initial owners of \"Blic\", Austria-based businessmen Aleksandar Lupšić and Peter Kelbel, sold the paper along with its parent company Blic Press d.o.o. in November 2000 to Gruner + Jahr, a German publishing firm majority-owned by the Bertelsmann conglomerate, right after the October 5th overthrow in Serbia. Initially, G+J bought 49% stake in Blic Press d.o.o., but eventually bought the remaining stake as well.\n\nIn March 2003, Gruner + Jahr sold its 25.1% stake in Blic Press d.o.o. to Vienna Capital Partners (VCP) while retaining the remaining 74.9%.\n\nAfter buying 74.9% stake in Blic Press d.o.o. from Gruner+Jahr in January 2004, Ringier AG assigned Attila Mihók to be the CEO of its new Serbian subsidiary that got renamed Ringier d.o.o. He performed the job until November 2007 and was in July 2008 succeeded by Jelena Drakulić.\n\nIn 2010, when Ringier AG and Axel Springer AG launched a new joint venture Ringier Axel Springer Media AG, \"Blic\" got incorporated among the assets of the newly created joint venture entity while Ringier d.o.o. in Serbia changed its name to Ringier Axel Springer d.o.o.\n\nThe joint Swiss-German entity owns and operates \"Blic\" through its local subsidiary Ringier Axel Springer d.o.o. (formerly \"Blic Press d.o.o.\" and \"Ringier d.o.o.\"), a limited liability company.\n\n\"Blic\" online platforms such as blic.rs, 24sata.rs, and alo.rs are controlled by Ringier Digital AG, which has in July 2014 had its 49% stake bought by KKR, an American private equity firm specializing in leveraged buyouts. KKR thus increased its presence on the Serbian digital media and telecommunications market, having previously in October 2013 bought the majority stake in Serbia Broadband, leading Serbian cable and Internet provider.\n\nSince its founding, \"Blic\" has become a centerpiece of several other publications. They include: \n\nBlic.rs online portal incorporates news content from the \"Blic\" daily as well as from other publications under the Ringer Axel Springer umbrella in Serbia. Since the late 2000s, Blic.rs is among the most visited websites in Serbia, according to Gemius Audience research.\n\nOther online offerings include Alo.rs, 24sata.rs, PulsOnline.rs, SuperOdmor.rs, NonStopShop.rs, MojAuto.rs, and Nekretnine.rs.\n\nThe newspaper was founded in September 1996 by a group of Austria-based businessmen that included Peter Kelbel and Aleksandar Lupšić, who simultaneously bought Bratislava's \"Nový čas\" though the original newspaper had been started a year before (in 1995, as weekly) and had drawn some journalists who had previously been working for Borba and Nasa Borba. At the time of his investment in \"Blic\", Lupšić had strong ties to Milošević's wife Mira Marković and her party Yugoslav Left (JUL). The first issue of \"Blic\" appeared on September 16, 1996 thus becoming the 10th daily newspaper to be published in FR Yugoslavia at the time (the other nine being \"Politika\", \"Borba\", \"Dnevnik\", \"Pobjeda\", \"Narodne novine\", \"Večernje novosti\", \"Politika ekspres\", \"Naša borba\", and \"Dnevni telegraf\").\n\nPrior to that, the same group took over a Prague newspaper where they gained valuable publishing experience which encouraged them to go on further. For their Serbian operation, the owners got seasoned journalist Manojlo \"Manjo\" Vukotić to be the editor-in-chief.\n\nJust like many other media operations in Serbia from the 1990s and beyond, \"Blic\"'s ownership structure was murky as well. It was controlled by an entity called Blic Press d.o.o. - a limited liability company registered in Belgrade in March 1996. Blic Press' owners according to the Serbian Business Register were listed to be Milorad Perovic, a resident of Belgrade (51%) and Liechtenstein-based company named Mitsui Securities Eastern Europe Fund AG (49%) whose owners were not listed.\n\nStarting out, \"Blic\" was a typical stripped-down tabloid with short and simple stories, as well as a lot of entertainment content. Its first issues were circulated in 50,000 copies per day with the price set at 1 dinar. It also ran a heavily advertised sweepstakes with the grand prize being a Volkswagen Polo Classic car and DM30,000. As a result of the sweepstakes, the paper's circulation increased by 30% within only a couple of weeks of the first issue.\n\nIn November 1996, local municipal elections were held across Serbia. The opposition, headed by the DS and SPO, parties made big gains at the expense of Milošević's Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). Milošević refused to recognize the results, thus sparking a huge outpouring of street protests. \"Blic\" capitalized on this to further its position on the market through fair coverage of the events ignored by the government-controlled media. The decision turned out to be a business winner in the short term as circulation rapidly grew to 200,000 copies a day, but it also drew the ire of the Milošević authorities.\n\nIn the circumstances when state media made virtually no mention of the protests and the reporting of the independent media was insufficient on the subject, \"Blic\" made a gutsy decision to devote a sizable part of its paper every day to the protests. The government responded immediately by restricting \"Blic\"'s access to print and distribution facilities as the state printing house refused to print any more than 80,000 copies of the paper. The problem first appeared when it came time to print the 29 November 1996 holiday 4-day issue (FR Yugoslavia at the time still celebrated the old SFR Yugoslavia's day of the republic) as the state-owned Borba printing facility informed \"Blic\" staff that it's not able to print the holiday issue in the requested 235,000 copies \"due to technical reasons\" and instead offered to print about a third of that. The holiday issue still appeared on newsstands in projected circulation as some of it got printed at Borba and the rest in privately owned ABC Produkt. However, the issue that appeared was a complete whitewash, abandoning the paper's new concept and going back to entertainment and frivolity. Forty three journalists employed at \"Blic\" immediately publicly distanced themselves from the issue, and editor-in-chief Manjo Vukotić and his deputy Cvijetin Milivojević resigned in protest.\n\nThe most controversial part of the issue was the pro-government op-ed piece under the headline \"Nećemo da podstičemo nasilje\" (We won't encourage violence) signed by Peter Kelbel who wrote it claiming to represent the paper's owners. In the piece he criticizes the protesters and indirectly supports the government, saying among other things that \"Yugoslavia needs creative people and not wolves who follow the alpha wolf and hunt in packs\" - a veiled reference to opposition leader Vuk Drašković whose first name Vuk translates to \"wolf\". Clearly, since certain influential individuals within the state apparatus were unhappy with the paper's reporting, \"Blic\" made guarantees to decrease reporting on the protests and to decrease circulation for the time being. \"Blic\" publishers caved in under state pressure and drastically reduced the number of political pages.\n\n\"Blic\" owners faced a lot of criticism over their decision to give in to the authorities. The move was criticized by many of its journalists and editors along with the Serbian opposition. As a response, in December 1996, the journalists and editors formed their own newspaper \"Demokratija\" that had the support of opposition Democratic Party (DS). Still, Vukotić and many of the staffers that originally distanced themselves from the paper returned to \"Blic\" shortly and for a few months put out a stripped-down version of the paper with only 60,000 copies printed each day.\n\nAll in all, as a result of the unsavory episode, \"Blic\" quickly lost half its circulation, as well as many of its journalistic staff who resigned in protest.\n\n\"Blic\" then contracted a new printing house, resumed a critical line and soon increased its circulation to nearly 160,000.\n\nIn April 1998, \"Blic\" experienced another fragmentation of its staff when due to disagreements with owner Aca Lupšić over revenue sharing, editor-in-chief Manjo Vukotić decided to step out on his own. Majority of the staff followed him. They then hooked up with another businessman Radisav Rodić (owner of the printing company ABC Produkt that printed daily issues of \"Blic\" and its offshoots) and under his financial backing started a new paper called \"Glas javnosti\" (the first five issues were called \"Novi Blic\"). Rodić thus entered the world of newspaper publishing.\n\nIn November 2000, shortly after the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević in Serbia, German publishing firm Gruner + Jahr announced its purchase of 49% stake in Blic Press d.o.o. from Aca Lupšić and his partners. At the time of the transaction, the paper's circulation was announced to be 175,000 copies daily.\n\n\"Blic\" got sold to Swiss multimedia communications group Ringier in early 2004 (takeover finalized in October 2004).\n\nIn early 2006, \"Blic\" created a storm of controversy by claiming in its 4 February 2006 issue that the 11 January arrest of Dejan Simić, National Bank of Serbia vice-governor (who was taken in red-handed at his apartment while accepting a €100,000 bribe from Vladimir Zagrađanin of SPS), actually had a completely different background from what the police and Serbian government authorities told the public. The newspaper alleged that Dušan Lalić, an NBS employee and deputy PM Miroljub Labus' son-in-law, was actually the individual behind the bribing. The story further alleged that deputy PM Labus spent an entire night convincing Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica not to prosecute his son-in-law.\n\nAnd finally, the story also accused Serbian Interior Minister Dragan Jočić of stopping the police investigation from climbing up the chain of command and thus preventing the arrests of NBS governor Radovan Jelašić and the above-mentioned Dušan Lalić, as well as SPS' Ivica Dačić who was present in the mentioned apartment minutes before the police stormed in. The paper voiced its fear that the minority coalition government, which held a shaky 5-seat parliamentary support at the time, would fall as Jočić's motivation for disrupting the thorough police action.\n\nAll of the parties concerned (Labus, Lalić, Jočić, Jelašić, and Dačić) vehemently rubbished the story, with Labus announcing immediate legal action against \"Blic\" for libel.\n\nIn March 2007, the parent company announced \"Blic\"'s average daily circulation during the 2006 calendar year to be 180,948.\n\nOn July 27, 2009, \"Blic\" published an interview with Ratko Knežević, former Montenegrin trade representative in Washington, D.C. and former close friend of Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Đukanović (Knežević was the best man at Đukanović's wedding). The \"Blic\" interview came couple of days after Knežević gave a similarly explosive interview to Montenegrin daily \"Vijesti\" in which he effectively accused Đukanović and his associate Stanko Subotić of ordering the October 2008 murder of Croatian journalist Ivo Pukanić. Knežević also provided many alleged details of the decades-long cigarette smuggling operation, Đukanović had been involved in.\n\nConducted by journalist Nenad Jaćimović, the focus of the \"Blic\" interview was on cigarette smuggling operations through Serbia during the 1990s and its political fallout that continues to this day. In the interview, Knežević accused Đukanović, Subotić and their \"cigarette smuggling cartel\" of defrauding the Serbian budget of €300 million in unpaid taxes with the help of Jovica Stanišić, Serbian former state security chief and Milošević's second in command. Knežević further alleged that since the regime change in Serbia, Đukanović and Subotić needed a \"friendly\" government in Belgrade and to that end tried their best for years to reach a deal with Serbian president Boris Tadić and his circle. After allegedly getting nowhere with Tadić, according to Knežević, they then turned their attention to other players on the Serbian political scene such as Tomislav Nikolić and Aleksandar Vučić who met with Đukanović and Subotić during October 2007 in Paris' Ritz Hotel. Furthermore, according to Knežević, for this Đukanović and Subotić had the support of former DGSE intelligence operative Arnaud Danjean. Knežević also claimed that the cigarette cartel also poses a security threat to Boris Tadić and that even Croatian president Stipe Mesić gave Tadić documents during their meeting in Sofia on April 25, 2009 warning him of possible attacks on him.\n\nSubotić announced that he would sue \"Blic\" for libel. After Subotić wrote a press release that was distributed in Balkan print media outlets on August 11, 2009, in which he denies Knežević's charges and further questions Knežević's and \"Blic\" editor-in-chief Veselin Simonović's professional and moral credibility, Knežević wrote a lengthy response saying that he stands by every word from his \"Vijesti\", \"Blic\" and \"NIN\" interviews. In the same response, Knežević also provided further details of the murders of Radovan \"Badža\" Stojičić, Jusuf \"Jusa\" Bulić, Vanja Bokan, Goran Žugić, Darko \"Beli\" Raspopović, and Blagota \"Baja\" Sekulić (all of which he claimed are connected to cigarette smuggling with the murders of Stojičić, Bulić, and Bokan directly ordered and approved by Stanišić, Subotić, and Đukanović) by directly naming the individuals that carried them out as well as those that ordered them.\n\n\n\n"}

It is signed as Lake Mead Boulevard and runs from Interstate 15 (I-15) and U.S. Route 93 (US 93) in North Las Vegas east to the border of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. It is not to be confused with Lake Mead Parkway (formerly Lake Mead Drive), which also goes to Lake Mead but mainly runs in southern Las Vegas Valley and carries the designation of State Route 564.\n\nLake Mead Boulevard became a state highway in 1978, but the highway never had markers posted to identify it as a state highway.\n\nState Route 147 begins at Interstate 15 and U.S. Route 93 in North Las Vegas. From there, SR 147 has an intersection at Las Vegas Boulevard (SR 604) and Civic Center Drive (former SR 607). Traveling further east, SR 147 leaves the city of North Las Vegas as it enters the unincorporated town of Sunrise Manor where it has intersections at Lamb Boulevard and Nellis Boulevard (SR 612). The highway then leaves the unincorporated town of Sunrise Manor as it travels through the Frenchman Mountain on its northern slope. The road then curves into a southeastern direction where the highway ends near the Lake Mead NRA as Lake Mead Boulevard continues beyond the highway's eastern terminus.\n\nSR 147 first appears on the official Nevada state highway map with the 1978-79 edition as a semi-circular route. The route followed Lake Mead Boulevard (which was previously unnumbered) eastward from North Las Vegas to North Shore Road in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area; south on North Shore Road (replacing SR 41A) to Lakeshore Road; then west on Lakeshore Road (later Lake Mead Drive, now Lake Mead Parkway), replacing part of SR 41. The terminus was at Lakeshore Road and Boulder Highway (then US 93/US 95, now SR 582). The highway continued west of Boulder Highway as SR 146.\n\nThe northern section along Lake Mead Boulevard lacks the SR 147 designator on the 1983–84 and 1985-86 maps. However, it is back on the 1987-88 map, so it is unclear whether this was a map error or possibly a planned decommissioning that wasn’t carried out.\n\nOn the 1998-99 map, the southern section of SR 147 (along Lake Mead Drive) was replaced by an eastward extension of SR 146 (now SR 564). The entire length of SR 147 is now on Lake Mead Boulevard, with the eastern terminus truncated to the northern border of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area.\n\nRTC Transit Route 210 functions on this road.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2069026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069026", "title": "Santi Asoke", "text": "Santi Asoke\n\nThe Santi Asoke ( \"Peaceful Ashoka\") was established by a former television entertainer and songwriter Phra Bodhirak after he \"declared independence from the Ecclesiastical Council in 1975\". He had originally ordained within a monastery recognized by the Thai Sangha, but soon left with a small following to form this group, which he sees as a mixture of both Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism. Described by Donald Swearer as \"a radical sectarian movement\" that \"reflects the forest tradition's ideals of simplicity\", the tradition also claimed an early influence from Buddhadasa, which it later rejected.\n\nSamana Phothirak was once a bhikkhu of Dhammayuttika Nikaya, but his preceptor refused to take care of him after finding he had repeatedly breached the Buddhist doctrines. Phothirak then resorted to Maha Nikaya at Wat Nong Krathum (), Nakhon Pathom Province. As he still repeatedly contravened the doctrines, the community of Thai monks requested the Supreme Sangha Council (SSC) to look into the case. Several inquisitorial panels were set up to investigate the monks' complaints and a decision was made that the SSC should exercise the authority under the Sangha Act, BE 2505 (1962), section 27, to defrock Phothirak. On June 10, 1989, Ariyavangsagatayana, 18th Supreme Patriarch of Thailand and SSC President, commanded Phothirak to leave order within seven days.\n\nSano Phuangphinyo (), Deputy Director General of the Department of Religious Affairs, Ministry of Education, notified Phothirak of the command in person, but Phothirak refused to observe it and declared his secession from the Sangha. He then formed Asoke and established four monasteries: (1) Santi Asoke Monastery at Khet Bang Kapi, Bangkok; (2) Si Asok Monastery at Kantharalak District, Sisaket Province; (3) Sali Asok Monastery at Phaisali District, Nakhon Sawan Province; and (4) Phathomma Asok Monastery at Mueang Nakhon Pathom District, Nakhon Pathom Province. The monasteries consist of temples, pavilions and parsonages as on a par with wats.\n\nThe Asoke accepted to perform ordination for those wishing to be Buddhist monks, despite the fact that it was not authorised by the laws or Buddhist disciplines to do so. At that time, more than 100 men and women were ordained by Phothirak. Phothirak also enacted his own disciplines, called \"Rules for Asoke Followers.\" Phothirak followers, whom Phothirak considered as legitimate Buddhist monks and nuns, wore the same robes as the Buddhist monks.\n\nDeputy Director General Phuangphinyo then filed a complaint before the Lat Phrao Metropolitan Police, and the warrants of arrest were issued for Phothirak and his 104 followers. They were arrested on August 8, 1989, and 80 prosecutions were then instituted against them before the Northern Phra Nakhon Municipal Court. The court found that the 1st-79th Defendants (Phothirak followers) were guilty of the religious offenses under the Criminal Code, section 208 (not being a Buddhist monk, but dressing up as a Buddhist monk in order to deceive another into believing that the offender is a Buddhist monk), and sentenced each of them to imprisonment for 3 months. The 80th Defendant (Phothirak himself) was found guilty of aiding in the commission of the said criminal acts on 33 counts, and was sentenced to serve two months on each count consecutively; he was imprisoned for 66 months in total. The judgment was later affirmed by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Justice. The latter court decided on June 15, 1998, that:\n\nThe fact that the 80th Defendant has been ordained as a monk of Thammayutika Nikai Sect...and...later, a monk of Maha Nikai Sect, indicates his agreement to comply with the Sangha Act, BE 2505 (1962), and the regulations of the Supreme Sangha Council. And at that time, the 80th Defendant was capable of observing the said laws, and it did not appear that he was persecuted or otherwise debarred from following the Buddhist disciplines. As the Court has decided that...no legal provision allows a Thai monk to refuse to be subject to the Sangha Act, BE 2505 (1962), the declaration of the 80th Defendant and his followers to secede from the administration of the Supreme Sangha Council and not to observe the said Act therefore brings about a schism amongst the Buddhist Community. Being a priest, that is, an upholder of morals, but refusing to comply with the laws would definitely cause unrest as in this Case.\n\nAsoke later turns to play a part in politics. Phothirak has taken part in several anti-government protests, including that of the Yellow Shirts against Samak Sundaravej in 2008.\n\n\n\n"}

The earliest hymns are those of the founder, Raimundo Irineu Serra - 'Mestre Irineu'. While the rituals and music originated with a very few hymns, sung by a small group in the Brazilian Amazon, the practice of these spiritual works in diverse parts of the world since it began expansion around the beginning of the 1990s has given rise to a significant body of music, in many languages. Daimistas from Brazil and other countries have contributed to this growing genre, while continuing to sing the principle hinarios in Portuguese. \n\nAmong adherents to the doctrine, songs tend to be referred to as 'received' from a spiritual source rather than written from the writers mind alone and confirmed by their use in ritual. Variously these hymns may be viewed as 'calling' energies or divine entities, as transmitting sacred doctrine, as bringing healing through the act of singing what the community is affirming are eternal truths. In the spiritual works and communities of Santo Daime, the hymns are a bond of shared understanding and a daily practice. New hymns are often introduced in ceremony by those who receive them, by the leader's invitation.\n\nA Santo Daime hinário (Portuguese) or \"hymn-book (hinario)\", can be a life work of its owner, chronicling that person's spiritual journey. During a ritual, one or several hinários or compilations may be sung in their entirety. While they are sung outside of the rituals in ensaio (practice) and listened to in various settings, the real distinction of is genre is that it is intended to be sung in ritual, by a group going into what is understood to be spiritual work of transformation. The hymns can be seen as integral to the ritual, the transformation, and the revealed messages as each person understands them. Hinarios that are central to the doctrine may be sung once or several times per year, and practiced many times more.\n\nMestre Irineu on the Virgin of Conception (Dec. 7), Christmas, Day of Kings (January 6), St. John (June 23). The hinario of Padrinho Sebastiao is sung on Irineu's birthday (Dec. 15), Saint Sebastian (January 19), Madrinha Rita's birthday (June 25), as well as Brazilian Father's Day. Padrinho Alfredo's hinario is sung on Padrinho Alfredo's birthday (January 7), St. Joseph (March 18), and Saint Peter (June 28), as well as New Year's Eve (December 31)\n\n'O Cruzeiro' (The Cross), 'Cruzeirinho' (The Little Cross) and 'A Santa Missa' (The Holy Mass)\n\nThe first part of Mestre Irineu's hinário, O Cruzeiro, contains hymns up to number 116. After an interval of 11 years he received hymns 117 through 128, which are now known as the Cruzeirinho or occasionally as the \"Hinos Novos\". After the time of Mestre Irineu it became a more common practice to finish or close an hinario as a complete work, after which a new hinario might be received.\n\n'O Justiceiro' and 'Nova Jerusalem' (The New Jerusalem)\n\nNova Jerusalem is the second and final hinario of Padrinho Sebastião, consisting of 26 hymns. \n\n'Lua Branca' (White Moon)\n\nRita Gregório de Melo is the widow of Padrinho Sebastião, matriarch of the CEFLURIS line, mother of 11 children, and lives in Céu do Mapiá. She is thought to have been born 25 June 1925 in Rio Grande do Norte.\n\n'O Convite' (The Invitation)\n\nJúlia Gregório da Silva was born in Açu, Rio Grande do Norte, in 1933. She was the younger sister of Madrinha Rita, and the mother of six children.\n\n'A Mensagem' (The Message)\n\nCristina Raulino da Silva was born in Rio Branco, Acre, in 1938. She married Manuel Gregório (Padrinho Nel), the brother of Madrinha Rita.\n\n'O Cruzerinho', 'Nova Era' (The New Age) and 'Nova Dimensão' \n\nNova Dimensão is the third (yet to be completed) hinario of Padrinho Alfredo.\n\nAlfredo Gregório de Melo, one of the sons of Padrinho Sebastião and Madrinha Rita, today heads the CEFLURIS line which Padrinho Sebastião founded, based in Céu do Mapiá, Amazonas. He was born 7 January 1950 in the seringal (rubber extraction area) Adélia along the Juruá river in the state of Amazonas.\n\nJoão Pedro was a contemporary of Mestre Irineu. All we know is that his strong, healing hinário only became known to Santo Daime after his death.\n\n'O Mensageiro' (The Messenger)\n\nMaria Marques Vieira was born in Belém do Pará, in 1917. She was very young when she moved with her family to Rio Branco, Acre, where she met Mestre Irineu, in the early 1930s. She was sallow and blond with white skin. Maria Damião, as she was known, married and had seven children (one adopted) but lost her husband early. She worked hard to support her family but had many difficulties in her material life, as in her works with Santo Daime. She died of pneumonia, aged just 32 years, on 2 April 1949.\n\n'O Amor Divino' (The Divine Love)\n\nAntônio Gomes da Silva was born in Ceará, 30 April 1885. He married Maria de Nazaré in Ceará, and had five children. He lived in Belém do Pará for a while, and then moved to Rio Branco, Acre, in 1921. He worked as a seringueiro, or rubber tapper, and later as a farmer. He lost his first wife, married again, and had another four children. He met Mestre Irineu in 1938, and he received benefits for his unstable health. Antônio Gomes then became a member of the Santo Daime doctrine, as did his whole family. His son Leôncio became the new leader of Alto Santo, after Mestre Irineu's death, in 1971. His granddaughter, Peregrina Gomes, was the third wife of Mestre Irineu. Antônio Gomes da Silva died 14 August 1946.\n\n'Vós Sois Baliza' (Thou art a Beacon)\n\nGermano Guilherme dos Santos was born in Piauí at the beginning of the 20th century. He moved with his family to Rio Branco, Acre, where he lived on the outskirts of the city working as a farmer. Germano was one of the first disciples of Mestre Irineu, becoming a member of Santo Daime in the 1930s. He was a black man with notably white teeth. Germano had special feelings for Mestre Irineu, and called him maninho, or 'my little brother'. He suffered a disease on his leg that bothered him a lot. Because of this, he couldn't eat some kinds of food. But when he was at maninho's house, Germano ate everything he wanted and didn't feel anything. He was married to Cecília Gomes, the daughter of Antônio Gomes and Maria de Nazaré, but had no children. His hinário is sung at CICLU - Alto Santo along with the O Cruzeiro hinário of Mestre Irineu. Germano Guilherme dos Santos died in 1964.\n\n'Seis de Janeiro' (January 6; which is King's day, or Epiphany)\n\nJoão Pereira was born in Porongaba, Ceará, in the end of the 19th century. Nobody knows the date he moved to Rio Branco, Acre. In the early 1930s, he joined Mestre Irineu, and became one of his first disciples. João Pereira was almost bald, and his complexion was swarthy or similar to that of caboclos, the mixed blood people of the Amazonian region. He worked as a farmer and wagon driver. He lived near Rio Branco and was married with Maria Franco (Maria Marques Feitosa), the mother of the second wife of Mestre Irineu, Raimunda. João Pereira died in 1954.\n\nAfter Mestre Irineu passed on, his last wife's uncle Leôncio Gomes assumed command of the works, and in turn after Leôncio Gomes' passing, Francisco Fernandes Filho (Tetéu or Teteo) took over; however, he apparently very soon quarreled with Mestre Irineu's widow, Dona Peregrina Gomes Serra, and was chased out of Mestre Irineu's house (Alto Santo), according to Edward MacRae. Tetéu then founded a new center less than a kilometer away, declaring himself to be the real CICLU. Following Sr. Luis Mendes' presidency, Tetéu's eventual successor, Mr. João Rodrigues Facundes (who was also involved in the initial dispute), returned the legal name and charter of CICLU to Dona Peregrina. \n\nKnown for sleeping light and little, Tetéu received his nickname after a bird (\"Vanellus chilensis\") commonly called \"Tetéu\" who was also believed to not sleep much. His hinario \"O Assesor\" has 132 hymns, including a number of Daime serving hymns (Eu Tomo Daime, O Daime Me Balançou, Mesa De Centro, Daime é O Nosso Pai, Um, Dois E Três) and is sung in some churches, where it is known, to honor the passing of Mestre Irineu on July 6. Where it is not known well, Mestre Irineu's hinario \"O Cruzeiro,\" is sung (a Capella in the churches of Sr. Luis Mendes). \n\nMaria Brilhante was married with Padrinho Eduardo Salles Freitas, and they had four children, three of whom survive. Madrinha Maria Brilhante received a hinário which is officially sung on the festival of St. Anthony every 12-13 June.\n\n'Guia Mestre' (Master Guide), 'Mensageiros da Cura' (Messengers of Healing),\n'Hinário da Fé' (Hinario of the Faith), 'Estrela D'Água' (Star of the Water. Baixinha's new hinario)\n\nBaixinha, \"tiny\" in Portuguese, is perhaps the best known practitioner of UmbanDaime. She is a small woman of scarcely one and a half meters, who has spent more than forty years in Umbanda, twenty-one in Candomblé, and eighteen years in Santo Daime. Despite her small stature, she was known by many as a true spiritual beacon and traveled extensively, even after she'd become very old. She led a spiritual community in Lumiar, a mountain village two hours from Rio de Janeiro until her passage in 2015 working in two worlds (spiritual and physical) and two doctrines (Daimista and Umbandista).\n\n'O Chaveirinho' & 'O Chaveirão'\n\nHinário received by prominent cartoonist Glauco Villas Boas (March 10, 1957 - March 12, 2010), commander of the Céu de Maria church in São Paulo, and consisting of 41 hymns in O Chaveirinho and 11 in O Chaveirão. \n\nGlauco came from a family of legends, and became a legend in his own right. As one of the most recognizable and timely artists of Brazil in the late 20th century, he formed a bond with fellow cartoonists Laerte and Angeli that produced a significant, massive body of work over decades. As daily political cartoonist for Folha de São Paulo (Sao Paulo's principal daily newspaper), he was looked to by Paulistas to interpret and shed light on the news of the day in his own courageous, take-no-prisoners style. \n\nWhile participating in early works at Flor das Aguas in Itapecerica da Serra (SP), Glauco inaugurated Ceu de Maria in his own home, then built a church on a peak high above Sao Paulo called Pico do Jaraguá. An accomplished musician, he was well known for his fiery accordion playing and said that he had never once practiced outside of ceremony, relying instead on the force of the Daime to pull the music.\n\n'Nova Anunciação'\n\nAlex Polari spent years as a political prisoner during the rule of the military junta in Brazil, enduring torture, brutality, and deprivation. His quest for spiritual initiation eventually led him deep into the heart of the rainforest, to Mapiá, where he became a teacher and leader of the Santo Daime community. He is the author of 'Forest of Visions: Ayahuasca, Amazonian Spirituality, and the Santo Daime Tradition' which has been translated into English.\n\nLuz na Escuridão (A Light In The Darkness) is the hinário received by Paulo Roberto (Paulo Roberto Silva e Souza), padrinho of the Céu do Mar church in Rio de Janeiro, and who is a psychologist by training.\n\nOração simply means prayer. In Daimista communities and households, it is normally sung around 6:30pm, in church or at home, with or without instruments. The oração of CEFLURIS consists of a selection of 12 hymns from Padrinho Sebastião's O Justiceiro hinário (or hymnbook), plus one from his son Padrinho Alfredo's O Cruzeirinho hinário, and a new one from Sebastião's daughter Madrinha Nonata.\n\nThe Cura is a selection of 32 healing hymns in two parts, taken mainly from the hinários of Padrinho Sebastião, Madrinha Rita, and Padrinho Alfredo, but also including a few from Mestre Irineu, Alex Polari, Vera Froes and Madrinha Tetê (Teresa Gregório), often used on occasions when healing is required, in particular physical healing.\n\nFinados is a compendium of the hinarios of Antonio Gomes, Maria Damião, Germano Guilherme and João Pereira, among the earliest followers of Mestre Irineu.\n\n"}

He was then succeeded by Jose N. Pajeta Jr, the town's vice mayor during that time.\n\nThe name Agno was derived from a species of swamp tree called “Agno Casto”, a chaste tree used for medicinal concoctions to relieve pain and illness, that grew abundantly in the locality. In time, “Agno” was retained to become the name of the town.\n\nAgno was formally organized into municipality in 1791. During the Spanish regime and early part of the American era, Agno was part of the Province of Zambales, but upon enactment of Public Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903, of the Philippine Commission, the northern part of Zambales including Agno was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan.\n\nAgno is politically subdivided into 17 barangays.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality was named after Spanish governor-general Rafael María de Aguilar, who ordered the establishment of an independent civil political unit on 16 July 1805.\n\nThe Municipality of Aguilar had its early beginnings as cattle ranch founded by the Spaniards. The place was known then as Sitio Balubad, which was then still part of the town of Binalatongan (now San Carlos). On the western part were the Zambales Mountains with thick forests and verdant foliage. It was hunter's paradise with deer roaming here and there with an occasional wild boar making an appearance. The grass in the plains were succulent fare for fattening cattle and the water from the brooks and streams clear and sparkling.\nOn the eastern part was the Agno River. At that time, there were no roads were yet established. There were footpaths which eventually roads providing access from one place to another. The river arteries constituted the main mode of transportation in the interior towns. Through these river systems, boats sailed from the Ilocos provinces in the North southwards to Dagupan, Calasiao, Lingayen and sometimes even as far as San Isidro De Labrador, Salasa, Aguilar and Camiling. Worth noting was the fossiliferous river bank in Camiling useful in making lime, while mineral waters consisting of ferruginous and alkaline waters were and are still found in Aguilar and Mangatarem.\nAs a thriving place for cattle and bountiful rice harvests, it was natural for Aguilar to attract people from other towns to stay and settle in the place.\nThe early settlers prospered and lived in peace and contentment. When the Spaniards in Lingayen heard of this flourishing village, they sent Spanish explorers through the town of Salasa to visit the place. Some Spanish soldiers and priest were left to organize a pueblo. In time, the clamor to convert the settlement into a town became popular. A petition was therefore, filed with the principales or municipal officials of Binalatongan to convert the village into a town. The petition was finally favorably endorsed.\n\nThe decree establishing Aguilar as an independent civil political unit was issued on 16 July 1805 by Governor General Rafael Maria de Aguilar, after whom the town was named. The decree in Lingayen on 1 August 1805. However, it was not until 19 January 1806 that the Provincial Governor of Pangasinan was able to make the trip to the sitio of Balubad, the site of the Poblacion, to carry out the provisions of the decree.\nThe Governor inspected the area, chose the most appropriate site on which to erect the town center and listed the people who wishes to settle in the new town, together with their places of origin. The greatest number came from Lingayen, made up of 210 couples and 60 individuals from the \"gremio de naturals\" (native community) and 10 couples and 11 individuals from the \"gremio de mestizos\" (mestizo community). From the town of Salasa, there were 56 couples and 21 bachelors all of the rank of \"Caylianes\" (commoners), while from the town of San Carlos, there were 32 couples and 19 individuals, all \"Caylianes\". There were also Ilocano migrants consisting of 6 couples and 24 bachelors. Finally, there were some Negritos, consisting of both baptized Christians and Ynfieles (Non-Christians). All in all, the total number of inhabitants composed 401 tributes, for bachelors and unmarried women paid only half a tribute each. These excluded the unbaptized negritos.\nThe town was formally inaugurated on 9 May 1806 when the first officials were elected and given their appointments by the Alcalde Mayor. The officials were headed by Don Francisco Zamuco as Gobernadorcillo and Don Juan Manguino as \"Teniente Primero\" (first lieutenant). The Alcalde Mayor then proceeded to mark the jurisdictional limits of the new town. With the town of Salasa, the boundary was the river Balubad (now Sobol) from the mountain where the river originated to the river Agno, running a direct line from west to east. With the town of San Carlos, the boundary was the Agno River in the east and the Bunlalacao River in the south. The necessary boundary markers were placed and operations were witnessed by the town officials of Salasa and San Carlos. Mangatarem as a town did not yet exist, having been founded only in 1837. Local folklores likewise maintained that Aguilar was identified with an eagle or agila that used to fly around the place at nighttime and would perch on a fence or alar when tired of flying, hence, agila and alar put together formed Aguilar.\n\nAlthough the population of Aguilar was drawn from different places, the leadership of the town was furnished by the elite families, the principales who had moved from Lingayen to Aguilar in 1805. Aguilar also had a large number of Ilocano migrants among the population. Their tributes in fact contributed to the political viability of the new town. But in all these new towns, the initiative for and leadership in building the new town came from the Pangasinan native-born elite.\n\nThe Gobernadorcillo usually took charge of public works and improvements in the town. This included the building and repair of public structures, including churches and convents, as well as construction and repair of roads and bridges under the parish curate's supervision. For this purpose, the services of Caylianes were utilized. They were required to render 40 days of labor or Polos a year.\nThe Gobernadorcillo also had to procure building materials from the town if possible; if not he had to send a request for approval to the Superior Government in Manila through Alcalde Mayor. He must also keep clean and sanitary the casa tribunal and the public jail.\n\nAguilar is politically subdivided into 16 barangays.\n\nBecause of the majority of vast farmlands in Aguilar, The major crops planted in the municipality are Rice, Corn, Vegetables, Mangoes, Luffas and other crops. Aguilar is also engages in Poultry and Livestock Raising including Cows, Pigs, Carabaos, Goats, Chickens and Domestic Ducks. Tourism is also a booming industry in the municipality due to the sudden growth of tourists visiting; due to this, various resorts has been established in various locations.\n\nThere are many tourist spots in Aguilar, some of which are:\n\nHigh Schools:\n\nElementary Schools:\nPrivate Schools:\n\n"}

{"id": "2069041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069041", "title": "Brefeldin A", "text": "Brefeldin A\n\nBrefeldin A is a lactone antiviral produced by the fungus \"Penicillium brefeldianum\". Brefeldin A inhibits protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi complex indirectly by preventing association of COP-I coat to the Golgi membrane. Brefeldin A was initially isolated with hopes to become an antiviral drug but is now primarily used in research to study protein transport.\n\nThe compound gets its name from a species of anamorph fungus of the \"Penicillium\" genus known as \"Eupenicillium brefeldianum\", though it is found in a variety of species that span several genera. It was first isolated from \"Penicillium decumbens\" in 1958 by V.L. Singleton who initially called it Decumbin. It was later identified as a metabolite by H.P. Siggs who then went on to identify the chemical structure of the compound in 1971. Since then several successful total synthesis methods have been described. Interest in researching brefeldin A was initially lacking due to poor antiviral activity. However, upon discovery of its mechanism involving disruption of protein transport by Takatsuki and Tamura in 1985 and the cytotoxic effects observed in certain cancer cell lines, research efforts were revitalized. It is currently used solely in research mainly as an assay tool for studying membrane traffic and vesicle transport dynamics between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.\n\nBrefeldin A is found naturally as a white to off-white crystalline solid. It forms a clear colorless solution when dissolved. It is soluble in methanol (10 mg/mL), ethanol (5 mg/mL), DMSO (20 mg/mL), acetone, and ethyl acetate (1 mg/mL) without the aid of heating. It is poorly soluble in water (slightly miscible). It is sold commercially with a purity of 98% or greater. It is recommended that it be stored desiccate at -20 °C away from direct sunlight. Its suggested shelf life for use is 6 months as a solid and 1 month as a solution with tightly sealed storage at -20 °C. Since the compound is combustible, contamination with oxidizing agents should be avoided to prevent the risk of fire. Direct contact should be avoided as well.\n\nIn mammalian and yeast cells, the main target of brefeldin A appears to be a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) called GBF1. GBF1 is a member of the Arf family of GEFs which are recruited to membranes of the Golgi. It is responsible for the regulation of Arf1p GTPase. It does this through converting the inactive GDP-bound form of Arf1p to the active GTP-bound form. The nucleotide exchange occurs at the catalytic Sec7 domain of GBF1. Activated Arf1p then recruits coat protein β-COP, a subunit of the COP-I complex, to cargo-bound receptors on the membrane. Coat protein recruitment is necessary for proper vesicle formation and transport. Brefeldin A reversibly inhibits the function of GBF1 uncompetitively by binding to the complex it forms with GDP-bound Arf1p and preventing conversion to the GTP-bound form. The lack of active Arf1p prevents coat protein recruitment, which then ultimately induces the fusion of neighboring ER and Golgi membranes due to lack of vesicle formation. This is because lack of vesicle formation results in a buildup of SNARE proteins in the Golgi which would otherwise be bound to coat protein-coated vesicles and removed with the vesicles once they bud off. SNARE proteins mediate membrane fusion and it is postulated that the described SNARE build up in the Golgi increases the chances of aberrant fusion of the Golgi membrane with that of the ER. The collapse of the Golgi into the ER triggers activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) (or ER stress) which can result in apoptosis.\n\nThe toxological effects of brefeldin A have not been studied extensively yet. Some animal LD values have been reported including 250 mg/kg in mice (interperitoneal) and 275 mg/kg in rats (oral). Generally, antibiotic macrolides that share a similar macrocyclic lactone ring to that of brefeldin A have been shown to produce gastrointestinal discomfort as the most common side effect. Some macrolides have been shown to produce allergic reactions and though uncommon this possibility in the case of brefeldin A cannot be disregarded as of yet. The compound may bind to hemoglobin and inhibit oxygen uptake resulting in methemoglobinemia, a form of oxygen starvation, though this is not confirmed. Brefeldin A is not considered to be harmful from direct skin or eye exposure other than transient irritation. It may cause irritation of the respiratory system if inhaled.\n\n\n"}

This reaction is named after Erik Christian Clemmensen, a Danish chemist.\n\nThe original Clemmensen reduction conditions are particularly effective at reducing aryl-alkyl ketones, such as those formed in a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The two-step sequence of Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by Clemmensen reduction constitutes a classical strategy for the primary alkylation of arenes. With aliphatic or cyclic ketones, modified Clemmensen conditions using activated zinc dust in an anhydrous solution of hydrogen chloride in diethyl ether or acetic anhydride is much more effective.\n\nThe substrate must be tolerant of the strongly acidic conditions of the Clemmensen reduction (37% HCl). Several alternatives are available. Acid-sensitive substrates that are stable to strong base can be reduced using the Wolff-Kishner reduction; a further, milder method for substrates stable to hydrogenolysis in the presence of Raney nickel is the two-step Mozingo reduction.\n\nIn spite of the antiquity of this reaction, the mechanism of the Clemmensen reduction remains obscure. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the reaction, mechanistic studies are difficult, and only a handful of studies have been disclosed. Mechanistic proposals generally invoke organozinc intermediates, sometimes including zinc carbenoids, either as discrete species or as organic fragments bound to the zinc metal surface. However, the corresponding alcohol is believed not to be an intermediate, since subjection of the alcohol to Clemmensen conditions generally does not afford the alkane product.\n\n\n"}

Some 11,000 people applied for the 150 jobs available when the publication first hired staff.\n\nThe origin of the name is unknown, although Ingersoll recalled that it probably referred to the fact that the paper appeared in the afternoon; \"The New Yorker\" reported that the name had been suggested by Lillian Hellman. (There is no historical evidence for the suggestion that the name was an abbreviation of \"Picture Magazine\".)\n\nThe first year of the paper was a general success, though it was already in some financial trouble: its circulation of 100,000–200,000 was insufficient. Circulation averaged 165,000, but the paper never managed to sell the 225,000 copies a day it needed to break even. Marshall Field III had become the paper's funder; quite unusually, he was a \"silent partner\" in this continually money-losing undertaking.\n\nAccording to a June 21, 1966, memo from Ingersoll:\n\"PM\" was sold in 1948 and published its final issue on June 22. The next day it was replaced by the \"New York Star\", which folded on January 28, 1949.\n\nThere were accusations that the paper was Communist-dominated, but others have concluded that the paper frequently opposed the policies of the Communist Party (CP) and engaged into editorial battles with the CP's paper, the \"Daily Worker\".\n\nTheodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, published more than 400 cartoons on \"PM\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s editorial page. Crockett Johnson's comic strip \"Barnaby\" debuted in the paper in 1942. Other artists who worked at PM included Ad Reinhardt, one of the founders of Abstract Expressionism, and Joseph LeBoit, who both contributed margin cartoons and drawings. Noted artist Jack Coggins contributed wartime artwork for at least 9 issues between 1940 and 1942.\n\nCoulton Waugh created his short-lived strip, \"Hank\", which began April 30, 1945 in \"PM\". The story of a disabled G.I. returning to civilian life, \"Hank\" had a unique look due to Waugh's decorative art style, combined with dialogue lettered in upper and lower case rather than the accepted convention of all uppercase lettering in balloons and captions. Some dialogue was displayed with white lettering reversed into black balloons. \"Hank\" sought to raise questions about the reasons for war, and how it might be prevented by the next generation. Waugh discontinued it at the very end of 1945 because of eyestrain. Cartoonist Jack Sparling created the short-lived comic strip \"Claire Voyant\", which ran from 1943 to 1948 in \"PM\", and which was subsequently syndicated by the \"Chicago Sun-Times\".\n\nJournalist I. F. Stone was the paper's Washington correspondent. He published an award-winning series on European Jewish refugees attempting to run the British blockade to reach Palestine, later collected and published as \"Underground to Palestine\". Staffers included theater critic Louis Kronenberger and film critic Cecelia Ager. Weegee, Margaret Bourke-White, Ray Platnick and Arthur Leipzig were the photographers.\n\nThe sports writers were Tom Meany, Tom O’Reilly and George F. T. Ryall, who covered horse racing. Sophie Smoliar was the New York City reporter working frequently with photographer Arthur Felig (Weegie) (submitted by her son and a collection of her original articles). Elizabeth Hawes wrote about fashion, and her sister Charlotte Adams covered food.\n\nOther writers who contributed articles included Erskine Caldwell, Myril Axlerod, McGeorge Bundy, Saul K. Padover, James Wechsler, eventually the paper's editorial writer, Penn Kimball, later a professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Myril Axelrod Bennett, Heywood Hale Broun, James Thurber, Dorothy Parker, Ernest Hemingway, Eugene Lyons, Earl Conrad, Benjamin Stolberg, Louis Adamic, Malcolm Cowley, Tip O'Neill (later Speaker of the House; and Ben Hecht.\n\nPicture News was the Sunday magazine section of \"PM.\" \n\n\n\n"}

He is the eldest son of former Major League Baseball pitcher Roger Clemens.\n\nBorn on December 4, 1986, in Houston, Texas, he was a two-sport star at Memorial High School, splitting time between football and baseball, before he suffered a back injury ending his brief football career.\n\nHe hit .413 as a junior, with 4 home runs and 23 RBIs in 2004. He had a .519 batting average and was named all-state in his senior year. As a pitcher, he had a 7–1 record and a 1.75 ERA.\n\nHe signed with the University of Texas at Austin (where his father played) to play first base on November 17, 2004, but never attended, choosing to go straight to professional baseball after he was drafted by the Houston Astros.\n\nThe Houston Astros picked Clemens in the 8th round of the amateur draft, 254th overall. The Astros organization had intended to use him as either a first or third baseman. He signed for a $380,000 bonus.\n\nIn 2005, he played his first minor league baseball season, hitting .297 with 4 homers and 17 RBIs in 33 games for the Rookie League Greeneville Astros, and .281 with 6 RBIs in 9 games with the Class A Tri-City ValleyCats. He committed 15 errors in 32 games at third base.\n\nIn 2006, he played with the Single-A Lexington Legends of the South Atlantic League, where he batted .229 with 5 home runs and 39 RBIs in 91 games. Clemens' sole appearance as a pitcher in professional baseball was for the Legends in 2006. On June 25, 2006, Clemens was in the news in a game against the Asheville Tourists. He was declared safe in a controversial play on second, leading the Tourists manager Joe Mikulik to go on a rampage. Through 2006, in the minors he batted .249 with 9 home runs, 63 RBIs, 7 stolen bases (while being caught once), and a .385 slugging percentage in 449 at bats. That season he hit a home run off his 43-year-old father, Roger Clemens, in a minor league exhibition game. In Koby's next at bat, Roger threw a brushback pitch at Koby in retaliation. They also played a game together in 2006,when the elder Clemens was making his comeback with the Astros and pitched a game for Lexington. \n\nIn the 2006 Hawaiian Winter League, playing for North Shore Honu, Clemens batted .196 with 1 home run and 9 RBIs in 32 games.\n\nIn 2007 he returned to the Single-A Lexington Legends, where he batted .252 with 15 home runs and 56 RBIs in 115 games.\n\nIn 2008 he played with the Single-A Salem Avalanche in the Carolina League, batting .268.\n\nHe converted to play as a catcher and played for the Corpus Christi Hooks in the Double-A Texas League. As of June 12, 2009, he returned to play with the Lancaster JetHawks in Advanced A in the California League in the roles of a catcher and designated hitter.\n\nIn 2010, he again played for Corpus Christi, then played with the Peoria Javelinas in the Arizona Fall League. \n\nIn 2011, Koby was with the Houston Astros' Triple-A affiliate, the Oklahoma City RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League, as their first baseman.\n\nClemens started playing at the Puerto Rico Baseball League with the Mayagüez Indians as a first baseman in the fall of 2011. However, he abandoned the team abruptly on November 10, 2011. There were rumors his father, former MLB pitcher Roger Clemens, persuaded him to leave the island because of the kidnapping of Washington Nationals catcher, Wilson Ramos in Venezuela the day before. For abandoning the team with no reason given, Koby was banned from playing baseball in the Caribbean Baseball Confederation.\n\nOn February 9, 2012, Clemens signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. During the 2012 season, he played for the Blue Jays' Double-A affiliate, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats of the Eastern League, and their high Single-A team, the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League as a catcher, first baseman, third baseman, outfielder, and designated hitter. He was released at the end of the season.\n\nKoby played in the California Winter League in Palm Springs, California from January 18 to February 16, 2013. From 2012-2014 he played for the Sugar Land Skeeters, including a game when he caught pitches thrown by his father.\n\nOn February 13, 2015, Clemens was hired as a minor league spring instructor for the Astros farm system. Astros Director of Player Development Quentin McCracken said the Astros \"expect by the end of the year or by next season he will be on staff fully.\" He now owns his own baseball company called Koby Clemens Baseball Clinics and teaches individual and private lessons.\n"}

They were farmers looking for places to settle down, engaging in agriculture to survive. Its origin is evident in the fact that Balungao is one of the Ilocano-speaking towns in the province where the primary language is the Pangasinense.\n\nBalungao was originally called \"Panaclaban\" and was a part of Cuyapo town in the adjacent province of Nueva Ecija till the latter part of 18th century. It was annexed to the town of Rosales, Pangasinan in the early part of 19th century because of its geographic location. It officially became an independent municipality in 1815.\n\nMount Balungao () is an extinct volcano, ASL located in the municipality of Balungao. Its volcanic past is manifested by its physical profile and the presence of hot and cold springs.

The municipality maintains close relations with San Carlos City and Malasiqui, with whom it would partition the impoverished municipality of Basista if the said town would choose partition instead of reunification with San Carlos City.\n\nThe name of this town according to the legend, came from the name of a plant called \"balangbang\" (Bauhinia acuminata) which grew in abundance during the early days. \"Culibangbang\" leaves were used for bulalong Iloko or sinigang. The verdant hills of Bayambang were almost covered by these plants. The people made pickles out of them. As years passed by, these plants became extinct in the vicinity, but the name \"Bayambang\" which sounds like an echo of the plant's name, was retained and was given to designate this town.\n\nOthers believed that the name of the town came from the once numerous \"Culibangbang\" trees, misunderstood as \"Bayambang\" by the Spaniards when they first came to this town.\n\nTelbang (Bagbag in Ilokano, Dapdap in other dialects, scientific name: Erythrina variegata Linn. var. orientalis, Linn.) was the original Bayambang according tales. Bayambang is not a tree name, but a plant name: Celosia - Deeringia polysperma (Roxb.) Moq. (as C. polysperma Roxb.).\n\nBayambang is bounded on the north by Malasiqui, on the south by Camiling, on the east by Bautista, and on the west by Urbiztondo. Bayambang is the southern-most town of the province of Pangasinan. It is the gateway to Tarlac Province in the south.\n\nThe town's topography or terrain varies from rolling lands and hills to generally flat plains. Its climate is marked by the wet season from June to October, and dry season from November to May.\n\nLand area: 16,800 hectares\n\nBayambang is politically subdivided into 77 barangays, 11 of which are urban barangays and 66 are rural barangays.\n\nThe “Awarans” account that Benaldo Gutierrez and Honorato Carungay, Bayambang was founded in the early 16th century by an Aeta, Agalet. Bayambang was inside Inirangan and Hermosa, then re-located to Telbang and southern Poblacion, the Old Bayambang.\n\nIn 1897, the first \"Juez de Cuchillo\" executed residents and burned houses. On November 1899, Emilio Aguinaldo designated Bayambang as Pangasinan capital (also during the Japanese Regime), the seat of our short-lived Philippine Republic, due to capture by Gen. Arthur MacArthur of Tarlac on October 12, 1899. Jose P. Rizal visited Camiling, Tarlac's Leonor Rivera, since it was formerly a part of Bayambang. Antonio Luna built a camp in Bayambang. Dr. Diaz became Governor under the Japanese Imperial Government and held Office in Bayambang, at the Eulogio Dauz residence (junction of Quezon Blvd. And M.H. Del Pilar streets).\n\nBayambang was the seat of the UNESCO National Community Training Center.\nVicente Cayabyab, Gobernadorcillo was the first Chief Executive of the town during the Spanish Regime followed by Mauricio de Guzman, first Cabeza de Barangay (Municipal Captain). Honorato Carungay, Lorenzo Rodriguez and Julian Mananzan succeeded him, and later, Saturnino, Evaristo Dimalanta as president.\n\nLauriano Roldan became the first Civil Government President, and succeeded by Alvino Garcia, Mateo Mananzan, Gavino de Guzman, Marciano Fajardo, Agustin Carungay, Emeterio Camacho, and Enrique M.

The station is owned by the Meredith Local Media subsidiary of Des Moines, Iowa-based Meredith Corporation. WNEM-TV's studios are located on North Franklin Street in downtown Saginaw, with a second newsroom in downtown Flint. The station's transmitter is located on Becker Road in Robin Glen-Indiantown, in Buena Vista Township, east of Saginaw. On cable, WNEM-TV is available on channel 5 on most systems, except on Charter Spectrum, where it is carried on channel 7.\n\nOn the week before May 5, 1952, Goodwill Stations, owner of WJR radio in Detroit, announced the intent of applying for four station licenses which would operate as a regional network—UHF channel 50 in Detroit, channel 11 in Toledo, Ohio, channel 12 in Flint and channel 5 in Bay City. WNEM-TV was founded by the NorthEastern Michigan Corporation, hence the call letters, on February 16, 1954, as an NBC affiliate. Originally, its main studios were located on rented space at Bishop International Airport in Flint with auxiliary studios in its city of license, Bay City. In the 1960s, it moved its main studios to the transmitter site in Indiantown, after flirting with the idea of co-locating the television station on the WSAM tower in Saginaw. During its first four years, WNEM-TV had a secondary affiliation with ABC sharing programming from that network with WKNX-TV (channel 57, now WEYI-TV channel 25) until 1958 when WJRT-TV signed-on and took that affiliation. WNEM-TV also aired programming from DuMont until that network dissolved in August 1956.\n\nProfessional violinist James Gerity's Gerity Broadcasting bought the station in 1961 and sold it to the Meredith Corporation in 1969. In the mid-1980s, the station moved its primary studios to their current location in downtown Saginaw. The Becker Road studios would later be used for the Buena Vista campus of Delta College, though the complex still houses WNEM-TV's transmitter. By the late 1980s, mirroring a trend in many other television markets, WNEM-TV was the dominant station in Mid-Michigan, helped by NBC's then-dominant prime-time lineup.\n\nOn January 16, 1995, WNEM-TV and WEYI swapped networks, and WNEM-TV became a CBS affiliate (announced June 30, 1994). The move came as part of the larger U.S. television network affiliation switches of 1994 that saw CBS' longtime affiliate in Detroit, WJBK-TV, switch to the Fox network, and CBS was unable to get WXYZ-TV (whose ABC affiliation was renewed), WXON-TV, WKBD, WDIV, or WADL to switch networks; CBS eventually purchased independent station WGPR-TV and transformed it into WWJ-TV in December 1994.\n\nThe day that WNEM-TV became a CBS affiliate, it also took on secondary affiliations with both UPN and The WB and aired programming from the two networks late at night. The station relinquished the secondary WB affiliation in October 1999 to WEYI. It dropped CBS' daytime soap opera \"Guiding Light\" in 1996 due to low ratings, which made it one of two CBS stations in the nation that did not carry the program for what would turn out to be its final 13 years (the other was KOVR in Sacramento, California). However, by 2007 the show was aired instead on My5 at 10 a.m., and stayed there for the rest of its run. WNEM now clears the entire CBS daytime lineup on their primary channel, having moved \"Guiding Light\"s replacement \"Let's Make a Deal\" over from My5 in 2012. It currently airs at 10 a.m.\n\nIn 2006, WNEM-TV entered into a news share agreement with WSMH. On September 10, 2007, the station dropped its 9 a.m. show, \"Tyra Banks\", for \"Better Mid Michigan\".\nBy May 2008, WNEM used its MyNetworkTV affiliation to launch \"My 5\" cable channel along with some Detroit Pistons games. My 5 was launched later on an over the air subchannel.\n\nWNEM-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 22, using PSIP to display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 5. However, channel 5 analog did remain on-the-air for a short period afterward with a nightlight slide with phone numbers and information about the switch.\n\nAs of April 1, 2011, Comcast cable subscribers in Holly, Michigan and surrounding areas recently had WNEM-TV replaced with Detroit's WWJ-TV as the main CBS network affiliate. My5 was also replaced with WMYD as the main MyNetworkTV affiliate. While Holly is much closer to Flint than Detroit ( compared to ), it is in the far northern portion of Oakland County, which is technically part of the .\n\nOn November 21, 2011, WNEM-TV aired allegations of sexual abuse against U.S. Representative Dale Kildee that were criticized as politically motivated and a breach of journalistic ethics. An attorney for the station said that the broadcast was protected as it involved a public official and that no actual malice was intended.\n\nWSMH dropped WNEM's 10 p.m. news from their primary subchannel on April 27, 2015, while WNEM moved that program to its My5 subchannel. Also in the spring of 2015, WNEM added another subchannel with an affiliation with Cozi TV. WNEM added a fourth subchannel and affiliated it with Ion in April 2017. While continuing its MyNetworkTV affiliation, My5 subchannel was renamed to WNEM-TV5 PLUS on July 30, 2018.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nLittle to no records are held regarding the station's early programming. The few that were remembered are \"Chester the Clown\", \"Hoss 'n' Stuff\", \"Mr. Hot Dog\", \"Captain Muddy\" hosting \"Popeye\" cartoons, \"Adventure Patrol\" and the \"Jumping Cowboy.\"\n\nAt launch, the station hired Chet Rogoza as an announcer and drafted as the \"Chester the Clown\" host. Chester only being a puppet controlled by Rogoza. Harold Stone joined the show as the puppet master for Mr. Shaakestail, Bard disciple dog late in the shows run, which ended in the early 1960s.\n\n\"Hoss 'n' Stuff\" featured a puppet horse played by Jim Adams and the mailman Stuff played by Chuck Waters. Stuff would visit Hoss at the fence for a comedic interchange with Stuff being the straight man.\n\n\"Mr. Hot Dog\" originated as an ad featuring Jim Peyton as the logo character of the restaurant chain of the same name. Quickly, the character had its own Saturday morning program with the added puppet character of Daddy Cool with a long wiener-shaped nose.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1968, Chuck Waters as \"Captain Muddy\" of the S.S. Mudhole hosted the \"Popeye\" cartoons. \"Adventure Patrol\" was hosted by station manager Tom Mathews with little else known about the show. A transfer from the Cadillac-Traverse City market, the station had a Western show featuring Kenny Roberts, the \"Jumping Cowboy.\"\n\nWNEM-TV televises regional and national sports from CBS Sports. Local sports include games of the Michigan Wolverines and Michigan State Spartans men's basketball teams (via the \"College Basketball on CBS\" contract), and Detroit Lions home games against AFC opponents (via the \"NFL on CBS\" contract). The station is also an affiliate of the Detroit Lions Television Network which airs preseason games. Since WNEM-TV's normal coverage area reaches within of the Lions' home Ford Field, it is part of the Lions' blackout area; this applies to both preseason and regular season games. Channel 5 has also televised three home games of the local Ontario Hockey League team the Saginaw Spirit. By 2007, WNEM picked up Detroit Pistons games outside of the network agreements for My5 TV. In February 2007, WNEM picked up 17 Detroit Tigers games through Fox Sports Detroit's Tigers regional TV network primarily for My5 TV.\n\nIn addition to its main facilities, the station operates a Genesee County Bureau at the Wade Trim Building on Saginaw Street in Downtown Flint. This had been located in Mundy Township's Gateway Center until October 2008. WNEM-TV operates their own weather radar, known as \"First Warn 5 Pinpoint Doppler Radar\", on the eastern side of MBS International Airport which is also streamed live on its website.\n\nWNEM broadcasts news at 4:30, 5, 6 and 9 a.m., noon, 5, 5:30, 6 and 11 p.m. On weekends, they broadcast a morning show at 8 a.m. Saturday and a two-hour show at 7 a.m. on Sunday. Weekend evenings includes local news in the 6 p.m. hour and an 11 p.m. broadcast. While on WNEM-TV 5 Plus, its news department has an hour-long news at 10 p.m. every day of the week plus a 7 p.m. half-hour on weeknights.\n\nWNEM-TV produced news segments for then-sister radio station WNEM 1250 AM; this ended after that station adopted a Catholic-based format under new owners. WSGW 790 AM in Saginaw now rebroadcasts the 6 p.m. news. WNEM-TV 5 Plus previously rebroadcast the main channel's weeknight 6 o'clock newscast at 7, but this has since been replaced by a live newscast at 7.\n\nIn 2006, WNEM-TV entered into a news share agreement with Fox affiliate WSMH for their existing nightly prime time broadcast at 10 on that station. This came about after that station's owner, the Sinclair Broadcast Group, shut down its \"News Central\" operation as well as WSMH's news department. Originally entitled \"TV 5 News at 10 on Fox 66\", the WNEM-TV-produced program recently added new graphics and was renamed \"Fox 66 News at 10\". On Monday nights during the newscast, the \"Fugitive Files\" segment aired. On April 27, 2015, WSMH dropped WNEM's hour-long 10 p.m. news from their primary channel in favor of a new 10 p.m. show produced by the now Sinclair-managed WEYI, while WNEM moved that program to its WNEM-TV 5 Plus subchannel.\n\nIn August 2009, the station began carrying obituaries following its weekday morning, Noon and 6 o'clock shows. This service began after local major newspapers in the region including \"The Bay City Times\", \"The Saginaw News\", and \"The Flint Journal\" reduced publication to three times a week in June 2009. At first, a free service when it was launched, WNEM-TV began charging $100 per obituary in September 2009. As of October 19, 2009, over 700 obituaries appeared on the channel and its website, obitmichigan.com. WNEM-TV became the second television in both Michigan and the United States, after WJBK, to air obituaries on a daily basis.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nOne of Binalonan's natives is the Filipino-American writer Carlos Bulosan, who wrote brief descriptions of the town's history and people in his semi-autobiographical novel entitled \"America is in the Heart\". The town has a memorial and street named after him just north of the municipal hall and town market. It is also the hometown of Evangelina de la Cruz Macaraeg Macapagal, spouse of 9th President Diosdado Macapagal, and mother of 14th President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\n\nBinalonan is located in the eastern part of the province of Pangasinan. The municipality is bordered on the north by the municipalities of Pozorrubio and Sison, on the south by Urdaneta, on the east by San Manuel and Asingan and on the west by Laoac.\n\nIt is from Lingayen and from Manila.\n\nThe municipality's total land area, estimated at , is classified as alienable and disposable land.\n\nThere are 5 types of soil which can be found in Binalonan: the San Manuel fine sandy loam, San Manuel loam, San Manuel sandy loam, San Manuel clay, and Umingan sandy loam.\n\nBinalonan has 2 major rivers: the Aloragat River and Tagamusing River. It also has minor rivers, including the San Pablo Creek, Tuboy River, Palma Creek, the Camambogan Creek and Balisa Creek.\n\nBinalonan is subdivided into 24 barangays.\n\nAccording to historians, the town's name is an evolution of the Pangasinan Language term \"balon\", which means \"packed lunch\", or in Tagalog, \"baon\".\n\nIn a traditional story, which now plays an important role in the town's history, the area was originally owned by a Spaniard named Don Salvador. It was told that he instructed his men to put up crude wooden fences along the property to establish his ownership. During the course of their work, Don Salvador's men used to have their lunch and rest under Camachile trees located in the center of the land mainly due to its breezy shades.\n\nDon Salvador offered his pastureland to several immigrants from Ilocos. When they asked Don Salcador how they were going to find the said land, the owner answered: \"It is the place where people bring their \"balon\" to eat\". Hence the term Binnalonan, which in Ilocano and Pangasinan means \"a place where people bring and eat their \"baon\"\", was born. At present, the town is called Binalonan while its people are known as Binalonians.\n\nIlocano herdsmen and laborers composed the first town which was founded in 1838, in San Felipe, which was later transferred to Santa Catalina, then returned to the present site.\n\nThe urban population is recorded at 7,634 while the rural population is at 45,088. The urban-rural population ratio is estimated at 15/100. The male-to-female ratio is 1.029.\n\nBinalonan's Chief Executive is Mayor Ramon N. Guico, Jr.\n\nThe topmost structure depicted on the municipal seal is an image of the municipality's Municipal Hall. Below it on the left is a depiction of the antenna of Digital Communications, the center of communications for Regions I, II and CAR.\n\nBeside the antenna is a representation of a subsidiary source of income in Binalonan: the raising of chickens and hogs. At the bottom, the left image is that of rice stalks, the municipality's main product. Beside it is the picture of a sugar cane, which is the main ingredient for Binalonan's top products — \"basi\", \"suka\" and \"muskuvado\" (brown sugar). The shield encasing these images means that Binalonan is under the province of Pangasinan.\n\nBinalonan Rock Garden defines the town with century-old acacia trees guarding the walking pavements, benches, Balikbayan Hall, basketball court and the pathway towards the historic Santo Nino Parish Church.\n\nThe town's interesting points include:\n\nThe 1841 (19th century architecture) Santo Niño Parish Church, in under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan, Roman Catholic Diocese of Urdaneta. Its Feast Day is 3rd Sunday of January, with Parish Priest, Father Elisar Christopher M. Itchon and Parochial Vicar, Father Jun G. Laya and Vicar Forane, Father Elpidio F. Silva Jr.\n\nFr. Julian Izaga founded San Felipe, the origin of the Church and town freed from Manaoag since 1834, and moved to Santa Catalina, where he built church and a convent of light materials. Fr. Ramon Fernandez transferred the town in 1938 to the present site..\n\nThe Dominicans founded Binalonan Parish in 1841, under Kura Paroko, Fr. Domingo Llue and then, by Fr. Policarpio Illana who began construction of the Church in 1842.\n\nFr. Antonio Vinelas erected in 1855 a bigger church, with Fr. Ruperto Alarcon's construction in 1861. Fr. Juan Fernandez (1861-1865) built a provisional church. In 1866–1873, Fr. Felix Cantador added old convent walls, while Fr. P.del Campo finished the Church. In 1879,\n\nThe October 19, 1881 typhoon destroyed the 1879 Church. Father Silvestre Fernandez added the 3 naves rehabilitation due to the earthquake of 1882. The Church was placed under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of El Santisimo Nombre de Jesus. In the Hispano-American War the church was destroyed.\n\nAfter the 1898 Revolution, Fr. Mariano Pacis became the Pastor of Manaoag and Binalonan, but it was Fr. Pio Mabutas who finished the Church in 1930. The Japanese destroyed the Church except the miraculous image of Santo Nino.\n\nFr. Pablo Evangelista rehabilitated the Church in 1946 and Fr. Leon Bitanga reconstructed in until 1961, founding the Holy Child Academy.\n\nIt was only on January 30, 2008 that the Church's marker was imposed upon generous donations of New York and New Jersey Binalonans (Joey and Remy Castelo-Sellona and Drs.

{"id": "2069075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069075", "title": "Rehearsal letter", "text": "Rehearsal letter\n\nA rehearsal letter is a boldface letter of the alphabet in an orchestral score, and its corresponding parts, that provides the conductor, who typically leads rehearsals, with a convenient spot to tell the orchestra to begin at places other than the start of movements or pieces. Rehearsal letters are most often used in scores of the Romantic era and onwards, beginning with Louis Spohr. Rehearsal letters are typically placed at structural points in the piece.\n\nThey may also be generically called rehearsal marks or rehearsal figures, or, when numbers are used instead of letters, rehearsal numbers.\n\nIn the course of rehearsing a symphony or piece, it is often necessary for the conductor to stop and go back to some point in the middle, in order to master the more difficult passages or sections, or to resolve a challenge that the ensemble is having. Many scores and parts have bar numbers, every five or ten bars, or at the beginning of each page or line. But as pieces and individual movements of works became longer (extending to several hundred bars) as the Romantic era progressed, bar numbers became less practical in rehearsal.\n\nFor example, a conductor can tell their musicians to resume at bar 387, so that the musicians have to find the nearest bar number in their parts (e.g. 385 or 390) and count back or forward a couple of measures. Even if the number 387 is written at the appropriate bar, it might not particularly stand out. But if there is, for example, a big, bold letter M in the score and parts, it is much easier for the conductor to just say \"begin at letter M\". Even if the conductor were to say \"one bar before letter M\", that would still be more convenient than saying \"bar 386\". Alternatively the conductor could first say \"before M...\" and allow the players time to find M and then say \"one bar\".\n\nIn the score of a full orchestra, rehearsal letters are typically placed over the flutes' (or piccolo's) staff, and duplicated above the first violins' staff. For concert bands, rehearsal letters are placed over the piccolo's staff (or flutes'), and over the trumpets'. Rehearsal letters should appear in every part, but the conductor or librarian should check this and also make sure that they agree with the conductor's score; if they do not, the letters from the parts should be copied to the conductor's score. For typical pieces or movements of the Romantic era marked allegro, the letters A to Z can be used up, though the letters I, J or O (or all) may be skipped.\n\nPlacement and frequency of the letters do not follow a hard-and-fast rule. Generally they are inserted at places where there is a musically significant change, for example a new theme, or a change in dynamic or instrumentation or the start of a new section – just those places where a conductor might want to restart in rehearsal. In addition, having the letters coincide with musical signposts can help players who are counting rests confirm they are still in the right place, which would not be possible if the marks were placed at numerically regular intervals.\n\nThe letter A is almost always used for a point close to the beginning, but not for the very beginning itself because it is much easier to say \"from the beginning\". Likewise, rehearsal letters are not necessary at changes in tempo, key signature or time signature, as the name of the new tempo or signature can serve the same purpose. For example, in some editions of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, letter A of the Finale does not occur until bar 140, when the relatively late entry of the first violins with the \"Ode to Joy\" theme might not stand out enough to the other players to be a convenient point of reference, whereas the reminiscences of the previous movements' themes are more easily referenced by their tempo markings.\n\nA rehearsal letter usually breaks a multimeasure rest in a part (except in cases where a given instrument does not play at all in a given movement of the work). Because rehearsal letters are sometimes independent of edition and in some cases even version, they are also useful for telling applicants for positions in the orchestra what passages they need to play at the audition. They are also useful for easy reference in scholarly essays about orchestral works. However, rehearsal letters are altogether absent from some editions of some pieces that have them in other editions, such as the older editions of Richard Wagner's \"Meistersinger\" prelude.\n\nRehearsal letters are less useful in unaccompanied instrumental music such as the solo piano repertoire (although they may be used in duets), since the instrumentalist has no need to communicate to a fellow player where to resume playing. Songs also tend not to use them, because it is more useful to refer to the lyrics (except in pieces where the lyrics are highly repetitive, or those with long lyric-less sections).\n\nIn some cases, A to Z might not be enough. After Z, Aa may be used, followed by Bb, and so on until Zz (though Ii, Jj and/or Oo might also be skipped). The Wilhelm Hansen edition of Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 7 in C major presents one unusual case: the letters A to Z (including both I and J, as well as O) are used up with just three more pages left in the score. For the final flute and bassoon solo, the editors use Ö (the final letter of the Finnish alphabet) as a rehearsal letter.But in the case of some composers, such as Gustav Mahler and Dmitri Shostakovich, twice through the alphabet might still not be enough. For this reason, some editors prefer rehearsal numbers to rehearsal letters. Mahler's and Shostakovich's scores use rehearsal numbers rather than letters. These are typically in boldface and enclosed in a box, or less commonly, a circle. Confusingly, however, some editions enclose bar numbers in boxes, though usually not in bold. In the Schirmer edition of Roy Harris's Symphony No. 3 (in one movement), the rehearsal numbers are enclosed in circles, and they occur every ten measures, actually being the bar number divided by 10. That rehearsal numbers \"are easily confused with measure numbers\" is a reason sometimes given in favor of rehearsal letters.\n\nAdvocates of rehearsal numbers counter that even 26 letters are not enough for some scores. Whereas rehearsal letters reset to A for each movement of a multi-movement work (even for connected movements), rehearsal numbers typically run over the course of the entire work, even if the movements are not connected. For example, the rehearsal number for the last few bars of the first movement of Edward Elgar's First Symphony is 55; the first rehearsal number of the second movement is 56. There are exceptions, however. The final outburst in the first movement of Mahler's Second Symphony is rehearsal number 27. Mahler actually wanted a pause of five minutes before the next movement, so the rehearsal numbers reset to 1, ending with 15. The third movement follows after a short break, but its first rehearsal number is 28.\nFor jazz and pop compositions with several choruses, \"many jazz composers and arrangers\" use a format in which \"each successive verse/chorus part of the form is assigned successive letters of the alphabet\" combined with a measure number: for example, letter A for the first 8-bar phrase of the verse after the introduction, A9 for the next 8-bar phrase, A17, A25, then B, B9, B17, B25 for the chorus, etc., with the special rehearsal marking TAG for the tag ending. In jazz and pop music, the musicians frequently refer to the \"A section\" or the \"B section\" of a 32 bar song during rehearsals. In pop music, the music is commonly organized into standard sections, such as an intro, multiple verses and choruses (refrain), one or more bridges, a guitar solo (or other instrumental solos), and an outros. As such, a bandleader who wishes to start in the middle of a song will typically specify which part of this structure the band should start on (e.g., \"last four bars of the bridge, going into the guitar solo\" or \"last verse and go to the outro\").\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nSea urchins are regularly harvested at Isla Silaki, Bolinao. The town, aside from being a fishing domain, is also a heritage site in the Philippines, possessing an olden church surrounded by heritage houses. The town is also the location of the cave where the gold-teeth Bolinao Skulls with fish scale designs were found. Scholars have been pushing for the town's cultural landscape into the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nBolinao is politically subdivided into 30 barangays.\n\nFolk etymology attributes the name \"Bolinao\" or this remote fishing enclave from the fish piece \"monamon\" but commonly called \"Bolinao\" by the Tagalogs, Bicolanos and the Visayans. A theory also points out that once upon a time \"pamulinawen\" trees grew luxuriantly along its shores, thus, the Ilocano migrants who crossed the Lingayen Gulf named it phonetically similar to the name of the tree. Nowadays, however, such tree does not exist anymore.\n\nUnofficial records narrate the story of an Italian missionary named Blessed Odoric of Pordenone who said the first mass in Bolinao Bay, baptizing several locals while he was on his way to China. He took refuge in what is now known as Bolinao during a storm in 1324. Two centuries later, an account narrates the arrival of Juan de Salcedo and his crew reached Bolinao and chanced upon a Chinese Sampan who captured a native chieftain. Salcedo and his men liberated the natives and the latter immediately pledged vassalage to the King of Spain.\n\nAccording to oral history, the town of Bolinao used to be a small settlement in what is now Barrio Binabalian in Santiago Island, then having a population of just over a hundred families. It is said that Captain Pedro Lombi founded the town of Bolinao in 1575. A decade later, Dominican Friar Esteban Marin became the first Spanish missionary to evangelize the people of Bolinao. For two years he worked in Bolinao before he was assigned as prior in Batac, Ilocos Norte.\n\nThe Dominicans ended their service in 1607 to be replaced by the Augustinian Recollects headed by Fr. Jeronimo de Cristo and Dr. Andres del Espiritu Santo. At this time, the old town of Bolinao was still located along the coast of Pangasinan. Due to pirate attacks, the town was transferred to the mainland in 1609.\n\nThis town formerly included the neighboring town of Anda, but Anda became an independent municipality on May 26, 1849.\n\nBolinao is also the home town of Emerita Romero, who now resides in Canada.\n\nOn November 18, 2007, Bolinao challenged the belief that the first Mass in the Philippines was held on March 31, 1521, Easter Sunday, at Limasawa in Southern Leyte. Memorial markers (donated by Italian priest Luigi Malamocco, 62, from Odorico's hometown of Friuli, Italy) were set in the town's church and on Santiago Island, claiming that in 1324, Franciscan missionaries led by an Italian priest named Odorico celebrated a thanksgiving Mass thereat and also baptized natives.\n\nBolinao Mayor Alfonso Celeste said the local government will file damage suit against Indonesian owners of the barge APOL 3003. The University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute (UPMSI) stated that the environmental damage was P 54.9 million ($1 =- P 40). The barge towed by a tug boat from Indonesia to the power plant in Sual, Pangasinan on November 27 when Typhoon \"Mina\" winds destroyed its anchor and rope, then hurled to Ilog Malino reef, spilling 95% of its coal cargo. The hard coal spill spread to 330,000 square metres of coral and sea grass areas.\n\nThe Bolinao Skull is a skull dated between the 14th and 15th centuries A.D. recovered in the Balingasay archeological site in Bolinao. The Bolinao Skull is the most well known artifact from the site, noted for the intricate gold ornamentation formed in the shape of scales on the surfaces of its teeth. However, 67 other skulls containing teeth with less extensive gold ornamentation were also found at the Balingasay site. The skull is now displayed within the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.\n\nThe Japanese Imperial forces were landed and occupied the town municipality of Bolinao on December 1941 and established of the military garrison of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces. The joint military force of the United States, Australian and Philippine Commonwealth troops including the local resistance fighters liberated the town municipality of Bolinao on January 1945 due to retake in Luzon and aftermath in World War II.\n\nThe word Bolinao is a term used for the name of the town, the people, and the language.\n\nThe Bolinao people generally speak Pangasinan, Ilocano, Tagalog, and their own unique native language called Bolinao, which is also used in a nearby town, Anda --- former barangay of the Bolinao town. The Bolinao language is closely related to Sambalic. Bolinao was part of the province of Zambales from mid-18th and was turned over to Pangasinan in 1903. Most people generally understand and speak English because of the annual visit of local and foreign tourists in the different bodies of water in the town including beaches, falls, caves, river, and other protected sanctuaries which are prohibited areas for tourists.\n\nThe Mother Tongue Policy of the DepEd is enforced in the elementary schools of these barangays to empower the native languages in town.\n\nThe Cape Bolinao Lighthouse at Patar rises above sea level atop Punta Piedra Point, a towering hill of solid rock which is the sharp point of Cape Bolinao itself. It was built by the Americans in 1903 on a high promontory at the western part of Cape Bolinao, the lighthouse still sends signals to vessels passing by the area.\n\nThe lighthouse provides a panoramic view of a portion of the 1,269 hectares Cape Bolinao Dendro Thermal Ipil-Ipil Plantation on a land area where archaeological excavations have revealed relics from the 14th to the 15th centuries. Filipino, British and American engineers constructed the lighthouse in 1905.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Geodetic Surveys, the land elevation is . Visibility is at midsea towards the lighthouse in Poro Point. The winding stairway has 6 platforms with 20 steps or rungs for a total of 120 steps plus 14 more to the illumination room, or an overall total of 134 steps.\n\nTertiary schools:\n\nSecondary schools:\n\nElementary schools:\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality of Bugallon was formerly called \"Salasa\" (meaning floor joist in the dialect, a part of a wooden house where the floor is attached to). In the Spanish colonial era, the Spanish authorities established the town center in Poblacion (now Barangay Salasa). Because of the 1914 massive flooding and erosion, the town center was later transferred to Barrio Anagao (became Barangay Poblacion) but the Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, one of the oldest churches in the country, could not be transferred (every time someone attempts, he dies). A new Catholic church was created in the Poblacion, the Saint Andrew Catholic Church. This is the reason why Bugallon has two Catholic Churches (one in Salasa and the other in Anagao).\n\nFr. Antonio Perez. founded Salasa (1714-1747) In 1720, Poblacion was in Barangay Polong's Don Francisco Valencerina yard, later transferred later to Baranggay Salasa on January 24, 1734 by Fr. Fernando Garcia. The Plaza, Presedencia, the church and convent, were engineered by the Frayle (surrounded by parallel calles). Doña Milagros Klar, wife of then manager of Pantranco (Philtranco) donated in 1935, the Our Lady of Lourdes statue to Salasa Shrine.\n\nThe town was named after the town's hero Major Jose Torres Bugallon who fought together with Gen. Antonio Luna during the Philippine–American War in 1899. February 5, 1899, at the Battle of La Loma, Bugallon faced Gen. Arthur MacArthur. Bugallon suffered a shot to the thigh during the battle. Later that day, in the arms of Antonio Luna, Bugallon died from excessive loss of blood.\n\nIn 1921, the town of Salasa was renamed to Bugallon. Mr. Canullas founded the Jose Torres Bugallonas association and a monument was erected in the plaza, wherein the bones of General Bugallon were interred thereat on January 12, 1958.\n\nThe act of changing Salasa an old town to a new one, Bugallon, required a congressional approval sponsored by the Congressman Mauro Navarro, first district of Pangasinan, and obtained congressional approval in changing Salasa to Bugallon. Hence, Salasa became a mere barangay but remains the seat of Our Lady of Lourdes Parish (11 barangays) and the other is Bugallon's St. Andrew the Apostle (14 barangay).\n\nBugallon is politically subdivided into 24 barangays.\n\nBugallon's Chief Executives are Mayor Priscilla “Mely” Ignacio Espino (wife of former governor Amado Espino) and Vice Mayor Winston P. Tandoc and elected officials include 8 Sangguniang Bayan Councilors or Members \n• Rogelio Benjie Madriguera\n• Aislinn De Guzman\n• Ernesto Tanigue\n• Marlon Cuison\n• Gemma Canullas\n• Ramie Ocsan\n• Bernardo De Vera\n• Rolando Manaoat\nholding office at the Town hall's Legislative Building, where the Sesson Hall is located.\n\nBugallon's interesting points, destinations and products, events, include:\n\n\nThe 1920 St. Andrew the Apostle Parish Church (Poblacion, Bugallon, 2416 Pangasinan) is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan, Roman Catholic Diocese of Alaminos. The church has impressive inspired-baroque type of altar for the saints.\n\nIts Feast Day is November 30 with Parish Priest, Fr. Dominador Mendoza, Jr., Population of 57,445. It is part of the Vicariate of Our Lady of Lourdes, under Vicar Forane, Father Raymond R. Oligane\n\nSt. Andrew the Apostle Parish was originally erected at Salasa (founded by the Dominicans in the 18th century). When the town site was transferred, the seat of the parish was also transferred as a consequence brought about by natural calamities that battered the area.\n\nThe 1914 Salasa floods destroyed crops, properties, buildings, the church and convent. Poblacion was transferred to Barangay Anagao (Bugallon), under Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Andrew the Apostle remained the patron Saint in July 1920 with 1st Parish Priest, Fr. Eustaquio Ocampo, then, Fr. Montano Domingo on November 29, 1921 and on June 1928, Fr Emeterio Domagas succeeded.\n\nOn May 23, 1929, Pangasinan was created as a new Diocese and Msgr. Cesar Maria Guerrero became Pangasinan's First Bishop onn May 23, 1929. In 1930, Franciscan Capuchin appointed Fr. Cesario of Legario and Fr. Fernando of Erasum to Bugallon and Salasa, respectively on September 17, 1930. The Salasa Church, one of the biggest in Philippines, 100 meters long was completely destroyed and despoiled by Bugallon natives. Fr. Benjamin of Ilarduya became Kura Paroko from October 16, 1933 to June 27, 1941. The church brick-structure and the old façade were built. During World War II, Fr. Hipolito of Azcoita parish priest of Labrador, was transferred to Bugallon. Father Fidel Lekamania added the convent, while Father Pedro V.

{"id": "2069081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069081", "title": "Burgos, Pangasinan", "text": "Burgos, Pangasinan\n\n', officially the ', (; ; ), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nOn the western part of Pangasinan, along the coast of the China Sea lies a town called - Burgos, perched on a broad plateau.\n\nBurgos was founded as an independent town in 1830 by the early Ilocanos from Paoay, Ilocos Norte headed by Don Matías Guiang. The provincial government of Zambales has not ignored the ever increasing population and as it saw the necessity of a government to oversee the village. Don Matías Guiang made history, as quoted from the Philippine Archives, when on May 15, 1830 the Spanish Governor of Zambales issued a decree creating the settlement into a \"pueblo\" and appointed Don Matías Guiang as the first \"gobernadorcillo\".\n\nThe town of Burgos was ceded to the Province of Pangasinan, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903, of the Philippine Commission.\n\nBurgos was originally named San Isidro in honor of its patron saint. Since there was another locality named San Isidro along the Lingayen Gulf, the residents added \"\"Potot\" \" to the town's name. This term is an Ilocano adjective meaning \"clipped\", \"cut-off\" or \"disconnected\", referring to the Amburayan River which during dry season doesn't have continuous water. This stream, therefore, is discontinued and disconnected during summer months. Confusion however continued and persisted as mail for San Isidro \"de Potot\" was erroneously sent to the town of San Isidro Labrador and those of the latter to the former town.\n\nTo resolve the confusion, Mayor Don Anacleto Ruiz changed the town's name to Burgos in 1913, in memory of Filipino martyr Padre José Apolonio Burgos, who together with Padre Gomez and Zamora were executed in the field of Bagumbayan on February 17, 1872.\n\nBurgos is in the western part of Pangasinan on a broad plateau at the edge of the Zambales mountain ranges. It is west of Mabini, south of Agno, north of Dasol, and east of the South China Sea; about from the capital town of Lingayen. It also holds the westernmost point in Luzon.\n\nBurgos is politically subdivided into 14 barangays.\n\nIn the first part of the 19th century, Matías Guiang, a mighty sailor-explorer from the town of Paoay, Ilocos Norte, regularly traveled the China Sea between the Ilocos and Zambales regions. Attracted to its agricultural possibilities, Guiang along with his family, friends and neighbors eventually migrated to Zambales \"del Norte\", now the westernmost part of the province of Pangasinan. They disembarked at the mouth of the Agno River by tracing it.\n\nThey found a settlement in the eastern part of the present town proper. Once the settlement had grown sufficiently large enough, it was organized into a \"pueblo\", with Don Matías Guiang, who was then the most wealthy and influential land owner of the place, as the first \"gobernadorcillo\". San Isidro \"de Potot\" was its incorporated name in honor of Saint Isidore the Laborer, whom the settlers had adopted as their patron saint.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the \"gobernadorcillo\" was Don Tomás Braga, and the parish priest of the town before the revolution was Mariano Torrente, a native of Barcelona, Spain. The town was a prosperous community of farming and ranching, but the atmosphere was already seething with dissidence; winds of rebellion disturbed the people.\n\nTwenty Spanish \"cazadores\" and around fifteen Spanish \"guardia civiles\" had their \"cuartel\" or barracks in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. \"Cazadores\" literally means \"hunters\" their aim was to hunt the Filipino outlaws or dissidents. Across the plaza from the \"cuartel\" was a big convent, made out of adobe stones, 24 meters long and 12 meters wide, and two stories high. Across the plaza from the convent was the \"tribunal\" or municipal hall (site of the present municipal hall building). This \"tribunal\" was made out of adobe stones, ten meters high. A tower was being constructed at the town plaza between the convent and the \"tribunal\". This tower or fort was made of stones, 5 meters square inside dimensions, 3 stories high, and its walls are 1/2 meter thick.\n\nAs insurgency was becoming widespread; the Spaniards adopted measures that increased the number of outlaws. In Northern Zambales (now Western Pangasinan), the leader of the insurgency was Ramon Manalang whose headquarters was in a hideout somewhere in Alaminos, while in San Isidro, the captain of the outlaws was Juanso Viado. The outlaws or dissidents, while numerous, had very few defective guns, and mostly armed with crude sabers, sharp spears and long bolos.\n\nIn February 1898, the outlaws attacked the \"cuartel\" of the Spanish forces in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. The attackers greatly outnumbered the Spaniards, who managed to escape to the big convent across the plaza. The Filipino attackers laid a siege to them, but the Spaniards were able to escape again, now they entrenched themselves deeply to the tower at the middle of the plaza. The people of the town including the \"principales\" and the \"gobernadorcillo\" gone to distant the place. \n\nAfter a siege of two nights and three days, the Spanish forces threw their guns out of the windows of the tower as surrender, mediated by \"Padre\" Mariano Torrente.\n\nThe morning following the surrender, news reached San Isidro that a big Spanish troop, heavily armed had arrived in Alaminos and were on their way to San Isidro, to save the Spaniards. To prevent the escape, they were taken to the forest of Alimpayukan between San Isidro and Balincaguin (now Mabini), where in the forest, Alimpayukan, the Spanish \"cazadores\" and \"guardia civiles\" and including Fr. Torrente and also Fr\".\" Navas of Dasol were blindfolded and their heads cut-off.\n\nShortly after the Spaniards were murdered, the big Spanish troop arrived in San Isidro and encircled the town. There were 20 uniformed Filipino outlaws or insurgents who were to form a local government. These were caught, taken to Mt. Polipol just a few kilometers east from the town, and were shot in a single file. The big Spanish troop burned down the big houses that were owned by the richest and the most influential people of the town.\n\nBecause the Spanish priest of Dasol, \"Padre\" Juan Navas, was beheaded in the forest of Alimpayukan and many of the insurgents were from Dasol, the big Spanish troop proceeded to Dasol, where they killed the \"principales\" and captains, that is, the rich and the influential, and also burned their big houses.\n\nIn March 7, 1898, the small Spanish detachments in the northern towns of Zambales were defeated and around fifty Spanish friars were killed. These were the parish priests of Anda, Balincaguin, Bani, Bolinao, Dasol and San Isidro \"de Potot\".\n\nWhen the Spanish troop had left, the town insurgents returned and established a local \"Katipunan\" Government.\n\nThe \"Katipunan\" Government was functioning smoothly, at least in San Isidro. In November 1900, Gen. Miguel and Don Miguel and Don Mauro Ortiz came to recruit volunteers to fight the Americans in Mangatarem. The volunteers went to Mangatarem, but poorly armed, had to retreat before the heavily armed Americans. They went back across the mountains to Mt. Pita, then went to Infanta, and then back to San Isidro.\n\nThe Americans occupied San Isidro by December 1900 and established peace and order through a policy of attraction. They gave clothes, free goods and tolerated the local customs. American styles of dress influenced the changing of Filipino costumes from oriental to occidental.\n\nIn 1901 a severe storm hit San Isidro, destroying the big convent and the municipal building.\n\nIn 1903, the northern part of Zambales was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan. The municipalities ceded were Alaminos, Bolinao, Anda, Bani, Agno, Infanta and San Isidro \"de Potot\". The municipality of San Isidro at that time included Balincaguin and Dasol.\n\nShortly after the seven towns of Northern Zambales were incorporated to Pangasinan. Balincaguin (1908) and Dasol (1911) seceded from San Isidro \"de Potot\". Balincaguin was renamed as Mabini (in honor of Apolinario Mabini), and San Isidro \"de Potot\" was changed to Burgos (in honor of \"Padre\" José Burgos) in 1913.\n\nDuring the Japanese Occupation in the years 1941-1945, the Japanese soldiers did not much disturbed the barrios of the town, due to Japanese high command to give compulsory contribution of rice and bamboos for their garrison.\n\nThe name of persons who held a leading official position during the Spanish period and thereafter were the following.\n\nGobernadorcillo:\n\n\nThe town of Burgos is home of some natural wonders like white-sand beaches and falls:\n\nIn 1876, the Dominicans created the Parish church of St. Isidore, the patron saint of farmers, seeing that the town's chief industry was farming. The patron's feast is annually celebrated on May 15. It is also the town fiesta.\n\nIt was the founding missionaries who built the present façade of the church, made mostly of quarried adobe stones contributed by the faithful. The Dominicans left during the American regime and were succeeded by Filipino clergymen who continued the improvement of the house of God and the ministration of the faithful. The church edifice, made mostly of quarried adobe stones and rough-hewn lumber, was built through many years.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2069084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069084", "title": "Calasiao", "text": "Calasiao\n\n', officially the ', (; ; ), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe name Calasiao was derived from the native word \"Kalasian\", which means \"a place where lightning frequently occurs\", from the root word \"lasi\", meaning \"lightning\". Upon the arrival of the Spaniards, they called the place \"\"Lugar de Rayos\"\", a literal Spanish translation of the word \"Kalasian\".\n\nIt was named as such because it is said that Calasiao back in the day was always frequented by this natural phenomenon. Today, Calasiao is known as a First Class Municipality and is located at the very heart of Pangasinan. It governs 24 barangays and 31 sitios in a total land area of 4,836 hectares. Calasiao's flagship product is the native rice cake known as Puto Calasiao.\n\nCalasiao is politically subdivided into 24 barangays.\n\n\nThe indigenous people of Calasiao are descended from the Austronesian-speaking people who settled in the Malay archipelago at least 5,000 years ago. Calasiao was settled by a Pangasinan speaking people whose language belongs to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian languages family.\n\nIn 1571, the Spanish conquest of Pangasinan began. The Spanish conquistadors were accompanied by Roman Catholic missionaries who introduced Roman Catholicism to the indigenous peoples of Pangasinan.\n\nIn the 16th century, Dominican friars, who were settling at Gabon, were driven out because of the continuing unrest in the town. The formation of the new Calasiao however was not immediately welcomed by its native inhabitants. Hence in 1660, when the call for the Malong Rebellion came, the citizens picked up their weapons and joined in the fight against the Spanish rule. The citizens were also one of the first people to answer the call for rebellion of Juan de la Cruz Palaris of Binalatongan (now San Carlos City), which succeeded in driving the Spanish rulers and friars out of the boundaries. The town of Calasiao became part of the Pangasinan encomendia of Labaya, designated as belonging to the King of Spain, Juan Ximenez del Pino, and a son of Alonso Hernandez de Sandoval for whom tributes were collected.\n\nToday, Calasiao is rapidly expanding town. It may soon become a city or join with Dagupan City and San Carlos City to be a metropolis. Yet many people from Calasiao have emigrated to other parts of the Philippines, the United States and other countries to seek better opportunities.\n\nThe town hall is located in front of the Roman Catholic convent of San Pedro y San Pablo de Calasiao, the same building as the shrine of Senor Divino Tesoro. The current mayor is Joseph Arman Capito Bauzon, who took over the mayoralty post from Mark Roy Macanlalay, following his victory in the May 2016 elections. \nLike other towns in the Philippines, Calasiao is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the town's departments in executing the ordinances and improving public services. The vice mayor heads a legislative council (Sangguniang Bayan) consisting of councilors from the Barangays of Barrios.\n\nThe town is led by Mayor Joseph Arman Bauzon, Vice Ferdinand Galang, and 10 other councilors.\n\nThe people speak Pangasinan, the dominant language in central Pangasinan. Ilocano, Tagalog, and English are also widely spoken.\n\nCalasiao is a short ride to the Bonuan Blue Beach and the Hundred Islands in the Lingayen Gulf. Calasiao is about 2 hour ride to Baguio City and a four-hour ride to Manila.\n\nCalasiao is known for its puto, a soft rice cake; suman, a sweet coconut and sticky rice cake wrapped in banana leaves; and bagoong, or fermented fish paste. Calasiao puto is described as the town's \"white gold.\" Calasiao \"puto\" is a bite-size, soft rice cake made from semi-glutinous rice that is fermented in earthen jars. It is produced mainly in Barangay Dinalaoan.\n\nMany pilgrims from neighbouring cities/towns and provinces visit Calasiao to pray at the Senor Divino Tesoro shrine. The statue of a crucified Jesus Christ is believed to grow in size and grant miracles.\n\nCalasiao celebrates a puto industry festival. The \"Calasiao puto\" is a rice cake that is well known all over the Philippines for its melt-in-the-mouth feeling. It is locally sold along the streets going to Sr. Divino Tesoro.\n\nIt is known for its \"white gold\": \"cup-shaped, bite-sized, soft rice cakes; the semi-glutinous rice is fermented in old earthen jars\" (in villages of Dinalaoan, Lumbang, Ambuetel, and part of Nalsian).\n\nCalasiao puto is made of long grain rice soaked in water, ground and fermented for three days of more, with just enough sugar to taste, and steamed. It can be topped with cheese or drizzled with chocolate syrup for variation. It is perfect to be paired with dinuguan. The town has the traditional white puto and many flavors like pandan (green), ube (violet), banana (yellow), strawberry (light red/pink) and cheese (gold).\n\nThe original white puto and kutsinta (another rice cake variety) is sold at P80 per kilogram (70 to 75 pieces), while the flavored ones are sold at P80 per kg. The price is higher by P15 to P20 in other areas to cover transportation costs.\n\nBella's Puto consumes three to six sacks of rice a day to make puto, depending on the season. Peak production period is from October to January. A sack of rice can produce 8,000 pieces or 107 kg of puto. Bella's Puto is sold at four SM shopping mall branches, in Santa Mesa (Manila), Baliwag (Bulacan), Clark (Pampanga) and Rosales (Pangasinan).

{"id": "2069085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069085", "title": "Dasol", "text": "Dasol\n\n', officially the ', (; ; ), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nDasol is a popular town for the production of commercial salts. Seawater is fed into large ponds and water is drawn out through natural evaporation which allows the salt to be harvested. Dasol Bay occupies the whole coastline of Dasol and it is where the town gets its saltwater.\n\nDasol is a small town in western Pangasinan, situated in a plateau. It is bounded on the north by the municipalities of Burgos and Mabini, the mineral-rich Zambales mountains in the east, the municipality of Infanta on the south, and the vast South China Sea on the west. It has an area of about 230 square kilometers.\n\nTraversed by the fully paved Olongapo-Bugallon Road, Dasol is north from Manila via Camiling, Tarlac and from Dagupan City. taking the opposite direction via Subic and Olongapo City, Dasol is away from Manila. Dasol can be reached by bus or jeepney trips from Alaminos City and Santa Cruz. Notable bus company Victory Liner. Luzon Cisco Transport. a sister company of Five Star.\n\nThe town got its name from the medicinal herb \"dosol\" which abound in the locality during the Spanish period. The leaves of this herbal plant are greenish and oval in shape. It is a tuber relatively very low in height. It was commonly used to cure infected wounds, but was found to have the unusual characteristic of miraculously disappearing (abandoning its post) for unknown reason never to be located again. Its name was frequently mispronounced as Dasol by the Spaniards, so that when the place was established as municipality in the 19th Century, Dasol became its official name.\n\nOn November 7, 1903, the northern part of Zambales was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan. The municipalities ceded were Alaminos, Bolinao, Anda, San Isidro de Putot, Bani, Agno, and Infanta. Townsfolk cited alleged lack of concern for the towns' interest and welfare by the Zambales provincial government and was encouraged to join Pangasinan province. However, for allegedly the same reason, there was a movement to rejoin Zambales, which clamor was aroused by the incumbency of then President Ramon Magasaysay, a Zambales-born president in the middle of the 1950s. This proposal was wiped out completely when Governor Aguedo Agbayani of Pangasinan became the governor.\n\nAs early as 1878, Dasol was not as a municipality as it is now, but was part of San Isidro de Putot municipality which also include the present municipalities of Mabini (at that time was named as Barrio Balincaguin), and Burgos. At that time, there were few people lived in Dasol. Balincaguin was the most thickly populated barrio and later became an independent municipality. The people, in their desire for better living conditions, moved to the south-west. They found good fishing grounds and they decided to stay along the coast in the barrio of Uli, Dasol. In 1911, by virtue of Executive Order No. 25, signed by Governor General William Cameron Forbes, Dasol seceded from San Isidro de Putot, San Isidro de Putot was renamed as Burgos (in honor of José Apolonio Burgos) and Balincaguin was renamed as Mabini (in honor of Apolinario Mabini).\n\nEver since its creation, the boundaries of Dasol with the municipalities of Burgos, Mabini and Infanta remain vague, for what the leaders of Dasol had claimed to be the boundaries then agreed upon and as allegedly borne out by records, are no longer respected by the respective officials of said adjoining municipalities. Instead, they have encroached into Dasol's domain. During the incumbency of Mayor Liceralde, he made an attempt to settle Dasol's boundary with Mabini, but even after two separate conferences between the officials of the two towns were already had, each group was adamant in its own version. Considering that there was no visible sign of a probability for an amicable settlement of the dispute, the idea was abandoned so as to give way to court battle. He allegedly said that it was time-consuming to gather relevant documentary evidence (parol evidence no longer available due to the death of reliable witnesses) that would clinch the case for Dasol. The same appears to be true with respect to the other boundary conflicts.\n\nA revolutionary group was organized in the Central Luzon on January 14, 1898, under General Francisco Macabulos. The Pangasinan sub-group was headed by Vicente del Prado, who together with Daniel Maramba reached an understanding to launch an attack on Spanish situations. On March 7, 1898, a simultaneous attack was suddenly made upon convents in number of towns of western Pangasinan (then as northern Zambales). Areas of San Isidro de Putot, Dasol (proper), and Eguia were among attacked. The Spanish detachments in these towns and around fifty Spanish friars were defeated.\n\nDasol Bay has been witness to several naval battles in World War II. On August 23, 1944, while searching for new targets, the American submarines USS Harder and USS Hake were attacked by Kaibokan CD-22 and PB-102 (ex-USS Stewart (DD-224)). Thinking that it was just a Japanese minesweeper and a three-stack Siamese destroyer Phra Ruang, the Japanese vessel operated in consort with the anti-submarine vessel attacked and sank USS Harder through a technique known as a depth charge attack. USS Hake was also attacked but escaped and arrived at Fremantle Harbor, Australia on September 24, 1944.\n\nOn November 6, 1944, while guarding convoy Ma-Ta 31, Japanese cruiser Kumano was attacked by a US submarine wolf-pack consisting of the \"Batfish, Guitarro, Bream, Raton and the Ray\". In all, the American submarines launched 23 torpedoes towards the convoy, two of which struck the Kumano. The first hit destroyed the ship's recently replaced bow, and the second damaged its starboard engine room. Kumano escaped and was towed to Dasol Bay by the cargo ship Doryo Maru, and from there the ship was moved to the beach and underwent repairs. On November 25, 1944, Kumano came under aerial attack by aircraft launched by the USS Ticonderoga. Five torpedoes and four 500 pound bombs struck the ship, and rolled over and sank in about 31 m (100 ft) of water.\n\nNo record has been found regarding the reign of a governardorcillo in this municipality but records show that there was already an organized government, with Santos Jimenez, Vicente Liceralde, Gaspar Estrada and Pedro Estrada as early capitan municipáles.\n\nCornelio Estrada was the capitan municipál from 1898 until 1900. At the height of the Katipunan resistance against the Americans, Francisco Bernal was the capitan municipál.\n\nDuring the time San Isidro Putot was established, the town had been under three rulers, who ruled in different terms, namely: Lucas Bonilla (1899–1901), Nazario Nacar (1901–1903), and Paulino Mendoza (1904–1908).\n\nWhen Dasol municipality was created, Apolonio Casipit was its first president. He was succeeded by Leandro Cristobal from 1912 to 1916. Calixto Tobias was the municipal president from 1916. In 1918, Tobias was assassinated by an unknown assailant. His unexpired term was served by his vice mayor, Severino delos Reyes. In the following election, Apolonio Casipit won and served his second term from 1918 to 1920. Succeeding him was Pedro dela Rosa from 1921 to 1925.\n\nIn the years 1925 to 1932, Marcelo Jimenez was elected and served for two consecutive terms. In the following election, Flaviano Cristobal served as the last Municipal President from 1932 to 1935. He was elevated as Dasol's first Municipal Mayor, when the Commonwealth Government was established. He was followed by Juan Castro (1937–1939). Mayor Castro failed to serve the entire period of his term due to health conditions making his vice mayor, Emiliana R. Jimenez as Acting Municipal Mayor for the unexpired term (1940). In the next election, Flaviano Cristobal ran again and won, making him as the Municipal Mayor of Dasol at the outbreak of the second world war. He was forced to vacate the office in 1944 when he joined guerilla movement intervention. His vice mayor, Teodoro Milgar served as acting mayor for the unexpired term. When Philippine Independence came in 1946, Marcelo A. Jimenez was appointed by President Roxas as Acting Municipal Mayor. Like Mayor Castro, Mayor Jimenez failed to serve the entire period of his term in the same year.\n\nIsidro Bustria served the unexpired term of Marcelo A. Jimenez from 1946 until 1948. In the 1948 election, Damaso E. Rivera won and served as municipal mayor. In 1950, Rivera failed to finish his term and his vice mayor, Segundo Basuel, served his unexpired term. In 1952, Cristino R. Jimenez won and served for four consecutive terms (1952–1967), winning three re-elections. In 1968, Ramon G. Liceralde won as mayor. 1976 local elections was suspended due to the existence of martial law. Liceralde, was so far the only lawyer-mayor of Dasol. In 1978, Benjamin Ochotorena was appointed Municipal Mayor until 1980. Ludovico R. Espinosa was elected and served as mayor from July 1980 until the government reorganization on June 10, 1986, by President Corazon Aquino. Manuel Bunao was appointed OIC Mayor from June 16, 1986, to November 17, 1986. Espinosa appealed and he was reinstalled on November 18, 1986. In June 1988, he was elected and served a new mandate. In the May 11, 1992 elections, Espinosa was defeated by Sergio N. Jimenez. Jimenez also defeated Espinosa in two successive elections (1995,1998). Due to term limits set by the Philippine Local Government Code of 1991, Sergio Jimenez gave way to his wife, Angelita Ocampo-Jimenez to run for the 2001 elections. Mrs. Jimenez won beating Vice Mayor Moises Alejos. In the 2004 elections, Mrs. Jimenez won her second term unchallenged. In the 2007 elections, Councilor Noel Nacar challenged Jimenez and won as new mayor of Dasol. He then served for three consecutive terms. In the 2016 elections, Nacar had his daughter run for mayor as his successor but was defeated by Eric Verzosa, son of former PNP Director General Jesus Verzosa.\n\nThe town, however, suffered a black eye in the matter of peace and order. In the 1950s, insurgency surfaced, the first of its kind. The HUKBALAHAP made a surprise when it raid the municipal hall on August 25, 1950, and burned it into ashes. At the same the mayor's residence was raided causing him to leave the remainder of his term to his vice mayor. The so-called revolutionary taxes were being exacted and secretly collected from residents that the collectors presumed to be well-to-do. Rallies and meetings of activists waving red flaglets were held time and again in the public plazas castigating the municipal and provincial officials and its established government. Paved roads, plaza concrete fences, even school fences were painted in red thee emblem of communism and painted in black the human skull just below the word \"DEMOCRACY\".\n\nCertain residents including some public officials were actively involved. At long last, the military came to encamp so that the rallies were quelled and vandalism stopped. But secret activities of the insurgent civilians perpetrated anywhere in populated places or inside private dwellings. It would seem that insurgency was not all to blame. Common criminality and vindictiveness could have motivated some or many of the killings. No less than twenty fresh human lives (civilians, police and military) perished with their assailants unknown one of it was the killing of a retired us major bonus who's attackers are unknown. Ambuscades were staged along highways and other roadways one of the most famous was the ambush of seven people and keep it alongside of a paved road. Even private residences were invaded fearlessly to insure the killing of the intended victim. Even Mayor Espinosa at that time was not spared when about ten of his cows inside their \"koral\" one evening were gunned simultaneously.\n\nDasol is politically subdivided into 18 barangays.\n\nDasol had seven barrios (now called barangay) when it was created. These were Tambobong, Tanobong, Uli, Malacapas, Bongalon, Alilao and Poblacion. Eguia was then part of Infanta and was annexed to Dasol in 1925. As years went by and due to its increasing population, two more barrios were created. Eguia was divided to form other three barangays namely Macalang, Viga and Tambac. Then came the time when Tambobong was to create Magsaysay and Tanobong (Malimpin) was divided to create San Vicente. Later, Bongalon (Hermosa) was divided to create Petal out of its two sitios Penec and Espital and from Alilao, two more barangays were formed now known as Amalbalan and Gais-Guipe. The sitios of Macalang, Pantol, Tapac and Pagdagaan were constituted into a barrio of Macalang by virtue of Republic Act 1707.\n\nThe basic livelihood of the town includes salt making, small scale fishing, bagoong making, charcoal making, fruitwine making, and farming (mostly rice crops).\n\nAn average family raises only PhP 5,561.67 and spends PhP 4,506.58 mostly for basic needs.\n\nMajority of Dasol's income came from commercial salt making, with 14 major salt producers in the municipality.\n\nDasol is rich in non-metallic resources.

The photos have been called both graphically poignant and emotionally and visually thought-provoking.\n\nTo reinforce this imagery, the band placed mellow musical interludes at certain parts of the album – tracks 3 and 10 – to cause of a sudden mood of reflection before and after the savagery of the hardcore songs which dominate this recording.\n\nThe record release show for this album coincided with the Back to School Jam 3 on October 30th, 1999 in Worcester, Massachusetts at the Palladium.

It is also the birthplace of former President Fidel V. Ramos.\n\nThe Augustinian missionaries and the Spanish conquistadores drew a plan of Lingayen in 1614 and Lingayen was founded. The founders named the town Lingayen at the suggestion of natives themselves, due to a certain corpulent tamarind tree growing on the present town plaza at that time. The tree was exceptionally big, tall, and spreading; that the surrounding trees were just drafts in comparison. Passers-by developed the habit of looking back and back again at this corpulent tree until it would vanish from their rear view. When they arrived home and were asked what way they took in returning they would simply say \"through Liñgayen\". The word \"Liñgayen\" was from the Pangasinan language word \"lingawen\" meaning \" to look back\". Since then up to the present time the town bears its name as Lingayen.\n\nLingayen became the capital of Pangasinan when the province became an encomienda.\n\nDuring World War II, Lingayen was where the Allied armies landed during the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf.

It was originally called \"Balincaguin\" that was derived from the Zambal phrase \"\"Bali Lan Caguin\"\" which means \"adobe of bats\". This name referred to the nocturnal mammals (bats) that inhabited the caves found in the hills and mountains between the municipality and Zambales in the west and Tarlac to the south-west.\n\nThe place may have been founded in 1610 by Spanish missionaries who were Augustinian Recollects, although this is uncertain. In 1800, Balincaquin became a town under Don Isidro Puzon who is believed to be the founder. Some of its population (770 families) were Ilocanos who moved to the municipality due to its agricultural health. The site where these settlers situated near the mountains used to be called \"Conventa.\"\n\nGood quality rice was then consistently produced and marketed to Manila and even to China. Other products such as corn, sugar cane, cotton and so forth were also demanded and consequently, distributed widely through numerous markets. Apart from agriculture, the industry of saddle-making, knapsack-making and hat-weaving existed. The residents also engaged in tending cattle, carabaos, horses and goats. At the same time, gradual increase of the number of bats compelled the residents to catch them. These mammals were suspected of flying through the nearby forests because of the catching that lasted until 1930.\n\nIn 1930, the town's name was changed to Mabini in honor of Apolinario Mabini, who was considered as \"The Great Sublime Paralytic\" and \"Brains of the Revolution.\"\n\nThe municipality was merged with Alaminos, Bani, Anda, Dasol, Burgos, Bolinao and Infanta in 1904 and presently comprises the province's first district.\n\nThe municipal heads from the time when it was founded up to the present.\n\n"}

It is also famous for its mango fruits having one of the largest concentration of mango tree population in the Philippines.\n\nThe word Malasiqui originates from the Pangasinan root word \"lasi\" meaning lightning. With prefix \"ma\" indicating high degree and suffix \"qui\" indicating place - Malasiqui means \"place full of lightning\".\n\nThe municipality traces its origins during the middle of the 17th century when Spanish friars opened a mission intended to convert the native population to Catholicism. The most probable founding year was 1671 when Spanish civil authorities in Manila gave the license for the creation of the town. There were no organized communities in the area before the Spaniards arrived. Attempts to group families into a settlement may have started as early as 1665. The present site was then heavily forested with small family groups scattered along banks of small rivers and creeks. The socio-political history of the municipality parallels that of the Pangasinan province and the country in general. Its history is punctuated by periods of foreign domination first by the Spanish, then by the United States and briefly by the Japanese during the 2nd World War. The population participated heavily in some of the bloodiest rebellions during the Spanish period. Catholicism and other Christian sects dominate the religious life of the people. Ethnically, it is one of the few places in the province of Pangasinan which did not experience in-migration from other regions of the country. Consequently, Pangasinanse is the dominant ethnic group with almost no other ethnic groups mixing into the locality.\n\nThe poblacion or town center, is recently experiencing high commercial growth spurred mainly by high consumer spending generated by increase in family incomes attributable to earnings of OFWs (Overseas Filipino Workers). The estimate of OFW population as a percentage of adult labor force is as much as 22% - one of the highest rates in the Philippines. The OFW phenomenon is so significant that almost all households have at least one member working outside of the country.\n\nThe composition of the Municipal Government of Malasiqui as of June 30, 2019\n\nMalasiqui is politically subdivided into 73 barangays.\n\nThe Town Fiesta is celebrated January 17 thru 22 every year.

{"id": "2069121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069121", "title": "Saya San", "text": "Saya San\n\nSaya San also spelled Hsaya (original name Yar Kyaw, , ; 24 October 1876 – 28 November 1931) was a physician, former monk and the leader of the 'Saya San Rebellion' of 1930-1932 in British Burma. The series of uprisings that have been called the 'Saya San rebellion' has been regarded as one of Southeast Asia's quintessential anti-colonial movements. Because of its national and historical nature, discussions about Saya San and the rebellion associated with him has persisted to this day, particularly within academic spheres.\n\nSaya San was a native of Shwebo, a centre of nationalist-monarchist sentiment in north-central Burma that was the birthplace of the Konbaung (or Alaungpaya) dynasty, which controlled Myanmar from 1752 until the British annexation in 1886. He was born on 24 October 1876. His original name was Yar Kyaw. His parents were U Kyaye and Daw Hpet, who lived with their five children in the rural agricultural village of Thayetkan. Yar Kyaw was exposed to Buddhist tenets at an early age by studying at the local village monastery. Then he continued his studies at the nearby Hpo Hmu monastery until he was nearly twenty years old. Yar Kyaw left for the village of Nga Kaung Inn soon after with a hope that he could make a better living selling mats and baskets as an alternative to working in the agricultural sector. Eventually, he met and married Ma Kay, and had two children, Ko Po Thin and Ma Sein. As economic condition failed to improve, Yar Kyaw left for Moulmein in Lower Burma, where employment opportunities were better because of the expansion of the rice frontier. Earning his living as a carpenter for some time and then more successfully as a fortuneteller and traditional healer, he wrote two treatises on traditional healing practices that questioned the authority and efficacy of Western medical treatment.\n\nThe transition Saya San made from a medical man to a political activist is not very clear. People tend to believe that he joined the General Council of Burmese Associations (GCBA) led by U Soe Thein in 1920s. He began his political career as a representative of his village and soon progressed to lead his township and district branch of Moulmein. In 1924, at the annual congress of the GCBA, 45-year-old Saya San was elected to chair a commission to survey the living conditions of the Burmese peasantry.\n\nIn late December 1930, Saya San organized peasant revolt and proclaimed himself a pretender to the throne who, like Alaungpaya, would unite the people and expel the British invader. He organized his followers into the “Galon Army” and he was proclaimed “king” at Insein, near Rangoon (Yangon). Quickly, the rebellion drew colonial authority's attention and was suppressed by British army. As the revolt collapsed, Saya San fled to the Shan Plateau in the east. By August 1931, however, he was captured at Hokho and brought back to Tharrawaddy. He was tried and sentenced by a Special Rebellion Tribunal. Despite the efforts of his lawyer, Ba Maw, he was executed on November 28, 1931.\n\nBriefly, the imperial history of Burma had sustained almost eight centuries. In the 9th century the Tibeto-Burman speaking Burmese, began migrating to the Irrawaddy valley from present-day Yunnan's Nanzhao kingdom and then established the Pagan Kingdom in 1057. Pagan's power slowly waned in the 13th century. Kublai Khan's Mongol forces invaded northern Burma and sacked Pagan city itself, the kingdom fall in 1287. In the second half of the 16th century, the Taungoo Dynasty reunified the country, and founded the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia for a brief period. In the 18th century, the Konbaung Dynasty restored the kingdom, and went to war with all its neighbors. The kingdom fought three wars with the British. In 1885, the kingdom was conquered, and the King Thebaw, was deported to India. Eventually, Burma was annexed into British rule in 1886, but the more difficult task of maintaining stability remained, as British authorities immediately faced a number of uprisings that erupted throughout the formal Burmese Kingdom.\n\nBy the 1890s, colonial officials had determined that the main pacification campaigns were successful, and they could concentrate on the business of building a social-economic infrastructure that could support their interest in the vast teak, mineral, and agricultural resources that their new colony provided. Attached as a province of India, British Burma would be subject to administrative policies established in New Delhi as well as the vast array of procedural structures that characterized the India Civil Service. The new territories were divided into districts and assigned a commissioner with a small support staff. Through the prism and experience of British India, Burmese people, cultures, languages and histories were constructed by imperial surveys that now sought to map the new territories. Indigenous healing practices, rituals, folktales, notions of authority and village life would be organized and categorized according to how well the district officer understood what he was observing. Moreover, when the British Indian authorities destroyed the kingdom of Burma in 1885-1886, they transferred the Burmese royal throne to a museum in Calcutta. Meanwhile, the Palace of Mandalay was converted into the British Upper Burma Club, disregarding its immense cosmological importance to the Burmese. In other words, the colonial rule had changed the social landscape of ancient Burma in a manner that caused much resentment.\n\nThe British had faced numerous outbreaks of resistance throughout 1886-1890. These opposition movements became more intensive and extensive. Some of these rebellions were led by former members of the court, like the Myinzaing Prince, who continued to wield considerable influence over troops and villagers in provincial centers that had once been in alliance with the throne. Other pockets of resistance were led by local headmen and monks but were limited by size and scope. These were often short-lived either due to lack of support or the overwhelming technical advantage of the British.\n\nIn the late 1890s, a small group of Buddhist associations with contemporary forms of organization and structure were founded by lay members in an effort to preserve the religion and its place in society.\n\nIn 1906, political organizations such as the Young Men's Buddhist Association (YMBA) came into prominence within Rangoon, drawing young clerks and educated elites into working for changes in colonial society through accepted and approved channels. The YMBA focused on improving social conditions and concentrating on educational government on issue of cultural identity. This would pave the way for formation of the General Council of Burmese Associations (GCBA) which planned to participate more directly in political protest and demonstrations. In order to engage rural communities, members of GCBA would travel into the countryside conducting interviews, collecting data, and filling reports to establish lines of communication with emerging village activists. Saya San joined the GCBA and worked in the countryside for more than two years, so he was familiar with rural places and had direct connections with peasants.\n\nIn October 1930, there had been earthquakes at Pegu and Pyu. These were heralded as portents, recalling prophesies that the throne of the King of Burma would not remain unoccupied. At the auspicious moment, the coronation of Saya San proceeded in the traditional manner, at a pagoda near Rangoon. Saya San was proclaimed the Thupannaka Galon Raja, and donned the royal raiments prescribed by ancient usage. On 21 December 1930, the Galon Raja moved to his palace on Alaungtang Hill in Tharrawaddy, where a royal city, known as Buddharaja Myo, or “Buddhist King’s Town”, was ceremonially plotted out. The new king disposed of the proper retinue of five queens, four ministers, and four regiments. Saya San promised supporters that he would restore the authority of the Burmese monarchy, revitalize the Buddhist religion and expel the British. Also, he assured his oath-bound followers that they would be protected by his magical charms and tattoos.\n\nOn the night of 22 December the first outbreak occurred in the Tharrawaddy district. Tharrawaddy, like most of Lower Burma, suffered severe economic dislocation during the ‘Hoover Slump’. The Great Depression of 1930 had a devastating impact on rice prices. Rice was Burma's most important export commodity and its fortunes on commercial markets affected much of the rural population. The high population density in central Burma and the concentration of land ownership in fewer hands created a large number of disaffected landless laborers increasingly aggrieved with colonial government, whom they lamed both their inability to work the land independently and for decline of their real incomes as rice worker. Thus, rural cultivators, already frustrated by the drop of the price of rice were quick to respond to Saya San's appeals involving a mixture of anti-tax rhetoric, Buddhist prophecies and guarantees of invulnerability.\n\nIn a few weeks it became clear that the violence that began in Tharrawaddy had escalated. The British authority, officials in New Delhi were soon asked by their Rangoon counterparts to dispatch armed forces to quell the rebellion. However, the military support did not produce immediate results. The outbreaks continued to spread in neighboring districts. The rebellion spread to the districts of Pyapon, Henzada, Insein, Pegu, Toungoo, Prome, Thayetmyo, Naungcho Township, and the Northern Shan States. Other rebellion leaders such as U Aung Hla, Bo Aung Shwe, and Bo Aung Pe led uprisings in neighboring districts to secure weapons, raid police stations, and attack government representatives.\n\nWithin weeks of the first outbreak, Rangoon authorities responded by seeking special emergency power from India. By June 1931, a Special Rebellion Commissioner, Mr. Booth Gravely, was appointed to manage affairs in Burma. In July 1931, the authorities considered the situation so serious that they (unsuccessfully) asked permission from the government of India to introduce martial law. By August 1931, Saya San was captured. By then, the rebellion had gone on for nearly two years.\n\nThe revolt was crushed, and the casualties were not much certain. By the end of 1932, more than 1000 rebels were killed and a further 9000 rebels were surrendered or captured. Saya San and 125 other rebels were hanged and almost 1400 were sentenced to terms of imprisonment or of transportation.\n\nSaya San took the name of the Thupannaka Galon Raja. This name could be understood in three dimensions within the Burmese context.\n\nThe Galon, is a well-recognized figure in the literature of Hindu-Buddhist Southeast Asia. Galon was a fabulous bird of Hindu mythology. It is often depicted in combat with the Nāga. This cosmic battle between \"galon\" and \"nāga\" would come to represent ideas about the power of nature, the dualities of the world, and the challenges of the human conditions.\n\nFirst, after British rule has arrived, the Nāga was generally recognized as the symbol for the British, while the Galon stood for Burma. Thus in one sense, the Galon was a triumphant symbol of resistance or anti-British sentiment, as the Galon is the vanquisher of the Nāga.\n\nSecondly, The Galon-Nāga symbolism also had other meanings. In Eastern mythology, the Galon represents the sun-force or solar energy, in natural opposition to the liquid quality of earthly waters. The Nāga is an earth symbol that, in its embodiment in serpentine form, partakes of the magical symbolic properties of liquids. The liquid of the serpent is especially fascinating because it is a poison. The Galon is the killer of serpents, and thus the possessor of supernatural power against all forms of lethal poison. Therefore, it is not surprising that most Burmans regarded certain tattoos as effective protection against snakebite. Perhaps at some time in history the tattoo dyes or needles had some genuine medicinal property. On this count we can only speculate, but, in any case, it was a well-entrenched article of Burmese belief. Thus the Galon itself was a symbol or effecter of invulnerability.\n\nThe Galon has a third vital symbolic role: in most depictions, the Galon is a vehicle for Vishnu, one of three great deities of the Brahmanic universe. Therefore, the Galon is also regarded a super-potent, triple-threat protector.\n\nDiscussions about the Saya San Rebellion often revolve around its causes and characters. Scholars have studied on it and produced several interpretations in order to locate Saya San's position in Burmese history and examine the rebellion from different aspects.\n\nOn the eve of the rebellion, the leading Burmese newspaper, Thu-ri-ya (The Sun) had published an article “A Warning to the British Government” which spoke of Burma as a “keg of dynamite” which could explode at any time.\n\nThe British government had recorded this event into a report “The Origin and Causes of the Burma Rebellion (1930-1932)”, which was published by 1934. It became the fundamental resource for over eighty years. According to the report： \"As regards the causes it is well known: (1) that the Burman is by nature restless and excitable; (2) that in spite of a high standard of literacy the Burman peasantry are incredibly ignorant and superstitious…\" Thus, to the authorities, the rebellion could be explained with the framework of superstition. In addition, it rejected any political causes for the rebellion.\n\nD.G.E. Hall, one of the pioneers of writing history on Southeast Asia, who is also a famous British Burma historian, disagrees with the reports’ finding. In terms of the cause of the rebellion, he posited political factors rather than economic ones. However, he also recognized the economic discontent. While some scholars have suggested that economic hardship was at the heart of the revolts, others have suggested that initiating a new golden age of Buddhism was an important reason. After the independence of Burma, historians tend to analyze the rebellion in more diverse perspectives.\n\nFor those Burmese historians, Saya San was portrayed as an early nationalist hero. These interpretations stressed on economic factors, which was the cause of popular dissatisfaction. Different from the British discourse, the economic grievances could be the base of the movement. The movement was not aimless, instead, it was rational and justifiable.\n\nJohn Cady is the first western historian to term the rebellion the “Saya San rebellion”. He used a vast amount of British documents, including parliamentary papers and police reports, to create a narrative by recognizing the localized form of political expression. In his book A history of modern Burma, he wrote\"...it was a deliberately planned affair based on traditional Burmese political and religious patterns.”\n\nThere are also researches that focus on the economic perspective. Written a generation later and no doubt infused with the intellectual currents that informed both peasant studies and Southeast Asian studies, Michael Adas' The Burma delta (1974)amazon and James C. Scott's The moral economy of the peasant: Rebellion and subsistence in Southeast Asia (1976)amazon and Ian Brown's A colonial economy in crisis: Burma's rice cultivators and the world depression of the 1930s (2005)amazon provided in-depth analyses into the economic conditions underlying the uprisings in the 1930s. For these scholars (like their earlier Burmese colleagues), the traditional vocabulary of the rebellion was less a factor in the cause of the insurgency than the unforgiving demands of the rational state's economy.\n\nOne can also consider E. Manuel Sarkisyanz’s Buddhist Background of the Burmese Revolution employed the idea of Buddhist millenarian to examine the Saya San rebellion. It represented a transition from those earlier studies which trapped in a context of colonialism or nationalism to those discourses which paid attention to the cultural ideas within a more indigenous context.\n\nFrom 1970s onwards, the “autonomous history” seems to become the tendency of historiography, which reconstructed those historical figures and events by analyzing indigenous culture from the local people's point of view. Another important book regarding Saya San is Michael Adas’s Prophet of Rebellion. On the one hand, Adas emphasized that a ‘Prophetic leader’ has ability to start up a millenarian movement. He also provides four other examples to justify his theory in bigger colonial situations.\n\nMaitrii Aung-Thwin's book, “The Return of the Galon King: history, law, and rebellion in colonial Burma.” offers a critical assessment of the history and impact of the narrative of the Saya San revolt, an event taken as formative for Burmese history and studies of peasant rebellion worldwide. This work shows that despite all efforts to write social science objectively, ideology still rules.\n\nWhile those interpretations have emerged, scholarship has raised many questions about Saya San's role in the revolt. For example, if the British falsified and overstated Saya San's role in the revolt so as to make his execution seem more meaningful than it actually was. Several details of the trial, including a diary produced by the police which outlines Saya San's plan, are not considered to be trustworthy.\n\nThis is a timeline of the rebellion as outlined by historian Parimal Ghosh.\n\n1930\n\n1931\n\nThe Saya San rebellion was one of the greatest anti-colonial movements in Southeast Asia in the 20th century, leaving thousands of people dead by the time it had concluded. However, the legacy left behind is that he is still regarded as a national hero to this day, a figure for national unity, and he has even been immortalized in the Burmese banknote. \nThe Saya San rebellion is useful because it can help us to understand other revolts and revolutions throughout Southeast Asia especially during the colonial period. The Saya San rebellion case-study demonstrates how contesting historiographies do have an effect on the production of history. Because the colonial narrative formed the dominant discourse of the period, that discourse was able to control the narratives based on the archival data, despite them being biased and framed from only the colonial perspective. In other words, the so-called official archives about the Saya San rebellion did not tell us much about the rebellion, except for the administrative context that combined mostly only disciplines of ethnology, law and geography to reconstruct the narrative.\n\nConsider the Thai Nguyen rebellion or the Tinh Soviet movement that were also happening around the same time as the Saya San rebellion. There were also other sources that could allow us to acquire different perspectives. David Marr writing on Vietnam posits a 'Resistance model' or schema. According to him, there is traditional resistance, typically led by scholar elites. Following this there is a transitional resistance, led by scholar elites trying to be progressive. Finally there is the modern resistance, led by Western-educated leaders. When we overlay the Saya San narrative over David Marr's model of resistance, we can see that the Saya San movement contains elements of both traditional and modernity encapsulated within its nature. James Scott, in writing about revolts in Vietnam and Burma during the early 1900s, comments that these movements are not so much about objective economic conditions, but rather subjective economic conditions. He points to an idealized moral economy that existed before the Western colonial rule, where wealth was re-distributed, with reciprocal rights and obligations that linked village elites with the village people. With the arrival of colonial rule, the people that were able to survive from the distributive networks are thus unable to carry on their livelihoods like before.\nOther than framing the rebellion in terms of tradition or modernity, another way of looking at the rebellion is from the perspectives of violence, ideology, and utopia. For example, we can focus on how violence determined the contours of the movement, and also how ideological amalgamated with visions of utopia in the leaders moulded the eventual outcome of the movement.\n\nBut can we consider the rebellion to be successful? Does the death of Saya San necessarily mean it was unsuccessful? At that point, to the colonial administrators, it does seem to have been an unsuccessful rebellion. However, the future repercussions were strong. In fact, two years after his capture, the movement still continued. At the same time, Saya San today still evokes sentiments of nationalism, if not patriotism. Also, despite him existing in the modern period, post-colonial narratives still continue to focus on the superstitious aspects such as the tattoos and amulets that he and his people used.\n\nPerhaps what future generations can learn about from the Saya San rebellion is to never assume the complete legitimacy of a source simply because it is the dominant discourse. It could have political repercussions, but it is still useful to always re-examine sources, perspectives, narratives, and historiographies to tease out certain insinuations or biases. Once a re-reading is done, more comprehensive viewpoints whether retrospective or not, could literally change the future. As George Orwell puts it, \"He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.\"\n\n\n"}

Its land area is 8,965 hectares.\n\nPozorrubio is from Manila and is from the provincial capital, Lingayen.\n\"Claris\" or Pozorrubio became a Municipio on January 13, 1870. It was formerly a settlement and later a Barangay of San Jacinto, Pangasinan.\n\nWealthy landowners, Don Benito Magno, Domingo Aldana, Pedro Itliong, Bartolome Naniong, Bernardo Olarte, Pedro Salcedo, Juan Ancheta, Antonio Sabolboro, Jose Songcuan, Tobian Paragas, Francisco Callao and Baltazar Casiano y Salazar filed the June 19, 1868, Petition addressed to the Philippine Governor General de la Torre thru the Pangasinan \"Alcalde Mayor\" for conversion of Barrio Claris. The request was granted on November 3, 1869.\n\nParish Priest, another Dominican, Rev. Fr. Asencio and Lingayen Seňor Domingo Castro filed petitions to the Governor-General). The name Claris was derived from Juan dela Cruz Palaris, the leader of the 1762 Spain revolt of Binalatongan (San Carlos). Claris was named in honor of Palaris, king of Pangasinan. Father Asencio suggested Pozorrubio to honor Governor-General dela Torre alias Conde de Pozor-the Count of Pozor, adding RUBIO.\n\nDon Benito, Sr. Domingo Castro, Don Domingo Aldana and DonAgustin Venezuela, proceeded to Manila by carruaje (stagecoach pulled by four horses) to deliver the second petition to the Queen of Spain was Isabel II, which was granted on August 13, 1868.\n\nSanta Philomena beame the Town's Patron Saint with feast day of August 13. She is, as believed by her devotees within the Catholic Church, a young virgin martyr whose remains were discovered in 1802 in the Catacombs of Priscilla. Three tiles enclosing the tomb bore an inscription that was taken to indicate that her name (in the Latin of the inscription) was Filumena, the English form of which is Philomena.\n\nThe remains were removed to Mugnano del Cardinale in 1805 and became the focus of widespread devotion, with several miracles credited to the saint's intercession, including the healing of Venerable Pauline Jaricot in 1835, which received wide publicity. Saint John Vianney attributed to her intercession the extraordinary cures that others attributed to himself.\n\nThe town's 12 intelligentsia formed the Communidad or Town Council (Tribunal or Presidencia, the Town Hall):\n\n\nDon Benito Magono was elected on November 3, 1868, as first Gobernadorcillo on January 1, 1869, with seat of government at Barrio of Claris, now Barangay Amagbagan. Don Jose Sanchez and Don Agustin Venezuela donated the plaza lot.\n\nSan Jacinto Kura Paroko, Fr. Pablo Almazan appointed Dona Francisca Aldana-Magno, the wife of Don Benito, to teach in the only school set up in Claris. The town was relocated to Cablong. On December 18, 1880, Gobernadorcillo, Don Bernardo Olarte, inaugurated the new site with new Parish Priest, the Rev. Fr. Joaquin Gonzales, with a brand-new church and a kumbento.\n\nThe Japanese commandos in 1942 executed Attorney Filomeno G. Magno, the direct heirs of Don Benito Magno, 1st Gobernadorcilo and anak banus founder of Pozorrubio. Don Benito Estaris Magno's mother, Doňa Maria Estaris (Akolaw Inkew) was Benito's first teacher and his wife Doňa Francisca Aldana, was also a teacher in Claris. Don Benito organized a new town (independent from San Jacinto ) barrio Claris (now Barangay Amagbagan), in 1867. It included barangays Nantangalan, Maambal, Bantugan, Dilan, Malasin, and Talogtog.\n\nOn April 19, 2012, Oscar V. Cruz announced that the aswang (Philippine ghoul) believed to have appeared in Barangay Villegas, Pozorrubio was not true.\n\nThe chief executives of the town are Mayor Artemio Q. Chan and Vice Mayor Ernesto T. Go, with eight Sangguniang Bayan members or councilors who hold office at the Town Hall and Legislative Building's Session Hall.\n\nPozorrubio is politically subdivided into 34 barangays.\n\n\nThe town's prime school is the Benigno V Aldana National High School (BVANHS, formerly Pozorrubio High School).\n\nThe town's interesting points and events include:\n\n\nThe 1880 St. Jude Thaddeus Parish Church (Feast Day: October 28; Parish Priest: Father Teofilo L.

{"id": "2069127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069127", "title": "Santo Daime", "text": "Santo Daime\n\nSanto Daime ( is a syncretic religion founded in the 1930s in the Brazilian Amazonian state of Acre by Raimundo Irineu Serra, known as Mestre Irineu. Santo Daime incorporates elements of several religious or spiritual traditions including Folk Catholicism, Kardecist Spiritism, African animism and indigenous South American shamanism, including \"vegetalismo\".\n\nCeremonies — \"trabalhos\" (Brazilian Portuguese for \"works\") — are typically several hours long and are undertaken sitting in silent \"concentration\", or sung collectively, dancing according to simple steps in geometrical formation. Ayahuasca, referred to as Daime within the practice, which contains several psychoactive compounds, is drunk as part of the ceremony. The drinking of Daime can induce a strong emetic effect which is embraced as both emotional and physical purging.\n\nSanto Daime churches promote a wholesome lifestyle in conformity with Irineu's motto of \"harmony, love, truth and justice\", as well as other key doctrinal values such as strength, humility, fraternity and purity of heart. The practice became a worldwide movement in the 1990s.\n\nSanto Daime, sometimes called simply the 'Doctrine of Mestre Irineu', is the name given to the religious practice begun in the 1920s in the far western Brazilian state (then-territory) of Acre by Raimundo Irineu Serra, a migrant from Maranhão in Brazil's northeast region.\n\nIrineu Serra was born in Brazil in 1892 to African parents and migrated to the Western Amazon region in 1912, attracted to a boom in the rubber tapping industry. He first drank ayahuasca in the border region between Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru. As a result of experiencing a series of visions whilst spending eight days in solitude in the forest, he began to conduct spiritual ceremonies using ayahuasca. Many people came to him sick, seeking healing they could not afford or failed to find in standard medical practice.\n\nOriginally, Santo Daime teachings had no basis in written text, as early practitioners were illiterate, learning being experiential, through singing of inspired hymns exploring the perennial values of love, harmony and strength through poetic and metaphorical imagery. The hymn collections of early practitioners have since become the sacred works of the doctrine.\n\nDevotional in context, the songs praise divine principles. The Cross of Caravacca (named after the eponymous town, Caravaca), with its double horizontal beam, stands on the altar. Each session begins and ends with Christian prayers. Santo Daime practice features several kinds of rituals. Two of these are \"concentrações\" (\"concentrations\") and \"bailados\" (\"dances\"), also known as \"hinários\" (\"hymnals\"). Other rituals focus on the saying of the rosary or on healing. Participants drink Daime in all types of rituals; but the format and focus will differ; concentrations are silent, seated meditations, while hymnals involve dancing and singing hymns while playing maracas.\n\nThe Christian core is combined with other elements, such as an emphasis on personal gnosis and responsibility, an animist appreciation of nature, such as the Sun, Moon and Stars, as well as the totemic symbol of the \"beija-flor\" (hummingbird). Spiritual beings from indigenous Amazonian shamanism and deities from the African pantheon such as Ogum and Iemanjá are also incorporated into the doctrine. The nature of the work is sometimes personified and addressed as \"Juramidam\", a name disclosed to Irineu in his visionary experience, which means literally, \"God (jura) and his soldiers (midam)\".\n\nAyahuasca, consumed by Daimistas in ceremonies, has many different traditional names, but is known within the Santo Daime as Santo Daime, meaning Holy Daime, or simply, Daime, as originally named by Irineu. \"Dai-me\" (with a hyphen) means \"give me\" in Portuguese. A phrase, \"Dai-me força, dai-me amor\" (\"give me strength, give me love\"), recurs in the doctrine's hymns.\n\nParticipants in the ritual come to submit themselves to a process through which they may learn. This may include various wonders — ayahuasca is known for the visions it generates, and the sense of communion with nature and spiritual reality — as well as more mundane, less pleasant lessons about the self. The Daime is thought to reveal both positive and various negative or unresolved aspects of the individual, resulting in difficult \"passages\" involving the integration of this dissociated psychological content.\n\nCeremonies are referred to as \"works\". The effects of Daime combined with dancing, singing and concentration for up to twelve hours require and develop stamina or \"firmeza\" (firmness).\n\nThe teachings of Santo Daime are transmitted through its hymns which, when sung, are intended to facilitate first hand experience of the divine. Musical accompaniment often includes the unison rhythmic playing of maracas, in strict 4:4, 3:4 or 4:6 time, along with typical folk instruments such as guitars, accordion or flute. Irineu's hymn book contains 129 songs, and chronicles his spiritual journey and evolution from when he began drinking the Daime until his death. Through the singing of his hymns, the participant may connect with the spirit, teachings, and experience of Irineu and, in many ways, begin walking the same spiritual path.\n\nThe singing of the hinarios of early and senior members of the church coincides with official dates on the Santo Daime calendar. A significant proportion of members of the Santo Daime community also make collections of unique songs that they experience internally in connection with their practise. The process of experiencing such new songs in this context is referred to as \"receiving\".\n\nThe death of Mestre Irineu in 1971 resulted in a diversification within the Santo Daime community. From a global perspective, the most significant of these occurred when Sebastião Mota de Melo, commonly called Padrinho Sebastião (\"Godfather Sebastião\"), left the original center with a group of his followers, and formed a distinct group known as CEFLURIS (now called ICEFLU). Many of Padrinho Sebastião's followers were Brazilians from the country's affluent south or citizens of other South American countries who were interested in Daime because of their experience with middle-class counterculture.\n\nAccording to church documents, this split also entailed disagreement over the use of cannabis. Followers of Sebastião Mota de Melo believed cannabis to be a healing plant teacher, and referred to it as Santa Maria, using it in ceremony to help their mediumship (embodying of spirits for the purpose of healing). Subsequently, CEFLURIS formally addressed the issue of the ceremonial use of cannabis, and its use is now officially prohibited in and around the spiritual works. Followers of Mestre Irineu's original church have always regarded the use of cannabis, as well as mediumship generally, as outside the doctrine. Some churches in northern Brazil who denounce cannabis will still sing some hymns of Padrinho Sebastião, but only the ones he received before ever using cannabis.\n\nIn the early 1980s Padrinho Sebastião moved the church headquarters to the village of Céu do Mapiá, in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. Control of CEFLURIS was increasingly shared with its members who joined the movement in the 1970s, and in the 1980s CEFLURIS established centers in southern Brazil. The group now has affiliates in North America, Europe, and Japan, as well as throughout Brazil.\n\nAyahuasca, which contains the psychoactive compound dimethyltryptamine (DMT), has been the subject of increasing legal scrutiny in the last few decades as Santo Daime has expanded. The decoction has been explicitly legal for religious use in Brazil since 1986, while recent legal battles in Europe have legalized its use in the Netherlands and Spain. In the United States, the Supreme Court in 2006 upheld a preliminary injunction permitting another Brazilian church, the União do Vegetal (UDV), to use ayahuasca ritually. This decision, as the result of specific litigation involving the UDV, applies only to that group, so the legal status of ayahuasca generally remains in a gray area in that country.\n\nSanto Daime's entheogenic sacrament, ayahuasca, has been used for millennia in South American indigenous cultures. It is one of the traditional tools of the shaman in South America, and in many regions is to this day a common medicine used for finding and treating various ailments as well as for its vision-inducing effects, which are said to be profound and life-changing.\n\nThe tea has had many names including Santo Daime (or simply Daime), Hoasca, Ayahuasca, Yage, and Caapi. It is made from two or more plants, one a woody vine (Ayahuasca vine or Jagube; generally \"Banisteriopsis caapi\"), and the others known as admixtures. While various plants are used throughout South America, most of which have high concentrations of dimethyltryptamine, the preferred admixture in the case of Santo Daime is \"Psychotria viridis\", known to church members as the \"Queen of the Forest,\" after the figure who is said to have appeared to the church's founder in a vision, prompting him to start the religion. DMT occurs naturally in the human body and is speculated to be released at the time of death, but it is normally digested in the stomach if consumed and an MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor), in this case tetrahydroharmine, harmine and harmaline, is needed to allow it to reach the brain in this way, thus the use of the vine. The Santo Daime Church uses only the Jagube vine and the Viridis leaf, not adding any other plants to the mixture. The tea is prepared ceremoniously over a week by members of the church in a festival called a 'feitio'. Hymns are sung, and Daime is drunk while the men hammer the vine into powder and the women clean and sort the leaves. Because of the very specific manner in which they prepare their sacrament, and the very specific way in which they use it, the beverage is not called 'Ayahuasca', but 'Santo Daime'. In some communities there are very clear distinctions.\n\nDue to their usage of ayahuasca as a sacrament and the spread of the religion, Santo Daime has found itself at the center of Court battles and legal wrangling in various countries.\n\nIn Brazil, CONFEN (the Federal Drug Council) has consistently upheld the right of the Daime Church to practice its religion and healing practices using the Daime. A study was made of the Daime by the CONFEN in 1987 which included visits to the various churches and observation of the making of the Daime. It also included study of another group of ayahuasca users, who call the drink \"vegetal\" (União do Vegetal - UDV). The work group which made the study included representatives not only of the CONFEN but also of several other government agencies. The conclusion of the study was that the Daime was a very positive influence in the community, encouraging social harmony and personal integration. The study noted that, rather than simply considering the pharmacological analysis of the plants, it was essential to consider the whole context of the use of the tea—religious, social, and cultural.\n\nIn the United States, court battles over ritual use of ayahuasca have mostly been fought by the UDV, and practitioners of the Santo Daime doctrine are watching these events closely. So far, UDV has been able to continue practicing legally thanks to Supreme Court decisions that soundly rejected attempts by the government to prohibit it. As of September 2008, UDV is in negotiations with the Drug Enforcement Administration regarding regulation of their use of ayahuasca.\n\nIn September 2008, the three Oregon Santo Daime churches filed suit in federal court to gain legal status. Their trial ended January 23, 2009. The case, \"Church of the Holy Light of the Queen v. Mukasey\", presided over by Judge Owen M. Panner, was ruled in favor of the Santo Daime church.\n\nIn March 2009, Panner found that the use of hallucinogenic tea by members of such churches was legal, issuing an injunction barring the government from penalizing them for its consumption.\n\nIn June 2017 the Santo Daime Church Céu do Montréal received religious exemption to use Ayahuasca as a sacrament in their rituals.\n\nCéu de Toronto also received religious exemption to use Ayahuasca as a sacrament in their rituals.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Santo Daime won a court case in 2001 which allowed them to continue their ceremonial usage of ayahuasca. One factor in this decision was a fax from the Secretary of the International Narcotics Control Board to the Netherlands Ministry of Public Health, stating that \"[P]reparations (e.g. decoctions) made of these plants, including ayahuasca are not under international control and, therefore, not subject to any of the articles of the 1971 Convention\".\n\nIn France, Santo Daime won a court case allowing them to use the decoction in early 2005; however, they were not allowed an exception for religious purposes, but rather for the simple reason that they did not perform chemical extractions to end up with pure DMT and harmala and the plants used were not scheduled. Four months after the court victory, the common ingredients of ayahuasca as well as harmala were declared \"stupéfiants\", or narcotic scheduled substances, making the Daime and its ingredients illegal to use or possess.\n\nThe most recent decision came in Italy in 2006; an eight-month-long investigation had led to the arrest of 24 Italian Santo Daime members in early 2005, but the May 2006 ruling found that no sufficient evidence had been presented to demonstrate that the church members had broken Italian law.\n\nTwo particularly important research projects are worth highlighting. The first is the official investigation made by the Brazilian government at the end of the 1980s, which resulted in the legalization of the religious use of ayahuasca in Brazil in 1992. The second is 'The Hoasca Project' developed by a collective of international scholars. The Hoasca Project presented important findings regarding the use of ayahuasca as an agent of healing, something it is famous for in its indigenous context.\n\nAnother longitudinal research using a control group, but also controlling for rural vs. urban area, was conducted by a team of Spanish researchers and looked at church members that have used ayahuasca for 15 years and at least 2 times per month. The study was led by José Carlos Bouso and funded by MAPS. The study \"found no evidence of psychological maladjustment, mental health deterioration or cognitive impairment in the ayahuasca-using group.\" \n\n"}

Rosales was created as a separate municipality through a Royal Decree in 1852. It was named in honor of Don Antonio Rosales.\n\nPhilippine National Author and internationally renowned novelist Francisco Sionil Josè has set a monument to the town he grew up in with his five-novels-series \"The Rosales Saga\". The town itself is dotted with ancestral houses and heritage structures deemed as important cultural sites via the National Cultural Heritage Act.\n\nRosales is a junction town for those travelling between the provinces of Tarlac and Nueva Ecija to the other towns of Pangasinan. It is accessible via the NLEX (North Luzon Expressway) and TPLEX (Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway), or via the MacArthur Highway.\n\nIt is widely believed that the name Rosales came from the word \"rosal\" which is a name of a flower that was known to be abundant in the area. However, Spanish records revealed that Rosales was originally a \"ranchera\" founded by a pioneering Filipino named Nicolas Bañez. It was declared a pueblo in 1852. The place was named in honor of Don Antonio Rosales Liberal, a man noted for his rectitude, industry, and learning. He is also an Order of the Royal Audiencia in Manila and a Consejero de Filipinas en el Ministro de Ultramar (Secretary of Foreign Affairs) during that time.\n\nRosales is from Manila and is from the provincial capital, Lingayen.\n\nRosales is politically subdivided into 37 barangays.\nLivelihood and products:\n\nLike other towns in the Philippines, Rosales is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the town's departments in executing the ordinances and improving public services. The vice mayor heads a legislative council (Sangguniang Bayan) consisting of councilors from the barangays or barrios.\n\nThe Presidencia (Town hall) is located in front of the Robert B. Estrella Stadium, Poblacion. In 1924, the construction of the Presidencia building (Municipal Town Hall) was completed and became the seat of the municipal government. The heritage building was renovated in 2004-2007 under the administration of Mayor Ricardo V. Revita with his Revitalize Rosales banner.\n\n\n\nSt. Anthony of Padua Parish Church is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Urdaneta (Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan), at Rosales. Through a decree of the Vicar-General of the Archbishopric Authority of Manila, the Catholic Church was restored on February 15, 1915. A modest shed-like barong-barung was built at the present site of the church. Fr. Nicasio Mabanta was the first Parish Priest.\n\nWithin 3 years, a much sturdier building with GI sheets as roofing and sawali walls was constructed. Father Antonio Salindong was assigned, with longest tenure ever, continued the improvement with construction of concrete wall and facade with the image of St. Anthony. In 1946, a strong tornado tore off the GI sheet roof of the Church. Conrado Estrella, Sr. restored the roof with donations of the residents.\n\nDuring the term of Fr. Primo Garcia (1979-1986), the church was expanded in its east and west wings, the beginning of the construction of the parish center, and fencing of the whole premises. Msgr. Geronimo Marcelino begun the renovations of the Parish Rectory and completed by Fr. Diomedes Laguerta.\n\nThe Grotto, which is located at Station District, is regularly visited by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (for spiritual atonement and guidance) and local and foreign tourists.\n\nA centuries-old unfinished dugout, a big banca (five tons, measuring 8 by 2 by 1.5 meters), was accidentally retrieved in November 2010 by Mayor Ricardo Revita at Barangay Casanicolasan in the Lagasit River, near the Agno River.

It is named after Saint Fabian who was a pontiff and saint of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nAround 1818, San Fabian had a boundary dispute with Mangaldan. The boundary between the two towns was the Angalacan river, which sometimes overflows because of floods. The boundary dispute was settled in 1900, when the mayor of San Fabian agreed to meet the mayor of Mangaldan and the two reached an agreement with a boundary marker being erected at Longos between the towns of San Fabian and Mangaldan. The agreement was signed by Juan Ulanday, Nicolas Rosa, Vicente Padilla, Marcelo Erfe, and approved by the American Commander Capt. Ferguson.\n\nDuring the Philippine–American War, hundreds of Pangasinense soldiers and soldiers of the Philippine government died in San Fabian battling the Americans. After the pacification of Pangasinan by the United States, the first town President of San Fabian was Ińigo Dispo. In 1903, the town of Alava became a part of San Fabian and became a mere village or barrio.\n\nDuring World War II, the liberation of US Naval and Marine forces in Pangasinan started when troops under Gen. Walter Krueger landed on Lingayen, Mangaldan and San Fabian beaches. San Fabian landing zones were called White and Blue beaches, names which continue until the present time.\n\nIn October 2009, San Fabian was among the places heavily affected by the floods caused by the release of water by the San Roque Dam at Rosales during the height of the Typhoon Pepeng.\n\nOn October 13, 2012, the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP)-Pangasinan Chapter initiated a tree-planting activity, “broadcastreeing” which covered 10 barangays (Alacan, Cayanga, Guilig, Longos, Mabilao, Poblacion, Rabon, Tempra, Tiblong and Tocok). The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE-1) released P495,000 as livelihood assistance to 30 farmers of the San Fabian Dairy Association.\n\nThe present mayor of San Fabian is Mayor Constante Batrina Agbayani. Current Vice Mayor is Marinor B. De Guzman, the first and only female to be elected as Vice Mayor. Former Vice Mayor Dr. Leopoldo N.

It belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan.\n\nCoastal San Fabián in northern Pangasinán is bounded by the Añgalacán River, Cayañga with neighbors Santo Tomás (La Unión), Sison, Pozorrubio, San Jacinto, Mañgaldán, all of Pangasinan and the Lingayen Gulf. San Fabián was barangay Anguio (\"anguio\" means \"a tree of most bitter fruit\").\n\nThe January 9, 1716 Petition of the Provincial of the Dominican Fathers to the Royal government for the fouSan Fabián \"to stave off the assaults of the pagan Igorots.\" was granted on March 21, 1717 by acting Governor General José Torralba and Governor, Fernando Bustamante on August.\nIn 1718, San Fabián became a vicariate (or parish) under Fr. Andrés Caballero (1718-1720) succeeded by Vicar, Fr. Manuel del Río (1720-1721, 1729-1732), Provincial of the Dominican Order and later, Nueva Segovia Bishop.\n\nAfter the British invasion (1762-1765), Fr. Valentín Marín, O.P. described the new San Fabian Church: \"The church, all of brick, including the main altar was built by Fray Francisco Ferrer, a Dominican lay brother, who was an excellent carpenter, after the British invasion. The convent and belfry were also of brick.\" Fr. Raymundo Suárez, O.P. stated that \"the construction of the imposing bell tower of the church in Lingayén\". Fr. Manuel Mora, OP Secretary of the Provincial in 1804, reported on that the convent had a brick building for Bishop Bernardo Ustáriz which served as \"casa de comunidad\".\n\nFr. Suárez stated the reason of the 1856 burning of the church and the convent: \"For this the sacristan was held responsible because, having gone up to the tower to ring the bell for the curfew at 10 o'clock in the evening, he carelessly threw the cigarette-end on the nipa roofing which, as a result, caught fire at once.\" The church walls were built with those colonial architecture. Fr. Juan Gutiérrez (1859-1862) rebuilt the church and the sanctuary (1857 and 1860) in cruciform (59.85 meters long and 11.40 meters wide; at the cruciform, 20 meters).\n\nIn 1863, Mañgaldán parish priest, Fr. Ramón Fernández (1863-1866) repaired the convent was repaired. The massive earthquake of March 16, 1892 damaged on the church and convent which was later rehabilitated.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town of Santa Barbara lies on a plain terrain in the northern part of the Agno Valley, at the center of Pangasinan. It is just west of the business center of Urdaneta City, with centuries-old mango trees lining the national highway to Santa Barbara. Fifteen kilometers further west is Dagupan City along the Lingayen Gulf, and to its south is the town of Malasiqui and beyond it the City of San Carlos.\n\nSanta Barbara is politically subdivided into 29 barangays.\n\nElected officials 2016–2019:\n\nAlthough a large part of Santa Barbara is fast getting urbanized, the main economic activity remains farming. Rice remains its main crop with 6,662 hectares or close to all its total tillable lands devoted to rice farming. The second most important crop is mango of which the town is famous as the home of age-old Philippine mango seedling nurseries, a veritable home industry in town.\n\nRice and mango are the only crops that are raised in all its 29 barangays. The third most important crop are a variety of vegetables followed by corn. Legumes and root crops are grown in small quantities.\n\nTheir livestock include cattle, carabao, hogs, goats and dogs. They likewise raise native chickens for their food and some poultry farms commercially produce chicken layers and broilers.\n\nOut of the farm produce, Santa Barbara has developed its own food processing industry that includes the making of rice cakes like latik and suman, nata-de coco making, and pickles from different fruits.\n\nIt likewise has a highly developed clay tiles and pottery industry coupled with non-farm based processing industries like candle and soap making and the making of hollow blocks for construction. The town has one industrial plant, the Ginebra San Miguel gin manufacturing plant in Tebag West barangay along the national highway towards Dagupan.\n\nThe town’s business and trading center in and around the public market features a variety of wholesale and retail and other services establishments from farm inputs to construction materials. The market serves as the place where its people buy their needs and sell their produce. Transportation between the commercial center and the many barangays is served by a large fleet of individually owned tricycles.\n\nSanta Barbara’s close proximity to Urdaneta City, has, however, constrained the growth of its trading sector.\n\nSanta Barbara is populated mainly by Pangasinans with a sprinkling of other ethnic groups led by the Ilocanos.\n\nIt is largely a suburban community with much of its population densely concentrated in 29 barangays. By the year 2016, the town’s population was projected to have reached 86,269, with a growth rate of 3.75 percent per year for the past seven years, faster than the national average.\n\nMore than half of the families or roughly 60 percent are farmers who till the northern part of the rich Agno Valley. Average family income as of the 2000 national census, was a low P9,662.67 a year. Maybe because the average farming family does not buy, but produce the bulk of its own food, family expenditures were lower at P7,545.42. The average Santa Barbaran family has a disposable income of over P2,000 a year despite statistical data that had shown that a family In the Ilocos region needed PhP 14,749.00 in income a year to survive.\n\nA high level of self-sufficiency in food is likewise gleaned in the town’s minimal rate of malnutrition of only .50 percent severely malnourished out of 5.12 percent malnourished -pre-school children. The public school system is also proud of having an unusually low drop-out rate in the elementary grades and high school.\n\nPoverty rate in Santa Barbara is high as average income is even lower than the regional poverty threshold. But food self-sufficiency has saved its town folks from sliding to the ranks of the very poor.\n\nThe heritage Santa Barbara Parish of the Holy Family Church, built in 1716, is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan, Vicariate III. Rev. Fr. Fidelis B. Layog is its Parish Priest and Rev. Fr. Jim Cerezo is its Parish Vicar.\n\nAlso owing to its suburban location and easy access to three nearby cities, Urdaneta, San Carlos and Dagupan, Santa Barbara has attracted subdivision developers, both for middle-class and low-cost markets. As of mid-2008, it has attracted to its territory eight different housing projects including subdivisions developed by the company owned by Senate President Manny Villar and a pilot Gawad Kalinga housing project for the very poor embarked by the town government and its private sector partners.\n\nThe town has a total of 137.509 linear kilometers of road network classified into national, provincial, municipal and barangay roads. All the national highways passing through town and those under the town government have been paved. The 17 kilometers of provincial roads are about three fourths paved while more than half (67.10%) of 92.5 kilometers of barangay roads otherwise known as farm to market roads, needed concreting.\n\nUnlike paved roads, electricity has reached all of the town’s 29 barangays with about 80 percent of all households served. Power rates are much lower than in Metro Manila for both households, commercial and industrial users.\n\nTwo of the biggest landline telephone companies, PLDT and Digitel, plus one wireless company, Smart, serves the communication needs of the town although units to users ratio as of 2007 was still low at one phone for every 93 residents.\n\nThe local government-run Rural Health Unit and its 10 satellite barangay health centers, plus seven private medical clinics and one dental clinic serve the basic health needs of Santa Barbara residents.\n\nSanta Barbara has an extensive public elementary and high school system. It has a total of 26 elementary schools supervised by two school districts plus seven public high schools. These are manned by 418 teachers and other school personnel with a student of over 15,000 children in any given year.\n\nTheir healthy teacher to pupil ratio averaging one to 34 in the elementary grades and one is to 41 in high school and their minimal drop-out rates of two percent in the elementary grades and less than four in every 100 students that enter high school.\nThis was the state of things in Santa Barbara when the local leadership changed in mid-2007.\n\n"}

From this date, to the present, the different successions of presidents, alcaldes and mayors had occurred all over the islands.\n\nFor many years, during the Spanish Regime, religion was the basis of educating the masses. From time to time missionaries of different orders were sent out to Santa Maria to carry out religious services as required of them. It was during the routine visit of a certain priest from the town of Asingan, which was then the most eastern town of the province of Pangasinan, who had extended his mission farther into the east and came to a village. The village was located on a plain in which the Agno River ran and which with a little effort could be irrigated. The missionary believed that the village could be developed into a prosperous community. Finding the residents to be hospitable, he chatted with them and, in the course of conversation, he thought of giving the place a name. Since it was the Virgin Mary's Day, he called the people of the village to him and with a simple but impressive solemnity proclaimed this place as Santa Maria on this, the Virgin Mary's day.\n\nIn the course of time prominent people improved the locality and transferred the town site from Namagbagan, which is now a barrio of the municipality, to its present site near a clay promontory where it formed an impregnable defense against the yearly erosion of the Agno, thus annexing \"De Pila\" to the original name and making Santa Maria de Pila its final name, a name which is known beyond the confines of the province of Pangasinan.\n\nThe town much progressive due to close proximity to Rosales and Tayug.\n\n"}

He died in Rome on 9 January 1889, aged 79.\n\nAmong his publications are \"No Union with Rome\" (1871); \"The Priest in Absolution\" (1877); \"My Recollections of the Last Four Popes, etc.\", in answer to Cardinal Wiseman\" (1858); \"Orations, 2 decades\" (1851).\n\nIn the spring of 1853, Gavazzi visited North America. Gavazzi Riots were disturbances created in Quebec on 6 June 1853, and in Montreal, on 9 June, by mobs which attacked halls in which Gavazzi was lecturing. His lectures at Quebec and Montreal were strongly anti-Roman Catholic; and at both places the soldiers had to be called out to restore order. At Montreal, 40 lives were lost. The riots also caused political repercussions.\n\nOther languages:\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nLocated on the Lingayen Gulf on the northwest-central part of the island of Luzon, Dagupan is a major commercial and financial center north of Manila. Also, the city is one of the centers of modern medical services, media and communication in North-Central Luzon. The city is situated within the fertile Agno River Valley.\n\nThe city is among the top producers of milkfish (locally known as \"bangus\") in the province. From 2001–2003, Dagupan's milkfish production totaled to 35,560.1 metric tons (MT), contributing 16.8 percent to the total provincial production. Of its total production in the past three years, 78.5 percent grew in fish pens/cages while the rest grew in brackish water fishponds.\n\nDagupan is administratively and politically independent from the provincial government of Pangasinan and is only represented by the province's legislative district.\n\nDagupan City is one of the proposed metropolitan area in the Philippines. Metro Dagupan is proposed to include the independent component city of Dagupan, as well as the towns of Lingayen, Binmaley, Calasiao, Mangaldan, Manaoag, Mapandan, San Fabian, San Jacinto, and Santa Barbara.\n\nThe city's name was derived from the local Pangasinan word \"pandaragupan\", meaning \"gathering place\" as the city has been a regional market center for centuries.\n\nDuring the 15th century, Pangasinan had been the site of an ancient polity called the Kaboloan. the Wangdom of Pangasinan sent emissaries to China in 1406–1411.\n\nThe area that is now known as Dagupan was described as marshland thickly covered with mangrove and nipa palm trees. The natives lived along the shoreline and riverbanks of Calmay, Pantal, and Bonuan. But there were also communities in Malued, Lasip, Pogo, and Bacayao. The natives called the area \"Bacnotan\" which would later be incorporated into the \"encomienda\" of Lingayen that was established in 1583.\n\nThe first long distance railroad in the Philippines connecting Manila and Dagupan was opened on November 24, 1892.\n\nThe Japanese planes bombed in Dagupan in December 1941; Dagupan was occupied by Japanese forces starting in 1942.\n\nOn January 8–January 9, 1945, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur landed his amphibious liberation force in the city's \"Blue Beach\" section along the Lingayen Gulf. From his beachhead in Dagupan, along with those in neighboring towns Lingayen, Binmaley and San Fabian, MacArthur's forces under General Walter Krueger together with the Philippine Commonwealth troops under the Philippine Army and Philippine Constabulary units were able to penetrate Japanese defenses in Luzon island and liberate Filipino and allied prisoners of war near Cabanatuan in the province of Nueva Ecija, and in Manila's University of Santo Tomas, among others.\n\nDagupan became a city by virtue of \"Republic Act No. 170\", authored by Speaker Eugenio Pérez. It was signed into law by President Manuel Roxas on June 20, 1947.\n\nThe westward expansion of the city went as far as Lucao, which was also swampland. Local historian Restituto Basa surmised that the name \"Lucao\" may have been derived from the shellfish called \"lukan\" that used to abound in the swampy area. \n\nIn June 1962, Dagupan was shaken by a series of strong earthquakes which occurred at irregular intervals for about three weeks. The quakes toppled the belfry of the Roman Catholic Church. Many people from Calmay, Carael and island barrios evacuated to other towns. \n\nIn 1968, the national government agencies opened offices in Dagupan and other key cities across the country. The daytime population increased substantially, causing congestion in the city that began to see the appearance of public utility tricycles. \n\nOn July 16, 1990, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck northern Luzon, causing liquefaction, which made buildings tilt and sink due to their heavy weight and the looseness of the ground, which turned into sediment-rich mud. The Magsaysay Bridge, one of the two bridges especially spanning the Pantal River, collapsed, delaying people from crossing to the other banks and vice versa. Major damage caused businesses to be permanently transferred to the neighbouring towns of Mangaldan and Calasiao, but somehow, Dagupan and its inhabitants managed to recover from the earthquake.\n\nDagupan City covers a total land area of , bounded by the Lingayen Gulf in the north, San Fabian in the northeast, Mangaldan in the east, Calasiao in the south and Binmaley in the west. Land use is primarily for agriculture with 35.98% of the total land area, fishpond, cropland, residential with 22.88%; others uses are commercial, industrial, institutional, government private, parks and roads.\n\nDagupan City is politically subdivided into 31 barangays.\n\nDagupan City has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification: \"Am\").\nIn Dagupan, the Pangasinans are the predominant people and the Pangasinan language is predominantly used in the city and environs, followed by English and Filipino, as well as Ilocano. Chinese is mainly spoken only by a few city individuals of Chinese descent.\n\nDagupan is connected with other cities by networks of national roads. Romulo Highway and Pangasinan - La Union Road (N55) and Urdaneta - Dagupan Road (N56) are the principal highways that serve the city.\n\nThe Philippine National Railways (PNR) once served Dagupan through Dagupan station, that went defunct in the late 1980s. The first railroad in the Philippines, the Manila-Dagupan Railway, terminated at the city.\n\nIntercity/interprovincial buses from Manila serve the city, and are usually operated by Dagupan Bus Company, Victory Liner, Five Star, and Pangasinan Solid North. Jeepneys provide intracity travel, as well as for towns and cities of close proximities.\n\nDagupan is the economic center of Pangasinan and the rest of North-Central Luzon. As a hub, many people in Pangasinan commute to the city during the day. This causes the city's daytime population to rise and cause traffic to parts of the city, especially the downtown area. The city is a vital financial center housing numerous banks, non-bank financial institutions and offices of some of the government agencies.\n\nHistorically, Dagupan was a center for salt making in numerous salt evaporator beds in the low-lying swampy areas close to the Lingayen Gulf, Beginning in the 19th Century, some of the salt making operations gave way to pond culture of fish, most prominently the milkfish or as it is known locally ad \"bangus\" for which the city has become famous. Fisheries, aquaculture and processed fisheries products are an important mainstay of the city's economy.\n\nManila based developers have also set shop in this bustling city due to its strategic location and growing population.\n\n▪ Santa Lucia Land Inc. (Almeria Verde Subdivision)\n\n▪ Double Dragon Properties (CityMall Mayombo)\n\n▪ SM Prime Holdings (SM Center Dagupan [u/c], planned SM Savemore Dagupan, and planned SM City Dagupan)\n\n▪ 11 story Allied Care Experts Medical Center\n\n▪ Green Sun Management Inc. & Megaworld Construction and Development Corporation (5 story Green Sun Hotel)\n\n▪ Filinvest (Fora Dagupan - a 6.3 hectare Townscape development)\n\nLocal businessmen have also went with the trend in developing their properties in different locations which further boosts the city's construction activities and secures the city's title as the economic hub of Pangasinan.\n\nAnother part of Dagupan's economy is the motor vehicle industry. Many automotive companies have a dealership in the city's metropolitan area. Existing car dealerships from major companies including Ford, Hyundai, Chevrolet, Mazda and Izuzu are all found in Dagupan, while other companies such as Toyota, Honda, Mitsubishi, Nissan and many more are found at the neighbouring town of Calasiao.\n\nSince the colonial era, Dagupan has always been the center of education in Ilocos Region (Region 1). The private sector-driven centers of education University of Pangasinan, University of Luzon and Lyceum-Northwestern University lead, 14 colleges and 18 vocational schools and 3 technical learning centers, 19 secondary schools and 53 elementary schools both in public and private.\n\n\nMedical and health service centers abound in Dagupan. Out of 51 hospitals in Pangasinan, 12 are located in the city. The largest of these is the Region 1 Medical Center with hospital bed capacity of 600.\n\nDagupan City is home to regional television stations of GMA Network, CNN Philippines, TV5, IBC 13 and ABS-CBN, sixteen radio broadcasting stations, at least seventeen local newspapers and three cable television companies. There are two news programs TV Patrol North Luzon (ABS-CBN TV-32 Dagupan) and Balitang Amianan (GMA Dagupan).\n\n\n\n"}

Since 1973, they constitute the national armed forces of Guinea-Bissau. A separate Cape Verdean branch of the FARP constituted the national armed forces of this country from 1975 until the early 1990s, when these were renamed \"Cape Verdean Armed Forces\".\n\nIn the process of the preparation of the armed struggle against the Portuguese rule over the then Portuguese Guinea, in 1962, the PAIGC established a Military Action and Organization Plan which defined the general scheme of a military structure. This plan foresaw two types of armed guerrilla groups: area or territorial groups and mobile or intervention groups. In the end of that year, these groups were already armed with hand grenades and PPSh-41 submachine-guns.\n\nThe armed struggle finally started on 23 January 1963, with a guerrilla attack against the Portuguese garrison in Tite.\n\nIn the I Congress of the PAIGC of 1963, a decision was taken to created the People's Army (\"Exército Popular\") and the People's Militia (responsible for the guarding of the liberated areas), as well to restructure the Guerrilla. This was to be done from the already existing units, staffed with personnel recently trained in China.\n\nIn fulfillment of the decision taken in the I Congress, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of the People (FARP) were created in February 1964, being constituted by the then also created People's Army and by the already existent Guerrilla. The People's Militia was also created at that time, but was not part of the FARP, being instead dependent from the civil political and administrative bodies of the PAIGC.\n\nThe main tactical unit of the FARP became the infantry bi-group (\"bigrupo\"), each being constituted by two or more infantry groups, headed by a commander and a political commissar and supported by heavy weapons. Each infantry group included around 18 elements armed with automatic weapons, three machine-guns and two rocket-propelled grenades. The structure of the bi-group was so well adapted to this type of warfare that some of the Portuguese units copied its organization, with General Spínola defending the general reorganization of all the Portuguese \"caçadores\" (light infantry) companies accordingly with its model. Besides the bi-groups, the FARP also included independent specialized groups of sharpshooters, heavy mortars, rockets, rocket-propelled grenades, sappers, anti-tank guns and antiaircraft artillery, as well as artillery batteries.\n\nIn 1971, the PAIGC proceeded to a deep restructuring of the FARP. These came to be constituted by the Nationalist Armed Forces (\"Forças Armadas Nacionalistas\") or FAN and by the Local Armed Forces (\"Forças Armadas Locais\") or FAL. The FAN included the already existing National People's Army (former People's Army) and the newly created National People's Navy. The bi-groups, independent groups and artillery batteries of the National People's Army were grouped in army corps and these were grouped in armies. The National People's Navy included both naval units as well as Marines (\"fuzileiros\") units. The FAL were the former People's Militia, now being also integrated in the FARP.\n\nPAIGC unilaterally declared the independence of Guinea-Bissau on 24 September 1973, which was recognized by a number of countries. The FARP came so to be considered the national armed forces of the new state. The armed struggle continued however, as Portugal obviously did not recognize this independence, with its forces remaining in which it still considered as its province of Guinea. Finally, following the change of political regime caused by the Carnation Revolution, Portugal recognized the independence of Guinea-Bissau in 10 September 1974, withdrawing its military forces from the new country.\n\nWhen Cape Verde become independent in 1975, its newly created armed forces became also known as FARP, being constituted originally with some Cape Verdean elements that participated in the struggle in Guinea-Bissau. At this time, there were still plans to unite Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, with the two countries being ruled by PAIGC. This plan of unification was however abandoned, with the military of Cape Verde being renamed \"Cape Verdean Armed Forces\" in the early 1990s.\n\nPresently, the FARP continue to be the armed forces of Guinea-Bissau.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2069203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069203", "title": "Plan 1919", "text": "Plan 1919\n\nPlan 1919 was a military strategy drawn up by J.F.C. Fuller in 1918 during World War I. His plan criticised the practice of physically destroying the enemy, and instead called for tanks to rapidly advance into the enemy's rear area to destroy supply bases and lines of communication, which would also be bombed. He suggested a lightning thrust toward the command center of the German Army:\n\nThe Allied advance and German retreat across France and Belgium in 1918 had begun to show some of the pace and aspects that would mark later mechanized warfare; British tanks played an increasing role, and German rear-guard defenses focused on stopping their advance. Although never implemented, Plan 1919 would have carried these trends forward earlier.\n\nBy 1918, the German, French and British armies had been through years of trench warfare and were getting close to the breaking point. Both sides realized that a new form of warfare was needed for the successful conclusion of the war. Tanks, although used unsuccessfully at the Battles of the Somme and Passchendaele, were used in the Battle of Cambrai and demonstrated their usefulness. Although the main objective was not achieved and the German artillery made short work of them after the initial shock wore off, they inspired military theorists to try to incorporate them properly. \nIn the spring of 1918, J.F.C. Fuller submitted a study titled \"The tactics of the attack as affected by the speed and circuit of the Medium D tank\", a bold new plan involving tanks and air support that aimed to target the German leadership and supply lines, as opposed to the then current tactic of grinding away at the main forces.\n\nFuller's plan had three elements. The first was a fast attack by medium tanks and aircraft against the German headquarters, removing its ability to control their forces. Then the main assault by heavy tanks, infantry and artillery would break the German lines. Finally cavalry, light tanks and infantry mounted on trucks would follow the retreating Germans preventing them from reforming or counterattacking.\n\nHis plan was to be used as the blueprint for the spring offensive the next year and was titled Plan 1919. The German surrender that November precluded the implementation of the plan, but it was studied extensively by the Germans and used as the model for their Blitzkrieg attacks during the next war (Fuller). Plan 1919, although never carried out, laid the “groundwork” for numerous upgrades in military equipment, technology, and tactics of modern warfare .\n\nFuller's ideas were largely in line with papers put forward by other members of the Tank Corps such as by Capper and Elles' paper \"The future of tank operations and production requirements\" which envisaged tank forces of several thousand light, medium and heavy tanks and the means and time it would take to produce them and deploy them to the front.\n\nFuller, in his \"Military History of the Western World\" states, \"There are two ways of destroying an organization: 1. by wearing it down, 2. by rendering it inoperative. In war the first comprises the killing, wounding, capturing and disarming of the enemy's soldiers- body warfare. The second, the rendering inoperative of his power of command- brain warfare. To take a single man as an example: the first method may be compared to a succession of slight wounds which will eventually cause him to bleed to death; the second- a shot through the brain.\"\n\nTo accomplish this \"shot through the brain\" Fuller's plan required generals to penetrate the enemy's defenses using tanks and targeting his chain of supply; so that in the ensuing confusion the enemy leadership could then be eliminated decisively. The goal of this was “the destruction of the enemy’s policy” (Reid) . This would be accomplished by armored units penetrating the enemy lines and causing havoc in the rear areas, with the ultimate aim of eliminating the enemy leadership. The Plan emphasized the intended use of aircraft in the support role, along with motorized infantry to conduct operations in terrain unsuited to tanks. This mobile form of operations utilizing tanks and aircraft was a huge departure from the established infantry tactics of the day. \n\nDetractors point out the flaws in Fuller's plan. It is a strong point that the tank required by the plan had not been fielded yet, and that war weary Britain could not afford the manpower and materials needed to implement it (Palazzo) , and as was demonstrated at Cambrai, the German artillery was deadly against the current British tanks without accompanying artillery support.\n\nA new 40 ton tank design Mark VIII tank – based on the earlier British heavy tanks – was under construction in late 1918 with an ambitious production scheme of up to 4,500 tanks. Hundreds of these would be used in the spearhead and once these had broken through the German lines, the faster medium tanks would have \"raced through\" to disrupt the enemy rear. Aircraft would have been used to resupply the tanks and keep the breakthrough moving. (Ellis) \n\nThe British had a \"trench fighter\" design in production with orders for 1,400 aircraft. The Sopwith Salamander was armoured so that it could strafe and bomb the enemy trenches and artillery with less risk.\n\nPlan 1919, although never carried out, laid the “groundwork” for upgrades in military equipment, technology, and tactics of modern warfare. The Americans designed a new tank based on the British Medium “D” tank, as described by Fuller in his Plan 1919, to be able to execute the new mobile form of warfare (Hofmann) . The German blitzkrieg style of modern warfare was similar to Fuller's Plan 1919. This style of warfare emphasized the use of armored units and close air support, to make quick attacks designed to penetrate the enemy's front lines and cause confusion (Fuller) . This type of warfare is still used today, as demonstrated by the American forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom, when they first occupied Iraq. \n\nFuller's theory of having the tanks, aircraft, and numerous other warfare tactics prescribed in Plan 1919 was that a mobile battlefield would provide more protection against losses to friendly forces. Fewer soldiers therefore put at risk on the battlefield, implied fewer troops to command, therefore making it easier for the commander to lead troops . More effective battles could then be fought with fewer casualties. Warfare could then become more organized. Superior firepower, and air power would increase the combat effectiveness of attacking command and communication centers .\n\nFuller drew up the plans for Plan 1919 with many beliefs and hopes for the future of armies in Europe and around the world . He believed that Plan 1919 was the groundwork for numerous innovations in the armed forces . The new armies would consist of highly trained and proficient individuals that would be professional in the way they acted and the way they led on the battlefield . Fuller also believed that with time, military technologies would become more advanced and more proficient in their performed operations . This meant that technologies would thus become more deadly and more effective at destroying the enemy, allowing more pinpoint strikes and minimizing collateral damage .\n\nFuller's plan was not the only option on the table for 1919. As Albert Palazzo points out in his paper \"Plan 1919– The Other One\", the chemical warfare planners had big plans for the next year's offensive . He points out they were fielding a new gas called DM, which penetrated the German masks(47) . The technology for this new gas was much closer to fruition than the tank required by Fuller's plan . In addition, Winston Churchill, as Minister of Munitions, had already called for the production of gas agents to be increased by five times the current production(46) .\n\nThe chemical advocates therefore did not have to contend with technology issues. They were utilizing a proven method of warfare. Their plan only called for increasing the extent of chemical warfare. Palazzo also points out they intended to use airplanes as delivery systems for the chemical agents and envisioned the gas being used to target command centres (45).\n\nIn many respects then, the gas advocates plan seems to have offered much the same possibility for success, with little of the implementation difficulties of Fuller's plan. The armistice however made their plans unnecessary also. In history's light however, this plan remains obscure due to the nature of chemical warfare. As Palazzo put it, \"few weapons have inspired such universal revulsion\" (39).\n\n\n"}

The tendency to switch back and forth from Creole to Standard English often seems to correlate with the class status of the speaker. Persons of higher social status tend to switch between Standard English and Creole more readily, due to their more extensive formal education in the English-language school system. Creole usage is more common, and is less similar to Standard English, as speakers descend the socioeconomic ladder. This is an example of a Creole continuum.\n\nMany Creole words are derived from English or African origins. The creole was formed when slaves owned by English planters imitated the English of their enslavers but pronounced it with their own inflections. This can be easily seen in phrases such as \"\", meaning \"I am not going,\" or in \",\" presumably a cognate of \"Ain't it?\"\n\nVocabulary is widely influenced by British vocabulary, due to centuries of association with Great Britain. Examples:\n\n\nHowever, in other cases the American form prevails over the British one, due to the islands' close proximity to the United States:\n\n\nBecause of the influx of other Caribbean nationals to Antigua, due to natural migration and to the CSME, Antigua's everyday vocabulary is being influenced by Jamaican Creole, Bajan Creole, Guyanese Creole and Trinidadian Creole. This is even more common among the youth. Examples:\n\n\n\nAntiguan is pronounced very similarly to Jamaican. This has led some to surmise that the slaves of these countries came from the same place in Africa. Below are a few ways in which some language blends are fused or changed completely.\n\n\nLeeward Caribbean Creole English first emerged during the 18th century as an English-lexifer Creole. While it thus adopted many features of the English language everything from the creole's lexicon to its phonology reflects Antigua's more nuanced history. \n\nThe English arrived in Antigua in 1632 from neighboring St. Kitts upon which the first European establishment was founded on the island. Throughout the seventeenth century there was resistance to the use of slave labor due to the widespread belief that there was merit in laboring for one's self. However, as the island shifted from a subsistence economy to a more commercial one, the demand for laborers took off. This was met with indentured servants hailing primarily from Southern England and Scotland (following the 1707 Act of Union), as well as imported slaves. Around the same time, in 1674, Colonel Christopher Codrington, emigrated from Barbados to Antigua and established the island's first sugar plantation. This marked the beginning of what was to become the pinnacle of the island's economy until the late 18th century. And as the plantation economy grew, so did the desire for cheap labor. This is displayed in the monumental shift in the number of slaves on the island, from 41.6% of the population in 1672 to 90.2% merely 40 years later. Initially, these slaves were imported from the Bights of Benin and Biafra. There, the majority of the population spoke Delto-Benuic languages such as Igbo and Duala. However, in the early 1700s more slaves were imported to Antigua from the Gold Coast than from any other part of Africa. This was short-lived and soon after the Bights of Benin and Biafra overtook the Gold Coast in exportation of slaves to Antigua. \n\nThis is all to say that Leeward Caribbean Creole English, or Antiguan Creole, was conceived against the backdrop of a plethora of different languages and cultures, all of which have influenced this Creole. Words and syntax of Igbo origin like \"eddoes\" the Igbo word for \"taro,\" and their second-person plural \"unu\" are widespread while English lexicon while at the end of the day, it evolved from the English of the island's colonizers in conjunction with substrate languages of West African origin. \n\nAntiguan Creole is used in almost every aspect of life in Antigua. In all schools, during class hours, it is required of students to speak Standard English. This policy is especially exercised in private owned schools. Most media and mainstream communication is written and spoken in Standard English, although Antiguan Creole is sometimes used humorously or as a way of identifying with the local public.\n\nUse of Antiguan Creole varies depending on socio-economic class. In general, the higher and middle classes use it amongst friends and family but switch to Standard English in the public sphere. The lower class tend to use Antiguan Creole in almost every sector of life. Part of this discrepancy dates back to the Creole's inception. Ever since Antiguan Creole first came into existence it was used as a means to identify with a given group. For example, as more slaves entered the island, indentured servants and slaves had less contact with white plantation owners as the economy moved to a larger-scale. While these two groups interacted and a Creole emerged as the two groups had to communicate and interact, indentured servants tried to speak the 'Standard English' with increased frequency in order to associate with people at the top of the hierarchy for whom 'Standard English' was the norm. Conversely, for slaves, speaking the Creole was a symbol of identity. \n\n\nI, me = me;\nyou, you (thou, thee) = yu;\nhe, him = he;\nshe, her = she; \nwe, us = ah-we;\nthey, them = dem;\n\nTo form the possessive form of the pronoun add \"fu-\" to the above.

MR-13 was founded in 1960 by a group of dissident officers. It grew partly out of the popular protests against the government of President Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes following his election in 1958. It was led by Luis Augusto Turcios Lima, Marco Antonio Yon Sosa and Luis Trejo Esquivel. Alejandro de León, co-founder of the group, was captured and shot by the judicial police in 1961. In 1963, MR-13 joined the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR).\n\nMR-13 nominally continued to exist until 1973, after it was severely hampered in the 1966-67 counterinsurgency by the Guatemalan government.\n\nOn 13 November 1960, a group of 120 young military officers joined by approximately 3000 enlisted soldiers seized the Zacapa military base and most of the Eastern Military Zone of the country and demanded the resignation of President Ydígoras. The rebels' discontent was fueled by the staggering corruption of the Ydígoras regime, the government's showing of favoritism in military promotions and in providing other rewards to officers who supported Ydígoras, and what they perceived as incompetence in running the country. The proximate trigger for the November 13 revolt, however, was Ydígoras' decision to allow the United States to train an invasion force in Guatemala to prepare for the planned Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba. Ydígoras had not consulted the Guatemalan military about this decision and did not share with the military the payoff he received in exchange from the US government. The military just watched as unmarked US warplanes piloted by US-based Cuban exiles flew in large numbers over their country. The rebel officers were concerned about the loss of sovereignty for the country as the US established a secret air strip and training camp at Retalhuleu to prepare for its invasion of Cuba. The rebellion was not ideological in its origins.\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) flew B-26 bombers disguised as Guatemalan military jets to bomb the rebel bases because the coup threatened its plans for the invasion of Cuba as well as the Guatemalan regime it supported. The rebels fled to neighboring Honduras and formed the kernel of what became known as MR-13.\n\nIn early 1962 they returned and on 6 February 1962 in Bananera they attacked the offices of the United Fruit Company (present day Chiquita Brands), an American corporation that controlled vast territories in Guatemala as well as in other Central American countries. The attack sparked sympathetic strikes and university student walkouts throughout the country, to which the Ydígoras regime responded with a violent crackdown. This violent crackdown sparked the Guatemalan Civil War.\n\nThe MR-13 later initiated contact with the outlawed PGT (Guatemalan Labour Party; composed and led by middle-class intellectuals and students) and a student organization called the Movimiento 12 de Abril (April 12 Movement) and together with these groups merged into a coalition guerilla organization called the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) in December 1962. Also affiliated with the FAR was the FGEI (Edgar Ibarra Guerrilla Front) led by Luis Augusto Turcios Lima. The MR-13, PGT and the FGEI each operated in different parts of the country as three separate \"frentes\" (fronts); the MR-13 established itself in the mostly ladino departments of Izabal and Zacapa, the FGEI established itself in Sierra de las Minas and the PGT operated as an urban guerrilla front. Each of these three \"frentes\" (comprising no more than 500 combatants) were led by former members of the 1960 army revolt, who had previously been trained in counterinsurgency warfare by the United States.\n\nThe US government supported the Guatemalan junta in the Guatemalan Civil War against MR-13 and other rebel factions as well as the civilians who supported them. A 1968 CIA report stated that: \"With some assistance from Cuba, the small band, under the leadership of Marco Antonio Yon Sosa, engaged in sporadic terrorist acts, including harassment of communications lines, buses, and railroad tracks, pillaging of military supply points and plantations for money and arms, assassination of army collaborators, and attacks on commercial and official installations.\" An estimated 200,000 civilians were killed or \"disappeared\" during the civil war, most at the hands of the military, police and intelligence services of the Guatemalan regime. Victims of the repression included indigenous activists, suspected government opponents, returning refugees, critical academics, students, left-leaning politicians, trade unionists, religious workers, journalists, and street children on a scale that constituted genocide. The \"Comisión para el Esclarecimiento Histórico\" has estimated that 93% of violence in the conflict have been committed by government forces and 3% by the guerrillas.\n\n"}

The municipality is known for its lighthouse and the old stone houses of the Ivatan villages of Chavayan and Savidug. Like Batan Island to the north, Sabtang also has a few Mission-style churches and white sand beaches.\n\nThe Spanish missionary Fr. Artiquez first visited the Island of Sabtang in 1786 after receiving an affirmative response from the island to learn about the Christian faith. The success of the first visit led to two more evangelical trips resulting in the baptism of 181 children and the study of the catechism among the adult natives. The evangelization of Sabtang was cut short due to the failing health of the Spanish missionaries. For this, the inhabitants of Sabtang remained faithful to old traditions especially in the administration of justice by vendetta and murder.\n\nIn 1791, the then most powerful chief in Sabtang named Aman Dangat showed defiance of the government of Governor Joaquin del Castillo by killing the Spanish soldiers who went to Sabtang to procure supplies. Lieutenant Tomas Nuñez led the troops to capture the rebels. Aman Dangat was put to trial and admitted to the crime. He, later on, asked to be baptized. The inhabitants of Sabtang were then forced to resettle in San Vicente and San Felix in Ivana to be better supervised by the government.\n\nSome forty years after the resettlement, the Sabteños were allowed to visit their native island and gradually these visits allowed them to build homes in their erstwhile land. The government allowed this to happen on the condition that houses should be constructed in lowlands. To sustain the spiritual care for the Sabteños, a new mission was opened in Sabtang in 1845 under the patronage of Saint Vincent Ferrer with Fr. Antonio Vicente as its first vicar. Fr.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThousands of years before Spanish colonization, about a thousand people lived on fortified cliffs and hilltops scattered across today's Uyugan. The fortified settlements were called \"\"Idiang\"\" and derived from the Ivatan word \"\"Idi\"\" or \"\"Idian\"\" which means home or hometown. They belonged to the Ivatan tribes and spoke the same Ivatan language, but with a southern accent.\n\nThe Ivatan tribes who called the place home farmed, where soil permitted, and they fished. They were also a boat-making and seafaring people, and they traded with neighbouring Taiwan to the North and Cagayan to the South.\n\nThe Ivatan tribal settlements had a \"de facto\" tribal government, not very much different from that of tribal governments in the earlier stages of human evolution. The tribal settlement was headed by a chieftain with a deputy.\n\nInter-tribal hostilities (\"Arap du Tukon\") or \"War on the Hill\" were common in those days but for men only. Common law prohibited the harming of womenfolk who were the main providers of food in wartime.\n\nIn the late 1600s, Dominican missionaries landed in Batanes. The native people were in the beginning not all that welcoming to the early Spanish colonizers, but slowly they were able to adopt themselves to the Spanish ways. The Spaniards had very different lifestyles, beliefs, and traditions than the Ivatan tribes. They didn't understand the native peoples' social customs, generous nature, religious beliefs, or love of the land.\n\nAccording to church records, the first mass and baptism in the islands was celebrated in what is now Imnajbu in Uyugan.\n\nThe Spanish missionaries, finding the conditions harsh in Batanes, there were attempts to resettle the Ivatans in Cagayan, but they always found their way home - they sailed back to Batanes.\n\nIn 1782, Spanish Governor-General Jose Basco y Vargas sent an expedition to formally get the consent of the Ivatans to become subjects of the King of Spain.\n\nOn June 26, 1783, de facto Ivatan independence was lost - a sad day to many Ivatans, but equally, a new beginning and a day of celebration to many other Ivatans. On that day (it's called \"Batanes Day\" today) the Spanish representatives of the King of Spain met the representatives of the chiefs and nobles of Batanes on the Plains of Vasay (in what is now Basco town) for the ceremonial formal annexation of Batanes to the Spanish Empire.\n\nThe new province was named \"Provincia de la Conception\". Governor-General Jose Basco y Vargas was named \"Conde de la Conquista de Batanes\" and the capital town of Basco was named after him. The Dominican Order established missions, among them the San Jose de Ivana mission which included all of present-day Uyugan and Sabtang.\n\nThe Americans followed the Spaniards to Batanes after the Spanish naval defeat at Manila Bay. The dropped anchor at Basco Bay in February 1900. In 1901, the province was reclassified to a township, but provincial status was restored in 1909, and with it the creation of Uyugan as a separate township (municipality).\n\nAmerican public school system was introduced and general health and sanitation campaign was launched. In the 1930s, the Americans built a better road system that replaced the road system (\"El Camino Real\") built during the Spanish period.\n\nUyugan is located at in the south-eastern part of Batan Island, bounded on the north by Mahatao, south by the Balintang Channel, east by the Philippine Sea, and west by Ivana. Uyugan is located at \n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Batanes.\n\nThe Uyugan town proper (\"Centro\" or \"Idi\" to the Isantoninos) is from Basco, the provincial capital. It is located along the banks of what was once a brook, a kilometer east of the Ivana-Uyugan border.\n\nThere are two other major settlements in the municipality situated along the Pacific seaboard: Itbud and Imnajbu. Itbud is from the town proper or Centro while Imnajbu is farther north-east.\n\nThe land is varied. It changes from rocky hills along the coasts to grassy and forest hills in the interior. Most of the land has been cleared for farming.\n\nIn the language of the Ivatans, \"Uyugan\" means place of flowing water—which is never far away except in the town proper itself: Today's brook bed that cuts the town proper in half dried up during the severe earth movements of 1918.\n\nUyugan is politically subdivided into 4 barangays.\n\nIn the , Uyugan had a population of . The population density was .\n\nUyugan's population has not changed much since its founding as a separate township (municipality) on May 20, 1909. Its population is around a tenth of the population of Batanes.\n\nHalf of Uyugan's population lives in the town proper or Uyugan Centro that comprises the barangays of Kayuganan and Kayvaluganan.

They grew up there because of the sea and fresh waters necessary for their livelihood. All of the barangays have a main street as the core of their socio-economic life.\n\nMost of the people speak Ivatan as their first language, while most of the people speak Ilocano, Tagalog, and English as their second languages.\n\nUyugan's climate ranges from humid oceanic to sub-tropic. The Philippine Sea/Pacific Ocean to the east moderate the climate—cooling summers. It's coldest in January and warmest in May.\n\nJanuary temperatures average . May’s average temperatures range from .\n\nThe average (mean) annual air temperature is less than in January, but it's much more changeable in north-eastern Uyugan (Imnajbu).\n\nPrecipitation is heaviest during the non-summer months brought in by the typhoons that frequent the area. Uyugan's annual rainful varies, but is highest in the north and lowest in the south. The heaviest rainfuls happen in a belt lying inland from Mount Chakarangan in north-western Uyugan (Songet) to Mount Vatohayao in north-eastern Uyugan (Imnajbu).\n\nThe weather is foggy at the onset of the colder months, caused by the cold polar air from the north (Continental Asia/Siberia) meeting warm moist air from the south.\n\nThe Uyugan economy is mainly agriculture and fishing.\n\nFarming in Uyugan began long before the arrival of the Spaniards. The Ivatans loved the land and cultivated many plants for food.\n\nIsantonino farmers started with root crops, but when the Spaniards arrived, they learned to grow other crops, while introducing livestock and vegetables. Farming meant growing root crops—often just enough to feed the farmer's family.\n\nCamoté and other root crops became Uyugan's most hardy and widely grown crops, but in the 1950s, livestock became more important than root crops on Uyugan farms. The government brought breeding bulls and the farmers moved to \"mixed\" farming on a small scale.\n\nUyugan's farms are not scientific, but government agricultural extension workers give direction and support to farming methods. The farmers seldom have problems like plant and animal diseases and pests.\n\nToday's Isantonino farmer still could barely feed his family due to antiquated methods of farming dictated mainly by the topography of the land that at best is unsuitable to agriculture. Nevertheless, Uyugan was a leading producer of beef cattle and garlic prior to the global economy.\n\nFishing plays a role in partly meeting the fish requirements of the municipality. Fishing methods use hook and line and cast nets.\n\nSituated north of Imnajbu is Madi Bay in Mahatao, one of the richest fishing grounds in all of mainland Batanes, where Isantoninos (Uyugan) along with Isancarnos (Mahatao) and other Ivatans (Ivasays) engaged in coastal fishing.\n\n"}

It follows Diana Guzman, a troubled teenager from Brooklyn who decides to channel her aggression by training to become a boxer, despite the disapproval of both her father and her prospective trainers and competitors in the male-dominated sport.\n\nKusama wrote the screenplay for \"Girlfight\" after learning to box, wanting to make a film about the sport with a female protagonist. Although she struggled to find financiers for the film's $1 million (U.S.) budget, the production was eventually funded by John Sayles, Maggie Renzi and the Independent Film Channel. Rodriguez was cast in the lead role, despite having never acted before, and trained for four months to prepare for the role before filming commenced in New York and New Jersey.\n\n\"Girlfight\" premiered on January 22, 2000 at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury Prize. It was released theatrically on September 29, 2000 and grossed $1.7 million at the box office. The film was well received by critics, who offered particular praise to Rodriguez for her performance and Kusama for her direction. Both Kusama and Rodriguez received numerous accolades, including two National Board of Review Awards, two Independent Spirit Award nominations, and two Gotham Awards.\n\nDiana Guzman is a Brooklyn teenager whose hot temper gets her into trouble at school as she repeatedly starts fights with other students. Her frustration stems from her unhappy home life; she lives in a public housing estate with her brother Tiny and their single father, Sandro. Sandro pays for Tiny's boxing training in hopes of his becoming a professional boxer, although Tiny would prefer to be an artist.\n\nAfter visiting Tiny's gym and intervening in a spar to defend him, Diana asks the trainers to let her box, too. She is told she can train there, but not compete in actual fights. When she learns that she cannot afford coaching from Tiny's trainer, Hector Soto, she asks her father for an allowance but he tells her to get a job. She resorts to stealing his money instead and returns to the gym, where Hector begins to teach her the basics of boxing.\n\nDiana's first spar is with Adrian Sturges, whom she later meets again when Hector takes her to a professional fight. Adrian invites Diana to dinner after the fight and kisses her after walking her home. One night after a spar which gave Diana a black eye, Sandro sees Diana and Adrian together and confronts her, assuming that she is in an abusive relationship. She storms out of the apartment and spends the night with Adrian. When he asks about her parents, she reveals that her mother committed suicide several years ago. When Diana returns to her apartment, Tiny offers to give up boxing so that she can use the coaching money he gets from their father.\n\nDiana later goes to Hector's birthday party, but leaves when she sees Adrian getting friendly with his ex-girlfriend. When Diana and Adrian spar at their next session in the gym, he is reluctant to hit her, and she leaves before he can talk to her. Diana's first amateur match is scheduled against another girl, but when her opponent pulls out she ends up fighting a man, Ray Cortez. Sandro arrives in the middle of the fight to see the match end in Ray's disqualification for illegal shoving. When Diana arrives home, Sandro berates her for looking like a loser. She retaliates by beating him to the floor and accuses him of abusing her mother to the point of suicide.\n\nAfter weeks of rigorous training, Diana wins another amateur fight, this time against a girl, Ricki Stiles. Although Diana has accepted Adrian's apology, tensions rise between them again when they learn that they both have advanced to the finals in their division to fight each other. Adrian refuses to fight a girl and Diana struggles to convince him to view her as a legitimate opponent. He turns up for the fight on the day, however, and after an even match, Diana wins with a unanimous decision by the judges. After the fight, Adrian fears that he has lost Diana's respect, but she tells him she respects him even more for fighting her, and they reconcile.\n\n\n\"Girlfight\" was written and directed by Karyn Kusama, marking her feature film debut. Her aim was to subvert \"the classic boxing story\" with a female lead, having taken up boxing herself in 1992 at the famous Gleason's Gym in Brooklyn. After writing the script, she struggled to persuade production companies to finance the film; numerous producers suggested that Kusama cast a white woman in the lead role rather than a Latina and felt that having a female protagonist was \"unappealing [and] unbelievable\". Maggie Renzi, Sarah Green and Martha Griffin eventually agreed to produce the film, and found a financier in 1999 to provide the $1 million (U.S.) budget. Two days before pre-production on the film was set to begin the financier backed out, but Renzi and her partner John Sayles—an independent filmmaker and Kusama's former mentor—decided to provide funding for the film's entire budget themselves. The Independent Film Channel later contributed $300,000 towards the budget.\n\nKusama initially sought to cast a professional actor to play Diana but felt that many of those who auditioned were overly feminized and \"polished\" and decided to cast an untrained actor instead. Michelle Rodriguez, who had worked as a film extra but had never auditioned for a speaking role before, attended an open casting call for the lead. Although Kusama described Rodriguez's audition as \"a disaster\", she won the role because out of 350 auditionees Kusama \"could not find anyone who could come close to her in physical power\". Since Rodriguez was not a boxer, she trained at Gleason's Gym five to six days a week for four months in preparation for filming, as did Santiago Douglas, who played Adrian.\n\n\"Girlfight\" was filmed over 24 days in New York and New Jersey. For scenes inside the gym where Diana and Tiny train, the filmmakers shot in a warehouse in Jersey City. The initial boxing sequences were shot from a spectator's view outside of the ring but later sequences were filmed more intimately from inside the ring. Cinematographer Patrick Cady used camera rigs that allowed the actors to hit him or the camera itself to mimic the feeling of being hit.\n\n\"Girlfight\" premiered on January 22, 2000 at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won the festival's Grand Jury Prize and the Directing Award in Dramatic Competition. Distribution rights to the film were subsequently purchased by Screen Gems for $3 million.\n\nIt had a limited release in the United States on September 29, 2000, opening in 28 theaters. In its debut week, it ranked 30th at the box office, grossing $282,145 with a per-screen average of $10,077. The following week it expanded to 253 theaters, but fell to a per-screen average of $2,687, ranking 18th. In its third week, the film's per-screen average dropped to $1,156 with a cumulative total gross of $1,254,600. \"Girlfight\" ended its theatrical run after five weeks with a total domestic gross of $1,565,852. Internationally, it grossed $100,176, making a worldwide total of $1,666,028.\n\nThe film was released on DVD on March 27, 2001. The DVD includes two special features: an audio commentary by Karyn Kusama and a \"making of\" featurette.\n\n\"Girlfight\" was well received by critics upon its release. It has a score of 87% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 95 reviews with an average rating of 7.3 out of 10. The website's critical consensus states: \"Michelle Rodriguez gives a compelling performance, despite lack of a boxing background; Karyn Kusama packs a punch with this directorial debut.\" The film also has a score of 70 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 34 critics' reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nNumerous reviews praised Rodriguez's performance in her debut role, with several critics comparing her to Marlon Brando. David Denby of \"The New Yorker\" called her \"a powerhouse star who could go a long way\", while \"Variety\" critic Emanuel Levy described her as \"a natural performer who dominates every scene\". In a review for \"The New York Times\", A. O. Scott characterized Rodriguez as \"a powerful, extraordinarily gifted young actress ... Remember the name.\" \"The Washington Post\" Desson Howe felt that Rodriguez's performance was the most memorable aspect of the film, and that she \"becomes more appealing, formidable and beautiful by the scene\".\n\nKaryn Kusama's script and direction were also highlighted by critics. The \"Los Angeles Times\" Kenneth Turan commended her \"craft, empathy and respect\" and compared her to the character of Diana, writing that Kusama \"is her protagonist's double in terms of drive, commitment and ability\". Lisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt that, although the plot was clichéd and unrealistic at times, Kusama's direction showed \"a clear, personal filmmaking style ... and a respect for her characters' weaknesses as well as their moments of athletic beauty\". James Berardinelli gave the film three and a half stars out of four, calling it \"a well crafted and emotionally satisfying debut\" and applauding Kusama's \"single-minded determination and a passion for the project\".\n\nRoger Ebert, who gave the film three and a half out of four stars in a \"Chicago Sun-Times\" review, enjoyed that the story is \"always about more than boxing\" with its deeper themes \"about a girl growing up in a macho society and ... discovering she has a nature probably more macho than the men around her\". On the other hand, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" Edward Guthmann opined that Kusama \"ultimately undercuts her theme of female self-reliance by having Diana fall for Adrian\" and criticized the plot for \"tak[ing] too much time justifying a woman's right to be in the ring – instead of celebrating her achievement\".\n\n\"Girlfight\" was one of the first boxing films to portray women in the sport. Film studies academic Katharina Lindner has argued that \"Girlfight\" was responsible for the \"influx of female protagonists into the [boxing film] genre\" of the 2000s, specifically the 2004 films \"Million Dollar Baby\" and \"Die Boxerin\" (alternatively titled \"About a Girl\").\n\nThe film was responsible for launching Rodriguez and Kusama's careers in film; Rodriguez went on to star in numerous major studio films while Kusama later directed \"Æon Flux\" (2005) and \"Jennifer's Body\" (2009).\n\n"}

The hooker was developed for the strong seas there. It is identified by its sharp, clean entry, bluff bow, marked tumblehome and raked transom. Its sail plan consists of a single mast with a main sail and two foresails. Traditionally, the boat is black (being coated in pitch) and the sails are a dark red-brown.\n\nRecently there has been a major revival of and renewed interest in the Galway hooker, and the boats are still being painstakingly constructed. The festival of Cruinniú na mBád is held each year, when boats race across Galway Bay from Connemara to Kinvara on the Galway/Clare county boundary. \n\nThe hooker refers to four classes of boats. All are named in Irish. The \"Bád Mór\" (big boat) ranges in length from 10.5 to 13.5 metres (35 to 44 feet). The smaller \"Leathbhád\" (half-boat) is about 10 metres (28 feet) in length. Both the \"Bád Mór\" and \"Leathbhád\" are decked forward of the mast. These boats were used to carry turf to be used as fuel across Galway Bay from Connemara and County Mayo to the Aran Islands and the Burren. The boats often brought limestone on the return journeys, to neutralise the acid soils of Connemara and Mayo. The \"Gleoiteog\" ranges in length from 7 to 9 metres (24 to 28 feet), and has the same sails and rigging as the larger boats. They were used for fishing and carrying cargo. Another boat, the \"Púcán\", is similar in size to the \"Gleoiteog\" but has a lug mainsail and a foresail. These smaller boats were entirely open.\n\nThere was also a class fitted with a cockpit floor over the ballast used for fishing. When the Irish settlers at Boston in North America needed fishing craft, they built the hooker that they knew from home. These boats became known as 'Boston Hookers', 'Irish Cutters' (in official reports), or 'Paddy Boats'.\n\nWhile a very utilitarian boat, well suited for the shallow waters of Galway Bay and being capable of being beached where necessary, the Galway Hooker is prone to being swamped and sinking in a short time in the absence of a cabin and high freeboard. \n\nEighty-two shipwrecks are recorded in the unpublished 'Shipwreck Inventory of Wrecks for Galway Bay'. These wrecks date to between 1750 and 1938; of them, 59 are from the 19th century. No records are currently known to exist for the period prior to the 18th century. Cargo throughout this period would usually be held in wooden casks varnished with fish oil for waterproofing.\n\nThe origins of the craft are not clear. A major spark in the revival of interest was the publication in 1983 of \"The Galway Hookers: Sailing work boats of Galway Bay\" (Richard J. Scott, d 24/01/08)—now in its fourth edition—in which for the first time detailed construction and sail plans were published. \n\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling between 1995 and 1999 as the manager of many of the promotion's Japanese performers. He now lives modestly with his family and owns XTC Auto in Mason City, Iowa.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Onoo often took selfies with his wrestlers before selfies had become mainstream. \n\nOnoo was a qualified martial artist, competing in international kickboxing and martial arts tournaments between 1975 and 1987. The Professional Karate Association named him the best bantamweight in the world, and he won numerous accolades. While touring as a martial artist, Onoo befriended Eric Bischoff in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1994, Bischoff, by now the president of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), hired Onoo as an off-camera international consultant. Onoo was the liaison between WCW and New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), negotiating the talent exchange programs that saw numerous Japanese performers appear with WCW. Onoo's on-screen debut (billed as karate champion Kazuo Sonny Onoo) was in early 1995 at the Uncensored pay-per-view as a special referee in a Martial Arts match between Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Meng. A month later, he would be seen again as Kensuke Ishikawa, a member of the WCW International committee who voted for Ric Flair to be reinstated as a wrestler (Flair had lost a retirement match to Hulk Hogan at the 1994 Halloween Havoc). Onoo (referred to as Kazuo Ishikawa) also co-hosted the WCW presentation of Collision in Korea alongside Eric Bischoff and Mike Tenay.\n\nLater in 1995, Onoo became the on-screen manager Sonny Onoo, translating for a number of Japanese wrestlers who could not speak English. His signature look consisted of a stylish suit and small sunglasses. At Starrcade on December 27, 1995, Onoo led Team New Japan (Jushin Thunder Liger, Koji Kanemoto, Masahiro Chono, Masa Saito, Shinjiro Otani, Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Kensuke Sasaki) against Team WCW in a best-of-seven World Cup series. When Chono made a special appearance on \"WCW Monday Nitro\" in 1996, Chono immediately turned on him and became the first international member of the New World Order (nWo). Later, in 1997, Onoo brought in another New Japan star, The Great Muta, as a mystery opponent to get revenge on Chono. Like Chono, Muta immediately turned on Onoo, spitting his mist in Onoo's face before joining Chono in nWo Japan.\n\nDuring this time, Onoo also managed the Último Dragón. Thanks to his interference, Dragon defeated Dean Malenko to win the WCW Cruiserweight Championship at WCW's Starrcade pay-per-view in 1996. This win temporarily unified the title with the eight championships of the J-Crown. Dragon lost the J-Crown to Jushin Thunder Liger in Japan, while remaining WCW Cruiserweight Champion. He lost that title in a rematch with Malenko at WCW's \"Clash of the Champions XXXIV\" supercard, after botched interference by Onoo. Dragon then won the WCW Television Championship from Prince Iaukea on a \"Nitro\" in April and defended the title against former champion Steven Regal at Slamboree. Throughout the match, Onoo attempted to interfere on Dragon's behalf, but Dragon, preferring to win the match himself, admonished Onoo. Onoo then turned on Dragon, allowing Regal apply the Regal Stretch on Dragon to win back the title by submission.\n\nIn August 1996, Onoo managed Bull Nakano in her feud with Madusa. At WCW's Hog Wild event, Madusa defeated Nakano in the match with the stipulation that she was then allowed to destroy Nakano's motorcycle. At this time, Onoo also managed Malia Hosaka. Onoo then managed Akira Hokuto who won the WCW Women's Championship over Madusa in the finals of the tournament to crown the first champion on December 29 at Starrcade in Nashville, Tennessee. On April 6, 1997, Hokuto retained the title against Madusa at Spring Stampede. The feud between Hokuto and Madusa culminated in a Title vs. Career match on June 15 at The Great American Bash won by Hokuto. Madusa was forced to \"retire\" due to a stipulation. This was the last time Hokuto ever appeared in WCW and the Women's Championship was apparently dropped, as it was never defended or mentioned again.\n\nOnoo also turned his attention to managing many of WCW's luchadores, taking both Psychosis and La Parka under his wing to feud with Dragon. Psychosis faced Dragon in a \"Respect match\" at the 1997 Great American Bash, losing by submission to the Dragon Sleeper. Later, when luchador Konnan joined the nWo, Onoo sent both Psychosis and La Parka after him in subsequent matches on \"Nitro\", with both ending in defeat. Giving up on luchadores, Onoo managed WCW newcomer Yuji Nagata, to once again feud with Dragon. Nagata defeated Dragon by submission at Halloween Havoc and again by pinfall at World War 3, in a match where, had Dragon won, he would have five minutes in the ring alone with Onoo. Onoo parted ways with Nagata soon afterward.\n\nOnoo later became the manager of Ernest Miller and feuded with Perry Saturn, and later Jerry Flynn. Onoo's character spoke broken English and described himself as \"money-hungry, deceitful, conniving, and violent.\" During this time, he had a few matches, which he won. His character was originally depicted as an eccentric tourist who would take photographs of everyone he encountered. In general, their team was a reminiscence of the Jackie Chan's and Chris Tucker's characters from the film \"Rush Hour\".\n\nAfter being released by WCW in November 1999 (Bischoff was by then no longer with the company), Onoo, Bobby Walker, Hardbody Harrison and several African American wrestlers launched a racial discrimination lawsuit against AOL Time Warner. In the lawsuit, Onoo claimed wrongful dismissal. Onoo also said that he had been given a disrespectful gimmick and that his final salary—$160,000—was only half of the average pay for a wrestler at that time. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.\n\n\n"}

For orchestration of piano music, some theorists recommend transposing the music to D minor or E minor. If D-sharp minor must absolutely be used, one should take care that B wind instruments be notated in F minor, rather than E-sharp minor (or G instruments used instead, giving a transposed key of G-sharp minor), and D instruments in D minor instead of C minor, in order to avoid double sharps in key signatures. Meanwhile, the E horns would have parts written with a B minor key signature.\n"}

He is placed on an ancient ferry boat, the Fa Tsan (known to its crew as the Fat Annie), despite the protests of the pompous owner, Captain Cecil Hart.\n\nHe travels to Macau, but is refused entry for the same reason he was expelled from Hong Kong. He engages the captain in a card game and wins the right to 'live' on board. His charming manner endears him to the crew and to an attractive teacher Liz Ferrers, a regular passenger.\n\nThe ferry is nearly wrecked in a typhoon, but Conrad wrests command from the cowardly and drunken captain and saves the ship. Drifting out of control near the Chinese coast, they are boarded by pirates, led by Chinese-American Johnny Sing-up. Sing-up reveals that Hart is a former conman who won the ship in a crooked card-game.\n\nConrad becomes a hero when he saves the ship, and is allowed to stay in Hong Kong. He is tempted to continue his budding relationship with Liz, but decides to resist it until\nhe has 'beaten the dragon'.\n\n\nThe film was among those movies made by Rank to appeal to the international market, involving colour and location filming. Rank had rationalised its film production arm, decreasing overall output but putting more money in a certain number of films. Rank chairman John Davis said: \"It is vital that the greatest possible financial encouragement should be given to the making of important films: for these the public will gladly pay. The emphasis will be on the more expensive and important film.\"\n\nThe film was to originally star Burl Ives and contract star Peter Finch. However this soon became Curt Jurgens and Orson Welles. The movie had one of the largest budgets in the history of Rank.\n\nLewis Gilbert described \"Ferry to Hong Kong\" as \"my nightmare film\". Orson Welles, he said, \"never cared about his fellow actors, never cared about the director\". Gilbert says \"everything was wrong with the film - principally Orson Welles\".\n\nOriginally Jurgens was meant to play the ship captain and Welles the tramp but John Davis, head of Rank, insisted they change roles. The film was shot entirely on location. In Hong Kong the production team bought a boat that could be converted into a paddle steamer and used local labour to build a full sized studio stage and crane for the CinemaScope camera. The film was shot with guide tracks and every line of dialogue was re-recorded and re-synched in Pinewood. Welles and Jurgens hated each other and Gilbert had trouble filming them in the same shot. Welles insisted on wearing a false nose and at one point held up filming for two days while he could find his nose.\n\nThe film received bad reviews in England and was a disaster at the box office.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"a very funny comedy-drama\".\n"}

He is the founder of WallBuilders, LLC, a Texas-based organization that promotes unorthodox theories about the religious basis of the United States. \n\nBarton has been described as a Christian nationalist; his work is devoted to advancing the idea that the United States was founded as an explicitly Christian nation and rejecting the consensus view that the United States Constitution calls for separation of church and state. Scholars of history and law have described his research as highly flawed, \"pseudoscholarship\" and spreading \"outright falsehoods\".\n\nBarton is the former vice chair of the Republican Party of Texas and served as director of Keep the Promise PAC, a political action committee that supported the unsuccessful 2016 presidential campaign of US senator Ted Cruz.<ref name=\"Bloomberg.com/politics\"></ref>\n\nBarton is a lifelong resident of Aledo, Texas, a suburb of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. He graduated from Aledo High School in 1972. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in religious education from Oral Roberts University in 1976.\n\nBarton is married and has three grown children, including a daughter who performs minority outreach for the Republican Party of Texas. He has lived in Aledo, Texas, since his childhood; Aledo is also the site of the WallBuilders Library.\n\nAfter graduating from college, Barton served as a youth pastor at churches in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was employed as a teacher of math and science and eventually became principal at Aledo Christian School, a ministry of the charismatic church started by Barton's parents.\n\nIn 1987, Barton formed Specialty Research Associates, Inc., a company which states that it \"focuses on the historical research of issues relating to America's constitutional, moral, and religious heritage.\" Specialty Research Associates has submitted amicus curiae briefs in court cases.\n\nBarton is the founder and president of the Aledo-based group WallBuilders. WallBuilders publishes and sells most of Barton's books and videos, some of which present Barton's position that the modern view of separation of church and state is not consistent with the views of the Founders. Barton has argued that the religion clauses of the First Amendment were intended only for monotheistic religions, and perhaps solely Christianity. A 2005 \"Time\" magazine article entitled \"The 25 Most Influential Evangelicals\" called Barton \"a major voice in the debate over church–state separation\" who, despite the fact that \"many historians dismiss his thinking... [is] a hero to millions—including some powerful politicians.\" Barton has appeared on television and radio programs, including those of Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee and Glenn Beck. Beck has praised Barton as \"the Library of Congress in shoes\". In September 2013, he returned to the political arena and advised state legislators on how to fight the Common Core academic standards promoted by the Obama administration.\n\nBarton was from 1997 to 2006 the vice chairman of the Texas Republican Party under state chairman Susan Weddington. He has also acted as a political consultant to the Republican National Committee on outreach to evangelicals. There was a Tea Party movement to get him to run against Senator John Cornyn in the 2014 Senate election from Texas. However, Barton announced on November 6, 2013, that he would not run for the seat. Barton headed the Keep the Promise PAC, a political action committee supporting Ted Cruz during his campaign for election as U.S. President in 2016. Cruz failed to receive the Republican nomination.\n\nBarton's first non-self-published work was a 2003 article in the \"Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics & Public Policy\", (Volume XVII Issue No. 2, 2003, p. 399), a survey of Jefferson's writings about the First Amendment.\n\nBarton has served on the board of advisors of the Providence Foundation. In an article discussing Barton, \"The Nation\" described the Providence Foundation as \"a Christian Reconstructionist group that promotes the idea that biblical law should be instituted in America.\"\n\nAccording to Skipp Porteous of the Massachusetts-based Institute for First Amendment Studies, Barton was listed in promotional literature as a \"new and special speaker\" at a 1991 summer retreat in Colorado sponsored by Scriptures for America, a far-right Christian Identity ministry headed by Pastor Pete Peters, which has been linked to neo-Nazi groups. Barton's assistant Kit Marshall said in 1993 that Barton was previously unaware of the anti-Semitic and racist views of these groups. In September 2011, Barton sued two former Texas State Board of Education candidates for posting a video on YouTube that stated that he was \"known for speaking at white supremacist rallies\".\n\nBarton appeared on \"The 700 Club\", and \"The Daily Show\". In 2013, Barton appeared on Kenneth Copeland's \"Believer's Voice of Victory\" where he suggested that abortion caused climate change because God no longer protected the environment as punishment for legalized abortion.\n\nBarton has been praised by U.S. conservatives Mike Huckabee, Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann and Sam Brownback.\n\nHe has received criticism from others, including J. Brent Walker of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, Rob Boston of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Gordon College History professor Stephen Phillips, Senator Arlen Specter, The Anti-Defamation League, Senior Research Director for the Military Religious Freedom Foundation Chris Rodda, Messiah College history professor John Fea Baylor University historian Barry Hankins, and Grove City College professors Warren Throckmorton and Michael Coulter.\n\nBarton's official biography describes him as \"an expert in historical and constitutional issues\". Barton holds no formal credentials in history or law, and scholars dispute the accuracy and integrity of his assertions about history, accusing him of practicing misleading historical revisionism, \"pseudoscholarship\" and spreading \"outright falsehoods\". According to the \"New York Times\", \"Many professional historians dismiss Mr. Barton, whose academic degree is in Christian Education from Oral Roberts University, as a biased amateur who cherry-picks quotes from history and the Bible.\" Barton's 2012 book \"The Jefferson Lies\" was voted \"the least credible history book in print\" by the users of the History News Network website. The book's publisher, Christian publishing house Thomas Nelson, disavowed the book and withdrew it from sale. A senior executive said that Thomas Nelson could not stand by the book because \"basic truths just were not there.\"\n\nJay W. Richards, senior fellow at the Christian conservative Discovery Institute, said in 2012 that Barton's books and videos are full of \"embarrassing factual errors, suspiciously selective quotes, and highly misleading claims.\" The Southern Poverty Law Center describes Barton's work as \"anti-gay\" \"historical revisionism\", noting that Barton has no formal training in history. A number of writers have called Barton's work \"pseudohistory\", though this designation has been disputed by Robert Knight of the evangelical Coral Ridge Ministries.\n\nIn 1995, in response to criticism by historian Robert Alley, Barton conceded, in an online article titled \"Unconfirmed Quotations\", that he had not located primary sources for 11 alleged quotes from James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and U.S. Supreme Court decisions (hence, the title of the article), but maintained that the quotes were \"completely consistent\" with the views of the Founders. (By 2007, the article listed 14 unconfirmed quotations.) In 1996, Rob Boston of Americans United for Separation of Church and State accused Barton of \"shoddy workmanship\", and said that despite these and other corrections, Barton's work \"remains rife with distortions of history and court rulings\". WallBuilders responded to its critics by saying that Barton followed \"common practice in the academic community\" in citing secondary sources, and that in publishing \"Unconfirmed Quotations\", Barton's intent was to raise the academic bar in historical debates pertinent to public policy.\n\nIn 2006, Barton told the \"Texas Monthly\", with regard to Jefferson's famous letter to the Danbury Baptists, that he had never misquoted the letter in any of his publications. The magazine noted that this denial was contradicted by a 1990 version of Barton's video \"America's Godly Heritage\", in which Barton said:\nIn 2012, Barton's \"New York Times\" bestseller \"The Jefferson Lies: Exposing the Myths You've Always Believed About Thomas Jefferson\" (published April 10, 2012) was voted \"the least credible history book in print\" by the users of the History News Network website. A group of ten conservative Christian professors reviewed the work and reported negatively on its claims, saying that Barton misstated facts about Jefferson.\n\nIn August 2012 Christian publisher Thomas Nelson withdrew the book from publication and stopped production, announcing that they had \"lost confidence in the book's details\" and \"learned that there were some historical details included in the book that were not adequately supported.\" Glenn Beck, who wrote the foreword, announced that his Mercury Ink imprint would issue a new edition of the book once the 17,000 remaining copies that Barton bought of the Thomas Nelson edition had been sold.\n\nA revised edition of \"The Jefferson Lies\" was published by World Net Daily Books in January 2016.\n\n"}

Saint Kitts Creole does not have the status of an official language.\n\nSaint Kitts Creole has much the same history as other English Caribbean creoles. Its origin lies in 17th-century enslaved West Africans, who, when brought to the islands to work on sugar plantations, were forced to learn British English quickly because their labour required it. Their English was mixed with West African words and, in some cases, West African language structure. The French, who occupied the island from 1625 to 1713, had only a small impact on the creole spoken today, unlike in the formerly French islands of Dominica and Saint Lucia, which speak a French-based rather than English-based creole.\n\nSaint Kitts Creole today is spoken on the islands of St. Kitts and Nevis (although Nevisians refer to the language as \"Nevisian\" or \"Nevis creole\"), mainly in rural areas, and is spoken especially heavily in Capesterre, Christ Church Nichola Town, Cayon, and Nevis. Today's use of the creole involves a higher proportion of Standard English, possibly due to access to foreign media. Usually, only residents in rural areas and Nevis are strong creole users, although mesolectal forms of the language are employed by the majority of the population. Popular Jamaican culture and music have also played a role, as Jamaican idioms are being used more and more in the Saint Kitts creole, as well as throughout the region.\n\nSaint Kitts pronunciation is similar to the pronunciation on the neighbouring islands of Antigua and Montserrat, but with slight differences that are mostly noticeable only to residents of the Leeward Islands.\n\nSaint Kitts Creole is pronounced similarly to the creoles of neighbouring islands, namely Antigua and Montserrat. Usually only longtime residents in the islands can mark the slight differences. In rural areas and in Nevis, (as in \"house\") is usually pronounced (as in \"hose\").\n\nIn Saint Kitts Creole, words are rarely pluralized by adding an ending to the word. The word is usually followed by the word \"dem\" to indicate the pluralization. e.g. - \"the girls\". Note that if the Standard English form of the word is not pluralized with an \"s\", e.g. \"children\", the plural form of the word in Saint Kitts creole will be the Standard English plural form followed by \"dem\", e.g. .\n\nQuestions ending in \"is it?\" have the \"is it\" replaced with \"y be\" (\"i bee\"); e.g. Who is it? - \"Who y be?\" What is it? - \"Wha y be?\"\n\nWords used to intensify adjectives, such as \"very\" and \"extremely\", are rarely used. Instead, the adjective in question is repeated; for example: \"De gyul look bad bad\" - \"The girl looks very ugly.\" Alternatively, the phrase \"so tail\" is placed after the adjective to indicate a strong emphasis or intensification; for example: \"De gyul look bad so tail\" - \"The girl looks extremely ugly.\"\n\nA unique aspect of Saint Kitts Creole is to end certain sentences in the speech with the words \"burdee\", \"poopa\" or \"daady buh\", the meaning of which vary with context but tend to be used to emphasise the sentence they attach to; for example: \"Tall poopa\" - \"not at all\" (extreme). \"Hush buhdee\" - \"hush buddy\" (used when extremely annoyed).\n\nThe word \"\"does\"\" is often traditionally inserted where it would not appear in Standard English sentence structure.\n\n\"I does only buy taman jam from she.\" I only buy tamarind jam from her.\n\n\"Whey yuh does be goin erry mawnin?\" Where do you go each morning?\n\n\"I does do dah too.\" I also do that.\n\n\"Yuh does guh by dey house?\" Do you visit their home?\n\nExamples of other linguistic divergences from Standard English are\n\n\"Ah does buy it\". I usually buy it.\n\n\"Ah did buy it.\" I bought it.\n\n\"Ah done buy it\". I already bought it. Also can be said as - \"Ah did buy it arready\".\n\n\"Ah goin buy it\". I will buy it.\n\n\"Ah goin guh buy it.\" I am on my way to buy it.\n\n\"Ahwee/Awe a go dung by e fiel by d house go pik nuts.\" - We are going down to the field by the house to pick peanuts.\n\n\"Is dey dem pikni does wash dem skin.\" - There is where the children bathe (their skin).\n\n\"Unno kno who e tis u a play wit u kno.\" - You do not know with whom you are messing.\n\nSome of the Saint Kitts Creole words listed below are unique, but others are commonly used in or originated from neighbouring islands.\n\n\nO me monkeys! = O My!\n\nAh geed = Yuck!\n\nBoy aye! = Aw man!\n\nEnt it? = Isn't that so\n\nWha mek? = How come\n\nM'ain know = I don't know\n\nLef me = Leave me alone\n\nTek een = Faint/pass out\n\nAr-you/Awu = You all\n\nArwee/Awe =Us\n\nStop play = Stop kidding around\n\nY'ain hear = I know right\n\nE suit you = Serves you right\n\nIn deh, in deh! = Take that\n\nDem = Them\n\nDey = They\n\n\"Sorry fuh mawgah dawg, mawgah dawg tun roun bite yuh\" - If you extend your charity to undeserving persons, they will be ungrateful/you will regret it.\n\n\"Pig bin arkse e mammee wah mek e mouth so long, e mammee tell um wait for you time\" - When you are older you will understand.\n\n\"Two man crab cyarn live in de the same hole\" - you can't have two persons in charge in a small environment.\n\n\"Monkey know wah limb to climb pon\" - People know who they can trouble/mess with.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is situated in the north-western periphery of Cagayan, bordering Apayao. It is the headquarters of GV Florida Transport.\n\nAllacapan has its beginning as a small village in the jungle vastness, inhabited by Negritoes, also known as Aetas. Ilocanos mainly from Ilocos Sur, among them future town mayor Santos Martinez, discovered it in quest for better land and eventually dominated the area.\n\nAllacapan was founded as a municipal district of Tawit, Mountain Province, in 1926. It was ceded to Cagayan in 1928, and finally became a regular municipality in 1945 by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 590 authored by Congressman Miguel Pio.\n\nThe history of Allacapan has a series of existing episodes and transitions. During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese forces established a garrison in the heart of the community from where echoed moars of torture inflicted upon prisoners of war, most often, innocent civilians. Later on, the Japanese burned the municipal hall, including the school building in the old site of Daan-Ili. The incident aggravated the fear of the civilians and they fled to the mountains.\n\nAfter liberation, disgruntled ex-Army men who were not satisfied with their backpay checks took to the hills with their rifles and joined the underground movement. Allacapan then became a hotbed of the Huks (HUKBALAHAP or Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon). Their atrocities resulted in the kidnapping of then Mayor Agustin Gorospe in September 1951, the burning of the newly constructed town hall, and the looting of the local treasury.\n\nThe construction of the highway from Magapit, Lallo to Bangag, Aparri traversing Allacapan and the opening of the Magapit Bridge to traffic, facilitated mobility of trade and commerce. Allacapan suddenly became a local point. It is now accessible from all points and is fast becoming an urban community.\n\nThe municipality's name came to be when Francisco Umengan, an ex-municipal president from Aparri, was annoyed by the skittering of dried leaves heaped within the vicinity. On his inquiry about the significance of the noise, his Negrito guide told him \"\"alla-appan\"\" meaning \"trap.\" Umengan then named the place \"Allacapan\" and the name has remained to the present.\n\nAllacapan is politically subdivided into 27 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Allacapan was people, with a density of .\n\n"}

In 1821 he published \"Letters to Richard Heber, Esq.\", in which he discussed the authorship of the then anonymous Waverley novels, and fixed it upon Sir Walter Scott. This conclusion was based on the resemblance of the novels in general style and method to the poems acknowledged by Scott.
