Born and raised in The Bronx, Dean began his musical career as a disc jockey (DJ). At the age of 18, he gained recognition in the hip hop industry through his friendship and work with East Coast rapper DMX and his family's Ruff Ryders Entertainment record label. Dean later found a protégé in Philadelphia-based rapper Cassidy, whose success helped the launch of his own label imprint, Full Surface Records in 1999. He went on to sign multiple artists to the label, including Eve, Mashonda, and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Dean also released two albums under the label; the first was a compilation, titled \"Swizz Beatz Presents G.H.E.T.T.O. Stories\", released in 2002, and later his debut studio album, \"One Man Band Man\" in 2007. In November 2018, Dean released his second studio album, \"Poison\", featuring collaborations with multiple hip hop artists.\n\nDean has produced many hit singles for a number of prominent artists across different music genres, such as hip hop, pop, soul and R&B. With a career spanning two decades, his catalog includes \"Ruff Ryders' Anthem\" and \"Party Up (Up in Here)\" (DMX), \"Gotta Man\" (Eve), \"Jigga My Nigga\" and \"Girl's Best Friend\" (Jay-Z), \"Upgrade U\", \"Check on It\" and \"Ring the Alarm\" (Beyoncé), \"Good Times\" (Styles P), \"Bring 'Em Out\" and \"Swing Ya Rag\" (T.I.), \"Hotel\" and \"I'm a Hustla\" (Cassidy), \"Touch It\" (Busta Rhymes) and \"Ultralight Beam\" (Kanye West), among others.\n\nDean was named the first \"Producer in Residence\" at New York University, for the 2010–11 academic year. About.com ranked him number 27 on its list of the \"Top 50 Greatest Hip-Hop Producers,\" and \"The Source\" included him on its list of the \"20 greatest producers\" in the magazine's 20-year history. Fellow American rapper and producer Kanye West called Dean \"the best rap producer of all time.\" Aside from music, Dean has also added multiple entrepreneurial endeavors to his repertoire, including fashion design, art collecting, and board directing. He's been a member of trustees at the Brooklyn Museum since 2015, and a creative director for the companies Monster Cable and Reebok. Dean is married to American musician Alicia Keys, with whom he has two children. The two were featured in their first cover shoot in 2018 for \"Cultured Magazine\".\n\nDean is of Puerto Rican and African American descendent. He spent much of his childhood raised by his mother in the North East Bronx, where he first encountered hip hop. After obtaining the necessary equipment from his stepfather and uncles, he began deejaying as a teenager and enjoyed a modicum of success. After relocating to Atlanta, Georgia, due to his repeated involvement in violent behavior at Harry S. Truman High School, he started to work for his uncles, Joaquin (Waah) and Darrin (Dee) Dean, who were co-CEOs of the Ruff Ryders Entertainment record label. In his early work, he generally chose not to sample, instead using the Korg Trinity and Triton keyboards and seeking to accentuate the performance aspect of his music.\n\nWith his uncles Waah & Dee, as well as his aunt Chivon Dean, all involved with the Ruff Ryders record label, Swizz Beatz began to produce tracks at age 16. A year later he sold his first beat to Ruff Ryders artist DMX, which became his chart-topping single \"Ruff Ryders' Anthem\". Dean then began producing major hip-hop songs released in 1998 such as \"Banned from T.V.\" by Noreaga, \"Money, Cash, Hoes\" by Jay-Z and more. The following year, he produced most of the songs of the Ruff Ryders compilation album \"Ryde or Die Vol. 1\", as well as the bulk of Eve's debut album. In 2001, in a joint venture with Clive Davis, Swizz Beatz established his own record label, Full Surface Records, which became a subsidiary of J Records. The first artist signed was Philadelphia-based rapper Cassidy.\n\nWhen Dean released his first compilation album \"Swizz Beatz Presents G.H.E.T.T.O. Stories\", in 2002, he began to get noticed for his production style and interesting ideas, as well as his protege and artist, Cassidy, who also started to gain recognition for his ability as well. The same year, Dean released two singles, \"Guilty\" and \"Bigger Business\", both of which charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Along with often being associated with Ruff Ryders and Roc-A-Fella Records, Dean began to expand his scope to include production of artists from more mainstream labels such as Elektra, Atlantic, Epic, Def Jam and Bad Boy Entertainment. His career largely grew from that point.\n\nIn February 2007, design duo Heatherette staged their Fall 2007 New York Fashion Week runway show, and Dean was asked to mix the music. In June 2007, Swizz Beatz produced and was featured on his Full Surface artist Cassidy's comeback single, \"My Drink n My 2 Step\", following a murder trial and a car accident. The song proved to be a hit, reaching the Top 40 of the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. On August 21, 2007, Dean released his solo debut studio album, \"One Man Band Man\". The album, preceded by the lead singles \"It's Me Bitches\" and \"Money in the Bank\", debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200 and sold 45,000 copies in its first week.\n\nOn October 19, 2007 he launched a contest called \"Share the Studio\", presented by Music Video 2.0 and \"The Source\" magazine. The contest was intended to be a continuation of the work from his debut album.\n\nLater that same year, Dean signed former Ruff Ryders cohorts and longtime friends, Drag-On and Eve, to Full Surface Records. He also signed legendary Cleveland-based hip hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, where they later released their seventh studio album \"Strength & Loyalty\" in May, which Dean executive produced.\n\nIn a December 2007 interview with \"Format Magazine\", Dean stated that he was already working on his second studio album, at the time under the title \"Life After the Party\".\n\nIn 2008, Dean began working on his second studio album. In late 2007, in an interview with \"Format Magazine\" he had announced the title as \"Life After the Party\" saying: \"The opportunities that I've got from doing my album (\"One Man Band Man\") are much bigger than just producing. A lot of things came from me being able to put a voice to my face. It was me just expressing myself and having the opportunity to – it was the one man band. And now I'm doing part two, which is \"Life After the Party\".\"\n\nIn March 2009, Dean released a song titled \"You Stay on My Mind\". On April 24, 2009, he released a promotional song for Hennessy Black, entitled \"When I Step in the Club\". A music video, directed by Hype Williams, was also released. In 2009, Dean produced many popular singles including \"Nasty Girl\" by Ludacris featuring Plies, \"Who's Real\" by Jadakiss featuring OJ da Juiceman, \"Million Bucks\" by Maino, \"Million Dollar Bill\" by Whitney Houston, \"I Can Transform Ya\" by Chris Brown featuring Lil Wayne, and \"On to the Next One\" by Jay-Z.\n\nOn February 12, 2010, he and 81 other artists including Kanye West, Lil Wayne, Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, Jamie Foxx, Will.i.am, and Usher, debuted \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti\" during the Opening Ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Inspired by \"GOOD Fridays\" the 2010 weekly series of free mp3s from Kanye West, Swizz Beatz launched his own series entitled \"Monster Mondays\" later that year. The first offering, \"DJ Play that Beat\", featured Estelle, and was released on October 25. Other \"Monster Monday\" tracks feature Rakim, Pusha T, DMX, Busta Rhymes, Pharrell and many more.\n\nDean's second album in the works had been renamed on three occasions: initially, the album was renamed \"King Issues\", and was later retitled \"The Perception of Greatness\". After initially turning to fans to help decide on an album title, Dean eventually announced in August 2010, while in a New York City recording session with Mary J. Blige, that the title would be \"Haute Living\", as \"it's the perfect phrase to state what he's all about\". In November 2010, Dean previewed the album and confirmed guest appearances from Bono, Travis Barker, Kanye West, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, Lenny Kravitz, Mary J. Blige and John Legend, as well as his wife Alicia Keys.\n\nIn April 2011, in an exclusive listening session with Rap-Up.com, Dean premiered fourteen tracks set to appear on the album, including \"V.I.P. Chillin\" and also several previously unheard songs, including \"Dance Like a White Girl\" and \"Instructions\". He also premiered unfinished versions of several music videos made for the album, revealing that the Reebok-commissioned video for \"International Party\" cost $1.4 million to shoot, and that the video for \"You Stay on My Mind\" was shot in Dubai: he also revealed that he persuaded the Sheikh to let him use the airspace for only a dollar. Dean announced that he was planning to release the album on September 13, to coincide with his birth date. Rather than being released under his own imprint, the album is set to be released under his legal contract with Everest Entertainment/Atlantic Records/Warner Music Group, who signed the rapper in August 2010.\n\nHis first Grammy Award came in 2011, awarded in the category of Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for a track entitled \"On to the Next One\" teaming him with American rapper Jay-Z. The first promotional single from \"Haute Living\" was entitled \"Everyday (Coolin')\", features a verse from Eve, was produced by Joe Lindsay, and was released through \"monstermondays.com\" on March 28, 2011. In an April 2011 interview with Paper Mag, Dean revealed that a few yet-to-be-released special collaborations will appear on the album including one titled \"Skyscrapers\" featuring Kanye West and Bono: \"We got this song–it's me, Bono and Kanye on this one song called “Skyscrapers.” I recorded with Kanye in the studio and then I recorded with Bono in this actual studio right here. Mary J. Blige is on the album too; John Legend. But they're all on the album in super amazing ways. It's not like a compilation–it's a nice mixture of creativity. I had no boundaries with it; I had great partners on the album–Reebok was supporting me.\"\n\nIn May 2011, during an interview with BBC Radio 1Xtra's DJ Semtex, Swizz Beatz announced the release of his upcoming third solo album \"Haute Living\", would be released on his birthday, September 13, 2011. In July 2011, Swizz Beatz said instead of releasing all of the songs at once, he would release the tracks over an extended period of time: \"Let me clarify: Haute Living is still coming, but as far as releasing all on one day, I'm not doing that no more,” he said. “I want to just drop singles from \"Haute Living\" instead of 'I'm coming on September 13.' I'm like, 'You know what? Let me make every song an event, instead of just that one day being an event.'\"\n\nDean and his Monster Music Group signed a joint venture with Imagem Music USA. In a press release, the artist confirmed his excitement at his upcoming partnership with Richard Stumpf and the entire group over at Imagem Music, saying: \"This partnership will enable me to further develop my group of talented producers and also introduce many new producers and writers to the world”. Protegé Musicman Ty and Naki \"Snagz\" Levy were the first acts to sign with Monster Music Publishing, and on May 21, 2011, he further confirmed that Dr. Dre was working on the album with him.\nIn March 2012, Dean announced that he would be releasing a mixtape titled \"Limitless\", featuring guest appearances from DMX, Nas, Rick Ross, The LOX and ASAP Rocky, the latter of whom is featured on the first single, \"Street Knock\". On March 22, 2012, \"Street Knock\" featuring ASAP Rocky was premiered on \"The Angie Martinez Show\". In October 2012, at the 2012-2013 New York Knicks Season Tip-Off event at the Beacon Theater on 73rd Street and Broadway, special guest Swizz Beatz performed a 10-minute medley of his hits, alongside the New York Knicks' City Dancers and premiered the starting line-up theme song for the upcoming season, which he produced. On November 2, 2012, he released a new single titled “Everyday Birthday”, featuring Chris Brown and Ludacris. Dean produced the song with Jukebox. On August 23, 2013, he released \"Hands Up\", a new single featuring American rappers Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, and 2 Chainz. On October 21, 2014, he released \"Freaky\", a new single featuring American rapper La'Vega.\n\nIn May 2014, Dean was inducted into the Bronx Walk of Fame, where he received a street named in his honor, called “Swizz Beatz Street.”\n\nIn September 2015, it was announced that Dean would host the third annual Global Spin Awards.\n\nIn June 2017, Dean and One Man Kru appeared as the only two American talents on the 6th season of popular South Korean hip hop TV show \"Show Me The Money\".\n\nIn May 2018, Dean released the song \"It's Okayyy\", which will not be on his upcoming album \"Poison\". He recorded 70 songs and used 10 for the album. \"Poison\" will feature Kendrick Lamar, Lil Wayne, Pusha T, Nas, Young Thug, The Lox, 2 Chainz, among others. In July 2018, Dean said he worked with Nas on the latter's follow-up to his 2018 release \"Nasir\". Dean released \"Pistol on My Side\" featuring Lil Wayne from \"Poison\", along with its music video, on September 14, 2018.\n\nIn 2003, he became a partner involved in the popular clothing company Kidrobot, a creator and retailer of limited-edition art toys and clothing.\n\nOn Twitter in 2010, Dean revealed his new sneaker line with Reebok.\n\nDean is an avid art collector and connoisseur actively projecting and displaying his taste via Instagram. The curated collection of favourites was first introduced at SCOPE Art Show Miami Beach and has since become known as The Dean Collection, it includes work from emerging and well established artists including KAWS, Keith Haring, Cleon Peterson, Ernest Zacharevic and Erik Jones.\n\nDean and Keys are co-chairs of the Gordon Parks Foundation, which permanently preserves the work of Gordon Parks, a pioneering photographer, filmmaker, musician and activist. The couple acquired what is now the largest private holding of Parks' images and what is now part of the Dean Collection, the couple's philanthropic organization and family collection of international contemporary art. In the summer of 2018, Dean and Keys were featured in \"Cultured Magazine\" for their first joint cover, where they delved into Parks' works and the Dean Collection in more depth.\n\nDean also paints in his free time. He donates the money he earns from his paintings to the Children's Cancer & Blood Foundation.\n\nIn 2010, Dean became involved in the design and launch of the Aston Martin Rapide. In 2011, Swizz Beatz became the official face of Lotus cars until CEO Dany Bahar left the company. Subsequently, Swizz Beatz returned to Aston Martin for 2013.\n\nIn early 2013, Dean invested in and joined the board of Monster, and became involved in product management and marketing activities. Monster products that he is promoting include the Monster GODJ and the Monster 24K headphones.\n\nDean currently sits as the Vice President - Sports Style Marketing, Design, and Brand Music Development for global footwear and apparel giant Reebok.\n\nOn August 9, 2019 it was announced that Dean and his wife, singer Alicia Keys, are planning to transform a large piece of property in Macedon, New York into a music paradise of sorts. The couple wants to make a performing arts center and recording studio out of the former Jindal Films center which includes 111 acres and 3 buildings.\n\nDean is a Muslim. Dean and singer Mashonda Tifrere began dating in 1998. Their first pregnancy ended in a stillbirth in 2000. In 2000, Dean's son, Nasir Dior, with Nichole Levy was born. Dean and Tifrere married in 2004. In December 2006, their son, Kasseem Dean Jr. was born. Dean also has a daughter Nicole, born in May 2008, with UK-based singer Jahna Sabastian, whom he met in 2007. Dean found out about his daughter a year after her birth. In 2008, Dean and Tifrere announced their break up. According to Dean, they had been separated nine or 10 months by June 2008. Their divorce was finalized in May 2010, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nDean dated Alicia Keys, whom he has known since they were teens. They announced they were engaged and expecting their first child in May 2010. During the time of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the couple took part of a union and had their unborn child blessed in a Zulu ceremony, which took place in the Illovo suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa. They married on July 31, 2010 in a private ceremony near the Mediterranean Sea. Keys gave birth to their first son Egypt Daoud Dean in October 2010. Their second son, Genesis Ali Dean, was born in December 2014.

In October 2017, Dean shared a video on social media, celebrating the final days leading up to his graduation: \"It’s been a blessing coming from the Bronx, going to Harvard. A lot of people were saying why would you go to school? It’s never too late to get your education, further your education.” He continued by encouraging others to seek education as well. “Knowledge is power. It don’t have to be an Ivy league school. Just as long as you’re doing your thing, do your thing.” In November 2017, Dean confirmed he had graduated from the OPM program.\n\nIn March 2016, Dean announced that his son Egypt was a credited producer on Kendrick Lamar's compilation, \"Untitled Unmastered\".\n\n\n\n!Ref.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1934520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934520", "title": "...Nothing Like the Sun", "text": "...Nothing Like the Sun\n\n...Nothing Like the Sun is the second solo studio album by English singer-songwriter Sting. The album was originally released on 13 October 1987 on A&M (worldwide). The album explores the genres of pop rock, soft rock, jazz, reggae, world, acoustic rock, dance-rock, and funk rock. The songs were recorded during March–August in 1987 in sessions that took place at Air Studios, in Montserrat, assisted by record producers Hugh Padgham, Bryan Loren, and Neil Dorfsman. It features a number of high-profile guest guitarists, including former Police member Andy Summers, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, and Hiram Bullock, and is generally regarded as the culmination of the smoother, more adult-oriented sound of Sting's early work.\n\nOn release, the album was received favorably by the majority of music critics and in 1989, the album was ranked #90 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"100 Best Albums of the Eighties\". \"We'll Be Together\", \"Be Still My Beating Heart\", \"Englishman in New York\", \"Fragile\", and \"They Dance Alone\" were all released as singles.\n\nIt won Best British Album at the 1988 Brit Awards. In 1989 the album received three Grammy nominations including Album of the Year while the album's second single (\"Be Still My Beating Heart\") was nominated for Song of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.\n\nThe title comes from Shakespeare's Sonnet No. 130 (\"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun\"), which Sting used in the song \"Sister Moon\". He added that his inspiration for this was a close encounter with a drunk, in which Sting quoted the sonnet in response to the drunk's importunate query, \"How beautiful is the moon?\"\n\nThe album was influenced by two events in Sting's life: first, the death in late 1986 of his mother, which contributed to the sombre tone of several songs; and second, his participation in the Conspiracy of Hope Tour on behalf of Amnesty International, which brought Sting to parts of Latin America that had been ravaged by civil wars, and introduced him to victims of government oppression. \"They Dance Alone (Cueca Solo)\" was inspired by his witnessing of public demonstrations of grief by the wives and daughters of men missing in Chile, tortured and murdered by the military dictatorship of the time, who danced the \"Cueca\" (the traditional dance of Chile) by themselves, with photos of their loved ones pinned to their clothes. \"Be Still My Beating Heart\" and \"The Lazarus Heart\" approach the subjects of life, love and death. Elsewhere on the album, \"Englishman in New York\", in honour of Quentin Crisp, continues the jazz-influenced music more commonly found on Sting's previous album, as does \"Sister Moon\". \"The Lazarus Heart\" was originally written by Sting as the musical finale of the 1988 film, \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" in an early draft in which the novel, \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\"'s tragic ending where Roger is killed in the crossfire in the final duel was still in the script. When Disney ordered it's default ending (where Roger is still alive in the final duel) to be used, the song got deleted and ended up on Sting's album instead.\n\nThe album's first single and biggest hit, \"We'll Be Together\" sported a prominent dance beat and funk overtones; it reached No. 7 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 charts in late 1987 and even crossed over to the R&B charts.\n\nThe album also inspired a Spanish/Portuguese counterpart, the 1988 mini-album \"Nada Como el Sol\". It featured four of the songs from the album sung in either Spanish or Portuguese, and in the case of \"Fragile\", both languages. The Brazilian CD edition of \"...Nothing Like the Sun\" also contained \"Fragile\" in Portuguese (\"Frágil\") as the tenth track (between \"Rock Steady\" and \"Sister Moon\").\n\nThree years after its release on both the album and in single form, \"Englishman in New York\" was remixed in mid-1990 by Dutch producer Ben Liebrand. Providing a stronger dance beat, as well as an extended introduction, the song was a hit in clubs and reached number 15 in the UK pop charts. The maxi-single also included a dance remix of \"If You Love Somebody (Set Them Free)\" as a B-side.\n\n\"...Nothing Like the Sun\" was one of the first fully digital audio recordings (DDD) to achieve multi-platinum status.\n\n\"...Nothing Like the Sun\" was praised by many critics. In a review for \"Rolling Stone\", Anthony DeCurtis wrote: \"\"...Nothing Like the Sun\" represents [an] impressive growth for Sting. His voice is rich, grainy and more mature; his ideas are gaining in complexity; and musically he is stretching without straining. His mistress's eyes may be nothing like the sun, but on this fine new album Sting's intrepid talent shines on brightly.\" In 1989, the album was ranked number 90 on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of the \"100 Best Albums of the Eighties\".\n\nAllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited the track \"We'll Be Together\" as a highlight, while praising the album as a whole, writing: \"If \"Dream of the Blue Turtles\" was an unabashedly pretentious affair, it looks positively lighthearted in comparison to Sting's sophomore effort, \"Nothing Like the Sun\", one of the most doggedly serious pop albums ever recorded.\" Erlewine added, \"If \"Nothing Like the Sun\" runs a little too long, with only his Gil Evans-assisted cover of 'Little Wing' standing out in the final quarter, it still maintains its tone until the end\" and noted that \"it's one of his better albums.\"\n\nThere were harsher assessments elsewhere, with some critics like Robert Christgau of \"The Village Voice\" and Ira Robbins of \"Trouser Press\" also disparaging it as \"pretentious.\" Robbins in particular was highly critical, calling it \"self-important...a tedious, bankrupt and vacuous cavern of a record.\" \"Chicago Tribune\" critic Greg Kot felt that Sting's \"nuanced singing and literate lyrics\" were \"weighed down by ponderous music.\"\n\nIn the United States, the album debuted at number 54 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart on the week of 31 October 1987 and eventually peaked at number nine in its third week of release. The album spent a total of 52 weeks on the chart. On 24 October 1991, the album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over two million copies in the United States.\n\nIn the UK, the album debuted and peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart. In the second week the album dropped to number three. It spent a total of 42 weeks on the chart. The album was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales of over 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "1934521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934521", "title": "Transactional distance", "text": "Transactional distance\n\nTransactional distance theory was developed in the 1970s by Dr. Michael G. Moore, Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Education at the Pennsylvania State University (Moore, 1980). It is the first pedagogical theory specifically derived from analysis of teaching and learning conducted through technology as opposed to the many theories developed in the classroom. It is considered by some to be one of the few, if not the only, theory in distance education that can be used to test hypotheses. It can be used to frame experiments in tutoring or other learner support activities to assess what change there is in the outcomes of student learning, often judged by student completion (Tait, 2017). Like any theory, the transactional distance model serves as a heuristic device, a means of identifying questions for research and also a very practical instrument to be used in making these difficult instructional design decisions.\n\nThe theory consists of a set of principles and a model that defines the pedagogical aspects of education (as contrasted with others such as management and policy) in three sets of variables. The first set consists of elements describing the structure of what is designed to be learned, the second in the interaction or dialog between teacher and learners when that structured program is implemented, and the third is the idiosyncrasies of each individual learner with priority given to the potential self-management or autonomy of the students who interact with teachers within the designed structure (Moore & Kearsley, 2012).\nTransactional distance theory states that when an instructional designer makes decisions, these decisions will result in a certain amount of structure, dialog and autonomy. These amounts can be either unwitting consequences of the instructional design process, or the result of conscious instructional design decisions. Regardless, these variables interact to create transactional distance which Michael G. Moore defines as “a psychological and communication space to be crossed, a space of potential misunderstanding between the inputs of instructor and those of the learner.” Thus, the utility of the theory is that it provides guidance to instructional designers as to how to design the course: e.g. how much structure, dialog, and autonomy to build into the course, so as to minimize transactional distances and thereby maximize learning outcomes.\n\nA number of researchers have used Moore's theory as the theoretical underpinning for the development of a number of statistically valid and reliable scales to measure transactional distances. Some of these are listed below together with a brief description.\n\n\"Zhang’s Scale of Transactional Distance (2003):\" By the turn of the millennium, distance education had evolved from being synonymous with correspondence courses to being largely web-based. Aixu (Monica) Zhang built on Michael G. Moore's theory by proposing that transactional distance could be viewed as a measure of the student's difficulty in becoming actively engaged with their online learning environment. She defined transactional distance by four sets of variables (the Transactional Distance between Students and Students (TDSS), the Transactional Distance between Students and the Teacher (TDST), the Transactional Distance between the Student and the Content (TDSC), and the Transactional Distance between the Student and the Instructional Technology (TDSI). She found that these four sets of variables were highly and statistically correlated with Student Satisfaction, which she adopted as her surrogate measure for Transactional Distance. Her work lead to a 31 element statistically reliable and significant Scale of Transactional Distance.\n\n\"Relative Proximity Theory (Swart et al., 2013):\" Zhang's Scale of Transactional Distance provides a numerical measure for transactional distance based on a five-point Likert Scale. Such a measure assumes meaning only when compared to another similar measure such as, for example, in a statistical pre –post intervention comparison. Many studies do not lend themselves to pre-post intervention comparisons. Relative Proximity Theory borrows from gap, or needs analysis (Kaufman & Guerra, 2013) to yield the transactional distance between an actual and desired state. For example, the transactional distance between an actual class and an ideal class.\n\n\"Revised Scale of Transactional Distance (Paul et al., 2015):\" There are many changes in the educational environment that have occurred since Zhang developed her Scale of Transactional Distance: Online education is the fastest growing segment of higher education, mobile computing has become ubiquitous, MOOC's provide an unprecedented amount of online content to learners and instructors alike. Zhang's model was re-evaluated in light of these changes. The results provided a 12 element parsimonious version of Zhang's scale which has excellent factorial validity and reliability, yields better fit statistics, and is easier and less time consuming to apply than the original scale.\n\n\"Coll-TD Scale (Wengrowicz et al., 2014):\" This scale builds on Michael G. Moore's Theory of Transactional Distance to measure the transactional distances of students who are conducting research in virtual group collaborative environments. It defines Transactional Distance as composed of six sets of variables (Communication between Peers, Understanding between Peers, Communication between Peers and Instructor, Understanding between Peers and Instructor, Prior Attitude toward Collaboration, and Satisfaction). This yielded a 40 element statistically reliable and valid instrument.\n\n\"Coll-TD/F Scale (Swart et al., 2015):\" This instrument extends the Coll-TD Scale to Flipped Classrooms where collaboration takes place both f2f, during interactive group learning sessions, and outside class (virtual or f2f) during collaboration on projects or take home exams. This 46 element scale was also shown to be statistically valid and reliable.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1922, at the age of 34, he was appointed general music director of the Bavarian State Opera, holding that post for eleven years. In 1936 the Nazi régime dismissed him. As a freelance he was a frequent guest conductor in Vienna and Bayreuth, where his performances of \"Parsifal\" became celebrated.\n\nStudio recording did not suit Knappertsbusch, whose best-known recordings were made live during performances at Bayreuth. He died at the age of 78, following a bad fall the previous year.\n\nKnappertsbusch was born in Elberfeld, today's Wuppertal, on 12 March 1888, the second son of a manufacturer, Gustav Knappertsbusch, and his wife Julie, \"née\" Wiegand. He played the violin as a child, and later the cornet. By the age of 12 he was conducting his high school orchestra. His parents did not approve of his aspirations to a musical career, and he was sent to study philosophy at Bonn University. From 1908 he also attended the Cologne Conservatory, where he studied conducting with the principal, Fritz Steinbach.\n\nHe conducted at the Mülheim-Ruhr theatre from 1910 to 1912; more significant, according to \"Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians\", were his summers as assistant to Siegfried Wagner and Hans Richter at Bayreuth.\n\nKnappertsbusch began his career with a conducting post in Elberfeld. During the First World War he served in the German army as a non-combatant musician based in Berlin. In May 1918 he married Ellen Selma Neuhaus, who also came from Elberfeld. They had one child, Anita (1919–1938). After conducting in Leipzig (1918–1919), he succeeded in 1919 at Dessau, becoming Germany's youngest general music director.\n\nWhen Bruno Walter left Munich for New York in 1922, Knappertsbusch succeeded him as general music director of the Bavarian State Orchestra and the Bavarian State Opera. In 1925 Knappertsbusch and his wife divorced. The following year he married Marion von Leipzig (1888–1984); this marriage, which was childless, lasted for the rest of his life. \n\nKnappertsbusch remained in Munich for eleven years. He invited guest conductors such as Richard Strauss and Sir Thomas Beecham, and won high praise for his own conducting. After a 1931 \"Parsifal\", one reviewer wrote, \"Few conductors have the courage to take this opera slowly enough. Professor Knappertsbusch, however, gave a thoroughly well-balanced interpretation … full of life, full of philosophy and full of charm\". The same reviewer observed that Knappertsbusch's experience at Bayreuth before the war had given him an advantage over rival conductors such as Arturo Toscanini and Wilhelm Furtwängler. He was musically conservative, but conducted the premieres of seven operas during his time at Munich: \"Don Gil von den grünen Hosen\" by Walter Braunfels, \"Das Himmelskleid\" by Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari, \"Samuel Pepys\" by Albert Coates, \"Die geliebte Stimme\" by Jaromír Weinberger, \"Lucedia\" by Vittorio Giannini, and \"Das Herz\" by Hans Pfitzner. A visiting English conductor, Adrian Boult, found Knappertsbusch's performances of Mozart lacking in rhythmic precision, but praised his conducting of Wagner, remarking that even Arthur Nikisch could not have produced a more overwhelming performance of \"Tristan und Isolde\".\n\nIn 1936 the Nazis, who had been in power in Germany since 1933, revoked Knappertsbusch's lifetime contract at the State Opera. There were evidently several reasons for this: he refused to the join the Nazi Party and was frequently rude about the régime; budgetary constraints meant little to him; and Adolf Hitler, who had strong ideas about music, did not like his slow tempi, calling him \"that military bandleader\".\n\nDuring the next nine years, Knappertsbusch worked mostly in Austria conducting at the Staatsoper and the Salzburg Festival, and continuing a long association with the Vienna Philharmonic. He guest-conducted in Budapest, and at Covent Garden, London. He was allowed to go on conducting under Nazi rule, although Munich remained closed to him. In Vienna, on 30 June 1944, he conducted the last performance at the old Staatsoper, which was destroyed by bombing hours later. The president of the Vienna Philharmonic recalled:\nAfter the war there was a widespread desire in Munich for Knappertsbusch's return, but like the other leading musicians who had worked under the Nazi régime he was subject to a process of denazification, and the occupying American forces appointed Georg Solti as general music director of the State Opera. Solti, a young Jewish musician who had been in exile in Switzerland during the war, later recalled:\nAfter this Knappertsbusch mostly freelanced. He declined an invitation to conduct at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, but continued to appear as a guest artist in Vienna and elsewhere, and became a pillar of the Bayreuth Festival. He conducted the first performances of \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" at the festival's post-war reopening in 1951. He was outspoken in his dislike of Wieland Wagner's frugal and minimalist productions, but returned to the festival most years for the rest of his life. He was most associated there with \"Parsifal\": of his 95 appearances at Bayreuth, 55 of them were conducting it. He worked mainly in Germany and Austria, but conducted in Paris from time to time, including a 1956 \"Tristan und Isolde\" with Astrid Varnay at the Opéra. He returned to the Bavarian State Opera in 1954, and continued to conduct there for the rest of his life. In 1955 he returned to the Vienna State Opera, to conduct \"Der Rosenkavalier\" as one of the productions given to mark the re-opening of the theatre.\n\nIn 1964 Knappertsbusch had a bad fall, from which he never fully recovered. He died on 26 October the following year at the age of 78, and was buried in the Bogenhausen cemetery in Munich. He was greatly mourned by his colleagues. In 1967, the record producer John Culshaw wrote:\nKnappertsbusch, known familiarly as \"Kna\", was described as a \"ruppigen Humanisten\" (\"rough humanist\"). He was capable of ferocious tirades in rehearsal – usually at singers: he got on much better with orchestras. Culshaw wrote of him:\nKnappertsbusch did not take the gramophone as seriously as some of his colleagues did. Although he was praised for such recordings as his 1931 Munich version of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony (\"a monument of unfaltering fire\", according to one reviewer), he was not at home in the recording studio. Culshaw wrote:\nFor Decca, Knappertsbusch recorded mostly with the Vienna Philharmonic, but also with the London Philharmonic, the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra, the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra and the Suisse Romande Orchestra. Wagner, including a complete studio recording of \"Die Meistersinger\", predominated, but also included were works by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Schubert, Strauss (Johann and family as well as Richard), Tchaikovsky and Weber. Recordings made for RIAS feature Knappertsbusch conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in symphonies by Beethoven (No. 8), Bruckner (No. 8 and No. 9), Haydn (The \"Surprise\"), and Schubert (The \"Unfinished\"). The same forces recorded \"The Nutcracker Suite\" and Viennese dance and operetta music.\n\nSome of Knappertsbusch's best-received recordings were made during live performances at Bayreuth in the 1950s and 1960s. A \"Parsifal\" from 1951 was issued by Decca, and a 1962 performance was recorded by Philips. Both have remained in the catalogues, and when the 1962 set was transferred to CD, Alan Blyth wrote in \"Gramophone\", \"this is the most moving and satisfying account of \"Parsifal\" ever recorded, and one that for various reasons will not easily be surpassed. Nobody today … can match Knappertsbusch's combination of line and emotional power\". In 1951 the Decca team also recorded \"The Ring\" conducted by Knappertsbusch, but for contractual reasons it could not be published at the time.\n\n\n"}

Rye beers are considered \"specialty beers\" that are brewed with unusual fermentables such as rice, corn, or wheat. \n\nOne example of this is roggenbier which is a specialty beer produced with up to sixty percent rye malt. The style originated in Bavaria, in southern Germany, and is brewed with the same type of yeast as a German hefeweizen, resulting in a similar light, dry, spicy taste.\n\nIn the United States, another style of rye beer is being developed by homebrewers and microbreweries. In some examples, the hop presence is pushed to the point where they resemble American India pale ales (IPAs). This style is often called a Rye IPA, or just a \"Rye-P-A\", a take-off of the abbreviation for an India Pale Ale: \"IPA.\"\n\nFinnish sahti is another style of rye beer, produced by brewing rye with juniper berries and wild yeast.\n\nAnother type of rye beer is the traditional Slavic kvass, although the alcohol is low enough to be considered a non-alcoholic beer in many cases; it is made using bread that has been steeped and fermented.\n\nUntil the 15th century, it was common in Germany, particularly in Bavaria, to use rye malt for brewing beer. However, after a period of bad harvests, it was ruled that rye would be used only for baking bread, thus only barley was to be used for beer; see the German law known as the Reinheitsgebot. Roggenbier disappeared for almost five hundred years. \n\nIn the late 1980s the Spezialbrauerei Schierling near Regensburg created the first modern Roggenbier, Schierlinger Roggen, using a modified, patented mashing regime to cope with the effects of the highly viscous rye wort.\n\nThe modern version of Roggenbier is typically about 5% ABV and is fairly dark in colour. The flavour is grainy, often having a hearty flavour similar to pumpernickel bread. Typically, at least 50 percent of the malts used to make the beer are made from rye.\n\nTo date very few German breweries produce Roggenbier.\n\n"}

They rebelled against the flat-chested designs of the time and instead produced both dresses and support undergarments, particularly bras that accentuated the natural shape of a woman's figure, hence the name \"Maidenform\".\n\nThe company was founded in Bayonne, New Jersey. After going through a long restructuring effort at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s, Maidenform became a publicly traded company in July, 2005. Maidenform became a top leading shapewear brand taking over 40% of market share. This is #1 shapewear brand among other shapewear brands in America. Now Maidenform has about 8,000 stores in the US including Macy's and JCP Penney. Also, it has more than 75 stores all over the world. For example, Debenhams and House of Fraser in Europe and Sogo, Takashimaya in Asia. Sold to Hanesbrands in 2013.\n\n“When Maidenform converted factories to assist the U.S. military during World War II, the bra brand manufactured two things: parachutes and pigeon bras. Or, as they are known in polite society, pigeon vests, made out of bra-like materials and designed for paratroopers to strap to their chests. (Seen above, or on a paratrooper here.) After landing in a war zone, the paratrooper would undo his pigeon's bra, load the bird with a message, and send it back to home base.”\n\nAn imaginary situation of a partially undressed dream was exploited in Maidenform's advertising in the 1950s and 1960s - \"\"I dreamed I...\"[doing some ordinary activity]\"... in my Maidenform bra.\"\", with an illustration of the person wearing only underwear in a public place, appearing proud and cheerful. This campaign was referenced in a season 2 episode of \"Mad Men\", in which competitor Playtex, who (fictionally) has an account with the Sterling Cooper ad agency, asks Sterling Cooper to change their older-style ads to one more similar to Maidenform's.\n\nIn reality, this very successful advertising campaign was originated by Harry Trenner and his wife Florence Shapiro Trenner. Harry Trenner was, at that time, working for the William Weintrob Advertising Agency in New York City, and Maidenform was one of his accounts. They both would tell the story that they were sitting around the kitchen table after dinner in their home in the Wykagyl Park section of New Rochelle, New York. They hit on the idea for the ad and Harry took it to the agency which expanded it and showed it to Maidenform.\n\nIn October 2007, the company's headquarters moved to a new location in Iselin, New Jersey. \nIn November 2009, real estate developer Doug Stern acquired the property and with partner CSR Group, began the redevelopment of the former Maidenform Factory into SilkLofts, a residential building comprising 85 luxury loft rental apartments, including six artist's lofts. In 2010, the site was approved as a historic preservation project by the National Park Service. The conversion consists of restoring and incorporating existing brick and heavy timbers made of long leaf yellow pine into the new residential spaces, restoring and opening up original brick archways to bring the building back to its historical look, and reusing brick and wood salvaged during construction to build walls and floors. Designed to achieve LEED Silver certification (Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design) from the U.S. Green Building Council, SilkLofts includes environmentally-conscious elements such as Bamboo flooring, new Argon gas-filled factory windows, energy-efficient appliances, and Quartz countertops made from recycled materials. Most of the conversion was completed by early 2014, with the first residents expected to move in May, 2014.\n\n"}

Angry white men are characterized as having animosity toward young people, women or minorities. Donald Trump supporters have been described by some political commentators and liberal-leaning media companies as angry white men.\n\nThe rhetoric of the angry white man is not limited to the United States. It appeared during Australia's 1998 federal elections. New political parties appeared in that election due to the preexisting fathers' rights movement in Australia. These included the Abolish Family Support/Family Court Party and the Family Law Reform Party. Similar to the usage of the term in the United States, the Australian men categorized as angry white men opposed what they perceived as the feminist agenda. These political parties were created as a reaction to the historic number of women elected to the House of Representatives. Members of these groups claimed that \"feminists have entrenched themselves in positions of power and influence in government and are using their power to victimise men\".\n\nThe Liberal Party (major centre-right) senator Eric Abetz, arguing against Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, says it's \"passing strange\" that the Australian Human Rights Commission does not seem to care about what he perceives as \"racist terminology\" such as angry white man but it does care if another color is used to describe someone: \"One cannot help but think that the term 'white' can only refer to skin colour and therefore [you] are making reference to a skin colour [and] one assumes it must have been on the basis of race that the comment was made\".\n\nThe term is applied to those believed to be opposed to the Civil Rights Movement and second-wave feminism.\n\nThe movies \"Joe\", \"Falling Down\", \"God Bless America\", \"Joker\", and Clint Eastwood's performance in \"Gran Torino\" has been described as an exploration of the angry white man. In particular, the protagonist of \"Falling Down\" (a divorced, laid-off defense worker who descends via chance and choice into a spiral of increasing rage and violence) was widely reported upon as a representative of the stereotype.\n\nThe character Archie Bunker from the TV sitcoms \"All in the Family\" and \"Archie Bunker's Place\" \"turned the angry white male into a cultural icon\", according to CBS News. Walter White in the television series \"Breaking Bad\" has also been described as an \"angry white male\".\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

He is best known for his time in Mexico's Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre where he held their world heavyweight title and is also known for his appearances with the American professional wrestling promotion World Championship Wrestling from 1997 to 2001. He currently works for WWE as a trainer for NXT. Championships held by Smiley over the course of his career include the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship and the WCW Hardcore Championship.\n\nSmiley was born in Northampton, England in the United Kingdom. In the early 1970s, his parents divorced and Smiley and his mother emigrated to Miami, Florida in the United States. Smiley attended Miami Beach Senior High School, where he took part in amateur wrestling and powerlifting. He graduated in 1984.\n\nNorman Smiley trained under Boris Malenko and Dean Malenko before making his debut in 1985 on the Floridian independent circuit. He was originally known as \"Black Magic\", then as the hated \"Lord Henry Norman\". Smiley wrestled in Japanese shoot-style group the Universal Wrestling Federation in 1988 and 1989. In 1990 Smiley competed at the World Championship Wrestling Starrcade 1990 event teaming with Chris Adams against the team of Konnan and Rey Misterio, Sr.\n\nIn 1991, he began wrestling for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre in Mexico as \"Black Magic\", winning the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship and holding it until losing to Brazo de Plata in 1993.\n\nIn 1995 and 1996, he briefly competed in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion.\n\nSmiley signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1997, making his debut on the October 13, 1997 episode of \"WCW Monday Nitro\", defeating La Parka in a dark match. Smiley made his televised debut at the World War 3 pay-per-view, competing in the titular battle royal; however the match was won by Scott Hall. After being removed from television, he returned on the February 8, 1998 episode of \"Nitro\", with a new gimmick, which saw him perform his signature dance move, the \"Big Wiggle\". However, in his return match, he would be defeated by Konnan. On the June 8 episode of \"Nitro\", Smiley faced Fit Finlay for the WCW Television Championship, but failed to win the championship. At Fall Brawl, Smiley faced Ernest Miller in a losing effort.\n\nSmiley turned heel began in a backstage interview on the December 19 episode of \"Saturday Night\", where he mocked the fans for saying his name incorrectly. At Starrcade, he defeated Prince Iaukea. He then feuded with Chavo Guerrero, Jr., on one occasion destroying Guerrero's hobby horse mascot, Pepè, by feeding it into a wood chipper on the January 11, 1999 episode of \"Nitro\". At Souled Out on January 17, Smiley defeated Guerrero. In late 1999, Smiley entered the hardcore division. He would enter into a tournament to determine the inaugural WCW Hardcore Champion, which he won by defeating Brian Knobs in a tournament final at Mayhem on November 21. During his run with the championship, he would adopt the nickname 'Screamin', due to constantly screeching in a high-pitched tone during his matches, because of his fear of weapons. He would also often wear protective sports equipment as he entered the ring, usually also in the uniform of a local pro or collegiate sports team to gain a cheap pop. He lost the Hardcore Championship to Brian Knobs on the January 12, 2000 episode of \"Thunder\", which he failed to regain at Souled Out in a fatal four-way match also involving Fit Finlay and Meng.\n\nSmiley feuded with Brian Knobs, Meng and Terry Funk during his tenures as WCW Hardcore Champion, recruiting Chris Jericho's former associate Ralphus to be his manager. With the assistance of Ralphus, he stole a backyard wrestling championship from a group of children during a vignette.\n\nSmiley remained in WCW until the company was sold to the World Wrestling Federation in March 2001. He was not hired by the WWF following the sale.\n\nSmiley wrestled for the short-lived X Wrestling Federation and the World Wrestling All-Stars before returning to the independent circuit.\n\nHe wrestled briefly for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in 2002 and then had several tryout matches with WWE in 2003 and 2004. In February 2006, he was backstage during the TNA pay-per-view Against All Odds 2006, and he wrestled in an eight-man opening match on an episode of \"TNA Impact!\" shortly thereafter, doing the Big Wiggle on Jeff Jarrett. At TNA Destination X 2006, Smiley and Shark Boy lost to David Young and Elix Skipper. on the March 18 episode of Impact, Smiley and Shark Boy defeated The Latin American Xchange (Homicide and Machete). on the April 8 episode of Impact, Smiley and Shark Boy competed against Elix Skipper and David Young with the match ending in a no contest when Jeff Jarrett's Army (Jeff Jarrett, Scott Steiner, and America's Most Wanted) attacked all four men and Smiley was inactive for several weeks following an attack at the hands of Scott Steiner, but returned on the June 29 episode of \"Impact!\", losing to Monty Brown. on the July 13 episode of Impact, Smiley lost to Abyss. on the September 7 episode of Impact, Smiley, Shark Boy and The James Gang lost to America's Most Wanted, Matt Bentley and Kazarian. on the October 5 episode of Impact, Smiley competed in a fatal five way match which was won by Shark Boy. on the October 19 episode of Impact, Smiley lost to Christian Cage in a street fight. At Bound for Glory, Smiley competed in Open Invitational X Division Gauntlet battle royal which was won by Austin Starr. On the February 16, 2007 episode of \"Impact!\" Smiley made his return, teaming with Shark Boy in a loss to The Latin American Xchange (Homicide and Machete) this tag team match would turn out to be Smiley's final match with TNA.\n\nIn 2007, Smiley relocated to Orlando to work as a trainer for WWE's then development territory, Florida Championship Wrestling. In early 2010, he started making on-camera appearances as the lieutenant general manager of FCW and later in August of that year he was known on FCW TV as the liaison for the FCW president, Steve Keirn.\n\nSince its inception as a developmental territory, Smiley has continued to work as a trainer for WWE in NXT.\n\n\n"}

The ship drew worldwide attention in 1988 for transporting the mine-damaged from Dubai to Newport, Rhode Island. \n\nThe ship was built in 1983 by Oshima Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. in Ōshima, Japan, for Dutch shipping firm Wijsmuller Transport, which merged in 1993 with Dock Express Shipping to become Breda-based offshore heavy lifting group Dockwise Shipping B.V. The vessel capsized in 1999 and was scrapped in 2000.\n\n\"Mighty Servant 2\" was capable of carrying the heaviest semi-submersible drilling units, harsh-environment deep-water jack-up rigs and large floating production tension-leg platforms, semi-submersibles and spars with drafts of up to 14 metres. Most of the ship's cargoes were oil platforms and related gear. When loading its mammoth burdens, the ship took thousands of tons of water into ballast tanks, submerging its cargo deck underwater. The cargo would be floated into position, whereupon \"Mighty Servant 2\" would slowly pump out its ballast, lifting the deck up to sailing position.\n\nHer most famous job was the July 1988 haulage of the U.S. Navy's from Dubai to Newport, Rhode Island after the guided missile frigate struck a mine in the Persian Gulf on 14 April 1988. The 125-meter frigate barely fit on \"Mighty Servant 2\"'s cargo deck; holes had to be cut to accommodate the frigate's sonar dome and stabilizing fins. The loading, which was supervised by divers and underwater video monitors, took about 12 hours, with gaps measured in mere centimetres. About 20 of the frigate's 200-man crew remained aboard during the 8,100-mile, 30-day voyage. The USS \"Fahrion\" escorted the USS \"Samuel B. Roberts\" from Dubai through the Straits of Hormuz. The job received worldwide media coverage.\n\n\"Mighty Servant 2\" had two sister ships, \"Mighty Servant 1\", built in 1983, and \"Mighty Servant 3\", built in 1984. Both were built for Wijsmuller Transport.\n\nOn 6 December 2006, \"Mighty Servant 3\" sank in of water near the port of Luanda, Angola, while offloading the drilling platform \"Aleutian Key\". There were no casualties. In August 2009, Dockwise Shipping reported it had been returned to service.\n\n\"Mighty Servant 2\" capsized and sank on 2 November 1999 near the Indonesian island of Singkep (). The ship was en route from Singapore to Cabinda, Angola, bearing the North Nemba Topsides 8,790-ton offshore production module. The vessel tipped onto its side in of water in reportedly calm seas. A hydrographic survey of the area later discovered an unmarked single isolated pinnacle of granite directly on the ship's course. Five crew members died, including two Dutch and two Filipino men. \"Mighty Servant 2\" was declared a total loss. In 2000, the wreck was renamed T 2, transported to Alang, India, and scrapped.\n\n"}
{"id": "1934619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934619", "title": "Robert Haas (musicologist)", "text": "Robert Haas (musicologist)\n\nRobert Maria Haas (August 15, 1886, Prague – October 4, 1960, Vienna) was an Austrian musicologist.\n\nAt the beginning of his career with the Austrian national library, Haas was mostly interested in Baroque and Classical music. Later on, he was engaged by the newly formed International Bruckner Society to work on a complete edition of Anton Bruckner's symphonies and Masses based on the original manuscripts bequeathed by the composer to the Vienna library.\n\nHaas's editions of Bruckner are controversial. Writing for the Cambridge University Press, Benjamin Korstvedt charges that in the Second, Seventh and Eighth symphonies Haas made changes to Bruckner's musical texts that \"went beyond the limits of scholarly responsibility\".\n\nFor example, the Eighth Symphony existed in three versions: Bruckner's original manuscript of 1887, a revised manuscript of 1890 which incorporated suggestions from Franz Schalk, Arthur Nikisch and others, and the first published edition of 1892 which went even further in the direction of the changes, including significant cuts, suggested by Bruckner's friends. Haas decided to make a composite edition based on the 1890 manuscript but adding in some passages from the 1887 version he (justifiably, in the view of many Brucknerians, including conductors Rudolf Kempe and Georg Tintner) thought it a shame to lose: he also rewrote a brief passage himself. Haas thus produced a text of the symphony, however laudable on its own merits, that didn't happen to correspond to anything ever written or approved by Bruckner. Similar reworking occurs in Haas's edition of the Second Symphony. Some scholars have suggested that Haas was motivated to make these changes in order to assert copyright over his work.\n\nAnother source of controversy is Haas's unfortunate affiliation with the Nazi party, of which he was a member and didn't hesitate or scruple to use the language of Nazism to garner approval for his work. He portrayed Bruckner as being a pure and simple country soul who had been corrupted by \"cosmopolitan\" and Jewish influences. This proved Haas's undoing: after World War II, he was removed from the Bruckner project and replaced by the more scholarly, if less inventive, Leopold Nowak who went on to produce new editions of all Bruckner's symphonies, including use of the severely cut last (1892) version of the Eighth the composer was unfortunately persuaded to promulgate for publication.\n\nConductor Wilhelm Furtwängler criticized what he called Haas's \"violation myth\" in his private notebooks: \"Only unproductive minds can seriously believe that a great productive artist [i.e., Bruckner] can be 'put under pressure' for the duration of a depression. ... The falsification that is done here to the character of Bruckner - Bruckner as a fool - is much greater than [that done] by the essays [attempts?] of the first scholars, Loewe and Schalk.\"\n\nOn the other hand, conductor Georg Tintner, even as a Jewish victim of Nazi persecution, subsequently described Haas as \"brilliant\" and called Haas's edition of Bruckner's Eighth Symphony \"the best\" of all available versions although he himself chose to record the original 1887 version. Many other conductors of quite diverse ethnic backgrounds and persuasions, including Herbert von Karajan, Bernard Haitink, Daniel Barenboim, Takashi Asahina and Günter Wand continued to prefer Haas's editions, even after the Nowak editions became available.\n\nHaas also edited some of the music of Hugo Wolf, Claudio Monteverdi's \"Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria\", Christoph Willibald von Gluck's \"Don Juan\" ballet score, and other Baroque music. He also wrote about the Wiener Singspiel, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\n"}

{"id": "1934622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934622", "title": "Proximity search (text)", "text": "Proximity search (text)\n\nIn text processing, a proximity search looks for documents where two or more separately matching term occurrences are within a specified distance, where distance is the number of intermediate words or characters. In addition to proximity, some implementations may also impose a constraint on the word order, in that the order in the searched text must be identical to the order of the search query. Proximity searching goes beyond the simple matching of words by adding the constraint of proximity and is generally regarded as a form of advanced search.\n\nFor example, a search could be used to find \"red brick house\", and match phrases such as \"red house of brick\" or \"house made of red brick\". By limiting the proximity, these phrases can be matched while avoiding documents where the words are scattered or spread across a page or in unrelated articles in an anthology.\n\nThe basic linguistic assumption of proximity searching is that the proximity of the words in a document implies a relationship between the words. Given that authors of documents try to formulate sentences which contain a single idea, or cluster of related ideas within neighboring sentences or organized into paragraphs, there is an inherent, relatively high, probability within the document structure that words used together are related. On the other hand, when two words are on the opposite ends of a book, the probability of a relationship between the words is relatively weak. By limiting search results to only include matches where the words are within the specified maximum proximity, or distance, the search results are assumed to be of higher relevance than the matches where the words are scattered.\n\nCommercial internet search engines tend to produce too many matches (known as recall) for the average search query. Proximity searching is one method of reducing the number of pages matches, and to improve the relevance of the matched pages by using word proximity to assist in ranking. As an added benefit, proximity searching helps combat spamdexing by avoiding webpages which contain dictionary lists or shotgun lists of thousands of words, which would otherwise rank highly if the search engine was heavily biased toward word frequency.\n\nNote that a proximity search can designate that only some keywords must be within a specified distance. Proximity searching can be used with other search syntax and/or controls to allow more articulate search queries. Sometimes query operators like NEAR, NOT NEAR, FOLLOWED BY, NOT FOLLOWED BY, SENTENCE or FAR are used to indicate a proximity-search limit between specified keywords: for example, \"brick NEAR house\".\n\nIn regards to implicit/automatic versus explicit proximity search, as of November 2008, most Internet search engines only implement an implicit proximity search functionality. That is, they automatically rank those search results higher where the user keywords have a good \"overall proximity score\" in such results. If only two keywords are in the search query, this has no difference from an explicit proximity search which puts a NEAR operator between the two keywords. However, if three or more than three keywords are present, it is often important for the user to specify which subsets of these keywords expect a proximity in search results. This is useful if the user wants to do a prior art search (e.g. finding an existing approach to complete a specific task, finding a document that discloses a system that exhibits a procedural behavior collaboratively conducted by several components and links between these components).\n\nWeb search engines which support proximity search via an explicit proximity operator in their query language include Walhello, Exalead, Yandex, Yahoo!, Altavista, and Bing:\n\nOrdered search within the Google and Yahoo! search engines is possible using the asterisk (*) full-word wildcards: in Google this matches one or more words, and an in Yahoo! Search this matches exactly one word. (This is easily verified by searching for the following phrase in both Google and Yahoo!: \"addictive * of biblioscopy\".)\n\nTo emulate unordered search of the NEAR operator can be done using a combination of ordered searches. For example, to specify a close co-occurrence of \"house\" and \"dog\", the following search-expression could be specified: \"house dog\" OR \"dog house\" OR \"house * dog\" OR \"dog * house\" OR \"house * * dog\" OR \"dog * * house\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1934634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934634", "title": "International News Service v. Associated Press", "text": "International News Service v. Associated Press\n\nInternational News Service v. Associated Press, 248 U.S. 215 (1918), also known as INS v. AP or simply the \"INS\" case, is a 1918 decision of the United States Supreme Court that enunciated the misappropriation doctrine of federal intellectual property common law—that a \"quasi-property right\" may be created against others by one's investment of effort and money in an intangible thing, such as information or a design. The doctrine is highly controversial and criticized by many legal scholars, but it has its supporters.\n\nThe \"INS\" decision recognized the doctrine of U.S. copyright law that there is no copyright in facts, which the Supreme Court later greatly elaborated in the \"Feist\" case in 1991, but nonetheless \"INS\" extended the prior law of unfair competition to cover an additional type of interference with business expectations: \"misappropriation\" of the product of \"sweat of the brow.\" The case was decided during a period when a body of federal common law existed for business practices and torts, which the Supreme Court had power to declare or create, but two decades later the Supreme Court abolished that body of substantive law and held that state law must govern the field henceforth. Accordingly, the \"INS\" case no longer has precedential force, although state courts are free to follow its reasoning if they so choose.\n\nTwo competing United States news services (INS and AP) were in the business of reporting in the US on World War I. Their businesses hinged on getting fast and accurate reports published. Following reporting that the Allied Powers (Britain and France) perceived to be unduly favorable to the Central Powers (Germany and Austria) by William Randolph Hearst's INS, the Allies barred INS from using Allied telegraph lines to report news; that effectively shut down INS's war reporting.\n\nTo continue publishing news about the war, INS gained access to AP news through examination of AP news bulletin boards and early editions of newspapers affiliated with AP. INS members would rewrite the news and publish it as their own, without attribution to AP. Although INS newspapers had to wait for AP to post news before going to press, INS newspapers in the west had no such disadvantage relative to their AP counterparts. The AP brought an action seeking to enjoin INS from copying AP-gathered news.\n\nIn 1918, the federal courts and in particular the Supreme Court had the power to declare and create binding law in commercial matters, such as bills and notes and torts such as negligence and business interference. This was under the doctrine of \"Swift v. Tyson\", 41 U.S. 1 (1842), which had held that the federal courts, when deciding matters not specifically addressed by the state legislature, had the authority to develop a federal common law. In 1938, in \"Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins\", 304 U.S. 64 (1938), the Supreme Court overruled \"Swift v. Tyson\". As Justice Brandeis wrote:\n\nCongress has no power to declare substantive rules of common law applicable in a state whether they be local in their nature or \"general,\" be they commercial law or a part of the law of torts. And no clause in the Constitution purports to confer such a power upon the federal courts.\n\nBut because the \"INS\" case was decided in 1918, the Supreme Court could declare or create applicable tort law to govern the controversy between INS and AP.\n\nBefore the \"INS\" case, unfair competition was generally considered to be limited to cases of \"palming off\"—where the defendant deceived customers by causing them erroneously to believe that the defendant's product emanated from the plaintiff, and as a result diverted trade from the plaintiff to the defendant.\n\nThe Court held in favor of the AP, with Justice Pitney writing for the majority. Justices Holmes and Brandeis wrote dissents.\n\nThe majority opinion by Justice Pitney recognized that the information found in the AP news was not copyrightable as \"the information respecting current events contained in the literary production is not the creation of a writer but is a report of matters that ordinarily are \"publici juris\"; it is the history of the day.\" Instead, Pitney approached the issue from the perspective of unfair competition. He found that there was a quasi-property right in the news as it is \"stock in trade to be gathered at the cost of enterprise, organization, skill, labor and money, and to be distributed and sold to those who will pay money for it.\" Given the \"economic value\" of the news, a company can \"therefore\" have a limited property interest in it against a competitor (but not the general public) who would attempt to take advantage of the information.\n\nThe Court characterized INS's behavior as misappropriation. Due to the tenuous value of \"hot\" news, Pitney narrowed the period for which the proprietary right would apply: this doctrine \"postpones participation by complainant's competitor in the processes of distribution and reproduction of news that it has not gathered, and only to the extent necessary to prevent that competitor from reaping the fruits of complainant's efforts and expenditure.\"\n\nThe Court justified its creation of a \"quasi-property right\" in these terms:\n\n[INS] is taking material that has been acquired by AP as the result of organization and the expenditure of labor, skill, and money, and which is salable by AP for money, and that INS in appropriating it and selling it as its own is endeavoring to reap where it has not sown, and by disposing of it to newspapers that are competitors of AP's members is appropriating to itself the harvest of those who have sown.\n\nStripped of all disguises, the process amounts to an unauthorized interference with the normal operation of AP's legitimate business precisely at the point where the profit is to be reaped, in order to divert a material portion of the profit from those who have earned it to those who have not; with special advantage to INS in the competition because of the fact that it is not burdened with any part of the expense of gathering the news. The transaction speaks for itself and a court of equity ought not to hesitate long in characterizing it as unfair competition in business.\n\nThe underlying principle is much the same as that which lies at the base of the equitable theory of consideration in the law of trusts—that he who has fairly paid the price should have the beneficial use of the property. It is no answer to say that AP spends its money for that which is too fugitive or evanescent to be the subject of property. That might, and for the purposes of the discussion we are assuming that it would furnish an answer in a common-law controversy. But in a court of equity, where the question is one of unfair competition, if that which AP has acquired fairly at substantial cost may be sold fairly at substantial profit, a competitor who is misappropriating it for the purpose of disposing of it to his own profit and to the disadvantage of AP cannot be heard to say that it is too fugitive or evanescent to be regarded as property. It has all the attributes of property necessary for determining that a misappropriation of it by a competitor is unfair competition because contrary to good conscience.\n\nJustice Holmes began by challenging the Court's concept of property or \"quasi-property\" as the majority opinion terms it:\n\nProperty, a creation of law, does not arise from value, although exchangeable—a matter of fact. Many exchangeable values may be destroyed intentionally without compensation. Property depends upon exclusion by law from interference, and a person is not excluded from using any combination of words merely because some one has used it before, even if it took labor and genius to make it. If a given person is to be prohibited from making the use of words that his neighbors are free to make some other ground must be found.\n\nHolmes then turned to the law of unfair competition, which the majority claimed was the basis of the ruling. He said the law of unfair competition requires a misrepresentation. If the misrepresentation here is that some people may think AP copied the news from INS, the proper remedy would be only to prohibit INS (for a limited time) from copying from AP unless it provides a notice that it copied from AP.\n\nJustice Brandeis objected, first, to the creation of a new property right (even if called \"quasi-property\"): \"The knowledge for which protection is sought in the case at bar is not of a kind upon which the law has heretofore conferred the attributes of property; nor is the manner of its acquisition or use nor the purpose to which it is applied, such as has heretofore been recognized as entitling a plaintiff to relief.\"\n\nNext, he denied that \"reaping where another sowed\" is an actionable tort:\n\nTo appropriate and use for profit, knowledge and ideas produced by other men, without making compensation or even acknowledgment, may be inconsistent with a finer sense of propriety; but, with the exceptions indicated above [\"i.e.\", misrepresentation, physical or moral coercion, or by inducing breaches of contract], the law has heretofore sanctioned the practice. Thus it was held that one may ordinarily make and sell anything in any form, may copy with exactness that which another has produced, or may otherwise use his ideas without his consent and without the payment of compensation, and yet not inflict a legal injury; and that ordinarily one is at perfect liberty to find out, if he can by lawful means, trade secrets of another, however valuable, and then use the knowledge so acquired gainfully, although it cost the original owner much in effort and in money to collect or produce.\n\nHe objected to the majority's saying that \"INS cannot be heard to say\" such and such \"in a court of equity, where the question is one of unfair competition.\" He said there was no basis to invoke equity:\n\nBrandeis closed his dissent with an argument that the Court was ill-suited to act as a legislature and the matter should be left to the wisdom of Congress:\n\nAlthough a landmark case when it was decided, subsequent developments have diminished its significance. A leading copyright law scholar has commented:\n\nIt has been suggested that the credence due the \"International News Service\" case today is minimal: that subsequent decisions have restricted its doctrine to the news context and that, in any event, it is but a derelict of the federal common law, untenable after \"Erie R.R. v. Tompkins\".\n\nSeventh Circuit Judge Posner similarly remarked that \"INS\" is \"a decision no longer authoritative because it was based on the federal courts' subsequently abandoned authority to formulate common law principles in suits arising under state law though litigated in federal court.\"\n\nIn \"Twentieth Century Sporting Club, Inc. v. Transradio Press Service\", the court found misappropriation when a press service stationed \"spotters\" on rooftops who watched a boxing match in a nearby stadium; the defendant combined that information with information broadcast by plaintiff's exclusive licensee (NBC) to produce a simulated ringside, blow-by-blow broadcast of a boxing match.\n\nThe narrowest implication of \"INS\" was that there was now a \"hot news\" doctrine that protected first comers in their creation of an ephemeral, time-sensitive information asset at appreciable expense against \"free riders.\" Thus, in \"National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc. (NBA)\", the Second Circuit held that under New York State law, a \"hot-news\" \"INS\"-like claim exists in \"cases where: (i) a plaintiff generates or gathers information at a cost; (ii) the information is time-sensitive; (iii) a defendant's use of the information constitutes free riding on the plaintiff's efforts; (iv) the defendant is in direct competition with a product or service offered by the plaintiffs; and (v) the ability of other parties to free-ride on the efforts of the plaintiff or others would so reduce the incentive to produce the product or service that its existence or quality would be substantially threatened.\"\n\nBut after the passage of the 1976 Copyright Act, the hot news doctrine began to suffer reverses. The Second Circuit held that the \"hot news\" tort was largely preempted by the 1976 Act in the \"NBA\" case.\"\n\nPrior to 1972, federal copyright law did not extend to sound recordings. During this period, several states acted against \"record piracy\" (the copying of phonograph records or tape recordings) under the \"INS\" doctrine. In \"Goldstein v. California\", the Supreme Court held that the California penal statute against the unlicensed copying of records was not preempted by federal copyright law since Congress had not regulated the subject matter.\n\nIn \"John Roberts Mfg. Co. v. University of Notre Dame du Lac\", an\nunlicensed manufacturer distributed class rings in competition with the \"official\" product sponsored by the university. That in making his rings the copyist used the Notre Dame name, seal, and monogram without the university's consent, a misappropriation of property rights that the Seventh Circuit equated (without citing \"INS\") to the theft of cash from the university's safe deposit box.\n\nIn \"Flint v. Oleet Jewelry Mfg. Co.\", the defendant copied the plaintiff's unpatented, uncopyrighted \"Mustard Seed Remembrancer\" locket, containing a mustard seed to remind users of the power of \"so much faith as a grain of mustard\" to move mountains (\"Matt\". 17:20). The court found misappropriation under the \"INS\" doctrine, holding that secondary meaning was no longer an essential element of unfair competition law in New York.\n\nIn \"Metropolitan Opera Ass'n v. Wagner-Nichols Recorder Corp.\", the trial court described New York misappropriation law as standing for the \"broader principle that property rights of commercial value are to be and will be protected from any form of commercial immorality\"; that misappropriation law developed \"to deal with business malpractices offensive to the ethics of [] society\"; and that the doctrine is \"broad and flexible.\" In that case, the defendant engaged in a \"business malpractice offensive to the ethics of society\": it copied and recorded the Met's opera broadcasts, which interfered with the Met's exclusive recording contract with Columbia Records. (At the time, the Copyright Act did not yet extend to sound recordings.) This was not a \"hot news\" case but rather an improper copying case. It shows the expansion of the \"INS\" doctrine beyond \"hot news\" to a more general misappropriation doctrine.\n\nBut the Second Circuit subsequently held that New York law, so interpreted, was preempted by the 1976 Copyright Act. After quoting the foregoing language from \"Metropolitan Opera\", the Second Circuit said:\n\nHowever, we believe that \"Metropolitan Opera\" 's broad misappropriation doctrine based on amorphous concepts such as \"commercial immorality\" or society's \"ethics\" is preempted. Such concepts are virtually synonymous for wrongful copying and are in no meaningful fashion distinguishable from infringement of a copyright. The broad misappropriation doctrine relied upon by the district court is, therefore, the equivalent of exclusive rights in copyright law.\n\nAt the same time, other Second Circuit case law, beginning shortly after the \"INS\" decision, has greatly limited the application of \"INS\" to general product copying. In these cases, typically, the doctrine requiring \"secondary meaning\" is invoked to bar plaintiff's recovery.\n\nAn illustrative case is the 1929 decision in \"Cheney Bros. v. Doris Silk Corp.\", decided a decade after \"INS\". Many of the plaintiff's fabric designs (80%) were unsuccessful; plaintiff copied successful designs. The designs were not practicably copyrighted or patented, so that \"the plaintiff, which is put to much ingenuity and expense in fabricating them, finds itself without protection of any sort for its pains.\" Since the designs were short lived, plaintiff sought \"hot-news\" type of protection from equity, for less than a year. The Second Circuit, per Judge Learned Hand, denied relief: \"In the absence of some recognized right at common law, or under the statutes—and the plaintiff claims neither—a man's property is limited to the chattels which embody his invention. Others may imitate these at their pleasure.\" As for the \"INS\" case, on which the plaintiff sought to rely, the court refused to apply it beyond its particular fact pattern:\n\nAlthough that [case] concerned another subject-matter—printed news dispatches—we agree that, if it meant to lay down a general doctrine, it would cover this case; at least, the language of the majority opinion goes so far. We do not believe that it did. While it is of course true that law ordinarily speaks in general terms, there are cases where the occasion is at once the justification for, and the limit of, what is decided. This appears to us such an instance; we think that no more was covered than situations substantially similar to those then at bar. The difficulties of understanding it otherwise are insuperable. We are to suppose that the court meant to create a sort of common-law patent or copyright for reasons of justice. Either would flagrantly conflict with the scheme which Congress has for more than a century devised to cover the subject-matter.\n\nAnother illustrative case is the 1960 decision in \"American-Marietta Co. v. Krigsman\", involving a sponge-mop replacement (for installation after the original sponge becomes worn out). The plaintiff did not attempt to protect functional features of the product, but only sought to prevent the copying of the nonfunctional arrangement of slots in the metal \"presser plate\" (hinged to the bottom of the mop) which is pressed against the sponge to squeeze water out. The rule against nonfunctional copying, the Second Circuit held (in an opinion by Judge Learned Hand), is restricted to cases where the nonfunctional element has acquired a secondary meaning:\n\nIt is indeed quite likely that buyers have assumed an identity of origin to the two mops from their general similarity; it is even possible-though we should suppose it very unlikely-that the identical form of the \"slots\" may have contributed to that assumption, but one who seeks to enjoin the reproduction of what is in the public domain must affirmatively show that the copied features were the reason for the confusion; it is not enough that perhaps it may have contributed [to it].\n\nThe implication of this line of cases is that the \"INS\" doctrine is being given very limited scope, particularly in contexts in which copyright law may dominate the field. Decisions from other circuits are consistent with those from the Second Circuit.\n\nIn \"Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co.\", in 1938, the Supreme Court considered a case arguably akin to \"INS\" but (with Justice Brandeis writing for the Court and now in the majority) denied relief. The Court said:\n\nKellogg Company is undoubtedly sharing in the goodwill of the article known as \"Shredded Wheat\"; and thus is sharing in a market which was created by the skill and judgment of plaintiff's predecessor and has been widely extended by vast expenditures in advertising persistently made. But that is not unfair. Sharing in the goodwill of an article unprotected by patent or trade-mark is the exercise of a right possessed by all—and in the free exercise of which the consuming public is deeply interested.\n\nOne commentator maintained that one could properly—\n\n... view \"Kellogg\" as vindication of the views that he [Brandeis] expressed in \"INS\". That Nabisco had invested in the shredded wheat product did not give it control over the use of the pillow shape (or the term SHREDDED WHEAT); it had no property right against misappropriation of the shape after the expiry of the patents. Instead, Brandeis inquired [only] whether Kellogg had engaged in any acts of misrepresentation.\n\nThe 1964 decisions of the Supreme Court in \"Sears v. Stiffel\" and \"Compco v. Day-Brite\" undermined the application of the \"INS\" doctrine to prohibit or penalize the copying of product designs, to the point where the First Circuit said in 1967 that \"INS\" \"has clearly been overruled.\" Those cases held that federal patent law preempts state laws that duplicate the patent laws or disturb the balance that patent law sets between competition and monopoly protection for inventions; as one commentator explained:\n\nThe implement selected by the Court to vindicate the competition–monopoly balance may be characterized as a per se rule. Any state law which operates to jar the balance, however incidentally, is, per se, an illegitimate impediment and to be condemned. In the view of Mr. Justice Black, writing for the majority, just \"as a State cannot encroach upon the federal patent laws directly, it cannot, under some other law . . . give protection of a kind that clashes with the objectives of the federal patent laws.\" . . . Though \"International News Service\" has never been expressly overruled, the Court was, in \"Sears\" and \"Compco\", apparently rejecting its approach.\nAccordingly, such \"INS\"-based decisions as the Notre Dame ring case, the Flint mustard seed case, \"Haeger Potteries, Inc. v. Gilner Potteries\", in which the court held that copying an ash-tray design \"in precise detail as to design, shape and color, and in every other respect than quality, is nothing less than piracy,\" and \"Dior v. Milton\", in which the court held that there was no good reason \"why the rights of the plaintiff [in a dress design] should receive less protection than those of the sponsor of sporting events and the disseminator of news,\" can no longer survive: they have been given \"the death knell.\" It is said that—\n\n\"Stiffel\" and \"Compco\" now have made it clear that the misappropriation theory as applied to cases involving article duplication is to be rejected. . . . By applying the doctrine of preemption of the field by congressional enactment of federal patent and copyright laws, the Supreme Court has . . . rung the death knell for the misappropriation theory as applied to product simulation.\n\n\n\n"}

Par.) is a Greek chronology, covering the years from 1582 BC to 299 BC, inscribed on a stele. Found on the island of Paros in two sections, and sold in Smyrna in the early 17th century to an agent for Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, this inscription was deciphered by John Selden and published among the Arundel Marbles, \"Marmora Arundelliana\" (London 1628-9) nos. 1–14, 59–119. The first of the sections published by Selden has subsequently disappeared. A further third fragment of this inscription, comprising the base of the stele and containing the end of the text, was found on Paros in 1897. It has entries from 336/35 to 299/98 BC.\n\nThe two known upper fragments, brought to London in 1627 and presented to Oxford University in 1667, include entries for the years 1582/81–355/54 BC. The surviving upper chronicle fragment currently resides in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. It combines dates for events which modern readers would consider mythic, such as the Flood of Deucalion (equivalent to 1529/28 BC) with dates we would categorize as historic. For the Greeks, the events of their distant past, such as the Trojan War (dated from 1217 to 1208 BC in the Parian inscription) and the Voyage of the Argonauts were \"historic\": their myths were understood as legends to the Greeks. In fact the Parian inscriptions spend more detail on the Heroic Age than on certifiably historic events closer to the date the stele was inscribed and erected, apparently during 264/263 BC. \"The Parian Marble uses chronological specificity as a guarantee of truth,\" Peter Green observed in the introduction to his annotated translation of the \"Argonautica\" of Apollonios Rhodios: \"the mythic past was rooted in historical time, its legends treated as fact, its heroic protagonists seen as links between the 'age of origins' and the mortal, everyday world that succeeded it.\"\n\nThe shorter fragment base of the stele, found in 1897, is in the Archaeological Museum of Paros. It contains chronicle entries for the years 336/35–299/98 BC.\n\nThe major analysis of the \"Parian Chronicle\" is that of Felix Jacoby, written in the early 20th century. This appeared in two works: his book \"Das Marmor Parium\" published in 1904, and as a part of the \"Fragmente der griechischen Historiker\", first published in 1929. There has been no major study devoted to the entire stele since that time, although a few authors have dealt with specific time periods covered in the tablet. Furthermore, there apparently have been no critical studies of the original text on the stele itself since the work of Jacoby, as evidenced by the fact that the display of the Greek text on the Ashmolean Web site is a photocopy of the text that Jacoby published in his \"Fragmente\".\n\nIn attempting to discern the source or sources of the \"Chronicle\", Jacoby followed the rather subjective method that was popular in the late 19th and early 20th century, whereby a change in the subject matter or style of writing was taken to imply a different source. The style of the \"Chronicle\", however, is quite uniform. Events are listed with little embellishment, and the primary purpose seems to be to give for each event the name of the king or archon ruling in Athens at the time, along with the number of years prior to the base date of the tablet (264/63 BC). The only exceptions are that in nine out of the 107 extant entries, the name of the archon or king is no longer readable, and in 14 entries the number of elapsed years is similarly effaced. The lack of embellishment is shown, for example, in the entry for Cecrops, which attributes nothing remarkable to him or to his reign, even though in later Greek mythology he was a semi-human creature. The \"Chronicle’s\" entries for Deucalion, who became the center of many flood-myths, are more consistent with the earliest Greek legends that merely state that he fled from a flooding river in his native Lycoreia near the Gulf of Corinth, arriving at Athens where his son later became king.\n\nIn contrast to Jacoby's ideas, a 2012 study maintains that the style of the \"Chronicle’s\" entries suggests that the ultimate source of the information in the \"Parian Chronicle\" was the archives of the city of Athens. Authors Rodger Young and Andrew Steinmann base their views on three key inferences from the available evidence. 1) The naming of the reigning king or archon in Athens for each entry is consistent with an Athenian provenance of the material. 2) The source behind each entry must have provided a year-number from which the author of the \"Parian Chronicle\" was able to calculate the years to his own time, thus suggesting that the archives from which the information was taken were keeping track of the years since the founding of the kingship in Athens under Cecrops. Such framing chronicles are known to have been kept in Rome: the \"Anno Urbis Conditae,\" from which events were reckoned. 3) The annalistic style of the \"Chronicle\" is in keeping with the genre of annalistic records such as the Assyrian Eponym Canon, in which the purpose was not so much to describe events as to give an accurate record of when the events occurred, as related to the years since the founding of the kingship and also tying the event to the king or archon who was currently reigning.\n\nYoung and Steinmann acknowledge several factors that make it less plausible the source behind the \"Parian Chronicle\" was the state archives of Athens. The first is that there are no known examples of writing from Athens that date as early as 1582/81 BC, the date of the \"Chronicle’s\" first entry. The earliest extant writing in Greek from any area is found in the syllabic Linear B script, for which the earliest instances date to about a century and a half after the reputed beginning of the kingship under Cecrops. Another argument against the Athenian provenance of the information in the \"Parian Chronicle\" is the reconstruction given by Jacoby of the first two lines of the tablet, which were largely effaced when Selden made his copy (this top part has since been lost), but of which enough remained that Selden could determine that it was intended as a statement of the source of the tablet's histories. Jacoby's restoration of Selden's Greek text is followed on the Ashmolean Web site, which translates it into English as follows, with square brackets and italics indicating the portion of the text that is conjectural:\n[\"From\"] al[\"l the records and general accounts\"] I have recorded [\"the previous times\"], beginning from Cecrops becoming first king of Athens, until [____]uanax was archon in Paros, and Diognetus in Athens.\nThe critical word here is “general,” which represents a Greek original for which Selden could read only the last three letters, νῶν; these are the ending of the genitive plural. Jacoby hypothesized the word was an adjective and restored it to κοινῶν, meaning “common, general, ordinary”. This is consistent with Jacoby's theory for the source of the \"Chronicle’s\" documents, namely that the author used a variety of selections from diverse materials available in the third century BC. The Ashmolean Web site then translated this into English as shown above. Young and Steinmann, however, maintain that “The writer of an annalistic history that professes to give exact dates for events would not assure readers of his credibility by saying that his information was derived from the “common” folklore ... For the Parian Marble, such reassurance would be given if the original word, for which the genitive plural ending - νῶν has survived, was not κοινῶν, but Ἀθηνῶν,” i.e. “of Athens,” taking the word as a noun (Athens was a plural noun in classical Greek). This restoration would give the reader the assurance that the writer of the tablet had an authoritative source for his information, as follows:\n[\"From\"] al[\"l the public records and histories of Ath\"]ens I have recorded [\"the previous times\"], beginning from Cecrops becoming first king of Athens, until [____]uanax was archon in Paros, and Diognetus in Athens.\nOne other conjecture for the source of the \"Parian Chronicle’s\" information is of historical interest. In 1788, Joseph Robertson went to considerable length in arguing that the tablets were of relatively recent date and entirely fraudulent. His book is accessible under the External links below. The finding of the bottom portion of the tablet on Páros in 1897 has made Robertson's theory untenable.\n\nIn 2013, Ben Altshuler of the Institute for Digital Archaeology oversaw reflectance transformation imaging (RTI) of the Parian Marble, revealing significant, previously illegible text. RTI scans are also available as part of the Digital Marmor Parium project.\n\n\n"}

It broadcasts classical music and news on five stations in the northwestern Lower Peninsula. It is operated by the Interlochen Center for the Arts, with studios on the center's campus in Interlochen, Michigan; just outside Traverse City. It carries programming from NPR and Public Radio International.\n\nAt one point early in the 2000s, IPR led the nation in annual listener support. This was all the more remarkable because it is the second-smallest NPR member in Michigan, and one of the smallest in the entire NPR system.\n\nJoseph E. Maddy, founder of the National Music Camp (now the Interlochen Center for the Arts), had long wanted to bring a fine arts radio station to Northern Michigan. In 1963, WIAA signed on for the first time. Originally broadcasting eight hours per day, it grew enough within a decade to become a charter member of NPR. Interlochen Public Radio became a network in 1989 with the addition of WICV. Interlochen bought contemporary Christian station WDQV in 2005 and converted it into a third satellite for the eastern portion of the market, WIAB.\n\nIn 2000, Interlochen signed on WICA at 91.5, and by 2001 all NPR news and talk programming moved there from WIAA/WICV. However, WICA does not have nearly the signal strength of WIAA. As a result, Cadillac, the second-largest city in IPR's service area, does not have a clear signal for NPR talk programming; WICA's signal in Cadillac is marginal at best. This is true even after the addition of two repeaters for WICA since the turn of the millennium.\n\nIn 2018, Interlochen sold WICV to Northern Christian Radio for $150,000, and the station adopted a Christian format as an affiliate of The Promise FM.\n\nSince 2000, IPR has operated a two-service network. \"Classical IPR\" (formerly known as \"IPR Music Radio\") provides classical music and hourly NPR news updates for three stations.

LeSueur (died 1938) and Anna Bell Johnson (died 1958). His older sister was Daisy LeSueur and his younger sister was Lucille Fay LeSueur, later the Oscar-winning film star Joan Crawford. After Thomas LeSueur had abandoned the family, Anna wed businessman Henry J. Cassin (1868–1922). The family lived in Lawton, Oklahoma, then moved to Kansas City, Missouri, in 1917. Hal LeSueur moved from Kansas City around 1928 to Los Angeles. He found work in the stock department at MGM in bit parts or as an extra.\n\nHe was married twice. His first wife was Jessie Burress (July 17, 1904– December 2, 1977). They wed on October 21, 1922 in Kansas City, Missouri (age given as 21) and divorced in 1929. His second wife was Kasha Haroldi (March 31, 1907 – June 26, 1992). Hal and Kasha married in Santa Ana, California on September 16, 1931, with Hal's age given as 30.. They had one child, a daughter, named Joan Crawford LeSueur (December 2, 1933 – December 15, 1999), who was named after Hal's sister and became a dancer on Broadway, known professionally as Joan Lowe. Kasha and Hal LeSueur divorced in 1935. She won custody of their daughter. She remarried and became Mrs. Kasha Lowe; her daughter became Joan Lowe, the name by which she was known professionally, later Mrs. Joan Fowler.\n\nOn November 9, 1935, LeSueur was in a head-on collision at the top of Cahuenga Pass. The other car caught fire and the three people inside, Earl Gose, who was driving, his wife, Golda, and his unmarried sister, Grace, were pulled from the blaze. Their car burned to a charred hulk. LeSueur suffered severe cuts and bruises on his hands, face, arms and legs. The other people were also seriously injured. All were taken to a hospital in Hollywood. The injuries of Grace Gose proved fatal three days later. His mother, Anna, and his ex-wife, Kasha, accompanied him to the coroner's inquest on November 15. Earl and Golda Gose were unable to appear. LeSueur testified that he was driving near the center of the highway when the other car suddenly pulled out from behind another car into his lane and he was unable to avoid the collision. The Coroner's jury exonerated him of blame for the crash, returning a verdict of accidental death.\n\nIn February 1936, Earl and Golda Gose sued him, seeking $86,400 in damages. Golda, who was taken into court on a hospital stretcher, which was placed before the jury box, testified that LeSueur was driving on the wrong side of Cahuenga Boulevard when his car collided with theirs. LeSueur not only denied responsibility for the accident, but in his cross-complaint for $10,000 charged that the crash came about through Gose's negligent driving. The suit was then abruptly dropped, however, when a settlement was reached. LeSueur agreed to pay them $8,500, one tenth of what they had originally sought.\n\nTired of being an uncredited actor in the films on which he worked, he decided to try his hand at make-up work at MGM for a while. When he left that job, he worked as a sporting goods salesman. LeSueur made one final movie appearance, playing a reporter in \"Jeanne Eagels\" (1957), the only role for which LeSueur received screen credit. He made one TV appearance in an episode of the series \"State Trooper\", titled \"No Fancy Cowboys\", which aired on March 13, 1957. When he left the sporting goods business, LeSueur began working as a desk clerk at a Los Angeles hotel, and supplemented his income working as a switchboard operator at the motel where he lived.\n\nHal LeSueur died of a ruptured appendix at General Hospital. He was interred in Forest Lawn Cemetery, Glendale, California. He was originally believed to have been 59 years old, but may have been 61.

He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling from 1999 to 2001, where he held the WCW Hardcore Championship.\n\nPrior to professional wrestling, Cornell was an amateur wrestler throughout high school before becoming a professional kickboxer.\n\nAfter completing his training at World Championship Wrestling's Power Plant wrestling school in 1999, Cornell made his WCW television debut On the October 26 edition of \"WorldWide\" under his real name in a losing effort to Kid Romeo.\n\nOn the August 16 edition of \"Thunder\", Reno helped form The Natural Born Thrillers with Chuck Palumbo, Shawn Stasiak, Sean O'Haire, Mark Jindrak and Mike Sanders by attackingThe Filthy Animals. Upon joining the Thrillers, Reno's character was expanded to a shootfighting martial artist who fought in Las Vegas's \"underground fighting leagues\" complete with a queue ponytail, all of which was based on his legitimate training as a kickboxer.\n\nThe Thrillers soon became the new enforcers for Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff by replacing their original enforcers, the Filthy Animals. Soon afterwards, the Thrillers and the Animals began feuding with each other. The tension between the two teams quickly grew as the Thrillers attacked their former trainer, Paul Orndorff, who was subsequently saved by the Animals. At Fall Brawl, the Thrillers and the Animals faced off in an elimination match. The Thrillers eliminated all but two members of the Animals, with the match ending in a no-contest after Orndoff legitimately injured himself after botching his signature piledriver. The following night on \"Nitro\", the Thrillers wrestled against the two survivors from their elimination match, Rey Misterio Jr. and Tygress, but lost.\n\nAfter this, the Thrillers began chasing the World Tag Team Championship while Reno took a more reserved role. On October 2, 2000, Reno began pursuing the Hardcore Championship, losing to Sgt. AWOL in a tournament final for the belt. Fellow Thriller member Mike Sanders, who was WCW's Commissioner at the time, reversed the decision, however, and gave the win and the title to Reno instead. He then defeated AWOL at Halloween Havoc to retain the title.\n\nOn November 8, Reno lost the belt to Crowbar. He soon began a brief feud with both Crowbar and former Hardcore Champion Big Vito, with all three men competing for the title at Mayhem. At the event, Crowbar pinned Reno after hitting him with a chair to retain the title.\n\nReno then began feuding solely with Vito, which was intensified when it was revealed that Reno was, in storyline, dating Vito's sister. It was also revealed that Reno and Vito were, in storyline, brothers. Both men subsequently became allies on the December 4 edition of \"Nitro\" when Vito saved Reno from being attacked by KroniK. They formed a tag team soon after, but the team came to an end quickly at Starrcade when Reno turned on Vito during their match with KroniK. He then revealed that he was the one who paid off KroniK to attack him in the previous weeks. Their feud culminated at Sin, which saw Reno pin Vito.\n\nReno continued his alliance with Mike Sanders and working with the Natural Born Thrillers until the group's dissolution in February 2001, after Johnny The Bull reformed The Mamalukes with Big Vito and members Shawn Stasiak and Mark Jindrak began feuding with Sean O'Haire and Chuck Palumbo over the World Tag Team Title.\n\nReno wrestled his last match in WCW on the March 14, 2001 edition of \"Thunder\", where he was defeated by former Natural Born Thrillers partner Shawn Stasiak. In late March 2001, the World Wrestling Federation bought out WCW. Cornell's contract was among those acquired in the buyout.\n\nCornell was signed to a developmental deal with the World Wrestling Federation after wrestling a dark match before the August 6 episode of \"Raw Is War\", defeating Mike Sanders despite both being members of The Alliance. From there, he was sent to the Heartland Wrestling Association for more training, where he was a member of Team WCW along with fellow WCW alumni Sanders, Johnny The Bull, Mark Jindrak, Jason Jett, Lash LeRoux, Shannon Moore, Evan Karagias, Kwee Wee, Elix Skipper, and Jamie Knoble before he was released from his developmental contract on December 5, 2001.\n\nUpon being released, Cornell began wrestling for the Australia-based World Wrestling All-Stars under his Reno ring name, where he competed against a number of fellow WCW alumni. He remained with the promotion until its closure in 2003, and subsequently retired from wrestling soon after.\n\n"}

{"id": "1934682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934682", "title": "Ahmad Shah Bahadur", "text": "Ahmad Shah Bahadur\n\nAhmad Shah Bahadur (), also known as Mirza Ahmad Shah () or Mujahid-ud-Din Ahmad Shah Ghazi () (23 December 1725 – 1 January 1775) was born to Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah. He succeeded his father to the throne as the 13th Mughal Emperor in 1748 at the age of 22. When Ahmed Shah Bahadur came to power, the Mughal Empire was collapsing. Furthermore, his administrative weaknesses eventually led to the rise of the usurping Feroze Jung III.\n\nAhmed Shah Bahadur inherited a much weakened Mughal state. He was emperor in title for\nsix years, but left all affairs of state to rivalling factions. He was deposed by the Vizier Feroze Jung III and later blinded along with his mother. He spent the remaining years of his life in prison and died of natural causes in January 1775.\n\nPrince Ahmad was born in 1725 to the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah and his consort Qudsia Begum. Decentralization during his father's reign, the Maratha Wars and the blow from Nadir Shah's invasion had initiated the decline of the Mughal Empire.\n\nAs a young Prince Ahmad developed a weakness for women, though this was restricted under his father's supervision. He is also known to have been an illiterate and never took part in military training, largely due to the attitude of his miserly father, who stinted him and used to browbeat him, never even giving him a sufficient allowance requisite of imperial princes, despite the fact that at that time there was still no shortage of funds for the imperial household. He was strongly supported by his step-mother, Badshah Begum, who adopted him as her own son, after the loss of her biological child; this was instrumental in his succession to the throne; as well as by his mother, who managed the state affairs along with the Head Eunuch of the \"harem\", Javed Khan \"Nawab Bahadur\", during his reign, since he sought the harem more than his duties to the empire.\n\nAfter the death of the Mughal viceroy of Lahore, Zakariya Khan Bahadur, his two sons, Yahya Khan Bahadur and Mian Shah Nawaz Khan, the Emir of Multan, fought each other during for succession. After defeating his elder brother Mian Shah Nawaz Khan declared himself the Mughal viceroy of Punjab. This weakness was quickly exploited by Ahmad Shah Durrani who initiated another campaign with 30,000 cavalry to assist Shah Nawaz Khan, who was resented for tax-evasion in the Mughal imperial court and opposed by the Grand Vizier, Qamaruddin Khan, who was the father-in-law of Yahya Khan.\n\nIn April 1748, Ahmad Shah Abdali joined by Shah Nawaz Khan invaded the Indus River Valley, prompting Muradyab Khan Kalhoro the Subedar of Sindh to dispatch reinforcements to assist the Mughal Army along the river banks. Prince Ahmad and Qamaruddin Khan, Hafiz Rahmat Khan, Safdarjung, Intizam-ud-Daula, Nasir Khan the former Subedar of Ghazni and Kabul, Yahya Khan and Ali Muhammad Khan Rohilla were dispatched by Muhammad Shah to command a large army of 75,000 to confront the 12,000 advancing Durrani's. During the Battle of Manipur (1748), in Sirhind by the river Sutlej both forces fought a decisive battle and Prince Ahmad was nominally victorious, he was thereupon conferred with the title Bahadur, after a Durrani wagon filled with gunpowder exploded. However, the Muhammad Shah seriously mourned the fall of Qamaruddin Khan, who was killed by a stray artillery shell during the battle. After Ahmad Shah Durrani's retreat the Mughal aligned Khanate of Kalat, Nawab Amir of Bhawalpur remained aligned to Alamgir II. Only before the prelude to the Third Battle of Panipat became subjects of the Durrani Empire.\n\nHowever, Qamaruddin Khan's son Muin ul-Mulk also a recognised war hero from the Battle of Manipur, was placed as the Mughal viceroy of Punjab, by the new Mughal Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur.\n\nThe Battle of Manipur had a considerable impact on the tactical prowess of Ahmad Shah Bahadur. When he became emperor, he is known to have introduced and organised the \"Purbiya\" camel corps particularly in the years 1754-51 to combat the invading Durranis and the rebellious Sikhs in the North-West regions of his empire.\n\nQamaruddin Khan died during the Sirhind conflict. This news led to Muhammad Shah becoming gravely sick and he died soon afterwards. Prince Ahmad ascended the throne on 18 April 1748 and on 29 April 1748 his coronation was held at Red Fort in Delhi. He assumed the title \"Abu Nasir Mujahid-ud-Din Ahmad Shah Ghazi\".\n\nThe new emperor now began to enjoy his life with women in his harem.\n\nHe appointed Safdarjung, the Nawab of Oudh, as Grand Vizier, Feroze Jung III as Mir Bakshi, and Muin ul-Mulk, the son of Qamaruddin Khan, as the governor of Punjab\n\nThe main servant of the Mughal court, Javed Khan, was given the official title of \"Nawab Bahadur\" and an army of 5000. Together with the emperor's mother, who was given a force of 50,000, Javed Khan became effective regent. Javed Khan's rise to power and his authority was seen as an affront to the nobility and the aristocracy of the empire, and in particular to the emperor's soldiers.\n\nQudsia Begum made every effort to protect the high authority that was granted to Javed Khan and authorised him to use force against those who opposed and resented both him and her. After Safdarjung survived an assassination attempt in 1749 (plotted by Javed Khan), due to his response tensions erupted in the Mughal court when he tried to de-legitimise any relatives of his predeceasing Grand Viziers he also tried to drive out all the members of the imperial Afghan faction from positions of authority due to the stipends they received from the eunuch. These policies brought Safdarjung in conflict with the principal members of the Turani Faction and particularly Javed Khan.\n\nIn 1750, Javed Khan arrested the Mughal commander Salabat Khan, who had demanded pay for his 18,000 troops who had been recalled to Delhi after completing the assigned expedition against Marwar. While imprisoned, Salabat Khan sold all his property to pay his troops in order to halt a possible revolt and thenceforth lived in poverty like a Dervish.\n\nAngered by the policies of the Grand Vizier, Ahmad Khan Bangash attacked Safdarjung's possessions in Awadh, during which Safdarjung was wounded in the neck.\n\nSafdarjung responded by amassing an army that included Jat and Maratha mercenaries. This defeated Qudsia Begum's loyalists in Rohilkhand, at which point Ahmad Shah demanded an immediate cease of hostilities. Safdarjung obeyed but also ordered his Turkish units, led by Muhammad Ali Jerchi, to assassinate Javed Khan for his involvement in the malevolence in August 1752.\n\nSafdarjung's action cleared the path for the rise of Qudsia Begum's opponents within Javed Khan's faction, such as Intizam-ud-Daula.\n\nIn the year 1752 the Maratha Confederacy imposed a unilateral proctorate over the Mughal imperial court in Delhi.\n\nThis move caused the emperor and his subjects to retaliate against the Peshwa in 1754.\n\nIn May 1753, Ahmad Shah Bahadur chose the 18-year-old Ghazi-ud-din-Feroze Jung III, the son of the dead Intizam-ud-Daula, to counter the growing influence of Safdarjung. Feroze Jung III gathered opposition to Safdarjung, and was joined by Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech, Qudsia Begum and Ahmad Shah Bahadur himself. Safdarjung was defeated and stripped of his estates and authority but the influence of supporters such as Suraj Mal meant that he was forgiven and allowed to withdraw to Awadh.\n\nFeroze Jung III then emerged as the new regent. His prowess was feared by Ahmad Shah Bahadur, who soon became estranged from him after Feroze Jung III collected 1,500,000 \"dams\" and refused to pay salaries to the Mughal army and imperial officials. Ahmad Shah Bahadur soon after declared Safdarjung to be his Grand Vizier. He tried to have Feroze Jung III removed from the imperial court, which caused Feroze Jung III to send Aqibat Mahmud to arrest the emperor and then seek an alliance with the Maratha's force led by Sadashivrao Bhau, the cousin of the Peshwa Nanasaheb I\n\nEven though cannons and sharpshooters were loaded upon the elephants. The Emperor was defeated at Sikandarabad by the Maratha Confederacy.\n\nAccording to the Marathas, 8000 warriors were captured (mostly women). And the imperial household was humiliated.\n\n\"Sikandarabad Incident\" is considered to be the last raid conducted by the emperor against the Maratha Confederacy.\n\nBut Feroze Jung III and his allies had realised this plan. Aided by the Marathas, led by Malhar Rao Holkar, he defeated Safdarjung. The Emperor then collected a large army and camped at Sikandarabad, where the Maratha chieftain Sadashivrao Bhau, Malhar Rao Holkar and 2,000 Marathas, together with Feroze Jung III, routed his army at the First Battle of Sikandarabad (1754). Ahmad Shah fled to Delhi, leaving his mother, wives and a retinue of 8,000 women behind. Feroze Jung III (with the support of Raghunathrao) proceeded to Delhi, where he imprisoned both the emperor and his mother.\n\nMeanwhile, following the battle at Sikandarabad, the ailing Safdarjung fled to Awadh and a Mughal general laid siege to Bhurtpore, which Suraj Mal and his Jat rebels controlled. After being reinstated as the Grand Vizier, Feroze Jung III moved out of Delhi to support his lieutenant with a fresh supply of ammunition.\n\nIt was during this confrontation that Feroze Jung III claimed that Ahmad Shah Bahadur sent secret dispatches to Suraj Mal, encouraging him to fight and promised to advance to the aid of the Jats. He had intercepted the letters, made peace with Suraj Mal, and returned to Delhi, where he blinded Ahmad Shah. After hearing of this action Safdarjung fell ill and died.\n\nThe weak but influential Ahmad Shah Bahadur maintained correspondence from distant loyal vassals and Nawabs such as Chanda Sahib, Nawab of Tinnevelly (his southernmost subject) and Muzaffar Jung.\n\nMuhammad Shah bestowed him with the title Nasir Jung and later the next Mughal Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur appointed him as the Subedar of the Deccan and bestowed him with the title \"Nasir-ud-Daula\", he was killed by the renegade Himmat Khan in 1750.\n\nIn 1749 Joseph François Dupleix allied with Chanda Sahib and Muzaffar Jung, the two strong designated Mughal administrators in the Deccan and sought bring them into power in their respective regions. Other leaders such as Hyder Ali also sided with the French. Soon the Chanda Sahib, Muzzafar Jung and the French led by Patissier and De Bussy had the capacity to defeat the alarmed Nawab of the Carnatic Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan during the Battle of Ambur.\n\nIn response to this power struggle among the Mughal subjects in the Deccan, Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah and Nasir Jung aligned themselves with the English in 1750. When Nasir Jung tried to recapture Gingee Fort, from De Bussy he was halted, defeated and killed by the forces of the troublesome Himmat Khan, the Nawab of Kadapa. Dupleix, who was the real power behind the successors, soon delegated a formidable governance to his allies: Muzaffar Jung was declared the Nizam of Mughal lands in eastern-Deccan and Chanda Sahib was declared the new Nawab of the Carnatic. The French were perceived as powerful aristocrats throughout the Mughal Empire; their English counterparts, however, had their reputations tarnished by the alleged acts of piracy since the days of Aurangzeb.\n\nSalabat Khan, the \"Mir Bakshi\" and commander of the Mughal army, was joined by Bhakt Singh in Marwar against the forces of Ram Singh and Ishvari Singh. The sides fought each other in 1750 at the Battle of Raona. Immediately after the battle, Ishwari Singh reconciled with Salabat Khan and the confrontation ended in ceasefire. Soon afterwards the Maratha Confederacy invaded Jaipur and Ishwari Singh committed suicide.\n\nIn 1750, Muin-ul-Mulk ceded territories to Ahmad Shah Durrani in order to seek an end to all hostilities. However, Ahmad Shah Durrani invaded again in 1751 and occupied Kashmir the opposing Mughals led by Muin-ul-Mulk were entirely defeated and captured in 1753. Ahmad Shah Durrani pardoned captured Mughal viceroy Muin-ul-Mulk due to his courageousness in battle and reappointed Muin-ul-Mulk as his representative with the permission of the Mughal Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur.\n\nVarious chieftains of the Maratha Confederacy had from two fronts defeated the subjects of Ahmad Shah Bahadur in Gujarat and Orissa.\n\nIn 1750, the Marathas annexed Gujarat from the Mughals, and fierce battles continued between the two sides it was during that havoc that the Raj Bovri Mosque complex was destroyed during a massive fray in 1753.\n\nIn response to the annexation of Gujarat, the Mughal Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur appointed and strengthened the Nawab of Junagarh Nawab Muhammad Bahadur Khanji and bestowed various titles and authority to various entities loyal to the Mughal Empire in the region. Ahmad Shah Bahadur and Safdarjung also dispatched Salabat Khan and an army of 18,000 to an expedition to quell all rebels in Rajput territories and to gather support for the regions garrisons.\n\nIn 1751 after defending his territories from the Marathas for nearly 11 years, Alivardi Khan the Nawab of Bengal, and \"Faujdars\" from various regions such as Patna, Dacca and Orissa were overrun by large force of Marathas under the command of Raghoji I Bhonsle, who eventually annexed Odisha for the Maratha Confederacy.\n\nIn 1751, Chanda Sahib and his lieutenants Reza Sahib and Muhammed Yusuf Khan were defeated by Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah and Clive during the Battle of Arcot. Later onward's Muzaffar Jung faced the averse uncooperative Nawabs of Kurnool, Cuddapah and Savanur after they jointly attacked Muzaffar Jung' encampments of 3000 troops, during the confrontation the Nawab of Savanur was killed, the Nawab of Kurnool was shot and wounded but apathetic Himmat Khan, the Nawab of Kadapa, challenged Muzaffar Jung to a duel. Charging their Howdah's at each other, they eliminated each other in combat.\n\nThe news of Muzaffar Jung's death had created a great sense of shock and panic among the Mughals and the French were also affected by this unforeseeable event. De Bussy rose to the occasion and almost risked the wrath of the imperial court when he chose his brother Salabat Jung as the new \"Subedar of the Deccan\", without the approval of Ahmad Shah Bahadur. Together they entered Hyderabad on 12 April and then marched against the Marathas to strengthen the Mughal garrison at Aurangabad on 18 June. Unwilling to allow his brother to gain power, Intizam-ud-Daula, an influential general in the Mughal army, abandoned his post and threatened to march into the Deccan with an army of 150,000 and overthrow Salabat Jung with the assistance of their Maratha adversary Balaji Bajirao.\n\nInstead of awaiting an imminent invasion Dupleix decided to challenge the Marathas and inflicted a defeat upon their leader Balaji Bajirao by taking advantage of a lunar eclipse in December 1751. The coalition of De Bussy and Salabat Jung efficiently marched towards Poona delivering a series of crushing defeats upon the Marathas and their allies for the first time in decades. In the following year De Bussy enforced the Peace Treaty of Ahmadnagar upon the Marathas.\n\nIntizam-ud-Daula was poisoned by his own troops for pursuing an alliance with Balaji Bajirao. The Nawab of the Carnatic Chanda Sahib was killed in a mutiny after he was defeated by Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah and Clive in 1752. Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah was then recognised as the next Nawab of the Carnatic, mainly by arousing the sympathies of Ahmad Shah Bahadur.\n\nIn 1753, De Bussy led his coalition in order to capture the Northern Circars this move would also trigger another series of victories against the Maratha chieftain Raghoji I Bhonsle in 1754. This campaign continued until 1757 and Salabat Jung and De Bussy's inflicted a series of upon the Maratha around their own strongholds near Poona. This alliance with the French had greatly contributed to the advancement of Salabat Jung's forces, in 1756 Salabat Jung's forces utilised heavy muskets known as \"Catyocks\", which were attached to the ground, it was known to have fired more rapidly than a cannon. These new weapons would completely reverse fortunes of the Maratha rebels.\n\nAfter his deposition in 1754, Ahmad Shah Bahadur was imprisoned at the Salimgarh Fort. He stayed there for the rest of his life, dying in 1775 at the age of 50 during the reign of Emperor Shah Alam II. One of his sons, Bidar Bakht reigned briefly in 1788.\n"}

Harris and her fiancé, Major Henry Rathbone, were the guests of President Lincoln and First Lady Mary Lincoln when John Wilkes Booth fatally shot the President at Ford's Theatre in April 1865.\n\nHarris was born in Albany, New York, one of four children of U.S. Senator Ira Harris of New York, and his first wife Louisa Harris (née Tubbs). Harris' mother Louisa died in 1845. On August 1, 1848, Ira Harris married Pauline Rathbone (née Penney), the widow of Jared L. Rathbone, a successful merchant who later became the mayor of Albany. Jared and Pauline Rathbone had four children (two of whom, Anna and Charles, died in infancy) including sons, Jared, Jr. and Henry Rathbone.\n\nAlthough Harris and Henry Rathbone were raised in the same household and were related by their parents' marriage, they fell in love and later became engaged. Their engagement was interrupted when the American Civil War broke out in 1861 and Henry Rathbone joined the Union Army that year and became major in 1869 upon joining the 5th United States Infantry. \n\nOn April 14, 1865, Major Rathbone and his fiancée Clara accepted an invitation to see a play at Ford's Theatre from President Abraham Lincoln and his wife, First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. The couple, who had been friends with the President and his wife for some time, were invited after Ulysses S. Grant and his wife Julia, Thomas Eckert and several other people had declined Mrs. Lincoln's invitation to the play.\n\nWhile watching the play \"Our American Cousin\" in the Presidential Box at Ford's Theatre that evening, John Wilkes Booth fatally shot President Lincoln in the back of the head. When Rathbone attempted to apprehend Booth after the shooting, Booth slashed Rathbone with a Bowie knife from left elbow to shoulder. Rathbone lost a considerable amount of blood which stained Harris' white dress, face and hands when she attempted to aid him.\n\nDespite being seriously wounded, Rathbone escorted First Lady Mary Lincoln to the Petersen House where doctors had decided to take the mortally wounded President. Shortly after arriving at the Petersen House, Rathbone passed out due to loss of blood. Harris arrived at the house soon after and held Rathbone's head in her lap while he drifted in and out of consciousness. A surgeon who had been attending the President finally examined Rathbone and realized his wound was more serious than initially thought. Booth had severed an artery located just above Rathbone's elbow and had cut him nearly to the bone. Rathbone was taken home while Harris decided to stay with Mrs. Lincoln. Harris later stated:\n\nPoor Mrs. Lincoln, all through that dreadful night would look at me with horror & scream, 'oh! my husband's blood, my dear husband's blood'...It was Henry's blood, not the president's, but explanations were pointless.\n\nWhile Rathbone eventually recovered from the attack, President Lincoln died of his wound the following morning. After the assassination, Rathbone blamed himself for not preventing Lincoln's death. He spent the remainder of his life battling delusions and seeking treatments for other physical problems including constant headaches.\n\nHarris and Rathbone were married on July 11, 1867. The couple had three children: Henry Riggs (born February 12, 1870), who later became a U.S. Congressman from Illinois, Gerald Lawrence (born August 26, 1871) and Clara Pauline (born September 15, 1872). Rathbone, who had risen to the rank of colonel, resigned from the Army in December 1870. The family settled in Washington D.C. where Rathbone's mental health deteriorated. Rathbone's behavior became increasingly erratic and he began drinking heavily, gambling and having affairs. Due to his behavior, Rathbone found it difficult to hold a job for an extended period of time.\n\nEvery year on the anniversary of Lincoln's assassination, journalists would contact the couple with questions about Lincoln's death, furthering Rathbone's feelings of guilt. Harris later wrote to a friend:\n\nI understand his distress...in every hotel we're in, as soon as people get wind of our presence, we feel ourselves become objects of morbid scrutiny... Whenever we were in the dining room, we began to feel like zoo animals. Henry...imagines that the whispering is more pointed and malicious than it can possibly be.\n\nAs time went on, Rathbone's mental instability worsened and he often became jealous of other men who paid attention to Harris and resented the attention Harris paid their children. He also reportedly threatened his wife on several occasions, convinced that Harris was going to divorce him and take the children. Despite his behavior, Rathbone was appointed U.S. Consul to the Province of Hanover by President Chester Alan Arthur in 1882. The family relocated to Germany where Rathbone's mental health continued to decline.\n\nOn December 23, 1883, Henry Rathbone attacked his family in a fit of madness. He fatally shot his wife in the head and then attempted to kill the children, but a groundskeeper prevented him from doing so. Rathbone then stabbed himself five times in the chest in an attempted suicide. Blaming his crime on an intruder, Rathbone was charged with murder and declared insane by doctors. He was convicted and committed to an asylum for the criminally insane in Hildesheim, Germany, where he died on August 14, 1911. The couple's children were sent to live with their uncle, William Harris, in the United States.\n\nHarris was buried in the city cemetery at Hanover/Engesohde. Her husband was buried next to her upon his death in 1911. In 1952, the \nRathbones' remains were disinterred and disposed of after cemetery management determined that their graves had not been visited or were no longer of interest to the family.\n\n"}

Aside from EPs and split releases, the band released a compilation album called \"Crippled Lucifer\", which had songs of their early EPs.\n\nBurning Witch formed on Capitol Hill, Seattle in early 1995. After the breakup of the doom/death band Thorr's Hammer in 1995, Stephen O'Malley, Greg Anderson and Jamie Sykes formed Burning Witch. The band then added G. Stuart Dahlquist and vocalist Edgy 59, rounding out their lineup. Anderson left the band before they had recorded any real Burning Witch songs to start the band Goatsnake.\n\nIn 1996, the band in this incarnation recorded songs with renowned indie producer Steve Albini, which would become the \"Towers...\" EP. This collection would actually not see a formal release until 1998 on Slap A Ham Records. After the sessions for these songs, Sykes left the band and was replaced by B.R.A.D. \n\nThe sessions that followed the Albini recordings resulted in the \"Rift.Canyon.Dreams\" EP, which would prove to be the final recordings by the band, as they broke up soon after the disc was completed. It was released on Merciless Records, but like its predecessor, did not receive much attention outside its scene.\n\n\"Crippled Lucifer\", a compilation CD of the two EPs, was released soon after on Southern Lord Records, the label founded by Anderson and O'Malley. Burning Witch performed their last shows in the fall of 1998 after which Edgy 59 left for Sinisstar, O'Malley reunited with Anderson to form Sunn O))), and Dahlquist joined Anderson in Goatsnake. Currently, O'Malley is in various projects including Sunn O))). Dahlquist and B.R.A.D are in Asva, and Edgy 59 has a project also with G. Stuart Dahlquist called The Poisoned Glass.\n\nMost of the music of Burning Witch is very slow and heavy with the drums slowly plodding along with the bass and guitar playing minimalist riffs. Emphasis is usually put on spaces between notes, allowing the bass and guitar to resonate before proceeding to the next note. There are occasional bursts of feedback and noise from O'Malley, but for the most part the guitar and bass follow each other. One of the qualities of Burning Witch is Edgy 59's vocals which alter between a nasal and melodic singing voice to a brutal, tortured, and demented scream or shriek.\n\nThere are noticeable differences between the songs on \"Towers...\" and \"Rift. Canyon.Dreams\" with \"Towers...\" being more intense and aggressive and \"Rift.Canyon.Dreams\" being more morose and brooding. \n\nThe \"Crippled Lucifer\" compilation contains all but one song from their two LPs. \"Goatsnake/Burning Witch\" split contains two songs, one from each of the LP recording sessions (and the one omitted from \"Crippled Lucifer\"), and the Asva / Burning Witch split contains the song \"Rift. Canyon.Dreams\".\n\nA lot of terms have been used to describe Burning Witch's highly untraditional sound. Among these are \"suicide doom\", \"transdimensional drone doom\", \"true blackened doom\", and \"molasses sludge\". Stephen O'Malley has said these descriptions are \"ridiculous\", insisting Burning Witch is just slow and heavy doom with unique vocals. There is a natural progression in the sound of Burning Witch to the pair's later project Sunn O))), especially on \"Black One\". Comparisons can also be made to O'Malley's later project Khanate.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1934790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934790", "title": "Shah Alam II", "text": "Shah Alam II\n\nAli Gohar (25 June 1728 – 19 November 1806), historically known as Shah Alam II, was the sixteenth Mughal Emperor and the son of Alamgir II. Shah Alam II became the emperor of a crumbling Mughal empire. His power was so depleted during his reign that it led to a saying in the Persian language, \"Sultanat-e-Shah Alam, Az Dilli ta Palam\", meaning, 'The empire of Shah Alam is from Delhi to Palam', Palam being a suburb of Delhi.\n\nShah Alam faced many invasions, mainly by the Emir of Afghanistan, Ahmed Shah Abdali, which led to the Third Battle of Panipat between the Maratha Empire, who maintained suzerainty over Mughal affairs in Delhi and the Afghans led by Abdali. In 1760, the invading forces of Abdali were driven away by the Marathas, led by Sadashivrao Bhau, who deposed Shah Jahan III, the puppet Mughal emperor of Feroze Jung III, and installed Shah Alam II as the rightful emperor under Maratha control.\n\nShah Alam II was considered the only and rightful emperor, but he wasn't able to return to Delhi until 1772, under the protection of the Maratha general Mahadaji Shinde. He also fought against the British East India Company at the Battle of Buxar.\n\nShah Alam II authored his own \"Diwan\" of poems and was known by the pen-name \"Aftab\". His poems were guided, compiled and collected by Mirza Fakhir Makin.\n\nShah Alam also penned famous book Ajaib-ul-Qasas which is considered one of the earliest and prominent book of prose in Urdu.\n\nAli Gohar was born to \"Shahzada\" (Prince) Aziz-ud-Din, son of the deposed Mughal Emperor Jahandar Shah, on 25 June 1728. Alongside his father, he grew up in semi-captivity in the Salatin quarters of the Red Fort. However, unlike the majority of Mughal princes growing up in similar circumstances, he is not recorded to have become a decadent prince by the time his father became emperor, and therefore was naturally given high appointments in the course of his father's reign.\n\nUpon his father's accession, he became the \"Wali Ahd\" (Crown Prince) of the empire, and became his father's principal agent, though almost all power lay in the Wazir Imad-ul-Mulk's hand. His quarrels with that amir, and fear for his own life, caused him to flee from Delhi in 1758.\n\nPrince Ali Gauhar, afterwards Emperor Shah Alam II, had been the heir apparent of his father Alamgir II. Prince Ali Gauhar's father had been appointed Mughal Emperor by Vizier Feroze Jung III and Maratha Peshwa's brother Sadashivrao Bhau who had completely dominated and later killed Alamgir II and kept Prince Ali Gauhar under surveillance. \n\nPrince Ali Gauhar organized a militia and made a daring escape from Delhi, Prince Ali Gauhar appeared in the Eastern Subah in 1759, hoping to strengthen his position by attempting to regaining control over Bengal, Bihar and Odisha.\n\nVery soon however, Najib-ud-Daula, forced the usurper Feroze Jung III to flee from the capitol after he gathered a large Mughal Army outside Delhi, which deposed the recreant Shah Jahan III. Najib-ud-Daula and Muslim nobles then planned to defeat the Marathas by maintaining correspondence with the powerful Ahmad Shah Durrani. After Durrani decisively defeated the Marathas, he nominated Ali Gauhar as the emperor under the name Shah Alam II.\n\nIn 1760, after Shah Alam's militia gaining control over pockets in Bengal, Bihar and parts of Odisha, Prince Ali Gauhar and his Mughal Army of 30,000 intended to overthrow Mir Jafar and Feroze Jung III after they tried to capture or kill him by advancing towards Awadh and Patna in 1759. But the conflict soon involved the intervention of the assertive East India Company. \n\nThe Mughals clearly intended to recapture their breakaway Eastern Subah led by Prince Ali Gauhar, who was accompanied by a Militia consisting of persons like Muhammad Quli Khan, Kadim Husein, Kamgar Khan, Hidayat Ali, Mir Afzal and Ghulam Husain Tabatabai. Their forces were reinforced by the forces of Shuja-ud-Daula, Najib-ud-Daula and Ahmad Shah Bangash. The Mughals were also joined by Jean Law and 200 Frenchmen and waged a campaign against the British during the Seven Years' War.\n\nPrince Ali Gauhar successfully advanced as far as Patna, which he later besieged with a combined army of over 40,000 in order to capture or kill Ramnarian a sworn enemy of the Mughals. Mir Jafar was in terror at the near demise of his cohort and sent his own son Miran to relieve Ramnarian and retake Patna. Mir Jafar also implored the aid of Robert Clive, but it was Major John Caillaud, who dispersed Prince Ali Gauhar's army in 1761 after four major battles including Battle of Patna, Battle of Sirpur, Battle of Birpur and Battle of Siwan.\n\nAfter negotiations assuring peace Shah Alam II was escorted by the British to meet Mir Qasim the new Nawab of Bengal, who was nominated after the sudden death of Miran. Mir Qasim soon had the Mughal Emperor's investiture as Subedar of Bengal, Bihar and Odisha, and agreed to pay an annual revenue of 2.4 million \"dam\". Shah Alam II then retreated to Allahabad was protected by the Shuja-ud-Daula, Nawab of Awadh from 1761 until 1764. Meanwhile, Mir Qasim's relations with the British East India company began to worsen. He initiated reforms that withdrew the tax exemption enjoyed by the British East India Company, he also ousted Ramnarian a sworn enemy of the Mughal Empire and created Firelock manufacturing factories at Patna with the sole purpose of giving advantage to the newly reformed Mughal Army.\n\nAngered by these developments the East India Company sought his ouster. Court intrigues encouraged by the East India company forced Mir Qasim to leave Bengal, Bihar and Odisha. Mir Qasim on his part encouraged Shuja-ud-Daula the Nawab of Awadh and Shah Alam II to engage the British.\n\nShah Alam II was acknowledged emperor by the Durrani Empire. His declared reign extended to the 24 Parganas of the Sundarbans, Mir Qasim, Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad (and Bihar),\"Raja of Banares\", Nizam of Hyderabad, Nawab of Ghazipur, Sahib of Punjab, Hyder Ali's Mysore, Nawab of Kadapa and Nawab of Kurnool, Nawab of the Carnatic of Arcot and Nellore, Nawab of Junagarh, Rohilkhand of Lower Doab, Rohilkhand of Upper Doab, and Nawab of Bhawalpur.\n\nThe Battle of Buxar was fought on 22 October 1764 between the combined armies of Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal; Shuja-ud-Daula the Nawab of Awadh; the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II and the forces under the command of the British East India Company led by Hector Munro. The battle fought at Buxar, a town located on the bank of the Ganges river then within the territory of Bengal, was a decisive victory for the British East India Company.\n\nSoon after the Battle of Buxar, Shah Alam II, a sovereign who had just been defeated by the British, sought their protection by signing the Treaty of Allahabad in the year 1765. Shah Alam II was forced to grant the \"Diwani\" (right to collect revenue) of Bengal (which included Bihar and Odisha) to the British East India Company in return for an annual tribute of 2.6 million rupees to be paid by the company from the collected revenue. Tax exempt status was also restored to the company. The company further secured for the districts of Kora and Allahabad which allowed the British East India Company to collect tax from more than 20 million people. East India company thus became the Imperial tax collector in the former Mughal province of Bengal (which included Bihar and Odisha). East India company appointed a deputy Nawab Muhammad Reza Khan to collect revenue on behalf of the company.\n\nShah Alam II's absence from Delhi was due to the terms of the treaty he had signed with the British. But his son and heir apparent Prince Mirza Jawan Bakht and Najib-ul-Daula, represented the emperor for the next 12 years in Delhi.\n\nThe Bengal Famine in 1770 was a massive catastrophe that signalled the end of the Mughal Empire and disorder in the Indian Subcontinent.\n\nBy the time the famine occurred it became very clear that the Mughal Empire was no longer a major political power, not only in the general world but also within South Asia.\n\nShah Alam II returned to the throne in Delhi in 1772, under the protection of the Maratha general Mahadaji Shinde. The emperor became a client of the Maratha whose Peshwa demanded tribute, which the Moguls are known to have paid so as to avoid any further conflict with the Confederacy.\n\nThe emperor resided in the fort of Allahabad for six years. Warren Hastings, the head of East India company got appointed as the first Governor of Bengal in 1774. This was the period of \"Dual rule\" where East India company enacted laws to maximise collection of revenue and the Mughal Emperor appointed Nawab looked after other affairs of the province. East India company later discontinued the tribute of 2.6 million Rupees and later also handed over the districts of Allahabad and Kara to the Nawab of Awadh. These measures amounted to a repudiation of the company's vassalage to the emperor as Diwan (tax collector). In 1793 East India Company was strong enough and abolished Nizamat (local rule) completely and annexed Bengal. Weakened Shah Alam II agreed to the consultation of the East India Company, who advised him never to trust the Marathas.\n\nIn the year 1771 the Marathas under Mahadji Shinde returned to northern India and even captured Delhi. Shah Alam II, was escorted by Mahadaji Shinde and left Allahabad in May 1771 and in January 1772 reached Delhi. Along with the Marathas they undertook to win the crown lands of Rohilkhand and defeated Zabita Khan, capturing the fort of Pathar garh with its treasure.\n\nIn the year 1787, an embassy of Bijaya Singh from Jodhpur presented itself to the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, bringing homage and the golden key of the Fortress of Ajmer.\n\nAfter killing Ghulam Qadir and restoring Shah Alam II to the throne, a Maratha garrison permanently occupied Delhi in 1788 and ruled on north India for next two decades until they were usurped by the British East India Company in the Second Anglo-Maratha War.\n\nOne of his first acts was to strengthen and raise a new Mughal Army, under the command of Mirza Najaf Khan. This new army consisted of infantrymen who successfully utilised both Flintlocks and Talwars in combat formations, they utilised elephants for transportation and were less dependent on artillery and cavalry. Mirza Najaf Khan is also known to have introduced the more-effective Firelock muskets through his collaboration with Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal.\n\nShah Alam II, was well supported by Jean Law de Lauriston and 200 Frenchmen during his campaign to regain the Eastern Subahs (during the Seven Years' War). The brainchild of the campaign was Ghulam Husain Tabatabai, who had gained much administrative and military experience from both the French and the Dutch.\n\nAfter Shah Alam II's defeat in the Battle of Buxar, the French once again reached out to emperor under Pierre André de Suffren in the year 1781, who initiated a plan to capture Bombay and Surat from the Maratha Confederacy and the British, with the co-operation of Mirza Najaf Khan, this action would eventually lead to Asaf Jah II to join Shah Alam II and the French and assist Hyder Ali to capture Madras from the British East India Company. The internal conflicts within the Mughal imperial court would not allow the emperor to make such a bold move against the British.\n\nThe Rumi Darwaza, which stands sixty feet tall, was modelled (1784) after the Sublime Porte (Bab-i Hümayun) in Istanbul, is one of the very important examples of the exchange between the two cultures.\n\nJats rose in retaliation of religious intolerance pursued by Aurangzeb. The Jat kingdom of Bharatpur waged many wars against the Mughal Delhi and in the 17th and 18th century carried out numerous campaigns in Mughal territories including Agra. Mughals were defeated by Marathas in 1757; and Mughal possessions and territories were under the annexation of the Jat's led by Suraj Mal.\n\nDuring one massive assault, Jats sieged Agra in 1761, after 20 days on 12 June 1761 the Mughal forces at Agra surrendered to Jats. Jats plundered the city as was the norm of victors during those days. They carried the bounty, including the two great silver doors to the entrance of the famous Taj Mahal. which were carried off and melted down by Suraj Mal in 1764.\n\nSuraj Mal's son Jawahar Singh, further extended the Jat power in Northern India and captured the territory in Doab, Ballabgarh and Agra. Jats kept Agra fort and other territories closer to Delhi under their control from 1761 till 1774 CE.\n\nSikhs had been in perpetual war against Mughal intolerance specially after beheading of the Sikh Guru - Guru Teg Bahadur by the Mughals. Simmering Sikhs rose once again in the year 1764 and overran the Mughal Faujdar of Sirhind, Zain Khan Sirhindi, who fell in battle and ever since the Sikhs perpetually raided and took the bounties from the lands as far as Delhi practically every year. They attacked, won and extracted payments from Delhi three times in 11 years particularly in 1772, 1778 and 1783. And it is believed that the Sikhs even had informants, probably even the Viziers of Shah Alam II. There was ongoing warfare with the Sikhs who were regaining their traditional homeland in eastern Punjab and also attacking the Rohilla, Mewar and Jat lands. During Shah Alam II's reign the Sikhs fought not just with the Mughals, but with the Marathas, Rajputs, and Rohillas.\n\nThe Marathas took Delhi in 1772 before Shah Alam II arrived. Mirza Najaf Khan had restored a sense of order to the Mughal finances and administration and particularly reformed the Mughal Army. In 1777 Mirza Najaf Khan decisively defeated Zabita Khan's forces and repelled the Sikhs after halting their raids.\n\nIn 1778, after a Sikh incursion into Delhi, Shah Alam ordered their defeat by appointing, the Mughal Grand Vizier, Majad-ud-Daula marched with 20,000 Mughal troops against the Sikh army into hostile territories, this action led to the defeat of the Mughal Army at Muzzaffargarh and later at Ghanaur, due to the mounted casualties Shah Alam II reappointed Mirza Najaf Khan, who soon died of natural circumstances leaving the Mughal Empire weaker than ever.\n\nIn the year 1779, Mirza Najaf Khan carefully advanced his forces who successfully routed the treasonous Zabita Khan and his Sikh allies who lost more than 5,000 men in a single battle and never returned to threaten the Mughal Empire during the commander Mirza Najaf Khan's lifetime. Najaf Khan as prime minister, granted sovereign rights to the Sikhs as agreement.\n\nIn the year 1783, Farzana Zeb un-Nissa had saved Delhi from a possible invasion by a force of 30,000 Sikh troops, under Baghel Singh, Jassa Singh Ramgarhia and Jassa Singh Ahluwalia.\n\nMughal empire disintegrated to such an extent that Shah Alam II was only left with Delhi city to rule. 1781, Jassa Singh Ahluwalia and Baghel Singh laid siege to the city. After entering Red fort, Jassa Singh Ahluwalia sat on the Mughal throne on behest of Baghel Singh and a title of Badshah Singh was given to him. Begum Samru requested Baghel Singh to show mercy on Shah Alam II. Baghel Singh accepted and stated his demands such as 30000 of his troops to stay in Delhi and the Mughal Empire would pay for their maintenance. Other demands were the construction of atleast 5 Gurdwaras and annual tax payment of 13.5%. The demands were agreed upon by Shah Alam II with a written agreement. Since Sikhs refused to accept authority of the Mughal court due to politics, Mahadji Shinde was given the regency with an agreement that he will pay the Sikhs 1/3 of the revenue annually.\n\nZabita Khan was the Rohilla chief who reached a settlement with the Sikhs and merely became their puppet. He requested to be baptised to Sikhism to prove his loyalty to Sikhs. After his baptism which was performed by Baghel Singh, Zabita Khan was given Sikh name Dharam Singh. Rohilla chief entered Delhi unleashing terror and causing Shah Alam II to go blind on August 1786. This treacherous act was unaccepted by the Sikhs and Zabita Khan was disowned leaving him with no allies. Zabita Khan was captured and executed by the Marathas for the atrocities committed by him in the city.\n\n1799, Ranjit Singh brought all the Sikh Misls together to form an empire, the Sikh Empire.\n\nAfter the defeats at Muzaffargarh and later at Ghanaur, Majad-ud-Daula was arrested by the orders of Shah Alam II, who then recalled Mirza Najaf Khan. This led to the former Grand Vizier's arrest for causing miscalculations and collaborating with the enemies of the emperor. The traitor was imprisoned and a sum of two million \"dam\" in stolen revenue recovered from him. It was Shah Alam II's poor judgement and vacillation that led to his own downfall. Mirza Najaf Khan had given the Mughal Empire breathing space by having a powerful, well managed army in its own right. In 1779 the newly reformed Mughal Army decisively defeated Zabita Khan and his Sikh allies the rebels lost 5,000 men including their leader and therefore did not return during the lifetime of Mirza Najaf Khan. Unfortunately upon the general's death, Shah Alam's bad judgement prevailed. The dead man's nephew, Mirza Shafi whose valour had been proven during various occasions, was not appointed commander in chief. Shah Alam II instead appointed worthless individuals whose loyalty and record were questionable at best. They were soon quarrelling over petty matters. Even the corrupt and treasonous former Grand Vizier, Majad-ud-Daula was restored to his former office, he later colluded with the Sikhs and reduced the size of the Mughal Army from over 20,000 to only 5,000 thus bringing the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II at the mercy of his ruffian enemies.\n\nNawab Majad-ud-Daula was followed by a known enemy of the Mughals, the grandson of Najib Khan, Ghulam Qadir, with his Sikh allies forced Shah Alam II to appoint him as the Grand Vizier of the Mughal Empire. Petty, avaricious and insane Ghulam Qadir ravaged the palaces in search of the Mughal treasure believed to be worth Rs.250 million. Unable to locate even a fraction of that sum and angered by the Mughal Emperor's attempts to eliminate him and his Sikh allies, Ghulam Qadir himself blinded Shah Alam II with an Afghani knife on 10 August 1788. A drunken ruffian, Ghulam Qadir behaved with gross brutality to the emperor and his family. Three servants and two water-carriers who tried to help the bleeding emperor were beheaded and according to one account, Ghulam Qadir would pull the beard of the elderly Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II. After ten horrible weeks, during which Ghulam Qadir stripped the princesses of the royal family naked and forced them to dance naked before him (after which they jumped into Yamuna river to drown) and the honour of the royal family and prestige of the Mughal Empire reached its lowest ebb, Mahadaji Shinde intervened and killed Ghulam Qadir, taking possession of Delhi on 2 October 1788. He restored Shah Alam II to the throne and acted as his protector. Mahadaji Shinde sent the ears and eyes of Ghulam Qadir to Shah Alam. \n\nThankful for his intervention, he honoured Mahadji Shinde with the titles of \"Vakil-ul-Mutlaq\" (Regent of the Empire) and \"Amir-ul-Amara\" (Head of the Amirs). \nAfter killing Ghulam Qadir and restoring Shah Alam II to the throne, a Maratha garrison permanently occupied Delhi in 1788 and ruled on north India for next 15 years until they were overthrown by the British East India Company following the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1803.\n\nThe French threat in Europe and its possible repercussions in India caused the British to strive to regain the custody of Shah Alam II. The British feared that the French military officers might overthrow Maratha power and use the authority of the Mughal emperor to further French ambition in India.\n\nShah Alam II also corresponded with Hyder Ali and later with his son Tipu Sultan during their conflicts with the British East India Company during the Anglo-Mysore Wars and was very well informed about the expansionist agenda of the British.\n\nAfter the Battle of Delhi (1803), during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, on 14 September 1803 British troops entered Delhi ending the Maratha rule on the Mughals, bringing Shah Alam, then a blind old man, seated under a tattered canopy, under British protection. The Mughal Emperor no longer had the military power to enforce his will, but he commanded respect as a dignified member of the House of Timur in the length and breadth of the country. The Nawabs and Subedars still sought formal sanction of the Mughal Emperor on their accession and valued the titles he bestowed upon them. They struck coins and read the \"khutba\" (Friday sermons) in his name. The Marathas in 1804 under Yashwantrao Holkar tried to snatch Delhi from the British in Siege of Delhi (1804), but failed.\n\nShah Alam II died of natural causes on 19 November 1806.\n\nHis grave lies next to the dargah of the 13th century Sufi saint, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki at Mehrauli, Delhi in a marble enclosure along with that of Bahadur Shah I (also known as Shah Alam I), and Akbar Shah II.\n\n\n"}

As a part of the Bundesautobahn 7 in Hamburg, the tunnel forms a connection between Schleswig-Holstein (and on towards Denmark) to the north and Lower Saxony to the south. It has 8 lanes in 4 bores. The newest, fourth bore is the only one to feature a hard shoulder, minimizing congestion due to broken down vehicles.\n\nThe tunnel was constructed from 1968 to 1975 with three bores, containing a total of six autobahn lanes serving the city of Hamburg. On 10 January 1975 the Chancellor of Germany, Helmut Schmidt, opened the Elbe Tunnel. The tunnel was constructed with a capacity for 65,000 cars daily.\nIn 1989 concrete tank barriers were constructed on the three south entrances. In war times these barriers would have been exploded out of their resting places. The barriers were removed in 2000 during construction of the 4th bore.\n\nTo meet the demands of increasing traffic, on 27 October 2002 a fourth bore was opened with two more lanes. It had been drilled through the ground by the then world's largest tunnel boring machine (TBM), which had a front plate 14.65 m (48 ft 1 in) in diameter. The machine's name was Trude, a short form of the name Gertrud, and an acronym for \"Tief runter unter die Elbe\" (deep down under the Elbe). The European Space Agency had helped in engineering aspects of the tunnel project for the tunnel boring machine.\n\nThe centre bores carry reversible lanes which switch direction in anticipation of commuter flows, similar to those of Caldecott Tunnel in Oakland, California. For example, more lanes are available for the morning commute into the city center in the northward direction Flensburg, and more in the southbound direction of Hanover for traffic leaving the city in the evening.\nThe tunnel operation office controls traffic with 72 visual monitors. Traffic lights, highway barriers and variable message signs are in use to regulate 150,000 vehicles per day.\n\nAll bores are equipped with an automated height control at each entrance. As soon as a vehicle with a height of more than 4 meters enters the tunnel, the system will stop all traffic in that lane and direction of traffic. This will ensure that overheight trucks will not damage the tunnel. The tunnel fire brigade and tunnel police will then direct the truck out of the tunnel so that traffic can resume.\n\n\n"}

It appeared in 107 two to seven-page episodes in \"Playboy\" magazine from October 1962 to September 1988. \"Little Annie Fanny\" is a humorous satire of contemporary American society and its sexual mores. Annie Fanny, the title character, is a statuesque, buxom young blonde woman who innocently finds herself nude in every episode. The series is notable for its painted, luminous color artwork and for being the first full-scale, multi-page comics feature in a major American publication.\n\nHarvey Kurtzman, a cartoonist, created the series at the culmination of his career. He had launched \"Mad\" magazine, worked briefly for \"Playboy\" publisher Hugh Hefner and on a series of solo and collaborative projects, then returned to working for Hefner with \"Little Annie Fanny\". Each episode of the comic strip was designed and written by Kurtzman and rendered in oil, tempera, and watercolor by Elder. Hefner edited each episode, often requiring detailed changes to ensure that the series remained true to the magazine's editorial style. Critical reaction was mixed, with most praising the elaborate, fully painted comic, but some dismissing it as falling short of Kurtzman's full potential. The complete series was first collected into two volumes in 2000 and 2001 by Dark Horse Comics.\n\nHarvey Kurtzman founded the satirical \"Mad\" magazine in 1952; an early fan was onetime cartoonist Hugh Hefner, who founded the men's magazine \"Playboy\" in 1953. Hefner offered Kurtzman an opportunity to conceive a new humor magazine for his enterprise, which the cartoonist accepted when he left \"Mad\" in 1956 in an ownership dispute. Kurtzman took most of the \"Mad\" artists with him, including frequent collaborator Will Elder, to create the adult-oriented humor magazine \"Trump\". Although it sold well, Hefner ran into financial problems in 1957 and halted \"Trump\" after two issues. He provided office space for the artists, from which they self-published the satirical magazine \"Humbug\" in 1957–58. It failed to gain a significant following, and a dejected Kurtzman began pitching feature proposals to \"Playboy\", all of which were rejected. However, he received a note from Hefner: \"I bow to no one in my appreciation for H. Kurtzman.\" Hefner's praise encouraged Kurtzman to meet with publisher Ian Ballantine and create \"Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book\" (1959). This introduced the innocent and idealistic Goodman Beaver, a male character who continued to appear—with artwork by Elder—in Kurtzman's \"Help!\" (1960).\n\nKurtzman continued to correspond with Hefner and \"Playboy\" executive editor Ray Russell, who was interested in Kurtzman's idea of a comic strip suitable for the magazine's audience and suggested \"satire ... as an excuse or rationale for a slick magazine to be publishing a comic strip.\" Although single-panel cartoons were an established part of the magazine, a comic strip was unprecedented and had to be justified. Kurtzman submitted some Goodman Beaver strips and was surprised to receive a favorable response from Hefner, who liked the \"fresh and eager\" character. He especially enjoyed \"Goodman Goes Playboy\", which featured a boisterous romp in Hefner's mansion. Hefner nevertheless insisted that the material was not right for his magazine, but requested an explanation of the character with a suggestion: \"Maybe there is a way of launching a similar series ... that can somehow be related to \"Playboy\"\". Kurtzman replied that Goodman Beaver \"could be foolish and at the same time wise,\" and that he \"innocently partakes of the bad while espousing the good.\" He further stated that Beaver's innocent, restive, and charming nature allotted him especial creative freedom. A week later, Kurtzman wrote to Hefner, \"What would you think of a girl character ... whom I could apply to my kind of situations?\" Six weeks later Hefner replied, \"I think your notion of doing a Goodman Beaver strip of two, three, or four pages, but using a sexy girl ... is a bull's eye. We can run it every issue.\"\n\nKurtzman recruited his long-time collaborator Will Elder to work on the strip's illustrations. He suggested to Elder an \"outlineless\", painted style, then thought the strip would be better suited by an India inked, outlined comic book style with flat color behind it. Hefner, whose opinion prevailed, preferred the more difficult, fully painted, outlineless look. Kurtzman's suggestions for the feature's name included \"The Perils of Zelda\", \"The Perils of Irma\", and \"Little Mary Mixup\"; he settled on \"Little Annie Fanny\", its title and logo a parody of Harold Gray's \"Little Orphan Annie\". The cartoonist began submitting story ideas for the multi-page comic strip to Hefner for approval. Over the twenty-six years he wrote the character, he was allowed (with \"Playboy\" substantial budget) to travel for research, photography, and sketching. He followed this with a preliminary script for Hefner, who revised it. Kurtzman then worked out the story's composition, pacing, and action in thumbnail drawings and pencil roughs of each page of the comic, followed by larger, more-detailed layouts on translucent vellum specifying lighting, color, and speech balloon placement. These also required Hefner's approval—a typical two- to seven-page episode would take as many as nine pages of layout. Kurtzman then discussed the layout with Elder, who drove from his home in New Jersey to Kurtzman's in New York. Kurtzman acted out every detail of the strip; according to Elder, \"He would change his voice and take on the characteristics of each role ... We'd crack each other up and fall down laughing.\" This gave Elder what he needed to create the penciling, including \"eye pops\" (background gags worked into blank areas of Kurtzman's layout; Hefner rejected many, so Elder created as many as possible) and the final rendering. Elder painted in oil, tempera, and watercolor, never using ink. Beginning with a white illustration board, Elder explained he would \"pile on\" his oil paint, light colors over dark, then apply tempera, then layer several watercolor washes to give \"Annie\" luminous tones. \"The colors were like gems to me,\" he said. \"I worked very hard to give them iridescence.\" The work was labor-intensive and deadlines were often difficult to meet, so other artists, including Russ Heath, Arnold Roth, Jack Davis, Al Jaffee, Frank Frazetta, and Paul Coker, were occasionally enlisted to help finish the art. Jaffee, a childhood friend of Elder, said about the experience: \"\"Little Annie Fannie\" was the most unique, lavishly produced cartoon cum illustration feature ever. Each panel was a miniature masterpiece that Willie glazed and re-glazed in brilliant watercolor until he reached the level of 3-D-like translucence that he wanted. I know from first-hand experience what went into this project.\" Letterers inked the dialog balloons before Kurtzman cleaned and submitted the finished work. \"Little Annie Fanny\", first comic strip, was the first multi-page comics feature in a major American magazine.\n\nAnnie Fanny is the feature's lead character. Like other young women in \"Playboy\" pictorials, Annie is beautiful, buxom, and often unclothed. She is sexually innocent, oblivious to the worldliness around her. Like her forebear Goodman Beaver, Annie was conceived as a modern Candide, above the story's corruptions and temptations. Unlike Goodman, however, Annie is never shocked or offended; she remains blithe. The authors of \"Icons of the American Comic Book\" say Annie \"glides through a changing world with an untiring optimism\" with a \"good-natured lack of desire\". She is insulated from the carnal nature of those around her, who explain the new rules of society to her each episode. Ruthie, Annie's mother hen roommate, appears in the first episode and remains in the strip throughout its run. Wanda Homefree, Annie Fanny's wild and shapely best friend, first appears in an episode-10 beauty contest as Miss Greenwich Village and is often seen at Annie's side throughout the remainder of the series. Ralphie Towzer, Annie's nerdy-but-hip do-gooder boyfriend, has the look of Goodman Beaver (with playwright Arthur Miller's eyeglasses and pipe) and the temperament of a straight-laced, chastising prude. Solly Brass, Annie's huckster agent, is based on actor Phil Silvers.\n\nA number of other characters in \"Little Annie Fanny\" are derived from Gray's \"Little Orphan Annie\". Sugardaddy Bigbucks, Annie's surrogate father and a powerful, manipulative capitalist, is based on Daddy Warbucks. His mysterious assistant, the Wasp, derives from Warbucks' assistant the Asp, and Punchjab, his bodyguard, comes from the character Punjab. Other supporting characters include ad man Benton Battbarton (whose name is taken from the advertising agencies Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn and Benton & Bowles), Battbarton's rival Huck Buxton (modeled on gap-toothed British actor Terry-Thomas), Duncan Fyfe Hepplewhite (an art plagiarist), and Freddie Flink (who resembles comic actor Fred Gwynne from \"Car 54, Where Are You?\").\n\n\"Little Annie Fanny\" takes the reader through the changing attitudes of American culture, satirizing contemporary trends and fads. In each of the 107 episodes, Annie experiences the latest popular movie, fashion statement, national politics, or society headline. During the strip's first decade, when it ran up to eleven times per year, Annie meets caricatures of the Beatles (who lust for Annie), Sean Connery (playing \"James Bomb\"), reclusive \"Catcher in the Rye\" author J. D. Salinger (as \"Salinger Fiengold\"), NFL champions Green Bay Packers (as the \"Greenback Busters\"), and Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, and Sonny & Cher on the \"Hoopadedoo Show\" (\"Hullabaloo\" show). During these early years, the strip pokes fun at miniskirts, LSD, free love, and bra burning. Background caricatures include Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, prissy-but-powerful J. Edgar Hoover, unisex fashion designer Rudi Gernreich, and the \"Put a Tiger in Your Tank\" ad campaign of Humble Oil. During the 1970s, when the strip ran three to five times per year, Annie sees violent films such as \"A Clockwork Orange\" and \"The French Connection\" and meets sex novelist Philip Roth, consumer advocate Ralph Nader, chess champion Bobby Fischer, and shock rocker Alice Cooper. She experiences disco, streaking, C.B. radio, nudist resorts, and women's liberation. Background \"eye pops\" include Hollywood heavy Charles Bronson, \"Laugh-In\" Arte Johnson, the Avis TV commercial's O. J. Simpson, and \"Star Wars\" C-3PO. In the 1980s, when \"Little Annie Fanny\" appeared once or twice a year, Annie deals with personal computers, goes to \"Urban Cowboy\" Gilley's Club, cruises on \"The Love Boat\", and encounters Indiana Jones, Ayatollah Khomeini, Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, and Woody Allen. Elder's background gags include the Coneheads, Howard Cosell, Miss Piggy, E.T., and Billy Beer.\n\nComics historian Don Markstein said that \"Little Annie Fanny\" \"reached a high point seldom achieved by cartoon art\". Writing for his \"Don Markstein's Toonopedia\" website: \"Harvey Kurtzman ... strove for most of his life to advance the boundaries of comics, not just in terms of storytelling but also in production values\", concluding that \"Little Annie Fanny\" achieved at least the latter. About its venue he said, \"\"Playboy\" magazine, whatever you may say about its content, always did a first-rate job of printing color pictures.\" According to comics commentators Randy Duncan and Matthew J. Smith, the series \"reads today as an amusing look at the evolving mores of the sexual revolution\". Comics editor Monte Beauchamp said that \"Little Annie Fanny\" was \"the most elaborate comic strip ever created\" and cartoonist-critic R. C. Harvey called it \"a masterpiece ... the most lavish color comic strip of all time\".\n\nNot all were as impressed. Noting that Kurtzman was financially strapped before making his living for twenty-six years from \"Playboy\", historian Paul Buhle wrote: \"The strip had many brilliant early moments, but went downhill as the writer and artist bent to editor Hugh Hefner's demands for as much titillation as possible.\" Cartoonist Art Spiegelman said that \"Little Annie Fanny\" devolved from the more interesting Goodman Beaver. Underground cartoonist Robert Crumb, whose career Kurtzman helped launch, scorned \"Playboy\" and \"Annie\". Monty Python's Terry Gilliam, the former assistant editor of \"Help!\", said that \"Little Annie Fanny\" was not as sharp as Kurtzman's earlier work: \"technically brilliant but ... slightly compromised.\" Art agent and publisher Denis Kitchen, who handles Kurtzman and Eisner's estates, said that \"most Kurtzman devotees would not consider \"Little Annie Fanny\" genius work ... [and] some would argue the opposite: that it was genius diluted or degraded\". Kitchen placed the onus on Kurtzman's employer Hefner, who \"was often a punctilious taskmaster with a heavy red pen who often had very different ideas about what was funny or satiric\" and insisted that each strip \"had to include Annie disrobing\". Beauchamp agreed: \"Unfortunately, Hefner was notorious for his heavy editorial hand.\" Duncan and Smith also agreed, and wrote that \"humor sometimes mixes awkwardly with the loaded topics of the era, and some have found Annie's lack of character development and the requisite sexual hijinks an impediment to taking her seriously.\" However, they repeated their respect: \"The eternally innocent Annie performed admirably as a nonjudgmental witness to the changing tides of the sexual revolution.\"\n\nThe December 1978 issue of \"Playboy\" mentioned a \"worldwide search for the actress\" who would \"portray Little Annie Fanny in a live-action movie\". In 2000, Playboy TV approached Mainframe Entertainment to create a CGI animated television series based on \"Little Annie Fanny\", but no series was ever produced.\n\nTwenty-six early episodes of the comic were reprinted in book form by Playboy Press in 1966 and 1972. After Kurtzman's death in 1993, \"Playboy\" revived the comic in 1998 with art by Ray Lago and Bill Schorr, publishing two episodes. Dark Horse Comics collected all episodes of the series and published them in two volumes (2000 and 2001), with annotations by Denis Kitchen and others.\n\n"}

At the time, the president of the Board of Education was Ernest W. Seaholm and the treasurer was Wylie E. Groves. When Birmingham had to build another school to accommodate the incoming baby boomers, these men's names would become the source of the modern names of Birmingham's two main high schools: Seaholm High School and Groves High School.\n\nCompleted in 1959, the building was an example of the International Style applied to ordinary school design, resulting in a modernistic exterior look similar to much subsequent school construction. The building's original architectural \"signature\" was a scalloped circular white roof over the circular library; now painted black, it is visible but no longer prominent. The building has a grid-like floor plan, with three main hallways intersected by six shorter ones. Liberal use was made of glass walls and interior courtyards, with energy costs not yet a major concern in 1959. Since the school's opening, the building has undergone periodic renovations, the most extensive occurring from 1999–2001 when the school was completely remodeled. The school features state of the art technology, including seven computer labs (including one for modern languages) and a large media center; state of the art science labs for biology, chemistry, physics, CAD, and robotics; a little theatre that seats approximately 300; an auditorium that seats approximately 1200; art studios for drawing, photography, jewelry, ceramics, and graphic design; a TV studio; and a large, open commons area where students gather for lunch, dances, and other activities. In 2005, construction began to renovate the athletic wing of the school, as well as to build a new competitive size swimming pool. The former swimming pool has been converted into classrooms, a fitness center, and a dance studio. The school was one of the first schools in Michigan to use artificial \"FieldTurf\" for its football/soccer field. In 2017, there was renovations of the auditorium and construction of a scene shop addition.\n\nThe school opened in the fall of 1959 with 1,052 students in grades seven through ten. Intended eventually to be Birmingham's second high school, it was named after a local civic leader and school board member. In the first year, students selected the school colors (green and white), team nickname (Falcons), fight song (\"Rise Up, All Falcons,\" music and lyrics composed by Mr. Burton Bronson, Groves Band Director), names of the yearbook (\"Talon\") and newspaper (\"Scriptor\"), etc. The original tenth graders became the first class of graduating seniors in 1962. For a brief period the school was a junior and senior high school, and the classes of 1965, 1966 and 1967 spent grades seven through twelve there. Beginning with the 1963-64 school year, grades seven and eight were moved from Groves to Berkshire Middle School, which today serves grades six through eight in the Birmingham City School District. The lower grades were eliminated as new junior high schools were built. This pattern enabled the school district to accommodate, with phased construction, the demographic wave of babyboomers emerging from elementary schools in the late 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe school offers numerous Honors and Advanced Placement courses for students to elect. Advanced Placement is offered for Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Computer Science, Economics, English Language, English Literature, Environmental Science, European History, French, Music Theory, Psychology, Spanish, Statistics, US History, and US Government. The school has a variety of academic elective options for students who do not wish to take Honors or AP courses. The school also offers many courses in journalism, with the newspaper- \"The Scriptor\", the yearbook- \"The Talon\", and the television production- \"The Fann (Falcon Action News Network)\"\n\nThe school offers over thirty varsity sports for both men and women. Most sports are broken down into varsity, junior varsity, and freshmen teams. Groves is a member of the Oakland Activities Association and has won league championships in nearly every sport since the league's inception in 1994. Groves also offers a variety of activities for students to participate in, including instrumental music (both band and orchestra), forensics team, eco club, interact club, fashion club, Amnesty and Animal Rights club, Gay-Straight Alliance club, Japanese club, Spanish club, French club, debate team, theatre, quiz bowl, bowling club, photography club, and the National Honor Society. Both the forensics and debate teams have enjoyed success in recent years. The forensics team finished second in the state in 2007, while the debate team finished first in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.\n\nGroves Student Congress (GSC) is responsible for planning school-wide activities and events such as Spirit Week, Field Day, Extreme Dodgeball, Operation Volleyball, Sadie Hawkins Dance, Wylie's Winter Week, and two blood drives. Members of GSC are elected in school-wide elections. In addition, each class elects its own government, which is responsible for planning class-wide events. Groves students also run their own events independent of the school, including the seniors-only \"Water Wars\" tournament at the end of the year.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Birmingham Unified is a combined team of Groves and Seaholm students\n\n"}

It waged a decades-long campaign to organize J.P. Stevens and other Southern textile manufacturers that achieved some successes.\n\nIn 1901, the United Textile Workers of America (UTW) was formed as an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor (AFL). The UTW, which had its greatest strength in the North, called a strike of textile workers in 1934 to protest worsening working conditions during the Great Depression. The strike was, however, a failure, especially in the South.\n\nIn 1937, the Committee for Industrial Organization (later the Congress of Industrial Organizations or CIO) formed the Textile Workers Organizing Committee (TWOC) as an alternative to the UTW. In 1939, locals from the TWOC and the UTW merged to form the Textile Workers Union of America (TWUA). The TWUA led numerous organizing campaigns in the union-resistant South, aiming to help textile workers achieve higher wages, health insurance and other benefits, and to ensure fair labor practices.\n\nThe TWUA was a leading organization in Operation Dixie, the CIO's post-World War II drive to organize industries in the American South. The unions hoped that by building on the successful organization of wartime industries and using methods proved effective by auto and steel workers, it would be possible to overcome the consequences of the UTW's failed 1934 strike. The TWUA was able to organize new plants and revive some moribund organizations, but was unable to achieve a breakthrough win which would organize the whole industry. Operation Dixie was retired by 1954.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s the TWUA found itself in competition with other unions for representation in large Southern plants. In 1976, the TWUA merged with another garment union, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, to form the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU).\n\nAfter several further mergers, the TWUA's textile locals became part Workers United, a manufacturing and hospitality workers union.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in Armagh, Northern Ireland. It is also the cathedral of the Diocese of Armagh.\n\nThe origins of the cathedral are related to the construction in 445 of a stone church on the Druim Saileach (Willow Ridge) hill by St. Patrick, around which a monastic community developed. The church was historically the centre of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland. The cathedral and its assets were appropriated by the state church, called the Church of Ireland, as part of the Protestant Reformation in Ireland. The English government under King Henry VIII of England transferred the assets. It has remained in Anglican hands since the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England. A Roman Catholic cathedral, also called St Patrick's Cathedral, was built on a neighbouring hill in the nineteenth century. Cordial relations exist between both cathedral chapters.\n\nThe church itself has been destroyed and rebuilt 17 times. The edifice was renovated and restored under Dean Eoghan McCawell (1505-1549) at the start of the sixteenth century having suffered from a devastating fire in 1511 and being in poor shape. Soon after his death the cathedral was described by Lord Chancellor Cusack as ‘one of the fairest and best churches in Ireland’. Again it was substantially restored between 1834 and 1840 by Archbishop Lord John George Beresford and the architect Lewis Nockalls Cottingham. The fabric remains that of the mediaeval building but much restored. While Cottingham was heavy-handed in his restoration, the researches of T. G. F. Patterson and Janet Myles in the late twentieth century have shown the restoration to have been notably antiquarian for its time. The tracery of the nave windows in particular are careful restorations as is the copy of the font. The capital decoration of the two western most pillars of the nave (either side of the West Door internal porch) are mediaeval as are the bulk of the external gargoyle carvings (some resited) of the parapet of the Eastern Arm. Cottingham's intention of retaining the richly-cusped West Door with flanking canopied niches was over-ruled. Subsequent restorations have more radically altered the internal proportions of the mediaeval building, proportions which Cottingham had retained.\n\nMany other Celtic and mediaeval carvings are to be seen within the cathedral which is also rich in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century sculpture. There are works by Francis Leggatt Chantrey, Louis-François Roubiliac, John Michael Rysbrack, Carlo Marochetti and others.\n\nThe Choral Foundation, dating from the Culdees, and refounded as the Royal College of King Charles of Vicars Choral and Organist in the cathedral of Armagh, continues to the present.

Based on the novel by Vereen Bell, it was produced at 20th Century Fox. The film was shot on location at Okefenokee Swamp, Waycross, Georgia, USA. It was Renoir's first American film. The film was remade in 1952 as \"Lure of the Wilderness\", directed by Jean Negulesco.\n\nA local boy, Ben (Dana Andrews) encounters a fugitive Tom Keefer (Walter Brennan) from a murder charge while hunting in the Okefenokee Swamp looking for his dog. The two form a partnership in which Ben sells the animals hunted and trapped by both until townsfolk become suspicious. Also, Ben helps Julie, Keefer's daughter, clean up and look more decent. Keefer is accused of murdering Deputy Shep Collins, but it was really Jesse Wick who did. Ben makes Wick tell on himself so that Keefer will not be blamed anymore. He tries to take Keefer back to town where he can live a normal life, but they are shot at by two people. One of them sinks in quicksand, and Keefer talks to the other man, saying he wants a normal life, and lets him go. Ben and Keefer are later saved by approaching hunters, and in town, Keefer cleans up, and goes to the dance, smiling.\n\n\nThe film was shot on location at Okefenokee Swamp, Waycross, Georgia, and was Renoir's first American film. Renoir found it difficult to adapt to efficient Hollywood shooting standards, insisting on allowing a large number of takes from the actors. Renoir claimed in his autobiography that due to overindulgence he was fired by Zanuck one morning and rehired the same evening.\n\nAlthough Renoir had difficulty adapting to Hollywood production methods, the film was popular at the box office and made a profit. Red River Valley was the main theme song.\n\nDave Kehr of \"The New York Times\" noted that the \"crude wooden cross, planted in a shallow channel and topped with a human skull\" in the film was a \"strikingly morbid image for the usually warm and optimistic Renoir\", and testament to it being a difficult time for him. He concluded that \"Swamp Water\" \"may not represent the film that Renoir wanted to make\", but is \"no less fascinating as the film that Renoir was able to make — at that point in his life and at that point in history\". Jonathan Rosenbaum of \"The New York Times\" concurred, commenting that despite the production setbacks, the film has \"certain beauties and pleasures\". \"Time Out\" thought the film looked \"a bit drab and unbelievable\" despite the location filming, describing it as \"a rather sullen affair set in a Georgia swamp which harbours snakes, alligators, mud, and Walter Brennan, a fugitive criminal with whom the hero (Andrews) becomes strangely and melodramatically involved.\"\n\nFilm critic Raymond Durgnat wrote: \"In certain aspects, \"Swamp Water\" compromises between a Western and \"Toni\". It resembles the former in that violence is consistent and integral rather than spasmodic and, as it were, incidental. Yet the integration of violence and communal emotion is simpler than in the tortuous constructions of William Faulkner.\" Durgnat thought that Anne Baxter's character was reminiscent of Gene Tierney's in \"Tobacco Road\". Several critics, including Dennis Schwartz, noticed that the casting was typical of a John Ford western. Schwartz praised Andrews's performance, but wrote: \"Even though it is only one of Renoir's lesser films, thanks to the interference by Zanuck, it still was one of Fox’s highest grossing films of 1941. But if you ever wondered or cared why so many Hollywood films suck, this film should give you a strong hint why.\" He awarded it a B grade.\n\nThe narrative elements of the 2012 coming-of-age film \"Mud\", directed by Jeff Nichols and starring Matthew McConaughey, have been compared to those of \"Swamp Water\".\n\n"}

The screenplay for the film was written by Ben Hecht, and adapted by Robert E. Kent, Frank P. Rosenberg, and Victor Trivas. The screenplay and adaptations were based on the novel \"Night Cry\" by William L. Stuart. The film stars Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney.\n\nThe film narrative concerns ruthless and cynical Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), a metropolitan police detective, who despises all criminals because his father had been one. Considered a classic of the film noir genre, the film displays a brand of violence, \"lurking below urban society\", that is an important noir motif.\n\nAt a floating crap game in New York City run by gangster Tommy Scalisi (Gary Merrill), the beautiful Morgan Taylor (Gene Tierney) decides to leave for the night, and Texas tycoon Morrison (Harry von Zell) offers to escort her home. Scalisi is clearly upset, as Morrison is up $19,000 at this point. Morrison just says he is in town all week and \"you'll get it back another night\", but Scalisi's associate Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) tells Morgan she has to stay. She realizes he only brought her to the game so Morrison would follow, and now is determined to leave.\n\nPaine slaps Morgan, whereupon Morrison starts a fistfight with Paine. Morrison is knocked out, but when the police arrive he has been stabbed to death.\n\nOne of the police detectives is Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who was just demoted over his heavy use of violence. He hates criminals because his father was one. Two years ago he arrested Scalisi for murder, but Scalisi was acquitted.\n\nScalisi tells several lies about the crime, and implicates Paine. Dixon goes to Paine's apartment and questions him, but Paine becomes angry and they fight briefly. But, unknown to Dixon, a war injury has left Paine with a metal plate in his skull. When he falls, he hits his head and dies.\n\nAfter his recent reprimand, Dixon does not dare report what happened. Borrowing Paine's coat and putting on a bandage where Paine had one on, he lays a false trail suggesting that Paine has left town. Back at Paine's apartment, he is almost seen by Morgan's father, cab driver Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), who arrives and noisily threatens Paine, then leaves when there is no answer. Dixon then takes the body and dumps it in the river. It is soon found, but he suggests that Scalisi murdered Paine as well as Morrison.\n\nAs the case develops, the detectives talk to Morgan and Jiggs Taylor. Morgan is Paine's estranged wife; the night of the murder is the only time she has seen him in months. She and Dixon begin to fall in love. But although Dixon insists that Scalisi is the killer, Jiggs was seen at Paine's apartment and he is arrested. Dixon cannot bear to tell Morgan the truth, but he arranges to pay for a top lawyer for Jiggs, one who has never lost a murder case; however, the lawyer rejects the case, as he thinks he would lose this one.\n\nAfter a fruitless confrontation with Scalisi, Dixon writes a confession, addressing the envelope to Inspector Foley (Robert F. Simon) and marking it \"to be opened in the event of my death\". He then arranges to meet with Scalisi again, fully expecting to be murdered but reasoning that this time Scalisi will be caught for it; but Scalisi has anticipated this, too, and has realized what happened to Paine. He refuses to kill Dixon. Then one of Scalisi's men arrives with the news that the police have beaten the truth about Morrison out of another gang member. As the gang try to escape in a car elevator, Dixon manages to delay them by stalling it until the police arrive.\n\nBack at the 16th Precinct, Foley offers Dixon the unopened letter, but Dixon tells him to read it. Foley arrestes Dixon. Morgan asks why, and Dixon asks Foley to show her the letter. Knowing the truth, she still loves him, and declares confidently that he will not be punished for the accidental death.\n\n\n\n\"Where the Sidewalk Ends\" is the last film that Otto Preminger would make as a director-for-hire for Twentieth Century Fox in the 1940s. The series includes \"Laura,\" which also stars Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, \"Whirlpool,\" and \"Fallen Angel\".\n\nFilming locations\nThe film was primarily shot on a studio set, but the filmmakers also shot a few scenes at actual New York City locations.\n\nMost critics compare the film unfavorably to Preminger's earlier film \"Laura\" which used much of the same talent as this film. According to film writers, this film, a grittier \"noir\", does succeed in showing a darker side of police similar to the film noirs that follow it.\n\n\"The New York Times\" film critic, Bosley Crowther, while thinking the script was too far-fetched, liked the way the dialogue was written, and the acting as well. He wrote, \"...the plausibility of the script by Ben Hecht, an old hand with station houses and sleazy underworldlings, is open to question on several counts. Not so, however, his pungent dialogue and unfolding of the plot, which Otto Preminger, who guided the same stars through \"Laura\" several seasons back, has taken to like a duck to water and kept clipping along crisply till the fadeout.\"\n\nThe staff at \"Variety\" magazine praised the direction of the film. They wrote, \"Otto Preminger, director, does an excellent job of pacing the story and of building sympathy for Andrews.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" called the film \"one of the most taut and absorbing crime melodramas produced in many a moon,\" with \"exceptionally good\" dialogue. John McCarten of \"The New Yorker\", however, only deemed it to be \"a fair-to-middling-melodrama.\"\n\nAccording to Boris Trbic, scriptwriter and media instructor, \"Where the Sidewalk Ends\" reflects a specific phase in the development of the film noir style. The large film production companies in the early 1950s backed away from the social-problem drama, and instead made \"low-budget and low-risk thrillers\" such as: \"Panic in the Streets\", \"No Way Out\", this film, and others. As such, they avoided the \"wrath of conservative critics and social watchdogs.\"\n\nThe Academy Film Archive preserved \"Where the Sidewalk Ends\" in 2004.\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Eton. He became a professional soldier and rose to the rank of general. As Marquess of Huntly, he served with the guards in Flanders from 1793 to 1794. He commanded the 92nd Highlanders, which was originally raised by his father the Alexander Gordon as the 100 Regiment of Foot 1794 and renumbered in 1798, and commanded the regiment in Spain, Corsica, Ireland and the Netherlands from 1795 to 1799, where he was badly wounded. He commanded a division in the Walcheren Expedition of 1809.\n\nHe was a freemason and was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland from 1792 to 1794. He was Member of Parliament for Eye from 1806 to 1807. On 11 April 1807, at the age of 37, he was summoned to the House of Lords in one of the minor peerages of his father (Baron Gordon of Huntley, co. Gloucester). He was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1830, was Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland from 1828 to 1830 (a post that his father had held until 1827), and from 1827 to 1836 was Governor of Edinburgh Castle.\n\nHe married at Bath, on 11 December 1813, Elizabeth Brodie, who was twenty-four years his junior. Brodie was the daughter of Alexander Brodie of Arnhall in Kincardineshire. Elizabeth Grant described her thus:\nHowever, at the time of his marriage and, in fact, until he inherited the Dukedom, George found himself in almost constant financial difficulties. He was referred to as \"Lord Huntly now in the decline of his rackety life, overwhelmed with debts, sated with pleasure, tired of fashion, the last heir male of the Gordon line\". While his marriage remedied some of these problems, it did not supply the much sought-after heir.\n\nLike his father, George acquired many of the positions which the Gordon family could expect almost as of right. These included the posts of Lord Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire, Chancellor of Marischal College, Aberdeen and Lord High Constable of Scotland. He held the latter post of Lord High Constable for the coronation of King George IV in 1820.\n\nBy the time of his succession to the dukedom, he had established a reputation as an extreme reactionary. He steadfastly opposed the Great Reform Bill and when the majority of Tory Peers opted to abstain, he remained one of the twenty-two \"Stalwarts\" who voted against the Third Reading of the Bill in the House of Lords on 4 June 1832.\n\nThroughout much of this period, his wife served Queen Adelaide at court. Indeed, she was given the Queen's coronation robe, which is now to be found with many other Gordon memorabilia at Brodie Castle.\n\nNathaniel Parker Willis, the American journalist, has left us with an interesting account of life at Gordon Castle in the twilight years of the 5th Duke's life. He described the \"canonically fat porter\" at the lodges who admitted him to a \"rich private world peopled by ladies cantering sidesaddle on palfreys, ladies driving nowhere in particular in phaetons, gentlemen with guns, keepers with hounds and terrier at heel, and everywhere a profusion of fallow deer, hares and pheasants. At the castle a dozen lounging and powdered menials.\" Willis continued: \"I never realised so forcibly the splendid results of wealth and primogeniture.\" Just before dinner the Duke called at his room, \"an affable white-haired gentleman of noble physiognomy, but singularly cordial address, wearing a broad red ribbon across his breast, and led him through files of servants to a dining room ablaze with gold plate.\"\n\nThe Duke died at Belgrave Square, London, on 28 May 1836, aged 66. The Dukedom of Gordon became extinct, but the Marquessate of Huntly (created in 1599) passed to his distant cousin the Earl of Aboyne while the Gordon estates passed to his nephew, Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond. The Gordon \"moveable\" property was left by the Duchess to the Brodies of Brodie.\n\nElizabeth Brodie, the last Duchess of Gordon, retired to Huntly Castle Lodge, where she became more fervently religious than she had previously been until her death on 31 January 1864, when the last trace of the original Dukedom of Gordon was also extinguished.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Gordon established the Gordon Chapel (Scottish Episcopal Church) in Fochabers that contains a memorial tablet to the 5th and last Duke.\n\nThe Duke had three illegitimate children: Charles Gordon, Susan Sordet, and Georgiana McCrae.\n\n"}

In 1986, he formed a tag team called The Nasty Boys with Jerry Sags and wrestled in the Tennessee territory until they moved to Florida Championship Wrestling, where they won five Tag Team titles from 1988 through 1990.\n\nIn 1990, they went to the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)'s Jim Crockett Promotions, which had been purchased by Ted Turner and would be renamed World Championship Wrestling (WCW) before The Nasty Boys left a few months later. They feuded with Rick and Scott Steiner over the WCW United States Tag Team Championship, but could not defeat them. Later that year, they went to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) where they were managed by Jimmy Hart. They won the World Tag Team Title from The Hart Foundation before feuding with and losing the title to the Legion of Doom. The Nasty Boys then wrestled many of the WWF's top face teams, including The Rockers, The Bushwhackers, and High Energy, before turning face in the fall of 1992 to feud with Hart's Money Inc. over the tag team title, which they were unable to regain.\n\nThey left the WWF for WCW in 1993 and were quickly placed with manager Missy Hyatt, who led them to the WCW World Tag Team Championship. After she left them, they feuded with Harlem Heat, The Blue Bloods, and the team of Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck. They won the tag team title a second time later in 1993, but they were defeated by Cactus Jack and Kevin Sullivan the following year. In May 1995, they defeated Harlem Heat for their third and final WCW tag title at Slamboree, but lost the belts back to Harlem Heat on a late-June episode of WCW Worldwide. In 1996, they were tricked by the nWo into thinking they were going to become members, but were attacked as soon as they received their shirts. Sags had been injured previously in a shoot altercation with Scott Hall and had to retire due to this injury.\n\nFollowing Sags' retirement, Knobbs left WCW and became a singles wrestler. When he returned to WCW. Knobbs entered WCW's hardcore division. He feuded with Norman Smiley and defeated Bam Bam Bigelow at SuperBrawl in 2000. In addition, he won the WCW Hardcore Championship three times. He lost the belt simultaneously to all three members of the boy band stable Three Count, but he regained it from them later. Fit Finlay was briefly his manager as the Hardcore Soldiers with partner The Dog. He also was briefly in Jimmy Hart's The First Family.\n\nAfter leaving WCW, Knobbs has since returned to wrestling, including wrestling at the New Alhambra Arena (formerly the ECW Arena) for Pro Wrestling Unplugged on June 16, 2007. On November 20, 2007, Knobbs and Sags reformed as The Nasty Boys, performing in a dark match at the SmackDown! tapings from Tampa, Florida to wrestle their first WWE match in years. According to reports, the match was disastrous, and the team were accused of unprofessionally working stiff with their opponents, Dave Taylor and Drew McIntyre. Knobbs and Saggs won the match.\n\nOn January 4, 2010, The Nasty Boys made an appearance on Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's television show, \"TNA Impact!\", starting a feud with Team 3D. On the January 21 edition of \"Impact!,\" the Nasty Boys competed in their first match for TNA, defeating the team of Eric Young and Kevin Nash. At Against All Odds The Nasty Boys defeated Team 3D in a tag team match, when Jimmy Hart made his return to the company and interfered in the match on the Nasty Boys' behalf. On the February 25 edition of \"Impact!,\" Team 3D defeated the Nasty Boys in a tables match, when Jesse Neal interfered on Team 3D's behalf. The Nasty Boys and Hart continued their feud with Team 3D by defeating them and the returning Brother Runt, a replacement for Jesse Neal, whom the Nastys attacked prior to the match, in a six-man tag team match. After the match Neal attacked the Nastys and helped Team 3D put Sags through a table. On March 29, 2010, news broke that the Nasty Boys had been released by TNA following an incident at a TNA function with Spike executives present.\n\nIn February 2012, Knobbs was reportedly involved in an altercation with fellow wrestler New Jack, with New Jack allegedly knocking out Knobbs.\n\nKnobbs has been married to Toni (Greg Valentine's wife's sister) since January 1994. The couple have 1 child. He is a close friend of Hulk Hogan. In recent years he has been bothered with knee issues. In 2019 he was in hospital with a blood infection. His medical bills were paid by fans through a GoFundMe campaign.\n\nKnobbs has appeared in several episodes of \"Hogan Knows Best\" and \"Brooke Knows Best\", and was an on-screen trainer for \"Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling\" and \"Hulk Hogan's Micro Championship Wrestling\".\n\nDuring the 2009 Major League Baseball season, Knobbs performed a \"Pit Stop\" on Raymond, the Tampa Bay Rays mascot.

In an interview appearing on The Criterion Collection DVD release, Dassin recalls that the casting of Tierney was in response to a request by Darryl Zanuck, who was concerned that personal problems had rendered the actress \"suicidal,\" and hoped that work would improve her state of mind. The film's British version was five minutes longer, with a more upbeat ending and featuring a completely different film score. Dassin endorsed the American version as closer to his vision.\n\nThe film contains a very tough and prolonged fight scene between Stanislaus Zbyszko, a celebrated professional wrestler in real life, and Mike Mazurki, who before becoming an actor was himself a professional wrestler.\n\nHarry Fabian (Widmark) is an ambitious American hustler and con man operating in London, always looking for a better deal.

While attempting a con at a wrestling match, Fabian witnesses Gregorius (Zbyszko), a veteran Greek wrestler, arguing with his son Kristo (Lom), who has organised the fight, and who effectively controls all wrestling in London. After denouncing Kristo's event as tasteless exhibitionism that shames the sport's Greco-Roman traditions, Gregorius leaves with Nikolas (Richmond), a fellow wrestler. Fabian catches up with the two and befriends them, having realised that he can host wrestling in London without interference from Kristo if he can persuade his father to support the enterprise.\n\nFabian approaches Phil and Helen with his proposal, then asks for an investment. Incredulous, Phil offers to provide half of the required £400, if Fabian can equal it. Desperate, Fabian asks Figler, a panhandler and unofficial head of an informal society of street criminals, Googin, a forger, and Anna, a Thameside smuggler, but none can offer any help. Fabian is eventually approached by Helen, who offers the £200 in exchange for a licence to continue running her own nightclub, having obtained the money by selling an expensive fur Phil recently bought for her. Fabian agrees, but tricks Helen by having Googin forge the licence. Meanwhile, Phil is visited by associates of Kristo, who warn him to keep Fabian away from London's wrestling scene. Already suspecting Helen of duplicity, Phil neglects to warn Fabian, who proceeds to open his own gym with Gregorius and Nikolas as the stars, and Phil as a silent partner.\n\nA furious Kristo visits the gym, only to discover that his father is supporting Fabian's endeavour. Meeting with Phil, the two plot to kill Fabian, but realise that they can only do so if Gregorius leaves Fabian. Phil meets with Fabian and removes his backing, suggesting that Fabian get Nikolas and The Strangler (Mazurki), a showy wrestler favoured by Kristo, into the ring together to keep the business going, knowing that Gregorius would never allow it. Finding The Strangler's manager, Mickey Beer (Farrell), Fabian convinces him to support the fight, and taunts The Strangler into confronting Gregorius and Nikolas. Gregorius agrees to the fight, convinced by Fabian that it will prove that his style of wrestling is superior. Beer asks Fabian for £200 to cover his fee, so Fabian asks Phil for the money. Instead, Phil calls Kristo, informing him that The Strangler is in Fabian's gym.\n\nBetrayed, Fabian steals the money from Mary, and returns to the gym. However, The Strangler goads Gregorius into a prolonged and brutal fight, during which Nikolas' wrist is broken. Gregorius eventually defeats The Strangler in the ring as Kristo arrives, but dies minutes later in his son's arms from exhaustion. Seeing that both his business and protection are lost, Fabian flees.\n\nIn revenge of his father's death, Kristo puts a £1,000 bounty on Fabian's head, sending word to all of London's underworld. Fabian is hunted through the night, first by Kristo's men, then by Figler, who attempts to trap Fabian for the reward. Convinced that her licence is authentic, Helen leaves Phil, only to discover that the work is a worthless forgery. She returns to Phil in desperation, only to discover that he has committed suicide, leaving everything to Molly (Reeve), the club's elderly cleaner and flower stand operator.\n\nFabian eventually finds shelter at Anna's, but has already been tracked down by Kristo. Mary arrives, and Fabian attempts to redeem himself by shouting to Kristo that Mary betrayed him, so that she will get the reward. As he runs towards where Kristo is standing on Hammersmith Bridge, he is caught and killed by The Strangler, who throws his body into the Thames. The Strangler is arrested moments later, and Kristo walks away from the scene.\n\n\nThe film has been noted as ground breaking in its lack of sympathetic characters, the deadly punishment of its protagonist (in the American version), and especially in its realistic portrayal of triumph by racketeers neither slowed nor at all worried by the machinations of law. Critics of the time did not react well; typical was Bosley Crowther's review in \"The New York Times\", which read in part,[Dassin's] evident talent has been spent upon a pointless, trashy yarn, and the best that he has accomplished is a turgid pictorial grotesque...he tried to bluff it with a very poor script—and failed...[the screenplay] is without any real dramatic virtue, reason or valid story-line...little more than a melange of maggoty episodes having to do with the devious endeavors of a cheap London night-club tout to corner the wrestling racket—an ambition in which he fails. And there is only one character in it for whom a decent, respectable person can give a hoot.\n\nThe film was first re-evaluated in the 1960s, as film noir became a celebrated genre, and it has continued to receive laudatory reviews to date. Writing for \"Slant Magazine,\" Nick Schager said,Jules Dassin's 1950 masterpiece was his first movie after being exiled from America for alleged communist politics, and the unpleasant ordeal seems to have infused his work with a newfound resentment and pessimism, as the film—about foolhardy scam-artist Harry Fabian (Richard Widmark) and his ill-advised attempts to become a big shot—brims with anger, anxiousness, and a shocking dose of unadulterated hatred.\n\nIn \"The Village Voice\", film critic Michael Atkinson wrote, \"...the movie's a moody piece of Wellesian chiaroscuro (shot by Max Greene, né Mutz Greenbaum) and an occasionally discomfiting underworld plunge, particularly when the mob-controlled wrestling milieu explodes into a kidney-punching donnybrook.\"\n\nIn \"Street with No Name: A History of the Classic American Film Noir\" film critic Andrew Dickos acclaims it as one of the seminal noirs of the classical period. noting, \"... in a perfect fusion of mood and character, Dassin created a work of emotional power and existential drama that stands as a paradigm of noir pathos and despair.\"\n\nThe Academy Film Archive preserved \"Night and the City\" in 2004.\n\nThe British Lion Film Production Disc collection at the British Library includes music from the film soundtrack of \"Night and the City\" on which Adelaide Hall is featured. These rare discs are stored at the British Library, London, and can be heard by the public upon request.\n\nThe film was released in DVD Region 1 in February 2005 as part of The Criterion Collection and in Region 2 by the BFI in October 2007. Both discs contained the US version only. Criterion reissued their DVD as a 2-disc edition, now containing both the US and UK versions, alongside a new Blu-ray in August 2015. In September 2015 the BFI also released the film on Blu-ray, again containing both versions.\n\n\"Night and the City\", a 1992 film starring Robert De Niro, was based on it.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1934994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934994", "title": "Soviet espionage in the United States", "text": "Soviet espionage in the United States\n\nSince the late 1920s, the Soviet Union, through its GRU, OGPU and NKVD intelligence services, used Russian and foreign-born nationals as well as Communist, and people of American origin to perform espionage activities in the United States. These various espionage networks had contact with various U.S. government agencies, transmitting to Moscow information that would have been deemed confidential.\n\nDuring the 1920s Soviet intelligence focused on military and industrial espionage in Britain, France, Germany, and the United States, specifically in the aircraft and munitions industries, in order to industrialize and compete with Western powers, as well as strengthening the Soviet armed forces.\n\nOne chief aim was the infiltration, placement, and subversion of American political life at all levels of society in what KGB defectors from the Soviet Union described as their active measures and psychological warfare assignment; accounting for 85% of all KGB activities. The processes is identified by Yuri Bezmenhof, a defector from the Soviet KGB, who put the process into the four stages \"destabilize, demoralize, crisis, normalization\" where an enemy country would be transitioned to communism over several decades. Earl Browder, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), served as an agent recruiter himself on behalf of Soviet intelligence.\n\nBrowder later stated that \"by the mid-thirties, the Party was not putting its principal emphasis on recruiting members.\" Left unstated was his intent to use party members for espionage work, where suitable. Browder advocated the use of a \"United Front\" involving other members of the left, both to strengthen advocacy of pro-Soviet policy and to enlarge the pool of potential recruits for espionage work. The illegal residency of NKVD in the US was established in 1934 by the former Berlin resident Boris Bazarov. In 1935, NKVD agent Iskhak Akhmerov entered the US with false identity papers to assist Bazarov in the collection of useful intelligence, and operated without interruption until 1939, when he left the US. Akhmerov's wife, an American who worked for Soviet intelligence, was Helen Lowry (Elza Akhmerova), the niece of CPUSA General Secretary Earl Browder. Recent information from Soviet archives has revealed that Browder's younger sister Marguerite worked until 1938 as an NKVD operative in Europe. She discontinued this work only when Browder himself requested her release from duty, fearful that her work would compromise his position as General Secretary.\n\nIn the 1930s, the chief Soviet espionage organization operating in the U.S. became the GRU. J. Peters headed the secret apparatus that supplied internal government documents from the Ware group to the GRU. Browder assisted Peters in building a network of operatives in the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This group included Alger Hiss, John Abt, and Lee Pressman. Courier for the group at the time was Whittaker Chambers. Browder oversaw the efforts of Jacob Golos and his girlfriend, Elizabeth Bentley, whose network of agents and sources included two key figures at the Department of Treasury, Nathan Gregory Silvermaster and Harry Dexter White.\n\nOne early Soviet spy ring was headed by Jacob Golos. Jake Golos (birth name Jacob Golosenko, Tasin, Rasin or Raisen) was a Ukrainian-born Bolshevik revolutionary and Soviet secret police (NKVD) operative in the USSR. He was also a longtime senior official of the CPUSA involved in covert work and cooperation with Soviet intelligence agencies. He took over an existing network of agents and intelligence sources from Earl Browder. Golos' controller was the head of the NKVD's American desk, Gaik Ovakimian, also known as \"The Puppetmaster\", who would later serve a key role in the assassination of Leon Trotsky. Golos was the \"main pillar\" of the NKVD intelligence network. He had worked with Soviet intelligence from the mid-1930s, and probably earlier. He was not merely a CPUSA official assisting the NKVD (an agent or \"probationer\" in Soviet intelligence parlance) but held official rank in the NKVD, and claimed to be an oldtime Chekist.\n\nGolos established a company called \"World Tourists\" with money from Earl Browder, the General Secretary. The firm, which posed as a travel agency, was used to facilitate international travel to and from the United States by Soviet agents and CPUSA members. World Tourists was also involved in manufacturing fake passports, as Browder used such a false passport on covert trips to the Soviet Union in 1936. At World Tourist, Golos frequently met Bernard Schuster, an NKVD agent (code name \"ECHO\" and \"DICK\") and Communist Party functionary who carried out background investigations for Golos as part of the vetting process of agent candidates. In March 1940, Golos pleaded guilty to being an unregistered foreign agent, paid a $500 fine (equivalent to $ today), and served probation in lieu of a four-month prison sentence.\n\nSoviet intelligence did not like Golos' refusal to allow Soviet contact with his sources (a measure implemented by Golos to protect himself and to ensure his continued retention by the NKVD). The NKVD suspected Golos of Trotskyism and tried to lure him to Moscow, where he could be arrested, but the US government got to him first. But even then, he did not reveal his agent network. After Browder went to prison in 1940, Golos took over running Browder's agents. In 1941, Golos set up a commercial forwarding enterprise, called the US Shipping and Service Corporation, with Elizabeth Bentley, his lover, as one of its officers.\n\nSometime in November 1943, Golos met in New York City with key figures of the Perlo group, a group working in several government departments and agencies in Washington, D.C. The group was already in the service of Browder. Later that same month, after a series of heart attacks over the previous two years, Golos died in bed in Bentley's arms. Bentley then took over his operations (thus the reference in the decrypts to him as a \"former\" colleague).\n\nBy the end of 1936 at least four mid-level State Department officials were delivering information to Soviet intelligence: Alger Hiss, assistant to Assistant Secretary of State Francis Sayre; Julian Wadleigh, economist in the Trade Agreements Section; Laurence Duggan, Latin American division; and Noel Field, West European division. Whittaker Chambers later testified that the plans for a tank design with a revolutionary new suspension invented by J. Walter Christie (then being tested in the U.S.A.) were procured and put into production in the Soviet Union as the Mark BT, later developed into the famous Soviet T-34 tank.\n\nIn 1993, experts from the Library of Congress traveled to Moscow to copy previously secret archives of Communist Party USA (CPUSA) records, sent to the Soviet Union for safekeeping by party organizers. The records provide an irrefutable record of Soviet intelligence and cooperation provided by those in the radical left in the United States from the 1920s through the 1940s. Some documents revealed that the CPUSA was actively involved in secretly recruiting party members from African-American groups and rural farm workers. The records contained further evidence that Soviet sympathizers had indeed infiltrated the State Department, beginning in the 1930s. Included were letters from two U.S. ambassadors in Europe to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and a senior State Department official. Thanks to an official in the State department sympathetic to the Party, the confidential correspondence, concerning political and economic matters in Europe, ended up in the hands of Soviet intelligence.\n\nIn the late 1930s and 1940 the OGPU, known as the Political Directorate, used the U.S. as one of several staging areas for multiple OGPU plots to murder exiled Soviet leader Leon Trotsky, then living in Mexico City. It was American Communists who infiltrated Trotsky's killer, the Catalan Ramón Mercader, into his own household. They were also central to the NKVD's unsuccessful efforts to free the killer from a Mexican prison. \n\nJacob Albam and the Sobles (Jack and Myra) were indicted on espionage charges by the FBI in 1957; all three were later convicted and served prison terms. The Zlatovskis remained in Paris, France, where the laws did not allow their extradition to the United States for espionage. Robert Soblen was sentenced to life in prison for his espionage work at Sandia National Laboratories, but jumped bail and escaped to Israel. After being expelled from that country, he later committed suicide in Great Britain while awaiting extradition back to the United States.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Soviet espionage agents obtained classified reports on electronic advances in radio-beacon artillery fuses by Emerson Radio, including a complete proximity fuse (reportedly the same fuse design that was later installed on Soviet anti-aircraft missiles to shoot down Francis Gary Powers's U-2 in 1960). Thousands of documents from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) were photocopied or stolen, including a complete set of design and production drawings for Lockheed Aircraft's new P-80 Shooting Star fighter jet.\n\nJoseph Stalin directed Soviet intelligence officers to collect information in four main areas. Pavel Fitin, the 34-year-old chief of the KGB First Directorate, was directed to seek American intelligence concerning Hitler's plans for the war in Russia; secret war aims of London and Washington, particularly with regard to planning for Operation Overlord, the second front in Europe; any indications the Western Allies might be willing to make a separate peace with Hitler; and American scientific and technological progress, particularly in the development of an atomic weapon.\n\nThe United States Treasury Department was successfully penetrated by nearly a dozen Soviet agents or information sources, including Harold Glasser and his superior, Harry Dexter White, assistant secretary of the treasury and the second most influential official in the department. In late May 1941, Vitaly Pavlov, a 25-year-old NKVD officer, approached White and attempted to secure his assistance to influence U.S. policy towards Japan. White agreed to assist Soviet intelligence in any way he could. The principal function of White was to aid in the infiltration and placement of Soviet operatives within the government, and protecting sources. When security concerns arose around Nathan Gregory Silvermaster, White protected him in his sensitive position at the Board of Economic Warfare. White likewise was a purveyor of information and resources to assist Soviet aims, and agreed to press for the release of German occupation currency plates to the Soviet Union. The Soviets later used the plates to print unrestricted sums of money to exchange for U.S. and Allied hard goods.\n\nIn August 1945, Elizabeth Bentley, fearful of assassination by the Soviet MGB, turned herself in to the government. She implicated many agents and sources in the Golos and Silvermaster spy networks, and was the first to accuse Harry Dexter White of acting on behalf of Soviet interests in releasing occupation plates to Moscow, later confirmed by Soviet archives and former KGB officers.\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 9835 of 22 March 1947 tightened protections against subversive infiltration of the US Government, defining disloyalty as membership on a list of subversive organizations maintained by the Attorney General. Truman, however, was opposed to the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950, calling it a \"Mockery of the Bill of Rights\" and a \"long step towards totalitarianism\".\n\n\n"}

These terms are most commonly used in reference to Scotch whisky, or whisky in that style, such as Japanese whisky.\n\nThe legally anachronistic term \"vatted\" was used to describe the blending process but does not automatically equate to creation of a vatted malt. Likewise, the use of the term \"blended\" did not necessarily refer to the creation of what is typically referred to as a blended whisky. A blending of different casks or batches of single malt whisky produced from the same distillery is still considered a single malt whisky.\n\nThe \"malt\" part of the term refers to the use of a malted grain to make the whisky. In Scotch whisky, this grain is required to be barley. Outside Scotland, whisky is produced from other malted grains, such as malted rye, and the term \"rye malt whisky\" is specifically recognized along with (barley-based) \"malt whisky\" in the code of federal regulations for whisky in the United States. Moreover, in much of the world, whisky is often made using grain that is not malted (for example, using a corn mash). In practice, unless a different grain is specifically mentioned, a \"malt\" whisky is assumed to be made from barley.\n\nIn the case of Scotch whisky, blended malts do not contain any whisky made from grains other than barley or spirits distilled using continuous distillation, unlike products labelled as \"blended whisky\". For the Scotch whisky industry, the terms \"vatted malt\" or \"pure malt\" have been reclassified as \"blended malts\" per the Scotch Whisky Regulations of 2009, and it has become unlawful to label Scotch Whisky using the prior terminology. When an age statement appears on the label of a Scotch blended malt whisky (or any other Scotch whisky), it refers to the amount of time spent in wooden aging casks for the \"youngest\" (i.e., the least aged) whisky used in the product.\n"}

He was the fifth son of sixth Mughal emperor Aurangzeb through a Georgian concubine Udaipuri Mahal. He was circumcised on 23 March 1673.\n\nOn 2 February 1681, he married Fakhr Jahan Khanam, daughter of Barkhurdar Beg, a mansabdar. Later that year, on 9 August, he married Jamilat-un-nisa Begum née Kalyan Kaur alias Manoharpuri Mahal, daughter of Amar Chand, and sister of Jagat Singh of Manoharpur. The Qazi tied the knot in the mosque of khas and am. The dowry was 50,000 rupees. \n\nHis third wife was Azarm Banu Begum, daughter of Muazzam Sayadat Khan, whom he married on 14 March 1683. Khidmatgar Khan conveyed to the Prince's house a special robe with half sleeves woven with pearls, and Khidmat Khan jewels worth rupees two lakhs and 26,000 rupees. Cash of five lakh rupees, two Arab and Iraqi horses, and an elephant were presented to Aurangzeb. The knot was tied in the mosque in the presence of the Qazi Shaikh-ul-Islam. A grand and joyous festivity marked the occasion. She died at Delhi on 13 February 1745.\n\nHis sons were Umaid Bakhsh Mirza, Muhammad Muhi-us-Sunnat Mirza, Muhammad Firuzmand Mirza, and Bariqu'llah Mirza. He had also a daughter, who was married on 20 November 1709 to Muhammad Karim Mirza, son of Azim-us-Shan Mirza.\n\nAfter Aurangzeb's death, Kam Bakhsh marched towards Bijapur in March 1707 with his soldiers. When the news of his death spread through the city, the king Sayyid Niyaz Khan surrendered the fort to him. Upon ascending the throne, he made Ahsan Khan the \"bakshi\" or the chief general with the post of chief minister going to Taqarrub Khan. He also gave himself the title of Padshah Kam Bakhsh-i-Dinpanah (Emperor Kam Bakhsh, Protector of Faith). He went on to conquer Gulbarga and Wakinkhera.\n\nIn the meantime, a conflict arose among Taqarrub Khan and Ahsan Khan. Ahsan Khan had created a market place in Bijapur where he took the decision of not levying tax on shops, without taking the permission of Kam Bakhsh. Taqarrub Khan reported it to him, who ordered this practise to be stopped. In May of the same year, Ahsan Khan was sent by Kam Bakhsh to conquer the states of Golconda and Hyderabad. The king of Golconda refused to surrender but the subahdar of Hyderabad, Rustam Dil Khan agreed to give his province to him.\n\nEnvious of the progress of Ahsan Khan, Taqarrub Khan decided to suppress him. He joined hands with Sayyid Ahmed for the cause. He purposely misinterpreted the private meetings of Ahsan Khan, Saif Khan (the archery teacher of Kam Bakhsh), Arsan Khan, Ahmad Khan and Nasir Khan along with Rustam Dil Khan to discuss public business as finding a way to kill Kam Bakhsh. Taqarrub Khan said him that they would assassinate him \"while on his way to the Friday prayer at the great mosque\". He called Rustam Dil Khan for dinner, and while he came, the royal soldiers arrested him, and he was killed by crushing him under the feet of an elephant. Saif Khan's hands were amputated and Arshad Khan's tongue was cut off as punishment. In spite of his close mates warning him of Kam Bakhsh arresting him, Ahsan Khan paid no heed to it. But he was also put in custody and his goods were confiscated. In April 1708, Shah's envoy, Maktabar Khan came to his court. Taqarrub Khan said to him that his original intention was to dethrone him. So Kam Bakhsh, called him and his entourage in a feast, where he asked his men to execute them.\n\nAfter ascending the throne by defeating Muhammad Azam Shah at the battle of Jajau in 1707, Bahadur Shah I ascended the throne. In May 1708, Shah wrote a letter to Kam Bakhsh informing him of the happenings. Shah I thought that this incident would \"be a warning\" to him, so that he could not declare himself an independent sovereign. In that same month, he started his journey for the Tomb of Aurangzeb to pay respect to the departed emperor. In reply he wrote a letter thanking him \"without either explaining or justifying it\".\n\nWhen Shah reached Hyderabad on 28 June 1708, he received the news of Kam Bakhsh attacking Machhlibandar. Actually, there were thirty-two lakhs of treasure hidden in the fort which he wanted to seize for further campaigns. The \"subahdar\" of the province Jan Sipar Khan refused to hand over the money. Enraged by the refusal, he confiscated the property and ordered that four thousand men to be recruited for the attack. In the following month, the garrison of the Gulbarga fort revolted against him and declared themselves to be free. The leader of the garrison Daler Khan Bijapuri \"reported his desertion from Kam Bakhsh\". On 5 November 1708, Shah's camp reached Bidar which is 67 miles north from Hyderabad. Historian William Irvine writes that as his \"camp drew nearer desertions from Kam Bakhsh became more and more frequent\". On 1 November Kam Bakhsh captured Pam Naik's (the zamindar of Wakinkhera) belongings after he had left his army.\n\nIrvine writes that as more and more soldiers left his service as Shah's camp was coming nearer. When his general informed him that the non-payment of salary to his soldiers was responsible for the soldiers deserting him, he replied that: \"What need have I of enlisting them? My trust is in God, and whatever is best will happen.\"\n\nShah thought that in such a bankrupt condition, Kam Bakhsh might flee to Persia. On his orders, the Mughal prime minister Zulfikar Khan signed a pact with a certain Mr.Pitt, the governor of Madras that he would be paid two lakh rupees if he could capture Kam Bakhsh, in case he tries to flee. Records show that on 20 December, he had twenty five hundred cavalry and five thousand infantry.\n\nOn 20 December 1708, Kam Bakhsh marched towards Talab-i-Mir Jumla, on the outskirts Hyderabad with \"three hundred camels, twenty thousand rockets\" for the war against Bahadur Shah I. Shah made his son Jahandar Shah the commander of the vanguard, but was replaced by Khan Zaman. On 12 January 1709, Shah finally reached Hyderabad and set up his tent training his troops. With little money and soldiers left, Kam Bakhsh was sure of his victory due to the foretelling of the royal astrologer who predicted that he would \"miraculously\" win the battle.\n\nOn 13 January, Shah's army charged towards him. The troops were divided in two bodies – one was under the commandant of Mumin Khan and was assisted by Rafi-ush-Shan and Jahan Shah and the second under Zulfikar Khan. There were an estimation of fifteen thousand soldiers in Shah's army. After two hours from sunrise, the emperor's troops surrounded Kam Bakhsh's camp. Being impatient, Khan attacked him with his \"small force\".\n\nWith his soldiers being outnumbered and unable to resist the attack, Kam Bakhsh himself started shooting arrows at the enemy, finishing two quiverfuls of arrows. Irvine writes that when he was \"weakened by loss of blood\" the opposition surrounded him and took him and his son Bariqullah as prisoners. However a dispute rose among Mumin Khan and Zulfikar Khan about who had actually captured him. Rafi-us-Shan solved the matter by attributing it to the latter.\n\nHe was taken by a palanquin to Shah's camp where he was made to rest on a bed. Shah went to his bedside and said \"I had no desire to see you reduced to this state\". Shah himself also washed the wounds from his body and replaced his blood stained clothes, besides forcing him to take \"few spoonfuls of food\". The next morning on 14 January 1709, Kam Bakhsh died. After ten days, his body was sent to Delhi for burial, and was hence buried in Humayun's Tomb.\n\n"}

{"id": "1935047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935047", "title": "St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh (Roman Catholic)", "text": "St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh (Roman Catholic)\n\nSt. Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh, Northern Ireland is the seat of the Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, Primate of All Ireland. It was built in various phases between 1840 and 1904 to serve as the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Archdiocese of Armagh, the original Medieval Cathedral of St. Patrick having been appropriated by the state church called the Church of Ireland at the time of the Irish Reformation. \n\nThe Cathedral stands on a hill, as does its Anglican counterpart.\n\nThe building of a Catholic cathedral at Armagh was a task imbued with great historic and political symbolism. Armagh was the Primatial seat of Ireland and its ancient ecclesiastical capital. Yet, since the Irish Reformation under Henry VIII, no Catholic Archbishop had resided there. Since the seventeenth century, the majority Catholic population of Ireland had lived under the rigours of the Penal Laws, a series of enactments which were designed, in the words of the Anglo-Irish historian Lecky, \"to deprive Catholics of all civil life; to reduce them to a condition of extreme, brutal ignorance; and, to disassociate them from the soil\". As a result, whilst to some extent tolerated, the public practice of Catholicism was almost completely extinguished and all Churches existent at the time of the enactment of the laws were ceded to the Established Church. Thus, by the end of the eighteenth century, there were few Catholic churches and no cathedrals in existence in Ireland for a large Catholic population. Following Catholic emancipation in 1829, the need to construct churches and cathedrals to serve this population became apparent. The lack of a Catholic presence in the Primatial City of Armagh in particular became a popular cause of discontent among the emerging Catholic episcopacy, clergy and congregation.\n\nArchbishop William Crolly was appointed to the Catholic See of Armagh in 1835 and almost immediately sought permission to reside in Armagh; the first Catholic Primate to do so since the Reformation. Having settled in the town, he then set about seeking a site for a new Catholic cathedral. The main difficulty in constructing a Catholic cathedral at Armagh was that the land of Armagh City and suburbs consisted almost entirely of \"see-land\", the mensal estate or demesne of the Protestant Primate and thus would not be available for the Catholic episcopacy to purchase. A site at the apex of Sandy Hill on the outskirts of the town had however been sold to the Earl of Dartrey. \nA building committee was established and a weekly penny collection taken in for the construction project. The architect was to be Thomas Duff of Newry who had designed the Cathedral there and also the Pro-Cathedral at Dundalk. He designed a cruciform building, with nave, aisles, transepts, chancel, and choir; a large square central tower, and two smaller ones on the west front flanking the great doorway, and flush with the aisle walls, resembling York Minster. As at Dundalk, the style was a highly romanticised version of the Perpendicular Gothic of the sixteenth century. The foundation stone was laid on St Patrick's Day 1838 but as a result of the Irish Famine, work ground to a halt in 1847 with the foundations and aisles only partially complete.\n\nArchbishop Crolly was himself a victim of the famine, contracting cholera whilst tending to famine ravaged Drogheda and dying on Good Friday 1849, and was buried in the unfinished cathedral. His successor, Archbishop Paul Cullen abandoned the project and moved the Primatial See to Drogheda. It was only when Cullen was translated to Dublin and Archbishop Joseph Dixon was appointed to the See of Armagh that work recommenced in 1854. By this time, Duff was dead and there had been a revolution in ecclesiastical architectural taste in Ireland. Following visits to Ireland by A. W. N. Pugin, the Perpendicular Gothic style of the sixteenth century had fallen from favour and earlier Medieval Gothic had become more popular. The architect James Joseph McCarthy, a self-styled \"pupil\" of Pugin, was appointed to oversee the completion of the Cathedral.\n\nThe position as architect to the new cathedral was rather a difficult one for, by the time of McCarthy's appointment, the walls of Duff's Perpendicular building were already high and had reached the top of the aisles. McCarthy did not wish to continue to build in the now unfashionable Perpendicular Gothic of Duff. His solution was to start building a Decorated Gothic Cathedral of the fourteenth century on top of the purportedly sixteenth century foundations and walls. Decorated Gothic tracery was inserted into the existing window openings and at the West end, he reduced the size of the traceried window and inserted below it an arcade of apostolic statues. The pitch of Duff's roof was raised a full , adding greatly to the exterior impact of the building, and the aisle roofs were raised accordingly, permitting the insertion of a triforium below the clerestory. A sense of drama was added to the transepts by the addition of asymerical spired turrets to their ends and the addition of rose windows to their gables. The most dramatic change effected to Duff's plans was the abandonment of the three rather squat towers designed by Duff to reach a height of . Instead, two breached towers crowned with spires high were constructed at the West end.\n\nDixon died in 1866 again before the completion of the Cathedral and once again the project was abandoned under his elderly successor Archbishop Michael Kieran. It thus fell to Kieran's successor, Archbishop Daniel McGettigan to complete the building. Following the completion of the spires, McGettigan turned his attention to the interior. Here, to capitalise on the increased height gained at the expense of external massing, McCarthy constructed an elaborately carved vaulted hammer-beam roof with carved angels terminating the hammer beams and stone saints as corbels. He designed a Caen stone reredos which spans the entire wall of the east end and which is filled with carvings from the life of the Virgin below an arcade of carved and crocketted pinnacles and centered with a carved canopy over a statue of the Madonna and Child. Archbishop McGettigan commissioned painted murals to adorn the walls of the Lady Chapel and stencilling was applied to its ceiling. The cathedral was dedicated on 24 August 1873.\n\nFollowing the dedication, Primate McGettigan continued to make improvements as funds and his declining health would allow. In 1875, he commissioned the Stations of the Cross from Herbert & Co. of Liverpool and installed the Great 33-stop pipe organ by William Telford. In 1879, the seven-light east window was filled with stained glass by Earley & Powell of Dublin and work began on the seven terrace flight of steps to the plaza in front of the west end. Finally in 1884, a sacristan's lodge was constructed at the bottom of the steps. When Archbishop McGettigan died in December 1887 after some years of failing health, the cathedral had seen the passing of five successive Archbishops and the expenditure of the unprecedented sum of over £70,000.\n\nMcGettigan's successor as Archbishop was Michael Logue, longest serving Archbishop of Armagh. A famously learned cleric, Logue was appointed to the College of Cardinals by Pope Leo XIII in 1893, becoming the first Archbishop of Armagh appointed to the College in its history. When he arrived at the completed cathedral at Armagh, Logue was far from impressed. He complained of the \"weak and beggerly elements\" of interior decoration and stated that \"visitors who had approached the Cathedral filled with admiration for the beauty of its exterior, were…disagreeably surprised, not to say disedified, at the comparative shabbiness and poverty of the interior\". On 20 August 1899, Cardinal Logue issued a Pastoral Letter entitled \"The National Cathedral\" exhorting the people of Ireland and its diaspora to supply sufficient funds to beautify the interior of the Cathedral. A fundraising bazaar was organised in 1900 and the firm of the architect William Hague of Dublin (who had inherited much of McCarthy's practice on the latter's death) was appointed to make plans.\n\nThe bazaar raised over £30,000 and Logue travelled to Italy with his architect to visit marble quarries and artisan workshops, choosing materials and craftspeople to carry out Hague's plans. Hague died soon after designing the first of his additions: a marble rood screen, wide and tall. His replacement was George Coppinger Ashlin, former partner of Pugin's son. Upon appointment, Ashlin almost immediately identified a major structural problem with the roofs on McCarthy's aisles and a new groined roof of Bath Stone was constructed. This, combined with repairs on the foundations of the towers which had not been designed to take the weight of McCarthy's spires, used much of the funds raised by the Bazaar.\n\nNevertheless, Cardinal Logue pressed ahead with lavish plans. Ashlin designed a High Altar carved from Carrara marble, Lapis Lazuli and Jasper to sit before Hague's rood screen and the Italian sculptor, Cesare Aureli was commissioned to carve a frontal in \"alto relievo\" of Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper. Ashlin closed the Crossing by constructing two side screens of statuary marble, wide, across the north and south transepts and statuary marble communion railings inlaid with \"Breccia di S Votaleat\" the Nave. The \"Cathedra\" throne projected in three divisions at the second bay on the North side with canopied niches, having crockets and pinnacles and surmounted by a marble spire. The centre of the throne was carved with the arms of the cardinal in statuary marble. The entire crossing was paved with inlaid marbles, designed in squares with quatrefoil panels and crosses and centred on a \"pietra dura\" representation of the Cardinal's armorial bearings. An elaborate pulpit was constructed at the south west pier of the crossing. Composed of statuary marble inlaid with rare coloured marbles, its plan was octagonal, with angle niches containing statues of the Evangelists, St. Patrick and St. Brigid, the canopies above the statues being groined and carved. The panels between the statues were filled with inlaid traceries. The canopy of the pulpit, rising to a height of nearly 36 ft. was carved in Austrian oak painted white and inlaid with coloured enamels and gold leaf. \n\nBehind the rood screen, McCarthy's reredos was retained intact but its lower portions were enriched with marble inlays in a diaper pattern with \"fleur de lis\" in a vibrant variety of coloured Italian marbles. A new Lady Altar and tabernacle was constructed before the reredos from statuary marble. The antependium contained three bas-relief groups, the work of the eminent Roman sculptor Michele Trepisciano (1860–1913) showing \"The Presentation of the Blessed Virgin in the Temple\", \"The Assumption\" and \"The Coronation of the Virgin\" recessed in separate panels with cusped heads, and columns of \"Breccia di Seravezza antica\" and \"Breccia Corallina\" marbles. The tabernacle, inlaid with Corsican Jasper, was in the form of a cube topped with a roof of fish scale carvings and finished with two large statuary marble standing angels. To the North and South of the Lady Chapel, Side Chapels were erected to St Joseph (North) and St Brigid (South), closing the aisles at the East. In the South transept, a sumptuous altar was erected to the Sacred Heart. Finally, to the West end, McCarthy's wooden gallery was replaced with a three-bay marble screen of white marble supported on quatrefoil pillars of \"Portasanta\" marble and inlaid with \"Brocatello\" marble. The organ itself was rebuilt to suit the newly enlarged space and a new Austrian oak organ case was designed and built.\n\nThe most striking and lasting of Cardinal Logue's legacies to the cathedral were, however, the scheme of mosaics he commissioned to adorn every inch of blank wall in the cathedral. Significant thought was given to how best to deal with the decoration of the walls of the building. Archbishop McGettigan had completed a scheme of painted murals and stencilling of the walls but, as a result of Armagh's damp climate, these had perished within a few years of completion. It was therefore decided to adopt a mosaic decorative scheme, the initial great cost being defrayed by the future saving on repainting a mural scheme. The material employed was Italian pottery of various colours in dice-shaped cubes with glass cubes for the gilt portions to prevent tarnishing and to give greater lustre. The sections were put together in two workshops in London and were carefully glued, face downwards, on strips of paper. These were then applied to a fresh coating of special cement on the walls in a manner resembling the hanging of wallpaper.\n\nTo complete his scheme of decoration, Cardinal Logue commissioned the Italian painter, Oreste Amici (1872–1930), who had been trained at the Institute of Fine Arts in Rome, to paint the entirety of McCarthy's hammer beam roof in an Italianate style. The ceilings are painted in oils, the prevailing shade adopted for the ground colour throughout being of a soft terra-cotta to harmonise with the colour of the wall mosaic.\n\nWith the works complete, the cathedral was solemnly rededicated on 20 July 1904.\n\nWilliam, Cardinal Conway was appointed to the See of Armagh in 1963 although he had been serving as leading Irish participant in the Second Vatican Council since its inauguration. He returned to Armagh as Archbishop keen to institute the reforms suggested by the Council. The reforms on liturgy required greater congregational participation in Catholic services and for some time it had been felt that the 1904 marble works at the crossing had impeded large-scale ritual in the Cathedral. Conway thus inaugurated an architectural competition to adapt the sanctuary of Armagh Cathedral to the new requirements and to allow greater freedom of movement and visibility around the sanctuary area. Several candidates submitted designs and controversially all of them suggested the removal of substantially all Ashlin's marble works at the crossing. Conway chose the winning design by Liam McCormick (1916–1996), though work did not commence on the reorganisation of the crossing until after Cardinal Conway's death in 1977.\n\nIt thus fell to Tomas, Cardinal O'Fiaich to complete the works. As completed, they were as radical as they were divisive. The entirety of the marble work at the crossing was removed and much of it destroyed, including Hague's rood screen and Ashlin's high altar, cathedra, altar rails and inlaid marble floor. The pulpit was dismantled and broken up and the side altars to Saints Brigid and St Joseph were removed and relocated in other churches. Only McCarthy's Caen Stone reredos survived removal, though its lower portions, enriched in 1904 with Carrara marble, were dismantled and floral tapestries attached to the lower portion of the reredos in their stead. New fittings carved from roughly hewn Wicklow Granite were fitted at the crossing and the sanctuary area was extended beyond the line of the former rood screen and raised by several feet and clad in polished Wicklow granite. Criticism had been made of the 1904 scheme's foreign design and materials as a result of which the reorganisation stressed its native roots. The new altar, ambo and tabernacle were carved by a Dundalk sculptor, Peter McTigue and the tabernacle door was manufactured in Kilkenny. Carpets replacing the former marble floor were woven in Killybegs. To replace the rood cross, a huge sculpture entitled \"The Tree of Life\" was commissioned from Imogen Stuart, the German-born Irish sculptor. The Cathedral was again rededicated on 13 June 1982 when relics of St. Malachy were placed in the new altar. \n\nThe works were met with almost unopposed shock and outcry. \"Neither the quality of the replacements nor the skill of the craftsmanship can disguise the total alienation of the new work from the spirit and meaning that was McCarthy's ecclesiological and architectural inspiration. In this setting, these modern intrusions appear dispassionate and irrelevant\" lamented the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society (UAHS, 1992). Architectural historian Jeanne Sheehy wrote of the re-ordering as \"the replacement ... of a fine late Gothic revival chancel with chunks of granite and a tabernacle that looks like a microwave\".\n\nAlthough the decorative style of the cathedral was thus significantly changed in 1982, the building itself had not undergone any major structural works since the replacement of the aisle roofs in 1904. By 2002, the necessity for major structural repairs to the building had become obvious. As a result of the construction methods of the walls and wear to the roof, damp had damaged much of the mosaic and the painted decorations had been dulled with smoke and dust. A great deal of the external stonework had perished and the twin spired towers had become unstable. A Diocesan committee charged with overseeing these major structural works to secure the building decided that the time was also ripe for reviewing the much criticised sanctuary. The firm of Rooney & McConville was commissioned to redesign the sanctuary area. McCormick's vilified fittings were removed in their entirety and the sanctuary area was re-floored with Italian porcelain tiles from Armatile mimicking the inlaid marble floor of 1904 which had survived, largely intact, under McCormick's granite podium. A new altar and ambo of Tunisian limestone were installed. The altar was inspired by early-Irish crosses and has imagery of Christ (Crucified, Risen, Return in Glory), flanked by Apostles, on three sides. The fourth side visible from the main body of the Church shows Our Lord with four Irish saints: St. Patrick, St. Malachy, St. Brigid and St. Oliver Plunkett. Two pairs of brass gates which had survived from the 1899 marble Rood Screen were replicated several times over, welded together, topped with an entirely unconvincing poor quality Gothic cresting and made into a new fully brass screen behind the high altar, restoring a separate Lady Chapel area as the culmination of an ambulatory around the sanctuary area. The tabernacle was removed to the South transept which was itself screened off with further brass screens and the Cathedra placed on a dais directly behind the new altar. An Evangelarium was created in the South tower (now converted to a shop) and the baptistry was restored at the base of the North tower. The base of McCarthy's reredos was restored and the 1904 inlaid marbles uncovered. By the time of the rededication of the cathedral on 25 May 2003, more than £6,000,000 had been spent. \n\nThe Cathedral parish includes the churches of: St. Patrick' Cathedral, the Church Of St Malachy, the Church of St Colmcille at Knockaconey, and the Church of The Immaculate Conception in the Tullysaran District of Armagh.\n\nDaily Mass is held Monday to Saturday at 10:00am. On Sunday, Mass is celebrated at 11:00am & 5:30pm, with a 7:00 pm Vigil Mass on Saturday evening. Holy Day Masses are celebrated at 11:00am. Confessions are usually heard before the Saturday evening vigil mass.\n\n\nThe organ of Armagh Cathedral was originally built by the renowned organ builder William Telford in 1875. In 1987, the organ was rebuilt, enlarged and tonally altered by the Irish Organ Company Ltd. who also provided a new terraced drawknob console. The rebuild was designed by the late John Holmes with the Cathedral Organist Baron George Minne as a consultant. All of the old pipework and casework was not restored and retained. The organ now has elements of the English, French Cavaille-Coll and European style, the dominant sound being French. The organ currently has four manuals and 58 stops.\n\nPositif:\nGelind Gedeckt 8,\nBell Gamba 8,\nSingend Principal 4,\nKoppelflute 4,\nNasard 2 2/3,\nOctavin 2,\nTierce 1 3/5,\nPetit Cymbale III,\nCromorne 8,\nZymbalstern,\nTremulant (adjustable),\nOctave,\nGreat to Positif,\nSwell to Positif,\nBombarde to Positif,\n\nGreat: \nDouble Diapason 16,\nOpen Diapason 8,\nGamba 8,\nBourdon 8,\nPrincipal 4,\nFlute Ouverte 4,\nTwelfth 2 2/3,\nFifteenth 2,\nFourniture V,\nCymbale II (an overall crazy screaming affair,)\nBombarde 16,\nTrompette 8,\nClairon 4,\nSwell to Great,\nPositif to Great,\nPositif Sub-Octave to Great,\n\nSwell:\nOpen Diapason 8,\nStopped Diapason 8,\nSalicional 8,\nUnda Maris 8,\nPrincipal 4,\nDoublette 2,\nPlein Jeu III,\nBasson 16,\nCornopean 8,\nClarion 4,\nTremulant (adjustable),\nOctave,\nSub-Octave,\n\nBombarde:\nFlute Harmonique 8,\nVoce Umana 8+8,\nCarillon III,\nOrlos 8,\nTrompeta Magna 16 (TC from Trompeta Réal 8),\nTrompeta Réal 8,\nClarin 4 (From Trompeta Réal 8),\nCampanabella (one octave of bells),\n\nPedal\nGravissima 32,\nPrincipal 16,\nViolonbasse 16,\nBourdon 16,\nDouble Diapason (Great)\nViolone 8 (From Violonbasse 16),\nGedecktbass 8,\nPrincipal 4,\nDoublette 2,\nGrosse Fourniture III,\nCarillon II,\nBombarde 16,\nBasson 16 (Swell)\nTrumpet 8 (from Bombarde 16),\nClarion 4 (From Bombarde 16),\nOrlos 4 (From Orlos 8, Bombarde)\nPositif to Pedal,\nGreat to Pedal,\nSwell to Pedal,\nBombarde to Pedal,\nGreat and Pedal Pistons Coupled.\n\nThe Organist of St. Patricks Cathedral for over 50 years is Baron George Minne, born in Belgium in 1924.

He is best known for his appearances in the United States with World Championship Wrestling from 1995 to 2000 and with World Wrestling Entertainment from 2006 to 2007.\n\nA third-generation wrestler, Taylor was trained by his father Eric Taylor (who held the British Heavy-Middleweight title for the 14 years 1953–67) and grandfather Joe. After winning several awards as an amateur wrestler, Taylor made his professional debut in 1978 under the ring name Dave \"Rocky\" Taylor.\n\nTaylor eventually joined All Star Wrestling, making his terrestrial TV debut in 1987 when the company gained a share of ITV's wrestling coverage. In early 1988, he was tangentially involved in the falling out of Kendo Nagasaki and Rollerball Rocco when he and 'Ironfist' Clive Myers faced the duo in a televised contest in Croydon. Taylor was attempting, mid-match, to unmask Nagasaki and had nearly succeeded when Rocco intervened. Rocco attempted to pull the mask back down, but Taylor forearm-smashed Rocco, causing the mask to come off in his hands. As Taylor and Myers celebrated, Kendo fled to the dressing room and returned with another mask. Kendo's manager George Gillette blamed Rocco for the unmasking, igniting a major feud that would run on into the early 1990s.\n\nTaylor defeated Dave Finlay for the All-Star British Heavyweight Championship in King's Lynn on 4 June 1991. He held the title for two years before losing to Tony St. Clair on 4 May 1993 in Croydon. After St. Claire vacated the title in 1995, Taylor entered a tournament for the belt, and defeated Marty Jones in the tournament final in August 1995 in Croydon. His second reign lasted until 1996, when he was defeated by Jones in Croydon.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Taylor began wrestling for the German Catch Wrestling Association. On 21 December 1991 in Bremen, he and Chris Benoit defeated Franz Schumann and Miles Zrno for the CWA World Tag Team Championship. They vacated the titles in June 1992 after Taylor suffered an injury and Benoit left the CWA to compete in New Japan Pro Wrestling. Taylor won the CWA Tag Team Championship on a second occasion on 18 July 1993, teaming with Mile Zrno to defeat Larry Cameron and Mad Bull Buster. Cameron and Buster regained the titles on 24 October 1993 in Hanover.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Taylor traveled to the United States of America and joined the Atlanta-based World Championship Wrestling promotion. Taylor, renamed \"Squire David Taylor\", formed a stable with Lord Steven Regal and Earl Robert Eaton known as The Blue Bloods. After Eaton (an American) left the group, Taylor and Regal feuded with him. Taylor continued to team with Regal until Regal was fired from WCW in 2000, at which point Taylor also left the promotion.\n\nIn 2001, Taylor joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), acting as a trainer and wrestler in Ohio Valley Wrestling, a subsidiary of the WWF. Taylor eventually left the WWF after they asked him to relocate to Cincinnati, Ohio, where the Heartland Wrestling Association was located.\n\nIn May 2002, Taylor, William (formerly Steven) Regal and Dave Finlay opened the Atlantan \"Blue Bloods Wrestling Academy\", a professional wrestling school.\n\nOn 7 April 2004 Taylor made an appearance in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling as a mentor/coach of Team Britain during the TNA 2004 America's X-Cup Tournament.\n\nIn February 2005, Taylor came back to the UK for a three weeks with Brian Dixon's All Star Wrestling where he responded to some comments made by Drew McDonald.\n\nTaylor was hired by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in January 2006 to train wrestling students at Deep South Wrestling (DSW) in McDonough, Georgia. On 23 March 2006, Taylor returned to the ring in DSW to once again team with William Regal.\n\nOn 20 October 2006 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Regal announced that Taylor would be joining him on the brand. The two debuted the same night, earning a dominating victory over Scotty 2 Hotty and Funaki. Though the pair reformed their previous tag team, Regal and Taylor would not reuse the \"Blue Bloods\" gimmick, instead portraying themselves as sadistic fighters. The team was quickly put into jeopardy in their second match together when Taylor suffered a torn meniscus in his left knee. Taylor took a more relaxed role for a couple of weeks as a corner man for Regal and only wrestled a few short house show matches. Taylor would quickly heal from his injury and the pair went on to feud with Paul London and Brian Kendrick in the hunt for the WWE Tag Team Championship. After defeating London and Kendrick on several occasions, they earned a Tag Team Championship match at Armageddon in December. The match was changed into a fatal-four way ladder match also involving MNM and The Hardys, and London and Kendrick retained their titles. In a subsequent regular tag rematch on \"SmackDown!\" Regal and Taylor came up short of winning the titles.\n\nAfter WrestleMania 23, Regal and Taylor began a feud with Kane when after a match between Kane and Taylor, Taylor and Regal attacked Kane. The Boogeyman soon joined the feud as Kane's tag team partner, but the feud ended after Kane defeated Regal in a singles match. On 25 May edition of \"SmackDown!\", Regal and Taylor competed in a number one contenders match for the WWE Tag Team Championship against Kendrick and London which they lost when Deuce 'n Domino interfered, making both teams the number one contenders. This led to a triple threat match the next week on \"SmackDown!\", where Deuce 'n Domino retained. Taylor and Regal's tag team would come to an end on 17 June when Regal was drafted to \"Raw\" during the Supplemental Draft.\n\nFollowing Regal's departure, Taylor was absent from \"SmackDown!\" for several weeks and began teaming with Paul Burchill at house shows and dark matches. Since then, Taylor had only competed on \"SmackDown!\" sparingly, competing in a 20-Man Battle Royal for the then-vacant World Heavyweight Championship and losing a match to former rival Kane. Taylor brought Drew McIntyre to \"SmackDown!\" in October 2007 and acted as his mentor, but McIntyre would only make a few appearances before moving to the \"Raw\" brand in January 2008. Following McIntyre's move, Taylor went on a leave of absence from WWE television. He was released by WWE on 28 April 2008.\n\nOn 26 and 27 September Taylor took part in the 2008 Ted Petty Invitational held by IWA Mid-South in Joliet, Illinois.

He was the grandson of Emperor Aurangzeb, during whose reign, he was the \"subahdar\" (viceroy) of Bengal Subah, Bihar and Odisha from 1697 to his death in 1712, and the great grandson of Emperor Shah Jahan.\n\nIn 1697 he was appointed the viceroy of Bengal Subah, Bihar and Odisha by Emperor Aurangzeb. Shortly after, he took successful military initiative against Rahim Khan. Azim gave the East India Company permission to build Fort William in Calcutta (presently Kolkata) in 1696. Using Mughal permission, the Dutch also built Fort Gustavas in Chinsura and the French built Fort Orleans in Chandernagore (presently Chandannagar).\n\nAzim got into conflict with Murshid Quli Khan, the newly appointed Divan of Bengal, over imperial financial control. Considering the complaint of Murshid Quli Khan, Aurangzeb ordered Azim to move to Bihar. In 1703 he transferred the capital to Rajmahal and then again to Pataliputra (present-day Patna). He renamed Pataliputra to \"Azimabad\" after his own name.\n\nIn 1712, at the time of his father's death, he immediately proclaimed himself emperor. However, he was killed (drowned in the Ravi River) shortly afterwards in the succession struggles that ensued.\n\nAzim-us-shan's first wife was Bai Jas Kaur, the daughter of Kirat Singh, who was the son of Raja Jai Singh I, Kachwaha ruler of Amber. She married Azim-ud-din in 1678, and was the mother of Muhammad Karim Mirza born on 12 October 1679. She died at Delhi on 19 February 1721, and was buried at the Qutb.\n\nHis second wife was Sahiba Niswan, a Kasmiri lady, and the sister of Khwajah Inayatullah entitled Shaista Khan. She was the mother of Emperor Farrukhsiyar. Upon Farrukhsiyar's accession on 11 January 1713, she occupied an eminent position in the imperial harem. She died at Delhi in February 1729, having outlived her son for nearly ten years.\n\nHis third wife was Aisha Begum, the daughter of Ruhullah Khan Yazdi, the Mir Bakhshi. She was the granddaughter of Khalilullah Khan. The marriage took place on 26 June 1692. She was the mother of Prince Humayun Bakht Mirza, and Prince Ruh-ud-daula Mirza. Azim-ush-shan is said to have been very fond of her. On 24 May 1709, she gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl. She died at Daulatabad on 15 July 1709, and was buried there, near the tomb of Burhan ud-din.\n\nHis fourth wife was Gitti Ara Begum, the daughter of Prince Muhammad Azam Shah.

{"id": "1935068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935068", "title": "Enamel organ", "text": "Enamel organ\n\nThe enamel organ, also known as the dental organ, is a cellular aggregation seen in a developing tooth and it lies above the dental papilla. The enamel organ is responsible for the formation of enamel, initiation of dentine formation, establishment of the shape of a tooth's crown, and establishment of the dentoenamel junction.\n\nThe enamel organ has four layers; the inner enamel epithelium, outer enamel epithelium, stratum intermedium, and the stellate reticulum.\n\nThe dental papilla, the differentiated ectomesenchyme deep to the enamel organ, will produce dentin and the dental pulp. The surrounding ectomesenchyme tissue, the dental follicle, is the primitive cementum, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone beneath the tooth root. The site where the internal enamel epithelium and external enamel epithelium coalesce is the cervical root, important in proliferation of the dental root.\n\nTooth development begins at week 6 in utero, in the oral epithelium. The process is divided into three stages:\n\n\nAt the end of week 7 i.u., localised proliferations of cells in the dental laminae form round and oval swellings known as tooth buds, which will eventually develop into mesenchymal cells and surround the enamel organ. Each epithelial swelling and the surrounding mesenchymal cells form a tooth germ.\n\nTooth germs are the primitive structure of teeth; their formation is in three distinct stages: bud stage, cap stage, bell stage.\n\nThe stages are based on the degree of development of enamel organ. Oral epithelium forms the tooth enamel while the ectomesenchyme forms the pulp and dentine of the tooth. The ectomesenchyme lies deep to the oral epithelium.\n\nThis is the initial stage of tooth development, which occurs at week 8 i.u.. Proliferation of dental lamina occurs, forming small tooth buds which are spherical or ovoid condensations of epithelial cells, now known as the enamel organ. The enamel organ consists of peripherally located, low columnar cells and centrally located polygonal cells. The enamel organ is also surrounded by proliferating mesenchymal cells, which results in the condensation of two distinct areas:\n\n\nBoth the dental papilla and the tooth sac are not structurally defined in the bud stage, and will become more defined in subsequent stages (Cap and Bell stages). The interaction and signalling between the enamel organ and the surrounding mesenchymal cells play an important role in the later stages of tooth development. Each dental arch will have 10 tooth buds, accounting for 20 primary teeth.\nThe cap stage occurs in week 9-10 i.u. Unequal proliferation of cells during this stage, invaginating into the ectomesenchyme tissue, leads to the formation of the cap-shaped enamel organ. The ectomesenchyme tissue also invaginates superficially to shape the primitive dental pulp. Differentiation of cells occurs at this stage to make different tissue layers; external enamel epithelium, stratum intermedium, stellate reticulum, internal enamel epithelium, dental papilla, and dental follicle. The external enamel epithelium, a layer of simple cuboidal epithelium, has a protective role during tooth development. The stellate reticulum, the innermost layer of the enamel organ, gathers GAGs between cells. The internal enamel epithelium will form enamel during the Bell Stage\n\nThere is uneven growth of enamel organ in this phase, and the epithelial cap deepens. The cap shape of the enamel organ assumes a bell shape as the undersurface of the cap deepens. Foldings of the internal enamel epithelium (done by the growing papilla cells) maps out the occlusal pattern of the tooth crown. The process is known as morphodifferentiation. The pressure exerted by the dental papilla cells has been shown to be opposed equally by the pressure from the fluid in the stellate reticulum (present in the enamel organ).\n\nThe folding of the enamel organ is caused by different rates of mitosis and difference in cell differentiation times, causing different crown shapes in each tooth.\nThis stage is the apposition stage (formation of dental hard tissues), also characterised by the commencement of root formation and mineralisation. The area between the internal enamel epithelium and odontoblasts outline the future dentinoenamel junction. Formation of dentine (dentinogenesis) precedes enamel formation (amelogenesis). It occurs first as along the future dentinoenamel junction in the region of future cusps and proceeds pulpally and apically. Cells of the internal enamel epithelium become pre-ameloblasts and release inductive factors which encourage the differentiation of odontoblasts from the mesenchymal cells of the dental papilla. This can be seen in the figure (marked A). The odontoblasts lay down dentine (see pale blue band). After the first layer of dentine is formed, this induces ameloblasts (B) to lay down enamel (red region) over the dentine in the future incisal and cuspal areas. Amelogenesis will then follow. The cervical portion of the enamel organ then gives rise to the Hertwig Epithelial Root Sheath (HERS)-  this outlines the future root and also is responsible for the size, shape, length and the number of roots.\n\nThe composition of the enamel organ does not vary greatly between incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Although the quantity of odontoblasts, ameloblasts and cementoblasts present in premolars/molars and incisors/canines remains the same, the major difference between these morphological types of teeth is the rate of secretion and quantity of products secreted by the enamel organ (dentine, enamel, cementum). There has been no definite consensus as to what determines the differences between enamel organs in different teeth. However, it is a widely held view by dental professionals and biologists that genes and cell signaling between cells in the dental extracellular matrix/enamel matrix play a role.\n\nThe shape of the enamel layer covering the crown is determined by five growth parameters:\n\n\nThe appositional growth mechanism establishes the thickness of the enamel layer and it is determined by ribbon-like carbonate apatite crystals which are present in the rods (or prisms) and interrods. They are produced by the ameloblast in the bell stage of tooth development. As the crystals are long and closely packed, the thickness depends on the abundance of the crystals in the tooth. Crown shape or morphology is determined by the epithelial-mesenchymal interaction, which occurs at the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ).\nFirstly, the pre-ameloblasts differentiate from the inner enamel epithelia on the dentine surface covering the pulp horn. A wave of ameloblasts will then differentiate from the cusp tip and move through the inner enamel epithelia down the slope of the mineralised dentine surface. The differentiation will extend down the slope of the dentine surface and reaches its limit, where the inner epithelium is fused with the outer enamel epithelium to form Hertwig's epithelial root sheath. Enamel mineral will increase daily (apposition growth) during the secretory stage of amelogenesis (enamel formation). Ultimately, the secretory stage will end and they will transition into maturation stage ameloblasts. These ameloblasts will move down to the enamel surface of the tooth and the shape of the crown and tooth is then established.\n\nOdontomes are considered to be developmental anomalies resulting from the growth of completely differentiated epithelial and mesenchymal cells that give rise to ameloblasts and odontoblasts. Histologically, they are composed of different dental tissues including enamel, dentine, cementum and in some cases, pulp tissue, therefore if the enamel organ is not arranged in its proper fashion, an odontome may form. Odontomes are categorised as either:\n\n\nOdontomes are rare entities and usually asymptomatic; they are often incidental findings on routine dental radiographic examinations. The complex odontome appears as an irregular mass of calcified material surrounded by a thin radiolucent area with smooth periphery, and the compound type shows calcified structures resembling teeth in the centre of a well-defined radiolucent lesion.\n\nSome factors related to the development of odontomes are:\n\n\nThe first reported case of an odontome erupting in the oral cavity was in 1980.\n\nDens Invaginatus is a dental anomaly which means that the affected tooth (dilated odontome) contains a cavity that is completely or partially lined by enamel, radiographically resembling a tooth within a tooth (dens in dente).\n\nThere is a lack of consensus on the aetiology of dens invaginatus. It is suggested that dens invaginatus arises because during odontogenesis, there is proliferation and ingrowth of the cells of the enamel organ into the dental papilla during development.  \n\nAnother proposed theory is that the distortion of the enamel organ during tooth development and subsequent protrusion of a part of the enamel organ will lead to the formation of an enamel-lined channel ending at the cingulum or occasionally at the incisal tip.\n\nHistologically, there are differences in the structure and composition between the external and internal enamel in dens invaginatus. The internal enamel exhibits atypical and more complex rod shapes and its surface has the typical honeycomb pattern but no perikymata.\n\nThe invagination can be:\n\n\nDens invaginatus has a clinical importance as teeth affected with dens invaginatus are predisposed to developing pulpal disease. The invagination allows entry of irritants into an area which is separated from pulpal tissue by only a thin layer of enamel and dentine and extra preventative measures are advised to prevent dental caries.\n\nCoeliac disease in children is thought to be underdiagnosed because it may initially be asymptomatic. Studies have shown that enamel defect of permanent and deciduous or primary teeth may suggest the presence of undiagnosed coeliac disease in children and adults. Coeliac disease-related enamel defects are most commonly associated with incisors and first molar teeth, and are characterised by symmetrical distribution of enamel defects on the same tooth in all 4 quadrants. This is a distinct characteristic of enamel defects in coeliac disease that cannot be seen in other enamel defects.\n\nEnamel defects in coeliac disease occur due to an interference in tooth formation by amelogenin. Amelogenin is a proline-rich enamel protein that plays a major role in mineralisation and organisation of tooth crystals. Disruption to this process cause alterations in the tooth surface. Patients with coeliac disease produce high levels of circulating IgG and IgA antigliadin antibodies (AGA) in order to get rid of protein gliadin, which is toxic to these patients. However, due to the structural similarities between amelogenin and gliadin, AGA may interfere with amelogenin which lead to improper formation of enamel. Furthermore, because IgG can be transported across the placenta, the amelogenesis process is disturbed from the intrauterine period to adolescence.\n\nGliadins are highly hydrophobic proteins in wheat gluten. The antibodies are produced to interact with this protein. Therefore, a gluten-free diet may lead to normalisation of tooth development as circulating antibodies for enamel defect may decrease.\n\n"}

He has been releasing music since 2001 - as a solo artist, with his backing band the Athletes, as part of the Fence Collective and as a member of the trio Yorkston/Thorne/Khan. He has also written fiction and non-fiction books.\n\nA native of Fife, James Yorkston was an integral early member of the Fence Collective, a collaborative group of musicians including King Creosote, The Aliens, KT Tunstall, The Beta Band and The Pictish Trail. Yorkston is primarily a singer-songwriter, although he also tackles a variety of traditional songs, learned from singers such as Anne Briggs, Dick Gaughan, Nic Jones, Martin Carthy, Lal Waterson, John Strachan and Adrian Crowley. His quoted main influences are Anne Briggs, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Michael Hurley, Can and the Malagasy D'Gary.\n\nYorkston started out as bassist for punk band Miraclehead, which morphed into the band Huckleberry, who recorded a number of independently released records. Yorkston's solo career began when John Peel played a demo of his \"Moving Up Country, Roaring the Gospel\", proclaiming it had the best song title of the year. This led to Bad Jazz Records releasing that track as Yorkston's debut 7\" under the name \"J. Wright Presents\".\n\nBy this time Yorkston had started to play solo gigs in Edinburgh, his debut supporting Bert Jansch in the Café Royal. Seeking more shows, Yorkston sent a copy of the single to John Martyn, asking him for a support slot on his forthcoming Edinburgh date, and Martyn responded by offering Yorkston all 31 dates on his tour. Subsequently he signed to Domino Records, recording music with a number of friends and associates credited as The Athletes. His debut album \"Moving Up Country\", co-produced by Simon Raymonde of the Cocteau Twins, became Rough Trade Record Shops Album of the Year for 2002. In 2003 Yorkston played at the inaugural Green Man Festival.\n\nFor Yorkston's second album, he asked Kieran Hebden of Four Tet on board as producer, and they made \"Just Beyond the River\". Released on vinyl, CD and as a limited edition 2CD set with the otherwise unavailable EP \"Fearsome Fairytale Lovers\", the album was well received by the music press. Pete Paphides of \"The Times\" wrote, \"Yorkston has reached a state of grace that writers can spend forever trying to attain: songs that sound not so much written as carefully retrieved from your own subconscious, played with an intuition bordering on telepathy. What more could you ask for?\" while \"Pitchfork\" said, \"Yorkston's record creates a bucolic, timeless world where magic remains a recent memory.\" Yorkston's fan base continued to grow and he was offered tours with Beth Orton, David Gray, Tindersticks, Turin Brakes, Lambchop and Kathryn Williams, as well as a slot on the Accelerator tour of Sweden.\n\nThe follow-up, \"The Year of the Leopard\" (2006), was produced by Rustin Man, who had recently worked with Beth Gibbons (lead singer with the band Portishead) on their \"Out of Season\" record. The album was again well received by the press. Drowned in Sound said, \"Yorkston’s voice is red-wine warm and perfectly at ease with itself, filling each track to the brim with understated honesty\", while Alexis Petridis, writing in \"The Guardian\", said, \"this is music that slowly charms rather than immediately stuns you, taking time to work its way under your skin. Once there, however, its lovely, understated melodies, autumnal arrangements and warm, wry lyrics...are virtually impossible to shift.\" Later the same year, Yorkston was given the chance to play with Bert Jansch once more, this time in Paris. Yorkston also invited Martin Carthy to play and share a stage with him at London's Union Chapel on 24 May 2007.\n\nAlso in 2007, Domino Records released \"Roaring the Gospel\", a collection of EP tracks, overseas releases and new songs, which led the \"NME\" to observe that \"Yorkston has talent as deep as a mine shaft\", while the BBC website said, \"Yorkston and his Athletes bathe their songs with warmth, allowing them to nestle snugly in a lush bed of tenderly plucked acoustic guitars, sighing woodwind and gently wheezing accordion.\"\n\nIn October 2007, Yorkston was invited to work as Musical Director with Oliver Knight and the Waterson–Carthy clan for the BBC Electric Proms tribute to Lal Waterson. This was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 by the \"Mike Harding Show\" as well as being filmed. Alongside Waterson–Carthy, the acts involved included Alasdair Roberts, Kathryn Williams and Lisa Knapp. Yorkston's involvement with the Fence Collective continued: he has toured extensively with King Creosote and regularly contributed to the Fence Collective's Homegame mini-festivals featuring guest performances by artists such as The Concretes and Hot Chip. Yorkston also plays in the Fence Collective bands The 3 Craws, Pictish Trail and U.N.P.O.C..\n\nYorkston's fifth album, \"When the Haar Rolls In\", was released through Domino Records on 1 September 2008. Guests included Norma Waterson, Mike Waterson, Marry Waterson and Oliver Knight. A special edition was released featuring an album of remixes and an album of James Yorkston covers by artists such as King Creosote, U.N.P.O.C. and Cathal Coughlan. Among the positive reviews, the website PopMatters called the album, \"one of the most consistently compelling and beautiful records to be released in quite a while.\"\n\nIn August 2009, Yorkston collaborated with the band the Big Eyes Family Players on the album \"Folk Songs\". As the title suggests, all of the tracks are traditional British and Irish folk songs (along with one from Galicia, Spain). Many of them are versions of songs recorded by singers in the 1960s British folk revival, such as Nic Jones, Anne Briggs and Shirley Collins. In 2012, the Big Eyes Family Players released a follow-up album entitled \"Folk Songs II\" on Static Caravan Recordings, featuring a variety of guest vocalists including Yorkston, Alasdair Roberts and Adrian Crowley.\n\nIn 2011, he collaborated with The Fruit Tree Foundation, appearing on its debut album, \"First Edition\".\n\nIn August 2012, Domino Records released Yorkston's seventh album, \"I Was a Cat from a Book\", which was co-produced by the Welsh singer David Wrench and features a guest appearance by Kathryn Williams.\nAmong the generally positive reviews, The Line of Best Fit said, \"Yorkston exposes and plays with his emotional connection to life around him, showing once again that he is able to put pen to paper in a way that his contemporaries can only dream of\", while The Arts Desk praised \"Yorkston’s well-crafted songs, swathed in atmospheric strings, and tinged with melancholy and mystery\". The album debuted on the Official Record Store Chart at number 6.\n\nOn 3 November 2012, Doogie Paul, double-bassist of The Athletes, died of cancer aged 40. Yorkston wrote the song \"Broken Wave (A Blues for Doogie)\" in tribute to his friend , and this track would go on to feature on his next album, \"The Cellardyke Recording and Wassailing Society\". Released in August 2014, it was produced by Alexis Taylor of synth-pop band Hot Chip, and featured special guests KT Tunstall and The Pictish Trail, amongst others. Once again, the album received very good reviews, with the NME calling Yorkston, \"one of the country's great songwriters\", commenting: \"His honesty, wry humour and rippling folk guitar are on peak form on his collaboration-focused eighth album.\"\n\nFor Record Store Day 2015, Domino Records released a limited edition vinyl album entitled \"The Demonstrations of the Craws\", featuring a compilation of demos from \"The Cellardyke Recording and Wassailing Society\" and \"I Was a Cat from a Book\". Yorkston also began running his folk club Tae Sup wi' a Fifer, in Kirkcaldy, Fife, featuring guests such as Martin Carthy, Alexis Taylor, Dick Gaughan, Richard Dawson, Bill Wells and Aidan Moffat, Karine Polwart, Lisa O'Neill, Steve Mason, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Brìghde Chaimbeul, Malcolm Middleton, Ian McMillan, Ian Rankin, Horse McDonald and Phill Jupitus.\n\nIn 2016, Yorkston released the album \"Everything Sacred\" as part of a trio, with Jon Thorne (a double bass player best known for his work with electro outfit Lamb) and Suhail Yusuf Khan, an eighth generation Sarangi player from New Delhi, India, under the name Yorkston/Thorne/Khan. The unusual blend of musical influences prompted enthusiastic reviews, with Folk Radio UK observing, \"There is a constant state of flux, a constant drip of influences from one to another that augments creative possibilities rather than diluting them. Yorkston, Thorne and Khan have taken advantage of these possibilities to create an album that bristles with inventiveness and skill, an album that is more than the sum of its already impressive parts.\"\n\nThe trio went on to release two further critically-acclaimed albums, \"Neuk Wight Delhi All-Stars\" (2017) and \"Navarasa: Nine Emotions\" (2020).\n\nHis ninth album, \"The Route to the Harmonium\", recorded in the small Scottish fishing village of Cellardyke and co-produced by David Wrench, was released on 22 February 2019, via Domino to mostly positive reviews. Drowned In Sound commented that, \"His music feels part of the scenery rather than derived from it. The softly picked and swept guitars spread their roots deep into his musical heritage, while the songs he sings tell tales that feel passed through the generations, even in their deeply personal nature.\" Meanwhile, The Skinny called it, \"a captivating listen that demands your attention.\"\n\nIn March 2011 Yorkston's debut book, \"It's Lovely to be Here: The Touring Diaries of a Scottish Gent\", launched Domino Records new publishing venture, the Domino Press. The website Goodreads called the book \"a once-in-a-generation behind-the-scenes account of the music world seen from the eyes of a working singer-songwriter\", while The Line of Best Fit called it \"a charming and witty account of life on the road.\" \n\nIn early 2016, Freight Books published Yorkston's debut novel, \"Three Craws\". The tale of a failed artist returning home to Scotland from London, the book was praised by \"The Scotsman\" as being, \"a subtle, insightful and occasionally very funny look at the way small rural communities can sometimes smother their own, pushing people away while simultaneously pulling them back, demanding success while at the same time secretly hoping for failure.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It provides guidelines for using physical quantities, quantity and unit symbols, and coherent unit systems, especially the SI. It is intended for use in all fields of science and technology and is augmented by more specialized conventions defined in other parts of the ISO 31 standard. ISO 31-0 was withdrawn on 17 November 2009. It is superseded by ISO 80000-1. Other parts of ISO 31 have also been withdrawn and replaced by parts of ISO 80000.\n\nISO 31 covers physical quantities used for the quantitative description of physical phenomena. The presentation here is a summary of some of the detailed guidelines and examples given in the standard.\n\nPhysical quantities can be grouped into mutually comparable categories. For example, length, width, diameter and wavelength are all in the same category, that is they are all \"quantities of the same kind\". One particular example of such a quantity can be chosen as a reference quantity, called the \"unit\", and then all other quantities in the same category can be expressed in terms of this unit, multiplied by a number called the \"numerical value\". For example, if we write\n\nthen \"\"λ\"\" is the symbol for the physical quantity (wavelength), \"m\" is the symbol for the unit (metre), and \"6.982 × 10\" is the numerical value of the wavelength in metres.\n\nMore generally, we can write\n\nwhere \"A\" is the symbol for the quantity, {\"A\"} symbolizes the numerical value of \"A\", and [\"A\"] represents the corresponding unit in which \"A\" is expressed here. Both the numerical value and the unit symbol are factors, and their product is the quantity. A quantity itself has no inherent particular numerical value or unit; as with any product, there are many different combinations of numerical value and unit that lead to the same quantity (e.g., \"A\" = 300 ⋅ m = 0.3 ⋅ km = ...). This ambiguity makes the {\"A\"} and [\"A\"] notations useless, unless they are used together.\n\nThe value of a quantity is independent of the unit chosen to represent it. It must be distinguished from the numerical value of the quantity that occurs when the quantity is expressed in a particular unit. The above curly-bracket notation could be extended with a unit-symbol index to clarify this dependency, as in {\"λ\"} = 6.982 × 10 or equivalently {\"λ\"} = 698.2. In practice, where it is necessary to refer to the numerical value of a quantity expressed in a particular unit, it is notationally more convenient to simply divide the quantity through that unit, as in\n\nor equivalently\n\nThis is a particularly useful and widely used notation for labelling the axes of graphs or for the headings of table columns, where repeating the unit after each numerical value can be typographically inconvenient.\n\n\n\nSee Sect. 3.3 of the Standard text.\n\n\nA comprehensive list of internationally standardized mathematical symbols and notations can be found in ISO 31-11.\n\n\n"}

It was released for the Atari ST, Amiga, Acorn Archimedes and PC.\nThe title track of the game is the instrumental version of the hit single \"\"Doin' the Do\"\", by Betty Boo, originally released in 1990 on the \"Rhythm King\" label.\n\nMagic Pockets also appeared as competition on the Saturday morning children's TV show Motormouth. The caller would watch the game on their TV screen at home and shout the instructions 'walk', 'jump' and 'zap' to control the character.\n\nA young boy, known as the Bitmap Kid, has a pair of magic trousers that contain pockets with an infinite amount of storage space, and therefore he stores all of his toys in his pockets. One day the creatures who live in his pockets decide to keep his toys for themselves and play with them, so the Bitmap Kid must go on a journey to retrieve his toys from the creatures.\n\nThe game is a platform game with standard abilities of walking, jumping, and hurling items to defeat foes. There are four areas in the game; Cave, Jungle, River and Mountain areas, each of which is split into several stages including a bonus stage where the Bitmap Kid must outdo the creatures depending on what toy is to be retrieved - for example, the Bike is found in the Cave area, and so the bonus stage is a bike race against the creatures.\n\nThe Bitmap Kid has a different attack for every area of the game, all of which may be \"charged up\" by holding down the fire button to throw a bigger projectile. The largest projectile has the ability to \"suck up\" enemies rather than destroying them - they will then be converted into pickups. Pickups range from sweets, which add points, to Silver and Gold stars which introduce another aspect of gameplay; Helmets. By collecting silver stars, the Bitmap Kid can then collect a gold star, which will produce a helmet he can wear for a limited time. Helmets vary from teleporters, to laser beams, to invincibility. He may also 'float' by using chewing gum, collected from gum dispensers in the levels, to inflate a large bubble. Bubbles can sometimes help to reach secret areas.\n\nThere is no timer in the game; however, if you take too long a transparent bubble will appear and chase after the Bitmap Kid, gradually growing faster and faster over time. If they come into contact, the bubble will trap the kid and he will lose all his power-ups, except at the last stage, where the bubble will kill him. The game moves at a rather slow pace and levels are often huge, so the bubble is an increasingly common occurrence as the game progresses.\n\nThere were plans for a Game Boy Advance version of Magic Pockets, and was officially announced in 2002, however the remake has been evidently cancelled.\n\nThe PC versions of the game used a rather primitive copy protection system where the game would ask for a password after the first level. The password could be obtained by referencing a password sheet shipped with the game.\n\n\"Magic Pockets\" was developed by The Bitmap Brothers and published by Renegade Software. Described as their first attempt at a \"cutesy platform game\", inspirations game came from \"Super Mario Bros.\", \"Rainbow Islands\", and \"Flood\".

Located in the Masovian Voivodship, about 110 km north of Warsaw and about 115 km south of Olsztyn, it is the capital of Przasnysz County. It has 18,093 inhabitants (2004). It was one of the most important towns in Mazovia during the Middle Ages. Przasnysz was granted town privileges in 1427.\n\nThe oldest traces of settlement in the area of Przasnysz come from the turn of the Bronze and Iron Age (around 700 BC). In the 13th century in Przasnysz, on the Węgierka River, there was a market settlement. There was also a hunting court of the Mazovian princes, described by Henryk Sienkiewicz in Krzyżacy. The name of the city according to folk sources comes from the miller Przaśnik, who hosted the stray hunting Prince Konrad I of Mazovia and was then knighted with the surrounding lands.\n\nPrzasnysz's rapid development was due to its favorable location on the border between two economically important areas - the Kurpiowska Plain and the agricultural Ciechanowska Upland. On October 10, 1427, Przasnysz obtained the town privilege under the Chełmno law from the Masovian prince Janusz I the Elder. The city flourished in the 16th century, especially after the incorporation of Mazovia into the Crown in 1526. Administratively Przasnysz was part of the Ciechanów District as the capital of a vast powiat.\n\nIn 1576, Przasnysz became the seat of the non-castle eldership. In 1648, the Przasnysz eldership was awarded to the defender of Zbaraż, Prince Jeremi Wiśniowiecki.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Kościuszko Uprising and the Third Partition of Poland (1795), Przasnysz became part of the Prussian monarchy as the seat of a large poviat including Ciechanów.\n\nOn January 30, 1807, Napoleon Bonaparte made a visit in Przasnysz.\n\nIn the years 1807–1815 Przasnysz was part of the Duchy of Warsaw, and then, after the Congress of Vienna, became part of the Kingdom of Poland, which was part of the Russian Empire.\n\nDuring World War I, in November and December 1914, heavy fighting took place near Przasnysz between the Russian and German armies. The city changed hands many times. February 24, 1915 was taken by the Germans, but on February 27 they were forced out by Russian troops from the First and Second Siberian Corps.\n\nIn August 1920, extremely fierce battles with the Bolshevik 15 Army took place near Przasnysz. For two weeks the city was occupied by the Soviet army. On August 21, 202 Liberation was brought by Przasnysz Infantry Regiment from the Volunteer Division of Colonel Adam Koc.\n\nIn the interwar period, Przasnysz was the capital of the poviat in the Warsaw Province. In the first years of independence, reconstruction from war damage continued. Many public buildings were built: power plant, junior high school and elementary school, agricultural school, city theater, stadium and sports house. The main occupation of the inhabitants of Przasnysz was still agriculture, craft and small trade. In 1938, Przasnysz had 8,000 residents, including approx. 3 thousand Jews.\n\nIn the first days of September 1939 near Przasnysz, the Mazowiecka Cavalry Brigade fought hard, under the command of Colonel Jan Karcz. After the September defeat, the Germans joined the Przasnysz District to the Reich.\n\nShortly after the Soviet army seized the city on January 18, 1945, the NKVD began mass arrests and deportations of Polish patriots. In the years 1945–1951, numerous armed units of the anti-communist underground operated near Przasnysz.\n\nIn the 1960s, the rapid development of the city began, slowed down as a result of the administrative reform of 1975. In 1966, a branch of Zakład Aparatury Gospodarcza im. Georgi Dimitrov, where lightning arrestors were produced. For the needs of this plant, a school complex was established to house a vocational school and technical college.\n\nSince January 1, 1999, Przasnysz is the seat of the county in the Masovian Voivodeship.\n\n\nThe coat of arms of Przasnysz depicts a defensive wall made of red brick on a silver (white) shield, with three such towers of equal height. Each tower is covered with a conical red roof. Each tower has an entrance gate and one soaring hole above it, both black. Heraldic shield border black. \n\nThe heraldic image dates from the 16th century.\n\nStatut Miasta Przasnysz\n"}

The band acquired three more members in that year, with Bass guitarist Tom Swann from Droitwich plus guitarist Dan Sells, now lead singer of The Feeling (the latter of whom was later replaced by Chris Leonard), and signed with Innocent Records in 2002. Also recruited as a guitarist was Carlos Garcia of The Crave.\n\nThe band supported then labelmates Blue on their UK tour in early 2003, played a number of university gigs, and played to over 25,000 people in September 2003 at the KC Stadium in Hull as part of a charity event made by the local radio station, Viking FM. A recent mashup by The Freelance Hellraiser of the Christina Aguilera hit \"Genie in a Bottle\" and \"Hard to Explain\" by The Strokes had been a popular online and radio hit, but was refused commercial release by the record label. Seizing on this Speedway covered the Aguilera song to sound as close to the mashup as possible, and as a result it became their first single as a double A-side, with another song, \"Save Yourself\" and reached No. 10 in the UK Singles Chart. \n\nTheir second single, \"Can't Turn Back\" reached No. 12 in February 2004. Their third single, \"In & Out\", hit No. 33 in June, and their album, \"Save Yourself\" was released just after \"Can't Turn Back\" came out. It did not fare well in the UK Albums Chart. Speedway thus left Innocent Records after their first UK tour, and later split up, later reforming briefly to support Bryan Adams on his ten date UK tour later that year.\n\nJackson later toured the material for an acoustic solo album in support of Nashville, Tennessee artist, Kevin Montgomery, formed a duo with the Irish singer-songwriter Gianna Cassidy called Jackson and Cassidy, and released her first solo album in 2006. Jackson is currently working with her own band, members include Alan Frew (guitar) Carl Taylor (drums) and Lorna Thomas (bass).\n\nDuguid was until recently drumming and writing for the Scottish singer-songwriter Paolo Nutini (who supported Speedway at some of their later gigs in 2004) and can be seen in the videos to Nutini's singles.\n\n\"Speedway are that rarest of rock things: a British band with a fantastically photogenic lead singer, songs minted in some exclusive, radio-friendly hit factory, the makings of a great live act, and a sound that seems to come emblazoned with dollar signs.\" – Sunday Times\n\n\"Jackson exudes confidence and looks every inch the rock star.\" – Mail on Sunday\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1935120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935120", "title": "Yoshimitsu", "text": "Yoshimitsu\n\nYoshimitsu's first appearance was in 1994's original \"Tekken\". Kunimitsu's story in \"Tekken 2\" reveals that Yoshimitsu's blade is passed down through the Manji Clan's leaders. The clan is dedicated to a mission to help the weak and fight oppression. Upon the inauguration of a new leader, his or her predecessor is ritually sacrificed, and the blade absorbs the person's power and skill. In the game's story, Yoshimitsu enters the first tournament as a decoy so as to allow other Manji to steal the tournament's funds unobserved. During the tournament, Yoshimitsu learns of Ganryu, a sumo wrestler whose disrespectful attitude in the ring cost him his promotion to the rank of yokozuna. His base disrespect for the sumo code infuriates Yoshimitsu, who defeats him. Later, Yoshimitsu leads a raid on Dr. Bosconovitch's lab in order to steal his Eternal Energy device. Though Yoshimitsu loses his arm during the operation, Bosconovitch helps him escape and fits him with a mechanical prosthetic replacement. Grateful for his help, he tells Bosconovitch that he may call on him whenever he needs help. In \"Tekken 2\", Yoshimitsu learns that Bosconovitch has been kidnapped by the Guiane Paklibutushitsu and enters the second Tekken tournament to rescue him. Also, Kunimitsu, Yoshimitsu's former Manji Clan second-in-command, returns to the tournament in order to steal the clan's itachi. Yoshimitsu defeats her and drops out of the tournament to rescue the doctor after learning his location.\n\nIn \"Tekken 3\", Yoshimitsu visits Bosconovitch, who is suffering from a disease that he caught when he built the Cold Sleep machine. Bosconovitch tells him that the disease can only be cured using the blood of Ogre, a god recently awakened from its deep slumber. Yoshimitsu then enters the King of Iron Fist Tournament 3 in order to obtain the blood. During the tournament, he is targeted by Bryan Fury, a cyborg sent to kill him and capture Dr. Bosconovitch by Dr. Abel, Bosconovitch's rival. Yoshimitsu manages to escape Bryan. The outcome of Yoshimitsu's search for Ogre's blood is unknown, though he most likely succeeds.\n\nTwo years later, during the events of \"Tekken 4\", Yoshimitsu realizes that the future of his clan is waning due to a lack of necessary funds and manpower. Upon learning of \"The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4\", he forms an alliance with Mishima Zaibatsu and enters the tournament. While Yoshimitsu is robbing the Mishima Zaibatsu mansion near the end of the tournament, he discovers an unconscious Bryan Fury. He takes him to Bosconovitch's lab so the doctor can transfer Bryan to a new body. Bosconovitch then injects Bryan with drugs to put him to a year-long sleep. However, when Yoshimitsu visits Boskonovitch's lab a month later, he finds it destroyed and many of his compatriots dead. An injured Dr. Bosconovitch tells him that Bryan woke up only a month after the injection and went on a rampage with his new body. Swearing revenge, Yoshimitsu enters The King of Iron Fist Tournament 5 to hunt Bryan.\n\nWhile trying to find Bryan, Yoshimitsu learns that his sword is weakening. As his sword is cursed, it will lose its power and drive its user insane if it does not kill evildoers for a prolonged amount of time. He decides to adopt a second sword called Fumaken, which has the ability to suppress the cursed sword's properties, and enters the King of Iron Fist Tournament 6 in order to restore the power of the cursed sword. Following the tournament's end and Jin Kazama's disappearance, Heihachi Mishima assumes the position of CEO of Mishima Zaibatsu. Yoshimitsu senses something amiss and decides to enter the King of Iron Fist Tournament 7 to confirm his suspicions.\n\nYoshimitsu also appears in other \"Tekken\" games, namely \"Tekken Tag Tournament\", \"Tekken Card Challenge\", \"Tekken Advance\", \"Tekken Resolute\", \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\", \"\" and \"Tekken Card Tournament\".\n\nAn ancestor of Yoshimitsu with the same name first appears in Namco's \"Soulcalibur\" series in 1998's \"Soulcalibur\". After refusing power-hungry lord Oda Nobunaga's offer of alliance, Yoshimitsu discovers his village has been destroyed. In a battle with Nobunaga's army, Yoshimitsu loses his arm. He subsequently sets out to find the fabled weapon Soul Edge in order to have revenge against Nobunaga. In meditation, Yoshimitsu decides that if he were to give in to his hatred, he would be no better than Nobunaga or Nightmare. When he reaches the castle where Soul Edge is, he discovers it has been locked away with Soul Calibur.\n\nIn the \"Soul\" series, Yoshimitsu uses his beloved self-named katana and the Manji ninjutsu combat style, handed down through many generations in the Manji Clan. His weapon seems like a normal katana, but it has many unique features that accommodate the unique fighting style of the Manji. Since it was forged with secret Manji techniques, it cannot be replicated and is the last of its kind. After the massacre of his clan, Yoshimitsu swears an oath of vengeance to the weapon. He also uses the sashimono on his back as a striking weapon. In \"Soulcalibur II\", Yoshimitsu discovers that his katana has been impregnated with corrupted energy from the castle, and so resolves to rid his blade of the evil. The katana was stolen by Voldo when Yoshimitsu was worn out from trying to fight its corruption. Fearing what would happen if the weapon wound up in the wrong hands, Yoshimitsu sets out to retrieve the katana, and in the process discovers a fragment of the Soul Edge. Wanting to destroy the fragments spread across the earth, Yoshimitsu forms a band of chivalrous thieves, known as the Manjitou, in order to do good and to find the remaining fragments.\n\nYoshimitsu returns in \"Soulcalibur III\", in which he plans a robbery in order to steal a fragment of the Soul Edge. The robbery fails as Tira, a servant of Soul Edge and Nightmare, ambushes the thieves and takes the fragment. Later on, Tira murders one of his clan members, causing Yoshimitsu to seek her for revenge in \"Soulcalibur IV\". By the time of \"Soulcalibur V\", the first Yoshimitsu has been ritually executed and succeeded by a younger, eerily similar protégé (hailing from Taki's Fûma village), who shares his fighting style, voice, mannerisms, and even his clockwork arm. This secret line of succession makes \"Yoshimitsu\" appear immortal to outsiders and is implied to continue into modern times with the \"Tekken\" incarnation of the character.\n\nYoshimitsu has appeared in other Namco games. His \"Tekken 3\" incarnation is a bonus character available in \"Anna Kournikova's Smash Court Tennis\" for the PlayStation and his \"Tekken 3\" \"energy sword\" is one of the game's unlockable secret tennis racquets. Yoshimitsu's sword is also an available weapon in the \"Tekken\" spin-off game \"Death by Degrees\". He appears in the Capcom-made crossover game \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", where his official tag partner is Raven. One of his alternate costumes in the game is M. Bison's uniform, and Capcom stated that a \"rumor says\" that after defeating Bison, Yoshimitsu also took his Psycho Power ability as his own.\n\nYoshimitsu has brief cameos in the animated film \"\". He also appears in the 2009 live-action film \"Tekken\", portrayed by Gary Ray Stearns, where he fights and loses against Jin Kazama.\n\nIn 2006, Namco and MegaHouse released a Yoshimitsu figurine as part of a \"Tekken 5\" set based on promotional artwork for the game. While not posable, the PVC figure came with equippable clothing modeled after those in the game. Two more figurines were made by Bandai in 2009, based on his appearance in \"Tekken 6\". A statue of Yoshimitsu based on his appearance in \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\" was produced by Kotobukiya in 2012.\n\nYoshimitsu's name roughly translates to \"Light of Happiness\". His outfits often employ the kanji \"宇\" (Romaji: \"u\", Pinyin: \"yǔ\"), which means \"universe\". In the \"Tekken\" series, Yoshimitsu's sword is usually depicted as a tachi. From \"Tekken 3\" onwards, the sword emanates energy around the blade, giving it the appearance of a lightsaber. In some \"Tekken\" games, such as \"Tekken 4\", he wields a normal katana.\n\nAccording to Namco's official description, Yoshimitsu's fighting style \"incorporates a blend of ninjutsu, sword attacks from kenjutsu, and special stances from kabuki dance. Wielding a sword, he has many attacks that utilize it. He can perform slashes with it, use it to impale his opponent, and rotate it with his mechanical left hand in a windmill manner (he can also use this method to fly)\". He also possesses many moves with strange properties; his \"harakiri\" moves require a large portion of his own health to perform, and he and Lei Wulong are the only characters with the ability to restore health. Michael Harradence of \"PlayStation Universe\" considered Yoshimitsu and Bryan Fury to be a top pairing in \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\", in that \"Bryan is your heavy hitter, with his meaty kicks and punches delivering some health-zapping blows, while Yoshimitsu can confuse and abuse his victims with some intricate juggles and mix-up combos.\"\n\nYoshimitsu's second sword in \"Tekken 6\" gives him a revamped move set, making him an even harder character to learn to play. According to IGN, in \"Soulcalibur IV\" \"new players are often at a loss as to how to handle the character, but once they get a handle on him, Yoshimitsu becomes a true force of nature.\"\n\nYoshimitsu has been positively received by gaming media for his design and characterization. Lucas Sullivan of \"GamesRadar\" rated him third on his 2012 selection of the \"top 7 best fighting game characters\", as his \"most impressive trait is how frequently his costume changes.\" Jack Pooley of \"WhatCulture\", in 2014, ranked him the ninth-greatest fighting game character, and among the genre's \"most stylish\" characters. Jesse Schedeen of IGN considered the character \"just too awesome to be confined to one fighting game series.\" In 2013, Kevin Wong of \"Complex\" ranked him the ninth-best \"Tekken\" character out of twenty, calling him \"easy to love\", but, conversely, a \"cheater\": \"Yoshimitsu's the only character who gets to use a sword, and an unblockable one at that.\" Rich Knight of \"Complex\" considered Yoshimitsu \"out of place\" in the \"Tekken\" series, but \"one of the \"Soul\" series' best characters.\" In 2011, Machinima ranked Yoshimitsu as the seventh-best ninja in video games, while \"PLAY's\" Ian Dransfield listed the character among the top ten ninjas on PlayStation consoles: \"He used to rob from the rich and give to the poor, but now he just dances around, balancing on the hilt of his sword and annoying whoever he’s fighting against\". Lisa Foiles of \"The Escapist\" rated Yoshimitsu fifth in her 2014 list of the \"top five katana wielders\". Ian Garstang of \"Gaming Debugged\" commented in 2014: \"Many a time gamers angrily walked away from a \"Tekken\" arcade machine or tossed a controller down in frustration after losing to this ninja master.\" In 2010, prior to the release of \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", Michael Grimm of \"GamesRadar\" listed Sodom and the cyborg version of Yoshimitsu (\"Both bring some pizzazz to the tired old samurai fashion scene\") as a matchup he wanted to see in the game. Gergo Vas of Kotaku ranked Yoshimitsu eighth in his 2013 list of the \"most insane\" cyborgs in Japanese video games\". Yoshimitsu was ranked by Den of Geek as the \"5th best Tekken character\", with comments \"He’s a complete wildcard to Tekken who sort of fits but sort of doesn’t. He’s such a staple to that whole universe that even having one Tekken without him would feel wrong.\" He was also placed 5th on \"Paste\" list \"The 30 Best Tekken Characters\", with comments:\"The master of makeovers, this enigmatic ninja has seen more costume changes during his tenure than a runway model. His unusual appearance is matched only by his equally strange fighting style.\" Additionally, Yoshimitsu was named by TheGamer as the \"coolest Tekken character\", stating \"One of the most beloved characters in the series and one of the only characters to appear in every installment of Tekken, Yoshimitsu is one of the coolest fighting characters ever created.\"\n\nIn 2011, UGO.com ranked Yoshimitsu's \"Tekken 5\" \"Blue\" costume as the ninth-\"Most Stylin' Alternate Costume\" in gaming. Gavin Jasper of 4thletter.net placed Yoshimitsu's \"Tekken 4\" ending, in which he cons Heihachi and the evil Mishima Zaibatsu corporation out of a large sum of money, 33rd in his 2013 ranking of the top 200 fighting game endings. Angelo Dargenio of Arcade Sushi ranked Yoshimitsu's suicide move as the seventeenth-\"most iconic fighting game move\", but described it as \"never actually … a useful move in combat, because it does cost you a huge chunk of life.\" Prima Games ranked it the fourteenth-\"greatest fighting move in video game history\", commenting: \"Hey, if you're gonna go, you might as well take someone with you, right? \"\n\nYoshimitsu has received cooler reception from fans; he was rated the sixth-most popular \"Soul\" character in a 2002 poll held by Namco prior to the release of \"Soulcalibur II\" with 4.56% of the votes, seven percentage points behind fifth-place Cervantes de Leon. In another poll from Namco in 2012, Yoshimitsu was the 22nd-most requested out of 54 \"Tekken\" characters to be playable in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", with 5503 (6.23%) of 88,280 fan votes.\n\n"}

After World War II, she defected from the Soviet underground. She came to prominence by testifying in the second case of Alger Hiss in 1949; later, she published accounts about the underground.\n\nVienna: Massing was born in 1900 to a Polish father and Austrian mother in Vienna. Her parents' unhappy marriage (caused in large part by her father's constant philandering) alienated her from her family. She had a brother, Walter, seven years younger, and sister, Elli, nine years younger. After finishing high school, she apprenticed unhappily and unsuccessfully in a millinery shop. Attendance of summer public lectures by Karl Kraus rekindled her interest in literature. She applied for and received a scholarship for dramatic literature at the Burgtheater that eventually led to her external career as an actress. Entering the cafe, literary scene (her \"\" was at Cafe Herrenhof), she met Peter Altenberg, Elizabeth Bergner, Franz Werfel, Albert Ehrenstein—and her first husband, Gerhart Eisler. Eisler invited her to join his Communist-committed life by leaving her family and coming to live with him at his parents' home in a party marriage. In 1920, when Eisler received an invitation to work in Berlin, the two got a civil marriage in December 1920.\n\nIn January 1921, Gerhart Eisler became associate editor of the Die Rote Fahne. It was Germany's leading left-wing newspaper. He moved to Berlin and joined the German Communist Party. Hede became more involved in politics and spent hours discussing politics with her husband and sister-in-law, Ruth Fischer. \"I read about the Russian Revolution, about Lenin and Vera Figner, who became my idol; and I learned to love the idea of socialism the idea of a better life for everyone. True, I never faced the reality of everyday work within the movement. I moved only among the upper crust of the Communists... I was imbued with the rather snobbish attitude of Gerhart to people who were not as bright as he was.\" \n\nNew York: Massing and Gumperz traveled to the United States in August 1926. Arriving in New York City, they socialized with their American communist counterparts. They met Kenneth Durant, Mike Gold, and Helen Black (representative of the Soviet Photo Agency and in 1931 contributing editor to the \"New Masses\" when Whittaker Chambers began submitting short stories). They traveled to Mill Valley, CA, then traveled to Los Angeles and Pasadena (where Gumperz met Upton Sinclair) before returning to New York. Money began running out. Mike Gold got Massing a job in Pleasantville, NY, at an orphanage; there, Massing first became interested in Freud and human behavior. Meantime, Gumperz decided to return to Germany to write his doctorate at the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt am Main. Before doing so, the two married in December 1927—US citizenship would save her life in Moscow in 1938.\n\nMoscow: Hede and Paul Massing became disillusioned with life in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin. \"In 1930 and 1931 everybody was hungry, had no clothes, no decent beds, no decent linen... True, there were some exceptions - the GPU (today the MVD) and the foreigners. It was also about this time when children were called upon to spy on their parents; to report negativism, derogatory remarks, religious inclinations, or religious services attended; to tell whether their mother really had been sick or had really just washed her clothes, cleaned her miserable dwelling, or even relaxed, instead of attending those endless, ludicrous meetings.\" \n\nNew York: Both Massings later were members of the NKVD apparatus and in the USA worked under the direction of a Soviet officer, \"Fred\" (Boris Bazarov), based in New York. Hede Massing was assigned several duties, including that of a courier between the United States and Europe.\n\nWhittaker Chambers reported to Valentin Markin separately from Massing. Alger Hiss was reporting to Chambers when Hiss and Massing met over dinner to discuss the recruitment of Noel Field.\n\nMassing died of emphysema in her home on Washington Square in New York City on Sunday, 8 March 1981.\n\n Massing said in her memoir that she had left the Soviet intelligence apparatus in the late 1930s after a period of disillusionment with her Russian handlers and the Stalinist trials. Her intelligence work only ended with the war and in 1949 she came clean and testified at the second trial of Alger Hiss.\n\nThe cover name \"Redhead\" appears in Venona as an unidentified person in a context that suggests that it was Hede Massing, and she was identified as Massing.\n\nMembers of the Redhead group in the \"Gorsky Memo\":\n\n Hede Massing had first met Richard Sorge at the Marxist Workweek in 1923 that led to the establishment of the Frankfurt School. Sorge later recruited her to the Soviet underground, introducing her to Ignace Reiss. In her autobiography \"This Deception\", she wrote about Sorge and a meeting they had in New York in 1935. In an essay for the \"Neue Rundschau\" in 1953, \"Richard Sorge: der fast vollkommene Spion\" she called him a \"near-perfect spy.\"\n\nMassing was an employee of the Amtorg Trading Corporation.\n\n\n"}

It was published in 1965, but was written years earlier, around the time \"On the Road\" was in the process of publication. According to the book's foreword, the opening section of the novel is taken almost directly from the journal he kept when he was a fire lookout on Desolation Peak in the North Cascade mountains of Washington state. Much of the psychological struggle which the novel's protagonist, Jack Duluoz, undergoes in the novel reflects Kerouac's own increasing disenchantment with the Buddhist philosophy with which he had previously been fascinated.\n\nAll of Kerouac's Duluoz legend's characters were based on others that were present within his life.\n\nKerouac was not particularly conscientious about masking the identities of his friends in this work. Partway through Chapter 91, there is the line, \"'Who wants to ride freight trains!' -Gregory- 'I dont dig all this crap where you ride freight trains and have to exchange butts with bums-'\". Somehow both Kerouac and the editors missed that \"Gregory\" was not changed to \"Raphael\". Similarly, the locals of Tangiers call Old Bull Hubbard (Burroughs) \"Boorows\" in Chapter 52 of Book 2. In Chapter 43, he refers to \"...the Sundays in Neal Cassady's writings...\" The editors may have ignored this, since it refers to Neal as a writer instead of a friend. In Part 1 of Book 2 the locals are said to call Old Bull Gaines (Garver) \"Senor Gahr-va\". And in Chapter 80, the discussion of the meanings of Urso and Pomeray's names leads to a less than clear comparison to the name Corso.\n\nThe book is broken up into two sections called \"Desolation Angels\" and \"Passing Through\", which are then subdivided into many shorter parts. Each part focuses on a specific location where Kerouac is at that time. The first section covers Kerouac's time on the mountain and immediately after he leaves the fire lookout. The foreword of the book mentions that Kerouac was hoping to get the second section, \"Passing Through\", published as a standalone novel.\n\n"}

The Leather Apron Club's purpose was to debate questions of morals, politics, and natural philosophy, and to exchange knowledge of business affairs.\n\nFranklin organized a group of friends to provide a structured form of mutual improvement. The group, initially composed of twelve members, called itself the Junto (from the Spanish word \"junta\", or assembly). The members of the Junto were drawn from diverse occupations and backgrounds, but they all shared a spirit of inquiry and a desire to improve themselves, their community, and to help others. Among the original members were printers, surveyors, a cabinetmaker, a clerk, and a bartender. Although most of the members were older than Benjamin Franklin, he was clearly their leader.\n\nAt just 21, he oversaw five men, including Hugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb, who were soon to form the core of the Junto. Franklin was an outgoing, social individual and had become acquainted with these businessmen. This gathering included prominent merchants who met informally to drink and discuss the business of the day. Franklin's congenial ways attracted many unique and learned individuals, and from these, he selected the members for the Junto.\n\nAll members lived in Philadelphia and came from diverse areas of interest and business. Along with Meredith, Potts, and Webb, they included Joseph Breintnall, merchant and scrivener, who also loved poetry and natural history. Thomas Godfrey was a glazier, mathematician, and inventor; and Nicholas Scull and William Parsons were both surveyors. Scull was also a bibliophile and Parsons a cobbler and astrologer. William Maugridge was a cabinetmaker, William Coleman a merchant's clerk, and Robert Grace a gentleman. Grace's wealth meant he did not have to work, but apparently he brought an intellectual element to the group and a fine library. The twelfth member of the Junto remained a mystery until 2007, when Professor George Boudreau of Penn State discovered a long-forgotten account of the club's refreshments, and verified that shoemaker John Jones Jr. was an original member. Jones was a Philadelphia Quaker, a neighbor of Franklin's, and later a founding member of the Library Company of Philadelphia. The club met Friday nights, first in a tavern and later in a house, to discuss moral, political, and scientific topics of the day.\n\nFranklin describes the formation and purpose of the Junto in his autobiography:\n\nFranklin was influenced by two predecessor organizations in particular.\n\nOne was an English group called the \"Dry Club,\" which had philosopher John Locke, William Popple, and Benjamin Furly among its members during the 1690s (and was itself partially inspired by Furly's \"heretics of the Lantern\" society). It met one evening a week for two hours at a time and required that its members reply affirmatively to the following questions:\nEach member of the club would take turns proposing topics for discussion and moderating these discussions. The discussions were to be held in a spirit of open-minded tolerance:\n\nThat no Person or Opinion be unhandsomely reflected on; but every Member behave himself with all the temper, judgement, modesty, and discretion he is master of.\n\nThe other important predecessors were the \"neighborhood benefit societies\" and \"reforming societies\" proposed in Massachusetts by Cotton Mather. Cotton Mather described the neighborhood societies as being composed of a dozen married couples who would meet at one anothers' homes in succession for prayer and other religious exercises, and also to consider questions like the following:\nThe similar reforming societies would entertain questions like these:\nThe Junto's Friday evening meetings were organized around a series of questions that Franklin devised, covering a range of intellectual, personal, business, and community topics. These questions were used as a springboard for discussion and community action. In fact, through the Junto, Franklin promoted such concepts as volunteer fire-fighting clubs, improved security (night watchmen), and a public hospital.\n\nThis is the list of questions Franklin devised to guide the discussions at Junto meetings (from Franklin's papers, dated 1728, and included in some editions of his autobiography):\n\nAny person to be qualified as a member was to stand up, lay his hand upon his chest, over his heart, and be asked the following questions, viz.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1935145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935145", "title": "Adpositional phrase", "text": "Adpositional phrase\n\nAn adpositional phrase, in linguistics, is a syntactic category that includes \"prepositional phrases\", \"postpositional phrases\", and \"circumpositional phrases\". Adpositional phrases contain an adposition (preposition, postposition, or circumposition) as head and usually a complement such as a noun phrase. Language syntax treats adpositional phrases as units that act as arguments or adjuncts. Prepositional and postpositional phrases differ by the order of the words used. Languages that are primarily head-initial such as English predominantly use prepositional phrases whereas head-final languages predominantly employ postpositional phrases. Many languages have both types, as well as circumpositional phrases.\n\nThere are three types of adpositional phrases: prepositional phrases, postpositional phrases, and circumpositional phrases.\n\nThe underlined phrases in the following sentences are examples of prepositional phrases in English. The prepositions are in bold:\n\nPrepositional phrases have a preposition as the central element of the phrase, i.e. as the head of the phrase. The remaining part of the phrase is called the prepositional complement, or sometimes the \"object\" of the preposition. In English and many other Indo-European languages it takes the form of a noun phrase, such as a noun, pronoun, or gerund, possibly with one or more modifiers.\n\nA prepositional phrase can function as an adjective or adverb.\n\nPostpositional elements are frequent in head-final languages such as Basque, Estonian, Finnish, Georgian, Korean, Japanese, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Tamil. The word or other morpheme that corresponds to an English preposition occurs after its complement, hence the name \"post\"position. The following examples are from Japanese, where the case markers perform a role similar to that of adpositions:\n\nAnd from Finnish, where the case endings perform a role similar to that of adpositions:\n\nWhile English is generally seen as lacking postpositions entirely, there are a couple of words that one can in fact view as postpositions, e.g. \"the crisis two years ago\", \"sleep the whole night through\". Since a phrase like \"two years ago\" distributes just like a prepositional phrase, one can argue that \"ago\" should be classified as a postposition, as opposed to as an adjective or adverb.\n\nCircumpositional phrases involve both a preposition and a postposition, whereby the complement appears between the two. Circumpositions are common in Pashto and Kurdish. English has at least one circumpositional construction, e.g. \n\nGerman has more of them, e.g.\n\nLike with all other types of phrases, theories of syntax render the syntactic structure of adpositional phrases using trees. The trees that follow represent adpositional phrases according to two modern conventions for rendering sentence structure, first in terms of the constituency relation of phrase structure grammars and then in terms of the dependency relation of dependency grammars. The following labels are used on the nodes in the trees: Adv = adverb, N = nominal (noun or pronoun), P = preposition/postposition, and PP = pre/postpositional phrase: \n\nThese phrases are identified as prepositional phrases by the placement of PP at the top of the constituency trees and of P at the top of the dependency trees. English also has a number of two-part prepositional phrases, i.e. phrases that can be viewed as containing two prepositions, e.g.\n\nAssuming that \"ago\" in English is indeed a postposition as suggested above, a typical ago-phrase would receive the following structural analyses:\n\nThe analysis of circumpositional phrases is not so clear, since it is not obvious which of the two adpositions should be viewed as the head of the phrase. However, the following analyses are more in line with the fact that English is primarily a head-initial language:\n\nThe distribution of prepositional phrases in English can be characterized in terms of heads and dependents. Prepositional phrases typically appear as postdependents of nouns, adjectives, and finite and non-finite verbs, although they can also appear as predependents of finite verbs, for instance when they initiate clauses. For ease of presentation, just dependency trees are now employed to illustrate these points. The following trees show prepositional phrases as postdependents of nouns and adjectives:\n\nAnd the following trees show prepositional phrases as postdependents of non-finite verbs and as predependents of finite verbs:\n\nAttempts to position a prepositional phrase in front of its head noun, adjective, or non-finite verb are bad, e.g.\n\nThe b-examples demonstrate that prepositional phrases in English prefer to appear as postdependents of their heads. The fact, however, that they can at times appear as a predependent of their head (as in the finite clauses above) is curious.\n\nMore often than not, a given adpositional phrase is an adjunct in the clause or noun phrase that it appears in. These phrases can also, however, function as arguments, in which case they are known as \"oblique\": \n\nA prepositional phrase should not be confused with a sequence formed by the particle and the direct object of a phrasal verb. Phrasal verbs often consist of a verb and a particle, whereby the particle is mistakenly interpreted to be a preposition, e.g.\n\nParticles are identified by shifting, i.e. the particle can switch places with the object when the object is a pronoun. Prepositions cannot do this, i.e. they cannot switch positions with their complement, e.g. \"He is relying on Susan\" vs. \"*He is relying her on\".\n\n"}

It is a secular public school administered by the York Region District School Board. The school is located at 2001 King Road, and the current principal is Joseph D'Amico. The school day runs from 08:20 to 14:30.\n\nA French immersion program will be established at the school beginning in September 2019.\n\nKCSS is located on a campus of about 18 acres across the street from the King City branch of King Township Public Library. Twelve acres of the property were owned by James Gillies as early as 1917, and sold by Ralph and Alma Gillies on 3 March 1960 to the Aurora District High School Board for . The six acres on the eastern part of the campus were purchased from the Albon family of Clearwater, Florida for on 28 August 1962.\n\nDesigns for the building were created by the company Boigon and Associates, and the Toronto-based company Cullen Construction Company undertook construction of the main building, which began in 1960 and was completed for the September 1961 opening of the King City Composite School. Before it opened, students resident in King attended Aurora High School, which was renamed Dr. G.W. Williams Secondary School the year KCSS opened.\n\nThe school was not officially opened until a ceremony on 6 April 1962 at which M.A. Cullen presented the school's vice-principal John Turchin with an engraved key and school board representative Marvin Hunter donated a bible to the school. Major renovations to the building were implemented that year, funded with a grant from the Government of Canada and from the Government of Ontario. This resulted in the addition of a teacher's cafeteria in 1962 and a technical studies area in 1963, often referred to as the \"Tech Wing\", on the southwestern part of the school. In 1966, a third gymnasium and a library were added as an eastern wing to the main building. In 1983, the school's heating system was converted to use natural gas instead of oil, partly spurred by concerns of the expected cost of heating the large structure after the 1970s energy crisis. In 1991, a new library facility was constructed adjacent to the Tech Wing, which also resulted in the creation of an inner courtyard. The north courtyard was converted to a student memorial. In 2007, construction of a new science department was completed.\n\nThe school has an outdoor 400 m track, which encircles a Canadian football field, on the western part of its campus, and a soccer pitch on the eastern part of its campus. Both fields serve multiple functions, including lacrosse, track and field, rugby union and field hockey. During the summer, they are used by youth sports leagues in King City. From the summer of 2011 to the end of the 2011-2012 school year, the west field was redeveloped. New grass was added, the track was repaved, a fence installed around it, and multi-use goal posts suitable for football, soccer, and field hockey were installed.\n\nKCSS serves a geographically large area, since there are many sparsely populated communities in that area. Student enrollment has ranged from 750 to 1600. The primary boundary is similar to the township boundaries for King, though a small area in the northeast of King is served by schools in Aurora. Additionally, the eastern part of Oak Ridges, west of Yonge Street to the King town line, and parts of northern Vaughan, including Maple and Kleinburg and nearby communities, are served by KCSS.\n\nIn 2006, the student body comprised residents from the following communities:\n\nIts current boundaries are all King township, and a portion of Oak Ridges west of Yonge Street south of 15th Sideroad.\n\nKing City Secondary School follows the curriculum standards set by the Ontario Ministry of Education. Additionally, the school offers:\n\nKing City Secondary School is a semestered school; for each of the fall and winter semesters, students register for up to four courses. Each day has four 75-minute periods, with a lunch period between the second and third academic periods.\n\nOn the Education Quality and Accountability Office mathematics evaluation, 88% of the school's grade 9 students in the academic track (that is, those intending to pursue tertiary education) and 49% of those in the applied track met the standard.\n\nKing City Secondary School had an annual Marine Biology Science Trip to the Florida Keys. Established in 1990, the goal of the field trip is to demonstrate to students the relationship between ecosystems and human activity. The trip is part of the Independent Studies Program (ISP) for some senior science students, and every student is required to take daily tests and complete assignments throughout the trip.\n\nThe school has installed solar panels which connect with the school's primary power distribution system as part of a grade 10 project. This project was conducted as part of the University of Toronto \"Sustainable Toronto\" program, in conjunction with Ontario Power Generation. The solar panels also operate a pump connected to a man-made pond on the school grounds.\n\nKing City has an active drama program. In November of each year the school holds the Arthur B. Toast festival, a student-directed one-act play, often referred to as \"Toast\". Between 8 and 15 modern plays are performed, from comedy to drama to a little bizarre, involving around 70 students. Some of the plays are written by students.\n\nIn the spring, a more traditional play is performed to offer students the experience. Again, a large number of students are involved as actors, tech crew, stage crew, set design, makeup and costuming, and publicists. Matinees are held for the local feeder schools.\n\nBoth of these are open to the public and members of the community are encouraged to come and support a group of incredible kids. Information about these events is available by calling the school and performances are covered by 'The King Weekly'. Performances can be arranged at other settings such as retirement homes, shelters and other community homes.\n\nSports teams from KCSS are part of the York Region Athletics Association, which coordinates all competitive sports activities in York Region.\n\nKCSS competes and has competed in various sports including:\n\nNon-competitive school intramural sports leagues, organized and scheduled by the \"Athletic Council\" and senior physical and health education students, have active participation. Most events occur during the lunch period.\n\nThe school's football teams are known as the \"Lions\". The junior team won the York Region championship in the 2007-2008, 2008-2009, 2009–2010 and 2014-2015.\n\nIn 1988, the school established a Talented Athlete Program, which enabled student athletes at high levels of competition to arrange a flexible study program. Initially, fifteen athletes were identified for selection to the program, primarily those with intention to succeed to national competition. It was one of several schools in the region to establish such a program; that same year, Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute in Scarborough had established the Scarborough Centre for Exceptional Athletes. By 1992, other schools in the YRDSB operating a talented athlete program were Markham District High School, Thornhill Secondary School, and Thornlea Secondary School.\n\nKing City Secondary School has a number of clubs for its students to join. Each club is formed by teachers who take their own time to give to the students, usually at lunch and sometimes after school, or even out of school.\n\nGeorge Papandreou graduated from King City Secondary School in 1970, which he attended only in his final year of secondary education. He served as Prime Minister of Greece, is the son and grandson of former Greek prime ministers, and was the Foreign Minister of Greece from 1999 to 2004. He was the leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) from 2004 to 2012.\n\nRasmus Lerdorf, original author of the PHP programming language, graduated from KCSS in 1988 and was an Ontario Scholar.\n\nRick Hampton, a retired NHL hockey player, graduated from KCSS in 1975.\n\nKeith Glass, founded the country and bluegrass band Prairie Oyster in 1974, graduated from KCSS in 1972.\n\nJeff O'Neill, a retired NHL hockey player, graduated from KCSS in the mid-1990s.\n\nMarc Costanzo, a record producer, artist, musician and songwriter graduated from KCSS in the early 1990s.\n\nRosie MacLennan, Canadian trampoline gymnast and Olympic gold medalist for Canada at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England where she won in the individual event. Graduated from KCSS in 2006.\n\nNick Shortill CFL Linebacker and McMaster University Alumni, attended and graduated from KCSS in 2010\nThe KCSS Alumni Association has organized school reunions quinquennially (every five years) since 1986, and has presented a student from each graduating class with a bursary of $300 since 1988. In 2002, it established a \"Case of Distinction\" to honour former students who have made outstanding contributions or achievements locally, nationally, or internationally.\n\nThe 1995 movie \"To Die For\" had a number of scenes shot at King City Secondary School. KCSS appeared as \"Little Hope High School\" in the movie. One scene featured what is now a French classroom (southeast corner of 2nd floor) as the set for the Nicole Kidman classroom scene in the movie. A lottery was held for $2 per ticket to determine which attending students would be cast as extras in the scenes filmed at the school.\n\nWalt Disney's \"Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen\", which debuted in 2004, also had some scenes filmed during a three-day period in July 2003 at King City Secondary School. The revenue generated from the filming rights of this movie assured sufficient capital for the construction of a new music room.\n\n\n"}

He was best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation from 1986 to 1987 and with World Championship Wrestling from 1989 to 1994, as well for his tours of Japan with All Japan Pro Wrestling.\n\nZenk was born in Golden Valley, Minnesota. He attended Robbinsdale High School in Robbinsdale, Minnesota. His 1976 graduating class included fellow future professional wrestlers Brady Boone, Barry Darsow, Curt Hennig, Nikita Koloff, and Rick Rude. He attended the University of Minnesota, where he majored in speech communications.\n\nZenk competed as a bodybuilder. In October 1980, he competed in the \"Mr. North Country\" competition, placing third. In July 1981, he participated in the \"Mr. Minnesota\" competition, winning championships in the overall, heavyweight, and \"most muscular\" divisions.\n\nZenk was introduced to professional wrestling by Road Warrior Animal, who he met at a bodybuilding contest. He was trained to wrestle by Brad Rheingans and Eddie Sharkey. He debuted in early 1984 with Mid-South Wrestling in Louisiana. In mid-1984, Zenk joined the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based American Wrestling Association, where he performed as an undercard wrestler until September 1985. He was named Rookie of the Year for 1984 by the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\", tying with Jushin Liger.\n\nIn October 1985, Zenk joined the Portland, Oregon-based Pacific Northwest Wrestling promotion, where he received a push. In December 1985, he and Scott Doring won the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship. They lost the Championship to Bobby Jaggers and Rip Oliver the following month. In the same month, Zenk defeated Jaggers for the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship. He held the Championship until March 1986, when Jaggers regained it.

{"id": "1935154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935154", "title": "History of the Jews in Tunisia", "text": "History of the Jews in Tunisia\n\nThe history of the Jews in Tunisia extends over nearly two thousand years and goes back to the Punic era. The Jewish community in Tunisia is no doubt older, grew up following successive waves of immigration and proselytism before its development was hampered by anti-Jewish measures in the Byzantine Empire. The community formerly used its own dialect of Arabic. After the Muslim conquest of Tunisia, Tunisian Judaism went through periods of relative freedom or even cultural apogee to times of more marked discrimination. The arrival of Jews expelled from the Iberian peninsula, often through Livorno, greatly altered the country. Its economic, social and cultural situation has improved markedly with the advent of the French protectorate before being compromised during the Second World War, with the occupation of the country by the Axis. The creation of Israel in 1948 provoked a widespread anti-Zionist reaction in the Arab world, to which was added nationalist agitation, nationalization of enterprises, Arabization of education and part of the administration. Jews left Tunisia en masse from the 1950s onwards because of the problems raised and the hostile climate created by the Bizerte crisis in 1961 and the Six-Day War in 1967. The Jewish population of Tunisia, estimated at about 105,000 individuals in 1948, numbered just 1,100 individuals as of 2018, about 1% of the 1948 population. These Jews lived mainly in Tunis, with communities present in Djerba.\n\nThe Jewish diaspora of Tunisia is divided between Israel and France, where it has preserved its community identity through its traditions, mostly dependent on Sephardic Judaism, but retaining its own specific characteristics. Djerbian Judaism in particular, considered to be more faithful to tradition because it remained outside the sphere of influence of the modernist currents, plays a dominant role. The vast majority of Tunisian Jews have relocated to Israel and have switched to using Hebrew as their home language. typically use French as their first language, while the few still left in Tunisia tend to use either French or Judeo-Tunisian Arabic in their everyday lives.\n\nThe history of the Jews of Tunisia (until the establishment of the French protectorate) was first studied by David Cazès in 1888 in his Essay on the History of the Israelites of Tunisia; André Chouraqui(1952) and later by Haim Zeev Hirschberg(1965), in the more general context of North African Judaism. The research on the subject was then enriched by Robert Attal and Yitzhak Avrahami. In addition, various institutions, including the Israel Folktale Archives in University of Haifa, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Ben Zvi Institute, collect material evidence (traditional clothing, embroidery, Lace, jewelry, etc.), traditions (folk tales, liturgical songs, etc.) and manuscripts as well as Judeo-Arabic books and newspapers.\nPaul Sebag is the first to provide in his History of the Jews of Tunisia: from origins to our days (1991) a first development entirely devoted to the history of this community. In Tunisia, following the thesis of Abdelkrim Allagui, a group under the direction of Habib Kazdaghli and Abdelhamid Largueche brings the subject into the field of national academic research. Founded in Paris on June 3, 1997, the Society of Jewish History of Tunisia contributes to the research on the Jews of Tunisia and transmits their history through conferences, symposia and exhibitions.\n\nAccording to Michel Abitbol, the study of Judaism in Tunisia has grown rapidly during the progressive dissolution of the Jewish community in the context of decolonization and the evolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict while Habib Kazdaghli believes that the departure of the Jewish community is the cause of the low number of studies related to the topic. Kazdaghli, however, points out that their production increases since the 1990s, due to the authors attached to this community, and that the associations of Jews originating from one or another community (Ariana, Bizerte, etc.) or Tunisia multiply. As for the fate of the Jewish community during the period of the German occupation of Tunisia (1942–1943), it remains relatively uncommon, and the Symposium on the Jewish Community of Tunisia held at the University of La Manouba in February 1998 (the first of its kind on this research theme) does not mention it. However, the work of memory of the community exists, with the testimonies of Robert Borgel and Paul Ghez, the novels \"The Statue of Salt\" by Albert Memmi and Villa Jasmin by Serge Moati as well as the works of some historians.\n\nLike many Jewish populations, such as in Tripolitania and Spain, the Tunisian Jews claim a very old implantation on their territory. However, there is no record of their presence before the second century. Among the assumptions:\nHowever, if these hypotheses were verified, it is probable that these Israelites would have assimilated to the Punic population and sacrificed to their divinities, like Baal and Tanit. Thereafter, Jews from Alexandria or Cyrene could have settled in Carthage following the Hellenization of the eastern part of the Mediterranean Basin. The cultural context allowed them to practice Judaism more in keeping with ancestral traditions. Small Jewish communities existed in the later days of Punic domination over North Africa, without it being possible to say whether they developed or disappeared later.\nJews have in any case settled in the new Roman province of Africa, enjoying the favors of Julius Caesar. The latter, in recognition of the support of King Antipater in his struggle against Pompey, recognized Judaism and the status of Religio licita, and according to Josephus granted the Jews a privileged status confirmed by the Magna Charta pro Judaeis under the Roman Empire. These Jews were joined by Jewish pilgrims, expelled from Rome for proselytizing, 20 by a number of defeated in the First Jewish–Roman War, deported and resold as slaves in North Africa, and also by Jews fleeing the repression of revolts in Cyrenaica and Judea under the reigns of the emperors Domitian, Trajan, and Hadrian. It is very likely that these Jews founded communities on the territory of present-day Tunisia.\n\nA tradition among the descendants of the first Jewish settlers was that their ancestors settled in that part of North Africa long before the destruction of the First Temple in the 6th century BCE. The ruins of an ancient synagogue dating back to the 3rd–5th century CE was discovered by the French captain Ernest De Prudhomme in his Hammam-Lif residence in 1883 called in Latin as \"sancta synagoga naronitana\" (\"holy synagogue of Naro\"). After the fall of the Second Temple, many exiled Jews settled in Tunis and engaged in agriculture, cattle-raising, and trade. They were divided into clans governed by their respective heads (\"mokdem\"), and had to pay the Romans a capitation tax of 2 shekels. Under the dominion of the Romans and (after 429) of the fairly tolerant Vandals, the Jews of Tunis increased and prospered to such a degree that African Church councils deemed it necessary to enact restrictive laws against them. After the overthrow of the Vandals by Belisarius in 534, Justinian I issued his edict of persecution in which the Jews were classed with the Arians and the Pagans. As elsewhere in the Roman Empire, the Jews of Roman Africa were romanized after hundreds of years of subjection and would have adopted Latinized names, worn the toga, and spoken Latin.\n\nIn the 7th century, the Jewish population was augmented by Spanish immigrants, who, fleeing from the persecutions of the Visigothic king Sisebut and his successors, escaped to Mauritania and settled in Byzantine cities.\nAl-Qayrawani relates that at the time of the conquest of Hippo Zaritus (Arabic: \"Bizerta\") by Hasan ibn al-Nu'man in 698 the governor of that district was a Jew. When Tunis came under the dominion of the Arabs, or of the Arabian caliphate of Baghdad, another influx of Arabic-speaking Jews from the Levant into Tunis took place.\n\nThe first documents attesting to the presence of Jews in Tunisia date from the second century. Tertullian describes Jewish communities alongside which Pagan Jews of Punic, Roman and Berber origin and, initially, Christians; The success of Jewish proselytism led the pagan authorities to take legal measures, while Tertullian wrote a pamphlet against Judaism at the same time. On the other hand, the Talmud mention the existence of several Carthaginian rabbis. In addition, Alfred Louis Delattre demonstrates towards the end of the nineteenth century that the Gammarth necropolis, made up of 200 rock chambers, each containing up to 17 complex tombs (kokhim), contains Jewish symbols and funerary inscriptions in Hebrew, Latin and Greek. \n\nA synagogue of the 2nd or 4th century, is discovered in Naro (present Hammam Lif) in 1883. The mosaic covering the floor of the main hall, which includes a Latin inscription mentioning sancta synagoga naronitana (\"holy synagogue of Naro\") and motifs practiced throughout Roman Africa, testifies to the ease of its members and the quality of their exchanges with other populations.\nOther Jewish communities are attested by epigraphic or literary references to Utique, Chemtou, Hadrumète or Thusuros (present Tozeur). Like the other Jews of the empire, those of Roman Africa are Romanized more or less long, bear Latin or Latin names, sport the gown and speak Latin, even if they retain the knowledge of Greek, Of the Jewish diaspora at the time.\n\nAccording to St. Augustine, only their morals, modeled by Jewish religious precepts (circumcision, Kashrut, observance of Shabbat, modesty of dress), distinguish them from the rest of the population. On the intellectual level, they devote themselves to translation for Christian clients and to the study of the Law, many Rabbis were originally from Carthage. From an economic point of view, they worked in agriculture, livestock and trade. Their situation is modified from the edict of Milan (313) which legalized Christianity. Jews were gradually excluded from most public functions and proselytism was severely punished. The construction of new synagogues was forbidden towards the end of the fourth century and their maintenance without the agreement of the authorities, under a law of 423.\nHowever, various councils held by the Church of Carthage, recommending Christians not to follow certain practices of their Jewish neighbors, testify to the maintenance of their influence.\n\nAt the beginning of the 5th century the arrival of the Vandals has opened a period of respite for the Jews. The Arianism of the new masters of Roman Africa was closer to Jewish monotheism than the Catholicism of the Church Fathers. The Jews probably thrived economically, backing the Vandal kings against the armies of Emperor Justinian, who had set out to conquer North Africa.\n\nJustinian's victory in 535 opened the period of the Exarchate of Africa, which saw the persecution of the Jews with the Arians, the Donatists and the Gentiles. Stigmatized again, they are excluded from any public office, their synagogues are transformed into churches, their worship is proscribed and their meetings forbidden. The administration strictly applies the Codex Theodosianus against them, which allows the holding of forced conversions. If the emperor Maurice attempts to repeal these measures, his successors return there and an imperial edict imposes baptism on them.\n\nSome Jews have fled the Byzantine-controlled cities to settle in the mountains or on the confines of the desert and fight there with the support of the Berber tribes, many of whom would have been won by their proselytism. According to other historians, the Judaization of the Berbers would have taken place four centuries earlier, with the arrival of Jews fleeing the repression of the Cyrenaic revolt; The transition would have been made progressively through a Judeo-Pagan syncretism with the cult of Tanit, still anchored after the fall of Carthage. Whatever the hypothesis, the historian of the fourteenth century Ibn Khaldun confirms their existence on the eve of the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb on the basis of eleventh-century Arab chronicles. However, this version is fairly questioned: Haim Zeev Hirschberg recalls that the historian wrote his work several centuries after the facts, Mohamed Talbi that the French translation is not totally exact since it does not render the idea of the contingency expressed by the author, and Gabriel Camps that the Jarawa and Nefzaouas quoted were of Christian confession before the arrival of Islam.\n\nIn any case, even if the hypothesis of the massive conversion of whole tribes appears fragile, individual conversions seem more probable.\n\nWith the Arab conquest and the arrival of Islam in Tunisia in the eighth century, the \"People of the Book\" (including Jews and Christians) were given a choice between conversion to Islam (which some Jewish Berbers have done) and submission to the dhimma. The Dhimma is a pact of protection allowing the non-Muslims to practice their worship, to administer according to their laws and have their property and lives saved in return for the payment of the jizya, capitation tax levied on the free men, the wearing of distinctive clothing and the lack of construction of new places of worship. Moreover, dhimmis couldn't marry Muslim women – the reverse was possible if the Jewish wife converted and proselytized. They must also treat Muslims and Islam with respect and humility. Any violation of this pact resulted in expulsion or even death.\n\nJews were economically, culturally and linguistically integrated into society, while retaining their cultural and religious peculiarities. If it is slow, arabization is faster in urban areas, following the arrival of Jews from the East in the wake of the Arabs, and in the wealthy classes.\n\nIn 788, when Idris I of Morocco (Imam Idris) proclaimed Mauritania's independence of the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad, the Tunisian Jews joined his army under the leadership of their chief, Benjamin ben Joshaphat ben Abiezer. They soon withdrew, however; primarily because they were loath to fight against their coreligionists of other parts of Mauritania, who remained faithful to the caliphate of Baghdad; and secondarily, because of some indignities committed by Idris against Jewish women. The victorious Idris avenged this defection by attacking the Jews in their cities. The Jews were required to pay a capitation-tax and provide a certain number of virgins annually for Idris' harem. The Jewish tribe 'Ubaid Allah preferred to migrate to the east rather than to submit to Idris; according to a tradition, the Jews of the island of Djerba are the descendants of that tribe. In 793 Imam Idris was poisoned at the command of caliph Harun al-Rashid (it is said, by the governor's physician Shamma, probably a Jew), and circa 800 the Aghlabite dynasty was established. Under the rule of this dynasty, which lasted until 909, the situation of the Jews in Tunis was very favorable. As of old, Bizerta had a Jewish governor, and the political influence of the Jews made itself felt in the administration of the country. Especially prosperous at that time was the community of Kairwan (Kairouan), which was established soon after the foundation of that city by Uqba bin Nafi in the year 670.\n\nA period of reaction set in with the accession of the Zirite Al-Mu'izz (1016–62), who persecuted all heterodox sects, as well as the Jews. The persecution was especially detrimental to the prosperity of the Kairwan community, and members thereof began to emigrate to the city of Tunis, which speedily gained in population and in commercial importance.\n\nThe accession of the Almohad dynasty to the throne of the Maghreb provinces in 1146 proved disastrous to the Jews of Tunis. The first Almohad, 'Abd al-Mu'min, claimed that Muhammad had permitted the Jews free exercise of their religion for only five hundred years, and had declared that if, after that period, the messiah had not come, they were to be forced to embrace Islam. Accordingly, Jews as well as Christians were compelled either to embrace Islam or to leave the country. 'Abd al-Mu'min's successors pursued the same course, and their severe measures resulted either in emigration or in forcible conversions. Soon becoming suspicious of the sincerity of the new converts, the Almohadis compelled them to wear a special garb, with a yellow cloth for a head-covering.\n\nThe living conditions of the Jews were relatively favorable during the reign of the Aghlabids and then Fatimids dynasties. As evidenced by the archives of the Cairo Geniza, composed between 800 and 115041, the dhimma is practically limited to the jizya. Jews worked in the service of the dynasty, as treasurers, doctors or tax collectors but their situation remained precarious. Kairouan, now the capital of the Aghlabids, was the seat of the most important community in the territory, attracting migrants from Umayyad, Italy and the Abbasid Empire. This community would become one of the major poles of Judaism between the ninth and eleventh centuries, both economically, culturally and intellectually, ensuring, through correspondence with the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia, Lessons learned from Spain.\n\nMany major figures of Judaism are associated with the city. Among them is Isaac Israeli ben Solomon, a private doctor of the Aghlabide Ziadet Allah III and then of the Fatimids Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah and Al-Qa'im bi-Amr Allah and author of various medical treatises in Arabic which would enrich the medieval medicine through their translation by Constantine the African, adapting the teachings of the Alexandrian school to the Jewish dogma. Dunash ibn Tamim, is the author (or final editor) whose discipline is a philosophical commentary on the Sefer Yetzirah, where he developed conceptions close to his master's thought. Another disciple, Ishaq ibn Imran is considered the founder of the philosophical and medical school of Ifriqiya. Jacob ben Nissim ibn Shahin, rector of the Center of Studies at the end of the tenth century, is the official representative of the Talmudic academies of Babylonia, acting as intermediaries between them and his own community. His successor Chushiel ben Elchanan, originally from Bari, developed the simultaneous study of the Talmud of Babylon and the Jerusalem Talmud. His son and disciple Chananel ben Chushiel was one of the major commentators of the Talmud in the Middle Ages. After his death, his work was continued by another disciple of his father whom Ignác Goldziher calls Jewish {Muʿtazila|mutazilite}: Nissim ben Jacob, the only one among the sages of Kairouan to bear the title of Gaon, also wrote an important commentary on the Talmud and the Hibbour yafe mehayeshoua, which is perhaps the first tales collection in Jewish literature.\n\nOn the political level, the community emancipated itself from the exile of Baghdad at the beginning of the eleventh century and acquired its first secular chief. Each community was placed under the authority of a council of notables headed by a chief (naggid) who, through the faithful, disposes of the resources necessary for the proper functioning of the various institutions: worship, schools, a tribunal headed by the rabbi- Judge (dayan), etc. The naggid of Kairouan undoubtedly had the ascendancy over those of the communities of smaller size.\n\nThe Jews participate greatly in the exchanges with Al-Andalus, Egypt and the Middle East. Grouped in separate quarters (although many Jews settled in the Muslim districts of Kairouan during the Fatimid period), they had house of prayer, schools and a court.\nThe port cities of Mahdia, Sousse, Sfax and Gabès saw a steady influx of Jewish immigrants from the Levant to the end of the eleventh century, and their communities participated in these economic and intellectual exchanges. Monopolizing the goldsmiths' and jewelers' crafts, they also worked in the textile industry, as tailors, tanners and shoemakers, while the smallest rural communities practiced agriculture (saffron, henna, vine, etc.) or breeding of nomadic animals.\n\nThe departure of the Fatimids to Egypt in 972 led their Zirid vassals to seize power and eventually break their bonds of political and religious submission in the middle of the eleventh century. The Banu Hilal and the Banu Sulaym, were sent in retaliation against Tunisia by the Fatimids, took Kairouan in 1057 and plundered it, which empties it of all its population then plunges it into the doldrums. Combined with the triumph of Sunnism and the end of the Babylonian gaonate, these events marked the end of the Kairouan community and reversed the migratory flow of the Jewish populations towards the Levant, with the elites having already accompanied the Fatimid court in Cairo. Jews have migrated to the coastal cities of Gabes, Sfax, Mahdia, Sousse and Tunis, but also to Béjaïa, Tlemcen and Beni Hammad Fort.\n\nUnder the Hafsid dynasty, which was established in 1236 as a breakaway from the Almohad dynasty, the condition of the Jews greatly improved. Besides Kairwan, there were at that time important communities in Mehdia, Kalaa, the island of Djerba, and the city of Tunis. Considered at first as foreigners, the Jews were not permitted to settle in the interior of Tunis, but had to live in a building called a \"funduk\". Subsequently, however, a wealthy and humane Muslim, Sidi Mahrez, who in 1159 had rendered great services to the Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu'min, obtained for them the right to settle in a special quarter of the city. This quarter, called the \"Hira,\" constituted until 1857 the ghetto of Tunis; it was closed at night. In 1270, in consequence of the defeat of Louis IX of France, who had undertaken a crusade against Tunis, the cities of Kairwan and Ḥammat were declared holy; and the Jews were required either to leave them or to convert to Islam. From that year until the conquest of Tunis by France (1857), Jews and Christians were forbidden to pass a night in either of these cities; and only by special permission of the governor were they allowed to enter them during the day.\n\nThe rise of the Almohad Caliphate shaked both the Jewish communities of Tunisia and the Muslims attached to the cult of the saints, declared by the new sovereigns as heretics. Jews were forced to apostasy by Caliph Abd al-Mu'min. Many massacres took place, despite many formal conversions by the pronunciation of the Shahada. Indeed, many Jews, while outwardly professing Islam, remained faithful to their religion, which they observed in secret, as advocated by Rabbi Moses ben Maimon. Jewish practices disappeared from the Maghreb from 1165 to 1230; Still they were saddened by the sincere adherence of some to Islam, fears of persecution and the relativization of any religious affiliation. This Islamization of the morals and doctrines of the Jews of Tunisia, meant they as 'dhimmis' (after the disappearance of Christianity in the Maghreb around 1150) isolated from their other coreligionists, and was strongly criticized by the Maimonides.\n\nUnder the Hafsid dynasty, which emancipated from the Almohads and their religious doctrine in 1236, the Jews reconstituted the communities that existed before the Almohad period. The dhimma was strict, especially in matters of dress, but systematic persecution, social exclusion and hindrance to worship had disappeared. New trades appeared: carpenter, blacksmith, chiseler or soap-maker; Some worked in the service of power, striking money, collecting customs duties or translating.\n\nAlthough the difficulty of the economic context leads to a surge of probabilism, the triumph of Maliki Sunnism with little tolerance towards the \"people of the book\" meant material and spiritual misery. The massive settlement of Jewish-Spanish scholars fleeing from the Castile in 1391 and again in 1492 was mainly carried out in Algeria and Morocco, and the Tunisian Jews, abandoned by this phenomenon, were led to consult Algerian scholars such as Simeon ben Zemah Duran.\n\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries, the Jews of Tunis were treated more cruelly than those elsewhere in the Maghreb. While refugees from Spain and Portugal flocked to Algeria and Morocco, only some chose to settle in Tunis. The Tunisian Jews had no eminent rabbis or scholars and had to consult those of Algeria or Morocco on religious questions. In the fifteenth century, each community was autonomous – recognized by power from the moment it counts at least ten major men – and has its own institutions; Their communal affairs were directed by a chief (zaken ha-yehudim) nominated by the government, and assisted by a council of notables (gdolei ha-qahal) made up of the most educated and wealthy family heads. The chief's functions consisted in the administration of justice among the Jews and collection of Jewish taxes.\n\nThree kinds of taxes were imposed on Tunisian Jews:\n\nIn addition to these, every Jewish tradesman and industrialist had to pay an annual tax to the guild. After the 13th century, taxes were collected by a qaid, who also served as an intermediary between the government and the Jews. His authority within the Jewish community was supreme. The members of the council of elders, as well as the rabbis, were nominated at his recommendation, and no rabbinical decision was valid unless approved by him.\n\nDuring the conquest of Tunis by the Spaniards in 1535, many Jews were made prisoners and sold as slaves in several Christian countries. After the victory of the Ottomans over the Spaniards in 1574, Tunisia became a province of the Ottoman Empire led by deys, from 1591, then by beys, from 1640. In this context, Jews arriving from Italy have played an important role in the life of the country and in the history of Tunisian Judaism.\n\nDuring the Spanish occupation of the Tunisian coasts (1535–74) the Jewish communities of Bizerte, Susa, Sfax, and other seaports suffered greatly at the hands of the conquerors; while under the subsequent Turkish rule the Jews of Tunis enjoyed a fair amount of security. They were free to practice their religion and administer their own affairs. Nevertheless, they were subject to the caprices of princes and outbursts of fanaticism. Petty officials were allowed to impose upon them the most difficult drudgery without compensation. They were obliged to wear a special costume, consisting of a blue frock without collar or ordinary sleeves (loose linen sleeves being substituted), wide linen drawers, black slippers, and a small black skull-cap; stockings might be worn in winter only. They might ride only on asses or mules, and were not permitted to use a saddle.\n\nFrom the 16th century Tunisia and more particularly Tunis had an influx of Jewish families of Spanish origin, who initially settled in Livorno (Tuscany, Italy), and who later moved to work in other trading centers. These new settlers, called \"granas\" in Arabic or \"gorneyim\" (גורנים) in Hebrew after the name of the city in both languages, were wealthier than the Jewish natives called \"touensa\". They spoke and wrote in Italian but gradually adopted the local Arabic while introducing their traditional liturgy in their newly host country.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 18th century the political status of the Jews in Tunis improved. This was due to the increasing influence of the political agents of the European powers, who, while seeking to ameliorate the condition of the Christian residents, had to plead also the cause of the Jews, whom Muslim legislation classed with Christians. Haim Joseph David Azulai, who visited Tunis in 1772, praised this development. In 1819, the United States consul in Tunis, Mordecai Manuel Noah, gave the following account of the situation of the Tunisian Jews:\n\n\"\"With all the apparent oppression, the Jews are the leading men; they are in Barbary the principal mechanics, they are at the head of the custom-house, they farm the revenues; the exportation of various articles, and the monopoly of various merchandise, are secured to them by purchase, they control the mint and regulate the coinage of money, they keep the bey's jewels and valuable articles, and are his treasurers, secretaries, and interpreters; the little known of arts, science, and medicine is confined to the Jews. If a Jew commits a crime, if the punishment affects his life, these people, so national, always purchase his pardon; the disgrace of one affects the whole community; they are ever in the presence of the bey, every minister has two or three Jewish agents, and when they unite to attain an object, it cannot be prevented. These people, then, whatever may be said of their oppression, possess a very controlling influence, their friendship is worthy of being preserved by public functionaries, and their opposition is to be dreaded.\"\"\n\nMarrano families, which have been settling in Livorno from the end of the fifteenth century, converted back to Judaism\nat the beginning of the seventeenth century, and left Tuscany to settle in Tunisia, in the framework of the establishment of commercial relations. These new arrivals, called 'Granas' in Arabic and 'Gorneyim' (גורנים) in Hebrew, were richer and less numerous than their indigenous coreligionists, called 'Twansa'. They spoke and wrote Tuscan and sometimes Spanish, and constituted a highly influential economic and cultural elite in the rest of the Italian community. Their surnames recalled their Spanish or Portuguese origin.\n\nQuickly introduced to the Beylic Court, they performed executive functions of court – collectors of taxes, treasurers and intermediaries without authority over Muslims – and noble professions in medicine, finance or diplomacy. Even if they settled in the same neighborhoods, they had virtually no connection with the Twansa, to which Jews from the rest of the Mediterranean Basin have assimilated. The Twansa spoke the Judeo-Tunisian dialect, and occupied a modest social position. This is why, contrary to what was happening elsewhere in the Maghreb, these new populations were hardly accepted, which gradually leads to the division of the Jewish community into two groups.\n\nIn this context, the Jews played a major role in the economic life of the country, in commerce and crafts, but also in trading and banking. Despite the tariffs being higher than those paid by Muslim or Christian traders (10% vs. 3%), the Granas managed to control and prosper trade with Livorno. Their trading houses also engaged in credit banking activities and participated in the purchase of Christian slaves captured by privateers and resold. The Twansa saw themselves conceding the monopoly of the leather trade by the Muradid and then Husainid beys. Jews who were traveling as Tunisians worked in the retail trade in the souks of Tunis, thus shipping imported products from Europe under the leadership of a Muslim amine, or in the Jewish quarter.\n\nIn 1710, a century of friction between the two groups led to a coup de force of the Livornese community, with a tacit agreement of the authorities. By creating its own community institutions, it creates a schism with the indigenous population. Each of them had their council of notables, their grand rabbi, their rabbinical court, synagogues, schools, butcher's shop and a separate cemetery. This state of affairs was endorsed by a taqqana (rabbinic decree) signed in July 1741 between the great rabbis Abraham Taïeb and Isaac Lumbroso. This agreement was renewed in 1784 before being annulled in 1899. This taqqana sets, among other rules, the fact that every Israelite from a Muslim country was attached to the Twansa, while every Israelite from a Christian country was from the Granas. Moreover, the Granas – a richer community, although only 8% of the total population – then accounted for one third of the payment of the jizya against two-thirds for the Twansa. This last point indicated that the Livornese community, previously protected by the European consuls, has sufficiently integrated into Tunisia so that its members were considered dhimmis and taxed like the Twansa.\n\nThe socio-cultural and economic differences between these two communities have increased in the nineteenth century. The Granas, due to their European origins and higher standard of living, but also to their economic, family and cultural ties with Livorno, found it difficult to cope with their indigenous coreligionists, the Twansa, who were considered less \"civilized\". The Granas were an important contributions whereas they represented only a minority of the Jews of Tunisia. On the other hand, indigenous elites didn't wish to give up their power to newcomers, unlike their Maghreb neighbors, probably due to the later arrival of the Granas in Tunisia. The Granas also differed geographically from the Twansa, settling in the European district of Tunis, thus avoiding the Hara, and more culturally approach the Europeans than their co-religionists. However, the two groups keep the same rites and uses with only a few variants and, outside Tunis, the same community institutions continue to serve all the faithful. Moreover, all the Jews remain under the authority of a single qaid chosen from the Twansa, presumably to avoid interference with foreigners.\n\nDuring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Jews were still subjected to bullying and discriminatory measures, particularly on the part of the judicial system which was arbitrary in their regard, with the exception of the more tolerant Hanafi courts. Jews were still subjected to the collective payment of the jizya – the annual amount of which varied according to the year, from 10,332 piastres in 1756 to 4,572 piastres in 1806 – and had to pay additional taxes (ghrâma) whenever the sovereign's treasury was in difficulty, as the Muslims sometimes did. Moreover, they were periodically obliged to carry out public works and were subjected to forced labor which affected mainly the poorest of the communities. Regarding dress code, the chechia that served as their headdress had to be black and wrapped in a dark turban, unlike the Muslims who wore a red chechia surrounded by a white turban. The Granas, dressed in European fashion, wore wigs and round hats like Christian merchants.\n\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century, the political status of the Jews improved somewhat thanks to the growing influence of the political agents of the European powers who, seeking to improve the living conditions of the Christian residents, also pleaded the Jews. But if the wealthy Jews – who held positions in administration or trade – succeeded in being respected, especially through the protection of influential Muslim personalities, poor Jews were often victims of bullying and even murder, and the authorities didn't seem to intervene. An observer declared that the Jews were recognized \"not only in their black costume, but also in the imprint of a curse they carry on their foreheads\".\n\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, Hammouda Pasha denied Jews the right to acquire and possess real estate properties, while the learning of literal Arabic and the use of the Arabic alphabet was also prohibited during this period. Finally, the behavior of the Muslim population towards the communities varied from the will to rigorous application of the dhimma by the Ulama to the absence of hostility of the rural population, marginalized urban fringes but assured of impunity.\n\nCommunities were structured under the authority of a leader of the \"Jewish nation\" with the title of hasar ve ha-tafsar, a prestigious and powerful post containing both the qaid charge of the Jews (qdyd el yihud) and that of Receiver General of Finance under the authority of the Treasurer of the Kingdom (khaznadar). He was an intermediary between the bey and his community and therefore enjoed entry to the court. He had a very important bureaucratic power over those coreligionaries in whom he apportioned the payment of the jizya – of which they were collectively liable – according to the resources of each household. It also refers to those who performed the duties imposed by the authorities.\n\nA state farmer, surrounded by some of the most fortunate and educated notables, also collected taxes such as the tithes, the tax on kosher meat and the offerings of the faithful. These allow him to pay for his services, those of his deputies and the rabbis-judges104 and finance the synagogues, the schools linked to them, the ritual abattoir, the cemetery, the relief fund for the needy and the sick and the rabbinical court, which were only in large cities under the presidency of the Grand Rabbi. Administrator of the affairs of the community designated the local secular or religious leaders – with the written approval of the Tunisian authorities – and gives them broad orientations. From the reign of Abu l-Hasan Ali I(1735–1756), he also served as treasurer of the Bey and many of the key posts in the administration of finance – collection of taxes and customs duties, scheduling of expenditure, Handling of cash, keeping books of account or paying the salaries of the Janissaries – were occupied by Jewish agents.\n\nDespite the split between the groups, the figure of the Grand Rabbi had considerable authority among his followers. By virtue of his function as president of the rabbinical court, he watches over Jewish law, relying on the Shulchan Aruch, the standard legislative code, and the Talmud. The rabbinic jurisdictions deal with personal status matters, but also with civil and commercial cases when only Jews were concerned, whether the faults were religious or secular. In small towns, the dayan was responsible for rendering justice, with the rabbinical court serving as a chamber of appeal. One of the most rigorous penalties that the latter could pronounce was the herem, the Jewish version of excommunication, made public in the synagogue.\n\nHowever, some questioned the authority of the religious leaders: a Jewish broker, working for a French trading house and condemned to beating in May 1827 for invoking the name of God, appealed the decision to the consul of France. Following the protest of the latter to the bey, it was decided that the rabbinical court would no longer pronounce sentence for religious offense to a Jew placed under French protection.\n\nOn the intellectual level, the growing exchanges between Jews from Tunisia and Livorno facilitated the circulation of printed works in Tuscany and their widespread distribution in Tunisia and the rest of the Maghreb. This led to an important revival of the Tunisian Hebrew studies at the beginning of the eighteenth century, embodied in particular by the rabbis Semah Sarfati, Abraham Ha-Cohen, Abraham Benmoussa, Abraham Taïeb and Joseph Cohen-Tanugi. Among the works of the Chumash, the Talmud or the Kabbalah, which are of note, we can cite;\n\nWith the exception of Isaac Lumbroso's Zera Itshak, all the works were printed in Livorno, Tunis, which didn't have a well-known printing press, the only attempt to make one was in 1768 was considered a failure because of the lack of knowledge on the subject. Rabbi Chaim Yosef David Azulai, who visited Tunis in 1773–74, noted that the city had some 300 young talmudists and considered that the rabbis he met \"had very extensive knowledge\".\n\nBy the middle of the century, the Jews of Tunisia barely knew any literate Arabic, and few of them read and wrote Hebrew. In addition, they generally lived with their precepts, because of their only religious instruction and they have little knowledge of the Arab-Muslim letters, unlike the Jews of other Muslim countries. Nevertheless, the comings and goings between Tunis and Europe contributed to a certain desire for emancipation and freedom in wearing the clothes assigned to them; in January 1823 Mahmoud Bey has ordered all Jews living in Tunisia to wear a cap.\n\nOne Jew originally from Gibraltar who refuses to measure, was the victim of a bastinado; His protest to his consul led to a strong reaction from the United Kingdom. This situation was beneficial to the Granas, who obtained permission to pay to replace the chechia with a white cap (kbîbes) and the wearing of a sefseri specific for their women, as a way to distinguish themselves from the Twansa who still had to wear the black cap. However, this concession contradicted with a relative hardening of the authorities during the first decades of the century, as reported by the doctor of the bey, Louis Franck, or the consul of the United States Mordecai Manuel Noah.\n\nOn the socio-economic level, the Jewish population was very heterogeneous. In the country ports, Jewish merchants of European origin control, along with Christians, the exchange of goods with foreign countries and dominated in more than half of trading houses operating in the country. Besides this wealthy class of traders and bankers, mainly Livornese, there was a middle class consisting of merchants and craftsmen.\nThese Jews played an important role in the retail trade, especially in the capital, where they were established in two souks of the medina: one specializing in colonial goods, hardware and articles from Paris and one specializing in draperies and English and French silk. Many were also engaging in artisanal activities, such as goldsmith, on which they had a monopoly, and also manufacture of clothes and footwear. They also served as lenders for peasants and artisans. In the rural areas of Nabeul, Gabes and Djerba, Jews were occupied in winemaking, growing date palms or fruit trees and stock raising.\n\nThere was also a poor class of Jews which were unable to survive without the charity organized by their community. Another group, the Bahusim (baḥuṣim, Hebrew for \"outsiders\") were semi-nomadic Jews in western Tunisia and eastern Algeria who led a tribal existence, like that of the Bedouin, and made their living from agriculture, peddling, and smithing. Jewish tribes of the region of Wargha, Kef Governorate, were Karaites and they have been nomad warriors. Their descendants, also named \"Bahusim\", remained in the eastern part of Algeria up to modern times.\n\nThe inclusion of Jews in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen on September 27, 1791, and the Napoleonic decrees of 1808 aroused a certain sympathy for France among the Jews of Tunisia who were all subjects of the Bey. Thus, in 1809, the Spanish authorities reported that \"the Jews are the most relentless partisans of Napoleon\". It was even reported that some Jews, including the Granas, wore at that time a tricolor cockade, an act severely repressed by Hammuda ibn Ali, which refuses any attempt by France to take under its protection its Jewish subjects originating from the newly conquered by Napoleon Tuscany. The Article 2 of the Treaty of July 10, 1822, signed with the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, fixes the duration of the stay of the Granas in Tunisia at two years; they also passed under the sovereignty of the bey and were granted the same status as the Twansa.\n\nAt the same time, while Tunisia was gradually opening up to European influences and also undergoing its pressure, the sovereign Ahmed Bey the First inaugurated a policy of reforms. By virtue of an act correcting the Tunisian-Tuscan Treaty of 1822, signed on November 2, 1846, the Granas established in Tunisia after the treaty or those who came to settle there, obtained the right to retain their status as Tuscans without any time limit, which is not the case with the Granas who arrived before 1822. This provision encouraged many Granas of Italian origin to emigrate to Tunisia, where they constituted a foreign minority – 90 persons in 1848, reinforced by a few French and British Jews the protection of the Consul of Tuscany and settled in the Franc district of Tunis unlike the former Granas settled in the Hara; Those who arrived after the Italian unification also benefited from the application of this provision.\n\nPolitical action is therefore seen as a means of putting an end to the exceptional status of Jews, constituting \"a real break in the mental universe of Jewish communities, a rupture which breaks the old world of submission to the order of things\". In 1853, the qaid of the Tunisian community, Nessim Samama, obtains the abolition of the chores to which his co-religionists were hitherto constrained.\n\nNevertheless, the Jews still had to pay the jizya and exceptional taxes claimed by the bey according to the needs and were also subject to discrimination. Jews had restricted dress code, according to which they were obliged to wear a black chechia (and not red, like the Muslims), a black or dark blue turban (and not white) and black shoes and not of bright color. They could not live outside their assigned neighborhoods and could not access real estate. Finally, when they were victims of vexations or violence, they did not receive reparation for the harm they have suffered.\n\nYet the relationship between Jews and Arabs changed dramatically from the middle of the century, due to the emergence of European colonial powers in Tunisia, and in France in particular. Indeed, they relied on the presence of Jews to promote their economic and commercial interests: the situation of these, often treated in an unfair way by the Tunisian courts, was used as a pretext for pressures on the bey. The Sfez affair in 1857 was an illustration of this new context and an opportunity for France and the United Kingdom to intervene on behalf of the defense of human rights and the struggle against absolutism and fanaticism in order to promote their interests.\n\nBatou Sfez was a Jewish coachman at the service of the qaid of his community, Nessim Samama. Following a traffic incident and an altercation with a Muslim, he was accused by Muslim of having insulted Islam; witnesses subsequently confirmed before a notary that they witnessed the scene. He was charged and convicted, according to Maliki law and despite his protestations, was sentenced by the Charaa court to a death penalty for blasphemy and beheaded with a saber sword on June 24, 1857. The sovereign Mohammed Bey sought by this gesture to appease the rancor born of the execution of a Muslim accused of having killed a Jew and to prove that his justice treats his subjects fairly. Nevertheless, the severity of the punishment aroused great emotion in the Jewish community and among the consuls of France and the United Kingdom, Léon Roches and Richard Wood.\nThey then took advantage of it to exert pressure on the sovereign to embark on the path of liberal reforms similar to those promulgated in the Ottoman Empire in 1839. Moreover, the historian Ahmad ibn Abi Diyaf refers to the Tunisian Jews as \"brothers in the homeland\" (Ikhwanoun fil watan), although he accuses some of them of exaggerating to seek the protection of foreign consuls.\n\nDuring the long reign of Ahmed I Bey, the Jews enjoyed prosperity. His successor, Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn, inaugurated his reign in 1855 by abolishing the drudgery imposed upon the Jews; the qaid Joseph Scemama, with whom the bey was on very intimate terms, probably used his influence in behalf of his coreligionists. That year, however Mohammed Bey had a Jew named Batto Sfez executed for blasphemy. This execution aroused both Jews and Christians, and a deputation was sent to Napoleon III, asking him to intervene on their behalf. After two years of diplomatic negotiations a man-of-war was sent to enforce the demands of the French government. Mohammed Bey yielded, and issued a constitution, according to which all Tunisians, without distinction of creed, were to enjoy equal rights. The following articles of this constitution were of special interest to the Jews:\n(§ 4) \"\"No manner of duress will be imposed upon our Jewish subjects forcing them to change their faith, and they will not be hindered in the free observance of their religious rites. Their synagogues will be respected, and protected from insult.\"\"\n\n(§ 6) \"\"When a criminal court is to pronounce the penalty incurred by a Jew, Jewish assessors shall be attached to the said court.\"\"\nThe constitution was abrogated in 1864 in consequence of a revolution, which entailed great suffering on several Jewish communities, especially on that of Sfax; but the constant fear of foreign interference rendered the government very circumspect in its treatment of the Jews.\n\nThe Jews of Tunisia felt much safer under the French protectorate. Contact with the French colonizers of Tunisia and the official presence of the French facilitated the assimilation of the Jews of Tunisia to French culture and their emancipation. Relying on the French revolutionary promise of \"Liberté, égalité, fraternité\", the Jews hoped for a better life and were very receptive to the new French influences, though they had a Christian European source. For the generation born under the protectorate, the French language replaced Judeo-Arabic as the mother tongue of the Jews of French Tunisia. Additionally, more Jewish children began attending state schools throughout the country, which slowly lead to the diffusion of French culture and lifestyle within the Jewish community.\n\nFollowing the armistice in June 1940, the French Protectorate of Tunisia became part of Vichy France, the new French state ruled by collaborationist Marshal Philippe Pétain during France's occupation by Nazi Germany in World War II. Under the rule of Pétain's collaborationist regime, the Jews of Vichy France and Vichy Tunisia were subjected to the two antisemitic \"Statut des Juifs\" (Jewish Statutes of October 3, 1940 and June 2, 1941), like the Jews in mainland France. Thus, discriminatory legislation defined the Jews, restricted them in the public service, in educational institutions and journalism, and in liberal professions (numerus clausus), counted them (Jewish census), and forced them to register their property to be subsequently aryanized. Consequently, Jews found themselves in their prior inferior status of \"natives\" and were impoverished. In August 1941, Xavier Vallat, head of the Office for Jewish Affairs (\"Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives\"), came from Metropolitan France to check the matter of the Jewish question. According to an article on the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) website \"The history of the Holocaust in France's three North African territories (the three departments, 91, 92, and 93, in French Algeria, the two French protectorates of Morocco and Tunisia) is intrinsically tied to France's fate during this period.\" Holocaust scholar Martin Gilbert specified that the persecution of the Jews of French North Africa was an integral part of the Holocaust in France. French Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia in European territories in North Africa were considered part of Europe, as per a French and German document relevant to the Final Solution of the Jewish question.\nThe Jews of Vichy-French North Africa were relatively fortunate because their distance from Nazi concentration camps in Central and Eastern Europe permitted them to avoid the fate of their coreligionists in Metropolitan France. Immediately after the Allied landings in Vichy-Algeria and Vichy-Morocco, the Germans occupied Vichy Tunisia. On November 23, 1942, the Germans arrested Moises Burgel, the president of the Tunis Jewish community, and several other prominent Jews. The Jews of Vichy Tunisia were spared the mass deportations and mass murder that happened in Europe.\nWhen the Nazis invaded Vichy Tunisia, the country was home to some 100,000 Jews. According to Yad Vashem, the Nazis imposed antisemitic policies including forcing Jews to wear the yellow badge (Star of David), fines, and confiscation of property. More than 5,000 Jews were sent to forced labor camps, where 265 are known to have died. An additional 160 Jews of Tunisia living in France were sent to extermination camps in continental Europe.\n\nKhaled Abdelwahhab, a Muslim Arab of Vichy Tunisia, \"the Arab Schindler,\" was the first Arab nominated for the Israeli Righteous Among the Nations award.\n\nAfter the Tunisian Revolution, Ennahda became the leading political force in the country, elected as the largest party in the transitional government. The party's leader, Rashid Al-Ghannushi, sent a delegation to the Jews in Djerba, assuring them that they have nothing to worry about in a democratic Tunisia, where the Islamists would play a larger role. He even sent gifts to the Jewish nursing homes in Tunis. In November 2012, the community asked for the army's protection when a policeman was arrested after plotting to kidnap a young Jew for a ransom.\n\nIn 2011, the Israeli cabinet announced that it had allocated funding to help Tunisian Jews move to Israel due to growing manifestations of anti-Jewish and the difficult economic situation.\n\nIn January 2014, the Ennahda-led government voluntarily stepped aside and a transitional government, appointed to rule during the drafting of the new constitution until democratic elections would be held later in the year, took office. The new secular constitution for the first time explicitly protected not only freedom of religion, but freedom of conscience (freedom to become atheist, leave or change religions), and explicitly protected minorities such as Jews from official or unofficial discrimination. The new Tunisian constitution is the first of its kind in the Maghreb and the Arab world in embracing both Arabism and liberal secularism, and is seen as a model for other countries to adopt. The democratically elected constitutional committee, dominated by Ennahda, also rejected terms which would have forbidden relations with Israel.\n\nThe Jewish community in Tunis operates three primary schools, two secondary schools and a yeshiva. The Jewish community in Djerba operates one kindergarten, two primary schools, two secondary schools and a yeshiva. There is also a Jewish primary school and synagogue in the coastal city of Zarzis. The Jewish community also has two homes for the aged. Tunisia's first Jewish museum opened in 2012. In 2015, Tunis’ last kosher restaurant closed due to security concerns.\n\nThe most famous synagogue in Tunisia is the El Ghriba synagogue in the village of Hara Sghira on Djerba. The current building was constructed in late 19th or early 20th century, but the site is believed to have had a synagogue on it for the past 1,900 years. Tunisian Jews have for centuries made an annual pilgrimage to the synagogue on Lag Ba'Omer. On April 11, 2002, a truck full of explosives was detonated close to the synagogue, killing 21 people (of whom 14 were German tourists and 2 Frenchmen), and wounding over 30, in the Ghriba Synagogue Attack. Al Qaeda claimed responsibility. Hayyim Madar was the chief rabbi until his death on December 3, 2004. Memorial services were held at the Beit Mordekhai Synagogue in La Goulette, Tunis, and the El Ghriba synagogue on the island of Djerba.\n\n\n\n"}

He is regarded as one of the finest comedians of the Pakistani film industry. He performed in over 300 films in his career spanning over 4 decades.\n\nHis birth name was Mohammad Saeed Khan and he was born in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan. His family moved to Peshawar, Pakistan when he was very young. He took a keen interest in bodybuilding and physical exercises as a teenager. He moved to Lahore at a young age and earned his livelihood by painting billboards for the Pakistani film industry. Once, when the shooting of a film was taking place, an actor for the film's jolly character role was needed. The film director asked Mohammad Saeed Khan to play the part which he did. All those present during the shooting were amused by his acting style and he became an actor through sheer luck. Rangeela made his professional cinematic debut in a 1958 Punjabi film \"Jatti\", directed by \"M. J. Rana\". He started playing humorous roles in movies and, to everybody's surprise, became highly popular. In 1969, he formed 'Rangeela Productions' to produce his own movies. He not only produced films but also directed his productions, sang songs, and wrote some scripts as well. His movies, to the surprise of many film industry stalwarts, attracted a large number of viewers. The film \"Diya Aur Toofan\", released on 9 May 1969, was Rangeela's directional debut. He directed numerous movies under the banner of Rangeela Productions. His acting was showcased in the film \"Rangeela\" (1970), in which he played the title role. His third consecutive hit film was \"Dil Aur Dunya\" (1971), starring Habib, Aasia and Rangeela. He brought to the film \"Dil Aur Dunya\", a sobering sense of a director's prowess which is the opposite to his celluloid persona.\n\nWhen Rangeela produced film \"Dia Aur Toofan\", he sang a song \"Gaa mere manwa gata ja re, janaa hai hamka duur\". People of the film industry were taken aback to know Rangeela was producing a film. The film attracted a large number of movie-goers. His song also became very popular.\n\nHis daughter Farah Deeba is a politician while his sons Kamran and Jahanzaib acted in some movies.\n\nRangeela died on 24 May 2005 at the age of 68. Rangeela was a dominant actor in Pakistani cinema for over forty years. He was married three times and had six daughters and six sons. His daughter is a CPA accountant in America and the other daughter was a member of parliament in Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was the follow-up release to their previous single, \"Dreamer\", which had been a big number-one hit in the UK. The song peaked at number-one in Italy, and on the Eurochart Hot 100, it reached number 12. In the UK, the single had its release on 15 June 1996, a whole year after the success of \"Dreamer\". It went straight in at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart, where it spent seven weeks in the Top 10 and a 14 weeks in the Top 100. (5-6-7-8-9-8-9-12-13-24-29-35-41-71) It ended the year in the United Kingdom as the 34th biggest selling single of the year. \n\nThe single was a turning point for Livin' Joy, ushering in a new vocalist after the group failed to reach a deal with Janice Robinson, the original vocalist on \"Dreamer\". Tameka Starr was to front the group from this point on. The frantic synths and beats of the song are sent in with Tameka's powerful vocals and she delivered an uplifting message over the clunking energetic beat. One of self-assurance, self belief in order to succeed and achieve.\n\nLarry Flick from \"Billboard\" commented that the new singer of the group \"has the pipes to make this happy-house anthem work\". He noted that the song \"has a lot of pep and radio-friendly energy\". \"Music & Media\" described the track as a \"bouncy number ready for embrace\", adding, \"The ingredients: a pounding beat, assured female vocals (Tameka Star) and a strong chorus. Radio should take notice.\" Pop Rescue noted it as \"the motivational poster of 90s dance music\". They added that Starr \"makes light work of the lyrics with her powerful vocals.\" Dave Fawbert from \"ShortList\" noted the song as \"one of those brilliant ‘90s follow-ups-to-a-hit-that-is-basically-the-same-but-not-quite-as-good-but-that-basically-means-it’s-still-brilliant. Coming after ‘Dreamer’, it fulfilled its mission perfectly.\"\n\nSinger Tameka Starr herself changed up the way Livin' Joy functioned as a group. Previously Janice Robinson was the soulful sultry powerhouse vocalist whose strengths also included songwriting (she wrote \"Dreamer\"). But Starr a prolific song writer herself, took it a step further and added choreography to her performances. Like all the previous pan-European dance acts before Livin' Joy, they finally had a face for the band that could deliver an all round performance. However Livin' Joy never managed the same level of success from their first two singles, with their next few releases achieving lower chart positions. Tameka Starr is still part of the entertainment industry today (under the name of Tameko Star) and has her own Entertainment agency in Atlanta Georgia, U.S.A.\n"}

Specifically, in May 1998, the mining company intended to fill Sea Tac's third runway; therefore, they sought for a shoreline exemption in order to fix their broken pier and loading facility located on a land owned by the State of Washington. Moreover, they requested a permit that would allow them to mine 7.5 million tons of gravel per year. Upon learning the extent of Glacier's expansion and driven by the need to protect the island's habitats and wildlife, Sharon Nelson and other homeowners and islanders formed Protect Our Islands (POI) (later named Preserve Our Islands) in opposition of the mine expansion.\n\nPOI had convinced the Washington State Department of Ecology to send biologists to study Glacier's proposed mining area, which was located above Maury Island's main water supply. They found high levels of arsenic and lead in the soil, elements that could contaminate the island's aquifer, a permeable, underground layer of water-bed rock that acts as a reservoir for groundwater. This contamination can lead to development disabilities in humans who drink the water. Despite Glacier's proposal of building a 30-feet high, 150-feet wide, and 2,100-feet long sealed berm that would isolate the soil and prevent any contamination, POI and other opponents were still not reassured of the safety of the island's water supply.\n\nInitially, POI and other opponents of the mine were on the losing end as the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Glacier, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (U.S.A.C.E.) approved Glacier's permit, and the Washington State Supreme Court denied to hear POI's case against Glacier. Eventually, things were looking up for the opposition. First, Doug Sutherland, a supporter of the mine expansion, lost the position of Commissioner of Public Lands to Peter J. Goldmark, an opponent of the mine expansion. Second, a statewide effort to restore Puget Sound was initiated by Governor Chris Gregoire. Third, with the support of the Backbone Campaign, POI organized a protest at the Glacier mine area with more than 500 protesters; this garnered media attention and gave this issue greater visibility. Fourth, in 2009, US District Judge Ricardo Martinez declared that construction on the loading facility can no longer continue until the U.S.A.C.E. thoroughly assesses the environmental implications of Glacier's project.\n\nIn the end, Glacier Northwest ended the mine expansion and the site was turned into the 235-acre King County Marine Park, after it was purchased by King County on January 8, 2011.\n"}

On this basis, the whole island became known as \"Kittim\" in Hebrew, including the Hebrew Bible. However the name seems to have been employed with some flexibility in Hebrew literature. It was often applied to all the Aegean islands and even to \"the W[est] in general, but esp[ecially] the seafaring W[est]\". Flavius Josephus (c. 100 AD) records in his Antiquities of the Jews that\n\nThe expression \"isles of Kittim\", found in the Book of Jeremiah 2:10 and Ezekiel 27:6, indicates that, some centuries prior to Josephus, this designation had already become a general descriptor for the Mediterranean islands. Sometimes this designation was further extended to apply to Romans, Macedonians or Seleucid Greeks. The Septuagint translates the occurrence of \"Kittim\" in the Book of Daniel 11:30 as ῥωμαῖοι (\"Romans\"). 1 Maccabees 1:1 states that \"Alexander the Great the Macedonian\" had come from the \"land of Kittim\". In the \"War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness\" from the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Kittim are referred to as being \"of Asshur\". Eleazar Sukenik argued that this reference to Asshur should be understood to refer to the Seleucid Empire which controlled the territory of the former Assyrian Empire at that time, but his son Yigael Yadin interpreted this phrase as a veiled reference to the Romans. \n\nSome authors have speculated that it comes from an Akkadian word meaning \"invaders\". Others (following Max Müller) have identified Kittim with the land of Hatti (Khatti), as the Hittite Empire was known.\n\nKittim (Hebrew: כִּתִּים, alternately transliterated as Chittim or Cethim) in the genealogy of Genesis 10 in the Hebrew Bible, is the son of Javan, the grandson of Japheth, and Noah's great-grandson. \n\nThe mediaeval rabbinic compilation \"Yosippon\" contains a detailed account of the Kittim. As the peoples spread out, it says, the Kittim camped in Campania and built a city called \"Posomanga\", while descendants of Tubal camped in neighboring Tuscany and built \"Sabino\", with the Tiber river as their frontier. However, they soon went to war following the rape of the Sabines by the Kittim, who are correlated to the Romans. This war was ended when the Kittim showed the descendants of Tubal their mutual progeny. They then built cities called Porto, Albano, and Aresah. Later, their territory is occupied by Agnias, King of Carthage, but the Kittim end up appointing Zepho, son of Eliphaz and grandson of Esau, as their king, with the title Janus Saturnus. The first king of Rome, Romulus, is made in this account to be a distant successor of this line. A shorter, more garbled version of this story is also found in the later \"Sefer haYashar.\"\n\n"}

Platt\n\nThomas Collier Platt (July 15, 1833 – March 6, 1910) was a two-term member of the U.S. House of Representatives (1873–1877) and a three-term U.S. Senator from New York in 1881 and 1897 to 1909. He is best known as the \"political boss\" of the Republican Party in New York State in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Upon his death, the \"New York Times\" stated that \"no man ever exercised less influence in the Senate or the House of Representatives than he,\" but \"no man ever exercised more power as a political leader.\" He considered himself the \"political godfather\" of many Republican governors of the state, including Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nPlatt played a key role in the creation of the City of Greater New York, which incorporated together the boroughs of New York (Manhattan), Kings (Brooklyn), Queens, Richmond (Staten Island) and Bronx counties.\n\nPlatt was born to William Platt, a lawyer, and Lesbia Hinchman, in Owego, Tioga County, New York on July 15, 1833. State Senator Nehemiah Platt (1797–1851) was William Platt's brother.\n\nWilliam Platt, a successful attorney and strict Presbyterian, encouraged his son to enter the ministry. Accordingly, the young Platt was prepared for college at the Owego Academy and attended Yale College (1850–1852), where he studied theology but failed to earn a degree owing to ill health which forced his withdrawal. \n\nAfter leaving Yale in 1852, he entered into a variety of employments. He started out as a druggist, a business in which he was engaged for two decades; was briefly an editor of a small newspaper; served as president of the Tioga National Bank; and was interested in the lumbering business in Michigan. He also acted as President of the Southern Central and other railways.\n\nIn 1852, he married his cousin Ellen Lucy Barstow with whom he had three sons: Edward T. Platt, Frank H. Platt, and Henry B. Platt.\n\nPlatt became secretary and a director of the United States Express Co. in 1879 and was elected president of the company in 1880. He was a president of the Board of Quarantine Commissioners of New York from 1880 to 1888 and was President of the Tennessee Coal & Iron Company for several years.\n\nPlatt's political involvement began at the Republican Party's inception; he made his first appearance in politics in 1856 in the campaign of the party's first presidential candidate, John C. Fremont. Running as a Republican, he was elected clerk of Tioga County, serving from 1859 to 1861. He was elected as a Republican to the Forty-third United States Congress and the Forty-fourth United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1873 to March 3, 1877. His influence on statewide politics began on his return from Congress in 1877, when he aligned with the \"Stalwart\" faction led by US Senator Roscoe Conkling at the party's state convention, and against the \"Half-Breed\" faction loyal to President Rutherford B. Hayes.\n\nIn January 1881 he was elected with the support of the Stalwart faction to represent New York in the United States Senate. He became a member of the Forty-seventh Congress and the chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills. However, he served only from March 4 to May 16, 1881, when he and Conkling resigned because of a disagreement with President James Garfield over federal appointments in New York. (Platt resigned at Conkling's insistence, earning him the nickname of \"Me Too\" Platt.) The immediate occasion of their resignation was Garfield's appointment of Half-Breed faction leader William H. Robertson as Collector of the Port of New York. Soon afterward, however, Garfield's assassination by Charles J. Guiteau, a self-proclaimed Stalwart who claimed friendships with Platt and Conkling, was the finishing blow for their faction. Platt and Conkling ran in the special election to fill the vacancies created by their own resignations but lost. Eschewing elective office, Platt then devoted his attention to mending fences and rebuilding the machine, which he then ran after 1887 as an \"easy boss.\"\n\nSixteen years after Platt's resignation, he was elected to the a second time a U.S. Senator from New York in January 1897 and was re-elected in January 1903. This time, he served from March 4, 1897, to March 3, 1909. He was Chairman of the Committee on Transportation Routes to the Seaboard (in the 55th Congress). He was on the Committee on Printing (in the 56th through 60th Congresses), the Committee on Cuban Relations (in the 59th Congress) and the Committee on Interoceanic Canals (in the 59th Congress). He also served on the Republican National Committee.\n\nOn January 21, 1897, Platt's photograph appeared in the \"New York Tribune\" as \"the first halftone reproduction to appear in a mass circulation daily paper,\" according to Time-Life's \"Photojournalism\".\n\nTo increase his power as a political boss, Platt steered passage of the Greater New York bill in 1898. The bill incorporated the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island into the city, thereby creating New York City as it exists today.\n\nPlatt reluctantly supported Theodore Roosevelt's candidacy for Governor of New York in 1898 in the immediate aftermath of Roosevelt's fame leading the Rough Riders in the Spanish–American War earlier that year. Once elected, Governor Roosevelt was independently minded and crusaded against machines and corruption. In response, Platt sought a way to \"shelve\" Roosevelt so that a more compliant governor could be installed in his place. President William McKinley's original vice president had died in office, leaving a place on the ticket to fill before the 1900 election. At the 1900 Republican National Convention, Platt and President McKinley's political ally Mark Hanna proposed to get Roosevelt out of Platt's way in New York by nominating him for vice president. Roosevelt was chosen by acclamation, played a major part in McKinley re-election, and became president in September 1901 after McKinley was assassinated in office.\n\nPlatt's control over the Republican Party in New York State effectively ended in 1902. Benjamin Barker Odell Jr., Roosevelt's successor as governor, had not only acted independently of Platt but also, by 1902, insisted on taking over from Platt as leader of the party. After Platt tried but failed to block Odell's renomination as governor and Odell was re-elected, the era of a separate \"boss\" was over.\n\nPlatt was a member of the New York Society of Colonial Wars.\n\nTwo years after his first wife died in 1901, he married Lillian Janeway, whom the \"New York Times\" described as \"young enough in appearance to pass for his daughter.\" Their legal separation was announced in 1906, with Platt agreeing to pay his estranged wife $75,000 in exchange for her dropping all financial claims upon him and dismissing a suit for divorce which had been previously filed.\n\nDuring his final years Platt suffered from a palsy of his legs which confined him to a wheelchair for a majority of the time. He retired from the Senate in 1909 and was stricken by what was diagnosed as an acute attack of Bright's disease on May 28, 1909, a case so severe that his doctor publicly predicted his patient's imminent demise. Platt recovered, however, convalescing until late in January 1910, when he was deemed well enough to return home to his Manhattan apartment.\n\nSeemingly restored to heath, Platt was suddenly stricken by a second attack of kidney disease at about 1 pm in the afternoon of March 6, 1910. His personal physician was called, but it was immediately deemed apparent that there would be no recovery in this second life-threatening incident. Platt died in his own bed at about 4 pm on that same day.\n\nOn March 7, Republican Governor Charles Evans Hughes ordered flags of state buildings to be flown at half-staff in commemoration of the death of the former United States Senator, an action setting a precedent in New York of state government honoring such a former federal elected official in that manner.\n\nPlatt's body was interred in Evergreen Cemetery, Owego, New York. At the time of his death, he remained married to Lillian, but she received nothing in his will.\n\nHis namesake great-grandson was the lawyer and judge Thomas Collier Platt Jr.\n\n"}

The show featured the music quiz 'Pop the Question' and the Tuesday chart rundown as the new weekly chart was published on Tuesdays instead of Sundays at this time.\n\nIn 1976, station bosses fell out with Walker over the music he played and about how it was seen not to fit the station's daytime music line-up. He was also told off for criticising The Bay City Rollers – then at the height of their popularity – on air, describing them as \"musical garbage\". As a result, he left Radio 1 and moved to the U.S. where he stayed for five years. During his time in the states Walker worked for radio stations KSAN in San Francisco, WHFS (historic) in Bethesda, Maryland and also recorded some shows for Radio Luxembourg. He was also involved in other enterprises.\n\nWalker returned to the UK in the early 1980s and in 1982 presented Radio West's evening show \"The Modern World\". In September 1983 he joined Wiltshire Radio presenting the 11am2pm slot. He was subsequently heard on GWR, which was formed out of the merger of Radio West and Wiltshire Radio.\n\nOn 17 January 1987, Walker re-joined Radio 1, presenting the Saturday afternoon show \"The Stereo Sequence\" (so named owing to the fact that until then-recently, Radios 1 and 2 shared the same FM wavelength, with much of Radio 1's output transmitted on medium wave only at times when Radio 2 were in occupation of the FM frequency). The show was later renamed \"The Saturday Sequence\" once Radio 1 FM become more mainstream in the late 1980s; the shows ran from 2pm to 7:30pm, before Roger Scott took over in mid-1988. In July 1988, he was briefly heard on Richard Branson's syndicated service \"The Superstation\" which provided overnight programming to some ILR stations.\n\nIn October 1988, Walker was one of the original presenters on the new BBC local station in London BBC GLR, in a lineup which included Nick Abbot, Emma Freud, Tommy Vance and Dave Pearce and was run by future Radio 1 controller Matthew Bannister. Walker presented the weekday slot from noon to 3pm. Then after a few months, he took over from Emma Freud from 10am to 1pm.\n\nIn 1990 Walker joined the new BBC Radio 5, presenting \"This Family Business\" three days a week, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 11am to 12.30pm. As a result, he took over the weekday show on BBC GLR from 7 to 9pm, where he remained until later that year, when he was dismissed from the station by Matthew Bannister after making the comment that people would be \"dancing in the streets\" about the resignation of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister.\n\nFollowing his dismissal from BBC GLR he took the BBC Radio 5 show five days a week and his show was expanded to 9:30am to noon Mondays to Fridays and was rebranded as \"The AM Alternative\". He remained with Radio 5 until March 1994 when the station re-launched as BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\nIn September 1991, as well as presenting for Radio 5, Walker returned to Radio 1, taking over from Richard Skinner on \"The Saturday Sequence\" (renamed from its original incarnation as \"The Stereo Sequence\", as that appellation was now deemed irrelevant by the fact that both Radios 1 and 2 had by then long had their own separate FM frequencies) every Saturday from 3 to 7pm. He went out from 3 to 6pm in March 1992.\n\nHe remained until October 1993, moving to Saturday the 711pm slot, before moving back to Saturday afternoons in November 1994 from 2 to 5pm, where he remained until he left Radio 1 for good in October 1995.\n\nIn early 1996, Walker was on London's Talk Station LBC, presenting the weekend programme from 6 to 10am. In addition, he was heard on Classic Gold stations around the UK on Saturday from noon to 2pm.\n\nIn 1997, in addition to his Classic Gold shows, Walker was on BBC Radio 2 presenting documentaries and filling in for presenters.\n\nIn April 1998, Walker was offered his own weekly show on Radio 2, Saturday from 3:30 to 5:30pm, then six months later, as well as Saturday afternoons, Walker took over from John Dunn from 5 to 7pm Monday to Thursday. Des Lynam presented Friday's edition.\n\nIn early 1999, Walker came off his show having been the subject of a tabloid exposé over his cocaine problem. BBC Radio 2 bosses gave Walker back his drivetime show after he was fined £2,000 for possession of cocaine. He was suspended by the BBC when the drug allegations were published in the \"News of the World\" in April 1999. Bosses later reinstated him after the court case. During Walker's absence Richard Allinson filled in for him on Drivetime while Billy Bragg took over Saturday afternoon. Walker returned to his Drivetime show, now presenting from Monday to Friday, towards the end of 1999. The first record he played on his return was \"Alright Guy\" by Todd Snider, some of the lyrics of which seemed appropriate in the context of his enforced absence. Janice Long then took over Saturday afternoons.\n\nWalker told listeners in June 2003 that he was suffering from cancer. He ended his show by stating he was beginning treatment and would be taking time off to recover, after which he played \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" by Simon & Garfunkel. Stuart Maconie filled in for him, then on Thursday 24 July 2003, the BBC announced that Noel Edmonds would join Radio 2, to present \"Drivetime\" for eight weeks. Edmonds took over from Monday 4 August, until Friday 3 October. Walker's recovery continued, but there was to be no return after Edmonds. Stuart Maconie continued as stand-in, and at the beginning of Monday 6 October's Drivetime show, he played Bruce Springsteen's \"Born to Run\" for Walker, remarked that he was doing well, and that he was due to return at the end of the year.\n\nOn 12 February 2004, Radio 2 announced Walker would return on 1 March. This was followed by his own message, \"Well, it's taken a lot longer than I originally thought, but I reckon I'm fit enough now to come back to the Drive Time show on Monday 1 March. I'd like to thank Jim Moir and Lesley Douglas for keeping the door open for me all this time, and also to Stuart Maconie for doing such a great job on the show while I've been away. And a huge thank you to Radio 2 listeners for all their wonderful support since I left the show in June 2003. I've been very lucky to have had so many good wishes and kindness sent in my direction, it helped enormously with my recovery – thank you so much. It will be great for us to be re-united again from 1 March.\"\n\nWalker returned on 1 March, with his first record being Eric Clapton's \"Hello Old Friend\". Walker and Clapton were born on the same day and Walker later presented a Radio 2 show to celebrate the fact that they were both turning 60.\n\nJohnnie Walker was made an MBE in the New Year Honours 2006.\n\nIn February 2006 it was announced that Walker would step down as host of Radio 2 Drivetime to take over from Ed Stewart on Sunday afternoons and conduct interviews with musicians. His last Drivetime show was on 31 March, with Neil Diamond as a guest. The final song played by Walker on the show was \"Human Touch\" by Bruce Springsteen. From 23 April, Walker took over a show on Sundays from 5 to 7 pm. As well as his Sunday show, Walker also deputised for an unwell Brian Matthew on Radio 2's \"Sounds of the 60s\" from 2 September 2006, until the programme broadcast on 25 November 2006 when he too had to take time off the air for medical reasons. He returned to the programme on 6 January 2007 and continued to host the show until Matthew's return on 10 February. He also returned to his own Sunday show the following day.\n\nFrom 28 January 2007, his Sunday show was broadcast from 4:30 to 6:30pm. In addition, he also deputised for Terry Wogan on Radio 2's Breakfast show up until the end of 2009. His autobiography was published on 31 May 2007 – while the previous year another book, \"Johnnie Walker – Cruisin' The Formats\", put his radio work in the context of radio development over 40 years.\n\nFrom 9 August to 14 August 2007, Walker was one of several former pirate radio disc jockeys at BBC Essex's six-day revival of pirate radio that marked the 40th anniversary of the Marine Offences Act. He was also part of \"Pirate BBC Essex\" programmes broadcast over Easter 2009 to celebrate 45 years since Radio Caroline started.\n\nOn Saturday 7 February 2009 Walker started a new ten-week series called \"Pirate Johnnie Walker\" on BBC Radio 2. This show recreated the sounds of pirate radio from the 1960s, and had other Pirate DJs from the era as guests.\n\nFrom 5 April 2009 Walker started a new Sunday afternoon (35pm) show on Radio 2 called \"Sounds of the 70s\". This show is similar to the show previously presented by Steve Harley who broadcast his final show on Thursday 27 March 2008, but parts of the format are different and often features interviews with guest artistes.\n\nOn 30 March 2012 he launched his \"Alternative Johnnie Walker\" podcast which aimed to \"Open the door to an alternative view of the world featuring inspirational and radical thinkers dedicated to improving life on Planet Earth.\"\n\nIn January 2019 it was announced that Walker would step down from \"The Rock Show\" and \"Sound Of The 70s\" \"for a number of weeks\", to receive treatment for a heart condition. He returned to Radio 2 on 16 March.\n\nWalker has done voice-over work for television adverts. He has appeared on GMTV several times, and was an advisor to the film \"The Boat That Rocked\", released in April 2009.\nOn 29 June 2009, whilst covering for Terry Wogan on BBC Radio 2, Johnnie revealed that for many years he and another DJ, Chris Bull, had been responsible for playing the records between sets on the Pyramid stage at the Glastonbury Festival, an important role as it sets the mood for the next act. His wife, Tiggy, had suggested playing Oasis's \"Wonderwall\" before Bruce Springsteen's set two days earlier—an inspired choice that soon had the crowd singing along. From the crowd's reaction, Walker turned to Bull, saying \"How are we going to follow that?\".\n\nWalker and his wife Tiggy have both cared for each other through serious illness, and are patrons of Carers UK After having being diagnosed herself with breast cancer in 2013, in September 2015 Tiggy published the book \"Unplanned Journey\", a photographic journal charting her experience of cancer diagnosis and treatment. All royalties from the book are to be donated to Carers UK. Walker also compered the Concert At The Kings show in 2015.\n\nWalker admits to having led a turbulent life. He has two children from his first marriage to Frances Kum in 1971 which ended in a divorce in 2000. He married Tiggy Jarvis (born 26 December 1960) on 21 December 2002.\n\nWalker is a 2013 recipient of the BASCA Gold Badge Award.\n\nWalker's hobbies include photography, backgammon and travelling in a camper van. He is also known for his love of Harley Davidson motorcycles.\n\n"}

The sled is propelled by kicking (\"sparka\" or \"sparke\" in the Scandinavian languages) the ground by foot. There is a handlebar attached to the top of the chair back. \"Kicksled\" is a direct translation of the Finnish word \"potkukelkka\". Some other possible translations are \"kicker\" and \"chair-sled\".\n\nThe typical adult sized sled has runners about long, spaced apart. The steel runner blades are about wide. The handlebars are about above ground.\nThe kicksled is driven forward by the driver standing on one runner, kicking backwards on the ground with the other foot, hence the name. The flexibility of the runners allows the driver to steer the kicksled by twisting the handlebars. One can have a passenger or luggage on the chair seat. The kicksled can also be used as a dog sled.\n\nA kicksled is designed to be used on hard, slippery surfaces like ice or hardpacked snow. To kicksled in deeper, more powdery snow, extra-wide plastic snow runners are attached to the standard, thin runners of the sled. On very smooth, bare ice, the use of traction devices like spiked shoes or crampons improves kicking force. On level ground, one can easily reach a speed of to , and much faster on downhill section or with a strong tail wind.\n\nThe kicksled is in common use in Sweden, Norway and Finland, especially where roads are not sanded or salted. Stereotypically it is used by old women in the countryside.\n\nIt is also an excellent means of travelling over frozen lakes to go ice fishing or just to explore the lake. Kicksledding on lake ice shares many of the same features as tour skating.\n\nSome models also include a wheel kit allowing to transform the sled to a kind of walking aid for summer use. This type is especially popular amongst the elderly.\n\nThe first definite record of a kicksled was in a newspaper in northern Sweden around 1870. The kicksleds of that era had stiff wooden runners and were heavy. In 1909 the design of the modern kicksled with flexible metal runners was introduced by the Swedish factory Orsasparken, \nwhich quickly became standard in Sweden, Finland and Norway.\n\nIn the years 1890 to 1910 kicksled racing was a popular sport, especially in Sweden. Kicksled racing was a major event in the\nNordic Games, which were the ancestor of the Winter Olympics.\n\nAround 1990 kicksled racing was revived as a serious sport in Finland. There are races of up to long and the average speed is around . Often the kicksled races are held in conjunction with marathon speed skating races on natural ice; the kicksleds use the same ice track as the skaters.\n\nA light-weight racing kicksled model is mass-produced by the Finnish kicksled company ESLA. Another racing and sport purposed aluminium-alloy based ultralight kicksled - the Kickspark is produced by Kickbike Worldwide in Finland.\n\nIn Canada, the kick sled has been modified for dog sports. A bridle is attached to the kick sled, and a gangline to that, with one to three dogs pulling. This small sled is useful for the urban dog owner, as it is lighter and easier to transport than a full scale dog sled. Kick sled races are now being held, with teams racing at times comparable to skijorers.\n\nNorways's Geilo Ski Resort boasts an annual Kicksled World Championship every January.\n\n\n"}

It implemented the channel-based concurrency model of Newsqueak in a compiled, C-like language.\n\nAlef appeared in the first and second editions of Plan 9, but was abandoned during development of the third edition. Rob Pike later explained Alef's demise by pointing to its lack of automatic memory management, despite Pike's and other people's urging Winterbottom to add garbage collection to the language;\nalso, in a February 2000 slideshow, Pike noted: \"…although Alef was a fruitful language, it proved too difficult to maintain a variant language across multiple architectures, so we took what we learned from it and built the thread library for C.\"\n\nAlef was superseded by two programming environments. The Limbo programming language can be considered a direct successor of Alef and is the most commonly used language in the Inferno operating system. The Alef concurrency model was replicated in the third edition of Plan 9 in the form of the \"libthread\" library, which makes some of Alef's functionality available to C programs and allowed existing Alef programs (such as Acme) to be translated.\n\nThis example was taken from the Alef reference manual.

{"id": "1935238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935238", "title": "Tamborrada", "text": "Tamborrada\n\nTamborrada of Donostia (in Basque Donostiako Danborrada) is a celebratory drum festival held every year on January 20 in the city of San Sebastián, Spain. At midnight, in the Konstituzio Plaza in the \"Alde Zaharra/Parte Vieja\" (Old Town), the mayor raises the flag of San Sebastián. The festival lasts for 24 hours. Participants, dressed as cooks and soldiers, march in companies across the city. The celebration ends at midnight, when people congregate at the Konstituzio Plaza and the \ncity flag is simultaneously lowered at various locations.\n\nThe last Carlist War in Spain took place between the end of the 18th century and the Second Carlist War (Literal translation from Catalan/Spanish: The War of the Matiners or Madrugadores) (1846-1849) and the Third Carlist War (in Spanish: Tercera Guerra Carlista) (1872–1876). As a walled military stronghold, the city of San Sebastián was subject to heavy property damage due to military activity, sometimes with dire consequences. This was especially true during the Siege of San Sebastián (1813), in which international powers (Spain, France, Great Britain, and Portugal) were involved. The war caused between 7,000 and 50,000 casualties.\n\nThe festival is said to originate from the 1830s custom of locals using buckets and hardware from the water pump to mock the soldiers stationed in the city by aping their daily procession from the San Telmo headquarters to the Main Gate at the city walls (\"Puerta de Tierra\"). The comic procession in carnival mood may have developed into a youth music group, the Carnival of Donostia, which started on the 20th of January, followed by the Caldereros at the beginning of February.\n\nIn the early days, the procession also heralded the ox run event, held on the same day. At this stage, the members of the procession dressed in everyday clothes, as they had not adopted uniforms yet. The procession further developed when local tradesman Vicente \"Txiki\" Buenechea donated barrels to be used as drums. In 1881, unused military outfits were discovered in the San Telmo headquarters. These were donated to the council, which in turn gave them to the Union Artesana club (the oldest in existence) for use in the Tamborrada. By 1886, barrels were added to the formations in attendance. Other \"sociedades gastronómicas\" (\"gourmet clubs\") joined the Union Artesana in following years, thus expanding the festival attendance.\n\nAccording to an urban legend, a baker was fetching water from a fountain during a drought in San Sebastián in 1720. As he began to sing, local women around him started pounding on their water basins to accompany him. To his surprise, the water kept on flowing and they kept on drumming with glee. Soon a crowd gathered. As the legend has it, there has not been a drought ever since, nor has the music of the barrels ever stopped playing.\n\nThe event was cancelled in 1902 and was revived in 1906, but remained the same way even up to the years of Francisco Franco's dictatorship, which banned Carnival statewide, but maintained the two iconic festivals of the city, the Tamborrada and the Caldereros. To ensure the continuity of the city's traditions the first Children's Tamborrada was held in 1927, and has now become a permanent part of the festivities since 1961. From just only 3 in the 1920s, today there are over 125 clubs and organizations that have formations for the event.\n\nIn 1861, local musician Raimundo Sarriegui composed the occasion's iconic marches, including the \"March of San Sebastian\", which caught on and gained popularity. Other works of his include \"Erretreta\", \"Tatiago\", \"Diana\" and \"Iriyarena.\" Additional pieces have been added more recently. The traditional lyrics sung to the marches were composed by local writer Serafin Baroja.\n\nThe old city march, composed by José Juan Santesteban, was added to the official songlist in 2013, marking the bicentennial year since the historic siege of 1813. The Old March was played in the 1830s as part of the festivities during those times.\n\nAdults usually have dinner in \"sociedades gastronómicas\" (\"gourmet clubs\"), which provide elements of the procession, and traditionally admitted only males. Even the strictest ones now allow women on the \"Noche de la Tamborrada.\" They eat sophisticated meals, mostly composed of seafood (traditionally elver, now no longer served due to its exorbitant price) and drink the best wines.\n\nDepending on the time the company is marching, parade-goers take to the streets and are sometimes offered drinks between the musical performances. Nowadays, the Tamborrada is made up of mixed-sex companies for the most part, while proportions may vary a lot from one to the other. For \"Donostiarras,\" this is the most celebrated festival of the year. These drummer groups often have marching bands playing along with them.\n\nAfter hearing drums all night, children wake up with a version of the Tamborrada for children. They dress traditionally as soldiers from Napoleonic times and march around the city. Children from all the schools of San Sebastián march that day. They wear costumes that usually represent a particular country (such as England, Germany, or Romania). More recently, the parade has been pushed back to days before the festival proper; thus, the Children's Tamborrada is the first activity of the festival. 2020 marks the 59th anniversary of the Children's Tamborrada, which launched in 1961 to promote the cultural legacy of the festival to the younger generations. A repeat performance is held at noon on the festival day. Fifty-two contingents from schools in the city join the celebrations beating their snare drums while honoring the heroes of the defense of the city and its patron.\n\nEach of the contingents are formed by and sponsored by traditionally the txokos, and today by a variety of organizations sanctioned by the city council to form delegations for the festival. These also send liaisons to coordinate with a city council representative on the route of the march and on what district/s and/or borough/s of the city they will have to hold their festivities for the year.\n\nMost of these are of company size save for one - the Peña Anastasio association - with 400 men and women, the size of a small battalion, and split into 3 formations. It is also affiliated with the local football team in the area.\n\nEach for the formations are composed of:\n\n\nFormed in 1934, the Gaztelubide association's contingent serves as the official band for the opening and closing ceremonies. By 2015 they are joined by the Coro Easo in singing the San Sebastian March.\n\nGiven San Sebastián's status as one of the two cities chosen to be the European Capital of Culture for 2016, it is no surprise, however, that Wroclaw, Poland, the other ECC city, has begun celebrating the festival as well in 2015 - as the \"Wroclaw Tamborrada\". The 2016 event even had Polish Armed Forces bands in attendance. Just like in San Sebastián, children also take part in the event as well.\n\n"}

It is based on the homonymous novel by Gustave Flaubert (1862). Initially refused by Paris, Reyer's opera enjoyed its first performance at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels, on 10 February 1890, with sets designed by Pierre Devis and Armand Lynen. The Parisian premiere at the Palais Garnier took place on 16 May 1892 with costumes by Eugène Lacoste and sets by Eugène Carpezat (Acts I and V), Auguste Alfred Rubé and Philippe Chaperon (Act II), and Amable and Eugène Gardy (Act IV). \n\nThe American premiere was at the French Opera House in New Orleans on 25 January 1900 with Lina Pacary in the title role. It was first performed in New York at the 'old' Metropolitan Opera House on 20 March 1901, with Lucienne Bréval in the title role, Albert Saléza, Eustase Thomas-Salignac, Marcel Journet, Charles Gillibert, Eugène Dufriche, and Antonio Scotti with Luigi Mancinelli conducting.\n\nPortions of the opera were performed in 1906 in the ancient Roman Carthage amphitheatre during an event sponsored by the Carthage Institute, making it among the first pieces formally staged there since the structure was destroyed by the Vandals in AD 439. \n\nThis rarely nowadays performed opera received the last performance at the Paris Opera in 1943, and the most recent one in Marseilles on 27 September 2008, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Reyer's death.\n\n\nIn 1863, Modest Mussorgsky also started writing text and music for an opera based on Flaubert's novel, but he never managed to complete the work. Other versions were written by V. Fornari (1881), Niccolò Massa (1886), Eugeniusz Morawski-Dąbrowa, Josef Matthias Hauer (1930), Alfredo Cuscinà (1931), Veselin Stoyanov (1940) and Franco Casavola (1948). Contemporary French composer Philippe Fénélon's \"Salammbô\" was first performed at the Opéra Bastille in 1998.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1935302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935302", "title": "WWOZ", "text": "WWOZ\n\nWWOZ is a non-profit community-supported radio station in New Orleans, Louisiana broadcasting at 90.7 FM. The station specializes in music from or relating to the cultural heritage of New Orleans and the surrounding region of Louisiana.\n\nWWOZ programming is most heavily weighted toward contemporary jazz and rhythm & blues, with other programming including traditional jazz, blues, Cajun music, zydeco, old time and country music, bluegrass, Gospel, Celtic music and World music.\n\nAs the station is known for its support of local music, local musicians are often guests on programs and sometimes perform live over the air, especially for the station's twice-yearly membership drives. Musicians and singers such as Rob Cambre, Samirah Evans, Alan Fontenot, Bob French, Hazel the Delta Rambler, Sam Cammarata, Ernie K-Doe, Bobby Mitchell, Davis Rogan, Tom Saunders, John Sinclair, Don Vappie, Dr. Michael White and others have had their own shows on the station.\n\nWWOZ is also known for its location broadcasts of live music events, including the annual New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.\n\nIn 2018, WWOZ was honored with the Prestige Award for Station of the Year by the Louisiana Association of Broadcasters in recognition of its on-air programming, the large number of volunteer hosts, live music broadcasts, as well as its \"WWOZ in the Schools\" program.\n\nThe founders of WWOZ were brothers Walter and Jerry Brock, from Texas, who thought New Orleans needed a community radio station and began organizing it in the mid-1970s. Jerry is also the co-founder of the Louisiana Music Factory and a record producer engaged in the works of various local artists. The Nora Blatch Educational Foundation (named after radio pioneer Nora Blatch, wife of Lee De Forest) was established as a non-profit organization to hold the station license. The call letters WWOZ were chosen as a reference to The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, specifically the line, \"Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain,\" meaning that attention should be given to the program content rather than the personalities of the disc jockeys.\n\nThe station began broadcasting on December 4, 1980 from the tiny transmitter building in Bridge City, Louisiana beneath their shared rented broadcast tower. A few months later the broadcasts moved to the space the station had been using in a dilapidated two-room apartment upstairs from the music club \"Tipitina's\" at Napoleon Avenue and Tchoupitoulas Street in Uptown New Orleans.\n\nConditions at WWOZ in the early 1980s were spartan. The studio/office had no air-conditioning, and for a time just before moving out of the Tipitina's site, the only running water to the tiny bathroom was from a neighbor's garden hose run in through a window. Everyone who did a show volunteered hours of time on other tasks to keep the station going, from addressing envelopes to sweeping the floor. When artists performing live downstairs at Tipitina's gave their permission, their performances were broadcast via a microphone lowered through a hole in the floor. When permission to broadcast live performances downstairs could not be obtained, programming went to pre-recorded reel-to-reel tapes, as the music downstairs made it too loud in the studio to talk over the microphones and the vibrations made it impossible to use the station's turntables.\n\nIn 1985 WWOZ moved the studio to a building in Louis Armstrong Park in the Tremé neighborhood. With the station facing financial difficulties, in 1986 the license was transferred to the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Foundation (parent organization of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival) which helped subsidize the operation. The station later added an office in a small house across St. Philip Street from the studio.\n\nIn 1996, Better Than Ezra, an Alternative rock band from New Orleans, wrote a song titled \"WWOZ\", where they mention this radio station. WWOZ was also featured on the HBO series \"Treme\".\n\nWWOZ made the decision to go off the air at midnight on August 27, 2005 in anticipation of Hurricane Katrina to allow its programmers and staff to evacuate the city. It actually went off the air slightly earlier, just after 10pm. The last song played before signing off that night was \"What the Heck, Let’s Discotheque\" by Side Effect, spun by DJ Soul Sister. In the storm the WWOZ studio suffered minor damage but the Park's power system was wiped out and not a repair priority in the big picture, while the WWOZ staff, like the rest of the New Orleans population, was scattered to shelter in several states. But the station's transmitter atop the Tidewater Building on Canal Street in downtown New Orleans was found to be intact and serviceable, given a studio source. Within a week WWOZ initiated a webcast as \"WWOZ in Exile\" via Internet servers at WFMU in New Jersey. Many long term listeners from around the country donated tapes of WWOZ broadcasts from years gone by, some of which were rebroadcast in part or whole. On October 18, 2005 WWOZ resumed limited hours of broadcasting over the air in New Orleans, via studio space provided by Louisiana Public Broadcasting in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The station returned a physical studio to New Orleans in December 2005, using temporary office and studio space at the French Market office building, returning to its airwaves on 15 December.\n\nMuch of WWOZ's programming has long been based on the large personal record collections of the various programmers, many of which were lost in the disaster. For some time after the station returned to the air, one programmer did a series of shows entirely from CDs rescued from the debris in post-Katrina muck. \n\nAt first the French Quarter studio was expected to be a temporary arrangement for approximately a year. However agreements were made for WWOZ to use more space in the French Market office building for studio and office space, and WWOZ has remained at this location, with supplemental offices at the New Orleans Healing Center and in Kenner, Louisiana.\n\nPre-Katrina, thousands of hours of New Orleans music performances on tape via WWOZ were stored in a non-descript storage site. The floodwaters stopped at the storage container's loading dock and were not lost. The tapes were later shipped to the Library of Congress, which had previously named the WWOZ collection to its National Recording Registry. The Library agreed to store, catalog, and digitize the collection, a process which was expected to take many years to complete. By April 2016, the collection of over 2,000 recordings was made available to the public via walk-in listening in the Library's Recorded Sound Research Center in the Madison Building on Capitol Hill.\n\nWWOZ's on-air show hosts are all volunteers and receive no compensation for the music that they play on the station, primarily playing from their personal collections of music. Most of them are deeply involved in the New Orleans music community and many are musicians. The station does have a small staff of paid personnel who handle the day-to-day operations of the station.\n\n\n"}

He was a scion of the Anscarid and Unruoching dynasties, and was named after his maternal grandfather, Berengar I. He succeeded his father as Margrave of Ivrea around 923 (whence he is often known as Berengar of Ivrea), and after 940 led the aristocratic opposition to Kings Hugh and Lothair II. In 950 he succeeded the latter and had his son, Adalbert crowned as his co-ruler. In 952 he recognised the suzerainty of Otto I of Germany, but he later joined a revolt against him. In 960 he invaded the Papal States, and the next year his kingdom was conquered by Otto. Berengar remained at large until his surrender in 964. He died imprisoned in Germany two years later.\n\nBerengar was a son of Margrave Adalbert I of Ivrea and his wife Gisela of Friuli, daughter of the Unruoching king Berengar I of Italy. He succeeded his father as margrave about 923 and married Willa, daughter of the Bosonid margrave Boso of Tuscany and niece of King Hugh of Italy. The chronicler Liutprand of Cremona, raised at Berengar's court at Pavia, gives several particularly vivid accounts of her character.\n\nAbout 940 Berengar led a revolt of Italian nobles against the rule of his uncle. To evade an assault by Hugh's liensmen, he, forewarned by the king's young son Lothair, had to flee to the court of King Otto I of Germany. Otto avoided taking sides; nevertheless, in 945 Berengar was able to return to Italy with hired troops, welcomed by the local nobility. Hugh was defeated and retired to Arles, and he was nominally succeeded by Lothair. From the time of Berengar's successful uprising, all real power and patronage in the Kingdom of Italy was concentrated in his hands, with Hugh's son Lothair as titular king. Lothair's brief reign ended upon his early death in 950, presumably poisoned.\n\nBerengar then assumed the royal title with his son Adalbert as co-ruler. He attempted to legitimize his kingship by forcing Lothair's widow Adelaide, the respective daughter, daughter-in-law, and widow of the last three Italian kings, into marriage with Adalbert. However, the young woman fiercely refused, whereafter Berengar had her imprisoned at Garda Castle, allegedly mistreated by Berengar's wife Willa. With the help of Count Adalbert Atto of Canossa she managed to flee and entreated the protection of King Otto of Germany. Otto, himself a widower since 946, took the occasion to gain the Iron Crown of Lombardy: Adelaide's requests for intervention resulted in his 951 invasion of Italy. Berengar had to entrench himself at San Marino, while Otto received the homage of the Italian nobility, married Adelaide himself, and assumed the title of a \"King of the Lombards\". He afterwards returned to Germany, appointing his son-in-law Conrad the Red Italian regent at Pavia.\n\nBerengar by Conrad's agency appeared at the 952 Reichstag in Augsburg and paid homage to Otto. He and his son Adalbert remained Italian kings as Otto's vassals, though they had to cede the territory of the former March of Friuli to him, which the German king enfeoffed to his younger brother Duke Henry I of Bavaria as the Imperial March of Verona. When Otto had to deal with the revolt of his son, Duke Liudolf of Swabia in 953, Berengar attacked the Veronese march and also laid siege to Count Adalbert Atto's Canossa Castle.\n\nIn 960, Berengar invaded the Papal States under Pope John XII, on whose appeal finally King Otto, aiming at his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor, again marched against Italy. Berengar's troops deserted him and Otto by Christmas 961 had taken Pavia by default and declared Berengar deposed. He proceeded to Rome, where he was crowned emperor on 2 February 962. He then once more turned against Berengar, who was besieged at San Leo.\n\nMeanwhile, Pope John had entered on negotiations with Berengar's son Adalbert, which in 963 caused Otto to move into Rome, where he deposed the pope and had Pope Leo VIII elected. The next year, Berengar finally surrendered to Otto's forces, he was captured and imprisoned at Bamberg in Germany, where he died in August 966. His wife Willa spent the rest of her life in a German nunnery.\n"}

{"id": "1935320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935320", "title": "History of the Jews in Morocco", "text": "History of the Jews in Morocco\n\nMoroccan Jews constitute an ancient community. Before the founding of Israel in 1948, there were about 250,000 to 350,000 Jews in the country, which gave Morocco the largest Jewish community in the Muslim world, but by 2017 only 2,000 or so remain. Jews in Morocco, originally speakers of Berber languages, Judeo-Moroccan Arabic or Judaeo-Spanish, were the first in the country to adopt the French language, and unlike the general population French remains the main (and, in many cases, the exclusive) language of members of the Jewish community there.\n\nThe Jewish presence dates back over 2,500 years, to the time of the Carthaginian state. The Hebrew or Aramaic languages used by Jews were closely related to the Punic language of the Carthaginians; many Jews also settled amongst Berbers and adopted their languages.\nLater, under the dominion of the Romans and (after 429) the Vandals, Mauretanian Jews reportedly increased in number and prospered.\n\nAs Christianity was adopted by the Roman state, the church Councils of Carthage adopted policies that discriminated against adherents to Judaism. The Justinian edict of persecution for North Africa, issued after Vandal rule had been overthrown and Mauretania had come under the dominion of the Byzantines (534), was directed against the Jews as well as the Arians, the Donatists, and other dissenters.\n\nIn the 7th century, the Jewish population of Mauretania received as a further accession from Iberian Peninsula those who wished to escape Visigothic legislation. At the end of the same century, at the time of the great Arab conquests in northwestern Africa, there were in Mauretania, according to the Arab historians, many Jews.\n\nSince the city of Fez was founded in 808 CE, it attracted a diverse kind of population from all around the area, among those new newcomers came the Jews who contributed their commercial capabilities to the new developed economy. They settled in the medina of Fez, and formed a stable community, which was an integral part of the city life.\n\nThe golden age of the Jewish community in Fez lasted for almost three hundred years, from the 9th to 11th centuries. Its yeshivot (religious schools) attracted brilliant scholars, poets and grammarians. This period was marred by a pogrom in 1033, which is described by the Jewish Virtual Library as an isolated event primarily due to political conflict between the Maghrawa and Ifrenid tribes.\n\nThe Almoravids (Arab. Al-Murābiṭūn; \"Warrior-Monks\"), confederation of Berber tribes of the Sanhajah group who lived in the Moroccan Sahara Desert. Their religious fervor and fighting capabilities enabled them to establish a formidable empire in the Morocco and Muslim Spain in the 11th and 12th centuries. Their theological Islamic zeal is attributed to Yahya ibn Ibrahim, their spiritual leader, as well as to the 'alim (religious scholar) 'Abd Allah ibn Yasin. Imbued with Islamic zeal, the Almoravids conquered Morocco and major sections of western Algeria between 1054 and 1092. In 1062 they turned Marrakesh into their base of operations and religious capital. Thenceforth, their main leaders embraced the title of Amir al-Muslimin (\"commander of the Muslims\") but nevertheless continued to recognize the legitimacy of a still higher authority in Islam: the Abbasid caliph in Iraq upon whom the title Amir al-Mu'minīn (\"commander of the faithful\") had been bestowed. It was toward the end of the 11th century that the Castilian Christians who held on to parts of Spain began challenging the authority of the Almoravids and encroaching on their territories. The Almoravid leadership succeeded in temporarily repulsing the Christians and foiling their plans to conquer such key cities as Córdoba and Toledo.\n\nWith the exception of Valencia, Muslim Spain remained under Almoravid control. Notwithstanding, perhaps the weakest aspect of Almoravid rule in Spain and the Maghreb is the fact that they were a Muslim Berber minority in charge of a Spanish-Arab empire. With the passage of time, they found it increasingly difficult to protect all their territorial possessions from the Christian reconquest, especially in the aftermath of the fall of Saragossa in 1118. Moreover, in 1125 the Almohads (those who advocated the \"Unity of Allah\"), a confederation of rival Berber tribes, began to rebel against them in the Atlas Mountains. Following a protracted struggle and relentless fighting, the Almohads defeated the Almoravids in 1147; they transformed Marrakesh into their own capital and extended their authority into Muslim Spain.\n\nThe position of the Jews under Almoravid domination was apparently free of major abuses, though there are reports of increasing social hostility against them – particularly in Fes. Unlike the problems encountered by the Jews during the rule of the Almohads (the Almoravids' successor dynasty), there are not many factual complaints of excesses, coercion, or malice on the part of the authorities toward the Jewish communities. It is known, however, that Yusuf Ibn Tashfin forbade Jews living in the capital city Marrakesh. It was allowed for them to trade there, but if a Jew was caught in the city during night hours it was punishable by death.\n\nUnder the Almoravids, some Jews prospered (although far more so under Ali III, than under his father Yusuf ibn Tashfin). Among those who held the title of \"vizier\" () or \"nasih\" () in Almoravid times were the poet and physician Abu Ayyub Solomon ibn al-Mu'allam, Abraham ibn Meïr ibn Kamnial, Abu Isaac ibn Muhajar, and Solomon ibn Farusal.\n\nThe Dhimmi status, which called for the payment of jizya (taxes for non-Muslims) in exchange for a certain level of protection for religious minorities, came to an end under the strict militant dynasty of the Almohads, who came into power in 1146. Instead, the Almohads forced Jews to choose between conversion to Islam or death, compelling many Jews to convert, or at least pretend to. Due to the many similarities between Jewish and Islamic practice, Jews felt as though they could clandestinely maintain their Jewish practices under the guise of Islam. For example, names such as Benchekroun (initially Chokron or Choukroun or Chekroun depending on the pronunciation), El Kohen, and Kabbaj were Jewish in origin. Maimonides, who was staying in Fez with his father, is said to have written to the communities to comfort and encourage his brethren and fellow believers in this time of oppression In the above-mentioned elegy of Abraham ibn Ezra, which appears to have been written at the commencement of the period of the Almohads, and which is found in a Yemen siddur among the kinot prescribed for the Ninth of Ab, the Moroccan cities Ceuta, Meknes, the Draa River valley, Fez, and Segelmesa are especially emphasized as being exposed to great persecution. Joseph ha-Kohen relates that no remnant of Israel was left from Tangier to Mehdia.\n\nDue to the nature of the forced conversions, the later Almohads were no longer content with the repetition of a mere formula of belief in the unity of God and in the prophetic calling of Muhammad. The third Almohad Prince, Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur, spoke on this matter, saying “If I were sure about the sincerity of their Islam, I would let them mix with the Muslims…, and if I were sure of their unbelief, I would kill their men, enslave their offspring, and declare their property spoils for the Muslims. But I am uncertain about their case.” Thus, al-Mansur made an effort to distinguish the neo-Muslims from the “true” Muslims. He compelled them to wear distinguishing garments, with a very noticeable yellow cloth for a head-covering; from that time forward the clothing of the Jews formed an important subject in the legal regulations concerning them.\n\nThe reign of the Almohads on the whole exercised a most disastrous and enduring influence on the position of the Moroccan Jews. Already branded by their clothing as unbelievers, they furthermore became objects of scorn and violent despotic caprice from which there was no escape.\n\nAn account by Solomon Cohen dated January 1148 CE describes the Almohad conquests:\n\"Abd al-Mumin ... the leader of the Almohads after the death of Muhammad Ibn Tumart the Mahdi ... captured Tlemcen [in the Maghreb] and killed all those who were in it, including the Jews, except those who embraced Islam. ... [In Sijilmasa] One hundred and fifty persons were killed for clinging to their [Jewish] faith. ... One hundred thousand persons were killed in Fez on that occasion, and 120,000 in Marrakesh. The Jews in all [Maghreb] localities [conquered] ... groaned under the heavy yoke of the Almohads; many had been killed, many others converted; none were able to appear in public as Jews.\"\n\nThe Marinid dynasty (Berber: \"Imrinen\", Arabic: \"Marīniyūn\") was a dynasty of Zenata Berber descent that ruled Morocco from the 13th to the 15th century.\n\nThe Marinids overtook the Almohads controlling Morocco in 1244, and briefly controlled all the Maghreb in the mid-14th century. They supported the Kingdom of Granada in Al-Andalus in the 13th and 14th centuries; an attempt to gain a direct foothold on the European side of the Strait of Gibraltar was however defeated at the Battle of Salado in 1340 and finished after the Castilian conquest of Algeciras from the Marinids in 1344.\n\nDuring Marinid rule, Jews were able to return to their religion and practices, once again outwardly professing their Judaism under the protection of the dhimmi status. They were able to re-establish their lives and communities, returning to some sense of normalcy and security. They also established strong vertical relations with the Marinid sultans. When the still-fanatic mobs attacked them in 1275, the Merinid sultan Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd Al-Haqq intervened personally to save them. The sovereigns of this dynasty benevolently received the Jewish ambassadors of the Christian kings of Spain and admitted Jews among their closest courtiers. Of these Jews, Khalifa b. Waqqāsa (Ruqqasa) became steward of the household of the sultan Abu Yaqub Yusuf an-Nasr and his intimate counselor. A victim of palace intrigues, he was put to death in 1302. His nephew, who was also named Khalifa, held the same office and suffered the same fate (1310). However, there were no repercussions against the Moroccan Jews as a result of the execution of their powerful coreligionists. They were the principal factors in the prosperity of the country. The Sahara gold trade, which was of primary importance, and the exchange with the Christian countries were completely under their control. Their relatives and associates in the kingdom of Aragon financed, when necessary, the navies which defended the Moroccan ports. In addition to the jizya (tax paid by non-Muslims), they paid enormous sums to the treasury in customs duties for their imports and exports. In the outlying areas, particularly in the Atlas region where there were large concentrations of Jews of early origin, the Jews wielded great influence in both the political and spiritual domains. Jewish physicians enjoyed well-deserved renown. The study of Kabbalah, as well as philosophy, was then in vogue. The last Moroccan philosopher of the Middle Ages was Judah b. Nissim ibn Malkah, who was still alive in 1365.\n\nThe last ruler of the Marinid dynasty, Abd al-Haqq II, appointed many Jews to high positions. The appointment of Jews to high positions, such as vizier, angered many Muslims, as they viewed such increases in Jewish power as transgressing the dhimmi status. Abd al-Basit b. Khalil, a medieval Moroccan author, claims that Jews became arrogant with their newfound prestige, using their power to command Muslims. This is a clear disruption to the established social order. Once a rumor began to circulate that the Jewish vizier in Fez, Aaron Batash, struck a Muslim woman, there were public outcries amongst Fez's Muslim population. They demanded the Mufti (Islamic legal expert) to issue a Fatwa (legal opinion) to permit the killing of Jews in the name of the Allah. The Mufti had no choice but to make these killings permissible. Thus, began the 1465 Moroccan revolt, one of the worst pogroms in Morocco's history.\n\nBy 1249, the Spanish \"Reconquista\" had concluded its main phase. During the murderous scenes enacted in 1391 in Spain, Spanish-controlled Seville, and Majorca, the Sephardi Jews of Spain seized the opportunity to emigrate to North Africa in order to escape persecution. A hundred years later, King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile issued the Alhambra Decree - an edict ordering the expulsion of practicing Jews from Spain. Consequently, the Jews were driven from Spain in 1492, and later from Portugal in 1496 following a similar decree by King Manuel I of Portugal. The sudden inroad of Jews into Morocco and the whole of North Africa was then repeated on a much larger scale.\n\nFollowing the 1465 Moroccan revolt under the Marinid dynasty, the native Jewish community in Morocco had shrunken substantially, having been massacred and marginalized. The Moroccan Jewry began to recover from the pogroms of 1465 under the Wattasid dynasty, a ruling group of Zenata Berbers which had gained control during the fall of the Marinid in 1472. The Jewish community in Morocco then swelled with the waves of refugees arriving from Spain and Portugal after 1492, increasing the cultural and economic power of the Moroccan Jewish community considerably. Incoming Sephardi Jews tended to be economically better off than their native counterparts, bringing with them specific ideas of culture shaped by centuries of life on the Iberian Peninsula. As a result, the Sephardic scholarly mercantile elite were quick to dominate Jewish communal life in Morocco.A number of natives from Fez fled to Spain over the course of the fifteenth century and returned to Fez following 1492, acting as a unique bridge between the native Jews of Morocco and the newly arrived Sephardim. Among this group, the most outstanding representatives were the Ibn Danan family. Fleeing from Fez in either 1438 or 1465, the Ibn Danans settled in Granada where Rabbi Moses Maimon Ibn Danan and his son Saadiah achieved fame as scholars. Saadiah returned to Fez after the Spanish expulsion and served as a spiritual guide for other exiles, whilst identifying himself with the native Jews. The Ibn Danan family was among the intellectual and financial elite of Fez for centuries, creating alliances across Sephardi families and maintaining a prominent synagogue in Fez.\n\nThe arrival of Spanish Jewish refugees brought important changes in city life and within the preexisting Jewish community. Jewish life in the Muslim interior of Morocco became dominated by the Sephardic plutocracy that continued to maintain control of the Moroccan Jewry up until modern times. Each local community had a \"rigid\", or \"shaykh al-Yahud\", who was appointed by the government. The chief figure in the larger Jewish community was the \"Nagid\" of the capital, who was invariably a court Jew. Throughout the Moroccan Jewish community, there were famous Sephardic \"dayyanim\" such as the Ibn Danans whose authority was largely recognized by Jews within the whole country. However, the influx of refugees also caused overcrowding in the larger cities of Morocco and aroused uneasiness among both the Muslims, who feared an increase in the price of necessities, and the Jews already settled there, who had hitherto barely succeeded in creating a livelihood in handicrafts and petty commerce.\n\nWhile many Spanish Jewish exiles to Morocco were able to successfully integrate into the larger community in part due to their relative wealth, the problem of poverty among exiles still left a significant number of Jewish refugees vulnerable. Many died of hunger and some returned to Spain; most fled to Fez, where new challenges awaited them. More than 20,000 Jews died in and around Fez following a terrible fire and subsequent famine in the Jewish quarter of the city.\n\nDespite the trials faced by Jews in Morocco, numerous \"New Christians\" - also referred to as \"\"Marranos\"\" - that still remained in Spain and Portugal following the expulsions endeavored to make their way to North Africa. In response to this, King Manuel I issued a number of ordinances in 1499 forbidding the emigration of New Christians without explicit royal permission. Nevertheless, with monetary and transportive aid from figures already established in the Jewish diaspora, many New Christians succeeded in immigrating to North Africa.\n\nA new group of New Christians came to Morocco through the establishment of the Inquisition in Portugal under Pope Paul III in 1536. In 1508, Portugal had come to occupy parts of Morocco, succeeding in conquering the old seaport town of Safi, which had a large number of Jewish inhabitants and had subsequently become an important commercial center. In 1510, Safi was besieged by a large Moorish army. Following this, some Portuguese Jews brought assistance to the besieged with ships manned by coreligionists and equipped at their own cost.\n\nIn Safi, the Jews were allowed to live as such by King Manuel I's permission; in addition to Asilah after 1533, which had long been a Portuguese possession. In the quarrels which took place afterwards between the Moors and the governors of Azamur, the Wattasid sultans employed some of the well-connected immigrants as commercial and diplomatic go-betweens with the Portuguese crown. Men such as Rabbi Abraham b. Zamiro of Safi, and Jacob Rosales and Jacob Rute of Fez, were as much agents of Portugal as Morocco. The Wattasids also took in their service some Jewish artisans and technicians who possessed strategic military skills. These men were employed in much the same spirit as Christian mercenaries, and were generally not considered to be government officials with any administrative authority over Muslims.\n\nThe Saadi dynasty or Saadian dynasty was a dynasty of Arab descent that ruled Morocco from 1554 to 1659.\n\nFrom 1509 to 1554 they had ruled only in the south of Morocco. While still recognizing the Wattasids as Sultans until 1528, Saadian's growing power led the Wattasids to attack them and, after an indecisive battle, to recognize their rule over southern Morocco through the Treaty of Tadla.\n\nTheir reign over Morocco began with the reign of Sultan Mohammed ash-Sheikh in 1554, when he vanquished the last Wattasids at the Battle of Tadla. The Saadian rule ended in 1659 with the end of the reign of Sultan Ahmad el Abbas.\nWhen, in 1578, the young king Sebastian with almost his whole army met death, and Portugal saw the end of her glory, in the Battle of Alcazarquivir, the few nobles who remained were taken captive and sold to the Jews in Fez and Morocco. The Jews received the Portuguese knights, their former countrymen, into their houses very hospitably and let many of them go free on the promise that they would send back their ransom from Portugal.\n\nSamuel Pallache of the Sephardi Pallache family, having earned the confidence of Zaydan An-Nasser, had a significant role in Morocco–Netherlands relations, serving as the interpreter for his embassador Hammu ben Bashir in a journey to the Dutch Republic, then again with Ahmad ben Abdallah al-Hayti al-Maruni, which led to the signing of the Dutch-Moroccan Treaty of Friendship and Free Commerce in 1611.\n\nNumerous newly immigrated Jews, whose descendants faithfully adhere to the use of their Spanish dialects, Ladino and Haketia to the present day and who surpass older Jewish Moroccans in education and intellectual achievement, subsequently become prominent in Moroccan history. With their skill in European commerce, arts, and handicrafts, hitherto largely unknown to the Moors, and with their wealth, Jews have contributed conspicuously to the rise and development of the Alaouite Dynasty since its beginning in 1666.\nAt first the Sa'dis appeared to be fanatical religious zealots who were intolerant of non-Muslims. They imposed heavy taxes on the local Jewish community. As they consolidated their authority in the country, however, they gradually evinced greater toleration toward the Jewish minority. Like their Wattasid predecessors, the Sa'di sultans now employed Jews as physicians, diplomatic emissaries, and interpreters. Beginning in 1603, Abraham bin Wach and later Judah Levi served as ministers of the treasury. Members of the Jewish aristocratic Cabessa and Palache families were recruited by the sultan's court as agents and negotiators with European merchants who entered the country. Whereas the authorities increasingly proved to be friendly toward the Jews, the same could hardly be said of the Muslim masses as well as local urban and rural chieftains and governors.\n\nThe Jews suffered much during the great conquests of Moulay Rashid, who united the separate parts of Morocco into one single state, and wished to add to it all northwest Africa. According to Chénier, when Al-Raschid took the city of Marrakech in 1670, at the desire of the inhabitants he caused the Jewish counselor and governor of the ruling prince Abu Bakr, together with the latter and his whole family, to be publicly burned, in order to inspire terror among the Jews. He also tore down the synagogues of the city, expelled many Jews from the Berber region of Sus and treated them tyrannically. His demands on the Jews in the way of taxes were enormous; he had them collected by Joshua ben Hamoshet, a rich Jew, to whom he was under obligations for various services and whom he appointed chief over the Jews. He even ordered the Jews to supply wine to the Christian slaves.\n\nIn 1668 the Jewish community of Chaouya settled in Fez after Mulai Rashid attacked the town of Chaouya. They were given three days to leave and left with their rabbi Maimon Aflalo. They numbered around 1300 households and possessed great wealth. After they moved to Fez they were granted their own synagogue .\n\nMoulay Rashid's successor was his brother Ismail (Moulay Ismail) (1672), one of the cruelest of tyrants. On his accession Ismail appointed his Jewish adviser Joseph Toledani, son of Daniel Toledani, Moulay Raschid's counselor, to be his minister, in which capacity Joseph concluded a peace between Morocco and Holland. Under Ismail's rule the ruined synagogues were rebuilt, although his taxes on Jews were oppressive. One day, he threatened to compel them to accept Islam if their Messiah did not come within a definite time. The Jews understood the hint and satisfied his pious zeal with a very large sum of money. The Jews, who served as tax-collectors on the whole coast, used to give Ismail a golden riding-outfit as an annual \"present\"—an inducement to keep them in office—and a hen and a dozen chickens fashioned in gold as a tax payment for the whole Jewish community. Ismail had another way of securing money: for a certain sum he would sell to an aspirant for honors the position and wealth of one of his favorites. In one such transaction Maimaran, who was chief ruler over the Jews of the realm, feared a rival in Moses ibn 'Attar, and offered the sultan a certain sum for his head. Ismail then let Moses ibn 'Attar know how much had been offered for his head, whereupon Ibn 'Attar offered double the sum for the head of his opponent. The sultan took the money from both, called them fools, and reconciled them to each other, whereupon Ibn 'Attar married a daughter of Maimaran and shared with his father-in-law reign over the Jews. The same Moses ibn 'Attar was Moorish plenipotentiary in the making of a compact with Great Britain in 1721.\n\nAfter 1700 Fez no longer attracted as many Jews as in the previous centuries, while others still continued to arrive, other retained residence in Fez, while spend their time elsewhere.\n\nIn 1703 a controversy happened between the Jews of Chaouya residing in Fez to the rest of the Jewish community. They demanded from their communal leaders that the governmental taxes will be assessed for them separately. Furthermore, they had a bad relations with the rest of the community, and tried to form separate agreements with the government. Those two events, did not passed on eventually.\n\nThe two communities, those who came from Spain (megorashim) and the locals, finally melded together. Arabic was the main language, while unique Spanish rituals were kept and practiced. The number of the community members fluctuated through the following years. There were times of relative peace and times of epidemics and different crises. For example, in 1723 an extended drought transformed the mellah into a ghost town as many Jews escaped and abandoned the area. \"The houses of the rich are empty, their inhabitants have disappeared, the gates of the courtyards are closed, weeds grow up and robbers enter, stealing the doors and the beds. Many houses have been demolished, their stones and rafters taken away... Most of the streets of the mellah are deserted.\" Hunger took the lives of more than 2000 people and 1,000 more converted from Judaism.\n\nThe condition of the Jewish community was unchanged under Mohammed III (1757–89), who distinguished himself by his attempt to introduce European culture into his kingdom. His eldest son, Moulay Ali, governor of Fez, courageously opposed his father's suggestion to impose a tax upon that city in favor of his other brothers, which tax was to be paid by the Jewish community. He stated that the Jews of Fez were already so poor that they were unable to bear the present tax and that he was not willing to increase still further their misery. His minister was the Jew Elijah ha-Levi, who had at one time fallen into disgrace and had been given as a slave to a smuggler of Tunis, but had been restored to favor. The accession to the throne of Yazid, on the death of Mohammed III in 1789, led to a terrible massacre of the Moroccan Jews, having refused him their support in his fight with his brother for the succession. As a punishment the richer Jews of Tetouan, at his entry into the city, were tied to the tails of horses and dragged through the city. Many were killed in other ways or robbed. Jewish women were raped. The Spanish consul, Solomon Hazzan, was executed for alleged treachery, and the Jews of Tangier, Asilah, and Alcazarquivir were condemned to pay a large sum of money. Elijah, the minister of the former king, who had always opposed Yazid in the council, quickly embraced Islam to avoid being persecuted. He died soon after. The cruelty of the persecutors reached its climax in Fez. In Rabat, as in Meknes, the Jews were ill-treated. In Mogador, strife arose between the Jews and the city judge on the one hand, and the Moorish citizens on the other; the dispute was over the question of Jewish garb. Finally the Jews were ordered to pay 100,000 piasters and three shiploads of gunpowder; and most of them were arrested and beaten daily until the payment was made. Many fled beforehand to Gibraltar or other places; some died as martyrs; and some accepted Islam. The notables and the Muslim masses then rose to intervene on behalf of the Jews. They hid many of them in their houses and saved a great many others. In Rabat, the governor Bargash saved the community from the worst. The sanguinary events of the year 1790 have been poetically described in two kinot for the Ninth of Ab, by Jacob ben Joseph al-Mali? and by David ben Aaron ibn Husain.\n\nFrom the second half of this century various accounts of travels exist which give information concerning the external position of the Jews. Chénier, for example, describes them as follows:\n\"The Jews possess neither lands nor gardens, nor can they enjoy their fruits in tranquillity. They must wear only black, and are obliged when they pass near mosques, or through streets in which there are sanctuaries, to walk barefoot. The lowest among the Moors imagines he has a right to ill-treat a Jew, nor dares the latter defend himself, because the Koran and the judge are always in favor of the Mohammedan. Notwithstanding this state of oppression, the Jews have many advantages over the Moors: they better understand the spirit of trade; they act as agents and brokers, and they profit by their own cunning and by the ignorance of the Moors. In their commercial bargains many of them buy up the commodities of the country to sell again. Some have European correspondents; others are mechanics, such as goldsmiths, tailors, gunsmiths, millers, and masons. More industrious and artful, and better informed than the Moors, the Jews are employed by the emperor in receiving the customs, in coining money, and in all affairs and intercourse which the monarch has with the European merchants, as well as in all his negotiations with the various European governments.\"\nThere were, indeed, quite a number of such Jewish officials, negotiators, treasurers, councilors, and administrators at the Moroccan court, whom the European is inclined to call \"ministers\", but whom in reality the ruler used merely as intermediaries in extorting money from the people, and dismissed as soon as their usefulness in this direction was at an end. They were especially Jews from Spain, the megorashim, whose wealth, education, and statesmanship paved their way to the court here, as formerly in Spain. One of the first of such ministers was Shumel al-Barensi, at the beginning of the 16th century in Fez, who opened the \"state career\" to a long succession of coreligionists ending in the 19th century with Masado ben Leaho, prime minister and representative councilor of the emperor in foreign affairs. It would be erroneous to suppose that these Jewish dignitaries of the state succeeded in raising the position and the influence of their fellow believers, or that they even attempted to do so. They were usually very glad if they themselves were able to remain in office to the end of their lives.\n\nMoroccan Jews were employed also as ambassadors to foreign courts. At the beginning of the 17th century Pacheco in the Netherlands; Shumel al-Farrashi at the same place in 1610; after 1675 Joseph Toledani, who, as stated above, concluded peace with Holland; his son Hayyim in England in 1750; a Jew in Denmark. In 1780 Jacob ben Abraham Benider was sent as minister from Morocco to King George III; in 1794 a Jew named Sumbal and in 1828 Meïr Cohen Macnin were sent as Moroccan ambassadors to the English court.\n\nAnother event caused to a population decrease among the community was the two-year exile of the Jews from the mellah in 1790–1792, during the brief reign of sultan Malawy yazid . The whole community was forced to leave to Qasba Shrarda which was on the other side of Fez. This time the population of the Jews around the mellah was at the lowest stage of all time, and did not manage to \"heal\" itself. A mosque was built on the site of the main synagogue, under the order of yazid, tomb stones from a near Jewish cemetery was used to built the mosque, and the cemetery itself was moved to the entrance of the Muslim quarter along with the bones of the saintly rabbis. The exile lasted around for two years, and only after the death of yazid, the qadi of Fez ordered the mosque to be torn down and the Jews were permitted to return to their quarter.\n\nThe 19th century, which brought emancipation to the Jews of many countries, failed to fundamentally alter the status of Moroccan Jews, but produced new divisions among them and entailed new sources of trouble. In the mid 19th century, commercial development and European economic penetration brought prosperity to many Jewish merchants in northern Moroccan ports, but cost many Jews in the interior their traditional livelihoods, as industrial imports from Europe drove traditional Jewish crafts out of the market. As a result, Moroccan Jews started migrating from the interior to coastal cities such as Essaouira, Mazagan, Asfi, and later Casablanca for economic opportunity, participating in trade with Europeans and the development of those cities. Some impoverished migrants to overpopulated urban \"mellahs\" (Jewish quarters) struggled to survive as shopkeepers, peddlers, artisans or beggars.\n\nMorocco's instability and divisions also fueled conflicts, for which Jews were frequent scapegoats. The First Franco-Moroccan War in 1844 brought new misery and ill treatment upon the Moroccan Jews, especially upon those of Mogador (known as Essaouira). When the Hispano-Moroccan War broke out on September 22, 1859, the \"Mellah\" of Tetuan was sacked, and many Jews fled to Cadiz and Gibraltar for refuge.\n\nThis incident in the Battle of Tétouan of 1860 was covered by the European Jewish press, which led to an international effort called \"The Morocco Relief Fund.\" The persecution of Moroccan Jews was one of the motives for the foundation in 1860 of the Alliance Israélite Universelle (AIU), a French-based organization working for Jewish social and political equality and economic advancement worldwide.\n\nMorocco was one of the countries where the AIU was most active; it opened its first school in Tetuan in 1862, followed by schools in Tangier (1864), Essaouira (1866), and Asfi (1867). Eventually, it had 83 schools in Morocco, more than in the rest of the world combined. Over time, the AIU in Morocco was more and more closely associated with French colonial influence; one of its assistant secretary-generals later noted that its \"close, even organic relations with the (French foreign ministry) were an open secret.\"\n\nWhile the AIU failed to achieve much in increasing Moroccan Jews' political status, it did succeed in giving a significant minority of them modern French-language educations and in initiating them into French culture. This included a transformation of many Moroccan Jews' gender and sexual norms. For many centuries, Moroccan Jews and Muslims had shared such customs as polygamy, segregation of the sexes, early ages of female marriage, and a tolerance for men's love of male youths that was in contrast to both Jewish and Islamic scriptural prescriptions. The AIU set out to Europeanize Moroccan Jews' marriage patterns and family forms, combating prostitution, eliminating Jewish women's traditional head coverings, and reining-in on what it saw as Jewish men's promiscuity and homosexual tendencies. These changes required, in the words of an AIU alumni association in Tangiers in 1901, that Jewish mores be \"disengaged from the Muslim spirit\" – thus helping, like the AIU's activities generally, to increase Moroccan Jews' distance from an emerging Moroccan national identity. Levy Cohen founded the first francophone newspaper in Morocco, \"Le Reveil du Maroc\" , in 1883 to spread French language and culture among his coreligionists.\nIn 1863 Sir Moses Montefiore and the Board of Deputies of British Jews received a telegram from Morocco asking for help for a group of Jews who were imprisoned at Safi on suspicion of having killed a Spaniard. Two others had already been executed at the instigation of the Spanish consul; one of them publicly in Tangier, the other in Safi. Sir Moses, supported by the British government, undertook a journey to Morocco to demand the liberation of the imprisoned Jews and, as he said in a letter to the sultan, to move the latter \"to give the most positive orders that Jews and Christians, dwelling in all parts of Your Majesty's dominions, shall be perfectly protected, and that no person shall molest them in any manner whatsoever in anything which concerns their safety and tranquillity; and that they may be placed in the enjoyment of the same advantages as all other subjects of Your Majesty.\" Montefiore was successful in both attempts.\n\nThe prisoners were liberated, and on February 15, 1864, the sultan published an edict granting equal rights of justice to the Jews. This edict of emancipation was confirmed by Mohammed IV's son and successor, Moulay Hasan I, on his accession to the throne 1873 and again on September 18, 1880, after the Conference of Madrid.\n\nPro-Jewish reforms were often not executed by local magistrates in the fragmented sultanate, however, and even if they were they reignited animosity toward the Jewish population. Thus, for example, the sultan Sulaiman (1795–1822) decreed that the Jews of Fez might wear shoes; but so many Jews were killed in the streets of that city as a result of the edict that they themselves asked the sultan to repeal it. According to a statistical report of the AIU, for the years 1864–80 no less than 307 Jews were murdered in the city and district of Morocco, which crimes, although brought to the attention of the magistracy upon every occasion, remained unpunished.\n\nDuring this century and up to 1910, around 1000 Moroccan Jewish families migrated to the Amazon, in northern Brazil, during the rubber boom.\n\nEarly photographs of Moroccan Jewish families, taken in the early 20th century by German explorer and photographer Hermann Burchardt, are now held at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.\n\nThe status of Moroccan Jews was not substantially improved by the establishment in 1912 of a French protectorate over much of the country. By contrast with Algeria, where Jews obtained French citizenship en masse with the adoption of the Crémieux decree in 1870, the establishment of the French protectorate in Morocco cost many Jews the forms of European extraterritorial protection they had formerly enjoyed, relegating them once more to the status of or \"natives\" along with their Muslim compatriots.\n\nIn 1912, amid the insurrection that followed the disclosure of the Treaty of Fes, thousands of rebelling Moroccan soldiers entered and pillaged the \"Mellah\" of Fez, stopping only after French artillery rounds pounded the Jewish quarter. More than 50 Jews were killed and hundreds of homes and shops were destroyed or damaged. The events were known as Bloody Days of Fes or the \"\"Tritel\".\" \n\nIn Casablanca, the Hadida brothers edited \"Or Ha’Maarav\", or \"La Lumiere du Maroc\" (1922-1924), a Zionist newspaper written in Judeo-Arabic with Hebrew script, which ran from 1922 until the French authorities shut it down in 1924. It was followed by \"L'Avenir Illustré\" (1926-1940) a nationalist, pro-Zionist francophone newspaper, edited by Jonathan Thurz as well as \"l'Union Marocaine\" (1932-1940), a francophone newspaper in line with emancipatory views of the AIU, edited by Élie Nattaf. \"L'Avenir Illustré\" and \"L'Union Marocaine\" were both shut down by the Vichy regime.\n\nAs a community, Moroccan Jews sent significant numbers of children to study in French, at institutions such as the schools of the Alliance Israélite Universelle, a generation or two earlier than Moroccan Muslims. By the 1930s, however, increasing numbers of Moroccan Muslims had also started graduating from schools taught in French, demanding access to positions previously held by French citizens and by Moroccan Jews in French-owned businesses and in the colonial administration.\n\nIn 1940, \"Résident Général\" Charles Noguès implemented antisemitic decrees coming from Nazi-controlled Vichy government issued excluding Jews from public functions. Sultan Mohammed V refused \"Vichy’s plan to ghettoize and deport Morocco’s quarter of a million Jews to the killing factories of Europe,\" and, in an act of defiance, insisted on inviting all the rabbis of Morocco to the 1941 throne celebrations. However, the French government did impose some antisemitic laws against the sultan's will. Leon Sultan, of the Moroccan Communist Party, for example, was disbarred.\n\nThe racist laws had a negative effect on Moroccan Jews and put them in an uncomfortable position \"between an indifferent Muslim majority and an anti-Semitic settler class.\"\n\nIn 1948, approximately 265,000 Jews lived in Morocco. Around 2,500 live there now, mostly in Casablanca, but also in Fes and other main cities.\n\nIn June 1948, soon after Israel was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in Oujda and Djerada, and in Alcazarquivir killing 44 Jews. In 1948–9, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand a year. Through the early 1950s, Zionist organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as a valuable source of labor for the Jewish State. From 1948 on many Jews left Fes. Most emigrated to Israel while others went to France and Canada. In the 1950s and 1960s there were still active Jewish schools and organizations such as the Alliance Israélite Universelle which later closed as the Jewish population decreased.\n\nIn 1956, Morocco attained independence. Jews occupied several political positions, including three Members of the Parliament of Morocco and a Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. However, emigration to Israel jumped from 8,171 in 1954 to 24,994 in 1955, increasing further in 1956. Beginning in 1956, emigration to Israel was prohibited until 1961, although it continued illegally until it was officially resumed. In 1961, the government relaxed the laws on emigration to Israel, as part of an agreement with Israel that entailed a payment to Morocco for each Jew that left the country for Israel. When Mohammed V died, Jews joined Muslims in a national day of mourning. But over the next three years, more than 80,000 Moroccan Jews immigrated to Israel. By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.\n\nThe Six-Day War in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide including in Morocco. By 1971, its Jewish population was down to 35,000; however, most of this new wave of emigration went to Europe and North America rather than Israel. France for a time was a destination particularly for Moroccan Jews with European educations, who had economic opportunities there; one study of Moroccan Jewish brothers, one of whom settled in France and the other in Israel, showed that 28 percent of the brothers who settled in France became managers, businessmen or professionals (compared to 13 percent of their Israeli brothers) and only 4 percent unskilled workers (compared to over a third of their Israeli brothers). Moroccan Jews in Israel, far more numerous, enjoyed less upward mobility: 51 percent were blue-collar in 1961 and 54 percent as late as 1981.\n\nDespite their current small numbers, Jews continue to play a notable role in Morocco. The King retains a Jewish senior adviser, André Azoulay. They are well represented in business and even a small number in politics and culture. Jewish schools and synagogues receive government subsidies. However, Jews were targeted in the Casablanca bombings of May 2003. King Hassan II's pleas to former Moroccan Jews to return have largely been ignored.\n\nIn 2004 Marrakech had an aging population of about 260 Jews, most over the age of 60, while Casablanca had between 3,000 and 4,000 Jews. A 2014 figure says there are about 2,500 Jews still living in Morocco. As of 2018 the total of Jews in Morocco is 2,200. Meanwhile, the State of Israel is home to nearly 1,000,000 Jews of Moroccan descent, around 15% of the nation's total population.\n\nIn 2013, it was revealed that there is a rapidly growing trend of Moroccan-Jewish families sending their sons to study at the Jerusalem College of Technology in Israel. Most of these students opt to take up Israeli citizenship and settle in Israel after graduating. Conversely, a small trickle of criminals from Israel have been settling in Morocco, exploiting the lack of an extradition treaty between the two nations. However, most of these are not of Moroccan descent. There are still many Jewish citizens in Morocco who choose to raise their children in the Jewish faith, and most of those children are sent to the Alliance Israélite Universelle school. However, the majority of students at this school pursue higher education in other countries and leave Morocco.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1935323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935323", "title": "Salammbô", "text": "Salammbô\n\nSalammbô (1862) is a historical novel by Gustave Flaubert. It is set in Carthage during the 3rd century BC, immediately before and during the Mercenary Revolt which took place shortly after the First Punic War. Flaubert's main source was Book I of Polybius's \"Histories\". The novel jumpstarted a renewed interest in the history of the Roman Republic's conflict with the North African Phoenician colony of Carthage.\n\nContemporary readers, familiar with Flaubert's previous realistic work, \"Madame Bovary\", were shocked and, in some instances, appalled by the indiscriminate violence and sensuality prevalent throughout the novel, which is why, notwithstanding the praise it received for its style and story, \"Salammbô\" remains controversial in literary circles to this day. Nevertheless, it was a massive best-seller, which sealed the author's reputation as one of the most prominent French writers of the 19th century, with even some of the Carthaginian costumes described influencing contemporary French fashion. Since then, however, it has fallen into obscurity in much of the Anglophone world. \n\nIn 1857, Flaubert decides to start doing research on Carthage. In March of that year, he writes a letter to Félicien de Saulcy, a French archeologist, to learn about the region’s past.\n\nFrom April 12 to June 5, 1858, Flaubert travels to Tunisia in order to research Carthage’s past. He also wants to see with his own eyes the country in which his novel will take place.\n\nIn a letter to Mme de Chantepie, dated January 23, 1858, he tells her about his travel plans. “I absolutely have to go to Africa. This is why, around the end of March, I will go back to the country of exotic dates. I am giddy with excitement. I will once again spend my days on horseback and my nights in a tent. What a happy breath I will take as I get onboard the steam boat in Marseilles!”\n\nAfter the First Punic War, Carthage is unable to fulfill promises made to its army of mercenaries, and finds itself under attack. The fictional title character, a priestess and the daughter of Hamilcar Barca, the foremost Carthaginian general, is the object of the obsessive lust of Matho, a leader of the mercenaries. With the help of the scheming freed slave, Spendius, Matho steals the sacred veil of Carthage, the Zaïmph, prompting Salammbô to enter the mercenaries' camp in an attempt to steal it back. The Zaïmph is an ornate bejewelled veil draped about the statue of the goddess Tanit in the \"sanctum sanctorum\" of her temple: the veil is the city's guardian and touching it will bring death to the perpetrator.\n\n\nThe transliterations follow J. W. Matthews's English version.\n\n\nIt was at Megara, a suburb of Carthage, in the gardens of Hamilcar, that the soldiers whom he had commanded in Sicily were holding a great feast to celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of Eryx. The master was absent, their numbers were large, and accordingly they ate and drank in perfect freedom.—The opening words.The brazen arms were working more quickly. They paused no longer. Every time that a child was placed in them the priests of Moloch spread out their hands upon him to burden him with the crimes of the people, vociferating: \"They are not men but oxen!\" and the multitude round about repeated: \"Oxen! oxen!\" The devout exclaimed: \"Lord! Eat!\".—Chapter 13 (\"Moloch\"), the passage describing the burning of the children inside the huge, hollow brass statue of the Baal Moloch.\n\nThere are departures from Polybius's historical account, although some of them were made intentionally by Flaubert. For example, in reality it was not Hanno who was crucified by the mercenaries but a Carthaginian general known as Hannibal. Fearing that the readers would mistakenly assume this figure to be the famed military commander of the Second Punic War, the author changed the name of his novel counterpart.\n\n\"Salammbô\" inspired Jacques Martin to create his historical comics series \"Alix\". \n\n\n\n\nTexts\nAudio\nOther\n"}

{"id": "1935334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935334", "title": "History of the Jews in Egypt", "text": "History of the Jews in Egypt\n\nEgyptian Jews constitute both one of the oldest and youngest Jewish communities in the world. The historic core of the Jewish community in Egypt consisted mainly of Arabic-speaking Rabbanites and Karaites. After their expulsion from Spain, more Sephardi and Karaite Jews began to emigrate to Egypt and their numbers increased significantly with the growth of trading prospects after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. As a result, Jews from all over the territories of the Ottoman Empire as well as Italy and Greece started to settle in the main cities of Egypt, where they thrived. The Ashkenazi community, mainly confined to Cairo's Darb al-Barabira quarter, began to arrive in the aftermath of the waves of pogroms that hit Europe in the latter part of the 19th century.\n\nIn the 1950s, Egypt began to expel its Jewish population (estimated at between 75,000 and 80,000 in 1948), also sequestering Jewish-owned property at this time.\n\nIn 2016, an article in an Egyptian periodical contained a quote from Magda Tania Haroun (the president of Cairo's Jewish community) which seemed to imply that there were only 6 Jews remaining in the entire country, all of them women over age 65. However, a subsequent article in another periodical clarified that she was specifically referring to the Jews remaining in Cairo (where she is based) and that there are a further 12 Jews in the city of Alexandria, whose spiritual leader is Ben Youssef Gaon. With the death of Magda's mother, Marcelle Haroun, at the age of 93, in July 2019, left only five Jews in Cairo.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible, especially the Books of Genesis and Exodus, describes a long period during which the children of Israel, also called Israelites, lived in the Nile Delta of ancient Egypt. The Egyptians appear to have called them Hebrews and enslaved them. The Israelites, by then organised into twelve tribes, escaped servitude, spending three months in the wilderness of Sinai. This narrative is not corroborated by any historical evidence, with the Israelites first appearing in the archeological record on the Merneptah Stele from between 1208–1203 BCE at the end of the Bronze Age. \n\nA reasonably Bible-friendly interpretation is that the Hebrews/Israelites were a federation of Habiru tribes of the hill-country around the Jordan River. Presumably, this federation consolidated into the kingdom of Israel, and Judah split from that, during the Dark Age that followed the Bronze. The Bronze Age term \"Habiru\" was less specific than the Biblical \"Hebrew\". The term referred simply to Levantine nomads, of any religion or ethnicity. Mesopotamian, Hittite, Canaanite, and Egyptian sources describe the Habiru largely as bandits, mercenaries, and slaves. Certainly, there were some Habiru slaves in ancient Egypt, but native Egyptian kingdoms were not heavily slave-based.\n\nIn the Elephantine papyri, caches of legal documents and letters written in Aramaic amply document the lives of a community of Jewish soldiers stationed there as part of a frontier garrison in Egypt for the Achaemenid Empire. Established at Elephantine in about 650 BCE during Manasseh's reign, these soldiers assisted Pharaoh Psammetichus I in his Nubian campaign. Their religious system shows strong traces of Babylonian polytheism, something which suggests to certain scholars that the community was of mixed Judaeo-Samaritan origins, and they maintained their own temple, functioning alongside that of the local deity Chnum. The documents cover the period 495 to 399 BCE.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible also records that a large number of Judeans took refuge in Egypt after the destruction of the Kingdom of Judah in 597 BCE, and the subsequent assassination of the Jewish governor, Gedaliah. (, ) On hearing of the appointment, the Jewish population fled to Moab, Ammon, Edom and in other countries returned to Judah. () However, before long Gedaliah was assassinated, and the population that was left in the land and those that had returned ran away to Egypt for safety. (, ) The numbers that made their way to Egypt are subject to debate. In Egypt, they settled in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Noph, and Pathros. ()\n\nFurther waves of Jewish immigrants settled in Egypt during the Ptolemaic era, especially around Alexandria. Thus, their history in this period centers almost completely on Alexandria, though daughter communities rose up in places like the present Kafr ed-Dawar, and Jews served in the administration as custodians of the river. As early as the 3rd century BCE, one can speak of a widespread diaspora of Jews in many Egyptian towns and cities. In Josephus's history, it is claimed that, after the first Ptolemy took Judea, he led some 120,000 Jewish captives to Egypt from the areas of Judea, Jerusalem, Samaria, and Mount Gerizim. With them, many other Jews, attracted by the fertile soil and Ptolemy's liberality, emigrated there of their own accord. An inscription recording a Jewish dedication of a synagogue to Ptolemy and Berenice was discovered in the 19th century near Alexandria.\nJosephus also claims that, soon after, these 120,000 captives were freed from bondage by Philadelphus.\n\nThe history of the Alexandrian Jews dates from the foundation of the city by Alexander the Great, 332 BCE, at which they were present. They were numerous from the very outset, forming a notable portion of the city's population under Alexander's successors. The Ptolemies assigned them a separate section, two of the five districts of the city, to enable them to keep their laws pure of indigenous cultic influences. The Alexandrian Jews enjoyed a greater degree of political independence than elsewhere. While the Jewish population elsewhere throughout the later Roman Empire frequently formed private societies for religious purposes, or organized corporations of ethnic groups like the Egyptian and Phoenician merchants in the large commercial centers, those of Alexandria constituted an independent political community, side by side with that of the other ethnic groups.\n\nFor the Roman period, there is evidence that at Oxyrynchus (modern \"Behneseh\"), on the west side of the Nile, there was a Jewish community of some importance. Many of the Jews there may have become Christians, though they retained their Biblical names (e.g., \"David\" and \"Elisabeth,\" occurring in litigation concerning an inheritance). There is even found a certain Jacob, son of Achilles (c. 300 CE), as beadle of an Egyptian temple.\n\nThe Hellenistic Jewish community of Alexandria translated the Old Testament into Greek. This translation is called the \"Septuagint\". The translation of the Septuagint itself began in the 3rd century BCE and was completed by 132 BCE, initially in Alexandria, but in time elsewhere as well. It became the source for the Old Latin, Slavonic, Syriac, Old Armenian, Old Georgian and Coptic versions of the Christian Old Testament.\n\nThe Jewish community of Alexandria was \"extinguished\" by Trajan's army during the Kitos War of 115–117 CE, also known as the Diaspora Revolt. The Jewish revolt, which is said to have begun in Cyrene and spread to Egypt, was largely motivated by religious zealotry, aggravation after the failed Great Revolt and destruction of the Temple, and anger at discriminatory laws.\n\nThe greatest blow Alexandrian Jews received was during the Byzantine Empire rule and the rise of a new state religion: Christianity. It was the expulsion of the Jews from Alexandria (so-called Alexandria Expulsion) in 414 or 415 A.D. under the leadership of Saint Cyril. Later violence took on a decidedly anti-Semitic context with calls for ethnic cleansing. Before that time, state/religious-sanctioned claims of a Jewish pariah were not common. Gibbon in his The history of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, chapter 47, describes the Alexandria pogrom:\n\nWithout any legal sentence, without any royal mandate, the patriarch (Saint Cyril), at the dawn of day, led a seditious multitude to the attack of the synagogues. Unarmed and unprepared, the Jews were incapable of resistance; their houses of prayer were leveled with the ground, and the episcopal warrior, after rewarding his troops with the plunder of their goods, expelled from the city the remnant of the unbelieving nation.\n\nSome authors estimate that around 100 thousand Jews were expelled from the city. The expulsion then continued in the nearby regions of Egypt and Palestine followed by a forced Christianization of the Jews.\n\nThe Arab invasion of Egypt at first found support from Jewish residents as well, disgruntled by the corrupt administration of the Patriarch Cyrus of Alexandria, notorious for his Monotheletic proselytizing. In addition to the Jewish population settled there from ancient times, some are said to have come from the Arabian Peninsula. The letter sent by Muhammad to the Jewish \"Banu Janba\" in 630 is said by Al-Baladhuri to have been seen in Egypt. A copy, written in Hebrew characters, has been found in the Cairo Geniza.\n\nMany Jewish residents had no reason to feel kindly toward the former masters of Egypt. In 629 the Emperor Heraclius I had driven the Jewish population from Jerusalem, and this was followed by massacres of Jewish residents throughout the empire—in Egypt, often aided by the Coptic population, who may have been trying to settle old grievances against Jewish groups, dating from the Persian conquest of Amida at the time of Emperor Anastasius I (502) and of Alexandria by the Persian general Shahin Vahmanzadegan (617), when some of the Jewish residents sided with the conquerors. The \"Treaty of Alexandria\" (November 8, 641), which sealed the Arab conquest of Egypt, expressly stipulated that the Jewish residents were to be allowed to remain in that city unmolested; and at the time of the capture of that city, 'Amr ibn al-'As, in his letter to the caliph, relates that he found there 40,000 Jews.\n\nOf the fortunes of the Jewish population of Egypt under the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates (641–868), little is known. Under the Tulunids (863-905), the Karaite community enjoyed robust growth.\n\nAt this time, Jews from North Africa came to settle in Egypt after the Fatimid conquest of Egypt in 969. These Jewish immigrants made up a significant amount of the population from all the Jews living in Egypt. Due to the discovery of the Cairo Geniza documents at the end of the 19th century, a lot is known about Egyptian Jews. From private records, letters, public records, and documents, these sources held the information about the society of the Egyptian Jews.\n\nThe rule of the Fatimid Caliphate was in general favorable for the Jewish communities, except the latter portion of al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah's reign. The foundation of Talmudic schools in Egypt is usually placed at this period. One of the Jewish citizens who rose to high position in that society was Ya'qub ibn Killis.\n\nThe caliph al-Hakim (996–1020) vigorously applied the Pact of Umar, and compelled the Jewish residents to wear bells and to carry in public the wooden image of a calf. A street in the city, al-Jawdariyyah, was designated for Jewish residency. Al-Hakim, hearing allegations that some mocked him in verses, had the whole quarter burned down.\n\nIn the beginning of the 12th century, a Jewish man named Abu al-Munajja ibn Sha'yah was at the head of the Department of Agriculture. He is especially known as the constructor of a Nile sluice (1112), which was called after him \"Baḥr Abi al-Munajja\". He fell into disfavor because of the heavy expenses connected with the work, and was incarcerated in Alexandria, but was soon able to free himself. A document concerning a transaction of his with a banker has been preserved. Under the vizier Al-Malik al-Afḍal (1137) there was a Jewish master of finances, whose name, however, is unknown. His enemies succeeded in procuring his downfall, and he lost all his property. He was succeeded by a brother of the Christian patriarch, who tried to drive the Jews out of the kingdom. Four leading Jews worked and conspired against the Christian, with what result is not known. There has been preserved a letter from this ex-minister to the Jews of Constantinople, begging for aid in a remarkably intricate poetical style. One of the physicians of the caliph Al-Ḥafiẓ (1131–49) was a Jew, Abu Manṣur (Wüstenfeld, p. 306). Abu al-Faḍa'il ibn al-Nakid (died 1189) was a celebrated oculist.\n\nAs for government power in Egypt, the highest legal authority who was called chief scholar was held by Ephraim. Later on in the 11th century, this position was held by a father and son with the names of Shemarya b. Elhanan and Elhanan b. Shemarya. Soon the chief of the Palestinian Jews took over the position of chief scholar for the Rabbinates after the death of Elhanan. Around 1065, a Jewish leader was recognized as \"ráīs al-Yahūd\" meaning the head of the Jews in Egypt. Later for a sixty-year rule, three family members of court physicians took the position of \"ráīs al-Yahūd\" whose names were Judah b. Såadya, Mevorakh b. Såadya, and Moses b. Mevorakh. The position was eventually handed down from Moses Maimonides in the late 12th century to early 15th centuries and was given to his descendants.\n\nAs for the Jewish population, there were over 90 Jewish inhabitants known during the 11th and 12th centuries. These inhabitants which included cities, towns, and villages, contained over 4,000 Jewish citizens. Also for the Jewish population, a little more light is thrown upon the communities in Egypt through the reports of certain Jewish scholars and travelers who visited the country. Judah Halevi was in Alexandria in 1141, and dedicated some beautiful verses to his fellow resident and friend Aaron Ben-Zion ibn Alamani and his five sons. At Damietta Halevi met his friend, the Spaniard Abu Sa'id ibn Ḥalfon ha-Levi. About 1160 Benjamin of Tudela was in Egypt; he gives a general account of the Jewish communities which he found there. At Cairo there were 2,000 Jews; at Alexandria 3,000, whose head was the French-born R. Phineas b. Meshullam; in the Faiyum there were 20 families; at Damietta 200; at Bilbeis, east of the Nile, 300 persons; and at Damira 700.\n\nSaladin's war with the Crusaders (1169–93) does not seem to have affected the Jewish population with communal struggle. A Karaite doctor, Abu al-Bayyan al-Mudawwar (d. 1184), who had been physician to the last Fatimid, treated Saladin also. Abu al-Ma'ali, brother-in-law of Maimonides, was likewise in his service. In 1166 Maimonides went to Egypt and settled in Fostat, where he gained much renown as a physician, practising in the family of Saladin and in that of his vizier al-Qadi al-Fadil|Ḳaḍi al-Faḍil al-Baisami, and Saladin's successors. The title \"Ra'is al-Umma\" or \"al-Millah\" (Head of the Nation or of the Faith), was bestowed upon him. In Fostat he wrote his \"Mishneh Torah\" (1180) and \"The Guide for the Perplexed\", both of which evoked opposition from Jewish scholars. From this place he sent many letters and responsa; and in 1173 he forwarded a request to the North African communities for help to secure the release of a number of captives. The original of the last document has been preserved. He caused the Karaites to be removed from the court.\n\nIn the mid thirteenth century the Ayyubid empire was plagued with famine, disease, and conflict; a great period of upheaval would see the Golden Islamic Period come to a violent end. Foreign powers began to encircle the Islamic World as the French endeavored on the 7th crusade in 1248 and the Mongol campaigns in the east rapidly making its way into the heartland of Islam. These internal and external pressure weakened the Ayyubid empire.\n\nIn 1250 following the death of Sultan Al Alih Ayyub,  slave soldiers, Mamluks, rose up and slaughtered all the Ayyubid heirs and the Mamluk leader Emir Aybak became the new sultan. The Mamluks were quick to consolidate power using a strong spirit of defense growing among Muslim faithfuls to rally victoriously against the Mongols in 1260 and consolidating the remnants of the Ayyubid Syria in 1299.\n\nIn this period of aggressive posturing the ulema were quick to denounce foreign influences to safeguard the purity of Islam. This led to unfortunate situations for Mamluk Jews. In 1300 Sultan Al-Nasir Qalawan ordered all Jews under his rule to wear yellow headgear to isolate the Egyptian Jewish community.  This law would be enforced for centuries and later amended in 1354 to force all Jews to wear a sign in addition to yellow head-wear. On multiple occasions the ulema persuaded the government to close or convert synagogues. Even major places of pilgrimage for Egyptian Jews such as the Dammah Synagogue were forced to close in 1301. Jews subsequently were excluded from bath houses and were prohibited to work in the national treasury. This repression of the Jewish community would continue for centuries, but it would be relatively infrequent to Jews living in Christendom.\n\nIn all the religious fervor of the period the Mamluks began to adopt Sufi Islam in an attempt to assuage dissatisfaction with traditional Sunni Islam facilitated solely by the Sultan. At the same time the Mamluk government was unwilling to relinquish control of religion to a clerical class. They endeavored on a massive project of inviting and subsidizing Sufi clerics in an attempt to promote a new state religion. All throughout the country new government-backed Sufi brotherhoods and saint cults grew almost overnight and was able to quell the disapproval of the population. The Mamluk Sultanate would become a safe haven for Sufi mystics all throughout the Islamic world. Across the empire state-sponsored Sufi ceremonies were a clear sign of the full-fledged shift that took hold.\n\nJews who for the most part were kept segregated from Arab communities first came into contact with Sufism in these state sponsored ceremonies, as they were obliged to attend out of a show of loyalty to the sultan. It is in these ceremonies where many Egyptian Jews first came into contact with Sufism and it would eventually spark a massive movement amongst the Mamluk Jews.\n\nNow most Egyptian Jews of the time were members of the Karaite sect. This was  a 1st-century anti-Pharisee movement who rejected the teachings of the Talmud. It is believed by historians such as Paul Fenton that the Karaites settled in Egypt as early as the 7th century, and Egypt would remain a bastion for Karaites all the way through the 19th century. As time passed in contact with these relatively new Sufi ideas many Karaites began to push towards reform. Admiration for the structure of Hanaqas, Sufi schools, and its doctrinal focus on mysticism begin to make many Egyptian Jews long to adopt something similar.\n\nAbraham Maimonides (1204-1237), who was considered to be the most prominent leader and government representative of all Mamluk Jews, advocating reorganizing Jewish schools to be more like Sufi Hanaqas. Abraham would be the first to attempt borrow ideas and practices from Sufism in his Guide for the Perplexed. His heir Obadyah Maimonides(1228-1265) writes the \"Treatise of the Pool\" which is a mystical manual written in Arabic and filled with Sufi technical terms. In the book Obadyah lays out how one may obtain union with the unintelligible world showing his full adherence and advocacy of mysticism. He also began to reform practices advocating for celibacy and Halwa, solitary meditation, to better tune yourself to the spiritual plane. These were imitations of long held Sufi practices. In fact, he would often portrayed Jewish patriarchs such as Moses and Issac as hermit who relied on isolated meditation to remain in touch with God. The Maimonides dynasty would essentially spark a new movement amongst Egyptian Jews and thus the Pietist movement was formed.\n\nPeitism gained a huge following, mainly amongst the Jewish elite, and it would continue to gain momentum until the end of the Maimonides dynasty in the 15th Century. Additionally forced conversions in Yemen, Crusader and Almohad massacres in North Africa, and the collapse of Islamic Andalusia forced large number of Jews to resettle in Egypt many of whom would join the Pietist movement enthusiastically.  This enthusiasm may have been largely practical as the adoption of Sufi ideas did much to ingratiate the Mamluk Jewish community with their Muslim overlords which may have appealed to many of these refugees, as some historians state that the Maimonides dynasty itself originated from Al Andalus and resettled in Egypt.\n\nPietist would in some ways become indistinguishable from Sufism. They would clean their hands and feet before praying in the temple. They would face Jerusalem as they prayed. They frequently practiced daytime fasting and group meditation or muraqaba. \n\nThere was vehement opposition to the revisionism of Pietism just as there was with Hasidism. In fact opposition was so strong there are records of Jews reporting fellow Jews to Muslim authorities on the ground that they were practicing Islamic heresy. David Maimonides brother of Obadyah and his heir was eventually exiled to Palestine at the behest of other leaders in the Jewish community. Eventually Pietism fell out of favor in Egypt as its leaders were exiled and Jewish immigration into Egypt slowed. \n\nPer Fenton, the influence of Sufism is still present in many Kabbalist rituals and some of the manuscripts authored under the Maimonides Dynasty are still read and revered in Kabbalist circles.\n\nOn January 22, 1517, the Ottoman sultan, Selim I, defeated Tuman Bey, the last of the Mamelukes. He made radical changes in the governance of the Jewish community, abolishing the office of nagid, making each community independent, and placing David ibn Abi Zimra, at the head of that of Cairo. He also appointed Abraham de Castro to be master of the mint. It was during the reign of Salim's successor, Suleiman I, that Aḥmad Pasha, Viceroy of Egypt, revenged himself upon the Jews because De Castro had revealed (1524) to the sultan his designs for independence (see Aḥmad Pasha; Abraham de Castro). The \"Cairo Purim,\" in commemoration of their escape, is still celebrated on Adar 28.\n\nToward the end of the 16th century, Talmudic studies in Egypt were greatly fostered by Bezaleel Ashkenazi, author of the \"Shiṭṭah Meḳubbeẓet.\" Among his pupils were Isaac Luria, who as a young man had gone to Egypt to visit a rich uncle, the tax-farmer Mordecai Francis (Azulai, \"Shem ha-Gedolim,\" No. 332); and Abraham Monson (1594). Ishmael Kohen Tanuji finished his \"Sefer ha-Zikkaron\" in Egypt in 1543. Joseph ben Moses di Trani was in Egypt for a time (Frumkin, l.c. p. 69), as well as Ḥayyim Vital Aaron ibn Ḥayyim, the Biblical and Talmudical commentator (1609; Frumkin, l.c. pp. 71, 72). Of Isaac Luria's pupils, a Joseph Ṭabul is mentioned, whose son Jacob, a prominent man, was put to death by the authorities.\n\nAccording to Manasseh b. Israel (1656), \"The viceroy of Egypt has always at his side a Jew with the title 'zaraf bashi,' or 'treasurer,' who gathers the taxes of the land. At present Abraham Alkula holds the position.\" He was succeeded by Raphael Joseph Tshelebi, the rich friend and protector of Shabbatai Zevi. Shabbetai was twice in Cairo, the second time in 1660. It was there that he married the ill-famed Sarah, who had been brought from Leghorn (Livorno). The Shabbethaian movement naturally created a great stir in Egypt. It was in Cairo that Miguel (Abraham) Cardoso, the Shabbethaian prophet and physician, settled (1703), becoming physician to the pasha Kara Mohammed. In 1641 Samuel b. David, Karaite, visited Egypt. The account of his journey (G. i. 1) supplies special information in regard to his fellow sectaries. He describes three synagogues of the Rabbinites at Alexandria, and two at Rashid (G. i. 4). A second Karaite, Moses ben Elijah ha-Levi, has left a similar account of the year 1654; but it contains only a few points of special interest to the Karaites (ib).\n\nSambari mentions a severe trial which came upon the Jews, due to a certain \"ḳadi al-'asakir\" (=\"generalissimo,\" not a proper name) sent from Constantinople to Egypt, who robbed and oppressed them, and whose death was in a certain measure occasioned by the graveyard invocation of one Moses of Damwah. This may have occurred in the 17th century (S. 120, 21). David Conforte was dayyan in Egypt in 1671. Blood libels occurred at Alexandria in 1844, in 1881, and in January 1902. In consequence of the Damascus Affair, Moses Montefiore, Crémieux, and Salomon Munk visited Egypt in 1840; and the last two did much to raise the intellectual status of their Egyptian brethren by the founding, in connection with Rabbi Moses Joseph Algazi, of schools in Cairo. At the turn of the 20th century, a Jewish observer noted with 'true satisfaction that a great spirit of tolerance sustains the majority of our fellow Jews in Egypt, and it would be difficult to find a more liberal population or one more respectful of all religious beliefs.’\n\nAccording to the official census published in 1898 (i., xviii.), there were in Egypt 25,200 Jews in a total population of 9,734,405.\n\nDuring British rule, and under King Fuad I, Egypt was friendly towards its Jewish population although between 86% and 94% of Egyptian Jews did not possess Egyptian nationality whether they had been denied it or opted not to apply. Jews played important roles in the economy, and their population climbed to nearly 80,000 as Jewish refugees settled there in response to increasing persecution in Europe. Many Jewish families, such as the Qattawi family, had extensive economic relations with non-Jews.\n\nA sharp distinction had long existed between the respective Karaite and Rabbanite communities, among whom traditionally intermarriage was forbidden. They dwelt in Cairo in two contiguous areas, the former in the \"harat al-yahud al-qara’in\", and the latter in the adjacent \"harat al-yahud\" quarter. Notwithstanding the division, they often worked together and the younger educated generation pressed for improving relations between the two.\n\nIndividual Jews played an important role in Egyptian nationalism. René Qattawi, leader of the Cairo Sephardi community, endorsed the creation in 1935 of the Association of Egyptian Jewish Youth, with its slogan: 'Egypt is our homeland, Arabic is our language.' Qattawi strongly opposed political Zionism and wrote a note on 'The Jewish Question' to the World Jewish Congress in 1943 in which he argued that Palestine would be unable to absorb Europe's Jewish refugees.\nNevertheless, various wings of the Zionist movement had representatives in Egypt. Karaite Jewish scholar (1866–1956) was both an Egyptian nationalist and a passionate Zionist. His poem, 'My Homeland Egypt, Place of my Birth', expresses loyalty to Egypt, while his book, \"al-Qudsiyyat\" (Jerusalemica, 1923), defends the right of the Jews to a State. \"al-Qudsiyyat\" is perhaps the most eloquent defense of Zionism in the Arabic language. Mourad Farag was also one of the coauthors of Egypt's first Constitution in 1923.\n\nAnother famous Egyptian Jew of this period was Yaqub Sanu, who became a patriotic Egyptian nationalist advocating the removal of the British. He edited the nationalist publication Abu Naddara 'Azra from exile. This was one of the first magazines written in Egyptian Arabic, and mostly consisted of satire, poking fun at the British as well as the ruling Muhammad Ali dynasty, seen as puppets of the British. Another was Henri Curiel, who founded 'The Egyptian Movement for National Liberation' in 1943, an organization that was to form the core of the Egyptian Communist party. Curiel was later to play an important role in establishing early informal contacts between the PLO and Israel.\n\nIn 1937, the Egyptian government annulled the Capitulations, which gave foreign nationals a virtual status of exterritoriality: the minority groups affected were mainly from Syria, Greece, and Italy, ethnic Armenians, and some Jews who were nationals of other countries. The foreign nationals‘ immunity from taxation (\"mutamassir\") had given the minority groups trading within Egypt highly favourable advantages. Many European Jews used Egyptian banks as a vehicle for transferring money from central Europe, not least those Jews escaping the Fascist regimes. In addition to this, many Jewish people living in Egypt were known to possess foreign citizenship, while those possessing Egyptian citizenship often had extensive ties to European countries.\n\nThe impact of the well-publicized Arab-Jewish clash in Palestine from 1936 to 1939, together with the rise of Nazi Germany, also began to affect the Jewish relations with Egyptian society, despite the fact that the number of active Zionists in their ranks was small. The rise of local militant nationalistic societies like \"Young Egypt\" and the \"Society of Muslim Brothers\", who were sympathetic to the various models evinced by the Axis Powers in Europe, and organized themselves along similar lines, were also increasingly antagonistic to Jews. Groups including the Muslim Brotherhood circulated reports in Egyptian mosques and factories claiming that Jews and the British were destroying holy places in Jerusalem, as well as sending other false reports stating that hundreds of Arab women and children were being killed. Much of the anti-Semitism of the 1930s and 1940s was fueled by a close association between Hitler's new regime in Germany and anti-imperialist Arab powers. One of these Arab authorities was Haj Amin al-Husseini, who was influential in securing Nazi funds that were appropriated to the Muslim Brotherhood for the operation of a printing press for the distribution of thousands of Anti-Semitic propaganda pamphlets.\n\nBy the 1940s, the situation worsened. Sporadic pogroms took place in 1942 onwards. The Jewish quarter of Cairo was severely damaged in the 1945 Cairo pogrom. As the Partition of Palestine and the founding of Israel drew closer, hostility towards the Egyptian Jews strengthened, fed also by press attacks on all foreigners accompanying the rising ethnocentric nationalism of the age. In 1947, the Company Laws set quotas for employing Egyptian nationals in incorporated firms, requiring that 75% of salaried employees, and 90% of all workers, must be Egyptian. As Jews were denied citizenship as a rule, this constrained Jewish and foreign-owned entrepreneurs to reduce recruitment for employment positions from their own ranks. The law also required that just over half of the paid-up capital of joint stock companies be Egyptian.\n\nThe Egyptian Prime Minister Nuqrashi told the British ambassador:\n“All Jews were potential Zionists [and] ...anyhow all Zionists were Communists\". On 24 November 1947, the head of the Egyptian delegation to the UN General Assembly, Muhammad Hussein Heykal Pasha, said that “the lives of 1,000,000 Jews in Moslem countries would be jeopardized by the establishment of a Jewish state.\" On 24 November 1947, Dr Heykal Pasha said: \"if the U.N. decide to amputate a part of Palestine in order to establish a Jewish state... Jewish blood will necessarily be shed elsewhere in the Arab world… to place in certain and serious danger a million Jews. Mahmud Bey Fawzi (Egypt) said: \"Imposed partition was sure to result in bloodshed in Palestine and in the rest of the Arab world\".\n\nAfter the foundation of Israel in 1948, and the subsequent 1948 Arab–Israeli War, in which Egypt participated, difficulties multiplied for Egyptian Jews, who then numbered 75,000. That year, bombings of Jewish areas killed 70 Jews and wounded nearly 200, while riots claimed many more lives. During the Arab-Israeli war, the famous Cicurel department store near Cairo's Opera Square was firebombed. The government helped with funds to rebuild it, but it was again burnt down in 1952, and eventually passed into Egyptian control. As a result, many Egyptian Jews emigrated abroad. By 1950, nearly 40% of Egypt's Jewish population had emigrated. About 14,000 of them went to Israel, and the rest to other countries.\n\nThe 1954 Lavon Affair was an Israeli sabotage operation designed to discredit and overthrow the then Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser and to end secret negotiations with Egypt being pursued by then Israeli prime minister Moshe Sharett, who did not know of the operation. Sharett did not learn the truth until after he had denounced the charges by the Egyptian government in a speech in the Knesset as a blood libel, which caused him to feel deep humiliation that he had lied to the world, and was one factor in Sharett's resignation as prime minister. The operation blew up Western targets (without causing any deaths), led to deeper distrust of Jews—key agents in the operation had been recruited from the Egyptian Jewish community—and led to sharply increased emigration of Jews from Egypt. In his summing up statement Fu’ad al-Digwi, the prosecutor at the trial of captured operatives, repeated the official government stance: \"The Jews of Egypt are living among us and are sons of Egypt. Egypt makes no difference between its sons whether Moslems, Christians, or Jews. These defendants happen to be Jews who reside in Egypt, but we are trying them because they committed crimes against Egypt, although they are Egypt's sons.\"\n\nTwo members of the ring, Dr. Moussa Marzouk and Shmuel Azzar, were sentenced to death (six members of Marzouk's extended family had been killed in the 1948 massacres, for which no arrests had been made). In 1953, a cousin of Marzouk, Kamal Massuda, was killed, and the authorities did not make arrests. Other members of the sabotage rings had families who lost their livelihood after the 1947 Company Laws, which severely restricted the right to work and to own companies of non-Egyptian citizens (Jews were not in general allowed citizenship), were implemented.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of trilateral invasion on 23 November 1956 by Britain, France, and Israel (known as the Suez Crisis), a proclamation was issued stating that 'all Jews are Zionists and enemies of the state', and it promised that they would be soon expelled. Some 25,000 Jews, almost half of the Jewish community left for Israel, Europe, the United States, and South America, after being forced to sign declarations that they were leaving voluntarily, and agreed with the confiscation of their assets. Some 1,000 more Jews were imprisoned. Similar measures were enacted against British and French nationals in retaliation for the invasion. In Joel Beinin's summary: \"Between 1919 and 1956, the entire Egyptian Jewish community, like the Cicurel firm, was transformed from a national asset into a fifth column.\" After 1956, prominent families, like the Qattawis, were left with only a fraction of the social clout they had once enjoyed, if they could remain in Egypt at all. Ironically Jews like Rene Qattawi were in full support of establishing an Arab-Egyptian nationalism, and were opposed to the rise of Zionism and the establishment of the State of Israel. Nonetheless, even this social elite of the Jewish population was not believed to have any place in the new Egyptian regime.\n\nAmong those Jews deported, Dr. Raymond F. Schinazi who was born in Alexandria left Egypt with his family to an Italian refugee camp at the age of thirteen. Later Schinazi, working for Gilead Sciences, agreed to provide Egypt with the drug Sovaldi at US$300, 1% of its market price. In 2014 about 12 million Egyptians were infected with hepatitis C.\n\nUN High Commissioner for Refugees Auguste Lindt stated in his Report to the UNREF Executive Committee's Fourth Session (Geneva 29 January to 4 February 1957) “Another emergency problem is now arising: that of refugees from Egypt. There is no doubt in my mind that those refugees from Egypt who are not able, or not willing, to avail themselves of the protection of the Government of their nationality fall under the mandate of my office.”\n\nThe last chief Rabbi of Egypt was Haim Moussa Douek, who served from 1960 until he left Egypt in 1972. After the Six-Day War in 1967, more confiscations took place. Rami Mangoubi, who lived in Cairo at the time, said that nearly all Egyptian Jewish men between the ages of 17 and 60 were either thrown out of the country immediately, or taken to the detention centers of Abou Za'abal and Tura, where they were incarcerated and tortured for more than three years. The eventual result was the almost complete disappearance of the 3,000-year-old Jewish community in Egypt; the vast majority of Jews left the country. Most Egyptian Jews fled to Israel (35,000), Brazil (15,000), France (10,000), the US (9,000) and Argentina (9,000). A letter published by the Jerusalem Post from Dr. E. Jahn, of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees stated: “I refer to our recent discussion concerning Jews from Middle Eastern and North African countries in consequence of recent events. I am now able to inform you that such persons may be considered prima facie within the mandate of this Office.”\n\nAccording to a 2009 report by the Anti-Defamation League, anti-semitic and anti-Israel sentiments continued to run high. Israel and Zionism were frequently associated with conspiracy theories of subverting and weakening the state. The last Jewish wedding in Egypt took place in 1984.\n\nThe Jewish population of Egypt was estimated at less than 200 in 2007, less than 40 in 2014, and as of 2017, is estimated at 18 (6 in Cairo, 12 in Alexandria). In 2018 the estimated Jewish population was 100 Marriage restriction has caused many members to convert to other religions, mainly Jewish women who convert to Islam, due to being married to Egyptian Muslim men. Because a Jewish man cannot marry an Egyptian Muslim woman, but an Egyptian Muslim man may marry a Jewish woman, the community has lost many male members who are no longer Jewish on official documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The name comes from the Gaelic word Sheiling or shed, a stone-built place of shelter used during the summer months. It is in the traditional county of Sutherland, now part of the Highland council area; the 2011 Census classified Scourie as 'Very remote rural' with an adult population of 132.\n\nUntil the 19th century, Clan Mackay was the predominant family in the area with a junior branch of the family owning Scourie itself; in 1640, it was the birthplace of Hugh Mackay, a Scottish general who settled in the Netherlands and commanded the forces of William III at Killiecrankie in July 1689. The last of the Mackays' Scottish estates including Scourie were sold in 1829, although the name is still common in the area.\n\nThe nearby island of Handa is a nature reserve and the site of a large seabird colony, including puffins, skuas, guillemots and razorbills. The Scourie estate is owned by Dr Jean Balfour. The palm trees in the grounds of Scourie House next to the harbour are claimed to be the most northerly specimens in the world not grown in artificial conditions. However, this is a popular misconception. The \"palms\" in the grounds are actually \"Cordyline australis\", a native New Zealand tree which is found in lowland and montane areas. In the UK it is commonly referred to as \"Torbay palm\" or \"Cornwall palm\".\n\nBeing on the popular North Coast 500 (NC500) scenic route, the village has accommodation for tourists in several small hotels, bed and breakfasts and a campsite. Fishing is a popular attraction due to the large number of freshwater lochs in the remote area.\n\nScourie plays host to the home matches of shinty team, Kinlochbervie Camanachd Club\n\n"}

A second-generation wrestler, the stepson of 1950s Texas wrestler Frankie Hill Murdoch, he grew up with fellow second-generation wrestlers Dory Funk Jr. and Terry Funk, watching their fathers wrestle all around Texas. Frank Murdoch held the NWA Southwest Junior Heavyweight Championship three times in his career. Dick attended Caprock High School, where he took part in amateur wrestling. \n\nMurdoch started wrestling in 1965 as \"Ron Carson\" in a tag team with Don Carson. He soon started wrestling under his real name. In 1968, he formed a tag team that would continue throughout the early 1970s with Dusty Rhodes called The Texas Outlaws, and during that time he adopted his Dick Murdoch name. After splitting with Rhodes, he wrestled for several territories within the National Wrestling Alliance, most famously Florida Championship Wrestling and also wrestled in Mid-South Wrestling. Also, during that time, Murdoch would partially wrestle with All Japan Pro-Wrestling, feuding with Giant Baba, The Destroyer, Genichiro Tenryu and Jumbo Tsuruta. His most famous matches there were a Two Out Of Three Falls match against Harley Race for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on May 8, 1979, which ended in a draw (1–1) after time limit expired, and the other one also being a Two Out Of Three Falls against Jumbo Tsuruta for the NWA United National Championship on March 5, 1980, with Tsuruta defeating Murdoch (2–1). Even though Murdoch wrestled there for so long, he didn't get too much exposure like his fellow foreigners would, and wrestled his last match on March 3, 1981 in a tag team match involving him and Mario Milano losing to Jumbo Tsuruta and Tiger Toguchi.\n\nMurdoch's most noted work as a wrestler came in Mid-South Wrestling in the early 1980s, where he teamed with Junkyard Dog. The pair was the most popular champions in the region, attracting the hardcore, working class white fans with his \"Captain Redneck\" persona and JYD drawing the support of the black fan base. Their feud with the Fabulous Freebirds was perhaps Mid-South's most compelling storyline.\n\nIn 1984, Murdoch went to the World Wrestling Federation and formed a tag team with Adrian Adonis called \"North-South Connection\", since Adrian was a New York (North) native while Dick was a Texas (South) native. Both men were involved in a series of vignettes alongside Mean Gene Okerlund, with both men visiting each other's hometowns, not being used with each other's urban and country lifestyles. They captured the World Tag Team Titles, defending them against Jack and Jerry Brisco, Barry Windham and Mike Rotunda, The Wild Samoans, Paul Roma and Salvatore Bellomo, and many other teams. He left the WWF in 1985 after dropping the tag-team title to The U.S. Express for Mid-South, while Adonis left to wrestle in Japan.\n\nIn 1981, Murdoch started what truly would be his international exposure, by wrestling for New Japan Pro-Wrestling. He entered the MSG Tag League of that year, teaming with fellow Texan Stan Hansen, with the team finishing 3rd place with 36 points, scoring victories over teams such as El Canek and Super Maquina, Riki Choshu and Yoshiaki Yatsu, Seiji Sakaguchi and Kengo Kimura and Antonio Inoki and Tatsumi Fujinami. \n\nIn 1982, Murdoch returned for the MSG League 1982 tournament, finishing 4th place with 41 points, scoring victories over wrestlers like The Iron Sheik, Seiji Sakaguchi, Tatsumi Fujinami, Don Muraco and Tiger Toguchi. He also engaged in a few encounters with Hulk Hogan, which ended in double count-out or with Murdoch being disqualified. He once again entered the MSG Tag League, this time with the Masked Superstar with the team finishing 4th place with 21 points, scoring victories over teams such as El Canek and Perro Aguayo, Tiger Toguchi and Killer Khan and Dino Bravo and Murdoch's future tag team partner Adrian Adonis.\n\nIn 1983, he mainly feuded with Riki Choshu's Ishin Gundan, mainly wrestling Choshu, Killer Khan, Animal Hamaguchi and Yoshiaki Yatsu. He also teamed with Paul Orndorff and Adrian Adonis against the Gundan and a few New Japan's loyalists such as Osamu Kido, Seiji Sakaguchi and Kengo Kimura. He would once again enter the MSG Tag League of that year, this time teaming with Adonis, with the team reaching the finals with 27.5 points, in a losing effort against the winners Antonio Inoki and Hulk Hogan. A year later, after his team with Adonis officialized while both were in the WWF, they started regularly to team up against New Japan's top tag-team contenders and having iconic encounters against Inoki, Fujinami, Andre The Giant, Gerry Morow, Strong Machines (#1 and #2) and other top threats. Both men individually entered the MSG League, in which Murdoch finished 5th place with 30 points, defeating Ken Patera, Big John Quinn, Otto Wanz and even his own partner Adonis. The team of Murdoch and Adonis entered the MSG Tag League of that year, once again reaching the finals with 23 points, but again coming up short against the winners Inoki and Fujinami.\n\nIn 1985, Murdoch entered the IWGP League, a single-elimination system-styled tournament, defeating Kengo Kimura in the first round, advancing to the quarter-finals in which he defeated Seiji Sakaguchi, until losing to Andre The Giant in the semifinals. He and Adonis were wrestling in Japan while both were WWF Tag Team Champions, at one point successfully defending both belts against Kengo Kimura and Tatsumi Fujinami. After both men left the WWF, they wrestled full-time with New Japan Pro-Wrestling, once competing for the vacated WWF International Tag Team Championship against the team they defended their national belts, Kimura and Fujinami, in a losing effort. They tried to gain them in a rematch, but both men came up short. After failing to win the belts, Murdoch and Adonis partied ways and each man went singles competition. Murdoch would resume his singles career by feuding with Inoki and Fujinami, and also having bloody encounters with Abdullah The Butcher and Bruiser Brody. He reunited with the Masked Superstar to compete in the IWGP Tag Team League of that year, with both men finishing 4th place with 19 points, defeating the Kelly Twins (Mike and Pat), Dos Caras and El Canek, and Kendo Nagasaki and Mr. Pogo. In 1986, Murdoch started to feud with the new breed of wrestlers, such as Keiji Mutoh, Shinya Hashimoto, Tatsutoshi Goto and UWF crusaders Akira Maeda, Nobuhiko Takada, as well as veterans like Osamu Kido and Yoshiaki Fujiwara. Murdoch participated in the IWGP League of that year, wrestling his way to the finals, where he lost to Inoki. Later, he and Masked Superstar took another shot at the IWGP Tag Team League tournament, reaching the semifinals where they lost to Akira Maeda and Osamu Kido. \n\nThe following year saw Murdoch not having much exposure, as he was wrestling often in tag team action alongside younger foreign wrestlers, such as Scott Hall, Owen Hart, Matt Borne and The Cuban Assassin. Later, he found an uncommon tag team partnership with Inoki as both men competed in the Japan Cup Tag Team League together. They wrestled their way to the finals, where both men lost to Kengo Kimura and Tatsumi Fujinami.\n\nIn 1988, Adrian Adonis returned to NJPW, immediately reuniting with Murdoch, reforming their tag team, and later forming a trio with Owen Hart. Murdoch and Adonis' only title match occurred on June 23, where they unsuccessfully faced reigning IWGP Tag Team Champions Masa Saito and Riki Choshu. The duo teamed together until Adonis' death in July 4th, and after that date, Murdoch would not return to Japan for 5 months. In November 1988, Murdoch returned to NJPW, taking part into the Japan Cup Tag Team Elimination League, a round-robin tournament of trios consisting of six-man tag team elimination matches. Murdoch teamed up with Scott Hall and Bob Orton Jr., wrestling their first tournament match on November 17, defeating the six-man combination of Antonio Inoki, Riki Choshu and Kantaro Hoshino, with Murdoch last eliminating Inoki with Orton's assistance. They suffered their first loss at the hands of Masa Saito, Tatsutoshi Goto and Seiji Sakaguchi, but quickly rebounded by defeating Super Strong Machine, The Tiger and The Jaguar, with Murdoch last eliminating the Strong Machine. They later defeated Kengo Kimura, Yoshiaki Fujiwara and Osamu Kido, even though Murdoch got eliminated by Kimura during the match, his team got the win after Orton last eliminated Fujiwara. Their winning streak continued when they defeated George Takano, Steve Armstrong and Tracy Smothers, after Murdoch last eliminated Takano. However, they suffered another loss at the hands of Tatsumi Fujinami, Shinya Hashimoto and Masahiro Chono, but once again quickly rebounded by defeating Hiro Saito, Shiro Koshinaka and Kuniaki Kobayashi, after Murdoch eliminated Kobayashi and Saito. After defeating Buzz Sawyer, Manny Fernandez and Kendo Nagasaki by forfeit, they once again faced the Saito, Sakaguchi and Goto combination. In what would seemed to be another loss after Hall and Orton were the two first eliminated, Murdoch single handedly eliminated Sakaguchi and Saito, before finally making quick work out of Goto, eliminating him and avenging their loss. However the team couldn't reach the finals due to the two losses they suffered.\n\nThe year of 1989 saw Murdoch's last stand with New Japan, as he briefly returned in July, facing the likes of Shinya Hashimoto, Hiroshi Hase, Vladimir Berkovich, and Evgeny Artyukhin. His last match occurred on August 5, where he defeated Berkovich. Murdoch never wrestled for New Japan ever again after that year.\n\nHe briefly wrestled in Mid-South Wrestling again, before turning up in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions in 1986 as a babyface. He feuded with Ric Flair and attempted to win Flair's NWA World Title. He also teamed with Ron Garvin against Flair and the Four Horsemen. In early 1987, Murdoch turned heel and joined Ivan Koloff and Vladimir Petrov in their attempt to get Nikita Koloff and Dusty Rhodes. Then a NWA United States Tag Team Champion with Ivan, he injured Nikita's neck after a brain-buster suplex on the floor that summer, resulting in his (kayfabe) suspension for 30 days and the team being stripped of the title. He left the NWA and wrestled in the World Wrestling Council, before appearing in World Championship Wrestling as one half of the \"Hardliners,\" or \"Hardline Collection Agency,\" with Dick Slater in 1991. They feuded with Rick and Scott Steiner but could not win their title.\n\nMurdoch was the twenty-seventh entrant in the 1995 WWF Royal Rumble. He was eliminated by Henry O. Godwinn. That May, he wrestled Wahoo McDaniel in a black-and-white \"Legends Match\" at Slamboree. In March 1996, he wrestled Vampire Warrior and The Viking in Kuantan, Malaysia, then finished his career in the May 23 main event of a Pro Wrestling Fujiwara Gumi show in Tokyo, against Yoshiaki Fujiwara.\n\nMurdoch was married on September 21, 1966 in Potter County, Texas to Janice Hix. Together, they had one child before divorcing on October 1, 1973.\n\nMurdoch is the cousin of wrestler Killer Tim Brooks.\n\nOver the years, several within professional wrestling who knew Murdoch have said he was racist and was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. In a shoot interview, Bad News Brown accused him of being a member of the Klan. This was also mentioned by Tito Santana in his autobiography, \"Tales From The Ring\". Former \"WWE SmackDown\" head writer Alex Greenfield also related a story told to him by Dusty Rhodes about Murdoch driving him to a Klan party without telling him it was a KKK party beforehand. In 2014, former wrestling star Rocky Johnson, father of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, claimed Murdoch was a member of the Klan and that he once knocked him unconscious during a match stating during an interview, \"Because he was KKK and didn't like blacks, he kept kicking me hard and punching me. I said, 'you hit me one more time, I'm hitting you back.' He hit me, and I knocked him out.\" \n\nMurdoch appeared in four movies: \"The Wrestler\" (1974), \"Paradise Alley\" (1978), \"Grunt! The Wrestling Movie\" (1985), and \"Manhattan Merengue!\" (1995). He also appeared on an episode of \"Learning The Ropes\" and an episode of \"The Jerry Springer Show\".\n\nMurdoch was featured as a playable character in the 2007 video game \"Wrestle Kingdom 2\".\n\nMurdoch died of a heart attack on June 15, 1996, at the age of 49.\n\n\n"}

It can be either a passenger or cargo space.\n\nA tonneau cover in current automotive terminology is a hard or soft cover that spans the back of a pickup truck in order to protect the contents of the payload or improve aerodynamics. Tonneau covers come in a wide variety of styles that fold, retract or tilt open, and can generally be locked to secure the contents of the pickup truck bed. Tonneau covers are also used in the boating industry to cover and protect any open areas of a boat. Many of these covers are made from a waterproofed canvas material and are secured to the edges of the area to be protected with snaps.\n\nThe older, original tonneau covers were used to protect unoccupied passenger seats in a convertible or roadster, or the cargo bed in a pickup truck. Hard tonneau covers open by a hinging or folding mechanism while segmented or soft covers open by rolling up.\n\nTruck or car tonneau covers also conceal and/or cover cargo or personal belongings. When the cover is pulled out, it keeps items out of the sun and provides extra security by keeping personal items out of sight.\n\nTonneau covers are used in coupé utility cars and pickup trucks to cover and secure the cargo tray and come in a variety of styles.\n\nThe most common style is the roll-up tonneau made from cloth or vinyl, which uses a rib-like structure to support the fabric and keep it taut. A snap-based system is also used, but has become less common due to truck owners not wanting to install the snaps on their vehicle as they typically require drilling or permanent adhesive. Roll-up tonneaus are opened by rolling the cover up toward the cab of the truck. Hard roll-up tonneau covers are more firm than regular roll-up tonneau covers. They are made of a wall of individual aluminum slats, covered with soft vinyl. In the unrolled position, these aluminum slats form a hard aluminum shell, which not only covers the cargo inside the bed, but also may support loads up 400 pounds on top of it. \n\nAnother style of truck bed tonneau cover is a retractable unit, which is mounted at the front and sides of the bed and rolls up or retracts from the tailgate towards the cab. The retractable tonneau is typically made of vinyl, plastic or aluminum. Retractable tonneaus are more secure than soft tonneau covers, since they usually lock and are made from a harder composition, but they take more time to install and are designed for semi-permanent installation.\n\nFiberglass, hard plastic or aluminum tonneau covers are also common. Some may be painted to match the truck, are solid in construction, and can be locked. These covers are usually heavy and require gas struts to assist in opening and closing. They operate much like a vehicle's hood, typically opening from the tailgate end of the bed (back to front). Some have multiple compartments that open front to back, back to front, side to side, or even rise vertically. Fiberglass, hard plastic or aluminum tonneau covers are sometimes installed as a factory option on new vehicles.\n\nMany sellers claim that tonneau covers improve gas mileage because they make the truck more streamlined. However, air currents create a wake inside the pickup bed, which helps the aerodynamics. A tonneau cover interferes with this wake, and scientific tests have shown little to no improvement in mileage by using a tonneau cover traveling at less than . A similar effect is seen when the tailgate is down and the mileage goes down.\n\nA tonneau was originally an open rear passenger compartment, rounded like a barrel, on an automobile and, by extension, a body style incorporating such a compartment. The word is French, meaning 'cask' or barrel.\n\nEarly tonneaus normally had a rear-facing hinged door, but single and dual side doors were soon introduced. \n\nWhen the street was muddy or dirty the car could be backed up to the curb so tonneau passengers could exit directly onto the sidewalk.\n\nEarly open-bodied touring-type automobiles used tonneau covers to protect unoccupied rear seats. As early as the 1930s, lakes racers, searching for that extra competitive edge, pulled a page directly from early automobile construction and skinned the cockpits of their roadsters and streamliners with removable canvas. The skins covered gaping cockpits that would otherwise disturb airflow and create undue drag; as a result, tonneau-equipped cars ultimately went faster with a given amount of power.\n\nTonneau covers are available for open sports cars such as the Porsche Boxster, MG, Triumph, and Austin-Healey. These covers, often made of natural or artificial leather, cover the entire passenger compartment, and are zippered so the driver's seat can be uncovered while the rest of the interior remains covered. Tonneau covers may be used in lieu of hard or soft convertible tops.\n\nAs air courses over the windshield at speed, it creates turbulence as it cascades into and bounces out of the cockpit. This condition is called buffeting, and can be an annoyance to the vehicle's occupants. A tonneau cover reduces buffeting at all speeds. Heat produced by a heater leaves as that turbulence exchanges the cockpit's warmer air for cooler ambient air. A tonneau cover is capable of both retaining heat and shielding a driver from UV exposure.\n\"\"Tonneau case\"\" is used to describe a type of watch case, with rounded, bulging sides resembling a barrel (or cask).\n"}

{"id": "1935384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935384", "title": "Jean Absil", "text": "Jean Absil\n\nJean Absil (23 October 1893 – 2 February 1974) was a Belgian composer, organist, and professor at the Brussels Conservatoire.\n\nAbsil was born in Bonsecours, Hainaut, Belgium. His teacher there was Alphonse Oeyen, organist at the basilica of Bonsecours. From 1913 he studied organ and harmony at the Brussels Conservatoire, but upon graduating, decided to concentrate on composition instead.\n\nIn 1922 Absil won the Belgian Prix de Rome and in 1934 the Prix Rubens, which allowed him to travel to Paris. Here, he met fellow contemporary composers Ibert, Milhaud, and Honegger. Absil gained international prominence with the premiere of his first piano concerto (op. 30), composed for the 1938 Queen Elizabeth Competition for Piano (Ysaye), for which it was the compulsory piece for all finalists. Only one of those, Moura Lympany, who won second prize (after Emil Gilels), performed the piece entirely from memory mistake free.\n\nFrom 1930 onwards, Absil taught harmony at the Brussels Conservatoire, becoming a professor of counterpoint there six years later. Amongst his Conservatoire pupils was Paul Danblon. He also taught at Chapelle Musicale Reine Elisabeth and the Etterbeek Music School. During this period also, he was, with Charles Leirens, the first editor of the \"Revue Internationale de Musique\" (1936–1952). From 1955 he served as a member of Belgium's Royal Academy. He died in Brussels at the age of 80.\n\nInitially, Absil was influenced by the late Romantic school, particularly Wagner and Richard Strauss. Around the time he made his trip to Paris in 1934, he began to adopt a more modern style. This included the use of polyphony and polymodal structures, influenced by contemporary composers such as Milhaud and Schoenberg.\n\nThe ear never suffers from an impression of tonal insecurity when listening to Absil's music: while it is no longer possible to find a reference to the classical major or minor tonalities, the composer invents new modes, which he replaces for each piece. From these modes emerge chords which, even if they are different from the classical ones, also have an expressive sense (tension or resolution). Absil never practised a real atonality: the apparent tonal independence of the voices always resolves itself into a unique tonality.\n\nUnusually prolific from his 20s to his late 70s, Absil concentrated especially on writing piano works; he was himself a skilled pianist. These works include \"Ballade\", op. 129, for solo piano (which is played with the left hand only) as well as \"3 Pièces\" (played with the right one only). Among his conventionally two-handed piano compositions are three sonatinas (written in 1937, 1939, and 1965 respectively) and two \"Grand Suites\". The \"Grand Suites\" (Op.110, composed in 1965) served as a tribute to Frédéric Chopin. In 1946, he composed another work, \"Hommage à Schumann\" and in 1957 the \"Passacaglia in Memoriam Alban Berg\", both of them for piano.

{"id": "1935385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935385", "title": "Adverbial phrase", "text": "Adverbial phrase\n\nIn linguistics, an adverbial phrase (\"AdvP\") is a multi-word expression operating adverbially: its syntactic function is to modify other expressions, including verbs, adjectives, adverbs, adverbials, and sentences. Adverbial phrases can be divided into two types: complement adverbs and modifier adverbs. For example, in the sentence \"She sang very well\", the expression \"very well\" is an adverbial phrase, as it modifies the verb \"to sing\". More specifically, the adverbial phrase \"very well\" contains two adverbials, \"very\" and \"well\": while \"well\" modifies the verb to convey information about the manner of singing (for example, \"She sang well\" versus \"She sang badly\"), \"very\" is a degree modifier that conveys information about the degree to which the action of singing well was accomplished (for example, \"Not only did she sing well, she sang very well\").\n\nThe following examples illustrate some of the most common types of adverbial phrases. All adverbial phrases appear in bold; when relevant, the head of each adverbial phrase appears in square brackets.\n\nThe heads of each of the following adverbial phrases are degree adverbials (written \"Deg\" in syntactic trees). Degree adverbials modify adjacent adverbs (that is, an adverb that is lower in the syntactic tree than the degree adverbial). Degree adverbials are commonly used in English to convey the intensity, degree, or focusing of an adjacent adverb. In most cases, a degree adverbial is used to modify an adverb in an adverbial phrase: for example, in (1) the degree adverbial \"very\" modifies the adverb \"quickly\"; in (2) the degree adverbial \"extremely\" modifies the adverb \"hard\"; in (3) the degree adverbial \"really\" modifies the adverb \"well\"; and in (4), the degree adverbial \"so\" modifies the adverb \"soon\".\n\nModifier adverbial phrases combine with a sentence, and the removal of the adverbial phrase yields a well-formed sentence. For example, in (5) the modifier adverbial phrase \"in an hour\" can be removed, and the sentence remains well-formed (e.g., \"I'll go to bed\"); in (6) the modifier AdvP \"three hours late\" can be omitted, and the sentence remains well-formed (e.g., \"We arrived\"); and in (7), the modifier AdvP \"later in the day\" can be omitted, and the sentence remains well-formed (e.g. \"The situation had resolved\"). Just as adjective phrases function attributively to give additional information about an adjacent noun, the modifier adverbial phrases illustrated in (5) to (7) function as secondary predicates that give additional temporal information about the sentence.\n\nAs mentioned above, complement adverbial phrases are much less common than their modifier counterparts. Adverbial phrases functioning as complements usually arise when an adverb licenses a complement as a selectional requirement. Nearly all of these complements license an adjoining prepositional phrase. Below are a few examples of complement adverbial phrases.\n\nThe following sentences illustrate the difference between adverbs, adverbial phrases, and adverbial clauses. \nIn the first example, \"soon\" is an adverb (as distinct from a noun or a verb), which is a type of adverbial. In the second sentence, the modifier \"in an hour\" has the same syntactic function (that is, to act adverbially and modify the base of the sentence \"I'll go to bed\"), though it does not contain an adverb. This modifier consists of a preposition and a determiner phrase, and functions as an adverbial, thus making it an adverbial phrase. In the third example, we see a whole clause functioning as an adverbial; it is termed an adverbial clause.\n\nFunctionally, the term adverbial refers to all structures that can take the position of an adverb on a phrase structure level.Adverbs modify the functional categories that occur in a sentence and may also be treated as predicates which are functionally open and require one or more arguments to be satisfied. It has been argued that the distribution of adverbs is largely conditioned by their lexical nature or thematic properties.\n\nMain classes of adverbials are used to distinguish the functional properties of the adverbs within the phrase. Each class has subcategories, that refer more specifically to the syntactic and semantic properties of the adverbial. There is no distinct terminology for these classes used universally in literature, though adverbials are often classified into their functional categories. The major classes of adverbials are adjunct, disjunct and conjunct.\nThe class of subjunct is usually placed within adjunct class as it is difficult to distinguish between the two.\n\nThe subcategories for adverbials have more universally used terminology and often refer to the nature of the adverb within each phrase. Most literature focuses on the specific categories of adjunct adverbials.\n\nAdjunct adverbials are the most often discussed class of adverbials, when discussing distribution in English. Complement adverbials are also seen to display similar attributes as adjuncts. Distinguishing between these is a matter of the overt realization of the phrase and is discussed below. The most recognizable subcategories for adjunct adverbials would be.:\n\nConjunct adverbials, sometimes called linking adverbials, are used to connect clauses together and surface in a clause-initial position in English.\n\nDisjunct adverbials, also referred to as modal adverbials, have subcategories which relay a speakers interpretation of what appears lower in the clause.\n\nSubjunct adverbials are not often discussed as a class of its own in literature. As the distinction of these subcategories as subjunctive depend on the role the adverbial takes within the phrase, a subordinate role, and when not in this structure will be in the adjunct class.\n\nAdverbials can be adjuncts, complements, conjuncts, or disjuncts. Most commonly, adverbial phrases are either complements or adjuncts. Adjunct adverbial phrases provide additional information and are part of the structure of the clause, but are optional. Complements are elements of an utterance that complete the meaning of the noun or sentence in which it is being used. Unlike adjuncts, they are necessary to complete the meaning of a given sentence. Adverbial complement is the term used to identify an adverbial phrase that is necessary to the meaning of the verb or utterance. Adverbial complements always appear after the verb that they modify. If the verb is intransitive, the complement will appear directly after the verb; if the verb is transitive, the complement will appear after the verb's direct object.\n\nA test to identify whether or not an adverbial phrase is a complement or adjunct is to remove the phrase in question from the sentence. If the sentence no longer makes sense or if its meaning is altered heavily, then the adverbial element is a complement. If the meaning is still intact, it is an adjunct.\nOne phenomenon occurring frequently in sentences that involve adverbial phrases is adverbial fronting, where the adverbial phrase moves to the front of a sentence. \n\nLiliane Haegeman has done considerable work on both this phenomenon, as well as comparing the movement of adverbial phrases to this syntactic position to typical movement and topicalization of arguments. Haegeman mentions that there is a difference between fronted adjuncts (in this case, adverbial phrases) and topicalized arguments. Adverbial phrases behave as adjuncts, and that serves as particularly useful in discussions regarding adverbial phrases and their movement, as well as their integration into syntactic structure.\n\nThere are three primary reasons, according to Haegeman, why topicalized arguments and fronted adjuncts differ.\n\n1. Fronted arguments block subject extraction, while fronted adjuncts do not. \nThis is displayed in the following examples, which are given in \"Notes on Long Adverbial Fronting in English and the Left Periphery\":\n\n\n2. Topicalized arguments determine island effects on extraction, while fronted adjuncts do not. What this means is that arguments cannot be extracted from an island and thereby fronted, whereas adjuncts, in this case adverbial phrases, can be extracted and fronted.\n\n3. English fronted arguments are restricted to root clauses, while adjuncts are not. \nIn regards to main and embedded clauses, topicalization of arguments cannot occur from an embedded to a root clause. However, adjuncts are free to make this movement and are not restricted by embedded clauses.\n\nThis third distinction between topicalized arguments and fronted adjuncts lends itself well to an explanation of long and short adverb fronting. Short adverb fronting is fronting of an adjunct such as an adverb within one clause, while long adverb fronting involves movement of an adjunct from a position in the embedded clause to a position in the root clause.\n\nAccording to Haegeman, instances of long adverb fronting appear to behave like fronted arguments, adhering to the three distinctions not typically expected of adjuncts such as adverbial phrases. This is shown, Haegeman argues, as extracted adjuncts behave similarly to topicalized arguments in that long adjunct fronting blocks subject extraction, while short adjunct fronting does not. Additionally, in long adjunct fronting, long adjunct fronting means that the constituent which moves may change the meaning of the sentence or make it ungrammatical.\n\n\nIt has also been proposed that temporal adverbial clauses, giving \"when\" information about time, can be derived from wh-movement in a sentence and be fronted in a similar manner. Typically, this is movement towards the left periphery, to the left of the subject position.\n\n\nPreviously discussed short fronting plays a role in the movement of temporal adverbial clauses. According to Haegeman's movement approach, short movement is commonly found in this temporal adverbial movement; however, long adverbial movement is also found in regards to temporal adverbial phrases using \"when\".\n\nAdverbial phrases are different across languages. French is a case in point. Like English, adverb phrases are the parts of a sentence that add circumstantial information. French often requires using adverbial phrases where English is satisfied with a simple adverb.\n\nFor example, where English uses just one adverb, French requires a full adverbial phrase:\n\n\nPlacements of adverbs in adverbial phrases is usually determined by the category of adverbs. In English, placement of adverbs can sometimes be arbitrary, where some adverbs may be found in front or after the verb or even at the beginning of the sentence, while French adverbs have much stricter rules and can be difficult.\n\nWhen a French adverb modifies a verb, it is placed after the conjugated verb, example:\n\nWhen an adverb modifies an adjective or another adverb, it is placed in front of the \nword it is modifying, for example:\n\nThere is a contrast between verb–adverbial order in French and adverbial–verb order in English. Adverbial expressions are formed in French, by combining prepositions with nouns (or noun phrases), adjectives (adjective + a noun), adverbs, or a series of words.\n\nWhile movement is slightly different from English, suffixation is similar. Most French words that end in -ment is an adverb, and the majority of the time its English equivalent ends in -ly: généralement – generally.\nIn a brief overview on how adverbs are used in the overall phrase structure, in French there is an expansion in the word due to a derivation adjective adjective-to-adverb conversion process, namely, -ment suffixation. For example:\n\nSimilarly, in English, words have the -ly suffication added at the end of adverbs in adverbial phrases. For example:\n\nHowever, this process of adding suffixation at the end of the adverbial word in French, is not as productive as -ly suffixation in English, and some adjectives are incompatible with it. For example, the adverb 'interesting' would become ungrammatical if the -ment adverb suffixation were to be added in the word:\n\nAdditionally, French adverbials are derived from adjectives in a completely irregular fashion not even using the suffix -ment:\n\n\n"}

However, creators of the CD originally contemplated a four-channel, or quadraphonic, mode as well.\n\nThe proprietary Red Book specification, as published by Sony and Philips, briefly mentions a four-channel mode in its June 1980, September 1983, and November 1991 editions. On the first page, it lays out the \"Main parameters\" of the CD system, including: \"Number of channels: 2 and/or 4 simultaneously[*] sampled.\" The footnote says, \"In the case of more than two channels the encoder and decoder diagrams have to be adapted.\"\n\nThe Red Book also reserved the first bit of the so-called Q subchannel \"control field\" to signal the presence of four-channel audio, but did not specify a method for using four-channel in the CD system. Had it been later specified, this mode might have included four separate channels of linear PCM audio (requiring some combination of faster rotation, a lower sampling rate, or fewer bits per sample). Alternatively, the \"four-channel\" bit could have been used merely to indicate the presence of a matrix-encoded recording.\n\nIn reality, however, the underspecified \"four-channel\" mode was dropped from the CD standard when it was adopted by the International Electrotechnical Commission and became IEC 908:1987, and later IEC 60908:1999. (Various national authorities have also adopted the IEC standard. E.g., it is also European Standard EN 60908:1999.)\n\nNeither the 1987 nor the 1999 version of the IEC standard discusses the possibility of four-channel audio. Instead, the IEC document reserves the first bit of the Q subchannel \"control field\" to a different, although similarly cryptic, purpose—according to clause 17.5 note 2, it is for \"Broadcasting use\" in \"non-audio applications of the Compact Disc.\"\n\nSince the behavior of the \"four-channel\" or \"Broadcasting use\" bit was never specified by either CD standard, no mass-marketed discs have attempted to use the Red Book's four-channel mode, and no players have purported to implement it.\n\n\n"}

Blended whisky often uses a high proportion of Lowland malt, as the less intense flavour profile means it does not dominate the other constituent whiskies.\n\nIn terms of Lowlands whisky flavour, the character of the malt often comes through strongly, with a soft body, according to another report. Traditionally the barley used has been unpeated, possibly because the Lowlands, East Lothian in particular, had a strong coal-mining industry. \n\nAnother review states that most of the region's whiskies tend to be \"lighter and grassier\" without the \"smoky\" flavour produced by peat.\n\nHowever, in recent years lowland distilleries such as Ailsa Bay and Annandale have become characterised by their use of peat, with a flavor profile more typical of Islay whiskey.\n\nAccording to an August 2019 report, Auchentoshan is the region's only distillery still making whisky that is triple distilled which leads to \"an edge of citrus flavour\".\n\nThe distinction between the Lowlands and the Highlands was originally drawn by the 1784 Wash Act. Highland distilleries were taxed based upon the size of their still; Lowland distilleries were taxed per gallon in the wash. This led to outrage from Lowland distillers over their comparably high duty rates.\n\nToday the term Lowland is a \"protected locality\" for Scotch Whisky distilling under UK Government legislation. The modern Lowland–Highland line is drawn by the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 as follows:\n\nThis line is distinct from the geological Highland Fault line to the north. If the geological line were used, several Highland distilleries would become Lowland ones, including Loch Lomond and Fettercairn. According to \"Visit Scotland\", the Lowlands region covers \"much of the Central Belt and the South of Scotland including Edinburgh & The Lothians, Glasgow & The Clyde Valley, the Kingdom of Fife, Ayrshire, Dumfries & Galloway and the Scottish Borders\".

Oliver was best known for his work with graphic design studios 23 Envelope and v23. Both studios maintained a close relationship with record label 4AD between 1982 and 1998 and gave distinct visual identities for the 4AD releases by many bands, including Mojave 3, Lush, Cocteau Twins, The Breeders, This Mortal Coil, Pale Saints, Pixies, and Throwing Muses. Oliver also designed record sleeves for such artists as David Sylvian, The Golden Palominos, and Bush.\n\nA book collecting his work, \"Vaughan Oliver: Archive,\" was published in 2018.\n\nOliver was born in Sedgefield, County Durham on 12 September 1957. He developed an interest in graphic design through his love of music, in particular the work of Roger Dean. He said in 2014 \"There was no real culture, my parents were not really interested in anything unusual – everything I was getting was through record sleeves. It was a democratic way of discovering art.\" It was not until he studied graphic design at Newcastle upon Tyne Polytechnic that he took the subject seriously. Through his studies his interests broadened to include inspiration from the work of Salvador Dali, Surrealism and Pop artists such as Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol. After graduating in 1979, Oliver went to London hoping to find a designing job with a large design group. He soon found out that he was not made for working with big corporations or designing for the commercial world. He subsequently met the owner of the record label 4AD, Ivo Watts Russell. This encounter led to a thirty-year partnership between Vaughan Oliver and 4AD.\n\n23 Envelope consisted of Oliver (graphic design and typography) and Nigel Grierson (photography). Together, they created the artwork for almost all 4AD releases until 1987. Grierson left 23 Envelope in 1988. At that time, Oliver continued to work for 4AD under the studio name v23, collaborating with Simon Larbalestier, Marc Atkins and others.\n\nIn February 1990, Oliver was asked to bring together the work he had done so far for 4AD to be shown for the first time in an art gallery, the Espace Graslin in Nantes, France. The exhibition gathered so much media exposure throughout Europe that it subsequently moved to the Parc de la Villette in Paris. An illustrated catalogue titled Exhibition/Exposition was published to coincide with both Nantes and Paris exhibitions.\n\nIn 1994, many of those who had collaborated with Oliver over the previous decade contributed to an illustrated catalogue for the retrospective exhibition of his work held at the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles, \"This Rimy River\". Recollections of the v23 design experience were provided by individuals such as design writer Rick Poynor, and art critic Ian McKay who frames Oliver's work in a fine art context.\n\nIn 2000 a major monograph \"Vaughan Oliver: Visceral Pleasures\" by Rick Poyner was published by Booth-Clibborn Editions.\n\nIn 2005, to mark 25 years of 4AD records, Oliver produced a limited-edition publication of his poster designs, with a second-edition published to coincide with a solo exhibition of his posters staged at the Stanley Picker Gallery (Kingston University, London, UK) in 2007.\n\nIn 2011, Oliver was awarded an honorary Master of Arts from the University for the Creative Arts, where he taught on the Epsom campus as a visiting professor. Two books of work were published.\n\nOliver's album art helped to shape the aesthetic of 4AD, a cult indie record label that was prominent from the 1980s well into the 1990s. The mysterious qualities in his album art were inspired by surrealist painter Salvador Dalí, whom Oliver admired during his college years. Oliver created album artwork for a number of 4AD bands, including Pixies, Cocteau Twins, The Breeders and This Mortal Coil. Although Oliver worked exclusively with 4AD, he would occasionally work with non-music related clients. He had an influence on the post pop-punk music industry, inspiring hundreds of artists to be different, mysterious and explorative. During the early years of 4AD, Oliver was credited with giving the bands and the label an identity through his visual language, despite their adherence to different genres.\n\nOliver produced the artwork for the Pixies' entire discography during his lifetime, including the albums \"Come On Pilgrim\" (1987), \"Surfer Rosa\" (1988), \"Doolittle\" (1989), \"Bossanova\" (1990), \"Trompe Le Monde\" (1991), \"Indie Cindy\" (2014), \"Head Carrier\" (2016) and \"Beneath the Eyrie\" (2019), as well as numerous singles and EPs. In 2009, Oliver designed the Pixies' \"Minotaur\", a 26-pound box set consisting of the band's first five albums, a 96-page fine art book and a 52-page photo book. Oliver stated that, with each Pixies release, he had looked to achieve \"a sense of continuity\" within the catalog but also employ a \"fresh approach\", and that his ethos \"was always about building individual identities for bands.\"\n\nAmong Oliver's other interests was football. Oliver was a qualified FA coach, and he was a keen supporter of Sunderland. He designed the sleeve of their 1992 FA Cup single and had been approached by the club to redesign their crest.\n\nOliver died on 29 December 2019 at the age of 62.\n\n"}

The station is owned and operated by Entercom, and is simulcast with WFAN (660 AM). WFAN-FM's studios are located in the combined Entercom facility in the Hudson Square neighborhood of Manhattan and its transmitter is located at the Empire State Building. The station is also simulcast on WJFK-HD3 in Washington, D.C..\n\nThe station traces its origin to an experimental Apex band radio station, W2XWF on 42.18 MHz, which was authorized in 1940 and licensed to radio engineer William G. H. Finch. In 1941 the station was authorized to convert to a commercial FM station, W55NY transmitting on 45.5 MHz. In 1943 the call letters were changed to WFGG, which were changed to WGHF in 1945. One of the uses of the station was to test Finch's broadcast facsimile system. By 1946, the station was broadcasting on 99.7 MHz, moving to 101.9 in 1947. In late 1948, it became the New York City affiliate of the farm-oriented Rural Radio Network based in Ithaca, New York, which owned a group of upstate stations that would later associate with WQXR. In 1955, its then-owner, Muzak, changed the call letters to WBFM, reflecting its parent owner. The station aired a mostly-instrumental beautiful music radio format.\n\nThe station was purchased by the \"New York Daily News\" in late 1963. WBFM adopted the WPIX-FM call letters on October 11, 1964, as the station was now co-owned with television station WPIX (channel 11).\n\nBroadcasting from the \"Pix Penthouse\" on the 28th floor of the Daily News Building, WPIX-FM ushered in what was to become one of the most popular formats in FM radio, Easy Listening (later Adult Contemporary), signaling the end of the dominance of instrumental beautiful music, jazz, classical and block programming on the FM band. WPIX-FM would be noted for not being able to settle on a format for any real length of time, and was derisively nicknamed \"the format of the month station\" by many in the New York City radio industry. The station went through 11 different formats during its post-easy listening period:\n\n\nNotable air personalities during the WPIX-FM period included Mark Simone, Dennis Quinn, Jim Kerr, Alan Colmes, Meg Griffin, Les Marshak, Gus Gossert, Alfredo, Jane Hamburger, Dan Neer, Alfredo Santos, Rick Allison, Bill Vitka, Ted David and Jerry Carroll (a.k.a. \"Dr. Jerry\"), who would gain fame as commercial spokesperson for the Crazy Eddie electronics retail chain. Another WPIX-FM personality, Ken Harper, host of the all-night \"Manhattan After Hours,\" from 1964 to 1968, went on to produce \"The Wiz\" on Broadway.\n\nThe station gave up quickly on both the Disco and the Rock and Roll/New Wave formats, only to see both genres of music become popular several years later.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1988, WPIX-FM simulcast the Christmas music played during WPIX television's annual \"Yule Log\" program on Christmas Eve and Christmas morning.\n\n Beginning with \"The PIX Penthouse\" in 1985, WPIX-FM started to play contemporary jazz after dark to boost its nighttime ratings, and from September 1987, the station's evening programming was entirely dedicated to the genre. Then, on August 10, 1988, the station adopted a jazz-based adult contemporary format during the day and retained all jazz at night. Later that month, on August 22, the station modified into a full-time contemporary jazz (now known as Smooth Jazz) format, with the new call letters WQCD and the new branding, \"CD 101.9\". While the genre had varying degrees of presence on most Top 40 and AC stations at the time, New York City had not had a full-time commercial jazz station since 1980, when WRVR (106.7 FM, now WLTW) became country music station WKHK following an ownership change two years earlier. The re-launch of 101.9 was accompanied by a new television advertising campaign which featured Al Jarreau, Miles Davis, Kenny G, Bobby McFerrin and Herb Alpert–all artists whose music formed the core of the new smooth jazz format, which proved successful and long-lasting for a station that had not been used to stability in its programming.\n\nWQCD's early music blend featured contemporary jazz mixed with soft rock and urban adult contemporary, along with some new-age music (the \"CD\" branding came from the station promoting that it played between 70-80 minutes of music between commercial breaks, the length of an average compact disc). The station programmed an equal balance between vocal and instrumental music. At night the station played strictly contemporary jazz music, with a majority of it instrumental. As time went on, WQCD phased-out soft-rock cuts and became a full-time contemporary jazz station. The playlist continued to feature large amounts of instrumental jazz, with some new age, and several urban adult contemporary songs. This formula would largely be unchanged for over 15 years.\n\n WQCD ran an experiment from November 22, 2004 until August 2005, when the station's playlist included chill music, a relaxing sound based on the music found on the beaches of Ibiza. The ratings were not satisfactory, and the experiment ended. The station retained the tagline, \"CD101.9, Your Chill-Out Station\" during its successful transition back to the standard smooth jazz format.\n\n WQCD's on-air staff remained unusually stable in the generally volatile radio climate, led by morning host Dennis Quinn. Midday host Deborah Rath had been with parent company Emmis since 1988, as a veteran of both WRKS and WQHT. Afternoon drive host Paul Cavalconte was a veteran of New York jazz, classical, and rock stations, adult standards WNEW. Evening host Sharon Davis called WQCD home for nearly a decade. Rafe Gomez hosted \"The Groove Boutique\", a syndicated groove jazz mix show that aired on Saturday nights beginning in 2003.\n\n On February 5, 2008 at 4:00 p.m., Emmis Communications announced a change to a rock format under the WRXP call letters and the tagline 101.9 RXP: The New York Rock Experience. The last songs played on \"CD 101.9\" were \"Shining Star\" by The Manhattans and an instrumental rendition of \"Street Life\" by U-Nam, while the first two songs played on \"RXP\" were \"Rock and Roll\" by Velvet Underground and \"Supernatural Superserious\" by R.E.M.. With the exception of Paul Cavalconte, the entire WQCD air staff was released including Dennis Quinn, who had survived every other format change at 101.9 since joining the station in 1971. Only program director Blake Lawrence was retained from the previous format for WRXP. Emmis cited a declining audience for smooth jazz, which moved to the station's HD2 subcarrier. (An online version of CD101.9 would eventually be launched in late summer 2015.)\n\nWRXP was the first alternative rock station in New York City since WXRK's format flip to active rock in April 2005. Even though classified as alternative rock (with a slight adult album alternative lean), Nielsen BDS and Mediabase reported WRXP as an AAA, with suburban station WXPK recognized as the main AAA station in the New York City market. By 2011, WRXP was classified as an alternative rock station by both Nielsen BDS and Mediabase.\n\nWRXP's first on-air personality was Brian Schock, who, until leaving the station to return to San Diego in January 2009, was also the station's assistant program director and music director. Station management promised to hire a New York rock-savvy airstaff for the rest of the station's dayparts. Among those hired were veteran radio and MTV personality Matt Pinfield as the morning drive host; Steve Craig as midday host; and Brian Phillips as evening host. The weekend air staff included Dave Greek, Greg Russ and Jennifer Kajzer, as well as Cavalconte, the only personality retained from the WQCD smooth jazz format. In March 2009, WRXP announced that Nik Carter, formerly of WXRK, and later with VH1, joined as the station as its afternoon drive personality.\n\nOn June 16, 2008, Leslie Fram, formerly of WNNX in Atlanta, was appointed Program Director. She also co-hosted the WRXP morning drive (and later midday) show with Pinfield.\n\nOn November 9, 2008, \"Anything Anything with Rich Russo\" debuted on the station.\n\nOn June 21, 2011, it was announced that majority ownership of WRXP was acquired by Merlin Media LLC, a new entity headed by veteran radio executive Randy Michaels. The sale, which the FCC approved in September 2011, included two other Emmis-owned stations in Chicago, WLUP-FM and WKQX. Merlin registered several domains for what the new format of the station would be, including a return of WYNY's country music format, but many suggested an FM news format. All of the DJs, except for Cavalconte, were dismissed, and at 5 PM on July 15, 2011, WRXP's rock format ended with \"Long Live Rock\" by The Who. WRXP's website (MyRXP.com) continued operation after the station left the airwaves, continuing to offer its music format via streaming online audio and later a Spotify playlist (with occasional new songs added) until Merlin acquired the domain name (see below).\n\nAfter a brief period of dead air, WRXP (whose call sign was changed to WEMP on July 21) switched to a stunt of Adult Contemporary music branded as \"101.9 FM New,\" which served as a transition to the station's new format. The first song on \"FM New\" was All Summer Long by Kid Rock. \"101.9 FM New\" featured a live morning show that began at 6:00 on July 18, hosted by Paul Cavalconte (who had been with 101.9 since 1998), with Jeff McKay (a New York traffic reporter formerly of Shadow Traffic and WINS) providing traffic reports and weather updates (until the next day when Meteorologist Scott Derek began). News reports and news blocks were gradually introduced beginning with a 3PM newscast on July 25, 2011, anchored by Dave Packer and Mike Barker.\n\nOn August 12, 2011, the station ended its Adult Contemporary stunt and went full-time all-news as \"FM News 101.9,\" following in the footsteps of its Chicago sister station WWWN (the former and current WKQX), which flipped to all-news on July 29. As conceived by Merlin's then-COO, Walter Sabo, \"FM News\" was what Sabo considered a \"redefining\" of the all-news format; the on-air presentation was generally looser and conversational in tone, while an emphasis was placed on lifestyle, health, and entertainment features. The initial news staff at WEMP included those with experience in New York radio, including WINS alums Catherine Smith, Alice Stockton-Rossini, and Brett Larson, as well as former WCBS anchor Therese Crowley and WRXP holdover Paul Cavalconte.\n\nOver time, the \"FM News\" approach on WEMP would be adjusted. The reliance on lifestyle and entertainment features was decreased; the station turned towards a tighter on-air presentation and hard news format. Several new features were added, including \"10 minutes of non-stop news\" at :00, :20 and :40 past the hour (similar to the fact that WINS delivers news headlines at these intervals), the \"top 5 trending stories\" leading off every hour, and hourly sports and business updates.\nThey also advertised \"traffic and weather on the 5s\". Coinciding with the on-air changes was a major promotional push, including television ads and promotions that tweaked WINS' longtime \"22 minutes\" slogan, with WEMP proclaiming \"Give us 10 minutes, we'll give you the world.\" (After WINS owner CBS Radio sent a cease-and-desist letter to Merlin Media, WEMP dropped the slogan, and replaced it by \"non-stop news\".) Then, Merlin Media fought back against WINS by demanding them not to call itself as \"New York's One and Only All-News Station\" (to highlighting its round-the-clock newswheel as opposed to WCBS carrying some live sports broadcasts if there's an overlap with WFAN) on the air, because this was misleading according to WEMP's format at the time.\n\nIn the time FM News was in operation, it was plagued by a variety of technical issues after management in Chicago decided to automate the news, much like some music stations automate music formats. The controversial approach led to a number of on-air gaffes, including wrong time checks and news stories misplaced. The only live elements on the air were traffic reports, which were reportedly demanded by a manager at WEMP, despite the traffic reports being recorded by their Chicago sister station. The expanded traffic reports became one of the few successes of the radio station, and several months later, Chicago's \"FM News 101.1\" would also return to the live traffic reports.\n\nWEMP and its all-news format struggled to make gains in Arbitron ratings. For example, in the period ending January 4, 2012, Arbitron rated WEMP at a 0.5, far behind both of the CBS Radio-owned all-news stations in New York, category leader WINS at 3.2 and WCBS at 2.8 in that month. (WEMP's share was lower than one of the last ratings books for WRXP, a 2.6 share in July 2011.)\n\nIn July 2012, there was speculation that Merlin Media would convert WEMP to a news/talk hybrid, similar to its sister stations in Philadelphia (WWIQ) and Chicago (WIQI, which was also struggling in ratings with all-news and had added some talk programming). Instead, Merlin had other plans for the station. On July 17, 2012, at 10AM (ET), Merlin management held meetings with the news staffs of both WEMP and WIQI; while the meeting took place, a newscast on \"FM News 101.9\" was abruptly cut off and replaced by the reporting of one final story — an announcement that the all-news format was ending immediately. \nAfter a brief period of dead air, WEMP then returned to an alternative rock format under the \"New Rock 101.9\" branding, with \"No Sleep Till Brooklyn\" by the Beastie Boys the first song played. (At the very same time, WIQI transitioned from all-news to adult hits.) In a press release, Merlin CEO Randy Michaels called dropping all-news from both WEMP and WIQI \"a difficult decision to make\" but one that had to be made in light of \"minimal audience engagement.\" Several \"FM News 101.9\" staffers were released by Merlin, with a handful retained by the company to likely serve as reporters for Merlin's WWIQ in Philadelphia.\n\n\"New Rock 101.9\" (\"New Rock for New York\") featured a playlist that included current and recent alternative rock songs and artists. The presentation included an irreverent attitude and the \"backselling\" (identification of artist and song title) at the end of many current songs. To coincide with the format change back to rock, Merlin Media made two noteworthy moves: It filed a request with the FCC on July 18 to revert the station's call sign from WEMP to WRXP (the calls were officially changed on July 25), while also obtaining WRXP-related domain names from the station's previous owner, Emmis Communications, including MyRXP.com (which would redirect to the station's NewRock1019.com website). \"New Rock 101.9\" ran with limited on-air talent, including former WRXP host Brian Phillips on middays, with the possibility that other former 'RXP staffers would be invited to rejoin the station. The WEMP calls by coincidence moved back to Wisconsin upon their release by Merlin, and are now in use by an easy listening station licensed to Two Rivers which began full-time operations in December 2014.\n\nDespite WRXP making gains in the Arbitron ratings with its revived alternative format (the station jumped to a 1.6 share in July, and then to a 2.1 share in August), Merlin Media was faced with a high debt load from recent purchases and the cost of its failed news format. Additionally, one of Merlin's investors was seeking buyers for the company's stations. Merlin announced on October 8, 2012 that it had agreed to sell WRXP to CBS Radio. With the purchase (estimated at $75 million), CBS said it would convert WRXP to a simulcast of its sports radio station WFAN. The simulcast began at 11:57 PM on November 1, 2012, after Jeff Buckley's \"Last Goodbye\" brought a close to WRXP's \"New Rock\" format. A call sign change from WRXP to WFAN-FM took effect the next day, November 2. CBS operated WFAN-FM under a local marketing agreement. until closing its purchase on December 10, 2012. The LMA officially relieved Merlin Media of its only New York radio property and allowed it to concentrate on its stations in the Chicago and Philadelphia markets.\n\nThe purchase of 101.9 by CBS put WFAN back on equal footing with ESPN Radio affiliate WEPN, which made its own AM-to-FM move in April 2012 (to the former WRKS). Speculation at the time suggested that the move would also allow CBS to split the WFAN simulcast at a later date and ensure a full-power New York home for its new national sports network, CBS Sports Radio, which began daily programming in January 2013 (and currently airs on the HD3 subchannel of WCBS-FM). Such a move would have mirrored CBS-owned sports talk pairings in markets such as Baltimore, where WJZ airs CBS Sports Radio full-time and WJZ-FM airs local sports talk. However, the simulcast has continued since 2012. Due to MLB and NFL blackout rules, WFAN is only allowed to air sporting events involving the New York-area teams within its home market.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on November 17.\n\n"}

From 1938 to 1940, he was Research Associate at the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in Berlin. From 1941 to 1945 he was a professor at the Ukrainian Free University in Prague and he taught at the University of Heidelberg from 1945 to 1948.\n\nIn 1949 he emigrated to Canada where he organized and became head of the Department of Slavic Studies at the University of Manitoba. He stayed there until his retirement in 1976. With the historian, Dmytro Doroshenko and the literary scholar, Leonid Biletsky, he was a co-founder of the Canadian branch of the Ukrainian Free Academy of Sciences which is located in Winnipeg. He became the third president (1955–1970) and one of the most important scholars in this emigre institution which carried out a wide-ranging publication program during his presidency. After his retirement from the University of Manitoba, he moved to Montreal in eastern Canada from which he frequently commuted to Ottawa to work in the National Archives of Canada and teach at the University of Ottawa.\n\nHis books include \"The Ukrainian Language and Its Dialects\", in Ukrainian, (1937; 5th revised ed. 1978), a German-language textbook of Ukrainian (1940; 4th ed. 1964), \"A Modern Ukrainian Grammar\" for English speakers (1949; reprinted seven times), and a pioneering but incomplete English-language \"Etymological Dictionary of the Ukrainian Language\" (2 volumes in 22 fascicles, 1962–1982). He also produced several smaller Ukrainian language books on the origins of various Ukrainian placenames including \"Galicia\", \"Volhynia\", and, in most detail, \"Ukraine\". As well, he wrote on Canadian, especially Manitoban, placenames of Ukrainian origin.\n\nDuring the Second World War, he published a short Ukrainian-German Dictionary which quickly went through four editions: (1940; 1941; 1942; and 1943). Together with Zenon Kuzelia, he also published a much larger Ukrainian-German Dictionary (1943; reprinted 1983) which was a pioneering effort in its day. (It contained over 100,000 words.)\n\nDuring the Cold War era, Rudnyckyj published a series of books which chronicled his visits to various libraries and centres of Ukrainian cultural life and scholarship in the West. Among these his Ukrainian language books on his \"Travels Across Half the World\" (1955), \"Travels Through America\" (1956), and \"Travels Through Canada\" (1959?) are especially notable.\n\nHis reports on various North American libraries, including the American \"Library of Congress\", which contained substantial Slavic and Ukrainian holdings, are also worthy of mention. These reports formed a supplement to his annual bibliographic reports on the progress of Slavic and Ukrainian scholarship and literature in Canada which he published throughout the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nRudnyckyj's work in Ukrainian dialect studies, etymology, and onomastics naturally led to interests in folklore, and during his Canadian period, he published numerous works on Ukrainian Canadian folklore. The source collection titled \"Ukrainian-Canadian Folklore and Dialectological Texts\" was published in Ukrainian in several volumes beginning in 1956. One volume even appeared in English translation.\n\nRudnyckyj was a prolific contributor to the Ukrainian-language press in North America, especially in Canada. In these shorter pieces, he popularized his various scholarly researches, informed the public about academic affairs, and wrote on his extensive travels across Canada and to various other countries.\n\nOn occasion, Rudnyckyj also approached more openly political topics, especially those connected with his professional interests as a linguist. Thus during the Cold War, he was very concerned about the fate of the Ukrainian language under Soviet rule, and, comparing its situation with that of other languages under political pressure, pioneered the concept of \"linguicide\".\n\nAfter his retirement from the University of Manitoba and his move to Montreal, he became active in the emigre government of the Ukrainian People's Republic which had been forced from the territory of Ukraine in 1920 by its rival Soviet government. In 1992, after the emergence of an independent Ukraine, he took part in the transfer of the mandate of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the new Ukrainian state.\n\nFrom 1963 to 1971, Rudnyckyj was a member of the Canadian Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism and with others promoted the idea of a multilingual Canada which recognized the importance of regional languages. His contribution to the Fourth Book of the Report of the Royal Commission, which dealt with the needs and contributions of \"other ethnic groups\" to Canadian society, was substantial and directly led to the promulgation of the new policy of \"Multiculturalism\" by the federal government of Canada, and thereafter, by several provinces as well.\n\nIn 1992, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.\n\nRudnyckyj's personal bibliography, was published in four parts beginning in 1975; in the last part published in 1995 under the title \"J.B. Rudnyckyj: Repertorium Bibliographicum Addenda 1984–1994\", the list reaches a very impressive 2967 titles, although most of these are short pamphlets and newspaper articles. Among his numerous students, John Pauls (Sydoruk), Volodymyr Zhyla, Robert Klymasz, Forvyn Bohdan, and Stephen Holutiak-Hallick continued his work in onomastics and other fields.\n\nAnd also available at: https://www.academia.edu/38519781/J._B._Rudnyckyj_and_Canada.pdf Very brief biographical portrait, which includes a discussion of Rudnyckyj’s philological interests and concentrates upon his impressions of the unique character of the Ukrainian language spoken in Canada in the 1940s and the 1950s.\n"}

Until its collapse in June 2010, Cyprus Turkish Airlines was the primary airline flying passengers to Northern Cyprus.\n\nKTHY operated scheduled flights from Ercan, Northern Cyprus, to several cities in Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Western and Northern Europe. Its main base was Ercan Airport, in the Turkish sector of Nicosia.\n\nThe airline was \"de jure\" registered as a Turkish company in Istanbul. Day-to-day operations were run from Ercan. All flights to Europe were required to make a stop at an airport in mainland Turkey.\n\nCyprus Turkish Airlines was established on 4 December 1974 in Nicosia, with shares equally divided between Turkish Airlines and the Cash Development of the Consolidated Fund of the Assembly of the Turkish Cypriot Community (\"Konsolide Fonu Inkisaf Sandigi\"). The first scheduled flight took place on 3 February 1975.\n\nIn 2005, the Turkish government sold its shares to Ada Havayollari.\n\nBy June 2010, KTHY had incurred a $100 million debt, and its management decided to sell the company to avoid bankruptcy. The Turkish carrier Atlasjet was the only bidder.\n\nOn 21 June 2010, the airline announced via its website that it had ceased all operations until further notice. On 29 June 2010, it was announced that the airline had gone out of business.\n\n\nAs of 13 March 2010, the Cyprus Turkish Airlines fleet consisted of the following aircraft:\n\nAs of 14 March 2010, the average age of the fleet was 6.5 years. According to the \"Cyprus Observer\", KTHY had planned to extend its fleet to 12 aircraft, to be in service by 2012 with the airline's updated livery.\n\nMost of the fleet parked at Ercan overnight, but some aircraft overnighted at Turkish airports.\n\n\nCyprus Turkish Airlines offered only two classes: \n\nIn early 2008, the airline introduced an express check-in service at Ercan for passengers who were not checking any bags. There were separate express check-in counters for passengers with only carry-on luggage and for those without any luggage at all.\n\nThe airline had a \"Special Passenger Programme for Frequent Flyers\". Participants had priority for seat reservations and an extra baggage allowance, avoided waiting at check-in, and earned points redeemable for travel.\n\nAll Cyprus Turkish Airlines flight attendants were women until the start of the 2008 summer schedule in July, when the airline began using male flight attendants as well.\n\nOn 7 April 2010, starting at 6 a.m., Cyprus Turkish Airlines staff staged a six-hour wildcat strike that grounded all planes. Travellers to and from Northern Cyprus were distressed and severely inconvenienced. Communication from the airline to travelers about the delays was poor.\n\nA monthly, in-flight magazine was produced for KTHY, titled \"Caretta\". It generally contained information about Northern Cyprus such as cultural background, tourist destinations, and upcoming events. The magazine was also available on the airline's website.\n\nOn 30 March 1998, Mehmet Ertürk hijacked a KTHY flight from Ercan to Ankara, using a lighter designed to resemble a hand grenade. The plane landed safely in Ankara, and Ertürk was arrested.\n\n"}

A R&B record with heavy elements of soul and hip hop music, it involves a diverse roster of collaborators including Scott Storch, Lil Jon, The Underdogs, Carvin & Ivan, and Sean Garrett. The album guests include Cassidy, Juvenile, and Baby Cham.\n\nThe first single from the album was \"Let Me Love You\", which was written by Ne-Yo was a number one hit in the United States and number two in the United Kingdom, becoming Mario's biggest hit to date. The second single was a split single. In the US, \"How Could You\", a song written by Bay Area singer-songwriter J. Valentine, was released (reaching number 52) but in the UK, \"Here I Go Again\" was released (reaching number 11). The fourth and final single from the album in the US was \"Boom\", featuring Juvenile. In support of the album, Mario supported R&B trio Destiny's Child in their tour, Destiny Fulfilled ... And Lovin' It, as an opening act for the American leg.\n\nIn an interview with MTV, Mario explained, \"One of the biggest reasons I wanted to do it is that I did want to stand out from everybody. I get to share it with the world... It's good for me. I been blessed to be in this situation. Everything's been going great. I just been pacing myself, working real hard on this album. That's what my life is about right now: my transition into manhood.\"\n\nThe interviewer from MTV said, \"If you look at the production credits for the mid-tempo record, you may be surprised to discover that the song was produced by Scott Storch, who's been making noise with club bangers like \"Baby Boy\" and \"Lean Back\" the last couple of years.\"\n\nMario said, \"He did a lot of stuff back in the day, you'd be surprised,\" Mario said of the producer's talents and versatility. \"He played me some stuff he did for Erykah Badu, for Lauryn Hill, for Eminem and 50 Cent. When I went to Scott, we went in the studio and freestyled and came up with some great records.\"\n\nThe interviewer stated, \"Storch also produced \"Call the Cops\" and the \"Let Me Love You\" remix with Jadakiss and T.I. Mario called on Lil Jon and Juvenile for \"Boom.\"\n\nMario said, \"It's a straight club banger... There's another record called 'How Could You.' I did that with the Underdogs. It's a ballad about me being in a relationship with some shorty. She was doing some things behind my back. I'm telling her, 'Yo, how can you teach somebody the ghetto Kama Sutra?' It's a timeless record, real strong and powerful. Then there's a record called 'Nikes Fresh Out the Box.' I'm talking about a girl, but I'm comparing her to my Nikes.\"\n\n\nDue to the success of the album, it was repackaged and released in a DualDisc format on April 19, 2005 in the US. It includes the album in enhanced stereo, the music videos for \"Let Me Love You\" and \"How Could You\", sessions at AOL Special Live Performances of \"Let Me Love You\" and \"How Could You\", and a photo gallery.\n\nIn his review from AllMusic, Jason Birchmeier wrote that \"there's not much else on \"Turning Point\" that comes close to matching the balladic magic of \"Let Me Love You\" [...] Above all, though, it's \"Let Me Love You\" and its remix that make \"Turning Point\" a noteworthy effort for this teenager and a fine second album overall.\" Jem Aswad from \"Entertainment Weekly\" said that \"Turning Point\" \"is plenty catchy, but it’s also so full of sugar that the spoon stands up,\" giving the album a B-. Virgin Media said that \"the production is tight throughout the album but not overly polished, and there is enough edge maintained from start to finish to suggest that Mario may indeed buck a few R&B trends in the months to come.\"\n\nBaz Dreisinger from \"Blender\" felt that \"though the Baltimore-born singer is newly legal (as he tells us on the too-terse club jam \"18\"), his enticingly even-toned voice—smooth as R. Kelly's—transcends teen-pop. It's even manly enough to convey lovelorn intensity (\"Here I Go Again\"), offer explicit \"Directions\" to an uncorrupted gal pal (\"Trust me, I got skills\"), then sweetly stage an \"intimate talk\" with her (\"Like Me Real Hard\"). Only his age-appropriate tracks—the singsong club jingle \"Girl I Need\", or the irony-free homage to \"Nikes fresh out the box\"—remind us that Mario is not a boy, but not yet a man.\" \"USA Today\" critic Steve Jones found that \"the material seems more what you'd expect from an 18-year-old [...] There are still a few lightweight ditties and songs that show he hasn't completely left his youth behind (\"Nikes\"), but he seems pointed in the right direction.\"\n\nThe album was nominated for Best Contemporary R&B Album at the Grammy Awards.\n\n\"Turning Point\"s first appearance was in the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling roughly 161,000 copies in the first week, debuting at number thirteen. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling over 1.2 million copies. The album's last appearance was week 37/2005 in the Belgium Albums Top 50. Its peak position was number 6, on the Dutch Albums Top 100; it stayed there for one week. Its highest entry was number 9 in the Dutch Albums Top 100.\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Turning Point\".\n\nNotes and sample credits\n\nCredits are adapted from the album’s Liner Notes and AllMusic.\n\n"}

{"id": "1935466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935466", "title": "Yan Emperor", "text": "Yan Emperor\n\nThe Yan Emperor () or the Flame Emperor was a legendary ancient Chinese ruler in pre-dynastic times. Modern scholarship has identified the Sheep's Head Mountains (\"Yángtóu Shān\") just north of Baoji in Shaanxi Province as his homeland and territory.\n\nA long debate has existed over whether or not the Yan Emperor was the same person as the legendary Shennong. An academic conference held in China in 2004 achieved general consensus that the Yan Emperor and Shennong were the same person. Another possibility is that the term \"flame emperor\" was a title, held by dynastic succession of tribal lords, with Shennong being known as \"Yandi\" perhaps posthumously. Accordingly, the term \"flame emperors\" would be generally more correct. The succession of these flame emperors, from Shennong, the first Yan Emperor, until the time of the last Yan Emperor's defeat by the Yellow Emperor, may have been some 500 years.\n\nNo written records are known to exist from the era of Yan Emperor's reign. However, he and Shennong are mentioned in many of the classic works of ancient China. \"Yan\" literally means \"flame\", implying that Yan Emperor's people possibly uphold a symbol of fire as their tribal totems. K. C. Wu speculates that this appellation may be connected with the use of fire to clear the fields in slash and burn agriculture. In any case, it appears that agricultural innovations by Shennong and his descendants contributed to some sort of socioeconomic success that lead them to style themselves as \"di\" (), rather than \"hou\" (), as in the case of lesser tribal leaders. At this time it appears that there were only the bare beginnings of written language, and that for record keeping a system of knotting strings (perhaps similar to quipu) was in use. The Zuo Zhuan states that in 525 BC, the descendants of Yan were recognized as long having been masters of fire and having used fire in their names. Yan Emperor was known as \"Emperor of the South\"\n\nThe last Yan Emperor, met the end of his reign in the third of a series of three battles, known as the Battle of Banquan. The exact location of this battle is disputed among modern historians, due to multiple locations adopting the same name at various points through history. Possible candidates include Zhuolu County and Huailai County in Zhangjiakou, Hebei, Yanqing District in Beijing, Fugou County in Zhoukou, Henan, and Yanhu District in Yuncheng, Shanxi.\n\nThe Yan Emperor, retreating from a recent invasion from the forces of Chi You, came into territorial conflict with its neighbouring Youxiong tribes, led by the Yellow Emperor. The Yan Emperor was defeated after three successive battles and surrendered to the Yellow Emperor, who assumed the title of overlord () and agreed to merge the two tribes into a new confederation — the Yanhuang tribe. Under the Yellow Emperor's leadership, the newly combined tribes then went to war and defeated Chi You in the Battle of Zhuolu, and established their cultural and political dominance in China proper.\n\nSince the Battle of Banquan is treated as a historical fact by Sima Qian in his \"Records of the Grand Historian\", it would appear that this is a pivotal transition point between mythology and history. Ironically, Yan Emperor enters history only with his submission to the will of the Yellow Emperor. In any case, the title of \"flame emperor\" apparently lapsed after this time, while his tribe's descendants were said to be perpetuated through intermarriage with that of the Yellow Emperor, and Han Chinese throughout history have referred themselves as the \"Descendants of Yan and Huang\".\n\nBoth Huangdi and Yandi are considered in some sense ancestral to Chinese culture and people. Also, the tradition of associating a certain color with a particular dynasty may have begun with the Flame Emperors. According to the Five Elements, or Wu Xing model, red, fire, should be succeeded by yellow, earth—or Yandi by Huangdi.\n\nThis is the most common list given by Huangfu Mi, Xu Zheng, and Sima Zhen:\n\nList provided at the end of the Shan Hai Jing:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1935482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935482", "title": "Iqaluit Airport", "text": "Iqaluit Airport\n\nIqaluit Airport serves Iqaluit, Nunavut, Canada and is located adjacent to the city. It is operated by the government of Nunavut. It hosts scheduled passenger service from Ottawa, Montreal, Rankin Inlet, and Kuujjuaq on carriers such as Canadian North, and from smaller communities throughout eastern Nunavut. It is also used as a forward operating base by the CF-18 Hornet. In 2011, the terminal handled more than 120,000 passengers.\n\nThe airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers at this airport can handle general aviation aircraft only, with no more than 15 passengers.\n\nThe airport serves as a diversion airport on polar routes.\n\nThe airport is owned by the Government of Nunavut (GN) and operated, under a 30-year contract, by Nunavut Airport Services. The company is a subsidiary of Winnipeg Airport Services Corporation, which in turn is a subsidiary of Winnipeg Airports Authority.\n\nDuring late July 1941, a United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) team headed by Captain Elliott Roosevelt investigated the Frobisher Bay region for a potential airport for use in trans-Atlantic air traffic. Roosevelt's report designated a marginal site at Cape Rammelsberg for later construction. In mid-October, trawlers \"Lark\", \"Polarbjoern\", and \"Selis\" reached the vicinity, but owing to inaccurate charts (dating from the 1865 expedition of Charles Francis Hall) could not find the Roosevelt site. Instead, an eight-man crew commanded by USAAF Captain John T. Crowell was offloaded on a smaller island \"about eight miles southeast of the headland Captain Roosevelt had recommended.\" They operated a weather/radio station over the winter. The expedition reported that \"this island is reported to be some 400 feet high and very level on top providing a natural runway of more than a mile in length.\" The ships left on 5 November.\n\nWhen the station relief and base construction expedition arrived next July, both the Crowell and Roosevelt sites were rejected in favour of a level meadow discovered along the Sylvia Grinnell River on mainland Baffin Island. On 30 July, ships \"Polaris\" and \"Effie M. Morrissey\" anchored in what was then called Koojesse Inlet and began surveying the area: \"The terrain was excellent, with level ground extending nearly the entire 6,000 feet needed for an ample runway...The harbor, readily accessible from the bay, offered a good anchorage for ships of any size that would come in.\" The expedition consisted further of the USCGC \"Bear\", equipped with a seaplane, the transports \"Fairfax\" and \"Eleanor\" and some smaller vessels. Having offloaded the airport construction crews and materials, the expedition left at the end of September.\nBy summer of 1943, the airbase at Koojesse Inlet had \"grown to look like a populous village\" and was in use by many aircraft. It was designated Crystal II and referred to as \"Chaplet\" in coded communications. It was one of three \"Crystal\" weather sites in the Canadian Arctic Region, Fort Chimo (now Kuujjuaq), Quebec being \"Crystal I\", and a station on Padloping Island being \"Crystal III\". A detachment of the 8th Weather Squadron, Air Transport Command (ATC) took up residence at the station on October 1, 1942. The initial mission of the Crystal sites was to provide long-range weather information to the combat forces then building up in the United Kingdom.\n\nAs part of the Crimson East air route network, the airfield at Crystal II was referred to by USAAF Air Transport Command as ATC Station #10. It was intended to be a transport hub between the Eastern Route, which originated at Presque Isle Army Airfield, Maine and the Central Route, which originated at Romulus Army Airfield (Detroit Airport), Michigan. The original plan, briefed by Captain Roosevelt to USAAF Chief Henry \"Hap\" Arnold and others at the Argentia summit in August 1941, called for Frobisher Bay to be a node in a northern alternate air route, running from Churchill, Manitoba via Southampton Island over Frobisher to Bluie West Eight and Bluie East Two in Greenland, rejoining the main route in Iceland. The later success of the main air route via Bluie West One and the spring 1943 victory in the Battle of the Atlantic led to cancelation of the Crimson project in late 1943, and the associated airfields were reduced to weather, communications, and logistics duties.\n\nThe use of Frobisher Bay declined with the end of World War II, with jurisdiction of the facility being transferred to Military Air Transport Service (MATS) in 1948, under its Air Weather Service. During the 1950s it continued to be used as a transit point by the \nUnited States and Canada. The base was closed in 1963 and converted into a civilian airport.\n\nSince the 1950s, Frobisher Bay had earned a reputation as a technical stop for airlines flying the North Atlantic. Crews departing westward from Prestwick or Shannon in those years preferred to route via Iceland (or the Azores) to Gander, thence to New York City or elsewhere. Weather, however, could dictate a northerly course, which is when Frobisher Bay came into its own. In 1959 Pan American even had a base there and on at least two occasions had to change engines on Douglas DC-7Cs at Frobisher Bay.\n\nWith the introduction of the intercontinental Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, fewer airlines stopped at Iqaluit. The place remained prominent as a regional airport, continued in its strategic role of sustaining the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW), supported the occasional military exercise or scientific expedition, and was a key stopover on the North Atlantic ferry route.\n\nThrough the 1960s, Nordair was the main airline serving Frobisher Bay from Montreal, to the south. Douglas DC-4s operated into the 1970s and Lockheed Super Constellations between 1964 and 1969. In 1968 Nordair introduced the Boeing 737-200 on the Frobisher Bay run. At the same time, Bradley Air Services had been expanding. By the 1970s, the company's fleet of de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters and Douglas DC-3s was serving many small Arctic communities from YFB, carrying passengers, mail, groceries, and other essentials. Bradley became known as First Air in 1973 and soon added BAe 748s.\n\nIn the 1980s, Canada's airline industry was in transition, with Air Canada and Canadian Airlines rapidly buying up regional operators. Air Canada acquired Nordair in 1977, and then sold it in 1984 to Canadian Airlines. Jet service to Iqaluit Airport continued, but under the Canadian North banner, which was, after the buyout of Canadian Airlines by Air Canada, to continue operations as an independent airline, jointly owned by the Inuit of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Between 1985 and 1988 First Air added four Boeing 727s to link Montreal and Ottawa with Iqaluit. Meanwhile, Canadian Airlines failed, and was taken over by Air Canada in 2000. In 1995 First Air purchased the small Yellowknife-based carrier, Ptarmigan Airways; then, in 1997, Northwest Territorial Airways (NWT Air), Air Canada's Yellowknife subsidiary. In acquiring NWT Air First Air obtained two 737-200 Combis and a Lockheed 382 Hercules.\n\n\nIqaluit International Airport Fire Department operates one crash tender for local fire suppression and has support from Iqaluit Fire Department when needed.\n\nThe main terminal (c.1986) has:\n\nAs a result of increased traffic, limited post-security waiting area and subsiding taxiway, the Nunavut government planned an overhaul of the airport that was expected to cost $250–300 million. The project was a public–private partnership with the GN borrowing their half of the cost. Nunavut Airport Services will operate the airport for 30 years. Upgrades included:\n\nThe construction began in 2014 and was completed on August 8, 2017, with flight service beginning the following day. On September 5, 2015, during construction, a large fire caused major damage to the roof of the new terminal, costing an estimated $1 million. Aside from the fire, other challenges encountered in the construction include thawing permafrost, electricity demands, housing for construction workers, extreme cold temperatures and short daylight hours in winter, and advanced planning to take advantage of summer sea lifts to lower the delivery cost of construction materials.\n\nThe new terminal has:\n\nOver the years several international flights have been diverted to Iqaluit due to technical reasons, air rage or on-board medical emergencies with no deaths being reported. On 31 May 1996, Virgin Atlantic flight 7 from London to Los Angeles made an emergency landing at Iqaluit after a passenger had a heart attack. The landing was executed safely - the first Boeing 747 ever to attempt to land at Iqaluit - but one of the 747's engines hit a fuel pump on the tarmac as it was taxiing, causing serious damage to the aircraft and a potentially dangerous fuel spill. The 397 stranded passengers, including singer Gary Barlow, were flown out after Virgin Atlantic chartered two jets. The passengers, after spending 16 hours in a local curling rink, were taken to New York to catch connecting flights to Los Angeles. Prince Michael of Kent, who had also been on the flight, was given a Royal Canadian Mounted Police escort and departed on an earlier scheduled flight. The original aircraft had its engines repaired and left four days after the accident. The heart-attack victim survived.\nThe Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger jet, conducted cold weather testing from Iqaluit Airport during February 2006 - its first North American visit. They were hoping to experience weather to determine the effects on cabin temperatures and engine performance. Nunavut authorities hoped that the importance of these tests would put Iqaluit on the map as a centre for cold-weather testing. In February 2013, Airbus Military used the airport to test the Airbus A400M Atlas military transport aircraft. The city government sent a delegation to Paris Airshow in June 2013 to promote Iqaluit as an ideal location for these tests. Airbus A350 followed suit and conducted its cold weather testing in January 2014. Airport staff cited low landing fee, sufficient runway length, and minimal air traffic movement all helped in the decision making. Following from these previous successful visits by prototype Airbus aircraft, the company sent the first A320neo with CFM International LEAP engines to be tested in January 2016. As part of the type's first visit to North America, the jet performed several circuits in the subzero temperatures before departing back to Toulouse–Blagnac Airport.\n\nIn December 2005 the Government of Nunavut announced that it would spend $40 million to repair the runway, build a new emergency services facility and a new terminal.\n\nIn January 2012 Air Greenland announced that a 1-hour, 45-minute flight from Nuuk to Iqaluit, down from three days when going via Copenhagen or Reykjavik and then on to Ottawa, would begin 18 June 2012, later changed to 15 June. The service was a partnership with First Air who provided ticketing and other services in Iqaluit. This was the first international flight into Iqaluit since 2001 when First Air discontinued its Iqaluit to Kangerlussuaq flights. Air Greenland used Dash 8 aircraft on the run. After three years in place the service was discontinued for the 2015 season.\n\nAir Canada had operated service to Ottawa and Montreal from March 2010 to August 1, 2011.\n\nAir Baffin began as chartered service in 1989, as a schedule airline in 1992 and renamed as Air Nunavut in 1996.\n\nAir Greenland had operated service to Nuuk, Greenland in 2012, 2013 and 2014.\n\n\n"}

Its name is derived from UCMJ section VII (\"Trial Procedure\") Article 32 (10 U.S.C. § 832), which mandates the hearing.\n\nThe UCMJ specifies several different levels of formality with which infractions can be dealt. The most serious is a \"general court-martial\". An article 32 hearing is required before a defendant can be referred to a general court-martial, in order to determine whether there is enough evidence to merit a general court-martial. Offenders in the US military may face non-judicial punishment, a summary court-martial, special court-martial, general court-martial, or administrative separation. A commanding officer, in the role as court-martial convening authority, will consult with the command judge advocate for advice on case disposition; factors to be considered include, \"inter alia\", the relevant statutory and case law, the seriousness of the offenses, the strength or weakness of each element of the case, the promotion of good order and discipline, and the commander's desire for case disposition.\n\nAn investigation is normally directed when it appears the charges are of such a serious nature that trial by general court-martial may be warranted. The commander directing an investigation under Article 32 details a commissioned officer as investigating officer who will conduct the investigation and make a report of conclusions and recommendations. This officer is never the accuser, trial counsel (judge advocate prosecutor), nor in the accused's chain of command. This officer may or may not have any legal training, although the use of military attorneys (judge advocates) is recommended and common within service practice. If the investigating officer is not a lawyer, he or she may seek legal advice from an impartial source, but may not obtain such advice from counsel for any party.\n\nAn investigative hearing is scheduled as soon as reasonably possible after the investigating officer's appointment. The hearing is normally attended by the investigating officer, the accused and the defense counsel. The commander will ordinarily detail counsel to represent the United States, and in some cases a court reporter and an interpreter; these appointments are, in practical reality, duty assignments made by the criminal law branch of the command judge advocate's office. Ordinarily, this investigative hearing is open to the public and the media.\n\nThe investigating officer will, generally, review all non-testimonial evidence and then proceed to examination of witnesses. Except for a limited set of rules on privileges, interrogation, and the rape-shield rule (MRE 412), the military rules of evidence do not apply at this investigative hearing. This does not mean, however, that the investigating officer ignores evidentiary issues. The investigating officer will comment on all evidentiary issues that are critical to a case's disposition. All testimony is taken under oath or affirmation, except that an accused may make an unsworn statement.\n\nThe defense is given wide latitude in cross-examining witnesses. As of 2013 in cases where sexual assault is alleged some critics allege an extremely intrusive and aggressive cross examination of the victim is permitted, a practice which has been cited by critics of the military's handling of sexual assault in the United States military. In one case, a midshipman at the Navy Academy was interrogated for 30 hours over several days about their past sexual behavior. If the commander details an attorney to represent the United States, this government representative will normally conduct a direct examination of the government witnesses. This is followed by cross-examination by the defense and examination by the investigating officer upon completion of questioning by both counsel. Likewise, if a defense witness is called, the defense counsel will normally conduct a direct examination followed by a government cross-examination. After redirect examination by the defense counsel, or completion of questioning by both counsel, the investigating officer may conduct additional examination. The exact procedures to be followed in the hearing are not specified in either the Uniform Code of Military Justice or the Manual for Court-Martial.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1935496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935496", "title": "Film poster", "text": "Film poster\n\nA film poster is a poster used to promote and advertise a film primarily to persuade paying customers into a theater to see it. Studios often print several posters that vary in size and content for various domestic and international markets. They normally contain an image with text. Today's posters often feature printed likenesses of the main actors. Prior to the 1980s, illustrations instead of photos were far more common. The text on film posters usually contains the film title in large lettering and often the names of the main actors. It may also include a tagline, the name of the director, names of characters, the release date, and other pertinent details to inform prospective viewers about the film.\n\nFilm posters are often displayed inside and on the outside of movie theaters, and elsewhere on the street or in shops. The same images appear in the film exhibitor's pressbook and may also be used on websites, DVD (and historically VHS) packaging, flyers, advertisements in newspapers and magazines, and all other press related to the promotion of the film.\n\nFilm posters have been used since the earliest public exhibitions of film. They began as outside placards listing the programme of (short) films to be shown inside the hall or movie theater. By the early 1900s, they began to feature illustrations of a film scene or an array of overlaid images from several scenes. Other posters have used artistic interpretations of a scene or even the theme of the film, represented in a wide variety of artistic styles. Film posters have become increasingly coveted by art collectors in recent years due to their known relative rarity, condition, artist, and art historical significance.\n\nThe first poster for a specific film, rather than a \"magic lantern show\", was based on an illustration by Marcellin Auzolle to promote the showing of the Lumiere Brothers film \"L'Arroseur arrosé\" at the Grand Café in Paris on December 26, 1895.\n\nOriginally, film posters were produced for the exclusive use by the theaters exhibiting the film the poster was created for, and were required to be returned to the distributor after the film left the theater. In the United States, film posters were usually returned to a nationwide operation called the National Screen Service (NSS) which printed and distributed most of the film posters for the studios between 1940 and 1984. As an economy measure, the NSS regularly recycled posters that were returned, sending them back out to be used again at another theater. During this time, a film could stay in circulation for several years, and so many old film posters were badly worn before being retired into storage at an NSS warehouse (most often, they were thrown away when they were no longer needed or had become too worn to be used again). Those posters which were not returned were often thrown away by the theater owner or damaged by being outside.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, American film studios began taking over direct production and distribution of their posters from the National Screen Service and the process of making and distributing film posters became decentralized in that country. As Hollywood cinema was disseminated into foreign markets, distinct hand-painted film poster traditions arose in Poland, India, and Ghana, with depictions of posters often varying from their original Hollywood versions based on the artistry of local painters.\n\nAfter the National Screen Service ceased most of its printing and distribution operations in 1985, some of the posters which they had stored in warehouses around the United States ended up in the hands of private collectors and dealers. Today there is a thriving collectibles market in film posters, and some have become very valuable. The first auction by a major auction house solely of film posters occurred on December 11, 1990, when proceeds of a sale of 271 vintage posters run by Bruce Hershenson at Christie's totaled US$935,000. The record price for a single poster was set on November 15, 2005 when $690,000 was paid for a poster of Fritz Lang's 1927 film \"Metropolis\" from the Reel Poster Gallery in London. Other early horror and science fiction posters are known to bring extremely high prices as well, with an example from \"The Mummy\" realizing $452,000 in a 1997 Sotheby's auction, and posters from both \"Bride of Frankenstein\" and \"The Black Cat\" selling for $334,600 in Heritage auctions, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.\nOccasionally, rare film posters have been found being used as insulation in attics and walls. In 2011, 33 film posters, including a \"Dracula\" Style F one-sheet (shown right), from 1930-1931 were discovered in an attic in Berwick, Pennsylvania and auctioned for $502,000 in March 2012 by Heritage Auctions.\n\nOver the years, old Bollywood posters, mostly from Bombay, India, especially with hand-painted art, have become collectors' items. Ghanaian hand-painted movie posters from the tradition's Golden Age in the 1980s and 1990s have sold for tens of thousands of dollars and been exhibited in galleries and museums across the world.\n\nAs a result of market demand for paper posters, some of the more popular older film posters have been reproduced either under license or illegally. Although the artwork on paper reproductions is the same as originals, reproductions can often be distinguished by size, printing quality, and paper type. Several websites on the Internet offer \"authentication\" tests to distinguish originals from reproductions.\n\nOriginal film posters distributed to theaters and other poster venues (such as bus stops) by the movie studios are never sold directly to the public. However, most modern posters are produced in large quantities and often become available for purchase by collectors indirectly through various secondary markets such as eBay. Accordingly, most modern posters are not as valuable. However some recent posters, such as the \"Pulp Fiction\" \"Lucky Strike\" U.S. one sheet poster (recalled due to a dispute with the cigarette company), are quite rare.\n\nLobby cards are similar to posters but smaller, usually , also before 1930. Lobby cards are collectible and values depend on their age, quality, and popularity. Although typically issued in sets of eight, with each featuring a different scene from the film, some releases were, in unusual circumstances, promoted with larger (12 cards) or smaller sets (6 cards). The set for \"The Running Man\" (1963), for example, had only six cards, whereas the set for \"The Italian Job\" (1969) had twelve. Films released by major production companies experiencing financial difficulties often lacked lobby sets, such as \"Manhunter\" (1986).\n\nA Jumbo Lobby Card is larger, 14 in × 17 in (36 cm × 45 cm) and also issued in sets. Prior to 1940 studios promoted major releases with the larger card sets. In addition to the larger size, the paper quality was better (glossy or linen). The title card displays the movie title and top stars prominently.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, sets of lobby cards are known as \"Front of House\" cards. These, however, also refer to black-and-white press photographs, in addition to the more typical 8 × 10 inch promotional devices resembling lobby cards.\n\nThe Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University holds a collection of lobby cards from silent western films that date between 1910 and 1930.\n\nA teaser poster or advance poster is an early promotional film poster, containing a basic image or design without revealing too much information such as the plot, theme, and characters. The purpose is to incite awareness and generate hype for the film. A tagline may be included. There are some instances when teaser posters are issued long in advance before the film goes into production (teasers for cancelled projects are historically informative), although they are issued during the film development. Notable styles for teaser poster include:\n\nFor a film with an ensemble cast there may be a set of character posters, each featuring an individual character from the film. Usually it contains the name of the actor or the name of the character played. It may also include a tagline that reflects the quality of the character.\n\nFilm posters come in different sizes and styles depending on the country. The most common are listed below.\n\n\nThe following sizes were in common use in the United States prior to the mid-1980s, but have since been phased out of production:\n\n\n\n\nThe \"billing block\" is the list of names that adorn the bottom portion of the official poster (or 'one sheet', as it is called in the movie industry) of the movie\". A billing block can be seen at the bottom of Reynold Brown's poster from \"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\" (1958), which is reproduced below. In the layout of film posters and other film advertising copy, the billing block is usually set in a highly condensed typeface (one in which the height of characters is several times the width). By convention, the point size of the billing block is 25 or 35 percent of the average height of each letter in the title logo. Inclusion in the credits and the billing block is generally a matter of detailed contracts between the artists and the producer.

It is widely cultivated, and has been found to have naturalised in Asia, Africa, North America, New Zealand and South America. \"A. cultriformis\" grows to a height of about 4 m (13 ft) and has triangle-shaped phyllodes. The yellow flowers appear from August to November in its natural range. Its attractive foliage and bright flowers make it a popular garden plant.\n\nScottish botanist George Don described \"Acacia cultriformis\" in 1832, calling it the cultriform-leaved acacia. The species name relates to the knife-shaped phyllodes.\n\nQueensland botanist Les Pedley reclassified the species as \"Racosperma cultriforme\" in 2003, in his proposal to reclassify almost all Australian members of the genus into the new genus \"Racosperma;\" this name is treated as a synonym of its original name however.\n\nCommon names include knife-leaf (or -leaved) wattle, golden glow wattle, half-moon wattle or dog-tooth wattle.\n\n\"Acacia cultriformis\" is a woody shrub with an upright or spreading habit that grows to 4 m (13 ft) in height. Branchlets may be bare and smooth or covered with a white bloom. The mature trees do not have true leaves but have phyllodes that are crowded along the stems. The green to green-grey phyllodes are asymmetrical, with one leaf margin angled so the overall shape is triangular. They are 1–3 cm long by 0.6–1.5 cm wide. There is a nectary at the widest part of the phyllode. Flowering takes place from August to November, and can be prolific on upper parts of the plant. The rounded inflorescences are bright yellow and occur in groups of 2 to 25 in axillary 1–8 cm-long racemes. The later developing pods are straight or slightly curved, 3 to 10 cm long and 0.4 to 0.75 cm wide. They are flattish, with raised segments over the seeds. The oblong seeds themselves are 3.5 to 4.5 mm long, black and shiny, with a clavate (club-shaped) aril.\n\nThe related \"Acacia semilunata\" is similar in appearance but has hairy branchlets and narrower seed pods. \"Acacia pravissima\" can look similar but has a secondary longitudinal vein in its phyllodes.\n\n\"Acacia cultriformis\" is found in central New South Wales and southern Queensland on the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range, from Wagga Wagga and Narrandera northwards, and west of Denman and Singleton, to Stanthorpe and Inglewood. It grows in clay-loam or sandstone soils in \"Eucalyptus\" woodland, often on rocky ridges.\n\nIts bright flowers and attractive leaves make \"Acacia cultriformis\" one of the most popular wattles in cultivation. Adaptable to the garden, it is grown in a wide range of soils and can tolerate frosts. It grows in sun or part shade. Drought tolerant, it can be used to combat soil erosion. \"Acacia\" ‘Cascade’ (RN: ACC154) is a prostrate form that spreads to a diameter of 2 m (7 ft). It was registered on 18 November 1982, having been propagated by Bill Molyneux at his nursery in Montrose, Victoria from a selected seedling. It makes an attractive cascading plant in a rockery.\n\n\"A. cultriformis\" is used as cut flowers.\nThe flowers are edible and they are an ingredient used in some fritters. Yellow dye is extracted from the flowers and green dye is extracted from the seed pods.\n\n"}

It is an international airport located at the northern limits of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador that serves the St. John's metropolitan area and the Avalon Peninsula. The airport is part of the National Airports System, and is operated by St. John's International Airport Authority Inc.\n\nThe airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers at this airport can handle aircraft with no more than 165 passengers. However, they can handle up to 450 if the aircraft is unloaded in stages.\n\nConcern was expressed in the Canadian Parliament as early as September 1939 for the security of the Dominion of Newfoundland (which was not yet a part of Canada) in the event of a German raid or attack. It was felt that a permanent airfield defense facility was needed and as a result discussions were carried out among Canada, Newfoundland and the United Kingdom during 1940. In late 1940 the Canadian Government agreed to construct an air base near St. John's. Early in 1941, Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King informed Newfoundland Governor Sir Humphrey T. Walwyn of the intended location in Torbay. Newfoundland agreed, but stipulated that Canada was to assume all expenses and that the aerodrome not be used for civil purposes without first receiving Newfoundland's permission. The Canadian Government agreed, and in April 1941 McNamara Construction Company began construction on the runway. At a cost of approximately $1.5 million, a pair of runways, taxiways, aprons, hangars and other facilities were built and in operation by the end of 1941. The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) officially opened Torbay Airport on December 15, 1941. It was jointly used by the RCAF, Royal Air Force (RAF), and the United States Army Air Corps until December 1946.\n\nOn October 18, 1941, three American B-17 Flying Fortress and one RCAF Digby made the first unofficial landings on the only serviceable runway available. Later that month a British Overseas Airways Corporation B-24 Liberator en route from Prestwick, Scotland, to Gander, made the first sanctioned landing during a weather emergency. The first commercial air service at the facility went into operation on May 1, 1942 with the arrival at Torbay of a Trans-Canada Air Lines Lockheed Lodestar aircraft with five passengers and three crew. The first terminal building at the site was constructed in 1943. The small wooden structure was replaced by a larger brick building in 1958.\n\nIn approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as RCAF Aerodrome - Torbay, Newfoundland at with a variation of 29 degrees west and elevation of . The field was listed as \"All hard surfaced\" and had three runways listed as follows:\n\nIn 1954 a rescue unit was established, 107 Rescue Unit, by the RCAF to replace the existing detachment of the 103 Rescue Unit and would remain here until 1964.\n\n107 Rescue Unit hosted a few different aircraft to perform search and rescue operations:\n\n\nAlthough the airfield was not used as much as Argentia, Gander, Stephenville and Goose Bay airports in the movement of large numbers of aircraft to England, it was still quite busy. The Royal Air Force had its own squadron of fighters, surveillance and weather aircraft stationed there. The RCAF personnel strength on the station during the peak war years was well over 2000. Through an agreement between the US, Canadian and Newfoundland governments early in 1947, the United States Air Force (USAF) took over the use of the airport facilities and used about ten of the airport buildings. The US Military Air Transport Service (MATS) needed Torbay Airport in order to complete its assigned mission at that time. Maintenance of the airport and facilities was done by the Canadian Department of Transport.\n\nOn April 1, 1946, the airport became a civilian operation under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Department of Transport. Confusion was caused by the presence of American military personnel at a civilian airport operated by the Canadian government in a foreign country. Consequently, on 1 April 1953 control was returned to the Department of National Defence. On April 15, 1953 the RCAF Station at Torbay was reactivated and RCAF personnel started to move in and to provide the necessary administration and operation of the facility to support the mission of its co-tenant, the USAF. In early 1954 a rental agreement was signed between the USAF and the RCAF, and the USAF acquired use of additional buildings.\n\nThe control tower constructed during the war burned down in an extensive fire on March 17, 1946, which caused $1.5 million worth of damage. Construction was not begun on a new tower until 1951; it was opened in June 1952. A new Tower/Communications Building replaced that structure in March 1976. The tower was equipped with radio navigation and landing aids including precision approach radar, non-directional beacon and VHF omni-directional range.\n\nThe Transport Department maintained control over the terminal building. The facility remained RCAF Station Torbay until April 1, 1964, when it was returned to the jurisdiction of the Transport Department under the name St. John's Airport.\n\nSt. John's Airport is still commonly referred to as \"Torbay\" within the aviation community. For example, in aeronautical radio communications, air traffic controllers, flight dispatchers and pilots refer to the weather in \"Torbay\" and in flight clearances controllers commonly clear aircraft to or over St. John's with the phrase \"Cleared direct Torbay\". In the latter case this is a clearance to the VOR (VHF beacon) serving the region, which continues to be named Torbay on all official aeronautical charts. In addition to tradition, this usage avoids confusion with Saint John, New Brunswick, also in Atlantic Canada. Additionally the \"T\" in airport codes CYYT and YYT continues to reflect the Torbay origin.\n\nIn 1981 the terminal building housed the offices of the airport manager and staff. There were ticket offices for Eastern Provincial Airways, Air Canada, Gander Aviation and Labrador Airways, a large waiting area, a secure departure lounge, a self-serve restaurant, a licensed lounge, a number of food concessions and car rental facilities. In 1981 a small museum was prepared to house the story of aviation in Newfoundland and related memorabilia.\n\nThe airport underwent a $50 million renovation in 2002. The air terminal was completely renovated, expanded and modernized to meet the standards of other airport terminals its size across North America. The airport has undergone more renovations in 2016. In 2019, the airport plans to prepare of land to build an industrial park adjacent to the airport.\n\nThe airport was designated as one of five Canadian airports suitable as an emergency landing site for the Space Shuttle orbiter.\n\nFixed-base operators based at St. John's International Airport are Provincial Airlines and Cougar Helicopters.\n\nSt. John's International Airport Emergency Services is responsible for fire and rescue needs at the airport. Apparatus and crew are housed in a single fire station is located within the Combined Services Building.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1935504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935504", "title": "Functional integration (neurobiology)", "text": "Functional integration (neurobiology)\n\nFunctional integration is the study of how brain regions work together to process information and effect responses. Though functional integration frequently relies on anatomic knowledge of the connections between brain areas, the emphasis is on how large clusters of neurons – numbering in the thousands or millions – fire together under various stimuli. The large datasets required for such a whole-scale picture of brain function have motivated the development of several novel and general methods for the statistical analysis of interdependence, such as dynamic causal modelling and statistical linear parametric mapping. These datasets are typically gathered in human subjects by non-invasive methods such as EEG/MEG, fMRI, or PET. The results can be of clinical value by helping to identify the regions responsible for psychiatric disorders, as well as to assess how different activities or lifestyles affect the functioning of the brain.\n\nA study's choice of imaging modality depends on the desired spatial and temporal resolution. fMRI and PET offer relatively high spatial resolution, with voxel dimensions on the order of a few millimeters, but their relatively low sampling rate hinders the observation of rapid and transient interactions between distant regions of the brain. These temporal limitations are overcome by MEG, but at the cost of only detecting signals from much larger clusters of neurons.\n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a form of MRI that is most frequently used to take advantage of a difference in magnetism between oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin to assess blood flow to different parts of the brain. Typical sampling rates for fMRI images are in the tenths of seconds.\n\nMagnetoencephalography (MEG) is an imaging modality that uses very sensitive magnetometers to measure the magnetic fields resulting from ionic currents flowing through neurons in the brain. High-quality MEG machines allow for sub-millisecond sampling rates.\n\nPET works by introducing a radiolabeled biologically active molecule. The choice of molecule dictates what is visualized: by using a radiolabeled analog of glucose, for example, one can obtain an image whose intensity distribution indicates metabolic activity. PET scanners offer sampling rates in the tenths of seconds.\n\nMultimodal imaging frequently consists of the coupling of an electrophysiologic measurement technique, such as EEG or MEG, with a hemodynamic one such as fMRI or PET. While the intention is to use the strengths and limitations of each to complement the other, current approaches suffer from experimental limitations. Some previous work has focused on attempting to use the high spatial resolution of fMRI to determine the (spatial) origin of EEG/MEG signals, so that in future work this spatial information could be extracted from a unimodal EEG/MEG signal. While some studies have seen success in correlating signal origins between modalities to within a few millimeters, the results have not been uniformly positive. Another current limitation is the actual experimental setup: taking measurements using both modalities at once yields inferior signals, but the alternative of measuring each modality separately is confounded by trial-to-trial variability.\n\nIn functional integration, there is a distinction drawn between \"functional\" connectivity, and \"effective\" connectivity. Two brain regions are said to be functionally connected if there is a high correlation between the times that the two are firing, though this does not imply causality. Effective connectivity, on the other hand, is a description of the causal relationship between various brain regions.\n\nWhile statistical assessment of the functional connectivity of multiple brain regions is non-trivial, determining the causality of which brain regions influence which to fire is much thornier, and requires solutions to ill-posed optimization problems.\n\nDynamic causal modeling (DCM) is a Bayesian method for deducing the structure of a neural system based on the observed hemodynamic (fMRI) or electrophysiologic (EEG/MEG) signal. The first step is to make a prediction as to the relationships between the brain regions of interest, and formulate a system of ordinary differential equations describing the causal relationship between them, although many parameters (and relationships) will be initially unknown. Using previous results on how neural activity is known to translate into fMRI or EEG signals, one can take the measured signal and determine the likelihood that model parameters have particular values. The elucidated model can then be used to predict relationships between the considered brain regions under different conditions. A key factor to consider during the design of neuroimaging experiments involving DCM is the relationship between the timing of tasks or stimuli presented to the subject and the ability of DCM to determine the underlying relationships between brain regions, which is partially determined by the temporal resolution of the imaging modality in use.\n\nStatistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a method for determining whether the activation of a particular brain region changes between experimental conditions, stimuli, or over time. The essential idea is simple, and consists of two major steps: first, one performs a univariate statistical test on \"each individual voxel\" between each experimental condition. Second, one analyzes the clustering of the voxels that show statistically significant differences, and determines which brain regions exhibit different levels of activation under different experimental conditions.\n\nThere is great flexibility in the choice of statistical test (and thus the questions that an experiment can be designed to answer), and common choices include the Student's t test or linear regression. An important consideration with SPM, however, is that the large number of comparisons requires one to control the false positive rate with a more stringent significance threshold. This can be done either by modifying the initial statistical test to decrease the α value so as to make it harder for a particular voxel to exhibit a significant difference (e.g., Bonferroni correction), or by modifying the clustering analysis in the second step by only considering a brain region's activation to be significant if it contains a certain number of voxels that exhibit a statistical difference (see random field theory).\n\nVoxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a method that allows one to measure brain tissue composition differences between subjects. To do so, one must first register all images to a standard coordinate system, by mapping them to a reference image. This is done by use of an affine transformation that minimizes the sum-of-squares intensity difference between the experimental image and the reference. Once this is done, the proportion of grey or white matter in a voxel can be determined by intensity. This allows one to compare the tissue composition of corresponding brain regions between different subjects.\n\nThe ability to visualize whole-brain activity is frequently used in comparing brain function during various sorts of tasks or tests of skill, as well as in comparing brain structure and function between different groups of people.\n\nMany previous fMRI studies have seen that spontaneous activation of functionally connected brain regions occurs during the resting state, even in the absence of any sort of stimulation or activity. Human subjects presented with a visual learning task exhibit changes in functional connectivity in the resting state for up to 24 hours and dynamic functional connectivity studies have even shown changes in functional connectivity during a single scan. By taking fMRI scans of subjects before and after the learning task, as well as on the following day, it was shown that the activity had caused a resting-state change in hippocampal activity. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that the hippocampus also exhibited a new level of effective connectivity with the striatum, though there was no learning-related change in any visual area. Combining fMRI with DCM on subjects performing a learning task allows one to delineate which brain systems are involved in various sorts of learning, whether implicit or explicit, and document for long these tasks lead to changes in resting-state brain activation.\n\nVoxel-based morphometric measurements of grey matter localization in the brain can be used to predict components of IQ. A set of 35 teenagers were tested for IQ and were fMRI scanned over the course of 3.5 years, and had their IQ predicted by the level of grey matter localization. This study was well-conducted, but studies of this sort frequently suffer from \"double-dipping,\" where a single dataset is used both to identify the brain regions of interest \"and\" to develop a predictive model, which leads to overtraining of the model and an absence of real predictive power.\n\nThe study authors avoided double-dipping by using a \"leave-one-out\" methodology, that involves building a predictive model for each of the n members of a sample based on data from the other n-1 members. This ensures that the model is independent of the subject whose IQ is being predicted, and resulted in a model capable of explaining 53% of the change in verbal IQ as a function of grey matter density in the left motor cortex. The study also observed the previously-reported phenomenon that a ranking of young subjects by IQ does not stay constant as the subjects age, which confounds any measurement of the efficacy of educational programs.\n\nThese studies can be cross-validated by attempting to locate and assess patients with lesions or other damage in the identified brain region, and examining whether they exhibit functional deficits relative to the population. This methodology would be hindered by the lack of a \"before\" baseline measurement, however.\n\nThe phonological loop is a component of working memory that stores a small set of words that can be maintained indefinitely if not distracted. The concept was proposed by the psychologists Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch to explain how phrases or sentences can be internalized and used to direct action.\nBy using statistical parametric mapping to assess differences in cerebral blood flow between participants performing two different tasks, Paulescu et al. were able to identify the storage of the phonological loop as in the supramarginal gyrii. Human subjects were first split into a control and experimental group. The control group was presented with letters in a language they did not understand, and non-linguistic visual diagrams. The experimental group was tasked with two activities: the first activity was to remember a string of letters, and was intended activate all elements of the phonological loop. The second activity asked participants to assess whether given phrases rhymed, and was intended to only activate certain sub-systems involved in vocalization, but specifically not the phonological storage.\n\nBy comparing the first experimental task to the second, as well as to the control group, the study authors observed that the brain region most significantly activated by the task requiring phonological storage was the supramarginal gyrii. This result was backed up by previous literature observations of functional deficits in patients with damage in this area.\n\nThough this study was able to precisely localize a specific function anatomically and the methods of functional integration and imaging are of great value in determining the brain regions involved in certain information processing tasks, the low-level neural circuitry that gives rise to these phenomena remains mysterious.\n\nAlthough fMRI studies of schizophrenic and bipolar patients have yielded some insight into the changes in effective connectivity caused by these diseases, a comprehensive understanding of the functional remodelling that occurs has not yet been achieved.\n\nMontague et al. note that the almost \"unreasonable effectiveness of psychotropic medication\" has somewhat stymied progress in this field, and advocate for a large-scale \"computational phenotyping\" of psychiatric patients. Neuroimaging studies of large numbers of these patients could yield brain activation markers for specific psychiatric illnesses, and also aid in the development of therapeutics and animal models. While a true baseline of brain function in psychiatric patients is near-impossible to obtain, reference values can still be measured by comparing images gathered from patients before and after treatment.\n\n\n"}

The old worker homes where sold out and used as summer houses.\n\nA number of houses on one of the islands have (since 1953) been used by KFUM (the Swedish YMCA).

He is the cousin of professional wrestler Juan Conrado Aguilar, known as El Texano and the uncle of Aguilar's sons who wrestle as El Texano Jr. and Súper Nova. While he had a retirement tour in 2014, Gutiérrez has wrestled as recent as March 2019. Gutiérrez has wrestled for most major Mexican promotions, including Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre, Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide, Universal Wrestling Association, World Wrestling Association, and International Wrestling Revolution Group. In addition, he's worked for the US-based World Championship Wrestling as well as the Japanese Super World Sports and the International Wrestling Association of Japan. \n\nDuring his career, starting in 1981, he has won a number of championships including the CMLL World Middleweight Championship three times, the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship, the NWA World Welterweight Championship twice, the Mexican National Featherweight Championship, Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship twice, Mexican National Middleweight Championship, Mexican National Welterweight Championship, the WWA World Light Heavyweight Championship, and the WWA World Tag Team Championship Corazón de León. He was a part of a tag team that was known as \"Los Fabulosos\" with Silver King and a member of the Latino World Order group in World Championship Wrestling. A 2004 match against L.A. Park was voted \"Box y Lucha\" magazines \"Match of the year\".\n\nGutiérrez began training for a wrestling career at the age of 14, training under Diablo Velazco in his hometown of Guadalajara, Jalisco. After five years of training he finally, reluctantly, made his in-ring debut. Gutiérrez later stated that he was nervous for his debut in part because of his fear of the public. He opted to use the ring name \"El Dandy\", after several of the wrestlers in Guadalajara gave him the nickname due to his success with women. He made his debut as an \"enmascarado\", or masked wrestler, teaming with Águila Solitaria against Black Indian and Chamaco Hernández. A local promoter asked Gutiérrez if he would prefer to wrestle unmasked instead, leading to Gutiérrez to lose the mask and wrestle unmasked for the remainder of his career. At the time his family did not know he had become a professional wrestler, not until they saw him on TV against El Dorado. While the match was so well received that the fans in the arena threw money in the ring, Gutiérrez's parents were not enthused with his career choice at the time.\n\nAfter showing his skills in Guadalajara, representatives from Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), Mexico's largest professional wrestling promotion invited him to Mexico City to work for EMLL. Gutiérrez credited Mocho Cota and Herodes for getting him to Mexico City and also taking him under their wings. Early in his EMLL career, Gutiérrez had to wash clothes for several wrestlers to earn enough money to eat.\n\nEl Dandy won his first Championship on July 31, 1982 as he defeated El Modulo to win the Mexican National Featherweight Championship. His reign lasted 175 days, ended when Pequeño Solin defeated him on January 22, 1983. Two weeks after losing the championship, El Dandy won his first \"Lucha de Apuestas\" (\"Bet match\") against El Guerrero and as a result of the match, El Guerrero was shaved bald. In Lucha libre a \"Lucha de Apuestas\" victory is considered more prestigious than championship wins. The following year, on December 6, El Dandy defeated Gran Cochisse in a \"Lucha de Apuestas\", continuing his rise up the ranks of CMLL. By late 1984 El Dandy began teaming with Fuerza Guerrera and Talisman on a regular basis, forming a trio known as \"Los Bravos\" (\"The Brave\"). \"Los Bravos\" defeated \"Los Destructores\" (Lemús II, Tony Arce, and Vulcano) in a \"Lucha de Apuestas\", winning the mask of Lemus II and the hair of Arce and Vulcano). On September 1, 1985, EMLL decided to have El Dandy defeat Américo Rocca to win the Mexican National Welterweight Championship. 77 days later, El Dandy won the NWA World Welterweight Championship, and in the process gave up the lower ranking Mexican National title. His 141-day reign was ended by Javier Cruz, as part of a long-running storyline feud between the two. El Dandy regained the championship on August 24, holding it for 70 days before losing it to Américo Rocca.\n\nAfter competing as a welterweight for years, a weight class with a max limit, El Dandy moved up to the middleweight division with an top weight. On July 17, 1987, he defeated Kung Fu to win the NWA World Middleweight Championship. After his title win, El Dandy became involved in a storyline with another middleweight competitor, El Satánico. El Satánico cost El Dandy the championship, helping Kung Fu cheat to regain the championship as part of the build to a \"Lucha de Apuestas\" match between the two. In the lead up to the anticipated match, El Dandy defeated Satánico to win the Mexican National Middleweight Championship on September 28. Weeks later El Satánico defeated El Dandy, making him the first wrestler to pin El Dandy in a \"Lucha de Apuestas\" match. El Dandy's reign as Mexican National Middleweight Champion lasted 112 days, until Javier Cruz won the championship.\n\nIn June 1990, El Dandy defeated Ángel Azteca to become the NWA World Middleweight Champion for a second time, holding it for 61 days until Atlantis won the title from him. The storyline between El Dandy and El Satánico was once again brought to the forefront in late 1990, with El Dandy evening the score between them by defeating El Satánico as part of the 1990 \"Juicio Final\" supercard show. The following year, El Satánico defeated El Dandy in their third overall \"Lucha de Apuestas\", followed by El Dandy winning at the CMLL 59th Anniversary Show, to even the score of two-all in \"Lucha de Apuestas\" matches. In 1992, EMLL changed its name to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL; World Wrestling Council) and created various CMLL championships. After having won both the NWA World and Mexican National championships in the middleweight division, El Dandy defeated Negro Casas to win the recently created CMLL World Middleweight Championship. The reign was ended by Bestia Salvaje on September 4, 1992. El Dandy regained the championship in December, with his second reign as CMLL World Middleweight Champion lasting until May 1993. El Dandy had a third reign that started on October 5 and lasted until February 22, 1994 when he lost it to Javier Llanes.\n\nNext, El Dandy moved into the light heavyweight division, defeating Jaque Mate to win the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship. In 1996, El Dandy won two \"Lucha de Apuestas\" matches, first winning the hair of Babe Face on August 1, and then Chicaco Express on September 3. The following month, on October 15, El Dandy's 681-day reign as NWA World Light Heavyweight Champion was ended by Black Warrior. While 1996 started with success, it ended with a \"Lucha de Apuestas\" loss to El Hijo del Santo in the main event of the 1996 \"Juicio Final\" show. El Dandy later competed in a tournament for the vacant CMLL World Trios Championship teaming up with Héctor Garza and Vampiro Canadiense. The trio defeated Apolo Dantés, Gran Markus Jr., and Fuerza Guerrera in the first round, before losing to Bestia Salvaje, Scorpio Jr., and Zumbido in the semifinals of the tournament.\n\nWhile working for CMLL El Dandy also worked for the World Wrestling Association (WWA) in Tijuana, Baja California, as he was allowed to take independent bookings on days where he was not needed for CMLL shows. El Dandy and Corazón de León defeated \"Los Cowboys\" (El Texano and Silver King to win the WWA Tag Team Championship on July 21, 1993. Their reign lasted 42 days before \"Los Cowboys\" regained the championship. El Dandy returned to WWA in 2001, teaming with Silver King to win the WWA World Tag Team Championship for a second time, defeating Los Brazos (Brazo de Oro and Brazo de Plata) on November 10, 2000. He would also defeat La Parka to win the WWA World Light Heavyweight Championship in early 2001. El Dandy ended up losing both championships on June 17, as Antifaz and La Parka won the tag team championship and Asterico won the light heavyweight title. He won the WWA World Tag Team Championship for a third time, teaming with Rey Misterio to win the vacant title on August 27, 2007. The team later vacated the championship for reasons that have not been made public.\n\nIn 1997, El Dandy began working for the US-based World Championship Wrestling (WCW) along with a number of other Mexican wrestlers. His WCW televised debut took place on September 28, 1997, where he and Damian lost to nWo Japan representatives The Great Muta and Masahiro Chono. His first pay-per-view (PPV) show match was as part of the 60-man battle royal main event of WCW's annual World War 3 show. He would later unsuccessfully challenge fellow Mexican luchador Juventud Guerrera for the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship in January 1998. For his next PPV match, El Dandy, La Parka, Psicosis, and Silver King lost to Chavo Guerrero Jr., Juventud Guerrera, Lizmark Jr., and Super Caló at Souled Out.\n\nFor the 1998 Slamboree show, El Dandy was one of 15 wrestlers involved in a battle royal where the winner of the match would face Chris Jericho for the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship immediately afterward. During his introductions Jericho referred to El Dandy as the \"winner of the Lou Ferrigno look-a-like contest\". Later that year, Dandy was a member of the Latino World Order, a group of Mexican wrestlers led by Eddie Guerrero. Shortly after Guerrero's real-life car accident on New Year's Day, however, the group was forced to disband by the reformed nWo. The following year, El Dandy lost to Lenny as he challenged for the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship. El Dandy's most notable accomplishments did not come in the ring, but instead came from an interview from Bret Hart. The heel Hart had selected El Dandy as his opponent, leading to interviewer Gene Okerlund questioning why Hart selected such an easy opponent. This led to Hart stating \"Who are you to doubt El Dandy\", which later became an online meme. \nIn early 2000, El Dandy and Silver King became a regular tag team, dubbed Los Fabulosos: \"the hottest men in Latin America\", playing off the fact that they were not \"traditionally handsome\". The two were teamed up with manager Stacy Kiebler. On March 21, 2000 Los Fabulosos defeated XS (Lane and Rave) in their first televised match under that name. They later ended up losing to Harlem Heat 2000 (Big T and Stevie Ray) in El Dandy's last match with WCW.\n\nReturning to Mexico, El Dandy generally worked for various independent promotions all over Mexico, mixed in with stints for IWRG and AAA. On October 15, 2004 he lost the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship to L.A. Park. Five months later, El Dandy regained the championship from L.A. Park. His second reign lasted 750 days until Vangelis won the title on April 15, 2007. In Aril 2009, El Dandy lost a match for the NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship to titleholder Blue Demon Jr. Later that same year, El Dandy defeated El Signo in a 7-man steel cage \"Lucha de Apuestas\" match. The match also included El Fantasma, El Oriental, Super Muñeco, Villano III, and Villano IV, and saw El Dandy pin El Signo to force El Signo to be shaved bald.\n\nIn 2014, El Dandy began his retirement tour, facing off against his long time rival El Satánico on various local shows around the country. The long-time rivals split the first four matches between them, leading to \"El Juicio Final\" on May 18. EL Dandy won the match, which meant that El Satánico was shaved bald. 12 days later, in what was billed as his last match, El Dandy defeated Satánico one more time. While the 2014 tour was meant to be his retirement, El Dandy returned to the ring in 2015, working a CMLL match alongside Negro Casas, defeating El Satánico and Mr. Niebla. He would also work a limited schedule, with four matches in 2016, one in 2017, and one in 2019.\n\nAfter returning from his stint in WCW, El Dandy began working for the Naucalpan, State of Mexico based International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG). His first IWRG match took place on July 6, 2000, and saw El Dandy, Ciclon Ramirez, Kato Kung Lee, and Super Parka lose to Bombero Infernal, Dr. Cerebro, Mosco de la Merced, and Super Crazy. He later challenged Scorpio Jr. for the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship but lost the match. While in IWRG, he defended the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship on two occasions, against Negro Casas on July 24, 2003, and against Blue Panther on August 31, 2003. He was one of eight wrestlers who put his hair on the line in a multi-man \"Lucha de Apuestas\" match; Suicida lost the match and his hair. On March 18, 2007, El Dandy was involved in a steel cage match where both his light heavyweight championship and the IWRG Intercontinental Welterweight Championship were on the line. In the end Fantasma de la Ópera defeated Dr. Cerebro to win the IWRG title. His last match with the group took place a week later, as Damián 666, Misterioso Jr., and Villano III defeated El Dandy, El Sagrado, and Máscara Sagrada by disqualification.\n\nIn 2002, El Dandy began working for AAA for the first time in his career, making his debut for the company on May 5, 2002. He was soon written into a storyline rivalry with Perro Aguayo Jr. as the two clashed against each other on multiple occasions. Both rivals, as well as Máscara Sagrada and Máscara Maligna faced off in a steel cage match where the last person in the ring would either be forced to unmask or have their hair shaved off. Neither Dandy nor Aguayo were involved in the finish, watching from outside of the ring as Máscara Maligna lost and was unmasked. Two weeks later, El Dandy defeated Perro Aguayo Jr. to win the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship. The storyline came to an end in the main event of the 2002 Verano de Escándalo show, where Dandy, Aguayo, Electroshock and El Zorro faced off in a four way \"Lucha de Apuestas\" match. In the end, Perro Aguayo Jr. pinned El Dandy, forcing El Dandy to be shaved bald as a result. EL Dandy's last match, a victory over El Hijo del Santo, took place on May 11, 2003.\n\nAt one point in Gutiérrez he suffered a serious back injury that left him unable to perform for a while. After the spinal injury left him unable to compete, Gutiérrez contemplated suicide on more than one occasion, especially as few of his fellow wrestlers kept in contact with him during his hard times. In the end he turned to therapy to help, becoming a therapist. In early 2020, his name was mentioned as a new member of the Mexico City boxing and lucha libre commission, assisting the commission in enforcing their rules and statutes.\n\nDuring El Dandy's days in EMLL, Wrestling Observer Newsletter founder Dave Meltzer stated that El Dandy was one of the \"three best workers\" in EMLL. In 1997, Pro Wrestling Illustrated (PWI) ranked him at #167 in their \"top 500\" for the year. Writer Matt Farmer stated that El Dandy was \"highly underrated\" and that he had \"Phenomenal matches\" with Perro Aguayo Jr. during their 2002 feud. His 2004 match against L.A. Park was voted the \"Match of the year\" by the readers of \"Box y Lucha\" magazine.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1935539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935539", "title": "Governing Body Commission", "text": "Governing Body Commission\n\nThe Governing Body Commission (GBC) is the managerial authority of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). ISKCON's founder, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, created the GBC in 1970 and since then it has met on an annual basis, usually in Mayapur, India.\n\nThe GBC is entrusted with both spiritual and secular leadership of the ISKCON communities, as well as the power to appoint new gurus. According to a GBC confidence survey, \"those holding critical views of the GBC were far less committed to ISKCON.\" In February 2009, Romapada Swami was elected GBC Chairman, succeeding Ramai Swami.\n\nAccording to the letter of 28 July 1970 A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appointed the following members to the Governing Body Commission.\n\nThis letter outlines the following purposes of the commission:\n\nShortly after establishing the GBC, Prabhupada asked his newly appointed leaders to renounce the everyday world and become \"sannyasis\" (renunciate monks), indicating that those who set policy would not be involved with financial dealings. However, after Prabhupada's death some GBC members adopted lavish lifestyles. A number of schisms tested the notion of the supreme authority of the GBC. Some of these scandals involved GBC members Hans Kary (Hansadutta) and James Immel (Jayatirtha), as well as one of the leaders of the New Vrindaban community, Keith Ham (Kirtanananda), who surrounded himself with opulence and declared himself the only true successor to Prabhupada.\n\nIn 1982 the GBC began the slow process of adding new gurus to the original eleven. In 1983 the GBC was announced to be the highest ecclesiastical authority of ISKCON. In 1985 the decision was made to lower the standard of living for ISKCON leadership. After much heated discussion, the GBC decided to \"relieve\" a number of leaders and new leaders were selected. The young leaders of the GBC sought the advice of one of Prabhupada's Gaudiya Math godbrothers, and endeavored to become more integrated in the broader Hindu community.\n\nAfter years of discussion and reforms, a general consensus emerged to accept women as leaders and initiators in ISKCON, overriding the former GBC supposition that \"unprotected, 'women leaders become subject to various forms of mistreatment and abuse'\". In 1998 Malati Devi Dasi became the first woman appointed to the GBC. The second woman leader, Dina Sharana, was selected in 2009. However, a similar proposal had been discussed years previously.\n\nCurrent or former GBC members include: Bhakti Caitanya Swami, Bhakti Caru Swami, Bhakti Tirtha Swami, Bhaktisvarupa Damodar Swami, Giriraja Swami, Gopala Krishna Goswami, Hansadutta Swami, Hridaya Caitanya Dasa, Hridayananda Dasa Goswami, Jayatirtha Dasa, Jayapataka Swami, Kirtanananda Swami, Malati Dasi, Mukunda Goswami, Radhanath Swami, Ramesvara Swami, Ravindra Svarupa Dasa, Romapada Swami, Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami, Sivarama Swami, Tamala Krishna Goswami, Devamrita Swami and others listed below:\n\nWas initiated by Srila Prabhupada in 1976 and since 1993 has served as Director of Communications for ISKCON in North America. He is also a member of the faculty at Bhaktivedanta College.\n\nWas the commission's chairman in 2005, and now serves as the editor in chief of the Dandavats Vaishnava news agency.\n\nWas born Philip Burbank in 1949, in Buffalo, New York. In January 1969, while studying at the University at Buffalo, he joined ISKCON and the same year was initiated by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, receiving the name Prahladananda Dasa. In 1975 he joined the Radha-Damodara preaching bus tour, organised by Tamala Krishna Goswami and Vishnujana Swami. In 1982 he took sannyasa and in 1986 he became one of the initiating gurus in ISKCON. In 1989 he became a member the Vaisnava Institute for Higher Education, in Vrndavana. In 1990 he was appointed to head the Governing Body Commission's committee of Health and Welfare. In 1991, the GBC also made him the head of sannyasa ministry.\n\nWas chairman of the Governing Body Commission in 2008. Ramai Swami started the first Hare Krishna Food for Life program, at the ISKCON temple in Sydney, Australia. It was called ISKCON Food Relief and was operated through the back entrance of the Sydney Hare Krishna temple.\n\n\n"}

It is part of the National Airports System, and is owned and operated by the Government of Yukon. The airport was renamed in honour of longtime Yukon Member of Parliament Erik Nielsen on December 15, 2008. The terminal handled 294,000 passengers in 2012, representing a 94% increase in passenger traffic since 2002. By 2017, this number had risen to 366,000. Air North is based in Whitehorse.\n\nBuilt between 1940 and 1941 by the federal Department of Transport, it was transferred to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in 1942 as part of the Northwest Staging Route under the name of RCAF Station Whitehorse. It was closed in 1968 and the airfield resumed its status as a civilian airport.\n\nThe airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers at this airport can handle aircraft with no more than 50 passengers; however, they can handle up to 225 if the aircraft is unloaded in stages.\n\nThe airport has two fixed-base operators for fuel, limited aircraft maintenance facilities. The control tower operates from 7 a.m. – 9 p.m. local time, and the Whitehorse Flight Service Station provides Airport Advisory Service during the remaining hours. ARFF services are also provided 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nIn addition to scheduled commercial service, numerous small air charter operators and bush pilots use the airport and it serves as a major base for water bombers used in forest firefighting operations. The airport also controls Whitehorse Water Aerodrome, a float plane base on Schwatka Lake.\n\nDuring the September 11 attacks, two aircraft approaching the United States from Asia were diverted to Whitehorse as part of Operation Yellow Ribbon. One of these flights, a Boeing 747 operating as Korean Air Flight 85, was feared to be hijacked; this was not the case as the jumbo jet was low on fuel. Many of the buildings in the downtown area near the airport were evacuated as a precaution. Those who witnessed the landing by the Korean Air 747 observed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) order the flight crew out at gunpoint.\n\nThe airport's parking lot is graced by an old Canadian Pacific Air Lines Douglas DC-3 on a pedestal that serves as a weather vane.\n\nCommencing in the early 1940s, scheduled passenger service was operated by Canadian Pacific Air Lines. Canadian Pacific and its successor, CP Air, provided service to Vancouver, British Columbia; Edmonton, Alberta; Prince George, British Columbia; Fort St. John, British Columbia; Fort Nelson, British Columbia and Watson Lake, Yukon. Other destinations in the Yukon as well as Fairbanks, Alaska were also served by Canadian Pacific during the mid-1940s with these flights subsequently being discontinued. CP Air served Whitehorse during the 1970s with Boeing 737-200 jetliners with direct, no change of plane flights to all of the above named destinations in Canada. Other Canadian Pacific flights into the airport over the years were earlier operated with such twin engine prop aircraft as the Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar, Douglas DC-3, Convair 240, and also with larger, four engine Douglas DC-4 and DC-6B prop aircraft as well as Bristol Britannia turboprops. CP Air was subsequently acquired by Pacific Western Airlines with the combined air carriers then operating as Canadian Airlines International which in turn continued to serve Whitehorse with Boeing 737 jet service into the 1990s before this air carrier was acquired by Air Canada in 2000. Pacific Western had previously served the airport with nonstop Boeing 737-200 jet service to Edmonton, Prince George (with this flight continuing on to Vancouver) and Yellowknife, NWT (with this flight continuing on to Winnipeg) operated at various times during the early and mid 1980s. During the mid and late 1970s, the airport was also served by Winnipeg-based Transair (Canada) which operated Boeing 737-200 and Fokker F28 twin jet service direct to Winnipeg several days a week via intermediate stops at Yellowknife and Churchill, Manitoba. Transair was also subsequently acquired by Pacific Western Airlines. Another air carrier which served Whitehorse during the early and mid 1970s was International Jetair operating nonstop flights to Inuvik on the weekdays with continuing one stop service several days a week to Fort Nelson flown with Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop aircraft.\n\nU.S.-based Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) served Whitehorse during the early 1960s as part of a route linking Seattle with Alaska. Pan Am operated Douglas DC-4 followed by Douglas DC-6B propliners into the airport on a routing of Seattle-Ketchikan-Juneau-Whitehorse-Fairbanks-Galena-Nome.\n\nSeveral Alaska-based airlines also served Whitehorse in the past. During the 1970s, Wien Air Alaska operated Boeing 737-200 jetliners as well as Fairchild F-27 turboprops into the airport with Anchorage-Fairbanks-Whitehorse-Juneau routings. Era Aviation operated Convair 580 turboprop aircraft nonstop between Anchorage and Whitehorse during the 1980s.\n\nThe airport has its own fire department with three crash tenders and one supervisor vehicle based at a fire station on the airport grounds.\n\n\n"}

He is arguably one of the most enigmatic figures in World prehistory and mythology. Historically, Krishna as Vasudeva Govinda Krishna Shauri of the Vrishnis\"' was the monarch of Dwaraka, a submerged island-state off coast modern Gujarat, India. In the Hindu Pantheon Krishna is recognized as \"the complete and eighth avatar of the God Vishnu\" or as the Supreme God \"swayam bhagwan\" (supreme personality of godhead) in his own right. Krishna is one of the most widely revered and popular of all Hindu deities. As one of the most popular of all Hindu deities, Krishna has absorbed many regionally significant deities such as Jagannatha in Odisha or Vithoba in Maharashtra. Srimad Bhagavatam names Krishna's eternal abode as \"Goloka\". He is often described as a child, an infant eating butter, a toddler being tied to a mortar (Damodara) by his Mother, a young boy playing a flute as in the \"Bhagavata Purana\" (a.k.a. Srimad Bhagavatam), an adolescent cowherd tending to cows, a young man along with Radha (), a householder romancing any of his multiple wives, a king dispensing royal duties, a diplomat initiating both war and peace for greater good, as a middle-aged friend and charioteer to Arjuna or as an elder giving direction and guidance to Arjuna in the form of Spiritual discourse as in the \"Bhagavad Gita\". In Bagwat Gita (4:13) Krishna says, \"Chatur varnyam maya srishtam\" meaning that Krishna himself created the caste system (varnashrama dharma).The stories of Krishna appear across a broad spectrum of Hindu philosophical and theological traditions. They portray him in various perspectives: a lovable infant, a god-child, a prankster, a cowherd, a model lover, a divine hero, a Diplomat, a King, a Kingmaker, a selfless friend, a philosopher and the Supreme Being swayam bhagwan. The principal scriptures discussing Krishna's story are the \"Mahabharata\", the \"Harivamsa\", the \"Bhagavata Purana\", and the \"Vishnu Purana\". The \"Vishnu Sahasranama\", the list of Vishnu's thousand names also includes many of the above-mentioned names including Sri Krishna.\n\nAccording to aryabhatt.com, the 108 names of Krishna include:\n\n\n"}

Puthoff, of remote viewing, and specifically the Stargate Project.\n\nSwann was a claimed psychic who called himself a \"consciousness researcher who had sometimes experienced altered states of 'consciousness'\". He said, \"I don't get 'tested', I only work with researchers on well-designed experiments.\" According to Russell Targ and Harold E. Puthoff, \"Swann-inspired innovations\" have led to impressive results in parapsychology. Indeed, experiments not controlled by Swann have not been successful, and they are rarely mentioned, and if so, only in passing.\n\nSwann researched the process of remote viewing at the Stanford Research Institute in experiments that caught the attention of the Central Intelligence Agency. He is commonly credited with proposing the idea of \"controlled remote viewing\", a process in which viewers would view a location given nothing but its geographical coordinates, which was developed and tested by Puthoff and Targ with CIA funding. Remote viewing is the practice of seeking impressions about a distant or unseen target, purportedly using extrasensory perception (ESP) or \"sensing\" with the mind. There is no scientific evidence that remote viewing exists, and the topic is regarded as pseudoscience.\n\nDue to the popularity of Uri Geller in the seventies, a critical examination of Swann's paranormal claims was basically overlooked by skeptics and historians. Uri Geller commented very favorably on Swann, saying, \"If you were blind and a man appeared who could teach you to see with mind power, you would revere him as a guru. So why is Ingo Swann ignored by publishers and forced to publish his astounding life story on the Internet?\"\n\nBoth Geller and Swann were tested by two experimenters, Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, who concluded that they did indeed have unique skills. Others have strongly disputed the scientific validity of Targ and Puthoff's experiments. In a 1983 interview, magician Milbourne Christopher remarked that Swann was \"one of the cleverest in the field\".\n\nIn 1972 in the newsletter of the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR), their director of research Karlis Osis described his personal controlled out-of-body (OOB) experiment with Swann. The targets that Swann was to attempt to describe and illustrate were on a shelf two feet from the ceiling and several feet above Swann's head. Osis does not describe the height of the ceiling. Swann suggests, the ceiling was 14 feet in height. The room was illuminated by two kitchen-style overhead fixtures. Swann sat alone in the chamber with wires from electrodes fastened to his head running through the wall behind him. Swann sat just beneath the target tray. He was given a clipboard to use for sketching. Any movement while drawing did not result in \"artifacts\" in the brain readout. In Swann's book \"To Kiss Earth Goodbye\" there is a photograph of the objects on the shelf. Swann wrote that he was aware of most of the objects on shelf above his head, but he did not know it held four numbers on a side that would \"not\" have been visible if a reflecting surface had been angled near the end.\n\nPsychological scales were developed for rating the quality and clarity (as subjectively described) by Swann of his OOB vision, which varied from time to time. The results were evaluated by blind judging. A psychologist, either Bonnie Preskari or Carole K. Silfen, was asked to match up Swann's responses without knowing for which target they were meant. She matched all the eight sessions. Osis stressed the odds about Swann being correct were forty thousand to one. There is no record of any experiments being performed in the dark.\n\nTogether, Silfen and Swann prepared an unofficial report of later out-of-body experiments and circulated it to 500 members of the ASPR, before the ASPR board was aware of it. According to Swann, Silfen has disappeared and cannot be located. He was searching for her and was asking for the public's help. According to Swann, in April 1972 a move was made at the ASPR in New York to discredit him and throw him out, because he was a Scientologist.\n\nWhen Swann arrived at SRI, Harold Puthoff decided he would first be tested for PK. On June 6, 1972, the two men paid a visit to Dr. Arthur Heberd and his quark detector, a magnetometer, at the Varian Physics Building. The well-shielded magnetometer had a small magnetic probe in a vault five feet beneath the floor. The oscillation had been running silently for about an hour, tracing out a stable pattern on the chart recorder. Putoff asked Swann if he could affect the magnetometer's magnetic field. Swann said he focused his attention on the interior of the magnetometer and was getting nothing.\n\nThen there are different versions of the following events. Puthoff states that after about a five-second delay, Heberd says it was a ten- to fifteen-minute delay, the frequency of the trace recorder oscillation doubled for about 30 seconds, reportedly a common occurrence due to variations in the shared helium line to the laboratory. Heberd continues, when the curve burped, Swann asked, \"Is that what I am supposed to do?\" Swann said he responded,\"is that an effect?\" Then according to Heberd, Swann crossed the room taking his attention away from the chart recorder. Swann said he took his mind off the machine and was sketching. Others watched the recorder to see if the irregularity would be repeated, and it was. Puthoff asked Swann, \"Did you do \"that\" too?\" Swann said he again responded, \"Is that an effect?\" According to Puthoff, Swann said he was then tired and couldn't \"hold it any longer\" and let go. The chart recorder pattern returned to normal.\n\nMore supportive sources say that Heberd supports Puthoff's version that in the second instance Heberd suggested he would be more impressed if Swann could stop the field change altogether. Heberd denies he told James Randi that he never suggested it. \n\nPuthoff writes Dr. Heberd suggested all along there must be something wrong with the equipment. The following day it was certain the magnetometer was malfunctioning. \"The equipment was behaving erratically; it was not possible to obtain a stable background signal for calibration.\" Therefore, the experiment was not repeated. Swann related this SNAFU in his book, \"Remote Viewing: The Real Story.\" In his CIA report, paranormal expert, Dr. Kenneth A. Kress, does not record anything about Heberd's malfunctioning suggestions. Kress only writes, \"These variations were never seen before or after this visit.\" Though Swann was to spend a year at SRI, in their book, Targ and Puthoff present no further data and, Swann did not mention he was involved in any other PK experiments with the magnetometer than those that occurred and were recorded on June 6, 1972.\n\nImmediately after, Puthoff wrote a brief paper in a draft form. Rather than publishing the results in a scientific journal inviting peer review, this paper was circulated hand to hand throughout research and academic institutions across the US, and Puthoff accepted invitations to speak. This paper caught the attention of the CIA and two agents paid a visit to Hal Puthoff at SRI and also met Swann. Later this paper was published as a part of a conference proceedings.\n\nTarg and Puthoff write about their pilot experiments, \"We couldn't overlook the possibility that perhaps Ingo knew the geographical features of the Earth and their approximate latitude and longitude. (It is Swann who suggests these Coordinate Remote Viewing tests, not the experimenters. He is in control.) \"Or it was possible that we were inadvertently cueing the subject (Swann), since we as experimenters knew what the answers were.\"\n\nSoon Targ and Puthoff performed more experiments with Swann and the controls were tightened to eliminate the possibility of error. This time Swann was given the latitude and longitude of ten targets, in the end there would be ten runs, for a total of 100. \"Only\" the evaluations of the ten targets from the tenth run, the last, were disclosed. The results of the targets from the previous ninety (runs 1–9) are ignored. For the tenth run Swann had seven hits, two neutral and one miss. The experiments came to a close. Targ and Puthoff were positive \"Something was happening, but they are not clear what it is.\" (This method of selecting a small number of \"guesses\" from a larger, sometimes never disclosed larger number, is known as the \"free response method\" in remote viewing but could be called cherry picking.) According to Swann and Stanford Research International, his RV was correct probably 95% of the time. His personally trained students' RV were 85% correct, 85% of the time. See:Stargate Project\n\nSwann proposed a study to Targ and Puthoff. At first they resisted, for the resulting descriptions would be impossible to verify. Yet, on the evening 27 April 1973 Targ and Puthoff recorded Swann's remote viewing session of the planet Jupiter and Jupiter's moons, prior to the Voyager probe's visit there in 1979.\n\nSwann asked for 30 minutes of silence. According to Swann, his ability to see Jupiter took about three and a half minutes. In the session he made several reports on the physical features of Jupiter, such as its atmosphere and the surface of its core. Swann claimed to see bands of crystals in the atmosphere, which he likened to clouds and possibly like the rings of Saturn. The Voyager probe later confirmed the existence of the rings of Jupiter, although these rings are not in the planet's atmosphere. However, Swann's claim that crystals are present in the atmosphere is supported by observations by NASA's Galileo spacecraft of clouds of ammonia ice crystals in the northwest corner of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.\n\nThe following are Swann's own version of his statements from 1995, 22 years later than the 1973 experiments took place:\n[6:06:20] Very high in the atmosphere there are crystals ... they glitter. \"Maybe\" the stripes are like bands of crystals, \"maybe\" like rings of Saturn, though not far out like that. Very close within the atmosphere. [Unintelligible sentence.] I bet you they'll reflect radio probes. Is that possible if you had a cloud of crystals that were assaulted by different radio waves?\n\n[6:08:00] Now I'll go down through. It feels really good there [laughs]. I said that before, didn't I? Inside those cloud layers, those crystal layers, they look beautiful from the outside. From the inside they look like rolling gas clouds – eerie yellow light, rainbows.\n\n[6:10:20] I get the impression, though I don't see, that it's liquid.\n\n[6:10:55] Then I came through the cloud cover. The surface – it looks like sand dunes. They're made of very large grade crystals, so they slide. Tremendous winds, sort of like maybe the prevailing winds of Earth, but very close to the surface of Jupiter. From that view, the horizon looks orangish or rose-colored, but overhead it's kind of greenish-yellow.\n\n[6:12:35] If I look to the right there is an enormous mountain range.\n\n[6:14:45] I feel that there's liquid somewhere. Those mountains are very huge but they still don't poke up through the crystal cloud cover. You know I had a dream once something like this, where the cloud cover was a great arc ... sweeps over the entire heaven. Those grains which make that sand orange are quite large. They have a polished surface and they look something like amber or like obsidian but they're yellowish and not as heavy. The wind blows them. They slide along.\n\n[6:16:37] If I turn, the whole thing seems enormously flat. I mean, if I get the feeling that if a man stood on those sands, I think he would sink into them [laughs]. Maybe that's where that liquid feeling comes from.\nSwann's transcript contained in \"Mind-Reach: Scientists Look at Psychic Ability\" by Russell Targ & Harold Putoff is slightly different from Swann's later version. There is no mention of sand and he also states, \"I feel there is liquid some-where ... liquid like water.\"\n\nSwann's total observations lasted for about 20 minutes. He made no mention of the many moons of Jupiter, which as of February 2004 counted 63. The raw data comprised only four pages, but according to Swann, the confirmatory data appeared throughout the published scientific and technical articles and papers. It was decided that all of these should be included in their entirety to ensure that no scientific passage was inadvertently used out of context. The feedback data, therefore, amounted to about 300 pages.\n\nIn November 2001, there was an article by Michael Persinger published in \"The Journal of Neuropsychiatry & Clinical Neurosciences.\" The results with Swann suggested that during his remote viewing there were associated measurable changes in brain activity. There was bipolar electroencephalographic activity over the occipital, temporal and frontal lobes. Persinger concluded that there was \"significant congruence\" between the stimuli and Swann's electroencephalographic activity.\n\nSwann reported that out of the twenty-five criminal cases he worked between 1972 and 1979, twenty-two were flops and three were successes. According to Swann, Gerard Croiset and Peter Hurkos were super sensitive sleuths. Authors Arthur Lyons and Marcello Truzzi Ph.D., also a founder of the International Remote Viewing Association, wrote the Croiset and Hurkos cases were \"pure bunk\" in their 1991 book \"The Blue Sense: Psychic Detectives and Crime.\"\n\nSwann was a supporter of ufology and James W. Moseley's \"Saucer Smear\" newsletter. Swann, writing \"in appreciation of 'Saucer Smear' and its Esteemed Editor\", wrote that \"although many of its readers might view 'Saucer Smear' merely as a droll ufology gossip rag, in the larger picture it is rather more accurately a profound 'window' opening up onto the sociology of ufology. Therefore its cumulative issues constitute a precious historical archive.\"\n\nIn his 1998 autobiography \"Penetration: The Question of Extraterrestrial and Human Telepathy\", Swann described his work with individuals in an unknown agency who study extraterrestrials (E.T.), his remote viewing of a secret E.T. base on the hidden side of the Moon and his \"shocking\" experience with a sexy scantily dressed female E.T. in a Los Angeles supermarket. He concludes that extraterrestrials are living on Earth in humanoid bodies. Swann deduces that there are many extraterrestrials, that many are \"bio-androids\", and that they are aware their only foes on Earth are psychics. Later, Swann and an individual known as \"Mr. Axelrod\" took a flight to an unknown northerly destination, deduced by Swann as possibly Alaska. Along with two \"twin\" body guards, Swann and Axelrod attempt to secretly watch a recurrent UFO appear and suck up the water of a lake. Mr. Axelrod discloses that the silent, growing, oscillating triangle is simultaneously scanning the area and eliminating any animals in the area and that the silent \"beams\" emanating from the object were \"blasting deer or porcupines from the woods or something.\" The \"twin\" bodyguards come to attention they've been discovered and the group is \"attacked\" by the UFO. Swann was thrown to safety by his colleagues and sustained a minor injury.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is an automotive equivalent of the horse-drawn fast, lightweight phaeton carriage. \n\nA popular style in the US from the mid–1920s and continuing into the first half of the 1930s was the dual cowl phaeton, with a cowl separating the rear passengers from the driver and front passenger.\n\nPhaetons fell from favour when closed cars and convertible body styles became widely available during the 1930s. Eventually, the term \"phaeton\" became so widely and loosely applied that almost any vehicle with two axles and a row or rows of seats across the body could be called a phaeton. Convertibles and pillarless hardtops were marketed as \"phaetons\" after actual phaetons were phased out.\n\nThe term \"phaeton\" had historically described a light, open four-wheeled carriage. When automobiles arrived it was applied to a light two-seater with minimal coachwork. The term was interchangeable with \"spyder\", derived from a light form of phaeton carriage known as a \"spider\". Originally meant to denote a faster and lighter vehicle than a touring car, the two terms eventually became interchangeable.\n\nA detachable folding or rigid roof could be added before a drive in preparation for inclement weather, and side curtains or screens could be installed once the roof was in place. This was mainly temporary and partial relief rather than the more permanent, watertight protection offered by a convertible. As a result, a phaeton was much lighter than the sturdier, weather-ready convertible. Since the body was entirely open, it was easy to add or remove an extra row of seating where space had been left in the original construction.\n\nA phaeton differs from a convertible in having no winding or sliding windows in the doors or the body, and no permanent roof, whether rigid or folding.\n\nThere were also double phaetons, with two rows of seats, triple phaetons, or even closed phaetons.\n\nAfter 1912, American use of the term began to be most closely associated with the \"triple phaeton\" body configurations that had room for three rows of seats, whether all three were installed or not. This also led to the term \"phaeton\" becoming similar to, and eventually interchangeable with, the term \"touring car\".\n\nA specific use of the term \"phaeton\" is with the \"dual cowl phaeton\", a body style in which the rear passengers were separated from the driver and the front passengers by a cowl or bulkhead, often with its own folding windshield.\n\nThe phaeton and the touring car were popular up to the 1930s, after which they were largely replaced by the convertible, which also had a retractable roof, but also included side windows so that the car could be completely enclosed. The Willys-Overland Jeepster was the last true phaeton produced by a major US automaker, and was introduced ten years after the previous phaeton to be offered by an American manufacturer.\n\nIn 1952, a year after Willys last offered the Jeepster, Chrysler built three Imperial Parade Phaetons for ceremonial use, one by New York City, one by Los Angeles, and one intended for the White House but ultimately used for events throughout the United States. These were dual-cowl phaetons custom-built on Chrysler Corporation's stretched Imperial Crown Limousine chassis.\nIn the late 1930s, Buick included a \"convertible phaeton\" body style, which was actually a four-door convertible, as the doors had windows in them and the car could be fully closed.\n\nDuring the 1956 model year, Mercury marketed the four-door hardtop versions of its Montclair and Monterey models as \"phaetons.\"\n\nIn 2004, Volkswagen introduced a vehicle with the name Phaeton, which has a typical four-door sedan body style.\n\n"}

{"id": "1935605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935605", "title": "Micropropagation", "text": "Micropropagation\n\nMicropropagation is the practice of rapidly multiplying stock plant material to produce many progeny plants, using modern plant tissue culture methods.\n\nMicropropagation is used to multiply plants such as those that have been genetically modified or bred through conventional plant breeding methods. It is also used to provide a sufficient number of plantlets for planting from a stock plant which does not produce seeds, or does not respond well to vegetative reproduction.\n\nCornell University botanist Frederick Campion Steward discovered and pioneered micropropagation and plant tissue culture in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nIn short, steps of micropropagation can be divided into 4 stages.\n\n\nMicropropagation begins with the selection of plant material to be propagated. The plant tissues are removed from an intact plant in a sterile condition. Clean stock materials that are free of viruses and fungi are important in the production of the healthiest plants. Once the plant material is chosen for culture, the collection of explant(s) begins and is dependent on the type of tissue to be used; including stem tips, anthers, petals, pollen and other plant tissues. The explant material is then surface sterilized, usually in multiple courses of bleach and alcohol washes, and finally rinsed in sterilized water. This small portion of plant tissue, sometimes only a single cell, is placed on a growth medium, typically containing sucrose as an energy source and one or more plant growth regulators (plant hormones). Usually the medium is thickened with agar to create a gel which supports the explant during growth. Some plants are easily grown on simple media, but others require more complicated media for successful growth; the plant tissue grows and differentiates into new tissues depending on the medium. For example, media containing cytokinin are used to create branched shoots from plant buds.\n\nMultiplication is the taking of tissue samples produced during the first stage and increasing their number. Following the successful introduction and growth of plant tissue, the establishment stage is followed by multiplication. Through repeated cycles of this process, a single explant sample may be increased from one to hundreds and thousands of plants. Depending on the type of tissue grown, multiplication can involve different methods and media. If the plant material grown is callus tissue, it can be placed in a blender and cut into smaller pieces and recultured on the same type of culture medium to grow more callus tissue. If the tissue is grown as small plants called plantlets, hormones are often added that cause the plantlets to produce many small offshoots. After the formation of multiple shoots, these shoots are transferred to rooting medium with a high auxin\\cytokinin ratio. After the development of roots, plantlets can be used for hardening.\n\nThis stage involves treating the plantlets/shoots produced to encourage root growth and \"hardening.\"\nIt is performed \"in vitro\", or in a sterile \"test tube\" environment.\n\n\"Hardening\" refers to the preparation of the plants for a natural growth environment. Until this stage, the plantlets have been grown in \"ideal\" conditions, designed to encourage rapid growth. Due to the controlled nature of their maturation, the plantlets often do not have fully functional dermal coverings. This causes them to be highly susceptible to disease and inefficient in their use of water and energy. In vitro conditions are high in humidity, and plants grown under these conditions often do not form a working cuticle and stomata that keep the plant from drying out. When taken out of culture, the plantlets need time to adjust to more natural environmental conditions. Hardening typically involves slowly weaning the plantlets from a high-humidity, low light, warm environment to what would be considered a normal growth environment for the species in question.\n\nIn the final stage of plant micropropagation, the plantlets are removed from the plant media and transferred to soil or (more commonly) potting compost for continued growth by conventional methods.\n\nThis stage is often combined with the \"pretransplant\" stage.\n\nIn Meristem culture the meristem and a few subtending leaf primordial are placed into a suitable growing media. An elongated rooted plantlet is produced after some weeks, and is transferred to the soil when it has attained a considerable height. A disease free plant can be produced by this method. Experimental result also suggest that this technique can be successfully utilized for rapid multiplication of various plant materials, e.g. Sugarcane, strawberry.\n\nA callus is mass of undifferentiated parenchymatous cells. When a living plant tissue is placed in an artificial growing medium with other conditions favorable, callus is formed. The growth of callus varies with the homogenous levels of auxin and Cytokinin and can be manipulated by endogenous supply of these growth regulators in the culture medium. The callus growth and its organogenesis or embryogenesis can be referred into three different stages.\n\n\nA cell suspension culture refers to cells and or groups of cells dispersed and growing in an aerated liquid culture medium (Street, 1997, Thorpe1981) is placed in a liquid medium and shaken vigorously and balanced dose of hormones. Suezawa et al. ( 1988) reported Cytokinin induced adventitious buds in kiwi fruit in a suspension culture sub- culture for about a week.\n\nIn embryo culture, the embryo is excised and placed into a culture medium with proper nutrient in aseptic condition. To obtain a quick and optimum growth into plantlets, it is transferred to soil. It is particularly important for the production of interspecific and intergeneric hybrids and to overcome the embryo .\n\nIn protoplast culture, the plant cell can be isolated with the help of wall degrading enzymes and growth in a suitable culture medium in a controlled condition for regeneration of plantlets. Under suitable conditions the protoplast develops a cell wall followed by an increase in cell division and differentiation and grows into a new plant. The protoplast are first cultured in liquid medium at 25 to 28 C with a light intensity of 100 to 500 lux or in dark and after undergoing substantial cell division, they are transferred into solid medium congenial or morphogenesis in many horticultural crops respond well to protoplast culture.\n\nMicropropagation has a number of advantages over traditional plant propagation techniques:\n\nMicropropagation is not always the perfect means of multiplying plants. Conditions that limits its use include:\n\n\nThe major limitation in the use of micropropagation for many plants is the cost of production; for many plants the use of seeds, which are normally disease free and produced in good numbers, readily produce plants (see orthodox seed) in good numbers at a lower cost. For this reason, many plant breeders do not utilize micropropagation because the cost is prohibitive. Other breeders use it to produce stock plants that are then used for seed multiplication.\n\nMechanisation of the process could reduce labour costs, but has proven difficult to achieve, despite active attempts to develop technological solutions.\n"}
{"id": "1935606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935606", "title": "Henry Saad", "text": "Henry Saad\n\nHenry William Saad (born June 1948, in Detroit, Michigan) is a judge on the Michigan Court of Appeals and a former nominee to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n\nJudge Saad received his bachelor's degree from Wayne State University School of Business with honors and his law degree from Wayne State University, magna cum laude. He was a partner at Dickinson, Wright, Moon, Van Dusen & Freeman, where he practiced law for twenty years. He was also an arbitrator for the Michigan Employment Relations Commission and a hearing referee for the Michigan Department of Civil Rights.\n\nOn October 2, 1992, President George H.W. Bush nominated Saad to a seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, but the Senate Judiciary Committee of the 102nd Congress failed to give him a hearing and let his nomination lapse.\n\nSaad was appointed to the Michigan Court of Appeals in 1994, was elected for a six-year term in 1996, and was re-elected to a six-year term in 2002.\n\nOn November 8, 2001, Saad was nominated by President George W. Bush to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated by the Judge James L. Ryan who had taken senior status. On the same day, Bush also nominated David McKeague and Susan Bieke Neilson to Michigan seats on the Sixth Circuit. On June 26, 2002, Bush nominated Richard Allen Griffin to a fourth Michigan seat on the Sixth Circuit. During the Democratic-controlled 107th Congress, all four nominations were stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee by then chairman, Senator Patrick Leahy, D-VT.\n\nIn the 2002 midterm congressional elections, the Republicans regained control of the Senate. During the new 108th Congress, Senator Orrin Hatch, R-UT, the new Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee began to process the previously blocked four nominees. In March 2003, Michigan's two Democratic senators, Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow, announced that they would blue-slip all Bush judicial nominees from Michigan because Bush refused to renominate Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis, two Michigan nominees, to the Sixth Circuit, whose nominations the Senate Republicans had refused to process during President Bill Clinton's second term. Helene White at the time was married to Levin's cousin.\n\nContrary to Levin's and Stabenow's wishes, Hatch gave Saad, McKeague and Griffin committee hearings, and passed the three nominees out of committee. Angered, Levin and Stabenow convinced their caucus to filibuster the three in order to prevent them from having confirmation votes.\n\nThe Senate Republicans increased their numbers in the 109th Congress. Tensions between the Republicans and Democrats rose dramatically as the Republicans contemplated breaking the filibusters of ten Bush court of appeals nominees (including Saad, McKeague and Griffin) by using the nuclear option. During a debate concerning filibusters and the nuclear option, Judge Saad was accused by Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nevada) of having a background that had some national security concerns, apparently in violation of various Senate rules (Senate Rule 29, Section 5). Various pundits condemned Sen. Reid for these remarks about a confidential security relationship, comparing it to the Valerie Plame affair within the Bush administration.\n\nIn order to defuse the explosive situation concerning the use of the nuclear option and Democrats' obstruction of President Bush's judicial nominations, fourteen moderate Republican and Democratic senators called the Gang of 14 joined together to forge an agreement to guarantee certain filibustered nominations up or down votes. Henry Saad and William Myers, however, were expressly excluded from the guarantee. Saad was excluded due to further opposition from Levin and Stabenow because he had angered Stabenow in September 2003 by sending out an e-mail critical of her participation in his original obstruction. In the e-mail, Saad wrote to a supporter about Stabenow, \"This is the game they play. Pretend to do the right thing while abusing the system and undermining the constitutional process. Perhaps some day she will pay the price for her misconduct.\" Stabenow became aware of the e-mail when Saad accidentally sent it not only to the supporter but also to Stabenow's office. .\n\nOn March 23, 2006, with no hope of a confirmation vote, Saad withdrew his nomination. His 2001-2006 nomination is one of the longest nominations never acted upon by the Senate. His nomination was later replaced by that of Raymond Kethledge, who was only confirmed in 2008 after Bush agreed to renominate Helene White, now divorced from Levin's cousin, to the Sixth Circuit.\n\nIn November 2007, the Michigan Supreme Court appointed Judge Saad to a two-year term as chief judge of the Court of Appeals beginning January 1, 2008.\n\nHe is an adjunct professor at the University of Detroit/Mercy School of Law and Wayne State University Law School, where he teaches Evidence, Public Sector Labor and Professional Responsibility, respectively. Judge Saad serves on the boards of Detroit Public Television, the American Heart Association and Brother Rice High School.\n\nSaad's wife, attorney Mara Letica Saad, was nominated by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 to be ambassador to Croatia. The nomination came late in Bush's presidency, however, and never was acted upon by the United States Senate before Bush's presidency ended. President Bill Clinton chose not to renominate her.\n\n\n"}

Born in Novgorod, Russia in 1873, he studied at the Moscow Conservatory with Nikolai Zverev, Alexander Siloti, Sergei Taneyev and Anton Arensky, and while there, composed some of his most famous works, including the first piano concerto (Op. 1) and the Prelude in C minor (Op. 3, No. 2). Although spread over three different opuses, he did go on to complete an important set of 24 preludes in all the major and minor keys. His Symphony No. 1 (Op. 13) was one of his first compositions as a \"Free Artist\" after graduation, and subsequently his first critical failure. The derision he received sent him into depression. After undergoing autosuggestive therapy, he regained his confidence and composed his second piano concerto (Op. 18), which is still part of the major orchestra repertoire today. In 1909, he made his first concert tour of the United States, and composed his Piano Concerto No. 3 (Op. 30), notable for its structural ingenuity and technical difficulty. After this, due to emigration from Russia in 1917 and his busy concert career, his output as a composer greatly decreased, and during this period, he completed only six compositions. His last major work, \"Symphonic Dances\" (Op. 45), was completed in the USA in 1940.\n\n"}

{"id": "1935620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935620", "title": "Fredrik Barth", "text": "Fredrik Barth\n\nThomas Fredrik Weybye Barth (22 December 1928 – 24 January 2016) was a Norwegian social anthropologist who published several ethnographic books with a clear formalist view. He was a professor in the Department of Anthropology at Boston University, and previously held professorships at the University of Oslo, the University of Bergen (where he founded the Department of Social Anthropology), Emory University and Harvard University. He was appointed a government scholar in 1985.\n\nBarth was born in Leipzig, Germany to Thomas Barth, a professor of geology, and his wife Randi Thomassen. They also had a daughter. Barth and his sister grew up in Norway in an academic family. Their uncle was Edvard Kaurin Barth, a professor of zoology. Fredrik Barth developed an interest in evolution and human origins. When his father was invited to give a lecture at the University of Chicago, the younger man accompanied him and decided to attend the university, enrolling in 1946. He earned an MA in paleoanthropology and archaeology in 1949.\n\nAfter receiving his MA, Barth returned to Norway, keeping a connection to Chicago faculty. In 1951 he joined an archaeological expedition to Iraq led by Robert Braidwood. Barth stayed on after the expedition was over, and conducted ethnographic population studies with the Kurdish population. He spent a year at the London School of Economics (LSE) writing up this data, and in 1953 published his first book, \"Principles of Social Organization in Southern Kurdistan.\"\n\nBarth had originally planned to submit the manuscript of his \"Principles of Social Organization\" as his Ph.D. dissertation, but was unsuccessful in doing so. He continued graduate study, moving to Cambridge, England to study with Edmund Leach, whom he had previously worked with at the LSE. For his PhD, Barth conducted fieldwork in Swat, Pakistan; his completed dissertation was published in 1959 as \"Political Leadership among Swat Pathan\". Shortly afterwards he was part of a UNESCO study of pastoral nomadism, which focused on the Basseri in what is now Iran. From this work, he published the 1961 monograph \"Nomads of South Persia\". \nIn 1961, Barth was invited to the University of Bergen to create an anthropology department and serve as the chair. This important and prestigious position gave him the opportunity to introduce British-style social anthropology to Norway. The only other existing anthropology program, at the University of Oslo, was older and connected to the university's ethnographic museum (now the Museum of Cultural History). It was based in Victorian folklore and museum approaches. By founding the department at Bergen, Barth hoped to create a modern, world-class department with an approach similar to those found in England and the United States.\n\nBarth remained at Bergen from 1961 to 1972. During this time his own work developed in two key ways. First, he developed research projects inside Norway (and published a study entitled \"The Role of the Entrepreneur in Social Change in Northern Norway\" in 1963). Second, he began writing more purely theoretical works that secured his international reputation within anthropology. These included \"Models of Social Organization\" (1966) and especially the small, edited volume, \"Ethnic Groups and Boundaries: The Social Organization of Cultural Difference\" (1969). Barth's introduction to \"Ethnic Groups and Boundaries\" became his most well-known essay and \"ended up among the top 100 on the social science citation index for a number of years.\".\n\nIn 1974 Barth moved to Oslo, where he became professor of social anthropology and the head of the city's Museum of Cultural History. During this period, anthropology was changing. Marxism and interpretive approaches were becoming more central, while Barth's focus on strategy and choice was being taken up by economics and related disciplines. Barth shifted to studying meaning and ritual as developed in ethnic groups, and conducted research in Papua New Guinea, where he conducted fieldwork with the Baktaman. He published several works from these studies, namely the \"Ritual and Knowledge among the Baktaman of New Guinea\" (1975). He also continued studies in the Middle East, conducting fieldwork in Oman with his wife Unni Wikan. This resulted in his 1983 volume \"Sohar: Culture and Society in an Omani Town\".\n\nBarth received a state scholarship from the Norwegian government in 1985. He left the country to accept two positions in the United States—at Emory University from 1989 to 1996, and Boston University from 1997 to 2008. By this time, Barth and his wife \"felt we had both done our share of physically strenuous fieldwork\" and decided to begin an ethnographic project in Bali. He developed an interest in the anthropology of knowledge at around this time, an interest which he explored in his book \"Balinese Worlds\" (1993). More recently, he has also conducted research in Bhutan.\n\nBarth was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. In 1997 he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nBarth was married 1949–1972 to Mary (\"Molly\") Allee (27 April 1926 – December 1998), and he was married again 30 January 1974 to Unni Wikan, professor of social anthropology at the University of Oslo, Norway. His sister Tone Barth (25 January 1924 – 10 October 1980) was married 1945–1963 to Terkel Rosenqvist (1921–2011), also an academic, and she was married again in 1963 to the Norwegian politician for the Conservative Party Vidkunn Hveding (1921–2001). Barth died in Norway on 24 January 2016 at the age of 87.\n\nHe was well known among anthropologists for his Transactionalism analysis of political processes in the Swat Valley of northern Pakistan, and his study of micro-economic processes and entrepreneurship in the area of Darfur in Sudan. The latter has been regarded as a classical example of formalist analysis in economic anthropology. During his long career, Barth has also published acclaimed studies based on field works in Bali, New Guinea, and several countries in the Middle East, thematically covering a wide array of subjects.\n\nBarth has been an influential scholar on the subject of ethnicity. Andreas Wimmer wrote in 2008, \"The comparative study of ethnicity rests firmly on the ground established by Fredrik Barth in his well-known [1969] introduction to a collection of ethnographic case studies.\" As the editor of \"Ethnic Groups and Boundaries\" (1969), Barth outlined an approach to the study of ethnicity that focused on the ongoing negotiations of boundaries between groups of people. Barth's view was that such groups were not discontinuous cultural isolates, or logical \"a prioris\" to which people naturally belong.\n\nBarth parted with anthropological notions of cultures as bounded entities, and ethnicity as primordial bonds. He focused on the interface and interaction between groups that gave rise to identities.\n\n\"Ethnic Groups and Boundaries\", which he edited, concentrates on the interconnections of ethnic identities. Barth writes in his introduction (p. 9):\n... categorical ethnic distinctions do not depend on an absence of mobility, contact and information, but do entail social processes of exclusion and incorporation whereby discrete categories are maintained \"despite\" changing participation and membership in the course of individual life histories.\n\nHe emphasizes the use by groups of categories - i.e. ethnic labels - that usually endure even when individual members move across boundaries or share an identity with people in more than one group.\n\nThe inter-dependency of ethnic groups is a pivotal argument throughout both the introduction and the following chapters. As interdependent, ethnic identities are the product of continuous so-called ascription (Cf. Ascriptive inequality) and self-ascription, Barth stresses the interactional perspective of social anthropology on the level of the persons involved instead of on a socio-structural level. Ethnic identity \"becomes\" and is maintained through relational processes of inclusion and exclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Steinhauer was a Treaty Indian of Cree descent. Steinhaurs's father Josiah would die in 1908, and his mother would marry James Arthur Steinhauer on October 12, 1910, a descendant of the Cree Methodist Missionary Henry Bird Steinhauer.\n\nHe married Isabel Florence Margaret Davidson on November 20, 1928 and had five children. In 1937, Ralph Steinhauer was diagnosed with tuberculosis and a decision was made to send the three eldest children to a residential school. After his recovery, his wife Isabel would educate the children at home after their request to have the children educated at a community school was denied on the basis of their Indigenous heritage.\n\nSteinhauer would become a farmer and began clearing a 16-hectare homestead, and would continue farming until his death in 1987. During the Great Depression Steinhauer would supplement his farming work with other labour such as logging and cutting fence posts. \n\nHe died in Edmonton on September 19, 1987, following pulmonary problems.\n\nRalph Steinhauer moved schools several times as a child due to his father's work as a missionary. Steinhauer would attend the residential school in Red Deer, the Doucet, Roseneath, Vilettea and Stry schools in northern Alberta and for three years starting in 1920 the Brandon Indian Residential school in Manitoba, and finished with a Grade 8 education. When Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau asked him to be the lieutenant-governor of Alberta, he responded, \"I'm not schooled for a thing like this... You're plucking a person out of the farmyard and an Indian at that.\"\n\nIn the 1920s, he became district president of the United Farmers of Alberta. He was a founder and the president of the Indian Association of Alberta.\n\nHe ran unsuccessfully as the Liberal candidate for the House of Commons of Canada in the Alberta riding of Vegreville in the 1963 federal election, placing a distant third behind Progressive Conservative Frank Fane and Social Credit candidate Metro Tomyn. Steinhauer would be the second Treaty Indian to run as a candidate in a federal election.\n\nHe was chief of the Saddle Lake Indian Band for three years between 1966 and 1969. He would establish the Saddle Lake Centennial Development Association which became a successful farming venture for the First Nation.\n\nOn the advice of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Ralph G. Steinhauer was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Alberta effective July 2, 1974. This appointment was made by Jules Léger, Governor General of Canada. His Senior Aide-de-Camp was Lieutenant-Colonel John H. Quarton, and his Secretary was M. Patricia Halligan. Federal Justice Minister Otto Lang would explain the significance of the appointment to the Edmonton Journal saying \"\"The Queen's appointment of an Indian is historic in that it was the Queen [Victoria] who built a trust with the Indians of Canada so many years ago.\"\"\n\nSteinhauer was known for voicing his personal opinions regarding Indigenous issues in Canada while holding the generally apolitical role as Lieutenant Governor. In 1977, during the opening of the third session of the 18th Alberta Legislature Steinhauer would read the speech from the throne while dressed in the full regalia of a Nehiraw Chief, and on one his final days in the Legislature, Steinhauer while giving Royal Assent to legislation reflected on his time as Lieutenant Governor and in thanking the members of the assembly remarked \"\"May the Great Spirit remain with you, and will you always carry on such a well-done job\"\", becoming the first time the Great Spirit had been invoked in the provincial legislature. In a 1976 speech delivered at the University of Calgary, Steinhauer presented a list of injustices inflicted upon Indigenous peoples, and going so far as to suggest he might withhold Royal Assent for legislation affecting First Nations until there was some improvement. \n\nIn July 1976 Steinhauer headed a delegation commemorating the signing of Treaty Six and Seven to Buckingham Palace. He had convinced Premier Peter Lougheed to support and finance the trip as well as received the support of the Governor General noting \"\"it is the wish of the native people that a representative deputation of Chiefs…should visit the United Kingdom\"\". However, the Governor General and federal government wanted assurances that the visit to England would not be a political event and Steinhauer agreed to ensure the occasions's apolitical nature. Upon being presentedto the Queen, disregarded apolitical protocol and proceeded to raise Indigenous issues. On his return to Edmonton, Steinhauer's account would be printed in the Edmonton Journal \"\"I was just stating facts. Because of the Indian Act, aren’t we wards of the government? Isn’t that a fact? You should read the act. Just about every clause begins ‘With the consent of the governor-in-council the Indians shall…\"\".\n\nLater in 1977 Steinhauer would be approached by several First Nations, the Alberta Human Rights and Civil Liberties Association about the potential effects of the proposed Bill 29 \"Land Title Amendment Act\" and the potential effect of amendments on Treaty rights in Northern Alberta. Steinhauer had the legislation studied by a legal firm and in the end granted Royal Assent.\n\nRalph G. Steinhauer served as Lieutenant Governor until his successor was appointed effective October 18, 1979. He then returned to his farm at Saddle Lake.\n\nIn 1967, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1984, he was inducted into the Alberta Agriculture Hall of Fame. Steinhauer would also receive an Honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from the University of Alberta in 1976, and the University of Calgary in 1979. In addition an Honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from St. Stephen's College, Edmonton in 1985. As well, he was a Knight of Grace of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem (1975). The Ralph Steinhauer Award of Distinction a collegiate scholarship provided by the Government of Alberta recognizes academic achievement.\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group. KTXL's studios are located on Fruitridge Road near the Oak Park district on the southern side of Sacramento, and its transmitter is located in Walnut Grove, California.\n\nThe UHF channel 40 frequency in Sacramento was first occupied by KCCC-TV, which signed on in September 1953. It was affiliated with all four television networks of the time: ABC, CBS, NBC and the DuMont Television Network. KCCC's first broadcast was the 1953 World Series between the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers. The station became a primary ABC affiliate by 1955, after KCRA-TV (channel 3) and KBET-TV (channel 10, now KXTV) signed on, respectively taking over NBC and CBS full-time; and dropped DuMont after that network folded in 1956. It was the Sacramento/Stockton/Modesto area's first television station. However, as a UHF station, it suffered in the ratings because television sets were not required to incorporate UHF tuning until the All-Channel Receiver Act went into effect in 1964. Although its fate was sealed when the first VHF stations signed on in the area, it managed to hang on until 1957. The ABC affiliation moved to KOVR (channel 13) after KCCC-TV and KOVR reached an agreement to merge operations and turn over the KCCC license to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n\nThe former KCCC-TV studios and transmitting facilities were then sold to a group of broadcasters who applied for a new license, returning channel 40 to the air in 1959 as KVUE, broadcasting from studios near the old California state fairgrounds off Stockton Boulevard. The station operated for just under five months before also falling silent. The KVUE call letters now reside on the ABC affiliate in Austin, Texas.\n\nIn 1963, KVUE attempted to file for a license renewal even though the station had been off the air for more than three years; Camellia City Telecasters, a group headed by Jack Matranga, former owner and co-founder of radio station KGMS (now KTKZ), filed an application with the FCC to build a station on channel 40, as a challenge to the KVUE renewal, and was granted the license in early 1965. KTXL first signed on the air on October 26, 1968, operating as an independent station for nearly the first two decades of its existence. It was then branded as \"TV 40\". The station gained a huge advantage early on when its original owner won the local syndication rights to a massive number of movies, including classic and contemporary films. At one point, it had one of the largest film libraries in the Sacramento area. In addition, KTXL ventured into in-house productions, such as the children's program \"Captain Mitch\", horror movie host Bob Wilkins and \"Big Time Wrestling\". The latter show aired until 1979, and was syndicated to several stations in California, Utah, Alaska and Hawaii. Channel 40 was one of the few stations to hold syndicated rights to the entire \"Merrie Melodies/Looney Tunes\" cartoon libraries (up until recently, different companies held different components of the cartoon output; all rights are now held by Warner Bros.).\n\nIn 1977, KTXL began a summer tradition by showcasing critically acclaimed classic feature films in annual \"Summer Film Festival\" presentations. Channel 40 made television history in 1981, by broadcasting the 1978 film \"The Deer Hunter\" (and later, many other movies) unedited with potentially objectionable material intact – this policy has been restricted somewhat in recent years. All of this made KTXL one of the leading independent stations in the western United States. It also attained regional superstation status via microwave relay to nearly every cable system in northern California, including the San Francisco Bay Area and Fresno, as well as several cable systems in Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Idaho and Montana.\n\nKTXL began transmitting its signal from a \"Monster Tower\" near Walnut Grove in October 1985, significantly increasing its signal strength and adding stereo capability. Initially, the station would only turn on the stereo feed during programming broadcast in the audio format. This sometimes resulted in the staff forgetting to turn it on right at the beginning of a stereo program.\n\nOn October 9, 1986, KTXL became a charter affiliate of the upstart Fox network, and eventually started branding as \"Fox 40\" on-air. The following year, Camellia City Telecasters sold KTXL to Renaissance Broadcasting. While most Fox affiliates since the mid-1990s have shifted away from running classic sitcoms and cartoons, to run syndicated talk shows on their daytime schedules; until recently, KTXL was among a few stations to be an exception to this status: the daytime lineup continued to feature sitcoms well into the 2000s, even still holding syndication rights to \"The Andy Griffith Show\" after many decades. Though many shows from the 1980s and 1990s were featured on the schedule, a few talk shows, reality series and court shows also populated the lineup.\n\nIn place of the station's own children's lineup after Captain Mitch's retirement, the station aired programming from Fox Kids until the network eliminated the weekday afternoon block in September 2002; the Saturday morning lineup (which by that time, became known as 4Kids TV) was retained as it began being programmed by 4Kids Entertainment that year until Fox dropped children's programming from its schedule in November 2008.\n\nKTXL, along with NBC affiliate KCRA-TV, are the only Sacramento television stations to have never changed their network affiliations, as they were unaffected by affiliation swaps in 1995 (when KXTV acquired the ABC affiliation from KOVR, which in turn, switched to CBS) and 1998 (when KMAX-TV—channel 31—took UPN from KQCA—channel 58, which switched from UPN to The WB).\n\nKTXL was acquired by Tribune Broadcasting following the company's purchase of Renaissance Broadcasting in 1996.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, Hunt Valley, Maryland-based Sinclair Broadcast Group announced that it would acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune. Had the deal received regulatory approval by the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, the proposed sale would have put KTXL-TV (and sister stations KTLA in Los Angeles and KSWB-TV in San Diego) under common ownership with Sinclair's two existing California-based duopolies: CBS affiliate KBAK-TV and Fox affiliate KBFX-CD in Bakersfield, and Fox affiliate KMPH-TV and CW affiliate KFRE-TV in Fresno, California, plus pending acquisitions (from a separate deal) KRCR-TV and KAEF-TV in Redding and Eureka, respectively. It would have also marked a re-entry into the Sacramento market for Sinclair, which owned KOVR (channel 13) from 1997 until it sold the CBS affiliate to CBS Television Stations in 2005.\n\nOn February 22, 2018, \"Variety\" reported that Sinclair would sell KTXL to Fox Television Stations upon approval of the Tribune deal, On April 24, 2018, Sinclair announced that KTXL would be one of 23 stations sold to obtain approval for the merger, though it was one of seven stations for which a buyer was not disclosed. On May 9, 2018, it was officially announced that Fox Television Stations would buy KTXL, as part of a $910-million deal that also involved six other Tribune-owned stations (Fox affiliates KCPQ/Seattle, KSWB-TV/San Diego, KDVR/Denver, WJW/Cleveland and KSTU/Salt Lake City, and CW affiliate WSFL-TV/Miami). If the sale is approved, it would make KTXL a Fox owned-and-operated station and, along with existing sister station KSWB, a sister outlet to KTVU in San Francisco/Oakland and KTTV in Los Angeles. It would also be the fourth O&O station in Sacramento (behind Univision O&O KUVS, CBS O&O KOVR and CW O&O KMAX). \n\nThree weeks after the FCC's July 18 vote to have the deal reviewed by an administrative law judge amid \"serious concerns\" about Sinclair's forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties, on August 9, 2018, Tribune announced it would terminate the Sinclair deal, intending to seek other M&A opportunities. Tribune also filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that Sinclair engaged in protracted negotiations with the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division over regulatory issues, refused to sell stations in markets where it already had properties, and proposed divestitures to parties with ties to Sinclair executive chair David D. Smith that were rejected or highly subject to rejection to maintain control over stations it was required to sell. The termination of the Sinclair sale agreement places uncertainty for the future of Fox's purchases of KTXL and the other six Tribune stations included in that deal, which were predicated on the closure of the Sinclair–Tribune merger.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Irving, Texas-based Nexstar Media Group announced it would acquire the assets of Tribune Media for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The deal—which would make Nexstar the largest television station operator by total number of stations upon its expected closure late in the third quarter of 2019—would put KTXL-TV under common ownership with Nexstar's existing properties in Bakersfield (NBC affiliate KGET-TV and low-power Telemundo affiliate KKEY-LP), Fresno (NBC affiliate KSEE and CBS affiliate KGPE) and San Francisco (MyNetworkTV affiliate KRON-TV, which would be displaced as Nexstar's largest station property by KTXL's Los Angeles sister station KTLA). However, reports preceding the purchase announcement stated that, as it did during the group's failed purchase by Sinclair, Fox Television Stations may seek to acquire certain Fox-affiliated stations owned by Tribune—with KTXL potentially being a candidate for resale—from the eventual buyer of that group.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn January 1, 2011, KTXL became a charter affiliate of Tribune-owned classic television network Antenna TV upon its launch; it is carried on digital subchannel 40.2.\n\nIn November 1999, KTXL installed the first full-powered digital television transmitter in the Sacramento market operating on UHF channel 55. KTXL shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 40, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 55, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era UHF channel 40 for post-transition operations. With the transition, the height of the station's transmitter tower was increased to .\n\nIn 2016, KTXL began producing a midday lifestyle program called \"Studio 40 Live\". This program's format is similar to that of rival station KXTV's \"Sacramento and Company\". This program also utilizes a modified, re-colored version of KTXL's logo from the late 1980s to early 1990s.\n\nKTXL presently broadcasts 51½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 9½ hours each weekday and two hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); the station does not broadcast any local newscasts on weekend mornings.\n\nIn 1974, KTXL became the first station in the Sacramento market to carry a prime time newscast, titled \"The Ten O'Clock News\". Originally airing only five days a week, before later expanding to a nightly newscast; the program's original anchor team consisted of news anchor Dave Preston, weather and news anchor Jan Jeffries, and sports anchor Ken Gimblin. After Preston left for unknown reasons, Jeffries was named primary anchor with weather anchors substituting. Other news and sports anchors continued the format until 1979, when the newscast was revived by Pete Wilson as \"NewsPlus\", in a format that went beyond regular newscasts (hence the \"Plus\" in the show's title). Such anchor teams as Andy Asher and Regina Cambell, and later Lauraine Woodward and Ted Mullins helmed the now hour-long newscast until KTXL joined Fox in 1986, and evolved into the current format of what is now \"Fox 40 News at 10\".\n\nKTXL's main newscast competition at 10:00 p.m. includes a newscast on CBS-owned KOVR (which airs one hour earlier than the late newscasts on other \"Big Three\" stations) and a KCRA-produced news program on KQCA. Channel 40 ranks #1 in the ratings among the 18–49 adult demographic, and often comes in first or second in overall viewership at 10 p.m. In the summer of 2005, KTXL debuted a weekday morning newscast, which originally ran for two hours from 6 to 8 a.m., and primarily competes opposite KMAX's \"Good Day Sacramento\" and the first hour of KQCA's morning newscast. On September 8, 2008, the newscast was reformatted to \"Fox 40 Live\" and was expanded to 4½ hours from 4:30 to 9 a.m. The station hired well-known former Sacramento morning radio personality Paul Robins as anchor, and introduced a new news set adorned with flat-screens and an accompanying kitchen set.\n\nOn September 14, 2009, KTXL debuted both a midday newscast at 11:00 a.m. weekdays (which competes against KXTV's midday newscast in that time period) and an early evening newscast at 5:30 p.m. on weeknights to its schedule; this was later followed by the addition of a half-hour 6 p.m. newscast in September 2012. For over a decade, Fox (which has no network newscasts aside from \"Fox News Sunday\") has motivated its affiliates and stations to increase local news programming; KTXL and Tribune's other Fox stations did not follow this request until September 2009, when most of the stations (except for KCPQ in Seattle, which would not add early evening newscasts for another year) expanded their newscasts into midday and early evening timeslots.\n\nOn January 7, 2010, beginning with its 10:00 p.m. newscast, KTXL became the fourth station in the Sacramento market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. It was the first (and presently, the only) television station in the market to provide news video from the field in true high definition, as KTXL upgraded its ENG vehicles, satellite truck, studio and field cameras and other equipment in order to broadcast news footage from the field in high definition, in addition to segments broadcast from the main studio. This is in contrast to KCRA and KXTV, both of whom broadcast their field reports in widescreen standard definition (KOVR also shoots field reports in high definition but downconverts much of the footage to widescreen standard definition). On November 4, 2013, KTXL expanded its weekday evening news block to 90 minutes with the addition of a half-hour 5 p.m. newscast. Another expansion was made on September 18, 2017, with the addition of a half-hour 6:30 p.m. newscast. This newscast competes with a long-established newscast on KCRA and a KOVR-produced newscast on KMAX-TV. On December 4, 2019, KTXL debuted hour-long 7 p.m. newscast on weekdays, becoming the first and only 7 p.m. newscast in the Sacramento media market.\n\n\nOn February 12, 2010, KTXL was one of the first media outlets to obtain a video copy of a luge accident that occurred during the 2010 Winter Olympics, which resulted in the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili. KTXL made the editorial decision to post the video on its website, ahead of several major national and international outlets. The video clip raised some debate among journalism critics and editorial boards at several news organizations as to whether the footage should have been broadcast or posted online at all (the footage was briefly available on YouTube, but was removed several times due to copyright takedown notices filed by the International Olympic Committee).\n\nIn an interview with the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\", a KTXL staff member cited fair use as the decision to post the clip on the website after questions arose about the safety of the luge track. The station also ran the complete footage (though with occasional pauses and a viewer discretion advisory) during its 5:30 p.m. newscast that evening. The video was later distributed by KTXL to several other Tribune-owned websites.\n\nDuring KTXL's broadcast of Miss Universe 2015 (in which host Steve Harvey accidentally announced the wrong winner of the pageant), the show was cut off at 10 p.m. in order to start \"FOX40 News at 10\" (the live Fox broadcast ended 2 minutes longer than scheduled due to Harvey's mistake). This meant viewers in the Sacramento market were unable to see the apology and crowning of the winner. In addition, the newscast that followed made no mention of the incident at the pageant.\n\n"}

{"id": "1935636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935636", "title": "Healing environments", "text": "Healing environments\n\nHealing environment, for healthcare buildings describes a physical setting and organizational culture that supports patients and families through the stresses imposed by illness, hospitalization, medical visits, the process of healing, and sometimes, bereavement. The concept implies that the physical healthcare environment can make a difference in how quickly the patient recovers from or adapts to specific acute and chronic conditions.\n\nThe original concept of the healing environment was developed by Florence Nightingale whose theory of nursing called for nurses to manipulate the environment to be therapeutic (Nightingale, F. 1859). Nightingale outlined in detail the requirements of the \"sick room\" to minimize suffering and optimize the capacity of a patient to recover, including quiet, warmth, clean air, light, and good diet. Early healthcare design followed her theories outlined in her treatise, \"Notes on Hospitals.\". Following the discoveries by Louis Pasteur and others which lead to the Germ Theory, plus other technologies, the role of the environment was dominated by infection control and technological advances.\n\nStarting in the 1960s, healing environments have been linked with Evidence-based design (EBD), giving the concept a strong scientific base. While in some respects it can be said that the concept of healing environments has evolved into EBD, it's mainly in the area of reduction of stress that this overlap occurs; as EBD goes beyond the healing environments dimension to consider the effect of the built environment on patient clinical outcomes in the areas of staff stress and fatigue, patient stress, and facility operational efficiency and productivity to improve quality and\npatient safety. A 1984 study by Roger Ulrich found that surgical patients with a view of nature suffered fewer complications, used less pain medication and were discharged sooner than those who looked out on a brick wall. Since then, many studies have followed, showing impact of several environmental factors on several health outcomes.\n\nToday, the philosophy that guides the concept of the healing environment is rooted in research in the neurosciences, environmental psychology, psychoneuroimmunology, and evolutionary biology. The common thread linking these bodies of research is the physiological effects of stress on the individual and the ability to heal. Psychologically supportive environments enable patients and families to cope with and transcend illness.\n\nThe goal of creating a healing environment is to reduce stress, and thereby reduce associated problems such as medical error, inability to concentrate, and physical symptoms of stress that can affect logical thought process. While use of EBD techniques would not necessarily make an environment a healing one, through EBD we can define environmental factors that can help to ease stress and thereby result in a healing environment. Malkin emphasizes the contribution of research to concepts that can create a healing environment, but just the inclusion do not make setting a 'healing environment'. The design team needs to translate the EBD into design solutions unique to the individual hospital.\n\nAccording to \"The Business Case for Creating a Healing Environment\" written by Jain Malkin, the physical setting has the potential to be therapeutic if it achieves the following:\n\nThe most important thing for inpatients at hospitals is the comfort and normalcy of having family members and friends that visit and spend time with them. With advances in healthcare most patients are treated in an outpatient setting, where they come in have a procedure or test run and then go back to their homes. Today's inpatients are more likely to have a serious condition and be there for a period of at least several days and sometimes even months. This explains the growing trend of creating healthcare environments that make not only the patient, but also their loved ones feel like they can relax and maybe even forget that they're at the hospital. It is proven that if someone feels comfortable and relaxed, they can rest easier and heal faster.\n\nLighting Eighty percent of what we interpret of our surroundings comes to us from what we see of our environment and that is greatly affected by the light available in that environment. Lighting design in healthcare environments is a major factor in creating healing situations. Since the design of healthcare environments is said to influence patient's outcomes, yet high costs prevent most hospitals from renovating or rebuilding, changes in lighting becomes a cost-effective way to improve existing environments. It is proven that people who are surrounded by natural light are more productive and live healthier lives. When patients are sick, and surrounded by medical equipment and white walls, the last thing they need is a dark, stuffy room. This is why it is important for every room to have a window for natural light to come into and help create a healing environment for the patient.\n\nThe Auditory Environment While so much of the patient's experience is based on visual cues, the majority of meaning of their experience is auditory. The many sounds of a hospital are foreign to their experience and their line of sight is limited. Nightingale claimed that sounds that create \"anticipation, expectation, waiting, and fear of surprise ...damage the patient.\"(). Add to the perception and meaning attribute to any sound the factors of age-related hearing impairment common to older patients, heavy medication, pain, and other conditions, cognition is impacted as is the ability to understand language. Hospital noise, at any volume level, is credited with being the primary cause of sleep deprivation, a contributing factor in delirium, and a risk factor for errors. The current pressure to reduce noise at night has been mistakenly understood to mean undue quiet at night when patients most need cues that people are around them and available if they need help. Just s lighting must be designed to serve both day and night, so much the auditory environment be designed to support activity,cognition, rest, and sleep.\n\nAdding to the above, patients need positive visual and auditory stimulation. Nightingale called for variety, color, and form as a means of arousing creativity and health in patients. Currently, using appropriate art, nature imagery and music are found to improve the experience of the patient. Technologies have afforded patients infinite options to use media as the choose. The addition of beauty must also be accompanied by an attention to orderliness: removal of clutter, trash, and other distractions.\n\nMalkin, Jain; \"Healing Environments at the Century Mark: the Quest for Optimal Patient Experiences\"; unpublished article by summarizing a presentation given at a mini-course sponsored by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and The Center for Health Design, October 2003.\n\nMalkin, Jain; \"The Business Case for Creating a Healing Environment\"; published article written by Jain Malkin and published by The Center for Health Design, 2003\n\nSimeonova, M.

It is located at 3415 Redpath Street, on the corner of Sherbrooke Street (Route 138). It is in close proximity to the Golden Square Mile, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Concordia University (Sir George Williams Campus) as well as the Guy-Concordia Metro station.\n\nIt is the regimental church of The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada.\n\nThis congregation is the 1918 merger of two congregations, both formed in the early years of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe congregation formed in 1802 and was originally located on Notre-Dame Street. It was the second Presbyterian congregation in Montreal, the first having been the \"Scots Presbyterian Congregation\" of St. Gabriel Street Church, founded in 1787.\n\nIn 1809, the first St. Andrew's Church was built on Saint Peter Street in Old Montreal and was also known as \"St. Peter's Street Church\" at the time. In 1820, it became closer connected with the Church of Scotland. The new Saint Andrew's Church building was built in 1851 on Beaver Hall Hill, at the corner of De la Gauchetière Street. It was inspired by the plans of the Salisbury Cathedral, and was known as the \"Scottish Cathedral\". The cathedral burned to the ground in 1869 and was quickly rebuilt on the same location.\n\nIn 1875, St. Andrew's remained out of the merger that joined Canadian Presbyterians; instead, remaining with the Church of Scotland until their merger with St. Paul's Church in 1918. In 1927, the former church was demolished to make place for the head office of Bell Canada on Beaver Hall Hill.\n\nSt. Paul's Church was formed in 1832, as a result of another conflict at the pioneer \"St. Gabriel Street Church\", over the successor to Reverend James Somerville; between Reverend Robert Easton and Reverend Edward Black (both assistants to Sommerville). The conflict went over to Scotland, where it was encouraged that the Canadian Church of Scotland congregations form their own Synod to handle such matters. The result of this, in 1831, was to form a new congregation in Montreal and St. Paul's, under the leadership of Black was composed of the minority from St. Gabriel's. St. Gabriel's Church was placed under the leadership of Easton. \n\nIn 1834, a separate building for St. Paul's was constructed on Rue Sainte-Hélène. Designed by the architect John Wells, it was located on property owned by John Redpath and Peter McGill. It was demolished in 1868 and replaced by a commercial building.\nIn 1867, a new St. Paul's Church was built to the plans of architect Frederick Lawford on Dorchester Boulevard (now René Lévesque Boulevard) at the corner of Saint-Monique Street, where Place Ville-Marie and Central Station are located.\n\nIn 1870, this building served as the meeting place for the delegates from the 4 Canadian Presbyterian groups, that eventually merged in 1875. St Paul's gained a few St. Andrew's families who were supportive towards the Presbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nIn 1931, St. Paul's Church was slated to be demolished to make way for the construction of Central Station. It was saved from demolition by the Pères de Sainte-Croix who purchased the building for the symbolic sum of $1. Over sixty days it was dismantled stone by stone and moved to the grounds of the Collège Saint-Laurent. It was reassembled by architect Lucien Parent who modified the church slightly for its new role as a Roman Catholic church. It was also raised by one floor to allow for a theatre, \"Salle Émile-Legault\" to be built underneath. The theatre was home to the well-known Compagnons de Saint-Laurent French-language theatre troupe. It became vacant following the secularization of the institution, and was converted into a museum in 1979. The Musée des maîtres et artisans du Québec is today located in what was originally St. Paul's Church.\n\nThe present building was constructed on Sherbrooke Street at the corner of Redpath, and opened in 1932. The idea to build this church came about in 1918 following the merger of two separate Presbyterian congregations formed in the 19th century.\n\nIt was designed in the Gothic Revival architecture style largely by Montreal draftsman H. Ross Wiggs who worked for the firm of Harold Lea Fetherstonhaugh. The materials used in construction were steel and reinforced concrete, although the interior is made entirely of stone. Built in the style of a cathedral, the interior of the church has three aisles. A large stained glass window overlooks the main communion table. There are also two windows made by William Morris who was associated with the English Arts and Crafts Movement. The wrought iron screen located in one of the chapels won an award for the architect, Fetherstonhaugh. Many of the commemorative stained glass windows within the church originated from the former St. Paul Church.\n\nThe church's organ was built in 1932 by Casavant Frères, and is the largest in Montreal with 7000 organ pipes.\n\nThe building is 67 meters (220 feet) long, and the exterior tower is 41 metres (135 feet) high.\n\n\n\n\nSince 1825, there have been many assistant and associate ministers connected with these congregations, as well as Presbyterian College students:\nOn October 29, 2006, Rev. Steve Filyk was ordained and Inducted to this position; he had also served in this congregation as a student at Presbyterian College. In 2008, he was called to Kerrisdale Church in Vancouver. Rev. Rod. Ferguson came to the congregation as an Interim Minister during the last Vacancy. He remained on after Rev. Veenstra's Induction.\n+ -died in office\n\n"}
{"id": "1935651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935651", "title": "Pyotr Lavrov", "text": "Pyotr Lavrov\n\nPyotr Lavrovich Lavrov (; alias Mirtov (); (June 2 (June 14 N.S.), 1823 – January 25 (February 6 N.S.), 1900) was a prominent Russian theorist of narodism, philosopher, publicist, revolutionary and sociologist.\n\nHe entered a military academy and graduated in 1842 as an army officer. He became well-versed in natural science, history, logic, philosophy, and psychology. He was also an instructor in mathematics for two decades.\n\nLavrov joined the revolutionary movement as a radical in 1862. His actions led to his being exiled to the Ural Mountains in 1868 from which he soon escaped and fled abroad. In France, he lived mostly in Paris, where he became a member of the Anthropological Society. Lavrov had been attracted to European socialist ideas early on, though at first he did not know how they applied to Russia. While he was in Paris, Lavrov fully committed himself to the revolutionary socialist movement. He became a member of the Ternes section of the International Workingmen's Association in 1870. He was also present at the start of the Paris Commune, and soon went abroad to generate international support.\n\nLavrov arrived in Zürich in November 1872, and became a rival of Mikhail Bakunin's in the \"Russian Colony\". In Zürich he lived in the Frauenfeld house near the university. Lavrov tended more toward reform than revolution, or at least saw reform as salutary. He preached against the conspiratorial ideology of Peter Tkachev and others like him. Lavrov believed that while a coup d'état would be easy in Russia, the creation of a socialist society needed to involve the Russian masses. He founded the journal \"Forward!\" in 1872, its first issue appearing in August 1873. Lavrov used this journal to publicize his analysis of Russia's peculiar historical development.\n\nLavrov was a prolific writer for more than 40 years. His works include \"The Hegelian Philosophy\" (1858–59) and \"Studies in the Problems of Practical Philosophy\" (1860). While living in exile, he edited his Socialist review, \"Forward!\". A contribution to the revolutionary cause, \"Historical Letters\" (1870) was written under the pseudonym Mirtov. The letters greatly influenced the revolutionary activity in Russia. He was called \"Peter Lawroff\" in \"\" (1899–1900) by K. Tarassoff.\n\nIn Peter Lavrov's view, socialism was the natural outcome of Western European historical development. He believed that the bourgeois mode of production planted the seeds of its own destruction. \"Lavrov began his revolutionary career with the assumption that the future belonged to West European scientific socialism, as created by material conditions of West European civilization.\" Lavrov recognized that Russia's historical development was significantly different from that of Western Europe, though he still maintained hope that Russia might join in the greater European socialist movement.\n\nIn Lavrov's analysis of Russia's historical development, he concluded that the essence of Russia's peculiarity rested on the fact that they had not experienced feudalism and all of its progressive features. Russia had been isolated from European development by the Mongol conquest in the thirteenth century. In 1870, Lavrov published a comparison of the levels of economic, political and social development of several Western European nations and Russia, noting the relatively backward and poor condition of Russia.\n\nDespite Lavrov's historical analysis, he still believed a socialist revolution was possible in Russia. One of his contemporaries, Georgi Plekhanov, believed that a socialist revolution would only come with the development of a revolutionary workers’ party. In other words, he believed that Russia would have to wait for the same historical development experienced by the West. Lavrov rejected this outlook, believing it possible to create socialism by basing revolutionary tactics on Russia's individual history. Almost 90 percent of Russia's population were peasants, and there was also the intelligentsia: a unique bunch of people without any class affiliations, who, \"unlike other elements of Russian society, were unflawed by the past.\"\n\nThus, Lavrov felt that a true socialist revolution would have to integrate the rural population in order to succeed. Lavrov considered the intelligentsia the only portion of society capable of preparing Russia for participation in a worldwide socialist revolution. He gave them the task of compensating for the shortfalls of Russian historical development by organizing the people, teaching them scientific socialism, and finally, preparing to take up arms with the people when the time would come.\n\nIn his “Historical Letters” Lavrov accentuated the indissoluble connection between sociology as a science and basic principles of individual morality. According to him, sociological knowledge always depends upon scholars’ consciously chosen ideals. The majority of researchers stress the heterogeneity of Lavrov's ideas as well as the fact that a considerable impact was made upon him both by the leaders of the positivist tradition and by Marx. All those impacts were in some way synthesized in Lavrov's idea of solidarity as the key issue of sociological research. Lavrov defined sociology as a science dealing with forms of social solidarity, which he subdivided into three major types:\n- unconscious solidarity of custom; \n- purely emotional solidarity, based on impulses not controlled by critical reflection;\n- “conscious historical solidarity” resulting from a common effort to attain a consciously selected and rationally justified goal. \nThe latter represented the highest and the most significant type of human solidarity. It developed later than the first two types and proclaimed the conversion of the static “culture” into the dynamic “civilization.” To sum it up, social solidarity in Lavrov's view is “the consciousness that personal interest coincides with social interest, that personal dignity is maintained only by upholding the dignity of all who share in this solidarity”. Otherwise it is a mere community of habits, interests, affects, or convictions. Thus solidarity is an essential premise of the existence of society. Solidary interaction distinguishes society from a simple gathering of individuals, the latter phenomenon constituting no sociological object. Moreover, the condition of individuals being conscious creatures excludes from the field of sociology forms of solidarity / solidary interaction performed by unconscious organisms, or, in other words, marks the borderline between social and biological phenomena.\n\n"}

It is one of the most expensive coffees in the world. Only coffee from the Kona Districts can be described as \"Kona\". The weather of sunny mornings, cloud or rain in the afternoon, little wind, and mild nights combined with porous, mineral-rich volcanic soil create favorable coffee growing conditions. The loanword for coffee in the Hawaiian language is \"kope,\" pronounced .\n\nThe coffee plant was brought to the Kona district in 1828 by Samuel Reverend Ruggles from Brazilian cuttings. \nEnglish merchant Henry Nicholas Greenwell moved to the area and established Kona coffee as a recognized brand later in the 19th century. The former Greenwell Store and Kona Coffee Living History Farm have since become museums.\n\nIn other parts of the Hawaiian islands, it was grown on large plantations, but the 1899 world coffee market crash caused plantation owners to lease land to their workers. Most were from Japan, brought to work on sugarcane plantations. They worked their leased parcels of between 5 and as family concerns, producing large, quality crops.\n\nThe tradition of family farms continued throughout Kona. The Japanese-origin families have been joined by Filipinos, mainland Americans, and Europeans. There are approximately 800 Kona coffee farms, with an average size of less than . In 1997 the total Kona coffee area was and green coffee production just over two million pounds.\n\nKona coffee blooms in February and March. Small white flowers known as \"Kona snow\" cover the tree. Green berries appear in April. By late August, red fruit, called \"cherry\" because of resemblance to a cherry, start to ripen for picking. Each tree, hand-picked several times between August and January, provides around 15 pounds of cherry, which result in about two pounds of roasted coffee.\n\nWithin 24 hours of picking, the cherry is run through a pulper. The beans are separated from the pulp and then placed overnight in a fermentation tank. The fermentation time is about 12 hours at low elevation or 24 at higher elevation. The beans are rinsed and spread to dry on a \"hoshidana\" or drying rack. Traditional hoshidanas have a rolling roof to cover the beans in rain. It takes seven to 14 days to dry beans to an optimal moisture level of between 10 and 13% (by Hawaii Department of Agriculture regulations: 9.0-12.0%). Too much moisture content in coffee allows the growth of ochratoxin A, a harmful mycotoxin, hazardous to human health. From here, the beans are stored as \"pergamino\" or parchment. The parchment is milled off the green bean prior to roasting or wholesale.\nKona coffee beans are classified by law according to seed. Type I beans consist of two beans per cherry, flat on one side, oval on the other. Type II beans consist of one round bean per cherry, otherwise known as peaberries. Further grading of these two types of beans depends on size, moisture content, and purity of bean type. The grades of type I Kona coffee are 'Kona Extra Fancy', 'Kona Fancy', 'Kona Number 1', 'Kona Select', and 'Kona Prime'. The grades of type II Kona coffee are 'Peaberry Number 1' and 'Peaberry Prime'. Also, a lower grade of coffee, called 'Number 3' (or 'Triple X') can not legally be labeled as \"Kona\" but as 'Hawaiian' coffee. Any bean grade below Number 3 is considered 'Offgrade' coffee and can only be labeled as generic coffee. Not an official classification grade, but commonly used by Kona coffee farmers, is the 'Estate' grade where the various grades are not being separated from each other. Only the 'Number 3' and 'Offgrade' beans are being sorted out.\n\nInfestations of the root-knot nematode damaged many trees in the Kona districts in the 1990s. Symptoms are single or clusters of trees with stunted growth, especially when transplanted.\nIn 2001 rootstock from the \"Coffea liberica\" species was found to be resistant to the nematodes. It could be grafted with \"Coffea arabica\" 'Guatemala' variety to produce a plant that naturally resists the pest, still producing a quality coffee product. The combination was named after Edward T. Fukunaga (1910–1984), who was superintendent of the University of Hawaii's Kona Research Station in Kainaliu in the 1950s through the 1970s.\n\nBecause of the rarity and price of Kona coffee, some retailers sell \"Kona Blends\". These are not a combination of different Kona coffees, but a blend of Kona and Colombian, Brazilian, or other foreign coffees. Usually they contain only the minimum required 10% Kona coffee and 90% cheaper imported beans.\n\nCurrent Hawaiian law requires blends to state only the percentage of Kona coffee on the label but not any other coffee origins. There is no matching Federal law. Some retailers use terms such as 'Kona Roast' or 'Kona Style'. To be considered authentic Kona coffee, the state of Hawaii's labeling laws require the prominent display of the words \"100% Kona Coffee\".\n\nIn 1993 the Kona Coffee Council, a regional coffee growers association, tried unsuccessfully to protect the name \"Kona Coffee\" by trademarking their logo with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. They were opposed by Kona Kai Farms, Inc, Captain Cook Coffee Co., Hawaiian Isles Enterprises, and Hawaii Coffee Company. In 2000 the Department of Agriculture of the State of Hawaii registered a \"100% Kona Coffee\" certification mark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Administration in regard to this certification mark was handed over by the State Department of Agriculture to the Hawaii Coffee Company, part of Topa Equities Ltd, based in Los Angeles.\n\nKona coffee farmers launched a class action lawsuit against some of the largest retailers in the USA on Feb. 27, 2019. The Lanham Act permits a civil action for, among other reasons, “false designation of origin.\" Walmart, Costco, Amazon, Safeway, and Kroger are among the sellers and producers of 19 brands of supposedly Kona coffee that have been named in the complaint. \n\nIn the 1990s, a company called Kona Kai Farms, in Berkeley, California, was sued on behalf of Kona coffee growers. In October 1996, federal officials in San Francisco indicted Kona Kai Farms executive Michael Norton on wire fraud and money laundering charges. He was found to have put Central American coffee into bags with labels indicating it was Kona coffee since 1993.\nIn 2000 Michael Norton pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of tax evasion. In 2007 his two sons were arrested in a multimillion-dollar medical marijuana scam.\n\nSome Kona farms have become successful tourist attractions. Although some roadside stands are allowed with special permits, large gift shops at some areas that are zoned agricultural have met local resistance.\nFormer Mayor of Hawaii County Stephen Yamashiro, who served from 1992 to 2000, is credited with introducing the \"100% Kona Coffee\" logo and emblem now used by the industry.\n\nCoffee berry borer (\"Hypothenemus hampei\"), the most harmful beetle to the \"arabica\" coffee crop, was discovered in Kona coast plantations in September 2010 by a graduate student of the University of Hawaii. How the tiny beetle got to Kona is unknown, but the size of the infestation indicates it has been going for a few years. Some growers suspected severe drought conditions had reduced the fungus \"Beauveria bassiana\", which might have kept the beetle population under control for years.\n\nBy late November 2010, the Hawaii Department of Agriculture declared a quarantine on all green (unroasted) beans leaving the island. Fumigation with a chemical such as methyl bromide or a six-step procedure was required. The price of Kona coffee was expected to rise, up to a possible $50 per pound by December 2010, if the infestation lingers or spreads, because the insect has the potential to reduce crop yields up to 90%. In early 2011 the Hawaii State Dept. of Agriculture allowed the import and application of a concentrated naturally occurring fungus (\"beauveria bassiana\") to successfully combat the infestation.\n\n\n\n"}

The valley is bounded on the southwest by the Pir Panjal Range and on the northeast by the main Himalayas range. It is approximately long and wide, and drained by the Jhelum River.\n\nThe Kashmir Division is a revenue and administrative division of the Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. The Kashmir division borders Jammu Division to the south and Ladakh to the east while Line of Control forms its northern and the western border. The division consists of the following districts: Anantnag, Baramulla, Budgam, Bandipore, Ganderbal, Kupwara, Kulgam, Pulwama, Shopian and Srinagar.\n\nIn the first half of the 1st millennium A.D, the Kashmir region became an important centre of Hinduism and later of Buddhism; later still, in the ninth century, Kashmir Shaivism arose. In 1339, Shah Mir became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the \"Salatin-i-Kashmir\" or Swati dynasty. For the next five centuries, Muslim monarchs ruled Kashmir, including the Mughals, who ruled from 1526 until 1751, and the Afghan Durrani Empire, which ruled from 1747 until 1819. That year, the Sikhs, under Ranjit Singh, annexed Kashmir. In 1846, after the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo-Sikh War, and upon the purchase of the region from the British under the Treaty of Amritsar, the Raja of Jammu, Gulab Singh, became the ruler of a new State of Jammu and Kashmir. The rule of his descendants, under the paramountcy (or tutelage) of the British Crown, lasted until 1947. In that year, facing a rebellion in the western districts of the state as well as an invasion by Pashtun tribes instigated by the Dominion of Pakistan, the Maharaja of the princely state signed the Instrument of Accession, joining the Dominion of India. Subsequently, he transferred power to a popular government headed by Sheikh Abdullah.\n\nFollowing this, a war ensued between India and Pakistan. The territory of the state, however, has been the centre of a dispute ever since, now administered by three countries: India, Pakistan, and the People's Republic of China, the latter having taken control of Aksai Chin in 1964.\nKashmir valley is however fully under the control of India and is about in area which is about 15.73% of the total area under Indian control.\n\nThe major ethnic group of Kashmir Valley are Kashmiris and they speak the Kashmiri language. Smaller ethno-linguistic groups include the Gujjars and Bakarwals who mostly live along mountain ranges of the Valley. The Valley has a Muslim majority population and Islam is practiced by 97.16% of the population with the remaining being Hindus (1.84%), Sikhs (0.88%), Buddhists (0.11%) and others.\nThe principal spoken languages in the valley are Kashmiri and Urdu, with Urdu being the official language. Many speakers of these languages also know English as a second language.\n\nKashmir Division consists of ten districts:\n\nSrinagar is its main city and also the summer capital of the state. Other main cities are :Baramulla, :Anantnag,\nPulwama.\n\nThe major political parties in the region are the National Conference, the Jammu and Kashmir People's Democratic Party and the Congress. Bharatiya Janata Party has very little presence in Kashmir Valley but is dominant in the Hindu-majority Jammu region. Srinagar in the valley is the summer capital of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The capital moves out of the valley in the winter to Jammu in a grand ceremony called Darbar Move.\n\nKashmir Valley has a moderate climate, which is largely defined by its geographic location, with the towering Karakoram Range in the north, Pir Panjal Range in the south and west and Zanskar Range in the east. It can be generally described as cool in the spring and autumn, mild in the summer and cold in the winter. As a large valley with significant differences in geo-location among various districts, the weather is often cooler in the hilly areas compared to the flat lower part.\n\nSummer is usually mild and fairly dry, but relative humidity is generally high and the nights are cool. The precipitation occurs throughout the year and no month is particularly dry. The hottest month is July (mean minimum temperature 16 °C, mean maximum temperature 32 °C) and the coldest are December–January (mean minimum temperature −15 °C, mean maximum temperature 0 °C).\n\nCompared with other plain parts of India, Kashmir valley enjoys a more moderate climate but weather conditions are unpredictable. The recorded high temperature is 33 °C and the recorded low is −18 °C. On 5 and 6 January 2012, after years of relatively little snow, a wave of heavy snow and low temperatures (winter storm) shocked the valley covering it in a thick layer of snow and ice.\n\nKashmir Valley has seen an increase in relative humidity and annual precipitation in the last few years. This is most likely because of the commercial afforestation projects which also include expanding parks and green cover.\n\nKashmir valley is a popular tourist destination for domestic and foreign tourists. Among the popular tourist places in the valley are Gulmarg that has a ski resort, Dal Lake that has popular house boats, Pahalgam and the major Hindu shrine Amarnath Temple.\n\nBefore insurgency intensified in 1989, tourism formed an important part of the Kashmiri economy. As a result, the tourism economy in the Kashmir valley was worst hit. Thousands of Hindu pilgrims visit holy shrine of Amarnath every year and this significantly benefits the state's economy. \n\nTourism in the Kashmir valley had rebounded at the turn of the century. In 2009, the state became one of the top tourist destinations of India. Gulmarg, one of the most popular ski resort destinations in India, is also home to the world's highest green golf course. However, with the decrease in violence in the state has boosted the states economy specifically tourism. It was reported that 736,000 tourists including 23,000 foreigners visited Kashmir in 2010.\nOther tourist places include Sonamarg, Kokernag, Verinag, Aharabal and Semthan-Top.\n\n\n\n\nThis Himalayan valley provides a base to climb some of the challenging Himalayan peaks. These peaks were closed due to the rise in militancy, now they are opened for mountaineering.\n\nKashmiri cuisine includes dum aloo (boiled potatoes hollowed and stuffed with heavy amounts of spice), tzaman (a solid cottage cheese), rogan josh (lamb cooked in heavy spices), yakhiyn (lamb cooked in curd with mild spices), hakh (kohlrabi greens), rista-gushtaba (minced meat balls in tomato and curd curry), danival korme and the signature rice. The traditional wazwan feast involves cooking meat or vegetables, usually mutton, in several different ways.\n\nAlcohol is not consumed by many Muslims in the valley. There are two styles of making tea in the region: Noon Chai or salt tea that is pink in colour (known as chinen posh rang or peach flower colour) and popular with locals, and kahwah, a tea for festive occasions, made with saffron and spices (cardamom, cinnamon, sugar, noon chai leaves) and black tea.\n\nKashmir valley is connected to Jammu and Ladakh regions by road and air. It has access to Jammu region and the rest of India through the Banihal road tunnel near Qazigund on national highway NH 1A and through NH 1B that passes through Sinthan pass and Kishtwar.\n\nSrinagar is the main airport in Kashmir valley and has scheduled flights from Jammu, Leh, Mumbai, Chandigarh and New Delhi. Kashmir valley has a long modern railway line that started in October 2009 and connects Baramulla in the western part of the valley to Srinagar and Qazigund. It further links the Kashmir Valley to Banihal across the Pir Panjal mountains through the new 11.215 km (7 mile) long Pir Panjal Railway Tunnel or Banihal rail tunnel from 26 June 2013. Banihal railway station will be linked to the rest of India in another few years as the construction of the railway line from Jammu to Banihal progresses steadily. Transport within the valley is predominantly by road.Other airports are in Udhampur, Leh and Jammu. Another airport is proposed in Anantnag.\n\n\n"}

Based in Malta, upon the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War she was active in joint patrols enforcing the non-intervention policy, periodically in co-operation with \"Deutschland\" and Italian destroyers. Later deployed in Alexandria, she remained on alert in course of the Italian invasion of Abissynia. In ths spring and summer of 1938 on refit in Devonport, she was recommissioned for the Mediterranean, deployed at Malta and Alexandria. On 29 March 1939 in Gandia \"Galatea\" took on board the leader of the National Defence Council colonel Segismundo Casado and his entourage; the following day she sailed off and on 31 March Casado was transferred to the hospital ship \"Maine\".\n\nAfter the outbreak of Second World War she was ordered home, and between February and March 1940 she took part in the operations to intercept Axis merchantmen attempting to break out of Vigo. In April 1940 she was involved in the Norwegian Campaign, leaving on 25 April transporting part of the Norwegian National Treasury to Britain, and in May joined the Nore Command as Flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron.\n\nOn 4 April 1940, the Polish destroyers , and reached their new homebase Rosyth. In the afternoon they left the harbour with \"Galatea\", her sister ship and three destroyers. They were ordered to conduct a patrol in the North Sea and were later ordered to intercept German invasion groups heading for Norway.\n\nArriving at Åndalsnes in late April with troops for the norwegian campaign she returned to Rosyth with 200 crates, weighing 40 kiloes each, from the norwegian national treasury.\n\nIn June 1940 she was involved in the Operation Ariel evacuation of troops from Saint-Jean-de-Luz France, including Sir Ronald Hugh Campbell, the British Ambassador to France.\n\nOn 7 September 1940 the code word Cromwell was issued meaning that the Germans might land in Kent at dawn. During that night \"Galatea\" was sent to patrol the Straits of Dover but made no contact with the enemy. At dawn while returning to port she struck a mine off Sheerness and spent three months in dry dock.\n\nShe remained with the Home Fleet (under refit, between October 1940 to January 1941) until May 1941, and was involved in hunting the . In July 1941 she joined the Mediterranean Fleet via the Red Sea, and by November was based at Malta with Force \"K\", operating against the Axis supply convoys to North Africa.\n\nOn 15 December 1941 before midnight \"Galatea\" (Captain E.W.B. Sim) was torpedoed and sunk by the off Alexandria, Egypt. Captain Sim, 22 officers and 447 ratings were killed. Some 100 survivors were picked up by the destroyers and . Less than 48 hours later, \"U-557\" was rammed by the Italian torpedo boat \"Orione\" and sunk with all hands.\n\nAuthor Ian Fleming named the character Gala Brand in his third James Bond novel “Moonraker” after the vessel, her Royal Navy father’s ship.\n\n\n"}

It was a light, basic style with no windshield, top, or doors and a single row of seats. Runabouts eventually became indistinguishable from roadsters and the term fell out of use in the United States. The approach has evolved into the modern \"city car\".\n\nThe runabout was a light, inexpensive, open car with basic bodywork and no windshield, top, or doors. Most runabouts had just a single row of seats, providing seating for two passengers. Some also had a rumble seat at the rear to provide optional seating for one or two more passengers; those without rumble seats may have had a trunk platform, a box, or a fuel tank instead. They differed from buggies and high wheelers mainly by having smaller wheels.\n\nEarly runabouts had their engines under the body toward the middle of the chassis. This sometimes made maintenance difficult, as on the Oldsmobile Curved Dash where the body had to be removed in order to access the engine. The Gale runabout dealt with this problem by hinging the body at the rear of the car such that it could be tilted to access the engine. Some later runabouts had the engine in what became the conventional position at the front of the car.\nRunabouts were popular in North America from the late 19th century to about 1915. They were designed for light use over short distances. By the mid-1910s, they became almost indistinguishable from roadsters.\n\nNotable examples of runabouts include the Oldsmobile Curved Dash mentioned earlier, which was the first mass-produced car, and the Cadillac runabout, which won the Dewar Trophy for 1908 by demonstrating its use of interchangeable parts.\n\nThe 1964 GM Runabout was a three wheel concept car first exhibited at Futurama II, part of the 1964 New York World's Fair. The car was designed specifically for housewives and had detachable shopping carts built into it.\n\nThe term \"runabout\" is still in use in the UK, denoting a small car used for short journeys.\n\n"}

In spite of the name \"Swiss roll\", the cake is believed to have originated elsewhere in Central Europe, likely Austria. It appears to have been invented in the nineteenth century, along with Battenberg, doughnuts, and Victoria sponge.\n\nThe spiral layered shape of the Swiss roll has inspired usage as a descriptive term in other fields, such as in optics and many forms of the term \"jelly roll\".\n\nThe earliest published reference for a rolled cake spread with jelly was in the \"Northern Farmer\", a journal published in Utica, New York, in December 1852. Called \"To Make Jelly Cake\", the recipe describes a modern \"jelly roll\" and reads: \"Bake quick and while hot spread with jelly. Roll carefully, and wrap it in a cloth. When cold cut in slices for the table.\"\n\nThe terminology evolved in America for many years. From 1852 to 1877 such a dessert was called: Jelly Cake (1852), Roll Jelly Cake (1860), Swiss Roll (1872), Jelly Roll (1873), and Rolled Jelly Cake (1876). The name “Jelly Roll” was eventually adopted.\n\n\"Roll Sandwich or Swiss Pudding\" appears in the second edition of \"The complete biscuit and gingerbread baker's assistant\" in 1854.\n\nThe origin of the term \"Swiss roll\" is unknown. The earliest British reference to a baked item by that name appeared in the Birmingham Journal for Saturday 10 May 1856, page 8, in an advert for Thomas Richards of 71 New Street, Birmingham, where he had '… the patronage bestowed on him for the last fourteen years as the maker of the celebrated Pork Pies, Swiss Rolls, French Pies, German & Genoa Cakes, Grantham and other Ginger Bread for which he defies competition …' The inference is that Swiss rolls may date to 1842 in England.\n\nA rolled cake appeared on a bill of fare dated 18 June 1871, published in the 1872 book \"A Voyage from Southampton to Cape Town, in the Union Company’s Mail Steamer “Syria”\" (London). A recipe for \"Swiss roll\" also appeared in the US that same year in \"The American Home Cook Book\", published in Detroit, Michigan, in 1872.\n\nSeveral 1880s to 1890s cookbooks from London, England, used the name Swiss roll exclusively.\n\nThe \"American Pastry Cook\", published in Chicago in 1894, presented a basic \"Jelly Roll Mixture\" then listed variants made from it that included a Swiss roll, Venice roll, Paris roll, chocolate roll, jelly roll cotelettes, and decorated jelly rolls.\n\nIn the Czech Republic the Swiss roll is called \"piškotová roláda\".\n\nThe origin of this cake is likely the UK, since Hong Kong was an integral British territory from the 19th century to 1997. The cake is never pre-packaged, as it is sold fresh daily in the Chinese bakeries. Overall, this cake has been sold next to other Chinese pastries well before the popularising of Western-style bakeries such as Maxim. There are several popular variations.\n\nMost US Chinatown bakeries sell the basic Hong Kong Swiss roll version. It essentially looks and tastes identical to the one sold in Hong Kong. A popular flavour in Chinese bakeries in the US is the tiger roll, which has a coffee-flavoured golden-esque striped outer appearance, and is chocolate-coloured or light-coloured, with traditional white cream inside. It is similar to the look of a tiger bread.\n\nIn India, Swiss rolls are called \"jam rolls\".\n\nIn Indonesia, the Swiss roll cake is called \"bolu gulung\". Most bakeries sell Swiss rolls daily, and they are filled with butter cream, cheese or fruit jam. It is also very common for Swiss rolls to be sold by the slice, but some shops sell by both slice and roll.\n\nIn Sicily around Caltanissetta (Italy), there is a food made with \"sponge ciccolato\", ricotta cheese, and marzipan called the \"rollò\".\n\nIn Japan, Swiss rolls are called \"roll cake\". They are filled with whipped cream and sometimes with fruits like strawberries.\n\nIn Colombia, a Swiss roll is called either \"pionono\" or \"brazo de reina\" (\"queen's arm\"), and it is filled with \"dulce de guayaba\" (guava jam) or arequipe. In Argentina, Uruguay, and Peru, it is also called \"pionono\", and it is filled with \"dulce de leche manjar blanco\" (\"sweet milk white delicacy\"). In Chile it is called \"brazo de reina\", filled with \"dulce de leche\" only, and sprinkled with powdered sugar.\n\nIn Puerto Rico and Venezuela it is known as \"brazo de gitano\", but there is a vast array of fillings that include cream, chocolate truffle, \"dulce de guayaba\", \"dulce de leche manjar blanco\", often combined with fruits. In Brazil, it is called \"rocambole\". In Mexico it is called \"nino envuelto\" (\"wrapped child\"). In Ecuador and Guatemala it is known as a \"brazo gitano\" (\"gypsy's arm\").\n\nVarieties produced in Southeast Asia include kaya, pandan, blueberry, strawberry, sweet potato, taro, vanilla, orange, chocolate, raspberry, and even local fruits like durian, cempedak, and mango.\n\nIn the Philippines, the most similar traditional pastry is the \"pionono\" which is part of the regular offerings of neighborhood bakeries since the Spanish colonial period. It is a rolled variant of the traditional Filipino sponge cakes (\"mamón\") and similarly originally has a very simple filling of sugar and butter (or margarine). Modern versions, however, are commonly frosted and can include a variety of fillings. A very popular variant is the \"pianono\" version of the ube cake generally known as \"ube rolls\". It is flavored with \"ube\" (purple yam) and \"macapuno\", giving it a characteristic vivid purple color. Mango \"pianono\" or \"mango roll\", a variant of the mango cake, are also popular and are made with ripe Carabao mangoes and cream. Another notable traditional \"pianono\" is the \"brazo de Mercedes\" (\"arm of Our Lady of Mercy\"), composed of a soft meringue body and a custard core. Due to American influence, \"pianonos\" are more commonly called \"cake rolls\" in modern times.\n\nIn Portugal, desserts called \"tortas\" are commonly found on restaurant menus. Such desserts are not tarts, nor are they similar to German \"torte\". They are simply Swiss rolls with jam filling.\n\nIn Denmark, Norway, and Sweden the Swiss roll is called \"roulade\", \"rullade\", or \"rulltårta\". An alternative Norwegian name is \"rullekake\" or, in some parts of the country, \"swissrull\".\n\nIn Sweden and Finland, the Swiss roll is called \"rulltårta\", respectively \"kääretorttu\" (both meaning \"roll-cake\"), and it is commonly served with coffee. The filling often consists of butter cream and strawberry jam. The base of a chocolate version, called \"drömrulltårta\" (\"dream roll-cake\"), is made mostly of potato flour, instead of the typical wheat flour, and it is filled with butter cream. More elaborate versions of the Swiss roll can be found in bakeries, with, for example, whipped cream and a crushed banana rolled in the middle, or with a thin marzipan coating that resembles a birch log.\n\nIn Spain, the dessert is called \"brazo de gitano\" (literally translated as \"gypsy's arm\") and is commonly filled with cream or chocolate truffle.\n\nDespite its name, the Swiss roll did not originate in Switzerland. Swiss rolls are called \"Biskuitroulade\" or \"Roulade\" in Swiss Standard German, \"gâteau roulé\" or \"roulade\" in French, and \"biscotto arrotolato\" in Italian.\n\nIn the UK, Swiss rolls are popular at teatime or as a dessert. A variety of Swiss rolls are available on sale in supermarkets in the United Kingdom, such as chocolate Swiss rolls, lemon Swiss rolls or jam Swiss rolls; these all have different colours. Jam Swiss rolls will be filled with jam and also possibly cream, with a sugar outer coating. Chocolate Swiss rolls are made in Great Britain in a similar way to the United States version. Cadbury produces a Swiss roll in the form of a cake bar coated in chocolate. Jam roly-poly is a similar dessert, but made as a suet pudding rather than a cake, filled with jam and served hot with custard.\n\nAmerican pastry chefs and menus in fine dining restaurants often use the French term \"roulade\". The chocolate Swiss roll, sometimes called a \"chocolate log\", is a popular snack. Produced by many commercial bakeries, common brands include Ho Hos and Yodels, which are smaller-sized rolls for individual consumption. When the filling is ice cream, it is commonly referred to as an \"ice cream cake roll\", and although they can vary, these often consist of chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.\n\n"}

He was succeeded by another former Chaplain, George Henry.\n\nWith the 1763 Treaty, and the coming of merchants from Scotland and New England, the congregation soon assumed civilian status and was known as the \"Scotch Congregation - in connection with the Church of Scotland\".\n\nDuring the 1802 ministry of Alexander Spark, in response to a petition signed by 148 persons, the present Church site was granted by His Majesty George III, although it was not until 1807 that construction began.\n\nThe long-contemplated Church was dedicated on November 30, 1810, on St. Andrew's Day, and appropriately named after the apostle. The building remains virtually unchanged but for the addition of the Vestry in 1900.\n\nOn the same triangular site with the church are the Kirk Hall, first erected in 1829 as a Protestant School which continued as a flourishing scholastic institution for many years; and the magnificent Manse erected in 1837, which was the residence of the ministers until 2017. William Reed was notably the church's organist from 1900-1913.\n\n+Died in Office.\n\n"}

Medically, such \"beauty marks\" are generally melanocytic nevus, more specifically the compound variant. Moles of this type may also be located elsewhere on the body, and may also be considered beauty marks if located on the face, shoulder, neck or breast. Artificial beauty marks have been fashionable in some periods.\n\nArtificial beauty marks, or mouches (\"Fr.\" flies), became fashionable in sixteenth-century France, and the fashion persisted into the eighteenth century. When the fashion spread to Spain and the Spanish Empire they were called a chiqueador. \n\nA mouche was generally made of silk or velvet and was applied to the face as a form of make-up. They were Kept in a patch box, or boîte à mouches (\"Fr.\" box of flies), and were often fanciful shapes such as hearts or stars. Besides their decorative value, the patches could hide smallpox scars or syphilis sores. \n\nAlexander Pope's 1712 poem \"The Rape of the Lock\" mentions such patches as indicators of \"secular love\":\n\n<poem>Here Files of Pins extend their shining Rows,\nPuffs, Powders, Patches, Bibles, Billet-doux.\nNow awful Beauty puts on all its Arms;\nThe Fair each moment rises in her Charms,\nRepairs her Smiles, awakens ev'ry Grace,\nAnd calls forth all the Wonders of her Face;</poem>\n\nThe Monroe piercing has gained popularity in recent years as a flexible way of approximating a beauty mark. Natural beauty marks are also often enhanced with color from an eyebrow pencil or pen.\n\nMany female sex symbols, actresses, and other celebrities are known for their beauty marks:\n\n\n\nA few male actors are also known for their beauty marks:\n\nIn the conclusion of the book \"The Silence of the Lambs\", the heroine Clarice Starling gains an artificial beauty mark when burnt gunpowder gets lodged in the flesh of her cheek. She retains this mark in the sequel novel \"Hannibal\". This symbolism (along with Dr. Lecter's polydactylism) did not get carried over into the film.\n\nJoan Crawford had a prominent beauty mark in her role as Sadie Thompson in \"Rain\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1935740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935740", "title": "Extremely Large Telescope", "text": "Extremely Large Telescope\n\nThe Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) is an astronomical observatory currently under construction. When completed, it is planned to be the world's largest optical/near-infrared extremely large telescope. Part of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) agency, it is located on top of Cerro Armazones in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. The design consists of a reflecting telescope with a segmented primary mirror and a diameter secondary mirror, and will be supported by adaptive optics, eight laser guide star units and multiple large science instruments. The observatory aims to gather 100 million times more light than the human eye, 13 times more light than the largest optical telescopes existing in 2014, and be able to correct for atmospheric distortion. It has around 256 times the light gathering area of the Hubble Space Telescope and, according to the ELT's specifications, would provide images 16 times sharper than those from Hubble. The project was originally called the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), but the name was shortened in 2017.\n\nThe ELT is intended to advance astrophysical knowledge by enabling detailed studies of planets around other stars, the first galaxies in the Universe, supermassive black holes, and the nature of the Universe's dark sector, and to detect water and organic molecules in protoplanetary disks around other stars. The facility is expected to take 11 years to construct.\n\nOn 11 June 2012, the ESO Council approved the ELT programme's plans to begin civil works at the telescope site, with construction of the telescope itself pending final agreement with governments of some member states. Construction work on the ELT site started in June 2014. By December 2014, ESO had secured over 90% of the total funding and authorized construction of the telescope to start, which will cost around one billion euros for the first construction phase. The first stone of the telescope was ceremonially laid on 26 May 2017, initiating the construction of the dome's main structure and telescope, with first light being planned for 2025.\n\nOn 26 April 2010, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Council selected Cerro Armazones, Chile, as the baseline site for the planned ELT. Other sites that were under discussion included Cerro Macon, Salta, in Argentina; Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, on the Canary Islands; and sites in North Africa, Morocco, and Antarctica.\n\nEarly designs included a segmented primary mirror with a diameter of and an area of about , with a secondary mirror with a diameter of . However, in 2011 a proposal was put forward to reduce its size by 13% to 978 m, for a diameter primary mirror and a diameter secondary mirror. It reduced projected costs from 1.275 billion to 1.055 billion euros and should allow the telescope to be finished sooner. The smaller secondary is a particularly important change; places it within the capabilities of multiple manufacturers, and the lighter mirror unit avoids the need for high-strength materials in the secondary mirror support spider.\n\nESO's Director General commented in a 2011 press release that \"With the new E-ELT design we can still satisfy the bold science goals and also ensure that the construction can be completed in only 10–11 years.\" The ESO Council endorsed the revised baseline design in June 2011 and expected a construction proposal for approval in December 2011. Funding was subsequently included in the 2012 budget for initial work to begin in early 2012. The project received preliminary approval in June 2012. ESO approved the start of construction in December 2014, with over 90% funding of the nominal budget secured.\n\nThe design phase of the 5-mirror anastigmat was fully funded within the ESO budget. With the 2011 changes in the baseline design (such as a reduction in the size of the primary mirror from 42 m to 39.3 m), in 2017 the construction cost was estimated to be €1.15 billion (including first generation instruments). As of 2014, the start of operations was planned for 2024. Actual construction officially began in early 2017.\n\nESO focused on the current design after a feasibility study concluded the proposed diameter, Overwhelmingly Large Telescope, would cost €1.5 billion (£1 billion), and be too complex. Both current fabrication technology and road transportation constraints limit single mirrors to being roughly per piece. The next-largest telescopes currently in use are the Keck Telescopes, the Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Southern African Large Telescope, which each use small hexagonal mirrors fitted together to make a composite mirror slightly over across. The ELT uses a similar design, as well as techniques to work around atmospheric distortion of incoming light, known as adaptive optics.\n\nA 40-metre-class mirror will allow the study of the atmospheres of extrasolar planets. The ELT is the highest priority in the European planning activities for research infrastructures, such as the Astronet Science Vision and Infrastructure Roadmap and the ESFRI Roadmap. The telescope underwent a Phase B study in 2014 that included \"contracts with industry to design and manufacture prototypes of key elements like the primary mirror segments, the adaptive fourth mirror or the mechanical structure (...) [and] concept studies for eight instruments\".\n\nThe ELT will use a novel design with a total of five mirrors. The first three mirrors are curved (non-spherical), and form a three mirror anastigmat design for excellent image quality over the 10 arcminute field of view (one third of the width of the full Moon). The fourth and fifth mirrors are (almost) flat, and provide adaptive optics correction for atmospheric distortions (mirror 4), and tip-tilt correction for image stabilisation (mirror 5). The fourth and fifth mirrors also send the light sideways to one of the Nasmyth focal stations at either side of the telescope structure, allowing multiple large instruments to be simultaneously mounted.\n\nThe surface of the 39-metre primary mirror will be composed of 798 hexagonal segments, each measuring approximately 1.4 metres across and with 50 mm thickness. Each working day, two segments will be re-coated and replaced to ensure the mirror is always clean and highly reflective.\n\nEdge sensors constantly measure the relative positions of the primary mirror segments and their neighbours. 2394 position actuators (3 for each segment) use this information to support the system, keeping the overall surface shape unchanged against deformations caused by external factors such as wind, temperature changes or vibrations.\n\nIn January 2017, ESO awarded the contract for the fabrication of the 4608 edge sensors to the FAMES consortium, which is composed of Fogale and Micro-Epsilon. These sensors can measure relative positions to an accuracy of a few nanometres, the most accurate ever used in a telescope.\n\nIn May 2017, ESO awarded two additional contracts. One was awarded to Schott AG who will manufacture the blanks of the 798 segments, as well as an additional 133 segments as part of a maintenance set, allowing for the segments to be removed, replaced and cleaned on a rotating basis once the ELT is in operation. The mirror will be cast from the same low-expansion ceramic Zerodur as the existing Very Large Telescope mirrors in Chile.\n\nThe other contract was awarded to the French company, Safran Reosc, a subsidiary of Safran Electronics & Defense. They will receive the mirror blanks from Schott, and polish one mirror segment per day to meet the 7-year deadline. During this process, each segment will be polished until it has no surface irregularity greater than 7.5 nm RMS. Afterwards, Safran Reosc will then mount, test, and complete all optical testing before delivery. This is the second largest contract for the ELT construction and the third-largest contract ESO has ever signed.\n\nThe segment support system units for the primary mirror are designed and produced by CESA (Spain) and VDL (the Netherlands). The contracts signed with ESO also include the delivery of detailed and complete instructions and engineering drawings for their production. Additionally, they include the development of the procedures required to integrate the supports with the ELT glass segments; to handle and transport the segment assemblies; and to operate and maintain them.\n\nMaking the secondary mirror is a major challenge as it is highly convex, and aspheric. It is also very large; at 4.2 metres in diameter and weighing 3.5 tonnes, it will be the largest secondary mirror ever employed on a telescope and the largest convex mirror ever produced.\n\nIn January 2017, ESO awarded a contract for the mirror blank to Schott AG, who will manufacture it of Zerodur.\n\nComplex support cells are also necessary to ensure the flexible secondary and tertiary mirrors retain their correct shape and position; these support cells will be provided by SENER.\n\nThe pre-formed glass-ceramic blank of the secondary mirror will then be polished, and tested by Safran Reosc. The mirror will be shaped and polished to a precision of 15 nanometres (15 millionths of a millimetre) over the optical surface.\n\nThe 3.8-metre concave tertiary mirror, also cast from Zerodur, will be an unusual feature of the telescope. Most current large telescopes, including the VLT and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, use just two curved mirrors to form an image. In these cases, a small, flat tertiary mirror is sometimes introduced to divert the light to a convenient focus. However, in the ELT the tertiary mirror also has a curved surface, as the use of three mirrors delivers a better final image quality over a larger field of view than would be possible with a two-mirror design.\n\nThe 2.4-metre quaternary mirror is a flat adaptive mirror, and only 2 millimetres thick. With up to 8000 actuators, the surface can be readjusted at very high time frequencies. The deformable mirror will be the largest adaptive mirror ever made, and consists of six component petals, control systems, and voice-coil actuators. The image distortion caused by the turbulence of the Earth's atmosphere can be corrected in real time, as well as deformations caused by the wind upon the main telescope. The ELT's adaptive optics system will provide an improvement of about a factor of 500 in the resolution, compared to the best seeing conditions achieved so far without adaptive optics.\nThe AdOptica consortium, partnered with INAF (Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica) as subcontractors, are responsible for the design and manufacture of the quaternary mirror, which is to be shipped to Chile by the end of 2022. Safran Reosc will manufacture the mirror shells, and also polish them.\n\nThe ELT dome will have a height of nearly 74 metres from the ground and a diameter of 86 metres, making it the largest dome ever built for a telescope. The dome will have a total mass of around 5000 tonnes, and the telescope mounting and tube structure will have a total moving mass of more than 3000 tonnes.\n\nFor the observing slit, two main designs were under study: one with two sets of nested doors, and the current baseline design, i.e. a single pair of large sliding doors. This pair of doors has a total width of 45.3 m.\n\nESO signed a contract for its construction, together with the main structure of the telescopes, with the Italian ACe Consortium, consisting of Astaldi and Cimolai and the nominated subcontractor, Italy's EIE Group. The signature ceremony took place on 25 May 2016 at ESO's Headquarters in Garching bei München, Germany.\n\nThe dome is to provide needed protection to the telescope in inclement weather and during the day. A number of concepts for the dome were evaluated. The baseline concept for the 40m-class ELT dome is a nearly hemispherical dome, rotating atop a concrete pier, with curved laterally-opening doors. This is a re-optimisation from the previous design, aimed at reducing the costs, and it is being revalidated to be ready for construction.\n\nOne year after signing the contract, and after the laying of the first stone ceremony in May 2017, the site was handed over to ACe, signifying the beginning of the construction of the dome's main structure.\n\nIn terms of astronomical performance the dome is required to be able to track about the 1-degree zenithal avoidance locus as well as preset to a new target within 5 minutes. This requires the dome to be able to accelerate and move at angular speeds of 2 degrees/s (the linear speed is approximately 5 km/h).\n\nThe dome is designed to allow complete freedom to the telescope so that it can position itself whether it is opened or closed. It will also permit observations from the zenith down to 20 degrees from the horizon.\n\nWith such a large opening, the ELT dome requires the presence of a windscreen to protect the telescope's mirrors (apart from the secondary), from direct exposure to the wind. The baseline design of the windscreen minimises the volume required to house it. Two spherical blades, either side of the observing slit doors, slide in front of the telescope aperture to restrict the wind.\n\nThe dome design ensures that the dome provides sufficient ventilation for the telescope not to be limited by dome seeing. For this the dome is also equipped with louvers, whereby the windscreen is designed to allow them to fulfill their function.\n\nComputational fluid dynamic simulations and wind tunnel work are being carried out to study the airflow in and around the dome, as well as the effectiveness of the dome and windscreen in protecting the telescope.\n\nBesides being designed for water-tightness, air-tightness is also one of the requirements as it is critical to minimise the air-conditioning load. The air-conditioning of the dome is necessary not only to thermally prepare the telescope for the forthcoming night but also in order to keep the telescope optics clean.\n\nThe air-conditioning of the telescope during the day is critical and the current specifications permit the dome to cool the telescope and internal volume by 10 °C over 12 hours.\n\nThe ELT will search for extrasolar planets – planets orbiting other stars. This will include not only the discovery of planets down to Earth-like masses through indirect measurements of the wobbling motion of stars perturbed by the planets that orbit them, but also the direct imaging of larger planets and possibly even the characterisation of their atmospheres. The telescope will attempt to image Earthlike exoplanets, which may be possible.\n\nFurthermore, the ELT's suite of instruments will allow astronomers to probe the earliest stages of the formation of planetary systems and to detect water and organic molecules in protoplanetary discs around stars in the making. Thus, the ELT will answer fundamental questions regarding planet formation and evolution.\n\nBy probing the most distant objects the ELT will provide clues to understanding the formation of the first objects that formed: primordial stars, primordial galaxies and black holes and their relationships. Studies of extreme objects like black holes will benefit from the power of the ELT to gain more insight into time-dependent phenomena linked with the various processes at play around compact objects.\n\nThe ELT is designed to make detailed studies of the first galaxies and to follow their evolution through cosmic time. Observations of these early galaxies with the ELT will give clues that will help understand how these objects form and evolve. In addition, the ELT will be a unique tool for making an inventory of the changing content of the various elements in the Universe with time, and to understand star formation history in galaxies.\n\nOne of the goals of the ELT is the possibility of making a direct measurement of the acceleration of the Universe's expansion. Such a measurement would have a major impact on our understanding of the Universe. The ELT will also search for possible variations in the fundamental physical constants with time. An unambiguous detection of such variations would have far-reaching consequences for our comprehension of the general laws of physics.\n\nThe telescope will have several science instruments. It will be possible to switch from one instrument to another within minutes. The telescope and dome will also be able to change positions on the sky and start a new observation in a very short time.\n\nFrom the variety of instrument concepts studied, three instruments are under construction; MICADO, HARMONI and METIS, along with the adaptive optics system MAORY.\n\n\nAdditionally, two further instruments are currently being studied:\n\nOne of the largest optical telescopes operating today is the Gran Telescopio Canarias, with a 10.4 m aperture and a light-collecting area of 74 m. Other planned extremely large telescopes include the 25 m/368 m Giant Magellan Telescope and 30 m/655 m Thirty Meter Telescope, which are also targeting the beginning of the 2020 decade for completion. These other two telescopes roughly belong to the same next generation of optical ground-based telescopes. Each design is much larger than previous telescopes. Even with the reduction in size to 39.3 m, the ELT is significantly larger than both other planned extremely large telescopes. It has the aim of observing the Universe in greater detail than the Hubble Space Telescope by taking images 15 times sharper, although it is designed to be complementary to space telescopes, which typically have very limited observing time available. The ELT's 4.2-metre secondary mirror is the same size as the primary mirror on the William Herschel Telescope, the second largest optical telescope in Europe.\n\nThe ELT under ideal conditions has an angular resolution of 0.005 arcsecond which corresponds to separating two light sources 1 AU apart from 200 pc distance. At 0.03 arcseconds, the contrast is expected to be 10, sufficient to search for exoplanets. The unaided human eye has an angular resolution of 1 arcminute which corresponds to separating two light sources 30 cm apart from 1 km distance.\n\nThe images below show artistic renderings of the ELT and were produced by ESO.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1935748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935748", "title": "Life of Agony", "text": "Life of Agony\n\nLife of Agony is an American alternative metal band from Brooklyn, New York that was formed in 1989 by singer Mina Caputo, bassist Alan Robert and guitarist Joey Z. To date the band has released six studio albums.\n\nThe band was formed in the summer of 1989 by singer Mina Caputo, bassist Alan Robert and guitarist Joey Z. After playing with several drummers, they enlisted Type O Negative drummer Sal Abruscato before recording the debut album \"River Runs Red\" (1993) after they signed to Roadrunner Records.\n\n\"River Runs Red\" was followed by the more emotional \"Ugly\" (1995), but drummer Abruscato left Life of Agony after the accompanying tour. His successor was ex-Pro-Pain & ex-Crumbsuckers drummer Dan Richardson.\n\nVocalist Mina Caputo departed the band following the release of \"Soul Searching Sun\" (1997). She claimed her heart was no longer in the type of music Life of Agony produced. The band then toured with ex-Ugly Kid Joe singer Whitfield Crane, went back into the studio, and kicked Whitfield Crane out of the band. They contemplated moving Alan Robert to vocals and guitar and adding former Stuck Mojo bassist Corey Lowery, but decided they did not want to continue under the Life of Agony banner without Caputo. In 1999 they decided to split. Alan Robert started Among Thieves with former members of Biohazard and the rest of the band starting Stereomud with Erik Rogers on vocals, both not straying from LOA's style. A live CD with LOA's unplugged performance at the Dutch Lowlands Festival from 1997 was released in 2000.\n\nOn January 3 and 4, 2003, the original line-up reunited for two sold-out shows at New York's Irving Plaza. Both shows were recorded, and released on CD/DVD later that same year. The reunion resulted in several more shows and appearances on European festivals, as well as the recording of 2005's \"Broken Valley\", the band's first new studio album since 1997 and their first on the Sony-owned Epic Records. The album was a commercial disappointment for Epic, and they parted ways with the band at the end of 2005. Caputo later stated \"That experience killed this band in a lot of ways. The label didn't understand who this band was and continually tried to mould us into something we weren't. Not to mention the illegal spyware they put on our album without our knowledge to try and prevent piracy, and the class-action lawsuit they lost because of it. The court forced them to pull all of our records off the shelf just three months after it was released! The whole thing was a nightmare. We didn't want to make new music for a long time after that.\"\n\nLife of Agony went on to tour with Megadeth, Dream Theater, and numerous other metal bands during 2005's Gigantour. Three years after their tour in 2005, Life of Agony released a CD/DVD set for \"River Runs Red\" with bonus tracks and videos from their early career. Caputo was featured on the 2007 track \"What Have You Done\", from the band Within Temptation. The song has been a minor hit all around the world.\n\nDuring a December 2010 appearance on MTV's Headbangers Ball, Life of Agony announced they were writing new material. Sal stated in the interview that they were going to start with one song and see if there is a good enough spark to continue writing. This is something special for the fans for their patience.\nBy the summer of 2011 the band attempted to write new material only to feel it was being forced and not natural. Caputo stated that the band in an attempt not to become a novelty act was to go back into hiatus or permanently disband. Sal created A Pale Horse Named Death, Joey is still running his New York-based Method of Groove Studio, Alan is working on his second comic for IDW and a film of his first comic Wire hangers, and Mina will release three to four projects in the next year.\n\nIn a February 2012 interview, Sal Abruscato confirmed that Life of Agony was no more. He explains, \"We're not gonna play [anymore]. We moved out of our studio. We all kind of feel like we're at the end. We're never gonna make another record, because of those kinds of problems I was talking about [earlier in the interview] – we can't agree on writing a song. And Mina Caputo (vocals) wants to pursue her lifestyle. And that's pretty much the reason why also I've moved on and I'm doing my own thing... to just keep going; I didn't want my career to stop with Life of Agony. Life of Agony doesn't tour, Life of Agony doesn't do much. And so we were at a point where it was like... We did the last three shows in July [2011] and then we moved out of our studio, and that's it. I don't foresee anything in the future; I highly doubt it. I don't know how that would happen.\"\nIn a July 2012 interview with Revolver Magazine, Alan Robert described his attitude towards the state of the band. \"I actually don’t think Mina’s transition is the ultimate reason the band isn’t active right now. We’d been doing a lot less touring over the last bunch of years, way before she announced her personal news. I can only speak for myself, but I can say that starting a family has definitely made me want to tour and travel a lot less in general. For that reason in particular, I’m much happier being home working on my comics and film projects. It fulfills my creative needs and allows me to live the life I want to at this stage.\"\n\nOn March 22, 2014, Life of Agony confirmed on their official website that they were active again, and performed their first show since Caputo's gender confirmation at the Alcatraz Hard Rock & Metal Festival in Kortrijk, Belgium on August 8. They played Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey on September 13, 2014.\n\nOn January 12, 2016, Life of Agony announced that they were signed to Napalm Records, and released \"A Place Where There's No More Pain\", their first studio album in 12 years, on April 28, 2017.\n\nThe band announced the release, in October 2019, of its sixth studio album \"The Sound of Scars\" on Napalm Records, which acts as \"Chapter Two\" to their classic debut \"River Runs Red\". The concept album, hailed by Loudwire as one the year's \"Most Anticipated Hard Rock & Metal Albums\" was produced & mixed by Grammy Award-winning producer Sylvia Massy (Tool, System Of a Down, Johnny Cash) and co-produced by LOA's very own Joey Z. World renowned engineer Howie Weinberg (Metallica, Nirvana) handled mastering duties.\n\nOn August 9, 2019 the hit single 'Scars' premiered on Billboard the song shot to the #1 spot on Music Choice with 2.44 Million listeners.\n\nAccording to the group members themselves, they were influenced by bands as diverse as Radiohead, Metallica, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Social Distortion.\nRobert wrote the majority of the music and lyrics and Caputo wrote select ballads, mostly about her parents and homelife, particularly her mother. \n\nPerhaps the most striking difference between the \"River Runs Red\" and \"Ugly\" albums of the mid-90s and 2005's \"Broken Valley\" is the change in Caputo's vocal style, which gradually changed from a Danzig-esque baritone to a lighter, more conventional rock style later in the band's career.\n\nThe band continues to perform and make music together as well as pursuing individual projects. Caputo recorded several solo records with European musicians and has toured overseas to support those albums. The band is currently putting the finishing touches on a new DVD from their 2007 European tour.\n\nRobert, Life of Agony's primary songwriter, started Spoiler NYC in 2006. The group recorded an album called Grease Fire in Hell's Kitchen and filmed videos for singles \"Suicide Hotel\" and \"Ruined.\" Many reviewers praised the old-school approach to their street punk sound. He later established himself as a prolific horror comics author and illustrator, releasing several critically acclaimed series for award-winning publisher IDW Publishing. His creator-owned titles include, Wire Hangers, Crawl to Me (now in development to become a feature film), and Killogy (starring Frank Vincent of Goodfellas and The Sopranos, Marky Ramone of The Ramones, and Brea Grant of Heroes and Dexter).\n\nMember Joey Z. had created his own recording studio, Method of Groove, in Brooklyn, NY.\n\n\"River Runs Red\" was used in \"Initiation\", a 2006 episode of \"The Office\".\n\nWhile touring in 1995 in support of their album, \"Ugly\", a fan died after falling from the stage while apparently trying to stage-dive. A security guard and, to a lesser extent, the band were implicated in a lawsuit which was eventually dropped with no charges filed. At subsequent concerts the band were mindful of the potential for fans to injure themselves, often trying to cool down the mosh pit between songs if things were rough.

It is the second part of Turtledove's Southern Victory series of novels. It takes the Southern Victory Series from 1914 to 1915.\n\nAfter a prologue with Robert E. Lee smashing the Army of the Potomac at the Battle of Camp Hill, Pennsylvania due to him not losing Special Order 191, in October 1862, and the subsequent Anglo-French diplomatic recognition of the Confederate States of America. The embittered Abraham Lincoln tells British Ambassador Richard Lyons that the United States would eventually get even by finding a European ally to match both the United Kingdom and France; the Ambassador laughs scornfully, but Lincoln's prophecy comes true when by 1914 the US would be the firm ally of Imperial Germany.\n\nIn the larger Southern Victory Series context, the CSA and the USA remained hostile powers toward one another during the decades between 1862 and 1914. A second military defeat of the USA by the CSA in the Second Mexican War (1881-1882) greatly intensified the resentment and hatred of the Confederate States in the USA, where Remembrance Day becomes a grim official holiday marking the 1882 surrender and keeping alive the dream of revenge for the two humiliations inflicted by the South.\n\nThe novel's main plot begins on June 28, 1914, the same day Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg of Austria-Hungary, are assassinated in Sarajevo by Nedeljko Čabrinović with a bomb thrown into their car and explodes (as opposed to Gavrilo Princip with a gun in our timeline), with the incident drawing the European powers into a whirlwind of war. At the eruption of an alternate World War I known as the Great War, the USA and CSA find themselves on opposite sides of the divide between the Central Powers and the Entente Powers, respectively. The fighting in Europe quickly spreads to North America, where the pro-German United States under President Theodore Roosevelt and 75-year-old General George Armstrong Custer declare war on President Woodrow Wilson's CSA, which are allied with the United Kingdom, France, and Russia. After the Confederate seizure of Washington D.C. and invasion into Pennsylvania, and initial US invasions of Kentucky, Canada, and western Virginia, the conflict bogs down into trench warfare.\n\nBy the end of novel, in the autumn of 1915, the Confederates have been slowly driven out of Pennsylvania and back into Maryland, while poison gas assists the U.S. Army's slow advance through Kentucky. Across the Mississippi River, in the western part of the continent, the conflict is a war of movement, with the U.S. pushing deep into Sequoyah (our world's Oklahoma) and Confederate-owned Sonora. In the wider world the war has gone much the same as in actual history but the U.S has successfully conquered the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) from Britain, and Argentina has joined the Entente and is fighting Central-allied Chile.\n\nIn Canada, British and Canadian forces are slowly driven back to Guelph, Ontario and U.S. soldiers successfully establish a foothold on the north bank of the St Lawrence river. Winnipeg remains in Canadian hands, enabling Canada to remain in the war.\n\nThe novel ends with the beginning of a Marxist rebellion of African-Americans against the war-distracted government of the CSA.\n\nMost of the characters in the book are everyday people caught up in the bigger world of a global war. One main character in the book who goes on to play a major role in the series is a Confederate artillery sergeant named Jake Featherston.\n\nThis book is followed by \"\", and then \"\".\n\nThe idea that in 1914 Theodore Roosevelt is President of the Union while Woodrow Wilson is President of the Confederacy also came up in MacKinlay Kantor's \"If the South Had Won the Civil War\", published in magazine form in 1960 and book form in 1961. In an introduction to a reprint of that volume, Turtledove said that idea was too good not to use in his own series (in Kantor's version, the USA and CSA are allies in both World Wars, fighting together against Germany and finally reuniting in 1961).\n\nThree decades earlier, the short fiction \"If Robert E. Lee Had NOT Won the Battle of Gettysburg\" by Winston Churchill, published in \"If It Had Happened Otherwise\" (1931), had used the same idea.\n\nSF Site gave the book a mixed review, stating that \"there are simply too many characters in too many different theatres of war and far too much jump-cutting between them\" but \"Despite my criticisms, in the end I came away from American Front with a deeper appreciation for the world I really live in\". Kirkus were also critical in their review, calling the book a \"A workmanlike yam whose connection to reality, insecure at the outset, grows more tenuous with every turning page\". Publishers Weekly were more praising in their review, calling it \"state-of-the-art alternate history, nothing less\" and giving the book a star review.\n"}

{"id": "1935780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935780", "title": "Birmingham Zoo", "text": "Birmingham Zoo\n\nThe Birmingham Zoo is a zoological park that opened in 1955 in Birmingham, Alabama (US). It is the largest zoo in Alabama. The zoo is home to almost 800 animals representing over 200 species, including many endangered species from six continents.\n\nThe zoo is managed by a private non-profit corporation. It is a member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), participating in AZA Species Survival Plans (SSP). It is located, along with the Birmingham Botanical Gardens, in Lane Park, a city-owned park near the western terminus of U.S. Highway 280 at U.S. Highway 31 on the southern slope of Red Mountain.\n\nThe origins of the Birmingham Zoo start with a small menagerie of exotic animals kept in a Southside firehouse. As the collection grew, it was moved first to Magnolia Park (now Brother Bryan Park) and then to Avondale Park. At the time, the collection consisted mainly of non-exotic animals, except for \"Miss Fancy,\" a lone elephant donated by the Birmingham Advertising Club which had purchased it as a promotional novelty from a struggling circus stranded in the city.\n\nAs the collection grew in size and scope, city leaders contacted the Olmsted Brothers landscape architecture firm, which had drawn up plans for a system of parks in Birmingham, for advice about housing a zoological collection. They were put in contact with the few municipal zoos existing in that period and plans began for providing a new permanent home for the growing attraction.\n\nBirmingham, under mayor A. O. Lane, had purchased land on the south of Red Mountain between 1889 and 1896. The former Red Mountain Cemetery, a pauper's cemetery was part of the parcel that was dedicated as a city park in 1934. The Works Progress Administration built a fish hatchery and a number of pavilions from the Hartselle sandstone quarried out of the mountain within the park's borders. The hatchery was fed by a natural spring and provided stock for recreational lakes in the region until the zoo took over the park.\n\nThe first source of post-World War II support for a new zoo came from the Birmingham Junior Chamber of Commerce. In 1946, Elton B. Stephens chaired a Jaycees committee to create a new zoo for the city of Birmingham. In 1949, then Birmingham mayor, James R. Morgan, a key supporter of the development, began an initiative to help in the planning and development of a city zoo.\n\nA zoo commission was also established, and it decided to build the zoo on of land on the southern foot of Red Mountain with a budget of $250,000. A much larger parcel of land that included the zoo parcel was incorporated into the city of Birmingham and was named Lane Park, home of the zoo as well as the neighboring botanical gardens.\n\nThe budget would be spent to build six exhibits with the opening of the zoo that included \"Monkey Island,\" an elephant house, bear moat, birdhouse, snake pit and seal pool. The funds were raised through private donations, charter memberships, and in-kind donations from a broad base of community and business supporters.\n\nThe zoo, once known as The Jimmy Morgan Zoo, opened its doors with Monkey Island as its first official exhibit on April 2, 1955. The Jimmy Morgan Zoo operated as a quasi-private venture until city of Birmingham decided to assume responsibility in November 1955. In 1960, Bob Truett, a zoologist at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago was hired as the first real zoo director. Truett petitioned the city and changed the name to the Birmingham Zoo. The city set an annual budget of $663,000 for its first year under city control.\n\nBy the early 1960s, the Alabama Zoological Society was created as a non-profit support group to raise funds to supplement the escalating operational necessities, since funding for the zoo was inadequate to maintain and operate it at acceptable professional standards. A series of master plans were developed but never came to fruition due to lack of funding throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The need for significant improvements became increasingly evident by the 1990s.\n\nTruett was instrumental in starting the Zoological Society, creating the master plan and beginning the implementation of the plan. He was zoo director for 30 years before retiring in 1991. During his tenure, the zoo went from a few exhibits centered around a monkey island to a full-fledged, fully accredited, world class zoo.\n\nThe numerous financial demands on the city taking precedence led to the zoo's loss of accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums in the late 1990s due to concern about aging facilities and uncertainty over continued funding.\n\nIn 1999, members of the Alabama Zoological Society worked with Birmingham mayor Richard Arrington Jr. and other political leaders to set up a public-private partnership to operate the zoo. Strong community leaders were recruited to serve as the first board of directors of a new organization, Birmingham Zoo, Inc. (BZI) The new organization established a transitional funding package with contributions from four government entities to support BZI during its first five years of operation.\n\nBZI undertook an intense 18-month effort to address the most pressing and immediate problems so that the zoo could become accredited by the AZA once again, ranking the zoo in the top 10% of animal holding facilities in the nation. The zoo also received 501 (c)(3) status from the IRS, and the first major capital campaign was launched in January 2001.\n\nWilliam R. Foster, DVM, joined the zoo as Chief Executive Officer in January 2004. Foster, a veterinarian and leading zoo management authority on the national scene, is the past president of the American Zoo and Aquarium Association and was president and executive director of the Louisville Zoo.\n\nSince privatization, the Birmingham Zoo has hosted traveling exhibits of bats, koalas, and black-footed penguins, added a permanent Komodo dragon exhibit and interactive lorikeet aviary, and regained AZA accreditation. The zoo completed the Junior League of Birmingham – Hugh Kaul Children's Zoo, a $15 million anchor exhibit dedicated to children and devoted to urban, rural, and wild animals and environs of Alabama in April 2005, its 50th anniversary of operation.\n\nIn 2004, the zoo's older western lowland gorilla, Babec, became the first gorilla to be implanted with a pacemaker due to advanced heart disease.\n\nIt draws more than 450,000 visitors annually and, in 2005, was named Alabama's top tourist destination by the state's Bureau of Tourism and Travel. In 2006, the Birmingham Zoo drew more than 470,000 visitors making it second on the list of top tourist attractions in Alabama.\n\nIn 2011, the zoo opened its new Trails of Africa exhibit with the goal of housing an all-male herd of African elephants and becoming a national leader in the care and breeding of elephants. It included Bulwagi of Disney's Animal Kingdom, Callee of the Pittsburgh Zoo, and Ajani of the Indianapolis Zoo. A fourth bull elephant named Tamani arrived from Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo in April 2012 to complete the herd. The Kiwanis Giraffe Encounter was opened to the public at that same time. Four months later, the two male African lions, Baron and Vulcan were sent to the Montgomery Zoo for a recommendation of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Species Survival Plan. In late October 2012, a southern white rhinoceros named Max arrived from the Brevard Zoo to take part in a breeding program with the zoo's two female southern white rhinos, Laptop and her daughter, Ajabu.\n\nIt opened a temporary exhibit with fifteen animatronic dinosaurs known as \"Dino Discovery\". They were on display from March 16 to September 2, 2013.\n\nIn March 2014, two female American black bear cubs were added to the zoo. They were sent from Big Sky, Montana. The zoo introduced an exhibit featuring these two black bears known as the \"Barbara Ingalls Shook Black Bear Trail\" a year later.\n\nIn late February 2015, Cenzoo, the western lowland gorilla was transferred to Riverbanks Zoo to breed with three female gorillas. The African elephant, Tamani was sent to Missouri's Kansas City Zoo to breed with six female elephants eight months later.\n\nIn March 2017, the zoo introduced a three-year-old male jaguar named Khan. He was sent from the Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens.\n\nThe African elephant, Ajani was sent to Wichita's Sedgwick County Zoo to breed with six female elephants in May 2018. A year later, Callee the African elephant was transferred to Omaha, Nebraska's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium to breed with its five female elephants. Bulwagi remained the zoo's only African elephant until two young male African elephants named Ingadze and Lutsandvo arrived from San Diego Zoo Safari Park.\n\n\n\nTrails of Africa\n\n\nIn 2007, the zoo announced a major expansion called Trails of Africa. Opened in 2011, this exhibit features bull African Elephants in a bachelor herd setting. The exhibit is revolutionary because it has never been done before in a U.S. zoo to house multiple males together and attempt to replicate these bull herds recently discovered in the wild. At this time, three elephants (Bulwagi, Gadze, and Lutie) reside in the new facility. Trails of Africa includes an interactive boma yard, safari cafe, waterhole exhibit, and many more small accessories. This exhibit makes the Birmingham Zoo a national leader in the care and breeding of elephants.\n\nAfter the completion of the main exhibit in early 2011, the 50-year-old pachyderm building was renovated to allow staff to provide a higher quality of care for the three Southern White Rhinos and one Nile Hippo that reside there. A new giraffe yard was added in April 2012 that allows the zoo's young herd of giraffe to continue to grow and allow visitors a closer look at the animals while on the new feeding platform.\n\n"}
