{"id": "1850473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850473", "title": "Jefferson salamander", "text": "Jefferson salamander\n\nThe Jefferson salamander (\"Ambystoma jeffersonianum\") is a mole salamander native to the northeastern United States, southern and central Ontario, and southwestern Quebec. It was named after Jefferson College in Pennsylvania.\n\nIt is typically dark gray, brown, or black on its dorsal surface, but a lighter shade on its anterior. Some individuals may also have silver or blue specks on their sides; the area around the vent is usually gray. These salamanders are slender, with a wide nose and distinctive long toes, and range in size from .\n\nLike other mole salamanders, the Jefferson salamander burrows; they have well-developed lungs suited for this purpose. Nocturnal by nature, they can be spotted by day during the mating season. Breeding occurs in early spring, after the snow in the area has melted.\n\nEggs are laid in small agglomerations attached to submerged twigs or other natural support at the pond's edge. Clutches can contain between 5 and 60 eggs, averaging about 30. The age at which they first breed, and the frequency with which they breed, are unknown; females are estimated to first breed at 22 months, and males at 34 months. Eggs develop rapidly, and may hatch within 15 days. Larvae stay in the pond from two to four months, during which time they grow to between 3 and 8 times their hatching size.\n\nA unique reproductive tactic for the Bluespotted-Jefferson Salamander Complex exists in nature. The Jefferson salamander is now known not to breed in the lab with the blue-spotted salamander, which was previously thought to produce 'hybrids', the silvery salamander and Tremblay's salamander, between this supposed mating of Jefferson salamander and Blue-spotted salamander. The silvery salamander and Tremblay's salamander are now known through genetic testing to be polyploid females (only 2% of males survive and they are sterile). These most often possess two of each chromosome from the Jefferson salamander and one of each chromosome from the blue-spotted salamander, resulting in an LJJ genotype (also called a Tremblay's salamander.) This genotype results when these polyploid females mate with a pure Jefferson salamander male, incorporating (often in warmer water conditions) the chromosome from the pure male Jefferson salamander into her egg, usually having an LJ diploid chromosome set or LJJ triploid chromosome set, to produce LJJ or LJJJ offspring, respectively. Often in cooler conditions, the LJ or LJJ female may mate with the Jefferson salamander male and only 'borrow' his spermatozoan to trigger genetic cloning of herself, not adding his chromosome (J) to her egg. The same polyploid reproductive strategy occurs for other mole salamander species. The presence of these polyploids makes it difficult to visually identify which species an individual may be, skewing population measures for both species.\n\nThe secretive adults tend to hide under stones or logs, or in leaf litter and other underbrush in deciduous forests during damp conditions. They are usually not found in conifer forests, likely due to the dryness and prickliness of some pine and spruce needles, which may injure amphibians with their thin skins. They are found burrowed underground for most of the year during dry or freezing conditions. They must get below the frost line (about 18 inches) in order to survive winter conditions in northern latitudes. They often burrow in rich sandy soils found in upland deciduous forests or sometimes in older-growth damp hemlock forests.\n\nBecause breeding sites are usually close to the over-wintering burrows, migration to their breeding area is quick, and usually occurs during or immediately after a heavy rainfall. The breeding sites they choose are fishless ponds and vernal pools, filled with spring snow meltwater in northern latitudes. Some breeding ponds may be hundreds of yards (meters) away from their forest home in fragmented landscapes.\n\nJefferson salamanders are one of the first amphibians to emerge in springtime at the northern edge of their range in southern Ontario where they are seen \"snowshoeing\" across the still frozen understory of the forest to reach partially melted breeding ponds. Males migrate first with females following shortly thereafter. These salamanders have small pores on their heads which exude a whitish liquid when they are handled, suggesting that they may leave a scent trail during migration, \"Ambystoma jeffersonianum\" is often found in the same habitat as the spotted salamander.\n\nThe larvae are carnivorous, typically consuming aquatic invertebrates. An insufficient food supply may result in cannibalistic behaviour. Adults are also carnivorous, eating a variety of small invertebrates.\n\nThe Jefferson salamander is a species of least concern globally, but its habitat is threatened in parts of its range. In Ontario, it has been classified as an endangered species since 11 June 2011, and throughout Canada it is a threatened species. The government of Ontario has designated the species as a specially protected amphibian, which provides protection to the species and its habitats.\n\nIt is also considered a state-threatened species in Illinois.\n\n"}

She was named for Lieutenant Albert David, a Medal of Honor recipient. Laid down on 28 April 1964 and commissioned on 19 October 1968, the Albert David served in the Pacific, including performing gunfire support operations in Vietnam during the 1970s. She was briefly deployed to the Arabian Sea in September and October 1982. On 18 September 1989 she was leased to the Brazilian Navy, and then sold to Brazil where she served as the destroyer \"Pará\" (D 27) until 12 November 2008 when she was decommissioned and put in reserve.\n\n\"Albert David\" was laid down on 28 April 1964 at Seattle, Washington, by the Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Co.; launched on 19 December 1964; sponsored by Mrs. Lynda Mae David; and commissioned at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 19 October 1968, Comdr. Roy Skofield Reynolds in command.\n\nFor the remainder of 1968, \"Albert David\" completed outfitting at Bremerton, Washington, and conducted post-commissioning trials and tests. Those examinations continued into 1969. A voyage to Hawaii followed in March. Early in April, the ocean escort began five weeks of refresher training out of San Diego. On 1 May 1969, she was assigned to Long Beach, California, as her home port. She concluded refresher training eight days later and arrived in Long Beach on 10 May. On 12 May, however, \"Albert David\" headed back to Bremerton for an eight-week, post-shakedown availability at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The warship returned to sea on 7 July, bound for the coast of southern California and several days of operations out of San Diego. She returned to Long Beach on the 18th.\n\n\"Albert David\" carried out normal operations from the base at Long Beach until the beginning of the second week in October. On 8 October, she stood out of Long Beach on her first deployment to the western Pacific. After steaming via Pearl Harbor and Midway Island, the warship arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 31 October. \"Albert David\" then served two weeks on the Taiwan Strait patrol and visited Subic Bay in the Philippines before reporting at Da Nang, South Vietnam, on 24 November to begin Vietnam War gunfire support duty. That assignment lasted until 10 December when, after a brief stop at Da Nang, the ocean escort headed for the Gulf of Tonkin. From ll to 18 December, she operated on the south air-sea rescue (ASR) station in the gulf. On 16 December, \"Albert David\" joined company with the aircraft carrier for two days of plane guard duty. The warship left station in the Gulf of Tonkin on 18 December and headed for Bangkok, Thailand, where her crew enjoyed a five-day port visit. On 30 December, she rendezvoused with the carrier and began five weeks of plane guard duty with the carriers of Task Force 77 (TF 77).\n\nEarly in February 1970, she left the Gulf of Tonkin to make port visits at Subic Bay and Hong Kong. On her way back to Vietnamese waters, \"Albert David\" visited Okinawa and, during that visit, put to sea to investigate a Soviet trawler loitering in the area. She returned to Vietnam at Danang on 27 February to resume gunfire support missions for the troops fighting ashore. At the beginning of the second week in March, the ocean escort left the gunline to rejoin the carriers of TF 77 in the Gulf of Tonkin. Eight days later, she pulled into Subic Bay to make preparations for the voyage back to the United States. On 21 March, \"Albert David\" stood out of Subic Bay on her way home.\n\nThe warship made stops at Guam, Midway, and Pearl Harbor before arriving in Long Beach on 9 April. Following post-deployment standdown, \"Albert David\" settled into the normal schedule of training operations carried out by warships between overseas deployments. Those evolutions occupied her time until the beginning of November when she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. Albert David's first regular overhaul lasted more than eight months.\n\nOn 1 July 1971, she put to sea for post-overhaul trials and drills, and she remained so occupied for the remainder of the month. August brought refresher training out of San Diego, and September saw her resume normal 1st Fleet operations out of Long Beach.\n\nOn 12 November 1971, \"Albert David\" departed Long Beach on her second deployment to the Far East. En route, she spent more than a week in the Hawaiian Islands before continuing on to the Philippines. The ocean escort arrived in Subic Bay on 9 December and remained there almost a week. On the 15th, she put to sea bound for the Gulf of Tonkin, arriving on station two days later. \"Albert David\" spent the following six weeks on gunfire support station off the coast of Vietnam. At the end of January 1972, she headed back to Subic Bay to rest, rearm, and reprovision. The warship returned to the combat zone this time in the Gulf of Siam off the shores of South Vietnam's IV Corps on 6 February and resumed duty as a seaborne heavy artillery battery supporting ground forces ashore.\n\n\"Albert David\" left the Gulf of Siam on 24 February bound for the Gulf of Tonkin. She rendezvoused with the aircraft carrier on 29 February and served as the carrier's escort for two days of operations in the Gulf of Tonkin as well as during the voyage to Subic Bay. After 10 days of upkeep and repairs at Subic Bay, the ocean escort departed the Philippines for Hong Kong on 14 March. The port visit at Hong Kong lasted from 16 to 22 March. On the latter day, the warship laid in a course that took her via Okinawa to the Sea of Japan. She conducted antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises between 26 and 29 March and made a port call at Yokosuka, Japan, from 30 March to 5 April.\n\nAfter a false start for home on the 5th and a return to Japan to reload necessary equipment, \"Albert David\" headed back to Vietnamese waters that same day. Reporting for gunfire support duty off the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North Vietnam and South Vietnam on 10 April she performed a variety of other tasks as well. On 11 and 12 April \"Albert David\" participated in action while encountering enemy hostile fire. The crew received the Combat Action Ribbon. After four days of gunfire support missions, the warship joined the cruiser for 10 days of escort duty on picket station. From 28 April to 12 May, she again provided gunfire support. \"Albert David\" concluded that tour of duty in the combat zone with four days of service with the landing platform dock on the notification line established to warn merchant ships about mines in North Vietnamese harbors.\n\nOn 17 May, the ocean escort set out for Subic Bay in company with \"Constellation\". The two warships visited Subic Bay from 19 to 22 May and then got underway for Singapore. After a four-day port call at Singapore, they returned to sea on 30 May on their way back to the waters surrounding Vietnam. \"Albert David\" parted company with \"Constellation\" on 2 June to render gunfire support to troops in I and II Corps in South Vietnam. At the end of 10 days on the gunline, she formed up with \"Constellation\" again on 12 June. The two warships stopped at Subic Bay on 15 June and returned to sea almost immediately. On 20 June, they arrived in Yokosuka for a two-day port call before beginning the voyage across the Pacific. \"Albert David\" and \"Constellation\" cleared Yokosuka on 22 June bound for the United States. \"Albert David\" escorted the carrier until 30 June when she received orders to proceed independently. The ocean escort entered Long Beach the following morning.\n\nFollowing a month-long post-deployment leave and upkeep period, the ocean escort began normal 1st Fleet operations on 3 August with plane guard services for the carrier in the southern California operating area. On 26 August, she put to sea from Long Beach to participate in Operation \"RimPac-72,\" conducted in the Hawaiian Islands with units of the navies of Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. \"Albert David\" returned to Long Beach from that exercise on 19 September and remained in port for three weeks. At that time, she resumed normal operations along the California coast.\n\nThe warship performed training duties out of Long Beach until near the end of the first week in January 1973. On the 5th, she stood out to sea on her way back to the Far East. Steaming in company with \"Constellation\", \"Albert David\" completed the transit of the Pacific at Subic Bay on 22 January. Four days later, she embarked upon the voyage to the Gulf of Tonkin, again escorting \"Constellation\". For the next three weeks, she provided plane guard services and antisubmarine protection for the carriers of TF 77 during what proved to be her last tour of duty in the gulf before the United States pulled out of the Vietnam War. \"Albert David\" returned to Subic Bay on 14 February and spent the next three weeks undergoing minor repairs and conducting training in the Philippines.\n\nOn 6 March, \"Albert David\" departed Iloilo on the island of Panay to return to Vietnamese waters. This time, however, her mission was a peaceful one. She was part of Operation End Sweep, the removal of mines from North Vietnamese waters. Her participation in that effort punctuated by port visits to Sasebo in Japan, Subic Bay in the Philippines, and Hong Kong lasted until the second week in June. The warship cleared Vietnamese waters on 9 June, visited Keelung on Taiwan on 12 and 13 June, and arrived in Yokosuka on the 17th. Two days later, the ocean escort returned to sea for the voyage back to the United States. She made brief stops for fuel at Midway Island and Pearl Harbor before reaching Long Beach on 3 July.\n\nPost-deployment standdown followed by a lengthy restricted availability at the Todd Shipyard in San Pedro occupied her time until late November. She returned to Long Beach on 21 November but remained there only long enough to make preparations to move to San Diego, the new home port to which she had been assigned on 20 August. \"Albert David\" made the home port shift on 1 December and commenced local operations out of San Diego six days later. The warship continued that employment through the end of 1973 and during the first four months of 1974. On 23 April 1974, she left San Diego in company with the destroyers and bound for the western Pacific. \"Albert David\" and her travelling companions made fuel stops at Pearl Harbor and Midway Island before arriving in Yokosuka on 14 May. On 25 May, the ocean escort put to sea in a task group built around the aircraft carrier to conduct operations off the island of Honshū. Thus she began her first period of service with the 7th Fleet in which combat duty off the Vietnamese coast played no role. The warship alternated between periods of training at sea and port calls at such places as Yokosuka, Hong Kong, Guam, and Subic Bay.\n\nWhen she returned to San Diego on 22 October 1974, \"Albert David\" embarked upon a period of almost 42 months without a deployment to the Far East. She spent most of the remainder of 1974 in port, initially engaged in post-deployment standdown and later in holiday routine. The ocean escort conducted a number of exercises in 1975. Late March and early April brought a voyage to Hawaii for Operation \"RIMPAC\" 1-75, a multinational exercise conducted in cooperation with the navies of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. In mid-April, she returned to the west coast and resumed local operations. On 30 June 1975, \"Albert David\" was reclassified a frigate and redesignated FF-1050. In September, she made another cruise to the Hawaiian Islands where she spent four weeks engaged in exercises before returning to San Diego early in November. Local operations again occupied her time, some of which involved serving as a test platform for a new Towed Array Sonar System (TASS) until the spring of 1976. Late in April 1976, the frigate sailed to Long Beach where she began an 11-month regular overhaul on 22 April. \"Albert David\" concluded her repairs at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on St. Patrick's Day 1977 and returned to San Diego nine days later. She operated on a normal training schedule out of her home port until the beginning of August when she voyaged to Hawaii again for training purposes. Returning to San Diego on 29 August, the frigate settled into a normal west coast training schedule once more.\n\nThe hiatus in Far Eastern deployments came to an end in the spring of 1978. \"Albert David\" stood out of San Diego on 4 April and set a course for Hawaii. En route there, she participated in \"RIMPAC\" 1-78. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, the frigate continued her voyage west on 25 April. She arrived in Subic Bay on 16 May. During the ensuing five months, \"Albert David\" conducted exercises with units of the 7th Fleet and participated in the binational Exercise \"Sharkhunt XXVII\" with elements of the Republic of China Navy. She also visited ports in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The frigate concluded that tour of duty in the Far East with a readiness exercise and a series of special operations. After a visit to Guam between 11 and 14 October, \"Albert David\" embarked upon the voyage back to the United States. She reentered San Diego on 29 October and, except for a two-day period underway locally, spent the remainder of 1978 in port.\n\nTwelve days into 1979, the warship began the usual schedule of training operations, trials and inspections. That employment occupied her time through the first 10 months of the year. On 13 November 1979, she left San Diego to return to the western Pacific. \"Albert David\" made a very brief stop at Pearl Harbor on 21 November resuming her voyage west that same day. She arrived at Subic Bay on 9 December and spent the remainder of the year in port.\n\nThe frigate operated locally out of Luzon ports until the second week in February 1980 when she embarked upon a voyage to Singapore in company with the cruisers \"Long Beach\", , and the frigate . A main engine casualty, however, forced her return to Subic Bay under tow of Long Beach and, later, of . She remained in Subic Bay from 12 February through the end of the month. The warship returned to sea on 1 March for two weeks of exercises followed by a port visit at Buckner Bay, Okinawa.\n\nAfter an antisubmarine warfare exercise and another stop at Buckner Bay, \"Albert David\" set a course for Pusan, Korea, on 23 March. The warship spent the last week of the month indulging in liberty at Pusan. From there, she moved on to Sasebo, Japan, for a repair and upkeep period preparatory to her return to the United States. On 9 April 1980, the frigate departed Sasebo and embarked upon the voyage home by way of Guam, Kwajalein, and Pearl Harbor. She reentered San Diego on 2 May. Post deployment standdown occupied the remainder of May while June and July brought a resumption of local operations. Early in August, she visited Alaskan waters before beginning regular overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at mid-month.\n\nThose repairs occupied the frigate for the rest of 1980 and for the first nine months of 1981. Early in October 1981, \"Albert David\" resumed local operations out of San Diego. That duty kept her busy until near the end of May 1982. On 29 May, she got underway for the western Pacific via Pearl Harbor. The frigate arrived in Subic Bay on 2 July. After almost three weeks at that base in the Philippines, \"Albert David\" moved north to Sasebo, Japan, where she stayed from 26 July until 12 August. The warship arrived back in Subic Bay on 17 August but set sail again four days later on the 21st in company with the destroyer and stores ship bound for the Arabian Sea and a tour of duty with the Middle East Force. She performed surveillance chores in the Arabian Sea from 7 September to 18 October. On 19 October, \"Albert David\" started out on the long voyage back to the United States. She entered San Diego on 30 November and spent the remainder of 1982 engaged in post-deployment leave and upkeep.\n\nStanddown carried over well into the third week of 1983. On 20 January, \"Albert David\" took up local operations out of San Diego with a three-day readiness exercise. A variety of training evolutions conducted in the waters off the coast of southern California occupied her time during the nine months between January and October 1983. On 4 October, however, the frigate stood out to sea on her way to the Far East once more. She made a five-day stop at Pearl Harbor and conducted a battle problem in the Mariana Islands before steaming into Subic Bay at the beginning of the second week in November. At mid-month, \"Albert David\" put to sea again to participate in a series of bilateral exercises with units of the Royal Malaysian Navy, the Royal Singapore Navy, and the Navy of the Republic of Korea. Interspersed among those exercises were goodwill and liberty calls at Lumut in Malaysia, Singapore, Chinhae in Korea, and at Hong Kong. On 28 December, she returned to the Philippines at Manila where she ushered in the new year.\n\n\"Albert David\"s western Pacific deployment continued until early April 1984. January brought a visit to Cebu City in the Philippines, a brief return to Subic Bay, and another bilateral exercise, this time with the Royal Thai Navy. Exercises with other units of the 7th Fleet followed. At the end of January, the frigate sailed north to Japan for upkeep and repairs at Yokosuka. At the beginning of the last week in February, the warship completed repairs and put to sea to conduct antisubmarine warfare exercises with elements of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. The end of February and beginning of March brought visits to Sasebo and Fukuoka in Japan. During mid-March, she operated with South Korean Navy units again and then made port visits at Chinhae and Pusan, Korea, and at Sasebo, Japan. \"Albert David\" departed Sasebo on 3 April on her way back to the United States. En route, she lingered in the Marianas to participate in another battle problem and stopped at Pearl Harbor on 21 and 22 April. The warship pulled into San Diego on 30 April. Post-deployment standdown took up the month of May, and operations along the California coast occupied the summer and early fall of 1984. At the beginning of November, \"Albert David\" began restricted availability at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard.\n\nThat repair period carried her into 1985. Back in San Diego by 5 January, she resumed local operations by the end of the month. The frigate settled into a schedule of training exercises along the west coast, highlighted by port visits to Canadian and United States cities, that kept her busy throughout 1985 and nearly through 1986. On 29 September 1986, \"Albert David\" entered the yard of the National Steel & Shipbuilding Co. at San Diego to begin regular overhaul. Upon completion the ship participated in numerous ASW and detailed testing platform operations in the North Pacific and mid Pacific Islands as a member of DESRON 31 until on 18 September 1989 she was decommissioned.\n\n\"Albert David\" earned three battle stars for service in the Vietnam War.\n\nThe Brazilian Navy leased the ship from its date of decommissioning from the USN on 18 September 1989, renaming the ship as the destroyer Pará (D 27). Brazil later purchased the vessel outright on 24 January 2001 and it was struck from the US' Naval Vessel Register that same date. It served with Brazil until 12 November 2008 when she was decommissioned, and currently sits in reserve.\n\n"}

University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979), was a United States Supreme Court case which interpreted Congressional silence in the face of earlier interpretations of similar laws to determine that Title IX of the Higher Education Act provides an implied cause of action.\n\nPlaintiff Geraldine Cannon sued the University of Chicago, asserting that she was denied admission on the basis of her sex, and that she had a cause of action under Title IX, which bars sex discrimination by federally funded institutions, but does not expressly grant a private right of action. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois dismissed the case. The dismissal was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which held that the statutory procedure for termination of federal funds was the exclusive remedy provided by Congress.\n\nOne issue, buried in footnotes, would be of importance in the subsequent \"Alexander v. Sandoval\" decision. The University of Chicago claimed that Cannon was denied admission because the medical university admissions departments had a policy of not admitting applicants over thirty years of age, at least not without an advanced degree. Northwestern Medical School absolutely disqualified applicants over 35. Cannon was 39 years old at the time. The policy had a disparate impact on women.\n\nThe plaintiff appealed, contending that Congress acted in light of similar language in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which the Supreme Court had already found to imply a private remedy, and to which Congress had allowed attorney fees (which would be unnecessary absent a private right of action).\n\nDid Congress intend a private remedy to be implied from the Title IX? Are individuals allowed to sue under Title IX, or are they only allowed to participate in class-action suits by the HEW?\n\nThe Court, in an opinion by Justice Stevens, applied the four-part test set forth in \"Cort v. Ash\", 422 U.S. 66 (1975), used in order to determine whether Congress had meant for a law to be able to be privately enforced:\nThe court determined that all of the \"Cort\" factors pointed to an implied right of action:\nThe Court also recognized that while this new source of financial liability might affect universities badly, it was up to Congress to weigh that concern.\n\nA dissenting opinion by Justice Powell raised separation of powers concerns. He called the Court's decision legislation, noting that Congress knew how to make judicial remedies, and saying that three of the four factors invited judicial lawmaking—only the second factor, he argued, was really about congressional intent. Powell contended that the Court's decision would encourage Congress to be lax in their duty to create laws, expecting democratically unaccountable judges to do the job for them.\n\n"}

Margarida was of lower nobility and Roberto's Grandfather, William Ivens, was a merchant awarded the Ivens Arms by George III in 1816. Robert Breakspeare Ivens was a great-grandson of Thomas Hickling (Boston 1745-1836 Ponta Delgada) the American vice-consul in Ponta Delgada.\n\nIn 1861, Ivens attended the Navy School in Lisbon. At school Roberto was known as \"Roberto of the Devil\" and he became known as an intelligent young gentleman. He joined the Portuguese Navy in 1870 at the age of 20 and attended Escola Prática de Artilharia Naval in 1871. Ivens left for the Suez Canal in September of the same year, where he was the garrison of the \"Estefânia\".\n\nIvens began his travels in Angola in 1872. On October 10, 1874, he completed three years of travels in the colonies. Returning to Portugal in January 1875, Ivens made examination for lieutenant. In April 1875, he sailed on the \"Duque de Terceira\" for Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe and various ports of South America.\n\nIn 1876, Ivens set out for the United States, bringing Portuguese products to Philadelphia for the Centennial Exposition. His ancestor, Thomas Hickling, had been an ardent American revolutionary, and had in fact left Boston for the Azores following an argument with his loyalist father.\n\nIvens went on an expedition into the provinces of Angola and Mozambique beginning on May 11, 1877 and studied relations between hydrographic basins in Zambezi. His hydrographic studies are considered even today to be \"amazingly perfect\". In the same year he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant.\n\nIvens went on an expedition on June 21, 1885 at Quelimane in Mozambique. Ivens, as requested by the King Luís I, and in the aftermath of the Berlin Conference, to travel between Angola and Mozambique, which ended in over 4,500 miles (about 8,300 km) of which 1/3 was uncharted in what was called \"Contracosta\".\n\nFor his service to Portugal, Roberto had the honor of being named aide-de-camp to King Luís. In 1895, he was made Officer of Military Order of Aviz and was nominated on October 17 as secretary of the Commission of Cartography.\n\nPortugal has ten streets named after Roberto Ivens including one in Ponta Delgada named \"Avenida Roberto Ivens\". Several schools are named in his honor, including Escola Básica Integrada Roberto Ivens, near his birthplace.\n\nA species of African lizard, \"Lubuya ivensii\", is named in his honor.\nHe was also portrayed in the 500 Angolan escudo banknote issued in 1956.\n\n\n\n"}

It crosses the Rideau Canal linking the Glebe and Centretown to Old Ottawa East. The bridge was built in 1915, replacing an earlier wooden swing bridge on Argyle Street just to the north. It is a vertical-lift bridge, meaning that the central portion of the bridge can be elevated to allow boats to pass underneath. Although built by the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company, the lift span is not a bascule type but a lift-type.\n\nIn the late 1970s it was discovered that road salt had seriously damaged the bridge. Proposals were advanced to build a larger and higher bridge, but these were opposed by those who saw the bridge as a heritage structure. Eventually it was decided to rebuild the bridge almost exactly as it had been before.\n\nThe bridge shares its name with nearby Pretoria Avenue. Pretoria Avenue, formerly Jane Street, was renamed in 1902 to commemorate the British victory in the Second Boer War and those Canadians that had served. The name comes from the captured Boer capital, Pretoria. The name later become controversial as most Canadians associated it with the apartheid regime in South Africa. In the late 1980s a movement was launched to rename the bridge after Nelson Mandela. This was opposed by others who felt it was an important monument to Canadians who had fought in South Africa.

The band had a cult following throughout the 1980s and reformed in 2013.\n\nThe band was formed in Wandsworth, South London in 1977, by sisters Jody Turner (vocals and guitar) and Julie Turner (drums) when they were thirteen and nine years old respectively. They recruited high school friend Tracey Lamb on bass guitar and that completed their first line-up. Later Donnica Colman joined, adding a second guitar, and after her departure, Jackie Apperley replaced her, also on second guitar. After Apperley left, the band rehearsed intensively as a trio, and placed a track on a sampler album, which circulated in the London music underground. Meanwhile, their manager John Turner, Jody and Julie's father, who owned a music store and rehearsal rooms, used his musical connections to get the band their first gigs. Finally, after an appearance at the Reading Festival in 1982, the band obtained a recording contract with A&M.\n\nThey released their eponymous debut studio album with record producer Vic Maile in February 1983, and at that time there were temporary legal problems – Julie Turner was still a minor attending high school and she was restricted in the number of live shows that she could participate in. Also during this period, Kat Burbella briefly joined the band as a second guitarist, and Tracey Lamb became disgruntled and quit the band, initially forming the band She with Burbella, but then joining Girlschool in 1987. She was replaced by Dee O'Malley, who played the bass guitar and keyboards on the band's second studio album, \"Hell Hath No Fury\", which was produced by Chris Tsangarides and released in October 1983. The band co-headlined with Y&T, supported Iron Maiden and Def Leppard on UK and European tours, and embarked on their own headlining tours. O'Malley announced her pregnancy just before Rock Goddess' first US tour and left the band. Rock Goddess left A&M with their third album unfinished and unreleased. O'Malley was replaced by Julia Longman on bass guitar, and Becky Axten on keyboards.\n\nIn 1987, their third studio album was released exclusively in France, with the title \"Young and Free\", however, due to insurmountable problems Rock Goddess disbanded shortly thereafter. In 1988, the Turner sisters reappeared as the Jody Turner Band with two male musicians, but they did not go beyond the local club circuit. Jody Turner fronted a new line-up of Rock Goddess in 1994. After a name change to Braindance, the band disbanded again in 1995. They played their last gig at the pub Thomas O'Becket.\n\nThe band reformed in 2009 to play the Hard Rock Hell music festival in Prestatyn, Wales, but were forced to split before they had a chance to perform.\n\nIn March 2013 it was announced that the original line-up of Jody Turner, Julie Turner, and Tracey Lamb had reformed and would start recording a new album. The three of them began the process of recording a new album tentatively titled \"Unfinished Business\".\n\nThe album failed to appear, but in 2017 a 3-track EP was announced. \"It's More Than Rock and Roll\" was released on 19 May 2017, and a video for the title track was released via Vintage TV on 21 April that year.\n\nOn 10 July 2018 it was announced that bassist Tracey Lamb had left the band. She later rejoined Girlschool in 2019 as a temporary touring member initially and later as the successor for long-time bassist Enid Williams. Jenny Lane was announced as the new bassist on 9 October 2018.

His grandfather was Lieut Col George Addison, who played for the Royal Engineers in the 1872 and 1874 FA Cup Finals.\n\nAt the age of sixteen he entered the Royal College of Music, where he studied composition with Gordon Jacob, oboe with Léon Goossens, and clarinet with Frederick Thurston. This education ended in 1939 with service in World War II. Addison served with the British XXX Corps in the 23rd Hussars. He was a tank officer in the Battle of Normandy and wounded at Caen, later participating in Operation Market Garden. Addison would later write the score for the film \"A Bridge Too Far\" about the operation. At the end of the war, he returned to London to teach composition at the Royal College of Music.\n\nAddison is best known for his film scores. He won an Academy Award for Best Original Score and a Grammy Award in the Best Original Score from a Motion Picture or Television Show category for the music to the 1963 film, \"Tom Jones\". He also won a BAFTA Award for \"A Bridge Too Far\" (1977). His other film scores included \"A Taste of Honey\" (1961), \"Smashing Time\" (1967), \"The Honey Pot\" (1967), \"Sleuth\" (1972), \"Swashbuckler\" (1976) and the television series \"Centennial\" (1978).\n\nHe composed the theme music for the television series \"Murder, She Wrote\", for which he won an Emmy. Addison will also be remembered as the composer Alfred Hitchcock turned to when the director ended his long relationship with Bernard Herrmann over the score to his 1966 film \"Torn Curtain\".\n\nHe had a personal connection to \"Reach for the Sky\" (1956) which he scored, since Douglas Bader (the subject of the movie) was his brother-in-law.\n\nFor the theatre, Addison wrote the music for John Osborne's plays \"The Entertainer\" (1957) and \"Luther\" (1961). He collaborated with John Cranko on a revue, \"Cranks\" in 1956.\n\nAlthough he wrote numerous classical compositions, Addison explained that \"If you find you're good at something, as I was as a film composer, it's stupid to do anything else.\" His classical works included the Concerto for trumpet, strings and percussion (1949), described by \"The Times\" as \"buoyant\" and \"Gershwinesque\"; a trio for oboe, clarinet and bassoon; \"Carte Blanche\", a ballet for Sadler's Wells from which an orchestral suite of \"sophisticated high spirits\" was performed at the Proms; a septet for wind and harp, a piano concerto, a concertante for oboe, clarinet, horn and orchestra; and a partita for strings, which was warmly praised.\n\nMarlene Dietrich recorded \"If He Swing By the String\" and \"Such Trying Times\" from the music in \"Tom Jones\".\n\nAddison's collection of correspondence, scores, and studio recordings were donated to the Film Music Archives at Brigham Young University in 1994.

{"id": "1850548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850548", "title": "The Empty Child", "text": "The Empty Child\n\n\"The Empty Child\" is the ninth episode of the first series of the British science fiction television programme \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast on BBC One on 21 May 2005. It was the first episode written by Steven Moffat, who later became the showrunner and main writer of the series in 2010 following Russell T Davies' departure, and was directed by James Hawes. \"The Empty Child\" is the first of a two-part story, which concluded with \"The Doctor Dances\", on 28 May.\n\nIn the episode, the alien time traveller the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his travelling companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) arrive in 1941 during the London Blitz, where they find that the city has been terrorised by a strange child in a gas mask repeatedly asking for his mother.\n\nThe episode marks the first appearance of John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness, who would become a recurring character in \"Doctor Who\" and the lead character of the spin-off series \"Torchwood\". \"The Empty Child\" was watched by 7.11 million viewers in the UK. The two-part story has been cited by critics amongst the best of the show, and it won the 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.\n\nThe Ninth Doctor and Rose follow a time-travelling metal cylinder to London during the Blitz of World War II. Landing about a month after the cylinder, the Doctor tries to track it, while Rose discovers a young boy wearing a gas mask on a nearby roof. Rose climbs on a nearby rope, but she realises too late that the rope is the tethering cable of a barrage balloon, and is carried off the ground. Captain Jack Harkness, a former time agent from the future posing as a Royal Air Force officer, rescues Rose with his camouflaged spaceship before Rose falls from the balloon. Jack mistakes Rose for a potential customer of an object that he is willing to sell. Rose plays along, but insists she needs to discuss the matter with her partner before buying.\n\nMeanwhile, the Doctor returns to the TARDIS to find its phone ringing; despite caution from Nancy, a young woman nearby, not to answer it, he does, only to hear the voice of a child asking \"Are you my mummy?\" He follows Nancy to a house left empty from the recent air raid sirens, where Nancy and some orphaned children eat a meal abandoned by the homeowners. The Doctor tries to learn more from Nancy, but the boy in the gas mask knocks at the door. Nancy orders the children to leave by the back entrance, and warns the Doctor not to touch the boy. The Doctor opens the door anyway, but the child is gone. The Doctor catches up to Nancy and convinces her to give him more information. Nancy reveals that she knew the cylinder fell near a nearby hospital, and its appearance is tied to the boy.\n\nThe Doctor arrives at the hospital and discovers several patients wearing gas masks fused to their bodies. Dr Constantine explains that Jamie, Nancy's brother, was the first patient with this symptom. Suddenly, Constantine changes into another gas mask-wearing person, and the other patients all rise to start chasing the Doctor. Rose and Jack arrive and quickly escape with the Doctor. The Doctor forces Jack to admit that the crashed cylinder is just a Chula medical ship. The three are trapped in a room as the converted patients converge on them, all asking \"Are you my mummy?\" Nancy, who had returned to the home to get more food, is also cornered by Jamie, the boy, as he reaches out to her.\n\nThis episode had the working title \"World War II\". Early versions of this script quoted this episode's title as being \"An Empty Child\". This is a reference to \"An Unearthly Child\", the very first episode of \"Doctor Who\". The episode's television listings information and the DVD cover also mention that \"London is being terrorised by an unearthly child\". In Davies's initial pitch, Captain Jack was originally called 'Captain Jax', an interstellar alien soldier. The name Jax was eventually dropped, as was Jack's original characterization, instead being a human conman from the 51st century.\n\nThe filming took place during the fourth production block. Special effects shots were completed at Unit Q2 in Newport on December 17 and 18 in 2004. From January 4 to January 8 and from January 11 to 14 scenes at Cardiff Royal Infirmary were filmed. From January 9 to January 10 scenes shot in alleyways were filmed in Womanby Street, Cardiff. The bar scenes were also shot on January 10 at Headlands School in Penarth. The scene in which Rose hangs from a barage ballon was filmed in a hangar at RAF St At and than in the Vale of Glamorgan, on January 17. From January 18 to January 20 filming of scenes involing Jack's ship and the TARDIS took place at the studio at Unit Q2. Extra tardis scenes were shot on February 7. Scenes in the Lloyd's house were filmed on January 28. Glamorgan House in Cardiff was used for the officers' club scene on February 8. Location filming took place at the Barry Tourist Railway. Barry Island and its now-demolished Butlins holiday camp had previously been the filming location of the Seventh Doctor serial, \"Delta and the Bannermen\".\n\nThe sound of Dr Constantine's skull cracking as his face changes into a gas mask was considered too horrific in its full form by the production team and was cut before broadcast. However, writer Steven Moffat claims on the DVD commentary to this episode that the sound was discussed but never put on. According to the \"Doctor Who Confidential\" episode \"Fear Factor\", the effect was added in the version of the episode presented on \"The Complete First Series\" box set. Casting for Captain Jack Harkness began around June with particular consideration to John Barrowman per the request of executive producer Julie Gardener.\n\nUnlike previous episodes, the \"next episode\" trailers were shown after the end credits instead of immediately preceding them, possibly in reaction to comments after \"Aliens of London\" about having the cliffhanger for that episode spoiled. This trend has continued for most two-part stories in the new series.\n\nFrequently in this episode, Rose makes references to the \"Star Trek\" character Mr. Spock. This is the first televised \"Doctor Who\" story to make a direct reference to \"Star Trek\". Writer Steven Moffat says in the DVD commentary for this episode that the Doctor's reply to Rose asking him what she should call him (\"Doctor who?\") was originally going to be, \"I'd rather have \"Doctor Who\" than \"Star Trek\",\" a metafictional dig at the latter programme. The Chula ships are named after Chula, an Indian/Bangladeshi fusion restaurant in Hammersmith, London where the writers celebrated and discussed their briefs on the scripts they were to write for the season after being commissioned by Russell T Davies. This meeting was videotaped, and is available on the DVD release of Doctor Who — The Complete First Series.\n\nThe episode was initially smaller in scale and personal with writer Steven Moffat saying that \"there was no big enemy and the major fear factor was a little boy looking for his mummy. Doctor Who can be small and domestic, and brilliantly effective.\"\n\n\"The Empty Child\" received overnight ratings of 6.6 million viewers, a 34.9% audience share. When final ratings were calculated, the figure rose to 7.11 million viewers. The episode received an Audience Appreciation Index score of 84.\n\n\"SFX\" stated that the two-part story had \"everything\", particularly praising Moffat's script. In 2012, Dave Golder of the magazine labelled \"The Empty Child\" as a good example of the science fiction \"Creepy Kid Episode\". Dek Hogan of Digital Spy disliked Barrowman as Captain Jack, but called it a \"particularly creepy episode of the series\" despite Jack and \"the brevity of Richard Wilson's neat and spooky little cameo\". He later called \"The Empty Child\" and \"The Doctor Dances\" the best episodes of the series. \"Now Playing\" magazine reviewer Arnold T. Blumburg gave the episode a grade of a B, describing it as \"solid\" with elements of the original series, though he noted a lot was thrown at the audience and he was not impressed with Barrowman's Jack yet.\n\nIn a poll conducted by \"Doctor Who Magazine\" in 2009, the two-part story was ranked the fifth best episode of \"Doctor Who\". In a similar poll conducted in 2014, readers ranked the two-part story the seventh best \"Doctor Who\" story of all time. \"The Daily Telegraph\" named the story the fourth best of the show in 2008. In 2011 before the second half of the sixth series, \"The Huffington Post\" labelled \"The Empty Child\" and \"The Doctor Dances\" as one of five essential episodes for new viewers to watch. In 2013 Doctor Who TV rated The Empty Child as the twentieth scariest villain.\n\n\"The Empty Child\", along with its conclusion \"The Doctor Dances\", won the 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form).\n\n"}

Originally established in 1948 at Crandon Park in Key Biscayne, Zoo Miami relocated in 1980 as Miami MetroZoo to the former location of the Richmond Naval Air Station, southwest of Miami in southern metropolitan Miami-Dade County, in the center of the census-designated places of Three Lakes (north), South Miami Heights (south), Palmetto Estates (east) and Richmond West (west).\n\nThe only tropical zoo in the continental United States, Zoo Miami houses over 3,000 animals on nearly , of which are developed. It is about around if walked on the path, and features over 100 exhibits. The zoo's communications director is wildlife expert and photographer Ron Magill. He frequently appears on local talk shows and news stations, often promoting the zoo and its wildlife. Zoo Miami is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).\n\nThe history of Zoo Miami can be traced back to 1948, when a small road show, stranded near Miami, exchanged three monkeys, a goat and two black bears for approximately $270 in repairs for the truck. These six animals were the beginning of the Crandon Park Zoo at Crandon Park on the island of Key Biscayne, just southeast off the coast from downtown Miami. The Crandon Park Zoo occupied of the park. The first animals in the zoo, including some lions, an elephant and a rhinoceros, had been stranded when a circus went out of business in Miami. Some Galapagos tortoises, monkeys and pheasants were added from the Matheson plantation. By 1967, the Crandon Park Zoo had grown to over 1,200 animals, and was considered one of the top 25 zoos in the country.\nOther animals were added, including a white Bengal tiger in 1968.\n\nIn 1965, Hurricane Betsy devastated the zoo and killed 250 animals. After the hurricane there was talk of a new zoo for Dade County, but not until 11 December 1970 did Dade County officials apply for of land in the Richmond Naval Air Station property. Construction began in 1975. The zoo opened on July 4, 1980 as Miami MetroZoo with a preview section of 12 exhibits and Asia, the first major exhibit, opened on December 12, 1981. A total of 38 exhibits, covering , were open to the public at this time.\n\nIn the 1980s, the zoo continued to expand. An additional with six new African hoofed stock exhibits opened in 1982, along with the zoo's monorail in 1984. After the closing of 1984 Louisiana World Exposition in New Orleans, monorails were being moved in Florida and re-used at Miami MetroZoo. Wings of Asia, a free-flight aviary, was opened in December 1984. Three additional African hoofed stock exhibits followed in 1985, and two new exhibits were opened in the African savanna section in 1986. The Australian section of the zoo was opened in 1989, and PAWS, the children's petting zoo, opened in 1989. The Asian Riverlife Experience opened in August 1990.\n\nIn 1992, the zoo suffered extensive damage when Hurricane Andrew made landfall in South Florida on August 24. The small, yet intensely powerful category 5 hurricane toppled over 5,000 trees and destroyed the Wings of Asia aviary—which had been built to withstand winds of up to —resulting in the loss of approximately 100 of the 300 resident birds. Despite the majority of the zoo's animals remaining outside during the duration and aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, only five animals were killed from either debris or the consumption of contaminated water. MetroZoo, though looking dramatically different, was reopened on December 18, 1992; with the zoo's tiger temple exhibit renamed in honor of Naomi Browning, a local 12-year-old zoo volunteer who was one of the storm's casualties. By July 1993, many of the animals that were sent to other zoos and animal parks across the United States during the zoo's reconstruction had been returned to MetroZoo, and over 7,000 new trees had been planted to begin restoring the zoo's tree canopy.\n\nIn 1994, stray dogs entered the zoo during off-hours and killed five Thomson's gazelles and two Grant's gazelles. In 1996, a brush fire burned 100 acres in the southeast portion of the zoo's undeveloped land. Nearly 30 animals from neighboring exhibits were evacuated. The Falcon Batchelor Komodo Dragon Encounter opened that same year, followed by Andean Condor (1999), Meerkats (2000), Cuban Crocodiles and Squirrel Monkeys (2001), and Dr. Wilde's World, which is an indoor facility for traveling zoological exhibits. The rebuilt Wings of Asia aviary, housing more than 300 individuals representing 70 species of birds, opened in the spring of 2003.\n\nOn July 4, 2010, the zoo was renamed the Miami-Dade Zoological Park and Gardens, or Zoo Miami, for marketing and branding purposes. This was a part of the zoo's 30th anniversary celebration. The zoo broke ground on a $43 million project that included an Everglades exhibit and a new state-of-the-art entryway. The Everglades exhibit opened on December 10, 2016.\n\nIn 2017, the zoo was struck by Hurricane Irma, which impacted South Florida on September 10. The Amazon and Beyond exhibit suffered the most damage, with widespread tree loss in that area. According to the zoo, one American flamingo, one Great hornbill, and a few other birds died reportedly due to stress. The zoo remained closed until October.\n\nZoo Miami supports conservation programs at the local, national and global level, and was a founding member of the AZA's Butterfly Conservation Initiative (BFCI), a program designed to assemble non-governmental organizations and government agencies to aid in the population recovery of imperiled butterflies in North America.\n\nThe zoo has also provided financial help through the Zoo Miami Conservation Fund to upgrade captive breeding facilities in Thailand zoos for endangered clouded leopards and fishing cats.\n\nThere are five main exhibit sections in the zoo: Florida: Mission Everglades, Asia, Africa, Amazon and Beyond, and Australia. The zoo's main entry includes an entryway canopy structure, conjoining ticket booths, and an adjacent American flamingo exhibit. At the junction of the zoo's main pathways, is Dr. Wilde's World, an indoor pavilion, featuring seasonal interactive exhibits. The property includes a large lake, called Lake Iguana.\n\nAn air-conditioned monorail system loops around the zoo's premises, providing both an aerial view of the zoo and a convenient way to move between sections. The monorail system has four stations, each found throughout the zoo. Narrated tram rides and guided tours are given daily.\n\nThe Florida: Mission Everglades exhibit features native fauna and flora species found in Florida, particularly from the state's Everglades region. The $33 million project features Lostman's River Ride, a gentle air boat ride attraction.\n\nThe zoo's Asian exhibit features dozens of animals. The multi-leveled Asian Riverlife Experience replicates the surrounding and appearance of an Oriental river brook. Guests can also see the zoo's asian elephants or get close to and brush an Indian rhinoceros at the Kaziranga Camp Rhino Encounter. Zoo Miami is only one of two zoos in the United States to display a pair of black-necked storks.\n\nThe zoo's orangutan exhibit once housed Nonja, a female Sumatran orangutan that was relocated from a Dutch zoo to Zoo Miami. She was widely believed to be the oldest living specimen of her species, until her death in 2007. Another notable resident was Carlita, a 21-year-old female white Bengal tiger, who resided in the zoo's tiger enclosure from 1994 until her death in 2013.\n\nThe American Banker's Family Aviary, Wings of Asia is also located here. The aviary features 300 rare birds of 70 species in a temperate mixed forest, and it highlights the evolutionary connection of birds to dinosaurs. At , it is the largest open-air Asian aviary in the Western Hemisphere. The Children's Zoo, hosts special animals that can be approached to a close distance by guests. Guests can view meerkats, a petting zoo, an exhibit that displays small species of reptiles, amphibians and insects, butterfly gardens, a carousel dedicated to individual animal species, and experience traditional camel rides.\n\nThe African lobe of the zoo offers animals from different locations on the African continent. Visitors can get eye-to-eye and feed reticulated giraffes at the Samburu Giraffe Feeding Station for a small fee, watch a pygmy hippo swim, and check out African elephants, black rhinoceroses, zebras, and okapis. Oasis Grill, a small eatery plaza, is situated at the northern end of the African exhibits.\n\nAmazon and Beyond, situated in the zoo's northwest corner, opened on December 6, 2008. This area has dedicated to the flora and fauna of Central and South America, and is sub-divided into four distinct areas: Village Plaza, Cloud Forest, Amazon Flooded Forest, and Atlantic Forest. The first area provides guests an immersive experience for the unique culture found in central and southern American civilizations. The remaining three areas represent native habitats that are found in the Amazonian region, including the \"cloud forest\", the Amazon River basin, and the Atlantic Forest-Pantanal.\n\nThe zoo's Australian habitat showcases specimens from throughout the region of Oceania. Situated near this to habitat, is the 800-seat Sami Family Amphitheater, where daily animal presentations, concerts and cultural events are held. The amphitheater is named in memory of Albert and Winifred Sami, who anonymously donated an estimated $3 million to the zoo from 1993 until their deaths in 2007 and 2014, respectively. Zoo Miami recently celebrated the birth of a baby Koala, who was actually born in May, 2019, but only emerged from its mothers pouch on January 8, 2020. The baby koala was named Hope in light of the recent fires that devastated Australia.\n\nThe Zoo Miami Foundation is a group setup as the non-profit support organization of Zoo Miami. It was founded in 1956 and is responsible for improvements over the years of the zoo. Key members of the foundation include Senator Dwight M. Bullard and Diana L. Fitzgerald, among others.\n\n\n"}

He was born in Shifnal, Shropshire and died in Bristol fifteen years after opening his medical practice there. He was a reforming practitioner and teacher of medicine, and an associate of leading scientific figures. He worked to treat tuberculosis.\n\nBeddoes was a friend of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and, according to E. S. Shaffer, an important influence on Coleridge's early thinking, introducing him to the higher criticism. The poet Thomas Lovell Beddoes was his son. A painting of him by Samson Towgood Roch is in the National Portrait Gallery, London.\n\nBeddoes was born in Shifnal on 13 April 1760 at Balcony House. He was educated at Bridgnorth Grammar School and Pembroke College, Oxford. He enrolled in the University of Edinburgh's medical course in the early 1780s. There he was taught chemistry by Joseph Black and natural history by Kendall Walker. He also studied medicine in London under John Sheldon. In 1784 he published a translation of Lazzaro Spallanzani's \"Dissertations on Natural History\", and in 1785 produced a translation, with original notes, of Torbern Olof Bergman's \"Essays on Elective Attractions\".\n\nHe took his degree of doctor of medicine at Pembroke College, Oxford University in 1786.\n\nIn 1794, he married Anna, daughter of his associate at the Bristol Pneumatic Institution, Richard Lovell Edgeworth. Their son, poet Thomas Lovell Beddoes, was born in 1803 in Bristol.\n\nBeddoes visited Paris after 1786, where he became acquainted with Lavoisier. Beddoes was appointed professor of chemistry at Oxford University in 1788. His lectures attracted large and appreciative audiences; but his sympathy with the French Revolution excited a clamour against him, he resigned his readership in 1792. In the following year he published the \"History of Isaac Jenkins\", a story which powerfully exhibits the evils of drunkenness, and of which 40,000 copies are reported to have been sold.\n\nBeddoes addressed tuberculosis, seeking treatments for the disease. He had a clinic in Bristol from 1793 to 1799 and later began the Pneumatic Institution to test various gases for the treatment of tuberculosis. The institution was later changed to a general hospital.\n\nBetween 1793 and 1799 Beddoes had a clinic at Hope Square, Hotwells in Bristol where he treated patients with tuberculosis. On the principle that butchers seemed to suffer less from tuberculosis than others, he kept cows in a byre alongside the building and encouraged them to breathe on his patients. This became the source of local ridicule, amongst claims that animals were kept in the clinic's bedrooms, against the protests of landlords.\n\nDespite the link he saw between proximity to cows and lower incidence of tuberculosis, he remained sceptical when Edward Jenner began using a cow-derived vaccination for smallpox a few years later.\n\nWhile living in Hotwells he began work on a project to establish an institution for treating disease by the inhalation of different gases, which he called pneumatic medicine.\n\nHe was assisted by Richard Lovell Edgeworth. In 1799 the Pneumatic Institution was established at Dowry Square, Hotwells. Its first superintendent was Humphry Davy, who investigated the properties of nitrous oxide in its laboratory. The original aim of the institution was gradually abandoned; it became a general hospital, and was relinquished by its founder in the year before his death.\n\nBesides the writings mentioned above, Beddoes was also associated with the following:\n\n\nBeddoes edited the second edition of John Brown's \"Elements of Medicine\" (1795).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1850601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850601", "title": "Click chemistry", "text": "Click chemistry\n\nIn chemical synthesis, \"click\" chemistry is a class of biocompatible small molecule reactions commonly used in bioconjugation, allowing the joining of substrates of choice with specific biomolecules. Click chemistry is not a single specific reaction, but describes a way of generating products that follow examples in nature, which also generates substances by joining small modular units. In many applications, click reactions join a biomolecule and a reporter molecule. Click chemistry is not limited to biological conditions: the concept of a \"click\" reaction has been used in pharmacological and various biomimetic applications. However, they have been made notably useful in the detection, localization and qualification of biomolecules.\n\nClick reactions occur in one pot, are not disturbed by water, generate minimal and inoffensive byproducts, and are \"spring-loaded\"—characterized by a high thermodynamic driving force that drives it quickly and irreversibly to high yield of a single reaction product, with high reaction specificity (in some cases, with both regio- and stereo-specificity). These qualities make click reactions particularly suitable to the problem of isolating and targeting molecules in complex biological environments. In such environments, products accordingly need to be physiologically stable and any byproducts need to be non-toxic (for \"in vivo\" systems).\n\nBy developing specific and controllable bioorthogonal reactions, scientists have opened up the possibility of hitting particular targets in complex cell lysates. Recently, scientists have adapted click chemistry for use in live cells, for example using small molecule probes that find and attach to their targets by click reactions. Despite challenges of cell permeability, bioorthogonality, background labeling, and reaction efficiency, click reactions have already proven useful in a new generation of pulldown experiments (in which particular targets can be isolated using, for instance, reporter molecules which bind to a certain column), and fluorescence spectrometry (in which the fluorophore is attached to a target of interest and the target quantified or located). More recently, novel methods have been used to incorporate click reaction partners onto and into biomolecules, including the incorporation of unnatural amino acids containing reactive groups into proteins and the modification of nucleotides. These techniques represent a part of the field of chemical biology, in which click chemistry plays a fundamental role by intentionally and specifically coupling modular units to various ends.\n\nThe term \"click chemistry\" was coined by K. Barry Sharpless in 1998, and was first fully described by Sharpless, Hartmuth Kolb, and M.G. Finn of The Scripps Research Institute in 2001.\n\nClick chemistry is a method for attaching a probe or substrate of interest to a specific biomolecule, a process called bioconjugation. The possibility of attaching fluorophores and other reporter molecules has made click chemistry a very powerful tool for identifying, locating, and characterizing both old and new biomolecules.\n\nOne of the earliest and most important methods in bioconjugation was to express a reporter on the same open reading frame as a biomolecule of interest. Notably, GFP was first (and still is) expressed in this way at the N- or C- terminus of many proteins. However, this approach comes with several difficulties. For instance, GFP is a very large unit and can often affect the folding of the protein of interest. Moreover, by being expressed at either terminus, the GFP adduct can also affect the targeting and expression of the desired protein. Finally, using this method, GFP can only be attached to proteins, and not post-translationally, leaving other important biomolecular classes (nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, etc.) out of reach.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, chemists have opted to proceed by identifying pairs of bioorthogonal reaction partners, thus allowing the use of small exogenous molecules as biomolecular probes. A fluorophore can be attached to one of these probes to give a fluorescence signal upon binding of the reporter molecule to the target—just as GFP fluoresces when it is expressed with the target.\n\nNow limitations emerge from the chemistry of the probe to its target. In order for this technique to be useful in biological systems, click chemistry must run at or near biological conditions, produce little and (ideally) non-toxic byproducts, have (preferably) single and stable products at the same conditions, and proceed quickly to high yield in one pot. Existing reactions, such as Staudinger ligation and the Huisgen 1,3–dipolar cycloaddition, have been modified and optimized for such reaction conditions. Today, research in the field concerns not only understanding and developing new reactions and repurposing and re-understanding known reactions, but also expanding methods used to incorporate reaction partners into living systems, engineering novel reaction partners, and developing applications for bioconjugation.\n\nFor a reaction to be considered a click reaction, it must satisfy certain characteristics:\n\n\nThe process would preferably:\n\nMany of the click chemistry criteria are subjective, and even if measurable and objective criteria could be agreed upon, it is unlikely that any reaction will be perfect for every situation and application. However, several reactions have been identified that fit the concept better than others:\n\n\nThe classic click reaction is the copper-catalyzed reaction of an azide with an alkyne to form a 5-membered heteroatom ring: a Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). The first triazole synthesis, from diethyl acetylenedicarboxylate and phenyl azide, was reported by Arthur Michael in 1893. Later, in the middle of the 20th century, this family of 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions took on Huisgen's name after his studies of their reaction kinetics and conditions.\n\nThe copper(I)-catalysis of the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition was discovered concurrently and independently by the groups of Valery V. Fokin and K. Barry Sharpless at the Scripps Research Institute in California and Morten Meldal in the Carlsberg Laboratory, Denmark. The copper-catalyzed version of this reaction gives only the 1,4-isomer, whereas Huisgen's non-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition gives both the 1,4- and 1,5-isomers, is slow, and requires a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius.\n\nMoreover, this copper-catalyzed “click” does not require ligands on the metal, although accelerating ligands such as tris(triazolyl)methyl amine ligands with various substituents have been reported and used with success in aqueous solution. Other ligands such as PPh3 and TBIA can also be used, even though PPh is liable to Staudinger ligation with the azide substituent. CuO in water at room temperature was found also to catalyze the same reaction in 15 minutes with 91% yield.\n\nThe first reaction mechanism proposed included one catalytic copper atom; but isotope, kinetic, and other studies have suggested a dicopper mechanism may be more relevant. Even though this reaction proceeds effectively at biological conditions, copper in this range of dosage is cytotoxic. Solutions to this problem have been presented, such as using water-soluble ligands on the copper to enhance cell penetration of the catalyst and thereby reduce the dosage needed, or to use chelating ligands to further increase the effective concentration of Cu(I) and thereby decreasing the actual dosage.\n\nAlthough the Cu(I)-catalyzed variant was first reported by Meldal and co-workers for the synthesis of peptidotriazoles on solid support, they needed more time to discover the full scope of the reaction and were overtaken by the publicly more recognized Sharpless. Meldal and co-workers also chose not to label this reaction type \"click chemistry\" which allegedly caused their discovery to be largely overlooked by the mainstream chemical society. Sharpless and Fokin independently described it as a reliable catalytic process offering \"an unprecedented level of selectivity, reliability, and scope for those organic synthesis endeavors which depend on the creation of covalent links between diverse building blocks.\"\n\nAn analogous RuAAC reaction catalyzed by ruthenium, instead of copper, was reported by the Jia and Folkin groups in 2005, and allows for the selective production of 1,5-isomers.\n\nThe Bertozzi group further developed one of Huisgen's copper-free click reactions to overcome the cytotoxicity of the CuAAC reaction. Instead of using Cu(I) to activate the alkyne, the alkyne is instead introduced in a strained difluorooctyne (DIFO), in which the electron-withdrawing, propargylic, gem-fluorines act together with the ring strain to greatly destabilize the alkyne. This destabilization increasing the reaction driving force, and the desire of the cycloalkyne to relieve its ring strain.\n\nThis reaction proceeds as a concerted [3+2] cycloaddition in the same mechanism as the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. Substituents other than fluorines, such as benzene rings, are also allowed on the cyclooctyne.\n\nThis reaction has been used successfully to probe for azides in living systems, even though the reaction rate is somewhat slower than that of the CuAAC. Moreover, because the synthesis of cyclooctynes often gives low yield, probe development for this reaction has not been as rapid as for other reactions. But cyclooctyne derivatives such as DIFO, dibenzylcyclooctyne (DIBO) and biarylazacyclooctynone (BARAC) have all been used successfully in the SPAAC reaction to probe for azides in living systems.\n\nDiaryl-strained-cyclooctynes including dibenzylcyclooctyne (DIBO) have also been used to react with 1,3-nitrones in strain-promoted alkyne-nitrone cycloadditions (SPANC) to yield N-alkylated isoxazolines.\n\nBecause this reaction is metal-free and proceeds with fast kinetics (k2 as fast as 60 1/Ms, faster than both the CuAAC or the SPAAC) SPANC can be used for live cell labeling. Moreover, substitution on both the carbon and nitrogen atoms of the nitrone dipole, and acyclic and endocyclic nitrones are all tolerated. This large allowance provides a lot of flexibility for nitrone handle or probe incorporation.\n\nHowever, the isoxazoline product is not as stable as the triazole product of the CuAAC and the SpAAC, and can undergo rearrangements at biological conditions. Regardless, this reaction is still very useful as it has notably fast reaction kinetics.\n\nThe applications of this reaction include labeling proteins containing serine as the first residue: the serine is oxidized to aldehyde with NaIO and then converted to nitrone with p-methoxybenzenethiol, N-methylhydroxylamine and p-ansidine, and finally incubated with cyclooctyne to give a click product. The SPANC also allows for multiplex labeling.\n\nStrained alkenes also utilize strain-relief as a driving force that allows for their participation in click reactions. Trans-cycloalkenes (usually cyclooctenes) and other strained alkenes such as oxanorbornadiene react in click reactions with a number of partners including azides, tetrazines and tetrazoles. These reaction partners can interact specifically with the strained alkene, staying bioorthogonal to endogenous alkenes found in lipids, fatty acids, cofactors and other natural products.\n\nOxanorbornadiene (or another activated alkene) reacts with azides, giving triazoles as a product. However, these product triazoles are not aromatic as they are in the CuAAC or SPAAC reactions, and as a result are not as stable. The activated double bond in oxanobornadiene makes a triazoline intermediate that subsequently spontaneously undergoes a retro Diels-alder reaction to release furan and give 1,2,3- or 1,4,5-triazoles. Even though this reaction is slow, it is useful because oxabornodiene is relatively simple to synthesize. The reaction is not, however, entirely chemoselective.\n\nStrained cyclooctenes and other activated alkenes react with tetrazines in an inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder followed by a retro [4+2] cycloaddition (see figure). Like the other reactions of the trans-cyclooctene, ring strain release is a driving force for this reaction. Thus, three-membered and four-membered cycloalkenes, due to their high ring strain, make ideal alkene substrates.\n\nSimilar to other [4+2] cycloadditions, electron-donating substituents on the dienophile and electron-withdrawing substituents on the diene accelerate the inverse-demand diels-alder. The diene, the tetrazine, by virtue of having the additional nitrogens, is a good diene for this reaction. The dienophile, the activated alkene, can often be attached to electron-donating alkyl groups on target molecules, thus making the dienophile more suitable for the reaction.\n\nThe tetrazole-alkene “photoclick” reaction is another dipolar addition that Huisgen first introduced about 50 years ago (ChemBioChem 2007, 8, 1504. (68) Clovis, J. S.; Eckell, A.; Huisgen, R.; Sustmann, R. Chem. Ber. 1967, 100, 60.) Tetrazoles with amino or styryl groups that can be activated by UV light at 365 nm (365 does not damage cells) react quickly (so that the UV light does not have to be on for a long time, usually around 1–4 minutes) to make fluorogenic pyrazoline products. This reaction scheme is well suited for the purpose of labeling in live cells, because UV light at 365 nm damages cells minimally. Moreover, the reaction proceeds quickly, so that the UV light can be administered for short durations. Quantum yields for short wavelength UV light can be higher than 0.5. This allows tetrazoles to be used wavelength selectively in combination with another photoligation reaction, where at the short wavelength the tetrazole ligation reaction proceeds nearly exclusively and at longer wavelength another reaction (ligation via o-quinodimethanes) proceeds exclusively. Finally, the non-fluorogenic reactants give rise to a fluorogenic product, equipping the reaction with a built-in spectrometry handle.\n\nBoth tetrazoles and the alkene groups have been incorporated as protein handles as unnatural amino acids, but this benefit is not unique. Instead, the photoinducibility of the reaction makes it a prime candidate for spatiotemporal specificity in living systems. Challenges include the presence of endogenous alkenes, though usually cis (as in fatty acids) they can still react with the activated tetrazole.\n\nThe commercial potential of click chemistry is great. The fluorophore rhodamine has been coupled onto norbonene, and reacted with tetrazine in living systems. In other cases, SPAAC between a cyclooctyne-modified fluorophore and azide-tagged proteins allowed the selection of these proteins in cell lysates.\n\nMethods for the incorporation of click reaction partners into systems in and ex vivo contribute to the scope of possible reactions. The development of unnatural amino acid incorporation by ribosomes has allowed for the incorporation of click reaction partners as unnatural side groups on these unnatural amino acids. For example, an UAA with an azide side group provides convenient access for cycloalkynes to proteins tagged with this “AHA” unnatural amino acid. In another example, “CpK” has a side group including a cyclopropane alpha to an amide bond that serves as a reaction partner to tetrazine in an inverse diels-alder reaction.\n\nThe synthesis of luciferin exemplifies another strategy of isolating reaction partners, which is to take advantage of rarely-occurring, natural groups such as the 1,2-aminothiol, which appears only when a cysteine is the final N’ amino acid in a protein. Their natural selectivity and relative bioorthogonality is thus valuable in developing probes specific for these tags. The above reaction occurs between a 1,2-aminothiol and a 2-cyanobenzothiazole to make luciferin, which is fluorescent. This luciferin fluorescence can be then quantified by spectrometry following a wash, and used to determine the relative presence of the molecule bearing the 1,2-aminothiol. If the quantification of non-1,2-aminothiol-bearing protein is desired, the protein of interest can be cleaved to yield a fragment with a N’ Cys that is vulnerable to the 2-CBT.\n\nAdditional applications include:\n\nIn combination with combinatorial chemistry, high-throughput screening, and building chemical libraries, click chemistry has sped up new drug discoveries by making each reaction in a multistep synthesis fast, efficient, and predictable.\n\nThe Scripps Research Institute has a portfolio of click-chemistry patents. Licensees include Invitrogen, Allozyne, Aileron, Integrated Diagnostics, and the biotech company baseclick, a BASF spin-off created to sell products made using click chemistry. Moreover, baseclick holds a worldwide exclusive license for the research and diagnostic market for the nucleic acid field.\nFluorescent azides and alkynes also produced by such companies as Active Motif Chromeon and Cyandye\n\n\n"}

It is the largest seminary of the ELCA. It also accepts and educates students of 41 other denominations and traditions. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and the Association of Theological Schools. It also has theological accreditation through the ELCA as well as the United Methodist Church.\n\nLuther Seminary is the result of a series of mergers that consolidated what at one time were five separate institutions into one seminary.\n\nIn 1917, three Norwegian-American Lutheran churches united to create the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America (NLCA). Each of the three churchbodies had operated a seminary. The Norwegian Synod's Luther Seminary in Saint Paul, Minnesota, had been founded in 1876; the Hauge Synod's Red Wing Seminary in Red Wing, Minnesota, in 1879; and the United Norwegian Lutheran Church's United Church Seminary in Saint Paul, in 1892. The merged seminaries occupied the site of the United Church Seminary because it was the most developed and elaborate, and retained the name of the oldest of the three schools, namely, Luther Theological Seminary.\n\nThe NLCA took the name Evangelical Lutheran Church in 1946 and, with other churches, formed the American Lutheran Church (ALC) in 1960.\n\nThe presidents of Luther Theological Seminary were:\n\nAugsburg Theological Seminary, later renamed Augsburg University, was founded in 1869 at Marshall, Wisconsin, later moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and in 1897 became the seminary of the Lutheran Free Church. It remained a separate seminary until 1963, at which time the Lutheran Free Church merged with the American Lutheran Church and Augsburg Seminary was merged with Luther Theological Seminary. The merged institution took the Luther Theological Seminary name and the 1869 founding date of Augsburg Seminary.\n\nNorthwestern Lutheran Theological Seminary traces its origin to the Chicago Lutheran Divinity School, begun in Chicago, Illinois, in 1920 following action taken by the English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of the Northwest, a synod of the United Lutheran Church in America. In 1921, the seminary was moved to Fargo, North Dakota, and the following year to Minneapolis. From 1921 to 1982, its name was Northwestern Lutheran Theological Seminary. Located in north Minneapolis from 1922 to 1940 and in south Minneapolis from 1940 to 1967, it moved near the campus of Luther Theological Seminary in Saint Paul in 1967. At the time of the formation of the Lutheran Church in America (LCA) in 1962, Northwestern Lutheran Theological Seminary was placed under the jurisdiction of two supporting synods: the Minnesota Synod and the Red River Valley Synod.\n\nThe presidents of Northwestern Lutheran Theological Seminary were:\n\n\nDesiring to make witness to a shared mission in theological education, Luther and Northwestern seminaries were functionally unified in 1976, beginning with a single administration. After a period of six years, the two seminaries formally merged on July 1, 1982, as Luther Northwestern Theological Seminary.\n\nOn January 1, 1988, Luther Northwestern Theological Seminary became affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which was formed by a merger of the LCA, the ALC, and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches. The seminary's name was simplified to Luther Seminary on July 1, 1994.\n\nIn the 2018–2019 academic year, Luther Seminary served 490 total students, employing 28 faculty. Luther offers a Master of Divinity degree (M.Div.) for students seeking ordination, as well as Master of Arts, Master of Theology, Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.), and Doctor of Philosophy degrees for other students. In the fall of 2013, Luther Seminary suspended new admissions to the Ph.D program for at least three years as part of budget cuts. The seminary was planning to again offer the Ph.D program, with classing beginning in the fall semester of 2018.\n\nAs in most seminaries, M.Div. students complete three years of theological education, divided into a \"junior year\" (first), \"middler year\" (second) and \"senior year\" (final). A full year of internship, usually in a parish, is an integral part of pastoral training, and a degree requirement for ELCA M.Div. students. While individual situations may vary, internship typically begins after two-thirds of coursework has been completed. Thus, most students complete internship between their middler and senior year. The internship requirement is unique to the ELCA among the other mainline denominations in the U.S.\n\nLuther Seminary has affiliations with the acclaimed American theologian and author, Frederick Buechner. In addition to being a key part of the curriculum, the works of Buechner have regularly been distributed by the Seminary among its students. In 2014, Luther Seminary also instituted the Frederick Buechner Prize for Excellence in Preaching.\n\n\n\n"}

She is best known for her time in TNA/Impact Wrestling under the ring name Angelina Love. \n\nBetween ROH and TNA/Impact, Love is a seven-time women's world champion, having held TNA Knockouts Championship six times, along with her Women of Honor title reign.. She is also a one-time TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champion with Winter.\n\nWilliams debuted in wrestling on August 18, 2000 in Hardcore Wrestling Federation in Ontario, Canada, and she wrestled in various independent promotions around Canada under the ring name Angel Williams. Her all-time favorite wrestler Shawn Michaels was her inspiration to get into wrestling. She was first a valet for various wrestlers such as Chris Sabin and Eric Young, and then began in-ring training under Rob Fuego.\n\nWilliams briefly worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in 2004, mainly wrestling on \"TNA Xplosion\" against Trinity.\n\nWilliams was working for promotions in the United States when World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) scouted her, and invited her to a tryout in June 2004. In November, she trained at WWE's then-developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), and WWE signed her to a contract in late 2004. She was assigned to wrestle and train in another WWE developmental territory, Deep South Wrestling (DSW). Williams began managing Johnny Parisi in the summer of 2005. On the September 8, 2005 episode of \"DSW TV\", Williams made her in-ring debut by defeating Michelle McCool. On September 22, Williams was scheduled to wrestle against McCool, but MCcool never showed up. Instead Daisy Mae came out, challenged Williams and Williams defeated Mae in a singles match. At the February 9, 2006 episode of \"DSW TV\", Williams participated in the first ever Bikini Contest in DSW. She did not reveal her bikini because Palmer Cannon interrupted, which led to a match, where Love managed Cannon against Tommy Dreamer. On February 28, she underwent knee surgery in Birmingham, Alabama to repair a torn ACL. After almost seven months of rehab, she stepped back into the ring at a DSW TV taping. At the beginning of November 2006, Williams started managing The Gymini, but The Gymini were released from their contracts in January 2007.\n\nWilliams then began a feud with General Manager of DSW, Krissy Vaine, with Williams claiming that Vaine did something immoral to be appointed General Manager. Over the next couple of weeks, Vaine would cost Williams her matches by forcing other DSW Divas into interfering in Williams's matches. On the January 4 episode of \"DSW TV\", Williams defeated the debuting Brooke Adams, with Vaine on commentary. On the January 11 episode of \"DSW TV\"', Williams competed against Shantelle Taylor in a losing effort. On the January 18 episode of \"DSW TV\", Williams teamed up with Shantelle in a winning effort, defeating Luscious and Tracy Taylor in a tag-team match. On the February 8 episode of \"DSW TV\", Williams defeated Krissy Vaine by disqualification after The Bag Lady attacked Williams. Immediately following the match, Vaine ordered the match to restart, resulting in Vaine pinning Williams. The following week, Williams got a measure of revenge by defeating The Bag Lady. On the April 5, 2007 episode of \"DSW TV\", Williams accompanied Vaine to a match, where she defeated Nattie Neidhart after interference from Williams. Over the following weeks, Williams teamed up with Vaine against Neidhart and Shantelle Taylor, losing to them on several occasions. The storyline, however, came to an end when Deep South Wrestling shut down in April.\n\nAfter DSW shut down, Williams was moved to Ohio Valley Wrestling. Williams made her OVW debut in a dark match at the May 16, 2007 television tapings in Louisville, Kentucky, defeating Serena. Two days later, Williams was released from her developmental contract.\n\nAfter being released from WWE, Williams resurfaced in Mexican promotion AAA, under the name Canadian Angel on June 10, 2007. She also appeared for other independent promotions such as and Full Throttle Wrestling.\nLove made her debut for Great Canadian Wrestling (GCW) on December 27, 2011 at the \"Season's Beatings\" event in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, where she teamed up with Shawn Spears in a losing effort to Seleziya Sparx and Brent Banks in a mixed-tag-team match. Love made her debut for Indian promotion Ring Ka King on March 18, 2012, where she defeated Alissa Flash. After the match, Love began a storyline in which she was being pursued by Romeo and Zoravar. On the April 4 episode of \"Ring Ka King\", Love defeated Raisha and Alissa Flash in a triple-treat match. Following the match, Romeo came to the ring with a gift for Love, but Zoravar would out-do Romeo by giving Love jewelry and a car. On the April 14 episode of \"Ring Ka King\", Love defeated Raisha in a singles match. Following the match, Zoravar confessed that he was in love with Love. On September 22, 2012, during her time with TNA, Love and Velvet Sky reunited as The Beautiful People at a Northeast Wrestling event, where they were defeated by Madison Rayne and Rosita.\n\nLove made her debut for Family Wrestling Entertainment (FWE) on October 4, 2012 at the \"Back 2 Brooklyn\" internet pay-per-view, where she teamed up with Velvet Sky to defeat the FWE Women's Champion Maria Kanellis and Katrina Lea a in a tag team match, with Love pinning Kanellis. Because of the win, Williams was named number one contender, and faced Kanellis for the FWE Women's Championship on February 16, 2013, but was unsuccessful in winning the championship after Mike Bennett helped Maria take advantage. On November 10, Love made her debut for in Sudbury, Suffolk, England, defeating Carmel Jacob by disqualification, following interference from Sara-Marie Taylor. Love then teamed with Erin Angel in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Jacob and Taylor. On February 16, 2013, at \"FWE No Limits\", Love was defeated by the FWE Women's Champion Maria Kanellis in a title match. Love returned to FWE at their \"Openweight Grand Prix\" on October 12, defeating Cheerleader Melissa and Serena Deeb in a three-way match, when she pinned Deeb.\n\nOn February 22, 2013, Daffney announced that Love would be making her debut in the all-female promotion Shine Wrestling, at the event \"Shine 8\". At \"Shine 8\" on March 23, Love teamed up with Mia Yim, Amazing Kong and Christina Von Eerie in a losing effort to the team of Valkyrie (Allysin Kay, Ivelisse, Rain and Taylor Made). On April 19, at the \"Shine 9\" event, Love competed in the Shine Championship qualifying tournament, losing to Rain. On May 24 at the \"Shine 10\" event, Love was unsuccessful in winning the Shine Championship from the reigning champion Rain. Love returned on January 24 at the \"Shine 14\" event, where she defeated Leah von Dutch.\n\nIn June 2007 Williams made several appearances for Mexican promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide as a member of \"La Legión Extranjera\" (Foreign Legion) under the ring name Canadian Angel.\n\nShe returned to the promotion on June 18, 2011, at Triplemanía XIX, where she teamed with Mickie James, Sexy Star and Velvet Sky to defeat Cynthia Moreno, Faby Apache, Mari Apache and Lolita in an eight-woman tag team match.\n\nIn September 2007, she was contacted again by TNA to appear at their annual pay-per-view Bound for Glory, which was confirmed on the October 9 episode of \"TNA Today\" where she was interviewed by Jeremy Borash. At Bound For Glory, Williams participated in a 10 wrestler Gauntlet to crown the first TNA Women's Champion. During the match, she was eliminated by Gail Kim and ODB, and the match was won in the end by Kim. At the Genesis pay-per-view, Williams unsuccessfully challenged for the Knockouts Championship in a fatal-four-way with Gail Kim retaining her title.\n\nWilliams soon began competing under the ring name \"Angelina Love\" and formed a partnership with Velvet Sky, calling themselves \"Velvet-Love Entertainment\", later changed to \"The Beautiful People\". The duo defeated ODB and Roxxi Laveaux at Turning Point in a Tag Team match. During the following months, Love and Sky also aided Gail Kim in her rivalry with Awesome Kong. Love and Sky became villains on the March 13, 2008, episode of \"Impact\" by attacking Laveaux. Love also participated at Lockdown in the first ever \"Queen of the Cage\" match but was pinned by Laveaux.\nAdopting the personas of superficial prima donnas, who loathe and insult anyone they consider to be physically unattractive, they dropped the Velvet-Love Entertainment moniker and became The Beautiful People. In 2008 at Lockdown, they participated in the first ever \"Queen of the Cage\" match, which was won by Roxxi, when she defeated Love in the finals. The following month's pay-per-view, Sacrifice, saw a Battle Royal where the last two in the ring competed in a Ladder match with the loser having their head shaved; the week before on \"Impact!\" Gail Kim won immunity in a Shears-On-A-Pole-Match. The Makeover Battle Royal-Ladder Match saw Kim and Roxxi survive the Battle Royal and with Kim having immunity this meant the third runner-up, Angelina Love, would have her head shaved if Roxxi won. Knowing this, Love interfered in the Ladder Match to ensure Kim's victory and Roxxi's head being shaved bald. While the performers watched the haircut in pity, Love and Sky paraded around celebrating with Roxxi's freshly shaved hair cementing them as villains in one of TNA's most controversial moments.\n\nThe Beautiful People continued to harass the fan favorites, including ruining Kim's chance at winning the TNA Women's Knockout Championship, injuring her, and unsuccessfully attempting to shave ODB's head after a match. This led to a Street Fight on June 5 between Sky and ODB, during which Mickie Knuckles (later renamed Moose) debuted as The Beautiful People's ally on \"Impact!\". At Slammiversary the new trio lost in a six-woman tag team match against Roxxi, ODB and Kim when ODB pinned Moose.\n\nOn July 18, Sky won a ten-wrestler Battle Royal to earn a shot at the Knockouts Championship. However, she failed to win the match, afterwards her and Love assaulted champion Taylor Wilde, putting a paper bag over her head. Their bad luck continued when The Beautiful People main evented the July 31 \"Impact!\" in a losing effort to Wilde and Kim.\n\nOn the edition of August 14 of \"Impact!\", Kip James was introduced as the team's \"fashionist\" under the name Cute Kip. As Sky had failed to win the title from Wilde, Love was given a chance at No Surrender. The following week on \"Impact!\", The Beautiful People tried to intimidate Wilde before No Surrender, by attacking her backstage. Love and Wilde competed in a beauty pageant which Love lost after losing the evening gown and talent contest segments. Love also lost the title match at No Surrender. While Sky and Love had been focussing on Wilde and her title, Kip had begun a feud with Rhino. This feud ended in defeat for the Beautiful People, with them losing to ODB, Rhaka Khan and Rhino at Bound for Glory IV. Their feud with ODB spilled out into an alliance with Booker T who hired The Beautiful People to protect his wife, Sharmell, from ODB in exchange for his locker room on the December 4 episode of \"Impact!\". This resulted in a six-woman tag team match at Final Resolution against ODB, Wilde and Roxxi, which they lost.\nAlso in December it was announced on TNA's website that the company had extended an invitation to United States Vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin which The Beautiful People looked forward to as they considered her husband to be attractive. A Governor Palin parody character, often referred to simply as The Governor, appeared on December 4 played by Shannon Spruill. Love and Sky were oblivious to The Governor being an imposter, resulting in some comedy skits where Kip tried to convince them they were being fooled while others mocked their stupidity. The Governor, meanwhile, convinced the duo that they would have a makeover that would make them worthy of her cabinet; the makeover involved frumpy clothes, no make-up and unstyled hair. On January 15, Taylor Wilde and Roxxi revealed that it had all been a ruse to humiliate The Beautiful People who, in Wilde's opinion, were making a mockery of TNA's women's division. After this they had mud dropped on them from the ceiling. The following week, The Beautiful People brutally attacked Spruill backstage until Kip stopped them after a sufficient beating. On February 5, The Beautiful People exacted revenge on Roxxi and Wilde in a tag match and put paper bags over their heads; however, their revenge was cut short when The Governor made the save.\nWilde's rivalry with The Beautiful People continued when Wilde teamed with the recently debuted Madison Rayne on February 26. Rayne turned on Wilde in the tag team match giving The Beautiful People the win. With Rayne's help, The Beautiful People won a Four Corners Tag Team match against Awesome Kong and Raisha Saeed, Rhaka Khan and Sojourner Bolt, and Wilde and Roxxi. On the edition of March 12 of \"Impact!\", Madison Rayne was formally revealed as an initiate to Mi Pi Sexy (Mi∇⦵) (the newly formed sorority of the group). However, Rayne lost her initiation match to Taylor Wilde. Love and Sky continued to be referred to as \"The Beautiful People\", but when Rayne accompanied them, they were referred to as \"Mi Pi Sexy\". Some time later, the term \"Mi Pi Sexy\" became a nickname, thus being used occasionally on television.\n\nThe Beautiful People began the hazing of Madison Rayne on March 19's \"Impact\", which began with her helping them clip The Governor's hair after Rayne lost her match. Mi Pi Sexy would fight against Wilde, Roxxi, and The Governor at Destination X. Despite the numbers being even with the acquisition of Rayne, The Beautiful People failed to defeat their opponents. Monty Sopp, who played Cute Kip, was removed from television prior to Destination X to become a road agent, meaning his departure from the stable. This was explained on-screen by Sky, who stated that Kip was on probation before declaring he would be spoken about no more.\n\nRayne's hazing continued after The Beautiful People won an \"Impact!\" tag team match against Kong and Saeed, after which Rayne tried to cut the braided hair of the Knockout Champion Kong. With Sky in her corner, Angelina Love faced Kong and perennial nemesis Taylor Wilde in a three-way cage match for the Knockout Championship at Lockdown. Love narrowly escaped a somersault leg drop from Kong, and as she was recovering Love pushed her towards the cage while Sky pulled her frayed hair through the holes in the cage and tied her to it. With Kong unable to move from the cage, Wilde dove onto Love with a cross body press and legitimately knocked her unconscious with her knee. As she recovered, Wilde attacked Kong, allowing Love to roll-up Wilde for the pin and win the Knockout Championship. The following week on \"Impact!\", Mi Pi Sexy had a celebration with male dancers and named Madison Rayne an official member of the Beautiful People. However the celebration was cut short by Kong. Kong continued her attack on Mi Pi Sexy and proved her dominance by making her way through Rayne, Sky and Kip, who Love brought back to stop her, in stretcher matches on the following weeks of \"Impact!\". Despite this, at Sacrifice Love retained her title against Kong.\n\nOn May 28, Love defended her title again against Sojourner Bolt with all of her associates at ringside. After quickly defeating Bolt, Love questioned why Cute Kip was still appearing with them and officially fired him from the group. After this Love made a speech about the dominance of The Beautiful People and mocked the lack of competition in TNA. This led to the debut of Tara who laid out both Sky and Rayne and used her Widow's Peak finisher on Love, before accepting the challenge. At Slammiversary, Tara had her chance at the title but with the help of some hairspray from Sky and Rayne, Love retained the championship. Tara, whose name alludes to the tarantula spider, began taunting the group with tarantulas over the next few weeks on \"Impact!\", which resulted in Sky voicing her frustration about Love leaving her alone with the tarantula and threatening to leave the group, if Love didn't back her up.\nConsequently, when Tara defeated Sky and threatened to place a tarantula on her, Love agreed to put her Knockout Championship on the line immediately afterward, and without Rayne for support, Love lost the championship. The following week Love demanded, and gained a rematch but was laid out with the Widow's Peak from Tara. At Victory Road, Love almost lost her match when she was accidentally blinded with hairspray, but kicked out and later pinned Tara despite her foot being under the bottom rope, to win back the Knockout Championship. Later in the evening the referee was seen leaving Rayne's shower, with the implication she had seduced him to officiate the match in Love's favour.\n\nAfter all three failed to win a Battle Royal to become a member of Main Event Mafia, the group were seen mocking ODB and her associate Cody Deaner. A six-woman tag team match between all of Mi Pi Sexy against Tara, Kong and ODB turned into a three-on-one handicap match when Tara and Kong began to brawl between themselves. After a kiss from Deaner at ringside, Love was stunned and lost the match. It was later announced that at Hard Justice, the Knockout Championship would be on the line in a tag team contest between The Beautiful People against ODB and Deaner. After more mistimed hair spraying from Rayne, ODB won the title by virtue of Deaner pinning Sky. On the edition of August 20 of \"Impact!\", Madison Rayne was kicked out of Mi Pi Sexy for costing Love the title, being assaulted and paper bagged by them.\n\nOn September 3, 2009, Williams was released from TNA due to visa issues, while still a top draw in the women's division. However, on September 7, 2009, Williams posted a blog entry on her MySpace account stating that she would return to TNA Wrestling once the issues with her visa were sorted out. She continued appearing on \"Impact!\" for two more weeks due to the tapings being held before her release. In the episodes she and Velvet Sky advanced to the finals of the tournament for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship with help from Madison Rayne, whom they afterwards welcomed to return to the Beautiful People. Rayne would go on to replace Love in the finals for the Knockouts Tag Team Championship.\n\nAfter her release from TNA, Williams began working for Women Superstars Uncensored (WSU), where she performed under her TNA ring name of Angelina Love. On November 14, 2009, she unsuccessfully challenged Mercedes Martinez for the WSU Championship. On December 12 she teamed with Jennifer Cruz to defeat Jana and Rick Cataldo in a tag team match. After returning to TNA, Williams made one more appearance for WSU, defeating Sassy Stephie at the 3rd Anniversary Show on March 6, 2010.\n\nOn January 2, 2010, it was reported that Williams had re-signed with TNA. Williams, as Angelina Love, made her return on the January 14 episode of \"Impact!\", appearing in the crowd and hugging Velvet Sky and Madison Rayne prior to their match with Awesome Kong and Hamada. However, after the match, Love turned face by attacking her former partners and Lacey Von Erich, her replacement in the group, seemingly angry about being replaced. She made her in-ring return the following week by defeating Rayne, however after the match she was triple teamed by the Beautiful People. On the February 4 episode of \"Impact!\" she was unsuccessful in her attempt to regain the Knockout Championship from Tara. On the March 8 episode of \"Impact!\" Love and Tara teamed up to challenge for the vacant Knockouts Tag Team Championship, but were defeated by Rayne and Sky, after interference from Daffney, with whom Tara was involved in a feud.\n\nOn the April 5 episode of \"Impact!\", Love teamed with Tara, ODB, and Hamada to face the Beautiful People and Daffney in the first ever Lockbox elimination match, contested for four keys to four boxes containing prizes. Love won a key by eliminating Lacey Von Erich, and it was later revealed that her key opened the box, which contained the Knockout Championship, making her a three-time champion. After Love won the title, friction developed between her and Tara heading into their upcoming match against The Beautiful People, with Tara slowly turning villainous. At Lockdown, Love lost the Knockouts Championship to Madison Rayne, after she pinned Tara in a tag team steel cage match, where Love and Tara faced Rayne and Velvet Sky for both the Women's Knockout Championship and the Knockouts Tag Team Championship. After the match, Love was attacked by the evil Tara, who turned villainous in the process. At the April 20 tapings of \"Impact!\", Williams partially tore her biceps and suffered ligament damage in her arm and was expected to be out of action until May. On May 26 it was announced that Williams had been cleared to return to wrestling.\nWhen Love returned from her injury on the June 17 episode of \"Impact!\", she vowed to reclaim the Knockouts title and stated that she would go through each member of the Beautiful People to do it. That night she faced Von Erich and got disqualified after dropping her with a DDT on a steel chair. The following week her match with Velvet Sky ended in similar fashion. On July 11 at Victory Road, Love defeated Rayne via disqualification in a Title vs. Career match to win the Women's Knockout Championship for the fourth time. Prior to the match it was announced that the title would change hands via disqualification, if either Velvet Sky or Lacey Von Erich interfered in the match. However, the title was returned to Rayne on the July 22 episode of \"Impact!\", when it was declared that there was no proof that the person who had interfered in the match was either Sky or Von Erich. The following week Love defeated Sarita to once again become the number one contender to Rayne's title. Two weeks later Love defeated Rayne, after a distraction from Velvet Sky, to win the Women's Knockout Championship for the fifth time.\n\nOn the August 19 episode of Impact!, Love reunited with Velvet Sky, who accompanied her to the ring, when she successfully defended her Women's Knockout Championship in a rematch against Rayne, who was with the mysterious biker woman. After the match Love and Sky were attacked by Rayne and the biker. Rayne's mysterious ally was finally unmasked as Tara on the September 2 episode of \"Impact!\", when the two of them defeated Love and Sky in their first match together in a year. On the edition of September 16 of \"Impact!\" Love and Sky saved Lacey Von Erich, who was making a return from her injury, from a beating at the hands of Rayne and Tara and accepted her back into The Beautiful People. She, however, would leave the promotion two months later on November 11. During the feud Rayne had claimed to own the rights to the name the Beautiful People, but on the October 7 live edition of \"Impact!\", Love and Sky defeated her and Tara in a tag team match to officially earn the right to call themselves the Beautiful People. On October 10 at Bound for Glory Love lost the Women's Knockout Championship to Tara in a Four Corners match, which also included Velvet Sky and Madison Rayne and was refereed by Mickie James.\n\nOn the October 21 episode of \"Impact!\" Love entered a storyline where a woman named Winter started appearing in mirrors, claiming to be her fan, though only Love was able to see her.

On the edition of March 3 of \"Impact!\", Cookie and Robbie E aligned themselves with former \"Jersey Shore\" cast member Angelina Pivarnick, with whom they bonded through their mutual dislike of Jenni \"JWoww\" Farley, whom Pivarnick proceeded to challenge to a match (whom was replaced by Winter). The following week, Love, Velvet Sky and Winter defeated Cookie, Angelina Pivarnick and Sarita in a six wrestler tag team match.\nOn March 13, 2011, at Victory Road, Love and Winter lost the Knockouts Tag Team Championship to Sarita and Rosita, after an interference by Velvet Sky backfired. On the March 24 episode of \"Impact!\", Winter, seemingly having control over Love's actions, prevented her from saving Sky from a beatdown at the hands of Sarita and Rosita. Love was kept under Winter's spell with drinks of what she described as her medicine. On the April 7 episode of \"Impact!\", Love turned heel by attacking Sky during a Knockouts Tag Team Championship match against Sarita and Rosita and left her to be pinned by the champions. On the April 28 episode of \"Impact!\", Love defeated Sky via submission in a singles match, no-selling all of her opponent's offense during the match. On the May 5 episode of \"Impact!\", Sky gained a measure of revenge on her former partner, when she teamed with Kurt Angle in a handicap mixed tag team match, where they defeated Love, Winter and Jeff Jarrett. The feud between the former Beautiful People partners seemingly ended on the May 19 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", with Sky defeating Love and Winter in a handicap match.\n\nThe following week Love attacked Mickie James, after she had defeated Winter in a singles match, setting up a match between the two for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship at Slammiversary IX. Prior to the match at the pay-per-view, Love declined to take her medicine, saying that she no longer needed it as she now understood Winter. After failing in her attempt to win the title, both Love and Winter attacked James. On the June 23 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Love helped Winter defeat James in a non-title Street Fight. On August 7 at Hardcore Justice, Love again helped Winter defeat James, this time to become the new Women's Knockout Champion. On the September 15 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Love failed to earn a shot at the title as she was defeated by Velvet Sky in a qualifying match.\n\nAfter being inactive for two months, Love returned on the January 19 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", challenging Eric Young to a match. Young won the match via disqualification, after Love kicked him in the groin. On the January 26 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Love and Winter lost to ODB and Eric Young in a tag team match, this was Love and Winter's last appearance together as a team. Love competed in a ten wrestler battle royal for the number one contendership for Gail Kim's Knockout Championship on the February 16 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", but was defeated by Madison Rayne. Love wrestled, what turned out to be her final \"Impact Wrestling\" match, on the April 5 episode, where she was defeated in a six-way number one contender's match by Velvet Sky. On June 14, at a TNA house show in Belton, Texas, Love teamed up with Winter for the first time in almost five months, when the two, Rosita and Sarita were defeated in a four-on-three handicap main event by Mickie James, Tara and Velvet Sky. Two days later at another house show in Houston, Texas, Love wrestled her final TNA match, where she and Winter were defeated by Tara and Velvet Sky, when Tara pinned Love.\n\nOn July 1, 2012, Williams announced on her Twitter page that she had been granted her release from TNA.\nAngelina would also turn down an offer to return to the company in March 2013 as TNA reached out for her to appear at a one night PPV event.\n\nIt was announced by TNA that a former TNA Women's Knockout Champion was signed to a contract and would be returning, which would later be revealed to be Love. Love made her return to TNA on the March 13, 2014 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", calling out Velvet Sky wanting to reunite The Beautiful People. Sky would later accept Love's offer on the March 20 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", while Madison Rayne declined due to Love's attitude towards her. Later in the show, Love attacked Rayne, after the two hugged, establishing herself as a heel in the process. On the March 27 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Love defeated Rayne in her returning match due to interference from Sky, who also turned heel, officially returning the original heel incarnation of the stable. The Beautiful People made their in-ring return the following week on \"Impact Wrestling\", defeating Rayne and Brittany, when Love pinned Brittany after a modified \"Makeover\". On the April 10 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Love defeated ODB, Gail Kim and Brittany in a fatal four-way match to become the number one contender to Rayne's Women's Knockout Championship. Later, it was announced that Love suffered a legitimate concussion during the match.\n\nOn the April 24 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", The Beautiful People would once again defeat Rayne in a tag team match, only this time with Gail Kim as her partner. Three days later, at the Sacrifice pay-per-view on April 27, Love defeated Rayne to become a six-time Knockouts Champion, her first reign since 2010. Kim joined the feud after interrupting Love's title celebration which led to Rayne and Brittany stripping The Beautiful People of their evening gowns. This led to a tag team elimination evening gown match on the May 8 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", which The Beautiful People won. In her first title defense, on the May 22 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Love defeated Brittany in an open-challenge match. After the match, Love and Sky would attack Brittany and Gail Kim would make the save. This led to a tag team match, where The Beautiful People defeated Kim and Brittany on the edition of May 29 of \"Impact Wrestling\". Love and Kim would finally face off in a title match on June 15 at the Slammiversary pay-per-view, where Love would successfully defend her championship. On June 20, during the tapings of the July 3 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Love lost the Women's Knockout Championship to Kim, ending her reign at only 67 days.\n\nOn the July 10 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Love unsuccessfully challenged Gail Kim for the title in a four-way match also involving Madison Rayne and Brittany. The Beautiful People would interrupt a championship match between Kim and Taryn Terrell on the July 24 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", leading to a no-contest. This led to a four-way contest for the Women's Knockout Championship between the four women, in which Love was unsuccessful in regaining the title. At Hardcore Justice, Love unsuccessfully challenged Kim for the title in a Last Knockout Standing match. In late 2014, The Beautiful People formed an alliance with The BroMans and regularly teamed with them. On the January 23, 2015 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Velvet Sky retrieved a briefcase for Robbie E during the Feast or Fired match. The briefcase contained the \"pink\" slip and Sky was fired, effectively disbanding The Beautiful People in the process.\n\nLove then separated from The BroMans after they disbanded in April 2015. On the \"TKO: Night of Knockouts\" special episode of \"Impact Wrestling\" on April 24, Love competed in a fatal four–way number one contender's match against Brooke, Gail Kim and Madison Rayne, which Brooke won.

Love and Sky then continued to participate in various matches in both winning and losing efforts with more sporadic appearances from 2017.\n\nOn April 6, 2019, at the G1 Supercard in New York City, Love and Sky made their debut for Ring of Honor as they aligned with Mandy Leon, forming a heel stable known as \"The Allure\". The trio attacked Kelly Klein, who had just won the Women of Honor World Championship against Mayu Iwatani, as well as Jenny Rose and Stella Gray who tried to make the save for Klein. Love and Sky's debut and alliance with Leon in the promotion come just a few weeks after their former stablemate Madison Rayne left and announced that the promotion rejected her Beautiful People reunion but suggested this idea instead. Throughout the summer, The Allure continued their rivalry with Kelly Klein as the trio would attack her before and her matches and defeat her in various tag team matches.

{"id": "1850670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850670", "title": "KrasAir", "text": "KrasAir\n\nKrasAir or Krasnoyarsk Airlines () was a Russian airline with its head office on the grounds of Krasnoyarsk Yemelyanovo Airport in Krasnoyarsk. It operated scheduled regional and international passenger services, freight transport, cargo handling and charter services from the main base is Krasnoyarsk Yemelyanovo Airport, as part of AiRUnion alliance. In 2008 Krasair suffered a liquidity crisis, and after a string of operational shutdowns, administrative and strikes, the company ceased operations in October 2008.\n\nThe company traces its roots to the Krasnoyarsk-based Yenisey air wing, established by the Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route in May, 1934. The air wing eventually differentiated into traditional airline operations, and was as Krasnoyarsk Civil Aviation Directorate (1946–1982) and Krasnoyarsk Aviation Enterprize (1982–1993). In 1993 it was privatized with the state retaining 51% controlling share.\n\nIn October 2004 KrasAir and Domodedovo Airlines set up a joint management company called AirBridge. While retaining separate legal identities the airlines planned to integrate their networks and services, which were largely complementary.\n\nKrasAir was managed by Boris Abramovich (CEO, no relation to Roman Abramovich) and his brother Alexander Abramovich (deputy CEO). The Abramovich brothers' aggressive expansion campaign led to the creation of AiRUnion alliance in 2005, the first airline alliance in Russia. It includes KrasAir, Domodedovo Airlines, Samara Airlines, Omskavia and Sibaviatrans and was the third largest domestic carrier in Russia. All of the member airlines were controlled by Krasair management. \n\nIn 2005 KrasAir attempted to expand internationally, placing a winning bid in Hungary's national carrier Malév privatisation tender. The tender results were initially annulled by Hungarian authorities before finally being sold in February 2007. During 2006 1,118,543 passengers were transported by KrasAir and AiRUnion transported 3,342,815 passengers\n\nKrasAir managers were part of a venture together with the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development to create a new low-cost airline called Sky Express. This airline was to be based at Vnukovo Airport and fly initially to domestic routes, using as many as 44 Boeing 737-300/500s. The airline's airfares were to be 30-40% cheaper than other carriers.\n\nIn June and August 2008 Krasair and AiRUnion fleets were grounded as the fuel suppliers denied further credit fuel to debt-ridden airlines. In June, Krasair and its principal supplier, Krasnoyarsk-based Sibir Avia Service, reached an agreement to resume fuel supply on condition that Krasair debt did not exceed 100 million roubles. By the middle of August the debt rose to 223 million roubles, and on August 19 Sibir Avia stopped refuelling, leaving thousands of passengers stranded in airports. Krasair blamed the crisis on rising oil prices. In first six months of 2008, fuel accounted for 54% of Krasair costs. Flights were also grounded in Moscow and Omsk airports.\n\nAnalysts predicted that the fuel crisis would be resolved through intervention of Rostechhologii, a newly formed state conglomerate that controls substantial shares of AiRUnion companies, including Krasair; alternatively, the state may prefer to complete formal bankruptcy process and restructure AiRUnion assets under a new management. On August 24, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin specifically addressed the problem of the grounded airline, authorizing Sergey Ivanov to issue state funds and enable further operations.\n\nOn August 26, media reports appeared to indicate that bankruptcy was inevitable. Russian Technologies, the principal shareholder, refused to pay AiRUnion's bills and its fleet remained grounded. The same day, the Russian Ministry of Transportation negotiated with Aeroflot, Transaero, S7 Airlines and Rossiya about taking over the routes previously operated by Krasair.\n\nOn October 27, Krasair was unable to fly most of their aircraft due to a pilots' strike as a refusal by refuelling companies to extend credit to the airline. It was announced that Krasair would cease to exist on November 1, 2008.\n\nThe KrasAir fleet consisted of the following aircraft (as it was at May 2008):\n\n"}

He led the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades military wing of Hamas, until his targeted killing by Israel.\n\nBorn in Gaza and a member of Hamas since the formation of the group in 1987, he quickly became one of its most influential leaders and was arrested twice by Israeli authorities in 1984 and 1988. After Yahya Ayash's death, in 1996, Shehade became a top leader in the group, along with Mohammed Deif and Adnan al-Ghoul.\n\nDuring the Al-Aqsa Intifada, Israel accused Shehade of masterminding several attacks against both Israeli soldiers and civilians in the Gaza strip and in Israel proper. He was given a twelve-year prison sentence but released 14 May 2000. It was reported that Shehade was involved in the production of Qassam rockets, fired against Israeli civilian targets, and other homemade weapons, as well as smuggling military equipment into Gaza.\n\nHe led the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades military wing of Hamas during a period which saw a campaign of suicide attacks against Israeli civilian targets which caused the deaths of hundreds of Israeli civilians. As a leader of the Hamas military wing he oversaw Hamas field commanders in Gaza and the West Bank and defined the policy of terror attacks by Hamas.\n\nOn 22 July 2002, the Israeli Defense Forces targeted the house in which Shehade was hiding using a one-ton bomb dropped by an F-16 plane in a neighborhood of Gaza City. Fifteen people were killed, including Shehade, his wife and daughter, and seven members of the Matar family who lived in the next house. Seven children were among the dead.\n\nBetween 50 and 150 were injured as a result of the attack. Both Shehade's and Matar's houses were destroyed by the bomb, as were eight others in the vicinity; nine houses were partially destroyed, and 20 other houses moderately damaged.\n\n27 reserve pilots, including Iftach Spector, signed a pilots' letter refusing to fly assassination sorties over Gaza and the West Bank in protest of the operation.\n\nThe attack received widespread condemnation from other Middle Eastern nations, Western Europe, and the United States. Ariel Sharon initially praised it as \"one of our greatest successes\", but later told \"Yediot Ahronot\" that \"[H]ad I known the outcome, I would have postponed the assassination.\"\n\nFatalities of the attack are as follows:\nHuman rights organizations around the world, including in Israel, severely criticized the attack, proclaiming that the intentional dropping of a one-ton bomb in the middle of the night on a dense civilian neighborhood is tantamount to a war crime. The Gush Shalom movement also threatened to turn the pilot over to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Israeli Air Force Chief Dan Halutz, who was abroad during the bombing itself but was still accountable as IAF commander, gave an interview to \"Haaretz\", published on 21 August 2002. To his pilots he said:\n\nWhen asked whether the operation was morally wrong because of the toll on some civilians, Halutz answered that the planning included moral consideration and that a mistake or an accident did not make it such. When the reporter asked about the feelings of a pilot when he drops a bomb, Halutz answered:\n\nIn the same interview Halutz denounced the left-wing groups who attacked the pilots and called to have them tried for \"treason\":\n\n[Interviewer] Are you suggesting that members of the Gush Shalom (\"Peace Bloc\") group who made those comments should be placed on trial for treason?\n\nFollowing the assassination, the Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet established a joint inquiry into the incident and submitted their findings to Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer on 2 August 2002. The inquiry concluded that the procedures and operational assessments followed in the operation were \"correct and professional\", and that the operation resulted in the elimination of a \"major terrorist leader\". However, the inquiry found shortcomings in the intelligence available and the analysis of intelligence concerning the presence of civilians near Shehade. The inquiry found that if the intelligence had indicated with certainty the presence of civilians in Shehade's vicinity, the timing or method of the action would have been changed, \"as was done a number of times in the past.\"\n\nIn December 2005, a class-action lawsuit was filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights, naming former Shin Bet director Avraham Dichter, the military chief in charge of the operation, as the sole defendant. Referring in particular to the Shehade killing, the lawsuit alleges that Dichter \"developed, implemented and escalated the practice of targeted killings\", Citing the killing of more than 300 Palestinian leaders and casualties among hundreds of bystanders, the suit claims that assassination is illegal under international law.\n\nIn 2007, the Israeli State Prosecutor's Office announced that an independent commission of inquiry into the death of the 14 innocent Palestinian civilians would be held following a petition by Yesh Gvul. Headed by Zvi Inbar, this commission began in February 2008. Its findings were officially released to the public on February 2011, and found \"intelligence gathering failure\" and \"no premeditated intention to kill civilians,\" reporting that commanders did not know there were innocent people in the building at the time, and that they would have called it off had they known.\n\nIn January 2009, the National Audience, a special and exceptional high court in Spain, began a war crimes probe into the attack that killed Shehade, with persons investigated including Mofaz, Dichter, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, Moshe Ya'alon, Doron Almog, Giora Eiland and Mike Herzog. A lower court decision ordered an inquiry into the Shehadeh killing.\n\nThe Spanish Court of Appeals rejected the lower court's decision, and on appeal in April 2010 the Supreme Court of Spain upheld the Court of Appeals decision against conducting an official inquiry into the IDF's targeted killing of Shehadeh in 2002. Israeli MK Moshe Ya'alon (Chief of Staff at the time of the bombing) cancelled a trip to the United Kingdom on 5 October 2009, because he feared an arrest on war crimes charges relating to the 2002 killing.\n\n"}

College Preparatory courses are graded on a 4.0 scale, Honors courses are graded on a 4.5 scale, and Advanced Placement courses are graded on a 5.0 scale.\n\nThe Algonquin girls' soccer team's upset of nationally-ranked Acton-Boxborough Regional High School in the 2009 Massachusetts State Final made local headlines and was even recognized by ESPN. The 2015 girls' soccer team played in the D1 state title but lost to Needham 3-1. The 2019 girls' soccer team played in the D1 state semifinal but lost to Westfield 1-0 in overtime. The Algonquin Boys' Varsity Soccer team captured two straight MIAA Division I State titles in 2004 and 2005. In 2006, they returned to the State Final to play St. John's Preparatory School, but lost 4-1. Also in 2006, the Algonquin Baseball Team won the State Title. Algonquin maintains a strong cross-town rivalry with Westborough High School, in which both teams compete in the annual Thanksgiving Day Football Game. The Boys' Varsity tennis team won the Central Massachusetts Division Title in 2009 and the Girls' team had an undefeated season and eventually won the state title that same year (the Boys' lost to Longmeadow in the state semi-final). In 2010, the Girls' varsity tennis team received a #1 seeding in the state tournament. Girls' Varsity Gymnastics became State Champions in 2011 after an undefeated season, being named both League and Sectional Champions. The Girls' Varsity Gymnastics Team repeated the same feat in 2012. The Boys' lacrosse program won the Central Massachusetts District in 2007, 2011, and 2012 and just falling short of the State Title two years in a row losing to Eastern Mass champions Medfield High School and Concord-Carlisle High School. The Girls' program recently became Central Massachusetts Champions and became the first team in Massachusetts girls lacrosse history to represent Central Massachusetts in the State Final Game; they lost to Eastern Mass powerhouse Westwood High School. The Girls' Rugby team has won the MYRO State championship every year from 2011 to 2015.\n\n\"The Harbinger\" is the official student newspaper of Algonquin Regional. It covers campus-wide events and athletic results in addition to controversial topics within the school. The publication regularly receives honors at the New England Scholastic Press Association conference. The Harbinger won a Gold Crown Award at the Columbia Scholastic Press Association in March 2018.\n\n\"Sachem\" is the literary and art magazine of Algonquin. It is published once a year and is entirely student-run. All poems, stories, artwork, and photography are contributed voluntarily by students. In the 2010-2011 school year it won the Gold Circle Award from Columbia Scholastic Press Association, a prestigious award for literary magazines.\n\nThe Algonquin Music department consists of Chamber choir, Camerata Singers' group, Concert and Freshman choir, as well as Jazz I, Jazz II, Concert Band, Symphonic Band, Orchestra and Wind Ensemble. There are also two student-run a cappella ensembles for students who take music classes- one co-ed (Algonqapella) and one women-only (Ladies First) along with an additional third group for students who do not need to participate in music classes (Soulfege). Extra-curricular activities include Algonquin Acoustic and Musicians Inspiring Change, two music groups that aim to benefit the community through student music performances in which all profits contribute to various charities.\n\n\nUltimately, a $3 million renovation and expansion plan was approved by the district and renovations began in 2003. Due to failures associated with the general contractor, Eastern Contractors Inc., and need for dismissal of the contractor from the project, some delays in completion of the renovation project occurred. In 2005 the regional district fired the contractor from the project. The renovations and expansion efforts complete as a result of efforts by the school district representatives as of the 2008–2009 school year. The grand opening took place on September 4, 2008.\n\nThe school's hallways are labeled by letters and numbers (denoting the floor). Currently, letters go from A-H. Building architect, \"Alicia Conte\", designed the only rotunda in the Massachusetts public High School system as the site for the buildings main entrance. The rotunda holds the main office and school store. The building is divided into the Upper School (Hallways A, B, C, E, and F) and the Lower School (Hallways D, G, and H). The Entrance to the Lower School is on the second floor (H200 Hallway) and this is where the busses drop off students.\n\n"}
{"id": "1850694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850694", "title": "Drawing (manufacturing)", "text": "Drawing (manufacturing)\n\nDrawing is a metalworking process which uses tensile forces to stretch metal glass, or plastic. As the metal is drawn (pulled), it stretches thinner, into a desired shape and thickness. Drawing is classified in two types: sheet metal drawing and wire, bar, and tube drawing. The specific definition for sheet metal drawing is that it involves plastic deformation over a curved axis. For wire, bar, and tube drawing, the starting stock is drawn through a die to reduce its diameter and increase its length. Drawing is usually done at room temperature, thus classified a cold working process, however it may be performed at elevated temperatures to hot work large wires, rods or hollow sections in order to reduce forces. \n\nDrawing differs from rolling in that the pressure of drawing is not transmitted through the turning action of the mill but instead depends on force applied locally near the area of compression. This means the amount of possible drawing force is limited by the tensile strength of the material, a fact that is particularly evident when drawing thin wires.\n\nThe starting point of cold drawing is hot-rolled stock of a suitable size.\n\nThe success of forming is in relation to two things, the flow and stretch of material. As a die forms a shape from a flat sheet of metal, there is a need for the material to move into the shape of the die. The flow of material is controlled through pressure applied to the blank and lubrication applied to the die or the blank. If the form moves too easily, wrinkles will occur in the part. To correct this, more pressure or less lubrication is applied to the blank to limit the flow of material and cause the material to stretch or set thin. If too much pressure is applied, the part will become too thin and break. Drawing metal requires finding the correct balance between wrinkles and breaking to achieve a successful part.\n\nSheet metal drawing becomes \"deep drawing\" when the workpiece is drawing longer than its diameter. It is common that the workpiece is also processed using other forming processes, such as piercing, ironing, necking, rolling, and beading.\nIn \"shallow drawing\", the depth of drawing is less than the smallest dimension of the hole.\n\nBar, tube, and wire drawing all work upon the same principle: the starting stock drawn through a die to reduce the diameter and increase the length. Usually the die is mounted on a draw bench. The end of the workpiece is reduced or pointed to get the end through the die. The end is then placed in grips and the rest of the workpiece is pulled through the die. Steels, copper alloys, and aluminium alloys are common materials that are drawn.\n\nDrawing can also be used to cold-form a shaped cross-section. Cold drawn cross-sections are more precise and have a better surface finish than hot extruded parts. Inexpensive materials can be used instead of expensive alloys for strength requirements, due to work hardening.\n\nBars or rods that are drawn cannot be coiled therefore straight-pull draw benches are used. Chain drives are used to draw workpieces up to . Hydraulic cylinders are used for shorter length workpieces.\n\nThe reduction in area is usually restricted to between 20 and 50%, because greater reductions would exceed the tensile strength of the material, depending on its ductility. To achieve a certain size or shape multiple passes through progressively smaller dies or intermediate anneals may be required.\n\nTube drawing is very similar to bar drawing, except the beginning stock is a tube. It is used to decrease the diameter, improve surface finish and improve dimensional accuracy. A mandrel may or may not be used depending on the specific process used. A floating plug may also be inserted into the inside diameter of the tube to control the wall thickness.\n\nThis technique has long been used to produce flexible metal wire by drawing the material through a series of dies of decreasing size. These dies are manufactured from a number of materials, the most common being tungsten carbide and diamond.\n\n\nSimilar drawing processes are applied in glassblowing and in making glass and plastic optical fiber.\n\nPlastic drawing, sometimes referred to as \"cold drawing\", is the same process as used on metal bars, but applied to plastics.\n\nPlastic drawing is primarily used in manufacturing plastic fibers. The process was discovered by Julian W. Hill (1904–1996) in 1930 while trying to make fibers from an early polyester. It is performed after the material has been \"spun\" into filaments; by extruding the polymer melt through pores of a spinneret. During this process, the individual polymer chains tend to somewhat align because of viscous flow. These filaments still have an amorphous structure, so they are drawn to align the fibers further, thus increasing crystallinity, tensile strength, and stiffness. This is done on a draw twister machine.\n\nFor nylon, the fiber is stretched to four times its spun length. The crystals formed during drawing are held together by hydrogen bonds between the amide hydrogens of one chain and the carbonyl oxygens of another chain.\n\nPolyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheet is drawn in two dimensions to make BoPET (biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate) with improved mechanical properties.\n\n\n"}

They also are working with the port city of Chabahar in Iran's Sistan and Baluchestan Province which is about to the west of Jiwani.\n\nJiwani is located between Gwadar and Chabahar at the eastern end of the Gwadar Bay. The area around the bay includes an important mangrove forest extending across the international border, and is an important habitat for a wide variety of wildlife, especially the endangered Olive Ridley and Green Turtles. Plans to grant fishing concessions and offshore drilling rights are potentially a threat to the wildlife of the area. The population largely depends upon fishing. There are a number of export oriented fish freezing plants located in Jiwani.

{"id": "1850712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850712", "title": "Santa Elena, Ecuador", "text": "Santa Elena, Ecuador\n\nSanta Elena () is a town in southwestern Ecuador, and is the capital of both the province and the canton of the same name. Santa Elena, originally called Sumpa, is located on the Ecuadorian peninsula near the city of Guayaquil. It is regarded as the location of the most important and best documented archaeological site in the country, predominantly due to the discovery of the Lovers of Sumpa.\n\nIn 1977 Olaf Holm, the Director of the Anthropology Museum of the Central Bank of Ecuador, asked Karen E. Stothert to excavate this pre-ceramic site. Stothert and her team found evidence of Las Vegas, the first Ecuadorian culture. Las Vegas flourished from 8800-4600 BC along the Ecuadorian coast. Archaeologists found numerous artifacts and remains of homes and a garbage dump, but the biggest discovery was a cemetery of about 200 people. Among these remains were the bodies of the Lovers of Sumpa, or Los Amantes de Sumpa. They were found buried, and apparently embracing each other. There is much speculation as to why they died, including being stoned to death, but for most of the world it doesn't matter how they died so much as that they died and were buried together.\n\nThe discovery of the cemetery, and the Lovers of Sumpa particularly, brought a significant amount of media attention to Ecuador, which in turn helped emphasize the importance of archaeological research to the understanding of heritage and culture. The Lovers of Sumpa have even been called the Romeo and Juliet of Ecuador, and for this reason have served as a great source of information for sculptors, poets, and musicians all over the world. In general this kind of attention has been beneficial for Ecuador, drawing tourists and doubling the Santa Elena population in 20 years. During these same 20 years there was some controversy and drama about what would happen to the site and the remains. Increased oil prices prevented the country from supplying enough funds to the project to do anything beneficial other than provide guards to protect the important cultural site. Despite the lack of funds for so long, eventually the team was able to secure the site in a way that is safe for the artifacts as well as being beneficial to the cultural knowledge of the people. This effect is, arguably, the most significant consequence of the discovery of this site. Modernization of Ecuador has drawn the rural people away from their lands and their traditions, but this discovery, which prompted an amazing museum as well as cultural and heritage additions to the curriculum of Santa Elena students, ensures the survival of the rich culture of this once thriving people. The Las Vegas people's customs are being preserved.\n\nThe Santa Elena archaeological site is considered a main attraction of the Ecuadorian coast. Because Ecuador has no moral issues preventing the public display of remains, there are three burials on display, protected by glass, and teachers and archaeologists, such as Stothert, use them in teaching as discussion and learning tools. In 1997 when the country was able to provide the proper funds, the Museo Amantes de Sumpa y Centro Cultural was opened to the public. The opening of this museum showed great cooperation between private and public institutions and is home to a variety of Las Vegas artifacts and remains. The site itself is a center for heritage resources and education, which promote the culture of Native coastal Ecuadorians.\n\nStothert, Karen E. \"The New Role of the Ancient Lovers of Sumpa.\" Working Together.

{"id": "1850719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850719", "title": "Controlled vocabulary", "text": "Controlled vocabulary\n\nControlled vocabularies provide a way to organize knowledge for subsequent retrieval. They are used in subject indexing schemes, subject headings, thesauri, taxonomies and other knowledge organization systems. Controlled vocabulary schemes mandate the use of predefined, authorised terms that have been preselected by the designers of the schemes, in contrast to natural language vocabularies, which have no such restriction.\n\nIn library and information science, controlled vocabulary is a carefully selected list of words and phrases, which are used to tag units of information (document or work) so that they may be more easily retrieved by a search. Controlled vocabularies solve the problems of homographs, synonyms and polysemes by a bijection between concepts and authorized terms. In short, controlled vocabularies reduce ambiguity inherent in normal human languages where the same concept can be given different names and ensure consistency.\n\nFor example, in the Library of Congress Subject Headings (a subject heading system that uses a controlled vocabulary), authorized terms—subject headings in this case—have to be chosen to handle choices between variant spellings of the same word (American versus British), choice among scientific and popular terms (\"cockroach\" versus \"Periplaneta americana\"), and choices between synonyms (\"automobile\" versus \"car\"), among other difficult issues.\n\nChoices of authorized terms are based on the principles of \"user warrant\" (what terms users are likely to use), \"literary warrant\" (what terms are generally used in the literature and documents), and \"structural warrant\" (terms chosen by considering the structure, scope of the controlled vocabulary).\n\nControlled vocabularies also typically handle the problem of homographs with qualifiers. For example, the term \"pool\" has to be qualified to refer to either \"swimming pool\" or the game \"pool\" to ensure that each authorized term or heading refers to only one concept.\n\nThere are two main kinds of controlled vocabulary tools used in libraries: subject headings and thesauri. While the differences between the two are diminishing, there are still some minor differences.\n\nHistorically subject headings were designed to describe books in library catalogs by catalogers while thesauri were used by indexers to apply index terms to documents and articles. Subject headings tend to be broader in scope describing whole books, while thesauri tend to be more specialized covering very specific disciplines. Also because of the card catalog system, subject headings tend to have terms that are in indirect order (though with the rise of automated systems this is being removed), while thesaurus terms are always in direct order. Subject headings also tend to use more pre-coordination of terms such that the designer of the controlled vocabulary will combine various concepts together to form one authorized subject heading. (e.g., children and terrorism) while thesauri tend to use singular direct terms. Lastly thesauri list not only equivalent terms but also narrower, broader terms and related terms among various authorized and non-authorized terms, while historically most subject headings did not.\n\nFor example, the Library of Congress Subject Heading itself did not have much syndetic structure until 1943, and it was not until 1985 when it began to adopt the thesauri type term \"Broader term\" and \"Narrow term\".\n\nThe terms are chosen and organized by trained professionals (including librarians and information scientists) who possess expertise in the subject area. Controlled vocabulary terms can accurately describe what a given document is actually about, even if the terms themselves do not occur within the document's text. Well known subject heading systems include the Library of Congress system, MeSH, and Sears. Well known thesauri include the Art and Architecture Thesaurus and the ERIC Thesaurus.\n\nChoosing authorized terms to be used is a tricky business, besides the areas already considered above, the designer has to consider the specificity of the term chosen, whether to use direct entry, inter consistency and stability of the language. Lastly the amount of pre-co-ordinate (in which case the degree of enumeration versus synthesis becomes an issue) and post co-ordinate in the system is another important issue.\n\nControlled vocabulary elements (terms/phrases) employed as tags, to aid in the content identification process of documents, or other information system entities (e.g. DBMS, Web Services) qualifies as metadata.\n\nThere are three main types of indexing languages.\n\n\nWhen indexing a document, the indexer also has to choose the level of indexing exhaustivity, the level of detail in which the document is described. For example, using low indexing exhaustivity, minor aspects of the work will not be described with index terms. In general the higher the indexing exhaustivity, the more terms indexed for each document.\n\nIn recent years free text search as a means of access to documents has become popular. This involves using natural language indexing with an indexing exhaustively set to maximum (every word in the text is \"indexed\"). Many studies have been done to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of free text searches against documents that have been indexed by experts using a few well chosen controlled vocabulary descriptors.\n\nControlled vocabularies are often claimed to improve the accuracy of free text searching, such as to reduce irrelevant items in the retrieval list. These irrelevant items (false positives) are often caused by the inherent ambiguity of natural language. Take the English word \"football\" for example. \"Football\" is the name given to a number of different team sports. Worldwide the most popular of these team sports is association football, which also happens to be called \"soccer\" in several countries. The word \"football\" is also applied to rugby football (rugby union and rugby league), American football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, and Canadian football. A search for \"football\" therefore will retrieve documents that are about several completely different sports. Controlled vocabulary solves this problem by tagging the documents in such a way that the ambiguities are eliminated.\n\nCompared to free text searching, the use of a controlled vocabulary can dramatically increase the performance of an information retrieval system, if performance is measured by precision (the percentage of documents in the retrieval list that are actually relevant to the search topic).\n\nIn some cases controlled vocabulary can enhance recall as well, because unlike natural language schemes, once the correct authorized term is searched, there is no need to search for other terms that might be synonyms of that term.\n\nA controlled vocabulary search may lead to unsatisfactory recall, in that it will fail to retrieve some documents that are actually relevant to the search question.\n\nThis is particularly problematic when the search question involves terms that are sufficiently tangential to the subject area such that the indexer might have decided to tag it using a different term (but the searcher might consider the same). Essentially, this can be avoided only by an experienced user of controlled vocabulary whose understanding of the vocabulary coincides with that of the indexer.\n\nAnother possibility is that the article is just not tagged by the indexer because indexing exhaustivity is low. For example, an article might mention football as a secondary focus, and the indexer might decide not to tag it with \"football\" because it is not important enough compared to the main focus. But it turns out that for the searcher that article is relevant and hence recall fails. A free text search would automatically pick up that article regardless.\n\nOn the other hand, free text searches have high exhaustivity (every word is searched) so although it has much lower precision, it has potential for high recall as long as the searcher overcome the problem of synonyms by entering every combination.\n\nControlled vocabularies may become outdated rapidly in fast developing fields of knowledge, unless the authorized terms are updated regularly. Even in an ideal scenario, a controlled vocabulary is often less specific than the words of the text itself. Indexers trying to choose the appropriate index terms might misinterpret the author, while this precise problem is not a factor in a free text, as it uses the author's own words.\n\nThe use of controlled vocabularies can be costly compared to free text searches because human experts or expensive automated systems are necessary to index each entry. Furthermore, the user has to be familiar with the controlled vocabulary scheme to make best use of the system. But as already mentioned, the control of synonyms, homographs can help increase precision.\n\nNumerous methodologies have been developed to assist in the creation of controlled vocabularies, including faceted classification, which enables a given data record or document to be described in multiple ways.\n\nControlled vocabularies, such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings, are an essential component of bibliography, the study and classification of books. They were initially developed in library and information science. In the 1950s, government agencies began to develop controlled vocabularies for the burgeoning journal literature in specialized fields; an example is the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) developed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Subsequently, for-profit firms (called Abstracting and indexing services) emerged to index the fast-growing literature in every field of knowledge. In the 1960s, an online bibliographic database industry developed based on dialup X.25 networking. These services were seldom made available to the public because they were difficult to use; specialist librarians called search intermediaries handled the searching job. In the 1980s, the first full text databases appeared; these databases contain the full text of the index articles as well as the bibliographic information. Online bibliographic databases have migrated to the Internet and are now publicly available; however, most are proprietary and can be expensive to use. Students enrolled in colleges and universities may be able to access some of these services without charge; some of these services may be accessible without charge at a public library.\n\nIn large organizations, controlled vocabularies may be introduced to improve technical communication. The use of controlled vocabulary ensures that everyone is using the same word to mean the same thing. This consistency of terms is one of the most important concepts in technical writing and knowledge management, where effort is expended to use the same word throughout a document or organization instead of slightly different ones to refer to the same thing.\n\nWeb searching could be dramatically improved by the development of a controlled vocabulary for describing Web pages; the use of such a vocabulary could culminate in a Semantic Web, in which the content of Web pages is described using a machine-readable metadata scheme. One of the first proposals for such a scheme is the Dublin Core Initiative. An example of a controlled vocabulary which is usable for indexing web pages is PSH.\n\nIt is unlikely that a single metadata scheme will ever succeed in describing the content of the entire Web. To create a Semantic Web, it may be necessary to draw from two or more metadata systems to describe a Web page's contents. The eXchangeable Faceted Metadata Language (XFML) is designed to enable controlled vocabulary creators to publish and share metadata systems. XFML is designed on faceted classification principles.\n\nControlled vocabularies of the Semantic Web define the concepts and relationships (terms) used to describe a field of interest or area of concern. For instance, to declare a person in a machine-readable format, a vocabulary is needed that has the formal definition of \"Person\", such as the Friend of a Friend (FOAF) vocabulary, which has a Person class that defines typical properties of a person including, but not limited to, name, honorific prefix, affiliation, email address, and homepage, or the Person vocabulary of Schema.org. Similarly, a book can be described using the Book vocabulary of Schema.org and general publication terms from the Dublin Core vocabulary, an event with the Event vocabulary of Schema.org, and so on.\n\nTo use machine-readable terms from any controlled vocabulary, web designers can choose from a variety of annotation formats, including RDFa, HTML5 Microdata, or JSON-LD in the markup, or RDF serializations (RDF/XML, Turtle, N3, TriG, TriX) in external files.\n\n"}

It is the second of a two-part story, following the broadcast of \"The Empty Child\" on 21 May.\n\nThe episode is set in London in 1941. In the episode, the alien time traveller the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston), his travelling companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), the con man Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), and the homeless woman Nancy (Florence Hoath) investigate a spaceship which crashed the same time patients at a nearby hospital began turning into living dead beings with gas masks for faces.\n\nThe episode saw Jack join the Doctor as a companion. Together with \"The Empty Child\", it won the 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.\n\nThe Ninth Doctor, Rose, and Jack are cornered in a London hospital during the Blitz by patients wearing gas masks fused to their faces asking for their \"mummy\". The Doctor orders them to go back to their room, and the patients shuffle off. Jamie, the index case of the \"epidemic\", also responds to this, leaving his sister Nancy alone. The Doctor, Rose, and Jack investigate the hospital room Jamie was treated at, and learn from recordings that the child is growing stronger with its powers and may become unstoppable. Jamie arrives shortly thereafter, having returned to \"his room\", along with other patients. Jack teleports himself, the Doctor and Rose to Jack's spaceship. The Doctor uses the ship's Chula nanogenes to heal his wounds while learning more about Jack's past.\n\nNancy returns to the site where the cylinder crashed near the hospital on the night Jamie had gained his powers, only to be captured by soldiers. The Doctor, Rose, and Jack return to the site, and discover the guards’ faces transforming into gas mask-wearing people, as the contagion becomes airborne. Examining the cylinder, the remains of a Chula medical ship, the Doctor deduces what has happened: as with Jack's ship, the Chula medical ship carried nanogenes. They had scanned the first human they encountered, Jamie, who died that night, and presumed it was a template for all humans, transforming them into the gas mask-wearing people. Meanwhile, the transformed humans approach the cylinder. The Doctor realises that Jamie is the template controlling all these humans, searching for his \"mummy\", and that Nancy is not Jamie's sister but his mother. The Doctor convinces Nancy to tell Jamie she is Jamie's mother. Nancy accepts Jamie into her arms; the nanogenes gather around the two, determine that Nancy is Jamie's parent and that her DNA is the proper template for humans. The Doctor directs the nanogenes to undo their previous transformations, returning everyone to normal, including restoring Jamie to life.\nA German bomb approaches the site. Jack returns to his ship and uses it to tether the bomb and steer it away from Earth. The Doctor orders everyone to flee the area, setting the Chula medical ship to self-destruct to destroy the technical parts without changing the timeline. Jack is unable to stop the bomb or escape from it, but the Doctor comes to rescue Jack, who joins the Doctor and Rose in the TARDIS. At the end of the episode, the Doctor and Rose dance to 'In the Mood' by Glenn Miller.\n\nIn the DVD commentary for this episode, writer Steven Moffat reveals that up until a very late stage, the nanogenes in this story were called \"nanites\". However, script editor Helen Raynor decided this name sounded too much like similar nanotechnological devices in \"\". Moffat had first used the line \"Life is just nature's way of keeping meat fresh\" in the second series of his 1990s sitcom \"Joking Apart\". He reused it here as he thought it was a good line, but laments that people quote lines from this episode instead of that one. The Chula ships are named after Chula, an Indian/Bangladeshi fusion restaurant in Hammersmith, London where the writers celebrated and discussed their briefs on the scripts they were to write for the season after being commissioned by Russell T Davies.\n\nThe climactic scene of the episode at the alien crash site was filmed on Barry Island, Wales. Several scenes of this story were filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Railway sites at Plymouth Road on Barry Island.\n\nAnachronistically, Jamie's voice is recorded on tape. While compact magnetic tape recorders were developed in Germany in the 1930s, the technology did not make its way to the rest of the world until after World War II. Wire recording was used by the BBC during this period, but recording gramophones, using wax discs as a medium, were more common. Steven Moffat acknowledges this mistake in the DVD commentary for \"The Doctor Dances\", but jokingly suggests that an ancestor of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart stole the machine from Germany to help with the war effort.\n\n\"The Doctor Dances\" received overnight ratings of 6.17 million viewers, a 35.9% audience share; this was the lowest figure yet for the series, but it was during a bank holiday weekend and was the most-watched programme on Saturday. It received a final rating of 6.86 million viewers. The episode received an Audience Appreciation Index score of 85.\n\n\"SFX\" stated that the two-part story had \"everything\", particularly praising Moffat's script. They highlighted the ending of \"The Doctor Dances\" as \"funny, surprising, heartwarming and life-affirming without slipping into syrupy schmaltz\". Dek Hogan of Digital Spy disliked Barrowman as Captain Jack, but named the two-part story as the best episodes of the series. Arnold T Blumburg of \"Now Playing\" gave \"The Doctor Dances\" a grade of A, writing that it \"may be the production and plotting high point of the first series to date\". He said that the episode \"manages to smoothly present a ton of technobabble with clarity and precision\" and praised the dialogue and the \"exhilarating\" climax.\n\nThe scene where the child surprises the Doctor, Rose, and Jack in Room 802 was voted television's \"Golden Moment of 2005\" by viewers, as part of the BBC's \"2005 TV Moments\" programme. In a poll conducted by \"Doctor Who Magazine\" in 2009, the two-part story was ranked the fifth best episode of \"Doctor Who\". \"The Daily Telegraph\" named the story the fourth best of the show in 2008. In 2011 before the second half of the sixth series, \"The Huffington Post\" labelled \"The Empty Child\" and \"The Doctor Dances\" as one of the five essential episodes for new viewers to watch.\n\n\"The Empty Child\" and \"The Doctor Dances\" won the 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form).\n\n"}

The word is derived from the Russian word for \"close,\" \"near,\" meaning \"sitting close to the Tsar.\" \n\nThe duties of first known \"okolnichies\" included arranging the travel and quarters of grand princes and tsars, as well as accommodating foreign ambassadors and presenting them to the court.\n\nInitially their number was very small, but it grew over time and they acquired more duties. An \"okolnichy\" could head a state office (\"prikaz\") or a regiment, could be an ambassador or a member of the state duma.\n\nInitially the rank of \"okolnichy\" was the second highest after that of \"boyar\", while often they performed similar duties. According to the system of \"mestnichestvo\", a person could not be made \"boyar\", unless someone else in his family had recently held a \"boyar\"/\"okolnichy\" rank. Consequently, a position of \"okolnichy\" was a step towards granting the \"boyar\" rank to a non-noble. Even Prince Dmitry Pozharsky, though a Rurikid \"knyaz\" by birth and the \"Saviour of the Motherland\" by royal mercy, could not secure a position higher than \"okolnichy\", because neither his parents nor uncles had ever held a rank higher than \"stolnik\".\n\nUnder the Romanovs, the 18 noblest families of Muscovy were given the privilege of starting their official career from the rank of \"okolnichy\", skipping all the lower ranks, such as \"stolnik\". At the same period, the positions of \"okolnichy\" were differentiated and some of them (\"quarters okolnichy\" or \"close okolnichy\") were of higher rank than that of \"non-close boyars\". The terms derive from a semi-formal ranking based on the proximity to the tsar at the tsar's table.\n"}

{"id": "1850756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850756", "title": "Masters of the Maze", "text": "Masters of the Maze\n\nMasters of the Maze is a children's television game show that aired on the Family Channel from August 29, 1994 to September 15, 1995. After the last episode aired, the show went into reruns until September 22, 1996. The first season was hosted by J. D. Roth, and the second season was hosted by Mario Lopez.\n\nA few years before \"Masters of the Maze\" first aired, Australian Fenton Rosewarne created a puzzle called \"Fenton's Maze,\" which Janet Weeks said \"combined elements of Trivial Pursuit and Rubik's Cube.\" Hal Berger, designer of the Power Glove, through his company IMAGE design and entertainment turned Fenton's Maze into an electronic game, licensed the product to Tiger Electronics, and then sold the game show concept to the Family Channel.\n\nThe show, a two time Emmy-nominated (1995 and 1996) game show for kids, was taped in a 65-by-85 foot studio at CBS Studio Center. The second season consisted of 40 shows, taped five per day. According to co-executive producer Richard Kline, the concept of the show is \"to allow viewers at home to get inside the video game.\" The opening sequence was created by CBS Digital.\n\nN. F. Mendoza, in an article in the \"Los Angeles Times\" printed the day before the show's premiere, referred to defusing a multi-level time bomb, and at one point in the article, referenced the show with the title \"TimeBomb\".\n\nFor the second season, there were 500 prospective contestants vying for 120 contestant spots. The auditions included a 25-question test, a narrative, as well as inhibition-testing events like a tug-of-war, a story-completion exercise, and a blindfolded trip through an obstacle course of folding chairs.\n\nThree two-member teams competed. Each team chose one member to play the question and answer format of the game, while the other went offstage. At this point, the host showed distorted pictures to the players, each of which became more clear as time progressed. The first player to buzz in and identify the picture won ten points and a chance to answer a question about the picture for five additional points. The first two teams to reach 50 points won the right to enter the maze, with the first team doing so earning the right to decide who went into the maze first. After one team reached 50 points, the other teams played out the rest of the round, but without bonus questions. In the speed round, if a player buzzed in and was incorrect or unable to identify the picture, the host read a clue to the opponent without further revealing the picture.\n\nBefore being allowed to enter the maze, the runner was briefed on the maze's layout by the \"Lady of the Maze\". In the Roth season this was simply the face of an older woman (played by Renae Jacobs); in the Lopez season, the likeness of a younger redhead woman appeared with a high-pitched voice (played by Clea Montville). The \"Lady of the Maze\" also appeared again when the runner had reached the halfway point.\n\nIn the earliest episodes, the players were given 10 seconds for each picture, which grew clearer as time passed, and the first person to buzz-in and identify the picture won one point for each second left on the clock, and an opportunity to answer the question about the picture to double the points. When one player earned 50 points or more, and thus the right to enter the maze, the other players played more pictures without the clock, at 10 points per picture, until another player reached 50 points.\n\nThe maze had three sections: the Mirror Maze, the Honeycomb Maze, and the Chamber of Knowledge. The person that answered the questions in the first part of the game was also the one responsible for running through the maze, with their team partner guiding them through the maze by moving a giant joystick. This device controlled a computerized voice telling the contestant which direction to go, and triggered rumble devices on the outfit the runner wore as an additional directional aid. The joystick also had a button that controlled the runner's laser which was used in various parts of the game.\n\nThe first section was called the Mirror Maze. In this section, the contestant navigated a series of mirrors. Once the runner reached the end of the Mirror Maze, the \"Mirror Man\" blocked the path, not moving unless the runner correctly answered a question posed by Roth. A correct answer meant that the runner passed, while an incorrect answer or pass meant that the runner was asked another question. A contestant missing three questions had to wait five more seconds before being allowed to proceed.\n\nOnce the runner had passed the Mirror Maze, the runner had to find two of several Power Sticks that were hidden in the mountains between the Mirror Maze and the Honeycomb Maze. (Occasionally there was a Power Stick hidden in the Mirror Maze itself.) Once the runner found two, they entered the Honeycomb Maze. In this section, the runner had to lower their visor and rely on the partner to guide them through the network of doors and walls.\n\nOnce through the Honeycomb Maze, the runner raised the visor and entered a small briefing room. Here, the Lady of the Maze reappeared to give the runner instructions on what to do inside the Chamber of Knowledge, which the runner entered using one of the two Power Sticks.\n\nInside the Chamber of Knowledge, the runner was asked three different true or false questions by three of the six different guardians. A correct answer caused one of the three gates blocking the way out to open. If the runner answered incorrectly, the same guardian asked another true or false question. If the runner missed this question, one more true or false question was asked. If the runner missed all three, the gate automatically opened after five seconds. Once all three gates were open, the runner exited the chamber (and the maze itself) by inserting his/her remaining power stick into a holder at the finish line to stop the clock.\n\nThe first team set the time that their opponents had to beat. The second team then entered the maze, and had the amount of time established by the first team to make their way through. If the second team ran out of time, an alarm went off, the game ended immediately, and the first team won. If the second team made it out before time ran out, they won the game. The winners of this version also won prizes and the right to play a bonus round.\n\n\nThe quickest team in this version of the show won the right to play a special bonus round, which featured a mountain with five television monitors that constantly altered between a \"Prize\" screen and a \"No Prize\" screen. The runner faced the first TV on the mountain and shouted for the partner to fire the laser. If the team stopped at least three of the five monitors on \"Prize\" (before the team stopped at three monitors on \"No Prize\", which ended the game immediately), they won a $500 shopping spree at The Sharper Image in Beverly Hills.\n\nThe opening game remained the same, but with extra changes. One was that contestants now shot the picture using their laser podium before taking a guess; another was that there was now a special bonus picture at one point in the game in which five bonus points were added to the initial value, making it worth 15 points.\n\nThe maze was extended and featured new obstacles. Its four sections were the Mirror Maze, the Ice Cave, the Chamber of Knowledge, and Lightning Mountain (which consisted of the same set as the first season's Prize Mountain).\n\nThe Mirror Maze remained unchanged. However, the run to find the power stick was removed from this part of the game, and the Mirror Man's question was posed by the Mirror Man himself and his face was larger than last season's. If a contestant gave a wrong answer or ran out of time to answer, another question was read. A runner failing to answer that question correctly had to wait at least three seconds before proceeding.\n\nOnce the runner arrived at the entrance to the Ice Cave, the Lady of The Maze showed the runner a distorted picture on a monitor (as in the first round). A runner identifying it within five seconds took the shorter path through the cave, but otherwise had to take the longer path. In either case, the runner was required to lower the visor before entering the Ice Cave. While navigating the cave, the runner had to find a Power Stick; in addition, the contestant also had to avoid kicking two groups of sensors and Mirror Man placards that were placed on the cave floor. If the runner touched one of these objects, several large icicles descended from the cave ceiling, blocking the runner's path. Upon finding the Power Stick and getting through the Ice Cave, the player lifted their visor and enter the Chamber of Knowledge.\n\nThere were now only four guardians in this portion of the maze, and only one correct answer was required to exit. If the answer was incorrect, the runner had to answer another true or false question, and if the player missed that one, a five-second penalty was assessed before the gates unlocked.\n\nThe runner now faced a single television monitor at the base of Lightning Mountain with faces of the Mirror Man flying on it. The runner had to blast two of these images with his laser before being allowed to run up the mountain and stop the clock. As in the Roth era, the first team set the time, the second team had to beat it, and the second team was not allowed to finish their maze run if their time exceeded the first team's time. The bonus round was removed. The team that won the game automatically won the $500 shopping spree for the runner and the prizes for the navigator.\n\n\nWith both the JD Roth and Mario Lopez seasons, the winning team received a trophy made from one of the power sticks. In addition, the winning runner was said to go on a \"special journey\" in which they appeared to be disintegrated into a ball of randomly spinning particles which floated away into either the large video wall or an inter-dimensional tunnel.\n\nProducer and game show veteran Mark Maxwell-Smith provided the voices of all the Chamber of Knowledge guardians in both seasons, as well as the Mirror Man in the Lopez era.\n\n"}

He received his early education from his father, the Rev Peter Bellinger Brodie; then choosing medicine as his profession he went to London in 1801 and attended the lectures of John Abernethy and attended Charterhouse School. Two years later he became a pupil of Sir Everard Home at St George's Hospital, and in 1808 was appointed assistant surgeon at that institution, on the staff of which he served for over thirty years. In 1810 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, to which in the next four or five years he contributed several papers describing original investigations in physiology. In 1834, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nAt this period he also rapidly obtained a large and lucrative practice and from time to time wrote on surgical questions, contributing numerous papers to the Medical and Chirurgical Society and to the medical journals. His most important work is widely acknowledged to be the 1818 treatise \"Pathological and Surgical Observations on the Diseases of the Joints\", in which he attempts to trace the beginnings of disease in the different tissues that form a joint and to give an exact value to the symptom of pain as evidence of organic disease. This volume led to the adoption by surgeons of more conservative measures in the treatment of diseases of the joints, with consequent reduction in the number of amputations and the saving of many limbs and lives. He also wrote on diseases of the urinary organs and on local nervous affections of a surgical character.\n\nIn 1854 he published anonymously a volume of \"Psychological Inquiries\"—eight years later, the expanded, revised and updated 1862 volume appeared under his name. He received many honours during his career and attended to the health of the Royal Family, starting with George IV. He was also sergeant-surgeon to William IV and Queen Victoria and was made a baronet in 1834. He became a corresponding member of the French Institute in 1844, Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and DCL of Oxford in 1855, president of the Royal Society in 1858 and subsequently, the first president of the General Medical Council.\n\nIn 1858 Henry Gray dedicated his work \"Gray's Anatomy\" to Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie.\n\nSir Benjamin Collins Brodie died of a shoulder tumour in Broome Park, Surrey at the age of 79.

He was the second youngest child of Abel Merrill, Jr. and his wife Abigail. Early in life, he was a committed Whig and churchgoing Protestant, a strong supporter of prohibition and an equally vigorous opponent of the expansion of slavery. After deciding to become a teacher, he moved to the South, but found himself unpopular due to his strong abolitionist views. He returned to New England, tried farming, and then entered the mercantile business. In 1854 he was elected on the abolitionist ticket to the Legislature of New Hampshire.\n\nIn 1856 he decided to leave New England and moved to McGregor, Iowa. Before long, he was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives. In the summer of 1862, Merrill was commissioned Colonel of the 21st Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment, serving in that regiment until seriously wounded in the hip at the Battle of Big Black River Bridge on the Big Black River in May 1863. This was part of the Vicksburg Campaign in 1863, where Union forces captured 1,700 retreating Confederate troops. The battle would mean the Confederate troops were bottled up at Vicksburg, Miss., which was strategically vital. General Ulysses S. Grant, who led that campaign, referred to Merrill's intrepidity as \"eminently brilliant and daring\" and that had Merrill not been a general officer at the time, he would have recommended him for the Medal of Honor. Merrill rejoined his regiment in January 1864, but the lingering effects of his hip wound forced him to terminate his military service the following June.\n\nIn 1867 he was elected Governor of Iowa on the Republican ticket, and served as Governor for two terms, from 1868 to 1872. Merrill's impressive record as a demonstrably civic-minded legislator and patriotic army officer gave him significant political capital in postwar Iowa. In 1867 the state's Republican Party nominated him for governor ahead of the outspoken radical Congressman Josiah B. Grinnell (who had not fought for the Union). Merrill easily won the general election on a platform that pledged support for congressional Reconstruction, local economic development, and the enfranchisement of Iowa's small population of African Americans.\n\nHe proved to be a capable governor during his two terms in office (1868-1872). He labored hard to boost the state's material prosperity by fostering railroad construction and immigration. He lobbied to protect navigation between the Mississippi and the Great Lakes. He supported the public institutions, such as schools, but also sought to improve business methods to reduce the possibilities of corruption and to promote more efficient delivery of services. He also acknowledged the growth of anti-monopoly concerns among farmer by publicly opposing discriminatory freight rates and passenger fares. In regards to the state penitentiary, he prohibited the practice of flogging and urged that a Sunday school should be located in the same building. Under the administration of Gov. Merrill, the movement for the erection of the new (now current) State House was inaugurated.\n\nIn his 1872 farewell address, Governor Merrill said, \"\"While discharging my duty, to be diligent in aiding the development of our State, to labor for the success of our schools and charities...it has been my privilege to realize the intelligence, justice and humanity of our people…[A]s I pass from the one station to the other, permit me to unite with you in dedicating ourselves, our commonwealth, and our country anew to freedom.\"\"\n\nIn 1897 he was injured in a streetcar accident in Los Angeles and never recovered. He died at age 77 and was buried in Des Moines after an imposing funeral ceremony attended by most members of Iowa's political establishment. He was buried with his third wife Elizabeth in a marble tomb in Woodland Cemetery, Des Moines, Iowa. After extensive renovations, a rededication of Governor Merrill's mausoleum is scheduled for Sunday, June 5, 2016.\n\nSamuel Merrill was first married to Catherine Thomas, who died in 1847, fourteen months after their marriage. In January, 1851, he was united in marriage with a Miss Hill, of Buxton, Maine. She became the mother of four children, three of whom died young, the eldest living to be only two and a half years old.\n\n"}

Her husband, James Brady, was press secretary to U.S. president Ronald Reagan and was left permanently disabled as a result of an assassination attempt on Reagan.\n\nShe was born Sarah Jane Kemp in Kirksville, Missouri to L. Stanley Kemp, a high school teacher and later FBI agent, and Frances (née Stufflebean) Kemp, a former teacher and homemaker. She had a younger brother, Bill. She was raised in Alexandria, Virginia, where she graduated from Francis C. Hammond High School in 1959.\n\nShe graduated from the College of William & Mary in 1964. From 1964 to 1968 she was a public school teacher in Virginia. She married James Brady in Alexandria on July 21, 1973. On December 29, 1978, their only child, James \"Scott\" Brady Jr., was born.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1970 she worked as assistant to the campaign director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. She then worked as an administrative aide, first for Mike McKevitt (R-CO) and then for Joseph J. Maraziti (R-NJ). From 1974 to 1978, she worked as director of administration and coordinator of field services for the Republican National Committee.\n\nHer husband sustained a permanently disabling head wound during the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, which occurred on March 30, 1981. James Brady remained as Press Secretary for the remainder of Reagan's administration, primarily in a titular role.\n\nAlongside her husband, Sarah Brady became \"one of the nation's leading crusaders for gun control\". They later became active in the lobbying organization Handgun Control, Inc. that would eventually be renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. She was chairwoman of the Brady Campaign from 2000 until her death in 2015.\n\nIn 1994, she and her husband received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.\n\nSarah Brady died at the age of 73 on April 3, 2015, in Alexandria, Virginia, from pneumonia. Her husband James had died at the same age in the previous year, on August 4, 2014.\n\nIn 2002, Sarah Brady published her autobiography, \"A Good Fight.\" According to \"Library Journal\", it is more about her personal battles and her determination and courage than about gun control.\n\nIn April 2002, Court TV announced a planned television movie adaptation of the book, to be produced in conjunction with Hearst Entertainment. At the book's launch, Bill Clinton praised her for having \"given the gift of life to countless thousands and thousands of Americans\".\n\nThe book gives an \"intimate\" look at her public and personal life, including a \"detailed, suspenseful account\" of the efforts to pass the Brady Bill, according to \"Publishers Weekly\", which suggested that \"fans of [Katharine] Graham's \"Personal History\" may enjoy this story of a determined woman in a male-dominated Washington.\"\n\n\"Kirkus Reviews\" called it \"spirited,\" portraying Brady as a \"scrapper\" who never gives up, despite her husband's injury, her son's medical problems, and her own battle with smoking and lung cancer.\n\n"}
{"id": "1850771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850771", "title": "Modified atmosphere", "text": "Modified atmosphere\n\nModified atmosphere is the practice of modifying the composition of the internal atmosphere of a package (commonly food packages, drugs, etc.) in order to improve the shelf life.The need for this technology for food arises from the short shelf life of food products such as meat, fish, poultry, and dairy in the presence of oxygen. In food, oxygen is readily available for lipid oxidation reactions. Oxygen also helps maintain high respiration rates of fresh produce, which contribute to shortened shelf life. From a microbiological aspect, oxygen encourages the growth of aerobic spoilage microorganisms. Therefore, the reduction of oxygen and its replacement with other gases can reduce or delay oxidation reactions and microbiological spoilage. Oxygen scavengers may also be used to reduce browning due to lipid oxidation by halting the auto-oxidative chemical process.\n\nThe modification process generally lowers the amount of oxygen (O) in the headspace of the package. Oxygen can be replaced with nitrogen (N), a comparatively inert gas, or carbon dioxide (CO).\n\nA stable atmosphere of gases inside the packaging can be achieved using active techniques, such as gas flushing and compensated vacuum, or passively by designing “breathable” films.\n\nThe first recorded beneficial effects of using modified atmosphere date back to 1821. Jacques Etienne Berard, a professor at the School of Pharmacy in Montpellier, France, reported delayed ripening of fruit and increased shelf life in low-oxygen storage conditions. Controlled Atmosphere Storage (CAS) was used from the 1930's when ships transporting fresh apples and pears had high levels of CO in their holding rooms in order to increase the shelf life of the product. In the 1970s MA packages reached the stores when bacon and fish were sold in retail packs in Mexico. Since then development has been continuous and interest in MAP has grown due to consumer demand.\n\nAtmosphere within the package can be modified passively or actively. In passive modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), the high concentration of CO and low O levels in the package is achieved over time as a result of respiration of the product and gas transmission rates of the packaging film. This method is commonly used for fresh respiring fruits and vegetables. Reducing O and increasing CO slows down respiration rate, conserves stored energy, and therefore extended shelf life. On the other hand, active MA involves the use of active systems such as O and CO scavengers or emitters, moisture absorbers, ethylene scavengers, ethanol emitters and gas flushing in the packaging film or container to modify the atmosphere within the package. \n\nThe mixture of gases selected for a MA package depends on the type of product, the packaging materials and the storage temperature. The atmosphere in an MA package consists mainly of adjusted amounts of N, O, and CO Reduction of O promotes delay in deteriorative reactions in foods such as lipid oxidation, browning reactions and growth of spoilage organisms. Low O levels of 3-5% are used to slow down respiration rate in fruits and vegetables. In the case of red meat, however, high levels of O (∼80%) are used to reduce oxidation of myoglobin and maintain an attractive bright red color of the meat. Meat color enhancement is not required for pork, poultry and cooked meats; therefore, a higher concentration of CO is used to extend the shelf life. Levels higher than 10% of CO are phytotoxic for fruit and vegetables, so CO is maintained below this level. N is mostly used as a filler gas to prevent pack collapse. In addition, it is also used to prevent oxidative rancidity in packaged products such as snack foods by displacing atmospheric air, especially oxygen, therefore extending shelf life. The use of noble gases such as Helium (He), Argon (Ar) and Xenon (Xe) to replace N as the balancing gas in MAP can also be used to preserve and extend the shelf life of fresh and minimally processed fruits and vegetables. Their beneficial effects are due to their higher solubility and diffusivity in water, making them more effective in displacing O from cellular sites and enzymatic O receptors. \n\nThere has been a debate regarding the use of carbon monoxide (CO) in the packaging of red meat due to its possible toxic effect on packaging workers. Its use results in a more stable red color of carboxymyoglobin in meat, which leads to another concern that it can mask evidence of spoilage in the product.\n\nLow O and high CO concentrations in packages are effective in limiting the growth of Gram negative bacteria, molds and aerobic microorganisms, such as \"Pseudomonas\" spp. High O combined with high CO could have bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects by suppression of aerobes by high CO and anaerobes by high O. CO has the ability to penetrate bacterial membrane and affect intracellular pH. Therefore, lag phase and generation time of spoilage microorganisms are increased resulting in shelf life extension of refrigerated foods. Since the growth of spoilage microorganisms are suppressed by MAP, the ability of the pathogens to grow is potentially increased. Microorganisms that can survive under low oxygen environment such as \"Campylobacter jejuni\", \"Clostridium botulinum\", \"E. coli\", \"Salmonella\", \"Listeria\" and \"Aeromonas hydophila\" are of major concern for MA packaged products. Products may appear organoleptically acceptable due to the delayed growth of the spoilage microorganisms but might contain harmful pathogens. This risk can be minimized by use of additional hurdles such as temperature control (maintain temperature below 3 degrees C), lowering water activity (less than 0.92), reducing pH (below 4.5) or addition of preservatives such as nitrite to delay metabolic activity and growth of pathogens.\n\nFlexible films are commonly used for products such as fresh produce, meats, fish and bread seeing as they provide suitable permeability for gases and water vapor to reach the desired atmosphere. Pre-formed trays are formed and sent to the food packaging facility where they are filled. The package headspace then undergoes modification and sealing. Pre-formed trays are usually more flexible and allow for a broader range of sizes as opposed to thermoformed packaging materials as different tray sizes and colors can be handled without the risk of damaging the package. Thermoformed packaging however is received in the food packaging facility as a roll of sheets. Each sheet is subjected to heat and pressure, and is formed at the packaging station. Following the forming, the package is filled with the product, and then sealed. The advantages that thermoformed packaging materials have over pre-formed trays are mainly cost-related: thermoformed packaging uses 30% to 50% less material, and they are transported as rolls of material. This will amount in significant reduction of manufacturing and transportation costs.\n\nWhen selecting packaging films for MAP of fruits and vegetables the main characteristics to consider are gas permeability, water vapour transmission rate, mechanical properties, transparency, type of package and sealing reliability. Traditionally used packaging films like LDPE (low-density polyethylene), PVC (polyvinyl chloride), EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) and OPP (oriented polypropylene) are not permeable enough for highly respiring products like fresh-cut produce, mushrooms and broccoli. As fruits and vegetables are respiring products, there is a need to transmit gases through the film. Films designed with these properties are called permeable films. Other films, called barrier films, are designed to prevent the exchange of gases and are mainly used with non-respiring products like meat and fish.\n\nMAP films developed to control the humidity level as well as the gas composition in the sealed package are beneficial for the prolonged storage of fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs that are sensitive to moisture. These films are commonly referred to as modified atmosphere/modified humidity packaging (MA/MH)films.\n\nIn using form-fill-seal packaging machines, the main function is to place the product in a flexible pouch suitable for the desired characteristics of the final product. These pouches can either be pre-formed or thermoformed. The food is introduced into the pouch, the composition of the headspace atmosphere is changed within the package; it is then heat sealed. These types of machines are typically called pillow-wrap, which horizontally or vertically form, fill and seal the product. Form-fill-seal packaging machines are usually used for large scale operations.\n\nIn contrast, chamber machines are used for batch processes. A filled pre-formed wrap is filled with the product and introduced into a cavity. The cavity is closed and vacuum is then pulled on the chamber and the modified atmosphere is inserted as desired. Sealing of the package is done through heated sealing bars, and the product is then removed. This batch process is labor intensive and thus requires a longer period of time; however, it is relatively cheaper than packaging machines which are automated.\n\nAdditionally, snorkel machines are used to modify the atmosphere within a package after the food has been filled. The product is placed in the packaging material and positioned into the machine without the need of a chamber. A nozzle, which is the snorkel, is then inserted into the packaging material. It pulls a vacuum and then flushes the modified atmosphere into the package. The nozzle is removed and the package is heat sealed. This method is suitable for bulk and large operations.\n\nMany products such as red meat, seafood, minimally processed fruits and vegetables, salads, pasta, cheese, bakery goods, poultry, cooked and cured meats, ready meals and dried foods are packaged under MA. A summary of optimal gas mixtures for MA products are shown in the following table.\n\nModified Atmosphere Packaging for different food products and optimal gas mixtures\n\n"}

She is currently signed to WWE and performs as color commentator on the NXT brand. As a wrestler, she is a former WWE Divas Champion, a three-time WWE Women's Champion, and the youngest person alongside The Bella Twins to ever be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nKociański had a successful amateur wrestling career in high school, before being trained by the All Knighters. After her debut in May 2001, she wrestled for numerous independent promotions. She also appeared at the inaugural Shimmer Women Athletes shows. In 2004, she began working for Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), and signed a developmental contract with WWE in October 2005. She debuted on WWE's Raw brand in May 2006, but suffered a legitimate broken jaw the following month. As a result, she had numerous surgeries and returned to OVW for further training. While there, she won the OVW Women's Championship twice, although her second reign is not officially recognized by OVW.\n\nShe returned to the Raw brand in July 2007, and was heavily pushed, dominating the other WWE Divas and gaining the nickname, \"The Glamazon\". She won her first WWE Women's Championship at the No Mercy pay-per-view in October, and held it for six months. She then developed an on-screen relationship with Santino Marella, dubbed \"Glamarella\", and won the Women's Championship for a second time in August 2008, holding it until January 2009. In January 2010, at the Royal Rumble, she became the second woman in the history of the event to enter the men's Royal Rumble match, and went on to win the Women's Championship for the third time in April, holding it for a month. In October 2011, Phoenix won the WWE Divas Championship for the first time and lost it in April 2012. Phoenix retired and left WWE on October 2012 due to creative frustrations with the treatment of women in WWE, and to focus on her family life with boyfriend and later husband Adam Copeland, famous in WWE as Edge, with whom she subsequently had two daughters.\n\nIn 2017, Phoenix returned to WWE upon being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of the 2017 class, also becoming a part-time color commentator for the company; her induction made her the quickest female to be inducted after her retirement and the youngest inductee in history at age 36. In 2019, she also became the first woman to be inducted in the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame, a hall of fame dedicated to professional wrestlers with an amateur background. Phoenix has occasionally wrestled since her return, notably at WrestleMania 35; she also took part in the first-ever women's Royal Rumble match in 2018, making her the first wrestler to have participated in both the men's and women's matches. In May 2019, she was promoted to full-time color commentator on \"NXT\".\n\nElizabeth Kociański was born in Elmira, New York and raised by Polish parents. When she was eleven years old, she won a coloring contest with a prize of tickets to a television taping for the World Wrestling Federation. Kociański credits this as when she fell in love with professional wrestling. She cites Bret Hart, Sgt. Slaughter, Owen Hart, and Ted DiBiase as her favorite wrestlers. Kociański attended Notre Dame High School in Elmira, where she played tennis and ran track. She was voted prom queen in her senior year. Kociański is a graduate from Canisius College in Buffalo, New York with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and Public Relations. While wrestling in OVW, Kociański also worked as a waitress at a local restaurant known to Elmira natives as Lights Bakery and Coffee Shop.\n\nElizabeth Kociański began wrestling on the Notre Dame High School scholastic wrestling team. She was the first female varsity wrestler in the school's history. She became the North-East freestyle women's champion in 1999, and also won at the New York State Fair Tournament the same year. At the time, she was also a member of USA Wrestling, a freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling association. Her life goal was, according to her, to become a professional wrestler, and she believed that having a solid amateur background would help her reach it.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1998, she enrolled in both a professional wrestling school and Canisius College in Buffalo, New York. Her first choice for wrestling school was Stu Hart's Dungeon, but because of the location, she decided on a more local school. At the school, she was trained by the All Knighters (Joey Knight and Robin Knightwing), who themselves had trained in the Hart Dungeon. She later stated that Nora Greenwald, who was known in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as Molly Holly, had paid for her to attend wrestling school after Carolan had given her a demo tape of her work. Her professional wrestling debut match was against Alexis Laree. She then worked for various independent promotions, including Cleveland All Pro Wrestling and Apocalypse Wrestling, against both male and female wrestlers, using the name \"Phoenix\". In 2002, she was one of the first wrestlers in GLORY, an independent organization for women, and was the inaugural champion. She then joined Far North Wrestling (FNW), and was the only female wrestler in the promotion. She defeated Joey Knight and Kevin Grace in 2003 to become the FNW Cruiserweight Champion. Later in 2003 she took part in World Xtreme Wrestling's annual Women's Elite 8 tournament where she made it to the final, before losing to April Hunter. She returned two years later and defeated Nikki Roxx, but was bested in the second round by eventual winner Alicia. The following month, Phoenix appeared at the inaugural taping for the Ring of Honor sister promotion Shimmer Women Athletes; during \"Volume 1\" she was pinned by Shimmer founder Allison Danger but scored an upset victory in a non-title match against NWA Midwest Women's Champion MsChif.\n\nKociański was invited to a tryout with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2004, and then relocated to Louisville, Kentucky to work for their then-developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). She debuted on OVW television in July 2004, having changed her ring name to \"Beth Phoenix\", and became the on-screen girlfriend and valet of Chris Masters. The storyline was short lived, and the following month Phoenix was repackaged as the manager of Aaron \"The Idol\" Stevens. She signed a developmental contract with WWE on October 20, 2005, the same month that she broke her hand. The duo was then joined by Shelly Martinez, who Phoenix soon feuded with in early 2006. Phoenix then stopped appearing regularly on OVW after debuting on WWE's \"Raw\" television show.\n\nAfter sustaining an injury, Phoenix returned to action in OVW on August 16, 2006, defeating Serena. Phoenix began regularly competing for the OVW Women's Championship, unsuccessfully challenging the champion ODB in a battle royal and a four-way match, which was won by Serena. At the October 4 OVW television tapings, however, Phoenix defeated Serena to win the championship. She lost the championship to Victoria Crawford in a gauntlet match on October 20, and won it back the next day; however, Crawford's title reign is not officially recognised, and as a result, neither is Phoenix's second reign. Phoenix officially dropped the championship in a gauntlet match at the November 1 television taping, after she was eliminated by Katie Lea, who eventually won the match.\n\nOn the November 6 episode of OVW, Phoenix came out with her own championship, and claimed to still be the women's champion. As a result, a ladder match was set up, where the winner would become the undisputed OVW Women's Champion. Lea won the match and was presented with the title belt on the first show of 2007. Throughout 2007, Phoenix continued to wrestle in numerous women's matches in OVW. Phoenix made her last appearance in OVW at their August 15 television tapings where she lost to Lea in a number one contenders match.\n\nPhoenix debuted on WWE's main roster on the May 8, 2006, episode of \"Raw\" as a face by attacking Mickie James while James was assaulting Trish Stratus. After this incident, James berated Phoenix for \"ruining everything\" and questioned why she showed up in the first place. A week later, Phoenix was formally introduced by Stratus and then attacked a distracted James on Stratus's behalf. When James finally escaped, Phoenix claimed that James had \"ruined her life\", and would not let her get away with it, before calling her a \"psycho\". On the following episode of \"Raw\", Phoenix attacked James after her match with Torrie Wilson. Then, on the May 29 episode of \"Raw\", Phoenix and Wilson, with Stratus in their corner, teamed together to defeat Candice Michelle and Victoria, who had James in their corner. During the June 5 episode of \"Raw\", Phoenix suffered a legitimately fractured mandible during a match with Victoria, but was able to continue the match, and emerged victorious despite the injury. Phoenix's jaw was entirely severed and subsequent surgeries left a portion of her face permanently numb. She spent a year having surgeries and recovering, including getting a titanium plate and nine screws placed in her jaw, but she was only out of action for two months, as she returned to action in OVW instead of on the main roster.\n\nOn the July 9, 2007, episode of \"Raw\", Phoenix returned as a villain, when Melina claimed to be injured. Phoenix replaced Melina in a tag team match as Jillian Hall's partner, and the two lost to Candice Michelle and Mickie James. At the SummerSlam pay-per-view, Phoenix won the Interpromotional Divas battle royal to become the number one contender for Michelle's WWE Women's Championship. Phoenix was then pushed as a dominating Diva, dubbing herself \"The Glamazon\" and attacking James, Hall, and Michelle on the September 10 episode of \"Raw\". At Unforgiven, however, she failed to capture the Women's Championship from Michelle. Their storyline rivalry continued when Phoenix pinned Michelle during a non-title mixed tag team match on \"Raw\" on September 24.\n\nAt No Mercy in October, Phoenix defeated Michelle to win her first WWE Women's Championship. She retained the title on the October 22 episode of \"Raw\" in a two out of three falls match, in which Candice Michelle was injured by Phoenix shaking the rope, causing her to fall off the top turnbuckle and legitimately break her clavicle.\n\nDuring a 10-Diva tag team match at Survivor Series, Phoenix's team lost after Melina was pinned by Mickie James. On the November 26 episode of \"Raw\", James defeated Melina in a number one contenders match for Phoenix's Women's Championship, setting up a title match between the two at Armageddon, a match in which Phoenix successfully defended her Women's title. On New Year's Eve 2007, Phoenix successfully defended her title in a Triple Threat match against Melina and James, after pinning Melina.\n\nPhoenix, along with then-ally Melina, took part in the \"Playboy\" BunnyMania Lumberjack match at WrestleMania XXIV, where she defeated the team of Ashley and Maria. On April 14, 2008 Phoenix faced Mickie James with her Women's Championship on the line and lost, ending her reign as champion. Phoenix received a rematch on the May 5 episode of \"Raw\" in a lumberjill match, but lost after Melina unintentionally hit her in the face with her boot. On the May 12 episode of \"Raw\", Melina and Phoenix partnered to face Maria and James. During the match, Melina unintentionally knocked Phoenix off of the ring apron, resulting in Phoenix abandoning Melina, which allowed James and Maria to pick up the win. Later that night, Melina and Phoenix brawled in a backstage segment, ending their alliance. At Judgment Day, Phoenix failed to regain the Women's Championship in a Triple Threat match after James pinned Melina to retain the title. At One Night Stand, Phoenix defeated Melina in the first women's \"I Quit\" match in WWE history. The next night on \"Raw\", Phoenix teamed with Katie Lea Burchill to defeat Melina and James in a tag team match. She was pinned by James one week later in a non-title match, and was once again attacked by Melina post-match.\n\nAfter a month absence from television, Phoenix returned on the July 14 episode of \"Raw\", where she defeated Santino Marella after he issued an open challenge to any WWE wrestler backstage. The storyline continued the following week after Marella lost to the returning D-Lo Brown. Phoenix confronted Marella after the match, and they briefly grappled with each other before unexpectedly sharing a kiss, to which both expressed considerable confusion.\n\nThe two then became an on-screen power couple, and the pairing of Phoenix and Marella later became known by the portmanteau Glamarella. Within the team, she acted as the \"straight-woman\" of sorts, berating Marella or reacting in disbelief to his over-the-top, embarrassing antics. At SummerSlam, they defeated Kofi Kingston and Mickie James in an intergender tag team match. Phoenix pinned James, winning the Women's Championship, while Marella won Kingston's Intercontinental Championship. She successfully defended the Women's Championship against Candice Michelle at No Mercy. At Survivor Series in November, Phoenix was team captain of the victorious Raw Diva team which defeated the SmackDown Divas in a five-on-five elimination match; she eliminated Maryse and became the sole survivor of the team.\n\nOn December 8, 2008, Phoenix received the \"Slammy Award\" for Diva of the Year. Phoenix then began feuding with Melina, who had returned from injury in November. This storyline included the debut of Rosa Mendes, who was introduced as Phoenix's \"superfan\". At the Royal Rumble in January 2009, Phoenix lost the Women's Championship to Melina. At WrestleMania XXV, Phoenix competed in the 25-Diva \"Miss WrestleMania\" battle royal; despite scoring 12 eliminations, more than any other participant, she lost when Marella, who competed in drag, claiming to be his twin sister \"Santina\", last eliminated her. After WrestleMania, Glamarella separated, as Phoenix was unhappy with Santino pretending to be \"Santina\". Phoenix had a brief scripted rivalry with both \"Santina\" and Marella, and challenged \"Santina\" for the \"Miss WrestleMania\" title at Backlash, but was unsuccessful.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, Phoenix returned on the July 27 episode of \"Raw\", teaming with Alicia Fox and Rosa Mendes in a losing effort to Mickie James, Gail Kim, and Kelly Kelly. Phoenix had her first opportunity for the WWE Divas Championship, being narrowly defeated by the defending champion, Mickie James, on the August 31 episode of \"Raw\", after winning a number one contender's battle royal that same night.\n\nOn the October 12 episode of \"Raw\", it was announced that Phoenix had been traded to the SmackDown brand. Phoenix made her in-ring debut for the brand on the October 30 episode of \"SmackDown\", defeating Jenny Brooks, an \"enhancement talent\". In January 2010, at the Royal Rumble, she entered the Royal Rumble match and eliminated The Great Khali, before she was eliminated by CM Punk. With her entry, she became the second woman in history to enter the Royal Rumble match, the first being Chyna.\n\nAfter being told by Vickie Guerrero, the SmackDown consultant, that she would not be receiving a Women's Championship opportunity, Phoenix turned face after she saved Tiffany from an attack by Guerrero and LayCool (Michelle McCool and Layla) on the March 12 episode of \"SmackDown\". She then went on to defeat McCool and Layla in a tag team match involving Tiffany. The feud with McCool continued at WrestleMania XXVI, where they were on opposing teams in a 10-Diva tag team match, which Phoenix's team lost, although they won a rematch the following night on \"Raw\". On the April 23 episode of Smackdown, Phoenix teamed with Mickie James to face McCool and Layla. After the match, LayCool beat down Phoenix and smeared make-up on her face and body while she was unconscious. This resulted in Phoenix receiving a match for the Women's Championship against McCool at Extreme Rules, where she defeated McCool in an \"Extreme Makeover\" match to win her third Women's Championship. On the May 6 episode of \"Superstars\", Phoenix tore her ACL in a match against Rosa Mendes, and as a result, one week later on \"SmackDown\", McCool invoked her rematch clause to face Phoenix in a two-on-one handicap match along with Layla, where Layla pinned Phoenix to become the new Women's Champion.\n\nPhoenix returned from her injury at November's Survivor Series pay-per-view, and attacked the former co-Champions Michelle McCool and Layla, after they lost the WWE Divas Championship to Natalya. Phoenix and Natalya then formed an alliance, and at in December, Phoenix and Natalya defeated LayCool in the first Divas Tag Team Tables match in WWE history.\n\nAs part of the 2011 Supplemental Draft on April 26, 2011, Phoenix returned to the Raw brand. On the August 1 episode of \"Raw\", Phoenix won a battle royal to become the number one contender to the WWE Divas Championship, and afterward attacked champion Kelly Kelly to provoke a feud and turning heel in the process. Phoenix later declared that she was tired of the \"perky bimbos\" that comprised the rest of the Divas division, and was on a mission to make a mockery of the other Divas, and was joined by Natalya to form The Divas of Doom. Phoenix went on to unsuccessfully challenge Kelly for the championship at SummerSlam. Throughout September, The Divas of Doom feuded with Kelly and Eve Torres on \"Raw\" and The Chickbusters (AJ and Kaitlyn) on \"SmackDown\". Phoenix challenged Kelly for the Divas Championship again at Night of Champions, but was unsuccessful. At Hell in a Cell in October, Phoenix defeated Kelly to win the Divas Championship for the first time, with help from Natalya. In a rematch on the October 14 episode of \"SmackDown\", Phoenix successfully retained the championship. At Vengeance, Phoenix successfully defended the championship against Eve Torres, with both Natalya and Kelly banned from ringside. Phoenix successfully retained her championship against Torres again at Survivor Series on November 20 in a Lumberjill match, and against Kelly at on December 18.\nFurther successful defenses followed against Torres on the January 30, 2012, episode of \"Raw\" and Tamina Snuka at Elimination Chamber on February 19. After this, Phoenix competed only sporadically for a few months, including a tag team match at WrestleMania XXVIII, where she and Eve Torres were defeated by Kelly Kelly and Maria Menounos. On the April 6 episode of \"SmackDown\", Phoenix lost to Nikki Bella in a non-title match, following Kelly's interference. On the April 23 episode of \"Raw\", Phoenix lost her Divas Championship to Nikki Bella in a Lumberjill match, after suffering a storyline ankle injury. At Extreme Rules, Phoenix was scheduled to face Nikki in a rematch for the Divas Championship, however she was not medically cleared to compete and was replaced by the returning Layla, who ended up winning the title. Phoenix made two unsuccessful attempts at regaining the Divas Championship from Layla at Over the Limit in May and at No Way Out in June, respectively.Phoenix Lost 19 Times Against Divas Champion Layla in Various Live Events. \n\nIn September, Kaitlyn was attacked by an unknown assailant prior to her championship match at Night of Champions. Upon her return, she announced her assailant had blonde hair, and Assistant SmackDown General Manager Eve Torres accused Phoenix before attacking her. On the September 28 episode of \"SmackDown\", after defeating Natalya, Phoenix was suspended by Torres, but the suspension was later reversed by SmackDown General manager Booker T. On the October 1 episode of \"Raw\", Phoenix lost to Torres. Phoenix turned heel again on the October 18 episode of \"Superstars\", when she berated Kaitlyn for thinking that Phoenix attacked her and demanded respect from Kaitlyn, before losing to her in a singles match. On the October 29 episode of \"Raw\", Phoenix was defeated by AJ Lee in a singles match, but the match was restarted by Raw Managing Supervisor Vickie Guerrero, allowing Phoenix to win. After the match, in storyline, Guerrero fired Phoenix for her poor performance. In reality, Phoenix had given her notice to WWE in September and had decided to leave the company; after her departure, she stated that she wanted to focus on her family, but in September 2019, revealed that she had been \"really frustrated with where the women were at from a company standpoint, and the investment that was being made in us. I felt in my heart I had done my best, and I'd try really hard to change things but, at some point I just got really frustrated.\"\n\nOn February 27, 2017, WWE announced that Phoenix would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of the 2017 class. Her induction made her the quickest female to be inducted after her retirement, as she had retired only five years prior, and made her and her husband Edge the first real-life couple to both be inducted.\n\nStarting in 2018, Phoenix became a part-time color commentator for WWE, mainly for women-related events, starting from January 16 to April 3, 2018 for the first season of the \"WWE Mixed Match Challenge\", commenting the tournament each week alongside Michael Cole and Corey Graves. On January 28, 2018 at the Royal Rumble event, she made a one-night wrestling return as a face for the first time since 2012 by entering the first-ever women's Royal Rumble match as a competitor, making her the first person to appear in both a men's and women's Royal Rumble. She entered at number 24 and lasted over two minutes before being eliminated by Natalya.\n\nPhoenix went on to continue to work as a guest commentator at various events and mainly women's matches such as: the WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal at WrestleMania 34, the 2018 Mae Young Classic, the women's Royal Rumble match at the 2019 Royal Rumble event, and the Elimination Chamber match to determine the inaugural WWE Women's Tag Team Champions at the 2019 Elimination Chamber event.\nOn March 10, 2019, at the Fastlane pay-per-view, Phoenix acted as commentator on the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship match between defending champions The Boss 'n' Hug Connection (Bayley and Sasha Banks) and Nia Jax and Tamina. After their defeat, Jax and Tamina attacked Bayley and Banks; Phoenix came to their aid, soon joined by Natalya, but the four were still overpowered by Jax and Tamina. The following day on \"Raw\", Phoenix accompanied Natalya to her match against Jax, eventually causing a disqualification by attacking Jax.\n\nOn the March 18, 2019 episode of \"Raw\", Phoenix announced that she was coming out of retirement; she and Natalya reformed their 2011–2012 tag team The Divas of Doom, and challenged The Boss 'n' Hug Connection for a WWE Women's Tag Team Championship match at WrestleMania 35; however, Tamina ambushed Phoenix after a distraction from Jax during a one-on-one match between Natalya and Banks. On the April 1 episode of \"Raw\", Phoenix wrestled her first match in nearly seven years, where she teamed with Natalya, Bayley and Banks, to face off against Jax, Tamina, and The IIconics (Billie Kay and Peyton Royce), where Phoenix's team emerged victorious after she pinned Royce following a \"Glam Slam\". At WrestleMania, Phoenix and Natalya lost to The IIconics during a fatal four-way tag team match for the Women's Tag Team Championship, when, after Phoenix performed a \"Glam Slam\" from the second rope on defending champion Bayley without realizing that The IIconics' Billie Kay had tagged Phoenix out, was thrown outside the ring by Kay's partner Peyton Royce, who allowed Kay to successfully pin Bayley.\n\nOn May 15, 2019, Phoenix joined the commentary team of \"NXT\" alongside Mauro Ranallo and Nigel McGuinness, replacing Percy Watson; this marked her first time as full-time commentator, and her first time commenting matches that did not involve women. Her first NXT TakeOver as announcer was on June 1, 2019. She was a member of the commenting team when \"NXT\" started airing live on September 18, 2019, and was extended from a 50-minutes runtime to 120 minutes.\n\nPhoenix returned to the ring for the first time since the previous year's WrestleMania during the Women's Royal Rumble match at the 2020 Royal Rumble event, entering at number 19 and lasting over 23 minutes before being eliminated by Shayna Baszler. She sufferred a head injury early in the match when Bianca Belair slapped her chest and caused the back of Phoenix's neck to hit one of the ring posts around the ring, but was able to finish the match.\n\nOn the March 2 episode of \"Raw,\" Phoenix would make an appearance, to provide a medical update on her husband Edge, who was kayfabe injured by Randy Orton. However, Orton would interrupt and explain his actions, which caused Phoenix to slap and kick Orton, who retaliated by hitting her with an RKO.\n\nPhoenix, along with Candice Michelle and Layla El, appeared in the February 2009 issue of \"FLEX Magazine\".\nPhoenix has appeared in 8 WWE video games. She made her in-game debut in \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009\" and appears in \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010\", \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011\", \"WWE 12\", \"WWE 13\", \"WWE 2K18\" (DLC), \"WWE 2K19\" and \"WWE 2K20\".\n\nIn 2001 she was married to Joey Carolan, known by the ring name Joey Knight, but they divorced in 2010.\n\nLater, she began a relationship with Adam Copeland, known in WWE as Edge, and on December 12, 2013 their daughter Lyric Rose Copeland was born. Their second daughter named Ruby Ever Copeland, was born on May 31, 2016. The couple married on October 30, 2016.\n\n\n\n Phoenix lost and regained the championship from Victoria Crawford during her second reign; neither reigns are officially recognized by OVW.\n"}

The company, which is one of the largest hotel chains in the world, owns several hotel brands ranging from upscale to economy. As of March 31, 2019, Choice Hotels franchised 7,005 properties in 41 countries and territories worldwide, with approximately 568,112 rooms.\n\nQuality Courts United, Inc., which began as a nonprofit referral chain of seven motels in Florida, was founded in 1939. It would undergo several name changes before becoming what is known today as Choice Hotels International. The chain initially remained east of the Mississippi River.\n\nBy the early 1960s, Quality Courts United had approximately 600 members. All of its hotels needed to meet certain quality standards and offer amenities like air conditioning, telephones, swimming pools, paved driveways, and wall-to-wall carpeting. In 1963, the organization became a for-profit corporation and changed its name to Quality Courts Motels, Inc.\n\nIn 1957, Stewart W. Bainum Sr., who ran a Washington, D.C., plumbing business, opened his first hotel in Silver Spring, Maryland. He later franchised his first Quality Courts motel in 1963. In 1968, Bainum merged his business, Park Consolidated Motels, Inc., with Quality Courts Motels, assumed the role of president and CEO, and moved the company's headquarters from Daytona Beach to Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\n\"Lodging Magazine\" wrote that, by 1969, Quality Courts Motels was the world's \"largest association of independent motel operators\".\n\nThe company changed its name to Quality Inns International in 1972 and, in 1990, the parent company became known as Choice Hotels International.\n\nIn the 1980s, the company started the industry's first market segmentation strategy, using a range of hotel brands across price points. Geographically, it expanded across the country by opening hotels in the west.\n\nThe Comfort brand, which would later become Choice Hotels' flagship brand, was established in 1981. The brand was marketed to family vacationers, business travelers, and senior citizens to compete with Days Inn, Best Western, and Friendship Inn. The company's Quality Inn hotels remained in the midscale segment, competing with Holiday Inn, Ramada, Howard Johnson, and Travelodge. The now-discontinued Quality Royale brand was positioned as Choice Hotels' upscale brand, designed to compete with Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, and Sheraton. In the 1980s, Choice bought Friendship Inn, Rodeway Inn, and Econo Lodge.\n\nIn 1989, the company introduced McSleep, an economy brand utilizing a consistent, interior-corridor design prototype designed by Rob Spurr that was all new construction. The name was soon changed to Sleep Inn following litigation from McDonald's.\n\nBainum's other business, Manor Care, Inc., which owned and managed nursing homes, bought Choice Hotels in 1990. The company later spun off its hotels business in 1996. Bainum Sr. led Choice Hotels International until 1987, when his son, Stewart W. Bainum Jr., took over the role of chairman and chief executive. As of 2018, Bainum Jr. remains chairman of Choice Hotels.\n\nChoice Hotels International became publicly traded in 1996. That same year, it announced the establishment of the MainStay Suites brand, a midscale extended-stay hotel.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Choice Hotels expanded into the upscale hotel market. The company announced in 2005 the creation of its Cambria Hotels & Suites brand, later renamed Cambria Hotels, the company's first new brand since MainStay Suites's creation in 1996. The Cambria brand was created as an upscale hotel chain marketed to business travelers. , the Cambria brand had expanded to about 100 hotels open or in the pipeline, including hotels in Philadelphia, Dallas, New Orleans, South Windsor, Connecticut and Savannah, Georgia.\n\nIn 2008, Choice Hotels was the first industry chain to establish a \"soft brand\", Ascend Hotel Collection. The Ascend Hotel Collection includes upscale boutique and historic hotels whose owners are subject to fewer fixed brand standards compared with Choice's other brands.\n\nChoice Hotels began a transformation of its Comfort properties in 2012, with the company removing its franchising from 600 properties that did not meet Choice Hotels' new standards. Choice Hotels rebranded Comfort in 2018, which brought its Comfort Inn, Comfort Inn & Suites, and Comfort Suites brands under one umbrella.\n\nIn October 2010, officials in Maryland and Montgomery County announced that Choice Hotels International would move its headquarters from Silver Spring, to a new facility in Rockville Town Center in Rockville. Groundbreaking occurred in August 2011, and Choice Hotels completed the move into the new headquarters in June 2013.\nThroughout its history, Choice Hotels introduced new features into the hotel industry, including having all hotels include non-smoking rooms, 24-hour-a-day toll-free reservations, Internet-based property management systems, and the industry's first iPhone application. The company's technological developments also led it to create a division called SkyTouch Technology in 2013, which markets Choice Hotels' property management system to other hotel companies.\n\nIn 2014, Choice Hotels invested millions of dollars to begin a multi-year process to develop the industry's first new global reservations system and distribution platform in 27 years. A cloud-based system, choiceEDGE, launched in 2018. The system can integrate with voice search and artificial intelligence.\n\nIn 2018, Choice Hotels expanded the number of hotel brands it franchised by acquiring WoodSpring Suites, an extended-stay economy hotel brand. Adding WoodSpring's 240 hotels across the U.S. tripled the number of extended-stay hotels in the company's portfolio to around 350 properties.\n\n, Choice Hotels-branded properties are located in more than 40 countries and territories, including hotels in Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Scandinavia. Choice Hotels entered into an agreement with Spanish hotel operator Sercotel in 2018 to increase Choice's footprint in Spain and Latin America.\n\nChoice Hotels International is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CHH. It maintains a corporate headquarters in Rockville, Maryland, and a technology campus in Phoenix, Arizona. At year-end 2017, Choice Hotels employed 1,987 people in its global corporate operations.\n\nStewart W. Bainum Jr. is chairman of Choice Hotels' board of directors, a position he has held since 1987. Pat Pacious became president and CEO in September 2017. Previously, he served as Choice Hotels' president and chief operating officer.\n\nIn 2017, Choice Hotels teamed up with the Red Cross and Boys and Girls Clubs of America in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma.\n\nChoice Hotels scored 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index in 2018.\n\nThe company's sustainability efforts include Room to be Green, which requires franchised properties to reduce their impact on the environment and lower operating costs with energy-efficient lighting and recycling, and giving guests the option of foregoing daily change of linens. Choice Hotels also participates in Clean the World to recycle hotel soap.\n\nChoice Hotels formed an alliance with Bluegreen Vacations, an international timeshare company, in 2013. Pursuant to this arrangement, many Bluegreen resorts are members of Choice Hotels' Ascend Hotel Collection brand.\n\nChoice Hotels International is the parent company of a number of hotel brands split among various market segments, in addition to a vacation rentals brand. At year-end 2017, Choice Hotels franchised 6,627 properties worldwide, with a total of 525,573 rooms.

His specialty was writing about recent and popular history.\n\nAllen was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He studied at Groton, graduated from Harvard University in 1912 and received his Master's in 1913. He taught at Harvard briefly thereafter before becoming assistant editor of the \"Atlantic Monthly\" in 1914, and then managing editor of \"The Century\" in 1916. He began working for \"Harper's\" in 1923, becoming editor-in-chief in 1941, a position he held until shortly before his death, aged 63, in New York City. His wife, Dorothy Penrose Allen (\"née\" Cobb, a first cousin of Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker), died just prior to the 1931 publication of his best-known book, \"Only Yesterday\".\n\nAllen's popularity coincided with increased interest in history among the book-buying public of the 1920s and 1930s. This interest was met, not by the university-employed historian, but by an amateur historian writing in his free time. Aside from Allen, these historians included Carl Sandburg, Bernard DeVoto, Douglas Southall Freeman, Henry F. Pringle, and Allan Nevins (before his Columbia appointment).\n\nHis most famous book was the enormously popular \"Only Yesterday\" (1931), which chronicled American life in the 1920s. \"Since Yesterday\" (1940), a sort of sequel that covered the Depression of the 1930s, was also a bestseller. The 1933 Hollywood film \"Only Yesterday\" was ostensibly based on his book, but actually used only its timeline, with a fictional plot adapted from a Stefan Zweig novel.\n\nHe wrote the Introduction to Mabel S. Ulrich's collection of essays by notable woman writers of the day, including Mary Borden, Margaret Culkin Banning, Sylvia Townsend Warner, Susan Ertz, E. M. Delafield, Rebecca West, Isabel Paterson and Storm Jameson, \"The More I See Of Men\" (Harper & Brothers, 1932).\n\nHis last and most ambitious book, \"The Big Change\", was a social history of the United States from 1900 to 1950. (He had originally written a Harper's article about how America had changed between 1850 and 1950, but decided to limit the chronological scope of his book.) Allen also wrote two biographies, the first of which was about Paul Revere Reynolds, a literary agent of the era. This work is notable because it contains a chapter about Stephen Crane, but is difficult to find because it was privately published.\n\nIn 1950, Allen was one of five narrators for the RKO Radio Pictures documentary film, \"The Golden Twenties\", produced by Time, Inc..\n\nThe Frederick Lewis Allen Room in the New York Public Library was established by the Ford Foundation in 1958. It is Room 228e on the second floor of the library. Admission is limited to writers under book contract to a publishing company.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1850784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850784", "title": "Tom Dula", "text": "Tom Dula\n\nThomas C. Dula (June 22, 1845 – May 1, 1868) was a former Confederate soldier who was convicted of murdering Laura Foster. National publicity from newspapers such as \"The New York Times\" turned Dula's story into a folk legend. Although Laura was murdered in Wilkes County, North Carolina, Dula was tried, convicted, and hanged in Statesville. Considerable controversy surrounded the case. In subsequent years, a folk song was written (entitled \"Tom Dooley\", based on the pronunciation in the local dialect), and many oral traditions were passed down, regarding the sensational occurrences surrounding Laura Foster's murder and Dula's subsequent execution. The Kingston Trio recorded a hit version of the murder ballad in 1958.\n\nTom Dula was born to a poor Appalachian hill country family in Wilkes County, North Carolina, most likely the youngest of three brothers, with one younger sister, Eliza. Dula grew up, attended school, and \"probably played with the female Fosters\" - Anne (later Melton) and her cousins Laura and Pauline.\n\nAs the children grew up, Tom and Anne apparently became intimate. Anne Foster's mother found Anne and Tom in bed together when Anne was 14 years old and Tom was just 12.\n\nThree months before his 18th birthday, on March 15, 1862, Tom enlisted in the Confederate Army as a private in Company K, 42nd North Carolina Infantry Regiment. He was captured, but he was released in April 1865.\n\nDula wrote a 15-page account of his life, as well as a note that exonerated Anne Melton. His literacy is highly unusual, considering the harsh poverty of his upbringing. Dula played the fiddle and was considered to be a \"ladies man\".\n\nContrary to newspaper accounts at the time, Dula did not serve in Colonel Zebulon Vance's 26th North Carolina Infantry regiment. Also rumors that he \"played the banjo\" in the army band for Vance's benefit and entertained the colonel with his antics were false. These have often been cited as the reason that Vance was so quick to lead the defense during Dula's trial. However, it seems more likely that Vance simply believed in Dula's innocence or felt that defending a veteran in the high-profile case would be politically beneficial.\n\nAlso, Dula did not come through the war completely unscathed, as folklore, oral tradition, and some modern writers have claimed. He was wounded several times in battle. Dula's brothers died in the war, leaving Tom as his mother's \"sole remaining boy\".\n\nDula did sometimes use his musical talents in the army, and on one surviving muster roll he is listed as a \"musician\" and a \"drummer\".\n\nAnne Foster had married an older man, James Melton, who was a farmer, cobbler, and neighbor of both the Fosters and Dulas. Melton also served in the war, taking part in the Battle of Gettysburg. Both Melton and Dula were captured and sent to a northern prison camp. They were released after the war ended and returned home. Shortly after his return, Dula resumed his relationship with Anne. With a reputation as a libertine, it was not long before he began an intimate relationship with Laura Foster, Anne's cousin. Folklore has it that Laura became pregnant, and that she and Dula had decided to elope. On the morning she was to meet Dula, May 25, 1866, Laura quietly left her home and rode off on her father's horse. She was never seen alive again.\n\nNo one really knows what happened that day, but many stories have grown that implicate Anne Melton. Some tales claim that Anne murdered Laura Foster because she was jealous that Dula was marrying her. These stories saw that Dula suspected Anne had killed her, but he still loved Anne enough to take the blame himself. It was Anne's word that led to the discovery of Laura's body, leading to further suspicion of Anne's guilt. Anne's cousin, Pauline Foster, testified that Anne had taken her to the grave one night to make sure it was still well hidden.\n\nWitnesses at the trial testified that Dula made the incriminating statement he was going to \"do in\" the one who gave him \"the pock\" (syphilis). Their testimony suggested that Dula believed Laura had given him syphilis, which he had passed on to Anne. However, the local doctor testified he had treated both Dula and Anne for syphilis with blue mass, as he also had Pauline Foster, who in fact was the first to be treated. Many believe that Dula caught the disease from Pauline Foster, then passed it on to both Anne and Laura.\n\nOnce the grave had been located, Laura Foster's decomposed body was found with her legs drawn up to fit in the shallow grave. She had been stabbed once in the chest. The gruesome murder and the lovers' triangle, combined with the rumors that circulated in the small backwoods town, captured the public's attention and led to the lasting notoriety of the crime.\n\nDula's role in the murder is still debated (though he was eventually found legally culpable). After the murder he stopped at the home of his relative Thomas Dula, a site that became Dula Springs Hotel. He had fled the area before Laura's body was found, after locals accused him of murdering Laura. Calling himself Tom Hall, he worked for about a week for Colonel James Grayson, just across the state line in Trade, Tennessee. Grayson was later mentioned in the song about Dula, and from that came the myth that he had been Dula's rival for the love of Laura Foster, but Grayson actually had no prior connection to either Dula or Foster. Once Dula's identity was known, Grayson did help the Wilkes County posse bring him in, but that was his only part in the affair.\n\nFollowing Dula's arrest, former North Carolina Governor Zebulon Vance represented him \"pro bono\", and to the end of his life maintained that Dula was innocent. He succeeded in having the trial moved from Wilkesboro to Statesville, since it was believed Dula could not receive a fair trial in Wilkes County. Nevertheless, Dula was convicted, and although he was given a new trial on appeal, he was convicted again. His supposed accomplice, Jack Keaton, was set free, and on Dula's word, Anne Melton was acquitted. As he stood on the gallows facing death, Dula reportedly said, \"Gentlemen, do you see this hand? I didn't harm a hair on the girl's head\". He was executed on May 1, 1868, nearly two years after Laura Foster's murder. Dula's younger sister and her husband retrieved his body for burial.\n\nIn 2001, the citizens of North Wilkesboro presented a petition to North Carolina Governor Mike Easley, asking that Tom Dula be posthumously pardoned. No action was taken.\n\nTom Dula was \"acquitted\" of all charges after a petition was sent around Wilkes County and to the county seat. However, this action was unofficial and had no legal standing.\n\nMuch legend and folklore has grown around the tragedy and the life of Tom Dula. Not the least of these is that Dula came through the war without a scratch, with Governor Vance making use of Dula's supposed talents with a banjo for his own entertainment. Both Dula's and Vance's accounts, as well as Dula's own military record, show this to be untrue. Nonetheless, it persists even today.\n\nAnother myth holds that while Dula was fighting in Virginia, Anne — apparently despairing of ever seeing Tom again – met and married an older farmer, James Melton. In fact, Anne had married James Melton in 1859, three years before Tom left for the war, though that may not have changed the nature of her relationship with Dula.\n\nA final tale is that Anne Melton confessed to the murder on her deathbed. Anne allegedly confessed she killed Laura in a fit of jealousy and begged Tom to help her conceal the body. People in the area still say that on her deathbed, Anne saw black cats on the walls and could hear and smell bacon frying.\n\n\n\n"}

It is often used as an erosion control technique on construction sites, as an alternative to the traditional process of broadcasting or sowing dry seed.\n\nThe hydroseeding slurry is transported in a tank, either truck-mounted or trailer-mounted and sprayed over prepared ground. Helicopters have been used to cover larger areas. Aircraft application may also be used on burned wilderness areas after a fire, and in such uses may contain only soil stabilizer to avoid introducing non-native plant species. Hydroseeding is an alternative to the traditional process of broadcasting or sowing dry seed. A study conducted along the lower Colorado River in Arizona reported that hydroseeding could be used to restore riparian vegetation in cleared land.\n\nThe slurry often has other ingredients including fertilizer, tackifying agents, fiber mulch, and green dye.\n\nMaurice Mandell of the Connecticut Highway Department is responsible for coming up with hydroseeding. Back in the 1940s, Mandell was tinkering with ways to grow healthy grass and avoid soil erosion along the slopes of Connecticut’s expressways. He mixed up seed and water then had it sprayed over the slopes where the grass could sprout and take hold, even on a steep incline.\n\nIf planting a relatively large area, hydroseeding can be completed in a very short period of time. It can be very effective for hillsides and sloping lawns to help with erosion control and quick planting. Hydroseeding will typically cost less than planting with sod, but more than broadcast seeding. Results are often quick with high germination rates producing grass growth in about a week and mowing maintenance beginning around 3 to 4 weeks from the date of application. Fiber mulch accelerates the growing process by maintaining moisture around the seeds thereby increasing the rate of germination.\n\n"}

Before his election to Parliament, he worked as a Press Officer at Sellafield, a nuclear fuel reprocessing and nuclear decommissioning site in his constituency, and had served on Copeland Borough Council.\n\nIn his maiden speech Reed declared himself to be a Jedi in the debate over the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill under consideration in Parliament.

In 2010, the population was 80,727, of which 85% lived in the city proper and 15% on the surrounding land. Francisco Beltrão is very close to two other towns, Marmeleiro and Renascença. Its economy is based on agriculture, corn crops, turkey and chicken meat exports, textiles, aluminium pans, mobile industries, public services and small commerce. The mayor in 2008 was Vilmar Reichemback.\n\nFrancisco Beltrão is in the center of the southwest region of Paraná state, which encompasses about 500,000 inhabitants in a 20,000 square kilometer (about 7,700 square mile) area, nearly 5% of the whole state's population and 10% of the entire state's area. Most of the town's surrounding population resides in small agriculture-based villages and towns with only low-level services, leading to them often having to utilize services in the main regional settlement, thus concentrating a large number of the region's economic activities in Francisco Beltrão.\n\nPaulo Abdala Airport serves the city.\n\nFrancisco Beltrão is located in the third parana's highland. The downtown elevation is around 550 meters while the surrounding area rises as high 950 m, causing the city to take on a bowl shape. Several rivers run through this area, the most important being the \"Rio Marrecas\", where the first settlement was established about 1950.\n\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as humid subtropical (Cfa).\n\nThe weather is warm most of the year with occasional hot days in the summer when temperatures reach over in the hottest days. The average high temperature is with lows around . Summer winds are calm, causing the heat index to be high.\n\nThe average winter low is , with temperatures falling below the freezing point for up to ten days per year. With highs around , the winds are a bit stronger than in the summer. During nights of calm wind, the bowl-like shape of the city causes the cold air to descend in the city's center, causing the temperatures to decline much more than in the surrounding areas. However, as soon as the sun rises, this effect quickly vanishes.\n\nThe lowest recorded temperature was in July 2000 at . The highest was in November 1985 at . Snow is rare, appearing once or twice every ten years (the four most recent snows were in July 2007, July 1975, July 1965, and July 1955). Freezes are more common and occur throughout the winter, for up to 20 days a year.\n\nThe average rainfall is high, at around per year.\n\nSince 2000, the GDP has growth over 7.5% annually. Unemployment has dropped from 11% of its 35,000 economically active people to somewhat over 6% as of 2006.\n\nFor the last three years, the city was proportionally ranked first (and generally no lower than fifth) in job-creation throughout the state of Paraná.\n\nMost inhabitants are descendants of Italian and German immigrants, who first lived in the southern states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina before coming to the region between the 1940s and the 1960s. According to some researchers, 50% of population descends from Italian immigrants while 15% are descendants of German immigrants. These proportions are likely to decrease as young people move around Brazil and northern Brazilian residents move to this city.\n"}

Educated at Clare College, Cambridge, he so distinguished himself in mathematics that when only twenty-three years of age he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society. He was elected one of the council in 1716, and in 1723 Sir Isaac Newton, president of the society, appointed him one of the vice-presidents. On the death of Newton he became a candidate for the presidency, but was defeated by Sir Hans Sloane, whom, however, he succeeded in 1741; in 1742 he was made a member of the French Royal Academy of Sciences; in 1746 he received honorary degrees from Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nFolkes was a prominent Freemason, being appointed Deputy Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England during the year 1724–1725.\n\nIn 1733 he set out on a tour through Italy, in the course of which he composed his \"Dissertations on the weights and Values of Ancient Coins\". Before the Society of Antiquaries, of which he was president from 1749 to 1754, he read in 1736 his \"Observations on the Trajan and Antonine Pillars at Rome\" and his \"Table of English Gold Coins from the 18th Year of King Edward III\". In 1745 he printed the latter with another on the history of silver coinage. He also contributed both to the Society of Antiquaries and to the Royal Society other papers, chiefly on Roman antiquities. In 1739 he was elected one of the founding vice-presidents of London's charitable Foundling Hospital for abandoned children, a position he maintained until 1747.\n\nFolkes was married in 1714 to Lucretia Bradshaw, an actress who had appeared at the Haymarket and Drury Lane (see Nichols's \"Lit. Anecdot.\" ii. 5 78-598). His portrait was painted and etched by William Hogarth (1697–1764).\n\nFolkes was a noted atheist, and abhorred racial prejudice. Some of his public statements have been interpreted as evidence of a Darwinian viewpoint. According to the archaeologist William Stukeley, he set up an \"Infidels Club\" in 1720, and caused several young noblemen of the Royal Society to jeer whenever scriptural material was injected into a scientific debate.\n\nFor Sir John Hill's attack on Folkes (\"Review of the Works of the Royal Soc.\", 1751), see Isaac D'Israeli, \"Calamities and Quarrels of Authors\" (1860), pp. 364–366.\n"}

She was acquired by the United States Navy on 25 June 1941, and renamed \"Kitty Hawk\" on 8 July. She was named after Kitty Hawk, North Carolina where the Wright brothers made the world's first powered heavier than air flight on 17 December 1903. She was converted to an aircraft transport by Tietjin & Land Dry Dock Corporation, Hoboken, New Jersey and commissioned on 26 November 1941, at New York Navy Yard, with Commander E. C. Rogers in command.\n\nAfter shakedown, \"Kitty Hawk\" departed New York on 16 December 1941, for Hawaii via the Panama Canal with aircraft to replace U.S. losses in the Japanese attack, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 8 February 1942. She unloaded her aircraft at Hickam Field and returned to the mainland on 25 February. \"Kitty Hawk\" returned to Pearl Harbor on 17 May. Intelligence reports arrived indicating that a Japanese fleet was approaching the Hawaiian Islands. Immediately, \"Kitty Hawk\" loaded the men, armament, and equipment of the 3rd Marine Defense Battalion and aircraft of Marine Air Groups 21 and 45 and sailed at top speed to reinforce Midway, escorted by the destroyer . \"En route\", a PBY Catalina reported a submarine in the area which \"Gwin\" drove off with a heavy barrage of depth charges, enabling \"Kitty Hawk\" to deliver her vital fighting men and aircraft to Midway on 26 May.\nEscorted by destroyers \"Gwin\" and , \"Kitty Hawk\" departed Midway on 29 May and arrived Honolulu on 1 June. On 5 June, she learned of the American victory in the Battle of Midway, which turned back a Japanese offensive with disastrous results to the Japanese carrier attack force. That same day, she sailed for the West Coast, arriving San Diego on 13 June.\n\n\"Kitty Hawk\" returned to Pearl Harbor on 31 July; loaded men, equipment and aircraft of the 2nd Echelon of the 23rd Marine Air Group; and set course for Port Vila, Efate, New Hebrides, arriving on 28 August. She moored alongside the escort carrier transferring 40 aircraft which were immediately catapulted by \"Long Island\" and flown directly into combat on bitterly contested Guadalcanal.\n\nShe sailed on 4 October for San Francisco, discharged and loaded cargo, then headed for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 20 October. Loading badly needed aircraft for the United States Army, she steamed to Palmyra Atoll, arriving on 30 October. There, under hazardous conditions, she embarked more aircraft, cargo and passengers. Sailing on 2 November, she arrived Dumbea Bay, Nouméa on 10 November, where she picked up men from the air group of the fleet carrier after their carrier had been sunk at the battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. Arriving at Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides on 13 November, she discharged army aviators and aircraft. \"Kitty Hawk\" sailed from Espiritu Santo on 22 November for home with 359 passengers, arriving San Diego on 7 December.\n\nCarrying men and equipment of Marine Air Group 12, she got underway on 4 January 1943, for the New Hebrides, arriving at Espiritu Santo on 22 January; but, as enemy air raids prevented unloading, she sailed on to Pallikulo Bay, a safer place; then departed for Undine Bay, Efate, where she finished unloading men, munitions and aircraft of Marine Air Group 12. \"Kitty Hawk\" returned to San Diego on 20 February.\n\nFrom 20 February 1943 – 25 June 1944, \"Kitty Hawk\" made seven voyages to Hawaii and seven to the Southwest Pacific carrying vital aircraft, fighting men and munitions to be used in pressing forward toward Japan.

She also worked as a trainer in WWE's developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling.\n\nAfter debuting in 1998, Hall worked on the independent circuit under the name Macaela Mercedes. She won numerous championships, before beginning to work for Ohio Valley Wrestling in 2003 under her real name. She debuted on WWE's SmackDown brand as the \"fixer\" for the MNM faction. After leaving MNM, she became John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield's \"image consultant\", and managed him to the WWE United States Championship at WrestleMania 22. In February 2007, Hall developed an in-ring persona as a tone-deaf singer. In June 2007, she was drafted to Raw, where she participated in numerous tag team matches after allying with Melina. In October 2009, she won the WWE Divas Championship, but lost it to Melina the same night. Hall was released from her WWE contract in November 2010.\n\nHall was trained by Dave Finlay at his professional wrestling school. Debuting in 1998, Fletcher wrestled under the ring name Macaela Mercedes on the independent circuit as a villainous character. Mercedes won numerous championships on the independent circuit, including Southern States Wrestling's Women's Championship. She wrestled for women-only promotions, including G.L.O.R.Y., the Professional Girl Wrestling Association (PGWA), and the Women's Wrestling Alliance (WWA), and held both the WWA Women's Championship and the PGWA Championship. She also competed for other promotions including Hoosier Pro Wrestling (HPW), where she won both the HPW Cruiserweight Championship and HPW Ladies' Championship, Canadian International Wrestling (CIW), where she won the CIW Indy Women's Championship, Mid–States Championship Wrestling, where she won the MCW Mid-American title, and Blue Water Championship Wrestling, where she won the BWCW Women's title. Her greatest independent circuit success was in the Superstar Wrestling Federation (SWF), where she held the SWF Women's Championship and also competed in numerous intergender matches. She held the SWF Tag Team Championship twice, once with Tiny Tim and once with Randy Allen. In 2002 and early 2003, Mercedes wrestled regularly for the Apocalypse Wrestling Federation and Wrestle And Respect, where she competed in intergender matches and was involved in a scripted rivalry with the \"Fabulous Firebird\" Phoenix over the G.L.O.R.Y. Ladies' Wrestling Championship. On January 23, 2003, Mercedes won the G.L.O.R.Y. Ladies' Wrestling Championship, when she defeated the \"Fabulous Firebird\" Phoenix via referee's decision at an Apocalypse Wrestling Federation show.\n\nIn mid-2003, Fletcher began working for Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). She eventually signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2004. She started out in OVW as a fan favorite—gaining the nickname \"Chronically Cute\"—and had a series of matches against Alexis Laree. After wrestling sporadically throughout 2004, Hall returned in January 2005 as a villain, complete with breast implants, and straightened, bleached blonde hair. The villainous turn was motivated in an angle where her implants \"leaked into her brain\", causing her to become psychotic. As a villain, she managed the OVW Southern Tag Team Champions Blonde Bombers (Tank and Chad Toland) alongside her bodyguard Melissa Coates and went on a spree of blinding people with rubbing alcohol in storyline.\n\nHall made her WWE debut on the July 28, 2005, episode of \"SmackDown!\" with a gimmick of a \"fixer\" for the villainous faction MNM (Joey Mercury, Johnny Nitro, and Melina). She also had a \"growth\" on the left side of her face, which she referred to as a \"blemish\", the nature of which the announcers constantly speculated over. The gimmick carried over to OVW, where the Blonde Bombers forced her to choose between them and MNM. She eventually chose MNM, but did not stay with that group for very long. As MNM's fixer, she, in storyline, helped them to obtain a photo shoot for the cover of \"SmackDown! magazine\", and helped to fix a problem that Melina had with Torrie Wilson, by helping Melina defeat her.\n\nHall was later approached by John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL), a former WWE Champion who asked for help repairing his image after a loss to underdog Rey Mysterio. During this time, she was involved in her first feud on SmackDown!, against Stacy Keibler, with the two confronting each other many times until Hall cheated to defeat Keibler in Keibler's final match on \"Velocity\", one of WWE's secondary television programs. As JBL's \"Image Consultant\", she had an important role in JBL's feud with The Boogeyman, which included The Boogeyman putting worms down her skirt and biting off her mole. She also successfully guided JBL to winning the United States Championship from Chris Benoit at WrestleMania 22 in April.\n\nThat April, he fired her after Hall accidentally slammed a cage door on JBL's head during a steel cage match and put together a \"second-rate\" United States championship celebration. After being fired, she turned into a fan favorite and began a scripted rivalry with former client, Melina of MNM. She defeated her in a six-man tag team match along with Paul London and Brian Kendrick and in singles competition at Judgment Day in a controversial fashion.\n\nThroughout mid-2006, she teamed with Ashley Massaro in a feud against Michelle McCool and Kristal. In July, she participated in a Bra and Panties match at The Great American Bash which was won by Massaro. She appeared only sporadically throughout the end of 2006, competing mainly in dance and lingerie contests.\nIn January 2007, Hall began a scripted rivalry with Massaro centered on Hall's jealousy of Massaro's recent \"Playboy\" appearance; the rivalry turned Hall into a villain and matches between the two mainly resulted in losses for Hall. During the feud, Hall attempted to prove that she was talented in areas beyond wrestling and being eye candy by creating a new in-ring persona, in which she sang badly at every opportunity, but thought she was a very good singer. She later attempted to impress music producer Timbaland by performing a song she claimed to have composed herself, looking for a spot in a video he was preparing and a possible future collaboration on a music project, but he turned her down. Massaro, with whom she had been involved in a rivalry, was one of the wrestlers who was chosen to work with Timbaland instead. Jealous of Massaro's recent successes, she attacked her and, in storyline, seriously injured her, with the reasoning that if she could not appear in Timbaland's music project, neither could Massaro. Following this incident, she had a short rivalry with Michelle McCool, who had come to Massaro's aid, and was annoyed by Hall's singing. She defeated McCool in a singles match on the April 27 episode of \"SmackDown!\", and sang before and after their match. They continued to compete against each other throughout May and June, with McCool coming out on top.\n\nHall was drafted from SmackDown! to the Raw brand on June 17, 2007, as part of the 2007 Supplemental Draft. The following night, Hall won her \"Raw\" debut where she teamed with Melina to defeat Mickie James and Candice Michelle in a tag team match. From then on, Hall mainly competed in tag team matches, wrestling James, Michelle, and Maria. She resumed her singing gimmick not long after, frequently appearing in backstage and in-ring segments, including a stint as one of the contestants for the \"WWE Idol\" segment on the August 13 episode. She also entered into an on-and-off angle with ring announcer Lilian Garcia stemming from her jealousy of Garcia's flourishing singing career. In October, Hall formed an alliance with Melina, and the pair teamed together on numerous occasions throughout the end of the year. She also competed in the 10-wrestler tag team match at Survivor Series, but her team was not successful.\n\nAt the start of 2008, Hall continued her alliance with Melina, both teaming with her and accompanying her to the ring on numerous occasions. Hall was utilized mainly in a backup role throughout the next few months, teaming with Melina, as well as competing in a 12 wrestler tag team match at the Backlash pay-per-view in April, which her team won. In mid-2008, Hall began a scripted rivalry with Mickie James and Kelly Kelly, teaming up with multiple partners, including Layla and Katie Lea Burchill to face them in tag team matches. She continued to have a rivalry with Kelly throughout October, and was also a part of the winning team in a Raw versus SmackDown 10-wrestler tag team elimination match at Survivor Series in November, although she was eliminated by Maria. On the December 29 episode of \"Raw\", Hall competed in a number one contender Divas battle royal for the opportunity to face Beth Phoenix at the Royal Rumble for the Women's Championship, but was eliminated by Mickie James.\n\nIn January 2009, she formed an alliance with the Women's Champion, Beth Phoenix to face Kelly Kelly and former ally Melina in tag team matches, which Phoenix and Hall won due to the interference of Rosa Mendes, Phoenix's associate. She also sporadically competed in singles matches, losing to both Kelly Kelly and Melina. On April 5, at WrestleMania XXV, Hall competed in the 25-Diva battle royal, which was won by \"Santina\" Marella, and continued to compete in tag team matches throughout April and May. Hall then took a brief hiatus and made her return on August 3, teaming with Beth Phoenix to defeat Mickie James and Gail Kim.\n\nOn the October 12 episode of \"Raw\", Hall defeated Mickie James to win the Divas Championship, her first championship in WWE, but lost it to Melina immediately afterwards. This prompted a series of matches between the two. On October 19, Hall unsuccessfully challenged Melina for the title in a rematch. She also teamed with Chavo Guerrero in a losing effort to Melina and Santino Marella in a mixed tag team match, and at Survivor Series, Hall's team was on the losing end of tag team elimination match to Melina's team.\n\nHall competed only sporadically throughout 2010, mainly in tag team matches. On October 2, Hall announced that she was taking a break from television as she had been assigned as a trainer for WWE's developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling. On November 19, 2010, Hall was released from her WWE contract.Hall made a special backstage return at the Raw Reunion\n\nAfter her release from WWE, Hall returned to the independent circuit, competing for promotions including Xtreme Pro Wrestling, World Wrestling Fan Xperience, and Crossfire Wrestling. On June 25, 2011, at \"The Uncensored Rumble IV\" event, Jillian made her Women Superstars Uncensored debut against Kristin Astara in a losing effort. Hall made her debut for Pro Wrestling Xtreme (PWX) on January 28, 2012 at the \"PWX A Wrestling Odyssey\" event, where she defeated Leva Bates to win the vacant PWX Women's Championship. At the \"PWX 1 year Anniversary show\" on April 28, Hall lost the championship to Shooter Storm. Jillian made her debut for Family Wrestling Entertainment (FWE) at the \"FWE Empire State Showdown\" pay-per-view, as a face defeating Jackie Gayda. At the \"FWE Dysfunctional Family\" pay-per-view, Hall defeated Maria Kanellis, with Winter as the special guest referee. Later that night, she teamed with Winter in a losing effort to Kanellis and Rosita.\n\nOn September 27, 2012, Hall wrestled Tara in a tryout dark match for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). On March 17, 2013, Hall returned to TNA to take part in the tapings of the TNA Knockout Knockdown One Night Only pay-per-view, where she was defeated by Velvet Sky. On January 21, 2014, Hall announced her retirement.\n\nHall released her first album \"A Jingle with Jillian\" on December 11, 2007 on iTunes nationwide. The album features five traditional Christmas songs covered by Hall in her character of a terrible singer. The album itself reached number 20 in the UK Holidays Top 100 shortly after its release.\n\nAs a teenager, Hall was a cheerleader and also took gymnastics classes. After graduating from high school, Hall attended college, but dropped out in order to train as a professional wrestler. At nineteen, she legally changed her last name from Fletcher to Hall. She was a fan of Rick Martel.\n\nHall is divorced and has a daughter from the marriage. On September 10, 2010, Hall married Mike Farole in a Las Vegas wedding. Hall announced in February 2011 that the couple was expecting their first child together, but suffered a miscarriage 14 weeks into the pregnancy.\n\nOn April 23, 2012, Hall was arrested in Orange County, Florida and charged with battery. Following her arrest, it was reported that Hall had separated from her husband.\n\nOn March 3, 2020 Hall gave birth to her second daughter, Violet Elise Farrow.\n\n\nwhatculture.com/amp/wwe/former-wwe-diva-jillian-hall-reveals-that-shes-pregnant\n\n"}

He was elected king on 12 March 1959, after a 6 month-rule by a Council of Ministers. In early years, he supported closer links with France, recognising that Wallis was economically dependent on subsidies. After a national referendum, he signed treaty to make Wallis a French overseas territory (\"Territoire d'Outre-Mer\") in 1961.\n\nHe had six children.\n\nIn 2002, the king riled many of his countrymen, as well as France, by shutting down the island's only newspaper because it had carried an editorial criticising him for giving refuge to a family friend, after she was sentenced to jail for embezzling public funds. Reformists also mocked the king's insistence that Wallisians dismount from their bicycles when passing his palace.\n\nIn 2005, the King nearly lost his throne after his grandson, Tomasi Tuugahala, was sentenced to serve 18 months in prison for the involuntary manslaughter of a pedestrian who was killed in a drunk-driving accident on New Year's Eve. The King invited his grandson to take refuge in the royal palace, where he hid for four months before surrendering to the French gendarmes. The King's Prime Minister, holder of the title \"Kalae Kivalu\" urged the high administrator of the French government Xavier de Fürst to \"quit the territory\". The King also claimed that the incident was dealt with according to customary tribal law and that the French penal law should be abolished in Uvea.\n\nReformists wished to depose the King and install Sosefo Mautamakia Ahau Halagahu, son of the late Halagahu as his successor in the northern district \"Hihifo\". Local riots occurred and the coronation did not take place. The King retained the throne and would be further recognised as such by France. Several hundred of the King's supporters marched and built roadblocks on the island during the crisis.\n\nHis daughter Etua took over his ceremonial duties in later years, when he suffered from poor health. He died in Mata-Utu. A six-month mourning period was observed, during which it was taboo to mention a possible successor.\n\n"}

In 1989 he began ten years with the Navy's strategic programs overseeing the submarine inertial navigation and missile programs. In 1992, he became technical director of strategic system programs and, after promotion to rear admiral, was named director, where he served until 1999. Promoted to vice admiral, he served as the commander, Naval Sea Systems Command where he was responsible for design, development and logistics support for all navy ships and shipboard weapons systems until his retirement.

Cox worked as a barrister from 1982 onwards and was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 2003, two years before his election to Parliament. On 9 July 2018, he was appointed Attorney General and gave up private practice; prior to this he had been the highest earning MP in the UK.\n\nCharles Geoffrey Cox was born in Wroughton, Wiltshire on 30 April 1960 to Michael (a Royal Artillery Officer) and Diane Cox. He was educated at King's College, Taunton, an independent school in Somerset. He studied law and classics at Downing College, Cambridge.\n\nCalled to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1982, Cox started practice as a barrister; in 1992 he co-founded Thomas More Chambers, serving as its Head of Chambers. He was appointed Queen's Counsel in 2003.\n\nFor part of his career as a barrister, Cox was Standing Counsel to the government of the Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius. His cases have included \"civil fraud and asset recovery, commercial, human rights, defamation, and judicial review actions\". He has frequently appeared as leading counsel in the Supreme Court or the Privy Council, and he was increasingly instructed to lead in commercial actions and arbitrations overseas, appearing in the DIFC, Mauritius and the Cayman Islands.\n\nHis criminal cases have included the Jubilee line corruption trial; representing Virendra Rastogi the owner of RBG Resources; and successfully defending a member of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment who had been accused of war crimes related to the death of Baha Mousa.\n\nIn 2014, Cox successfully defended the former Premier (and current Speaker of the Legislative Assembly) of the Cayman Islands, McKeeva Bush, on charges of corruption and misuse of office. In March 2015, Cox successfully defended the deputy Editor of \"The Sun\", Geoff Webster, in a trial of four journalists resulting from Operation Elveden. The jury had to decide at what point the behaviour of those on trial could be considered a criminal rather than a serious disciplinary matter; even the lawyers found this difficult to define. Cox subsequently publicly criticised the vagueness of the law, and its disproportionate use that had led to the prosecution.\n\nCox was first selected to stand for Parliament in 2000 by the Torridge and West Devon Conservatives. In the following 2001 general election, he came second to incumbent Liberal Democrat John Burnett by 1,194 votes.\n\nAfter the 2001 election, Cox was reselected. Burnett announced in 2003 that he would not contest the seat again, and at the 2005 general election Cox defeated the new Liberal Democrat candidate, David Walter, gaining a majority of 3,236. Cox made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 28 June 2005.\n\nCox was re-elected as MP for Torridge and West Devon at the 2015 general election with an increased majority of 18,403 votes (32.5%). This majority increased by over 2,000 votes at the 2017 election to 20,686 (34.7%).\n\nIn January 2016, it was reported he had a number of office expense claims for items, such as a 49p pint of milk, rejected by the Commons authorities. He was criticised for this as at the time Cox was Britain's highest-paid MP. In response, Cox said that his staff had been unaware of a recent change in the rules for office expenses, which no longer permitted office hospitality items such as tea, coffee or milk to be claimed.\n\nIn January 2016, Cox was one of 72 MPs who were themselves landlords who derived an income from a property and who backed the Conservative Government in voting down an amendment in Parliament on rental homes being \"fit for human habitation\". The Government argued that the law already provided more effective remedies for tenants to report homes in bad repair to local authorities who then had a statutory duty to inspect them and to take action against the landlord, and that the previous Labour Government had for the same reason rejected the proposal.\n\nIn February 2016, Cox told the House of Commons that he had concluded, after examining the published renegotiation proposals, that the case for leaving the EU was now overwhelming and that he would vote to do so in the forthcoming referendum.\n\nOn 9 July 2018, Cox was appointed to the Cabinet as Her Majesty's Attorney General for England and Wales and Advocate General for Northern Ireland.\n\nIn the House of Commons he has sat on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select committee, the Committee on Standards and the Committee on Privileges. Cox resigned from the latter role in 2016 after registering more than £400,000 of outside earnings within the time limit. \n\nIn the 2019 General Election, Geoffrey Cox was re-elected with 60.1% of the vote and a majority of 24,992 (41.8%).\n\nOn 9 July 2018, Theresa May appointed Cox as Attorney General (the government's top law officer) taking over from Jeremy Wright following a Cabinet reshuffle, prompted by the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson.\n\nOn 1 December 2018, \"The Sunday Times\" newspaper reported the leaked contents of a recent Geoffrey Cox letter to Cabinet Ministers detailing the Attorney General's legal advice on Theresa May's Brexit deal. The newspaper reported that his legal advice declared the Withdrawal agreement's backstop protocol would mean the UK being indefinitely locked into a customs union with the EU if future negotiations collapse and that the only way the UK could leave the Backstop would be the signing of a future trade deal which could take many years to complete. The former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and three serving Cabinet members confirmed the contents of the letter to the \"Sunday Times\".\n\nIn February 2019, Theresa May placed Cox in charge of negotiating changes to the Northern Ireland backstop in the EU withdrawal agreement.\n\nOn 24 September 2019, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled unanimously that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's prorogation of parliament was unlawful overturning the High Court's judgment, given by the Lord Chief Justice, in the government's favour. On the same day, minutes of a conference call between cabinet ministers (which included Cox) were leaked to Sky News. The minutes of the call, which took place after the prorogation had been approved by the Queen, detailed that Cox briefly told the cabinet at that time that in his view the prorogation was lawful and constitutional and that any accusations of unlawfulness \"were motivated by political considerations\". Cox's full advice to the Government has not been published, as per precedent to protect government legal advise being prone to influence. The next day Cox appeared in the House of Commons to answer an urgent question on the Government's legal advice and on the implications of the Supreme Court's decision. Cox rebutted calls for him to resign and criticisms of the Government's position, pointing out that senior and distinguished judges had agreed with the Government's view that the issue was not justiciable and chiding MPs for refusing to agree to a means of the UK leaving the EU while repeatedly preventing the House of Commons from dissolving for an election.\n\nIn February 2020 Cox said the public is concerned about the creeping \"judicialisation of politics\" and said people were right to worry that unelected officials were taking decisions that ought to be taken by Parliament. He promised there would not be radical reforms. He stated his opposition to the highly politicised US selection process of Supreme Court and suggested he preferred the Canadian system. Cox said that \"there's a case for looking at how supreme court judges are appointed... There's a committee of the Canadian parliament that carries out interviews [of candidates].\"\n\nOn 13 February 2020, the \"Financial Times\"s Whitehall correspondent reported that Cox had been sacked as Attorney General.\n\nCox has continued to practise as a Queen's Counsel whilst an MP. According to \"The Daily Telegraph\", based on the declarations in the Register of Members' Interests, Cox's extra-parliamentary work was worth £820,867 in 2014, or 12 times his annual MP salary, whilst the total time on extra-parliamentary work that was registered in 2014 (although the register shows the hours were worked over 3 years) was 1,954 hours. According to the Register as of 2 July 2018], his extra-parliamentary earnings in the 12 months from July 2017 to June 2018 were £487,043; the time expended totalled 1,070 hours, carried out over several years.\n\nCox has previously defended his outside work, pointing out that MPs of all parties have practised as QCs over the years, and that the Attorney General and Solicitor General are normally chosen from their ranks. He has argued that he has always been used to long hours, 70 and 80 hour weeks were quite normal at the Bar, and that the Nolan report concluded that Parliament needed people with current experience of a wide range of professional and other backgrounds.\n\nIn 2016, the House of Commons Standards Committee—of which he was a member—found that he had committed a serious breach of a House of Commons rule, designed to make transparent an MP's financial interests, after failing to register £400k of outside earnings (11 payments) for legal work within the permitted 28-day period. Cox registered the payments late, variously between two and seven months after the deadline; he said that he had omitted to prioritise the rule in the midst of an intense political and professional schedule. When first registering the payments, in September 2015, Cox drew attention to and apologised to the Registrar for his omission, referring himself to the Parliamentary Commissioner, and stepped down from the Committee.\n\nThe Commissioner and the Committee accepted that the payments had not in fact given rise to any conflicts of interest, and that the failure to register the payments within 28 days had thus had no practical effect. Alistair Graham, the former Chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, criticised the lack of punishment and called for a complete reform, while Martin Bell said the Committee on Standards had a long history of inflicting light punishment, which showed that the House was incapable of regulating itself.\n\nOn 9 July 2018, Cox gave up all private practice upon his appointment as Attorney General.\n\nOn 10 December 2019, Danish media claimed that Geoffrey Cox, as a leading barrister and based on his financial interest declaration to Parliament, had earned 380,000 GBP (3.4 million DKK) in legal fees during the years 2015-2017 for representing Sanjay Shah, a Dubai-based British businessman and prime suspect in what is reported to have been the largest tax fraud case Denmark has ever seen. Shah and his legal team asserted that he only exploited legal loopholes which Denmark had failed to close.\n\nPreben Bang Henriksen, chairman of the legal affairs committee of the Danish Parliament, claimed that Geoffrey Cox' engagement for Shah poses a conflict of interest or disqualification issue because the Danish investigation is dependent on British assistance. Henriksen feared that the ties between Shah and Cox \"might discourage British authorities from investigating the case as thoroughly as it evidently needed to be\". A spokesman for Cox rejected that Cox had influenced the investigation in Britain or Denmark, since a system at the Attorney General office would prevent conflicts of interest because Cox would not take part in any decisions within cases where he had previously been involved as a lawyer.\n\nCox lives in rural West Devon, near Tavistock, and London. As with the majority of MPs who do not represent a constituency close to Parliament, he maintains accommodation on expenses in London for when he is working there. He married Jeanie MacDonald in 1985 and they have one daughter and two sons.\n\nIn September 2014, it was reported that Cox was one of a number of individuals investing in the Phoenix Film Partners LLC scheme run by Ingenious PLC which HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) had alleged to be a tax avoidance scheme. Ingenious has contested the allegation and claimed the scheme had been submitted to HMRC for pre-approval and that HMRC had not raised any objections. Cox has said that if the scheme was a tax avoidance scheme, it would have contradicted his instructions to his financial advisers, to whom he specified that he did not wish to be involved in aggressive tax avoidance. Following a string of court victories against the schemes, HM Revenue & Customs has since sought to settle disputes with those involved in the tax avoidance, with an agreed re-payment package. Ingenious PLC were reported to still be disputing the claims.\n\n"}

A locally-built variant of the French Hotchkiss 25mm anti-aircraft gun, it was designed as a dual-purpose weapon for use against armored vehicles and aircraft, but was primarily used as an anti-aircraft gun in fixed mounts with one to three guns.\n\nIn 1935 the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to replace the earlier 40 mm Vickers \"pom-pom\" guns with a 25 mm Hotchkiss design. A party of Japanese officers and engineers traveled to France to evaluate the design in 1935, and an order was placed for a number of guns and mounts for evaluation. Firing tests of these guns were conducted at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in 1935. The first few weapons were built in France under the designation “Type 94” and “Type 95”, with the mass production model produced at the Yokosuka Arsenal being designated “Type 96”.\n\nThe Japanese made a number of minor changes to the original Hotchkiss design and production process, changing some components from forgings to castings to simplify production, and replacing the simple conical flash suppressor with a Rheinmetall-type design. A submarine-mountable version of the gun which made extensive use of stainless steel was also produced.\n\nThe double-mount type was the first to enter service, with triple mounts following in 1941 and finally single mounts later in 1943.\n\nThe Type 96 25mm Gun is a simple air-cooled gas operated design. The barrel is a forging screwed into the breech mechanism. Additional support is provided to the breech end of the gun barrel by the finned cooling jacket. The barrel is changeable, requiring two men and special tools; the operation took a trained crew approximately five minutes. By adjusting the gas valve setting it was possible to vary the rate of fire between 200 and 260 rounds per minute, with 220 rounds per minute being the standard setting.\n\nThe gun mounts were normally provided with one of three gun sights:\n\nLand mountings and all single mountings all used the single open-ring sight. The Type 95 sight was used on ship-based multiple mounts, in the case where the mount has a powered drive linked to a fire director it was used as a backup.\n\nThe Type 95 sight was originally designed with a maximum target speed of 600 kilometers per hour; however, experience showed that aircraft often exceeded this speed. To compensate for the problem, a ring was added to the sighting telescope to provide an additional offset for speeds up to 900 kilometers per hour.\n\nThe gun was normally used without a gun shield, although some multiple mounts on \"Yamato\"-class battleships were fitted with Ducol (High tensile steel) shields. Many ship-based mounts also had splinter shields.\n\nThe Type 96 cartridge case was a rimless type design with a deep extraction groove at the base. The projectiles fired by the weapon were slightly unusual in that they had two rotating bands. The forward band was slightly smaller in diameter than the rear band. It was believed that this was to reduce wear on the rifling near the chamber. The case of the cartridge was crimped around the rear rotating band. The complete round weighed approximately with the projectile weighing .\n\nThe propellant was 102 grams of single-perforated, graphited grains of nitrocellulose approximately 2 millimeters in diameter and between 2.5 and 4.5 millimeters in length.\n\nNormally one tracer round was added every four or five rounds to aid laying.\n\n\nThe Type 96 was the standard Japanese medium anti-aircraft weapon of the Imperial Japanese Navy, being mounted aboard practically every ship in the fleet. The gun was also used in land bases in the Japanese Empire and in the Japanese overseas combat fronts. These weapons were also used as anti-tank guns in some defensive actions in Pacific theaters and against land objectives in southeast Asia/Chinese mainland during the Pacific War. The gun was used by the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War. It was also used by the Bougainville Revolutionary Army during the Bougainville Civil War which lasted from 1988-1998.\n\nIn interviews conducted by the U.S. Naval Technical Mission to Japan after the end of the war, Japanese military personnel said it was the most reliable Japanese anti-aircraft weapon, but second in effectiveness to the Type 98 anti-aircraft gun. The Type 96 was most effective when used at ranges of 1,000 meters or less. The Japanese military estimated that it required an average of 1,500 rounds to shoot down an aircraft at a height of 1,000 meters and a range of 2,000 meters, and that fire beyond that range was completely ineffective. Later in the war, when ammunition supply was restricted, firing was held until the targets were within 800 meters range, dropping this ratio to as low as seven rounds per aircraft.\n\nThe Type 96 was a mediocre weapon compared to its contemporaries in other navies. It was hampered by slow training and elevating speeds (even in power-operated triple mounts), excessive vibration and muzzle flash, and that the ammunition feed was via a 15-round fixed magazine, which necessitated ceasing fire every time the magazine had to be changed. According to \"US Naval Technical Mission to Japan report O-47(N)-2\", all magazines had to be loaded by hand as no specialized loading equipment was ever developed. Overall, it was more comparable to the 20mm Oerlikon, though vastly inferior to the 40mm Bofors weapons used by the US and allies in every respect except rate of fire (and only barely in that respect: the Bofors could put out a sustained 120 round/minute because of its constant-fire top-fed ammo clip design, whereas the 25mm's frequent ammo box changes lowered its nominal rate of fire to only half of its theoretical maximum of 260 rounds per minute).\n\nThe Japanese ranked in order of seriousness the problems with the gun as:\n\nIn \"Rapid Fire\", Anthony Williams writes that the intermediate calibre weapons (including the US Navy's 1.1\"/75 caliber gun 28×199mm L/75) were relatively unsuccessful during World War II: the mounts were much heavier and more complex than smaller calibre guns, but the shells lacked the range and hitting power of the larger 37 and 40 millimeter weapons. The Japanese viewed increasing the caliber of autocannons as the number one priority of research and development in the field.\n\n\n\n"}

After desperate fighting, most of the Australian forces were relieved by October 1941. However, the town was continuously contested until the Allied victory at El Alamein in 1942. The Allied defence of Tobruk lengthened German supply lines and diverted troops who might have been deployed against Allied troops elsewhere. This memorial commemorated the endurance of those who were besieged, who were given the honorific title, \"Rats of Tobruk\".\n\nThe memorial was unveiled on 13 April 1983 by the Governor-General of Australia, Sir Ninian Stephen.\n\nA time capsule was laid at the memorial on 17 April 1991 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the siege of Tobruk, by Mr J.N. Madeley, the Federal President of the \"Rats of Tobruk Association\".\n\nThe replica memorial is based on the 1941 memorial in the Tobruk War Cemetery, built by Australian soldiers during the siege, which has since been destroyed. Incorporated into the memorial is the original inscription stone, the only surviving relic of that memorial, and at one time a front step of the Tobruk Post Office.\n\nThe memorial takes the form of an Obelisk. Surrounding walls portray the perimeter defences; the design recalls the area within which the siege took place; the coastline and harbour are at front, with the defence positions at the rear of the memorial.

It covers the period after the Exodus to around the founding of the Kingdom of Israel. The passage carries the genealogy through Salmon, Boaz, Obed, and Jesse of which only Boaz is notable. It also mentions two women, Rahab and Ruth, both of whom are prominent Old Testament figures. \"For a full discussion of the women mentioned in Matthew's genealogy see \".\n\nWilliam F. Albright and C.S. Mann note that the author of Matthew spells Rahab's name as \"Rachab\", a departure from the Septuagint spelling Matthew usually uses. The \"Rachab\" form also appears in the works of Josephus. They speculate that this indicates a change in pronunciation during this period. Another problem, pointed out by Raymond E. Brown, is that Rahab's position in this verse does not meet other traditions. No other source has her marrying Salmon and giving birth to Boaz. Jewish tradition has her as the wife of Joshua, and thus, also in a different time period.\n\n\n"}

Its success was partly because the original \"Tengai Makyou\" was the first RPG released for the new CD-ROM format, which it utilized to create a bigger game and introduce fully voiced animated cut scenes and CD music to the genre.\n\nThough originally intended to be only three games, it has grown to encompass a number of remakes, gaidens and genre spin-offs across a variety of platforms. Despite its relative popularity in Asian countries, the series is largely unknown in other territories, with only one game released overseas.\n\nThe main series is composed of three separate games within the land of 'Jipang' (a fictional feudal Japan using the name given by Italian merchant Marco Polo), each follows a descendant of the 'Fire Clan' and supporting cast in battles against a range of often comical villains. The stories of the games, though primarily of 'fantasy' fare, are inspired by and a parody of misconceptions about Japanese culture by Western societies.\n\nThe first game \"Tengai Makyo: Ziria\", released for the PC Engine CD-ROM² System in 1989, was notable as the first RPG released on CD-ROM and the first in the genre to feature animated cut scenes and voice acting. The plot and characters were inspired by the Japanese folk tale \"Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari\" (with the protagonist's name deliberately misspelled, per the fantastic theme). The music for the game was also composed by the Academy Award winning musician Ryuichi Sakamoto.\n\nThe game was previewed in the November 1990 issue of \"Computer Gaming World\". The writer Roe R. Adams (also a co-developer for the \"Wizardry\" games) described it as \"a truly gigantic game\" that \"seems to be about the size of 2 or 3 \"Ultimas\" put together.\" He suggested that, if \"NEC can handle the mammoth translating job, \"Ziria\" could be the game hit of 1991\" unless, \"of course, Nintendo counters with \"\" or \"Dragon Warrior III\", and Sega with \"Phantasy Star III\".\" There were also plans to release the sequel \"\" (1992) in North America, but due to the TurboGrafx-16's failure in that market, no \"Tengai Makyou\" games would be released there up until \"\" (1995).\n\nThe games are largely the creation of Hiroshi Adachi (under the nickname \"Oji Hiroi\") and Red Company (today Red Entertainment). Virtually all publishing tasks have been handled by Hudson Soft.\n\nThe series is purported to be based on a book entitled \"Far East of Eden\" written by a Paul Hieronymus Chada (typically written as P.H. Chada), who is presented as a 19th-century Smithsonian professor of oriental studies. The book and P.H. Chada do not exist, and 'P.H. Chada' is actually derived from 'Prince (Ouji) Hiroi Adachi'. This is part of how the setting is supposed based on the misconceptions Western societies held with regard to Japan in the past. \n\nOji Hiroi and Red Company would later become known for creating the \"Sakura Wars\" series for the Sega Saturn.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe series sold over 2.2 million copies.\n\n"}

In order to train effectively for tennis, Coates began weightlifting at 15, and during that same year, she entered her first tennis competition in 1984, where she lasted until the finals. She re-entered the following year and won the Mid-Canada Junior Girls Championship.

After training in OVW, Coates then moved over to Deep South Wrestling and debuted for the territory as The Bag Lady, a homeless woman who became the love interest and eventually the valet of The Freakin' Deacon. On February 22, 2007, the Bag Lady debuted a new Diva-esque look and defeated Angel Williams in their subsequent match. The Bag Lady then began feuding with both Williams and Krissy Vaine. On the April 5 episode of \"DSW TV Tapings\", The Bag Lady accompanied Nattie Neidhart to the ring where she lost to Krissy Vaine after the distraction by Williams followed by Vaine using the heel of a shoe.\n\nIn March 2015, Devon Nicholson described an incident from 2006 that Bill DeMott was involved with while he was head trainer for the WWE's Deep South Wrestling developmental territory. Nicholson described an incident where Drew Hankinson was completely naked in the ring for a long period of time and gave naked stinkfaces to Coates and Zack Ryder while DeMott held jelly donuts over their faces. The wrestlers agreed to do this (with the other talent encouraging them) to get out of regular training for that day. DeMott refuted the notion that it was his idea, stating that the other trainees came up with it because they wanted to skip the session.\n\nIn her first appearances on the indy circuit after leaving DSW, Coates made her debut for Great Championship Wrestling on May 29 and defeated Daffney to win the NWA/GCW Women's Championship, her first professional wrestling championship. Coates continued to remain champion until the title was seemingly forgotten and then deactivated in late 2007. Coates also made several appearances for other Georgia-based wrestling promotions in both a wrestling and managerial role. On July 7, she made her debut for NWA Anarchy as a heel, challenging and defeating several male wrestlers in intergender matches. At NWA Anarchy's Fright Night event, Coates teamed up with fellow DSW alumnus Tony Santarelli to defeat Todd Sexton and referee Wes Grissom, the latter of whom Coates was feuding with.\n\nOn December 15, Coates began an angle with Don Matthews after Coates attacked Matthews and his tag team partner Brodie Chase. All three were then entered into an Anarchy Battle Royal to determine the number one contender for the Television Championship, but both Coates and Matthews were simultaneously eliminated and Matthews began showing affection towards her. On December 29, Matthews publicly declared his affection towards Coates before she struck him in response. The angle between the two continued until Matthews' tag team partner Brodie Chase revealed that he and Coates were together, turning Chase heel in the process. On May 31, 2008, Chase defeated Matthews while having Coates in his corner. While working outside of NWA Anarchy, Coates took on a managerial role in April 2008. Using the ring name Mile High Melissa, Coates adopted a flight attendant gimmick and joined \"Captain\" Mike Flyte, with the pair collectively known as The Flight Crew. In July 2008, they were joined by \"Captain\" Jason Static, though Static left the stable after a few months before Coates left NWA Anarchy.\n\nOn August 23, 2008, Coates made her debut in Women Superstars Uncensored as a villainess and defeated Autumn Breeze in her debut match. Beginning in October, she formed a tag team called the Badass Beauties with Trixxie Lynn. The team made its debut on October 10 in a victory over Annie Social and Rick Cataldo. The following day, the Badass Beauties lost to the Beatdown Betties (Roxxie Cotton and Annie Social) in the first round of a tournament for the vacant Tag Team Championship. After winning a number of singles matches throughout 2009, Coates gained a title match at the WSU Champion Mercedes Martinez April 3, 2010, but was unsuccessful in winning the title. On November 6, Coates wrestled in a six-person gauntlet match for the company's unsanctioned All Guts, No Glory Championship, but was unsuccessful as Angel Orsini, the title's creator and holder, retained the title. Coates left the company shortly after.\n\nOn December 31, 2008, Coates made her Funking Conservatory debut on \"!Bang! TV\" at their Hell's Bells event, where she was unsuccessful in defeating Claudia \"The Claw\" Reiff for the Funking Conservatory Women's Championship. On May 3, 2009, she returned to the promotion for their Hard-Core Brawl event and lost an intergender tag team match with Blain Rage to Reiff and Johnny Romano. On September 5 at Fall Brawl, Coates and Reiff lost to The Wasilla Wrecking Crew (Charlotte Mahoy and Rachael Moore) in a match for the Funking Conservatory Women's Tag Team Championship. At Morbid Power on October 17, she and Reiff defeated The Wasilla Wrecking Crew for the Women's Tag Team Title. Despite being partners, Coates and Reiff wrestled in a three-way match for Reiff's Women's Title that also involved then-champion Rachael Moore at Turkey Shoot on November 21, which Moore won to retain the title. On December 31 at Hell's Bells, Coates competed in a gauntlet match for the Women's Championship, but was unable to win as Reiff reclaimed the title. Following this, Coates left !Bang! at the beginning of 2010, resulting in the Women's Tag Team Title being vacated in the process.\n\nAfter leaving Women Superstars Uncensored, Coates began competing on the independent circuit throughout 2011 before taking a hiatus due to requiring knee surgery. On February 4, 2012, Coates made her debut for the Michigan Championship Wrestling Association in a mixed tag team match, where she teamed with Tyler Elkins to defeat Sybil Starr and Brian Castle. As a result of gaining the pinfall for her team, Coates was granted a match against the Bombshell's Champion Arella Angel. On March 3, Coates defeated Angel to win the Bombshell's Title. Soon after the victory, Coates left the MCWA, leading to the Bomshell's Title being vacated in the process.\n\nOn June 15, 2012, Coates defeated Stacy Shadows to win the Brew City Wrestling Women's Championship, ending Shadows' near two year-long championship reign. Coates would go on to hold the title for over three months before losing it back to Shadows on September 21 in a three-way match also involving Melanie Cruise.\n\nOn November 15, 2014, Coates began managing Sabu, complete with the nickname \"The Super Genie\".\n\nCoates' mother was a nurse and amateur actress and a bodybuilder while her father is a doctor. She is the youngest of four children, having a sister and two brothers. She also earned her Bachelor of Science in biology from Lakehead University, due to originally wanting to become a veterinarian.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He served as the president of Chile between 1876 and 1881.\n\nHe was born in Santiago de Chile, the son of former Chilean president General Francisco Antonio Pinto and of Luisa Garmendia Aldurralde. He completed his studies at the Colegio Argentino de Santiago and the Instituto Nacional. At the age of 20, he joined the foreign service, and was posted as under-secretary to the Chilean Legation to the Holy See. He returned to Chile two years later, in 1850. Two years later, he was elected to the lower house of congress, and was reelected several times. Later, he became a Senator and, in 1861, was named Intendant of Concepción, position that he held for 10 years. There he married Delfina de la Cruz Zañartu, daughter of General José María de la Cruz Prieto and Josefa Zañartu Trujillo.\n\nIn 1871, President Errázuriz named him minister of war and navy, and, from that position, became one of the contenders for the presidential nomination. He first defeated Miguel Luis Amunátegui in the liberal primaries, and later Benjamín Vicuña in the presidential elections.\n\nHis government started under the weight of the worst Chilean economic crisis of the 19th century. This was made worse by the floods of 1876, that laid waste to the nascent infrastructure. An earthquake on May 9, 1877, completed the destruction. At this juncture, he declared the non-convertibility of the currency, a measure that prevented a run on the banks and saved the public credit, but caused him the enmity of the opposition.\n\nIn 1878, he named Viña del Mar as a commune.\n\nNonetheless, the principal crisis of his administration was the outbreak of the War of the Pacific with Peru and Bolivia. He managed to successfully face the first onslaught, at the same time, achieving the all-important Argentinian neutrality. On July 23, 1881, he signed a treaty with Argentina recognising Argentine sovereignty on eastern Patagonia and Eastern Tierra del Fuego but keeping the Strait of Magellan and western Tierra del Fuego under Chilean control.\n\nHe also managed to obtain the capture of Antofagasta and Tarapacá and used these territories as new sources of revenue to finance the rest of the war.\n\nAfter his retirement from politics, a debt that he had personally guaranteed forced him to sell all his property, having to move to a very modest house near Victoria square, in Valparaíso. Though he was offered the position of senator or different embassies in Europe, he decided to make do working as a translator for the railroad companies. He died in Valparaíso in 1884.\n\n"}

Owned by the Newsweb Corporation, the station serves the Chicago metropolitan area. The studios and daytime transmitter are located in the Jefferson Park neighborhood on Chicago's Northwest Side, while the nighttime transmitter resides in Joliet. Besides a standard analog transmission, WCPT's programming is available online.\n\nWCPT is the Chicago affiliate for \"The Stephanie Miller Show\", \"Democracy Now!\", \"The David Pakman Show\", the \"Thom Hartmann Program\" and \"The Rick Ungar Show\"; and is the radio home of Santita Jackson and Joan Esposito.\n\nOn June 23, 1923, the station signed on using the call sign WCBD, broadcasting at 870 kilocycles. The station was located in Zion, Illinois, and was owned by Wilbur Glenn Voliva, who was the \"General Overseer\" of the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church, and was known for his flat Earth beliefs. WCBD was non-commercial, airing religious programming that reflected Voliva's viewpoints, along with vocal and instrumental music. The station originally ran at 500 watts. On February 2, 1925, its power was increased to 5,000 watts. From April 1924 until November 11, 1928, WCBD shared time on its frequency with WLS. In November 1928, its frequency was changed to 1080 kHz, where it shared time with WMBI. Both WCBD and WMBI were restricted to daytime operations to protect WBT in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nIn 1934, WCBD's studios were moved to the Karcher Hotel in Waukegan, Illinois and Gene T. Dyer was appointed station director. The station began to air some Italian language programming. In 1936, the station was sold to Gene T. Dyer and its studios were moved to the Guyon Paradise Ballroom in Chicago. It became a commercial operation, and aired religious, ethnic, and music programming. On April 2, 1937, the station's transmitter and the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church's Shiloh Tabernacle were destroyed in a fire set by a teenager who believed Voliva had swindled his father. Its transmitter site was relocated to Addison Township, in what today is part of Elmhurst, Illinois, and its studios were moved to 2400 W. Madison in Chicago. WCBD shared WMBI's transmitter while its new transmitter was being built.\n\nIn 1940, Voliva filed suit against WCBD, alleging that the station's insistence that he provide scripts of speeches violated the terms of his contract, which allowed him to speak on the station without censorship. Dyer stated that the requirement was necessary because Voliva had violated his promise not to air his political views. WCBD's frequency was changed to 1110 kHz in March 1941, as a result of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement.\n\nIn June 1941, the station's frequency was changed to 820 kHz. It ran 5,000 watts, signing off at sunset in Dallas to protect WBAP in Fort Worth. The call sign was changed to WAIT on September 15, 1941. In 1947, the station began sharing time with a new WCBD, owned by the Christian Catholic Church in Zion, Illinois, which operated on Sundays only. In 1959, WAIT's owners purchased WCBD for $132,000, and WAIT was granted full daytime operations on the frequency. Daddy-O Daylie began his radio career on WAIT in 1948, hosting a jazz program. Daylie remained on the station until 1956, when he began hosting a nighttime show on 670 WMAQ.\n\nIn 1951, the station's studios were moved to its transmitter site in Elmhurst. In 1954, it was sold to Robert Oscar Miller and family. Nelson Eddy, the Wayne King Orchestra, Liberace, \"Coke Time with Eddie Fisher\", and \"The Hour of Charm\" were heard on WAIT in the 1950s. In the mid-1950s, WAIT published a chart of the top 20 popular songs in Chicago. Reed Farrell and Lloyd 'Spider' Webb were DJs on the station during this period. In 1957, the station's studios were moved to the Steuben Club Building. In 1963, its studios were moved back to its transmitter site in Elmhurst, though its offices remained in the Steuben Club Building.\n\nIn 1962, the station was sold to a partnership led by Maurice and Lois Rosenfield, for $1 million. It adopted a beautiful music format in early 1963, which it continued to air through the 1970s. It was branded \"The World's Most Beautiful Music\" and used the slogan \"try a little tenderness\". Personalities heard on WAIT during this era included Ken Alexander, Dick Buckley, and John Doremus. In 1967, the station applied to the Federal Communications Commission for a waiver of its clear-channel rules so that it could operate at night. When the FCC denied its application, it appealed to the D.C. Court of Appeals, which upheld the FCC's decision.\n\nIn autumn 1976, the station shifted to an adult contemporary format. In October 1977, WAIT switched to a talk format. However, its ratings dropped considerably after it abandoned the beautiful music format, and in August 1978 it returned to the beautiful music format it had long aired. In 1979, the station's license was assigned to Century Chicago Broadcasting, a partnership of Century Broadcasting Corporation and the station's previous owners. In 1980, it applied to the FCC for a construction permit to add nighttime operations at 1,000 watts. The permit was granted in 1981, and it began nighttime operations by 1982. In 1981, the station started carrying Northwestern Wildcats football games.\n\nIn October 1982, WAIT began airing an adult standards format branded \"Great Hits\", featuring the hits of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The station aired \"Chuck Schaden's Radio Theatre\" weekday evenings. Eddie Hubbard joined WAIT in 1983, and hosted the morning drive show. Dick Buckley hosted a jazz program Saturday nights from 1984 to 1985.\n\nOn April 7, 1986, the station began airing a soft adult contemporary format as \"Cozy\" WCZE. Gary Parks hosted morning drive, while the rest of its programming was delivered by satellite from Transtar Radio Networks' \"Format 41\" service. In April 1988, its call sign was changed to WXEZ, standing for \"Extra Easy\", and it became a simulcast of WXEZ-FM, airing easy listening music. In 1989, it shifted back to a soft AC format, playing more vocals and fewer instrumentals. On November 16, 1990, the station's call sign was changed to WPNT, and it briefly aired a hot AC format branded \"The Point,\" simulcasting WPNT-FM. In early January 1991, the station was taken off the air, as its owner disposed of its transmitter site in Elmhurst, Illinois.\n\nIn late 1991, the station was sold to Diamond Broadcasting. At 7:15 a.m. on January 2, 1992, it returned to the air from a new site in Chicago's Cragin neighborhood, though without nighttime operations. It became WSCR \"The Score,\" the first all-sports station in Chicago. The Score's original hosts included Tom Shaer, Dan Jiggetts partnered with Mike North, and Dan McNeil. McNeil would later be partnered with Terry Boers. Former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka hosted a weekly show in 1992, and served as an analyst during football season until 1997, when he was hired to coach the New Orleans Saints. WSCR carried Illinois Fighting Illini basketball in the 1993/1994 season, but their status as a daytimer limited the number of games they could air. Night games instead aired on 92.7 WCBR-FM.\n\nOn November 10, 1994, WSCR was granted a construction permit to broadcast at night, running 1,200 watts from a site in Lemont, Illinois. In 1995, the station was sold to Westinghouse (Group W), along with WXRT, for $60 million. Westinghouse decided against building the nighttime transmitter site in Lemont, and instead made plans to move \"The Score\" to 1160 AM. The construction permit to add nighttime operations was cancelled. On April 7, 1997, at 2:30 p.m., \"The Score\" moved to 1160 AM, along with the WSCR call letters.\n\nIn early 1997, the station was sold to N. John Douglas's Personal Achievement Radio, Inc. for $7.5 million. On April 7, 1997, it began airing a motivational talk format as \"Personal Achievement Radio\", and its call sign was changed to WYPA. Its programming was presented in short segments, less than ten minutes long, and included material culled from the libraries of self-help publishers featuring speakers such as Tony Robbins, as well as locally produced segments featuring Wayne Messmer and Mary Laney. Weekends featured longer shows, with local hosts such as Les Brown, as well as brokered programming.\n\nOn June 9, 1998, \"Personal Achievement Radio\" moved to WNDZ, and WYPA adopted a Spanish language talk format as an affiliate of \"Radio Unica.\" Personalities heard on Radio Unica included Pedro Sevcec, Isabel Gómez-Bassols, among others. In 1998, the station's owner, Achievement Radio Holdings, merged with Z-Spanish Media. On May 15, 1999, Radio Unica moved to 950 WNTD, though it continued to simulcast on WYPA.\n\nIn mid-1999, the station was purchased by Catholic Family Radio for $10.5 million, and on June 9 it began airing a Catholic talk format. Hosts included Ray Guarendi, Raymond Flynn, Dan Lungren, and Al Kresta. In April 2000, Catholic Family Radio placed all of its radio stations up for sale, and on May 29, most of Catholic Family Radio's programming was replaced by EWTN Radio, with Al Kresta's show being the only Catholic Family Radio show remaining on the station.\n\nIn early 2001, WYPA was purchased by Newsweb for $10.5 million. On March 1, 2001, One on One Sports (now known as SB Nation Radio) moved its programming from WJKL to WYPA, and the station adopted a sports format. On March 26, 2001, One-on-One Sports' name was changed to Sporting News Radio, and the station's call sign was changed to WCSN. Personalities heard on the station included Jay Mariotti, Chet Coppock, Phil Jackson, Chet Coppock, and Bruce Murray.\n\nIn April 2003, Starboard Broadcasting began leasing two hours of airtime a day to air the Relevant Radio Catholic network. On December 1, 2003, it began leasing the entire day. On May 3, 2005, the station's call letters were changed back to WAIT when Newsweb's WAIT (850 AM) launched a progressive talk format with the new call letters WCPT. Newsweb's owner, Fred Eychaner, is a significant donor to Democratic Party causes. Later that year, the station's city of license was changed from Chicago to Willow Springs. In October 2007, Relevant Radio moved to WNTD, though it continued to simulcast on WAIT until November 25.\n\nOn November 26, 2007, Chicago's Progressive Talk moved from 850 AM to 820 AM, doubling its power and providing coverage to all of the Chicago metropolitan area. The WCPT call letters moved along with the format to 820 AM, and the WAIT call letters returned to 850 AM. Hosts included Ed Schultz, Stephanie Miller, Randi Rhodes, Thom Hartmann, Bill Press, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. On March 29, 2008, Jake Hartford joined WCPT, hosting Saturday mornings. On May 19, 2008, WCPT began airing \"The Rachel Maddow Show\", and in January 2010 the station began airing \"The Norman Goldman Show\".\n\nIn late October 2008, the station started simulcasting on 92.7 WCPT-FM in Arlington Heights, 92.5 WCPY in DeKalb, and 99.9 WCPQ in Park Forest. On March 19, 2009, WCPT and WIND hosted \"The Great Debate\", featuring Thom Hartmann representing the liberal viewpoint and Michael Medved representing the conservative viewpoint, and moderated by Cisco Cotto and Dick Kay. On April 29, 2010, WCPT began broadcasting 24 hours a day, although it reduces power to 1,500 watts after sunset so not to interfere with WBAP in Fort Worth. On June 2, 2014, WCPT-FM and WCPQ broke away from the simulcast, and 92.5 in DeKalb took the WCPT-FM call sign. In 2016, WCPT's daytime power was increased to 5,800 watts, and its daytime transmitter was moved to Chicago's Jefferson Park neighborhood. In 2018, WCPT-FM was sold to Educational Media Foundation and became an affiliate of K-Love, a Christian contemporary music network.\n\nJoan Esposito joined WCPT as weekday afternoon host on February 11, 2019. In late February 2019, the station began carrying \"The Rick Ungar Show\". Santita Jackson joined WCPT as morning drive host on June 3, 2019.\n"}

Species belonging to the Phacopina lived from the Lower Ordovician (Tremadocian) through the end of the Upper Devonian (Famennian). The one unique feature that distinguishes Phacopina from all other trilobites are the very large, separately set lenses without a common cornea of the compound eye.\n\nAs far as known, all Phacopina species were marine bottom-dwellers.\n\nThe Early Ordovician genus \"Gyrometopus\" (superfamily Dalmanitoidea, family Diaphanometopidae) is probably close to the common ancestor of the Phacopina. \"Gyrometopus\" is phacopid in appearance, but a rostral plate is present, unlike in other Phacopina. However, the rostral plate does not divide the cephalic doublure into a left and right section, but instead the rostral suture defines a semicircle in the frontal ¾ of the doublure.\n\nThe eyes (if present) consist of very large (0.07mm in \"Tricopelta breviceps\" to 0.5mm in \"Phacops rana\"), separately set lenses without a common cornea (so called schizochroal eyes). However, some Phacopina species lack eyes, such as the species of the genus \"Ductina\". The natural fracture lines (sutures) of the head run along the top edges of the compound eye. From the back of the eye these cut to the side of the head (proparian) and not to the back. In front of the eye, the right and left facial sutures connect in front of the inflated glabella and consequently the free cheeks (or librigenae) are yoked as a single piece. The part of the skeleton that is ‘tucked under’ (the doublure) has no sutures crossing it to form a rostral plate.<br>The thorax has 11 (rarely 10) segments, the side lobes (or pleurae) are furrowed, and the articulating facets distinct.\n\n The Phacopina contain 3 superfamilies and 7 families:\n\nSuperfamily Phacopoidea\nSuperfamily Dalmanitoidea\nSuperfamily Acastoidea\n\n"}
{"id": "1850879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850879", "title": "Domingo Santa María", "text": "Domingo Santa María\n\nDomingo Santa María González (; August 4, 1825 – July 18, 1889) was a Chilean political figure. He served as the president of Chile between 1881 and 1886.\n\nHe was born in Santiago de Chile, the son of Luis José Santa María González and Ana Josefa González Morandé. He completed his early studies in the \"Instituto Nacional\", and graduated as a lawyer from the \"Universidad de Chile\" in 1847. Soon after, he became a clerk at the Justice Ministry, where he rose to become Official Mayor. At the same time, he became the secretary of the Sociedad del Orden (Society for Public Order), a liberal club opposed to the conservative party.\n\nAt the age of 23, he became Intendant of Colchagua. His active intervention in rigging elections in favor of the conservatives made him into the principal target of the opposition. Two years later, he was asked to resign by his superiors. His refusal sparked his destitution by Manuel Montt. At that point, he joined Montt's opposition and joined the liberal party, participating actively in the 1851 revolution. In 1856, during the clash between the government and the church due to the \"verger problem\" he joined the opposition to the church, a position that would eventually carry to the extreme during his administration.\n\nIn 1858, he was elected to the lower house of congress and a year later, he was forced into exile in Europe as a result of the 1859 revolution. After his return, he remained aloof from politics. He became an attorney of the Appellate Court of Santiago. During the Chincha Islands War, he became a champion for Americanism and his articles made him a public figure. After the war, he returned to politics as member of the lower house, raising to become vice-president of the chamber. He was also a diplomat and was named full member of the Appellate Court and a State Counsellor. In March 1879, he was elected senator. When the War of the Pacific broke out, he was named Minister of Foreign Affairs and soon after, Minister of the Interior. From that position, he had almost total control over the direction of the war and as such became one of the main people responsible for the victory.\n\nAt this point in Santa María's career, he became the natural heir to President Pinto. Although General Manuel Baquedano was also touted as a candidate, Baquedano's resignation left Santa María as the consensus candidate. He was elected president in 1881.\n\nDuring his administration, he continued the War of the Pacific to its end. He managed the capture of Lima and forced Peru to sign the Treaty of Ancon (October 29, 1883), putting an end to war. He also wrote the peace treaty with Bolivia in 1884, basis for the future peace Treaty of 1904.\n\nIn the domestic front, his main fight was against the power of the Catholic Church. He forced through congress the laws of civil marriage, civil registry and public cemeteries, all of which were functions formerly in the hands of the Church. His actions led to a break in diplomatic relations with Rome. He also put an end to the Pacification of the Araucanía, incorporating the area into the territory of Chile. He centralized the railroads into a state holding, inaugurated the first telephonic line between Santiago and Concepcion, and introduced the first public electric lighting.\n\nSanta María's presidency was also marked by increased electoral fraud and intervention in favor of the government liberals. In the parliamentary election of 1881, the conservatives refused to participate, except for Carlos Walker Martínez who was a candidate for deputy. The government went out of its way to prevent Walker's election and in a district with 20,000 voters there were 34,000 votes. The opposition did manage to elect a few anti-government liberals and radicals. In 1885, the electoral fight was much more violent and the conservatives were determined to oppose fraud. Fights between government supporters and detractors left many dead or wounded and there were numerous reports of votes being stolen by government officials. Santa María, far from denying he participated in fraud, openly admitted it. \"I have been called authoritarian. [...] Giving away the votes to unworthy people, to the irrational passions of the parties, and even with universal suffrage, is suicide for a ruler, and I will not commit suicide before a chimera. I can see this well and I will impose myself to govern as well as I can and I will support as many liberal laws as are presented to prepare the ground for a future democracy. Hear me well: future democracy,\" he once said. On another occasion, he simply admitted, \"I have been called an interventor [of elections]. I am. I belong to the old guard and if I participate in intervention it is because I want an effective, disciplined Parliament that collaborates with the government's work for the common good. I have experience and know where I'm going. I cannot let the theorists undo what Portales, Bulnes, Montt, and Errázuriz have done.\"\n\nHe assured the election of his protégé and political heir, José Manuel Balmaceda. After he stepped down, he continued his work as President of the Senate. He died of a heart attack on July 18, 1889.\n"}

Balmaceda was part of the Castilian-Basque aristocracy in Chile. While he was president, his political disagreements with the Chilean congress led to the 1891 Chilean Civil War, following which he shot and killed himself.\n\nBalmaceda was born in Bucalemu, the eldest of the 12 children of Manuel José Balmaceda Ballesteros and Encarnación Fernández Salas. His parents were wealthy, and in his early days he was chiefly concerned in industrial and agricultural enterprises. In 1849, he attended the School of the French Friars, and considered joining the clergy, studying several years of theology at the Santiago Seminary.\n\nIn 1864 he became secretary to Manuel Montt, who was one of the representatives of the Chilean government at the general South American congress at Lima, and after his return obtained great distinction as an orator in the national assembly. In 1868 he joined forces with Justo and Domingo Arteaga Alemparte to found and publish the newspaper \"La Libertad\" (\"Freedom\"). He also was a constant contributor to the \"Revista de Santiago\", and published two monographs: \"The political solution in electoral freedom\" and \"Church and State\". In 1869 he joined the Club de la Reforma, which became the political basis of the Liberal Party. The essential tenets of the political program were freedom of religion, increased personal and political freedom, elimination of governmental intervention in the electoral process, reform of the 1833 constitution and restriction of the powers of the President.\n\nOn the basis of this radical program, he was elected Deputy for Carelmapu several times: 1864–1867; 1870–1873; 1873–1876; 1876–1879; 1879–1882. Under President Aníbal Pinto, he discharged some diplomatic missions abroad, and is credited with persuading Argentina not to join the War of the Pacific in 1878. In 1882 he was re-elected both for Carelmapu and Santiago. He decided to accept neither and became instead successively Minister of Foreign Affairs and Colonization and of the Interior under the presidency of Domingo Santa María. In the latter capacity he carried compulsory civil marriage and several other laws highly obnoxious to the conservatives and the clergy. Balmaceda was also elected a Senator for Coquimbo (1882–1888). He was proclaimed a candidate to the presidency on the Odeon Theater of Valparaíso on January 17, 1886, with the support of the Nacional, Liberal and part of the Radical Parties. On June 25 he was elected President as sole candidate.\n\nBalmaceda became President of Chile in 1886. His election was bitterly opposed by the Conservatives and dissident Liberals, but was finally achieved by the official influence of President Domingo Santa María. On assuming office President Balmaceda endeavoured to bring about a reconciliation of all sections of the Liberal Party in Congress and so form a solid majority to support the administration, and to this end he nominated representatives of the different political groups as ministers. Six months later the cabinet was reorganized, and two of the most bitter opponents of his election were accorded portfolios. But despite his great capacity, Balmaceda's imperious temper little fitted him for the post.\n\nBalmaceda instituted wide-reaching reforms, believing that he had now secured the support of the majority in Congress for any measures he decided to put forward. The new President initiated an unparalleled policy of heavy expenditure on public works, school building, and the strengthening of the naval and military forces of the republic. Contracts were given out to the value of £6,000,000 for the construction of railways in the southern districts; some $10,000,000 dollars were expended in the erection of schools and colleges; three cruisers and two seagoing torpedo boats were added to the Navy; the construction of the naval port at Talcahuano was actively pushed forward; new armament was purchased for the infantry and artillery branches of the Army, and heavy guns were acquired for permanently and strongly fortifying the ports of Valparaíso, Talcahuano, and Iquique.\n\nIn itself this policy was not unreasonable, and in many ways extremely beneficial for the country. Unfortunately corruption crept into the expenditure of the large sums involved. Contracts were given by favour and not by merit, and the progress made in the construction of the new public works was far from satisfactory. The opposition in Congress to President Balmaceda began to increase rapidly towards the close of 1887, and further gained ground in 1888. In order to ensure a majority favourable to his views, the President threw the whole weight of his official influence into the elections for Senators and Deputies in 1888; but many of the members returned to the chambers through this official influence joined the opposition shortly after taking their seats.\n\nIn 1889 Congress became distinctly hostile to the administration of President Balmaceda, and the political situation became grave, and at times threatened to involve the country in civil war. According to usage and custom in Chile at the time, a ministry (the set of ministers) did not remain in office unless supported by a majority in the chambers. Balmaceda now found himself in the impossible position of being unable to appoint ministers that would be supported by a majority in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies and at the same time be in accordance with his policies. At this juncture the President assumed that the constitution gave him the power of nominating and maintaining in office any ministers he might consider fitting persons for the purpose, and that Congress had no right of interference in the matter.\n\nThe chambers were now only waiting for a suitable opportunity to assert their authority. In 1890 it was stated that President Balmaceda had determined to nominate and cause to be elected as his successor in 1891 one of his own personal friends. This question of the election of another President brought matters to a head, and Congress refused to vote any funds to carry on the government. To avoid trouble Balmaceda entered into a compromise with Congress, and agreed to nominate a ministry to their liking on condition that the supplies for 1890 were voted. This cabinet, however, was of short duration, and resigned when the ministers understood the full amount of friction between the President and Congress. Balmaceda then nominated a ministry not in accord with the views of Congress, under Claudio Vicuña, whom it was no secret that Balmaceda intended to be his successor in the presidential chair. To prevent any expression of opinion upon his conduct in the matter, he refrained from summoning an extraordinary session of the legislature for discussion of the estimates of revenue and expenditure for 1891.\n\nWhen January 1, 1891 arrived, the president published a decree in the to the effect that the budget of 1890 would be considered the official budget for 1891. This act was illegal and exceeded the authority of executive power. In response to the action of President Balmaceda, the vice-president of the Senate, Waldo Silva, and the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Ramón Barros Luco, issued a proclamation appointing Captain Jorge Montt as commander of the Navy, and stating that the Navy could not recognize the authority of Balmaceda so long as he did not administer public affairs in accordance with the constitutional law of Chile. The majority of the members of the chambers sided with this movement, and signed an \"Act of Deposition\" of President Balmaceda. On 7 January Waldo Silva, Barros Luco, and a number of senators and deputies embarked on the Chilean warship \"\" accompanied by the \"Esmeralda\" and \"O'Higgins\" and other vessels, and sailed out of Valparaiso harbor and proceeded northwards to Tarapacá to organize armed resistance against the president, launching the civil war.\n\nThis act in defiance of Congress was not the only issue that brought about the revolution. Balmaceda had alienated the aristocratic classes of Chile with his personal vanity and ambition and soon after his election was irreconcilably at odds with the majority of the national representatives. The oligarchy composed of the great landowners had always been an important factor in the political life of the republic; when President Balmaceda found himself outside this circle he endeavored to govern without their support, and to bring into the administration a group of people outside the inner circles of political power, whom he could easily control. Clerical influence also turned against him as a result of his radically secular ideas about government.\n\nOn 23 May 1891, \"London Times\" correspondent in Chile Maurice Hervey alleged British intervention as having been key to the overthrow of Balmaceda, writing, \"Beyond the possibility of contradiction, the instigators, the wire-pullers, the financial supporters of the so called revolution were and are the English or Anglo Chilean owners of the nitrate deposits of the Tarapacá.\"\n\nAfter Balmaceda's forces were overwhelmed and destroyed in the Battle of La Placilla, it was clear that he could no longer hope to find a sufficient strength amongst his adherents to maintain himself in power, and in view of the rapid approach of the rebel army, he abandoned his official duties to seek an asylum in the Argentine legation. On August 29, he officially handed power to General Manuel Baquedano, who maintained order in Santiago until the arrival of the congressional leaders on August 30.\n\nThe president remained concealed in the Argentine legation until September 19. On the morning of that date, one day after the anniversary of his elevation to the presidency and when the term for which he had been elected president of the republic terminated, he shot and killed himself, rather than surrender to the new government. His reason for this act, put forward in letters written shortly before his end, was that he did not believe the conquerors would give him an impartial trial. The death of Balmaceda finished all cause of contention in Chile, and was the closing act of the most severe and bloodiest struggle that the country had ever witnessed.\n\nOn 11 October 1865, Balmaceda married Emilia de Toro Herrera, granddaughter of Mateo de Toro Zambrano, 1st Count of La Conquista, and together they had eight children, six of whom survived to adulthood:\n\n\n\n\n"}

However, several phacopids have very few lenses, such as the species of the genera \"Cryphops\", \"Denckmannites\", \"Dienstina\", \"Eucryphops\", \"Nephranops\", and \"Plagiolaria\", or lack eyes altogether, like \"Afrops\", \"Dianops\", \"Ductina\", and \"Trimerocephalus\". The natural fracture lines (sutures) of the head run along the top edges of the compound eye. From the back of the eye these cut to the side of the head (proparian) and not to the back. In front of the eye, the right and left facial sutures connect in front of the inflated glabella and consequently the free cheeks (or librigenae) are yoked as a single piece. In some of the eyeless genera (\"Ductina\") the suture coincides with the marginal suture, and thus appears to be absent. The part of the skeleton that is \"tucked under\" (the doublure) has no sutures crossing it to form a rostral plate. The thorax has 11 (rarely 10) segments, the side lobes (or pleurae) are furrowed, and the articulating facets distinct. The tailshield (or pygidium) is always smaller than the headshield (or cephalon), a situation called micropygous.\n\nIn the Phacopidae a merger of the anterior and the two pairs of neighbouring lobes of the glabella forms a frontal lobe that expands forward and can be inflated and overhanging the frontal border. To the back of the glabella two furrows (or sometimes one) cross the glabella forming two rings (\"intercalating ring\" and \"occipital ring\"). The cephalon does not end in genal spines. The side lobes of the thorax (or pleurae, singular pleura) have rounded ends. The pygidium is well rounded, semicircular or shorter, with an entire margin, and without lateral and posterior projections. In many Phacopidae, where the facial sutures are apparently continuous and well developed, they were evidently nonfunctional in ecdysis, since no separate free cheeks can be found.\n\nThe Phacopinae likely have evolved from the Pterygometopidae, and the presumed sister taxon is \"Podowrinella\".\n\nThe earliest species and the only one known from the Ordovician (upper Katian) is \"Sambremeusaspis fossesensis\". The Phacopidae became a prominent family during the Silurian and had an enormous taxonomic diversity during the Devonian.\n\nThe following genera are included:\n"}
{"id": "1850930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850930", "title": "Mul Mantar", "text": "Mul Mantar\n\nMūl Mantar (, ) are the opening words of the Sikh scripture, the \"Guru Granth Sahib\". It consists of twelve words in the Punjabi language, written in Gurmukhi script, and are the most widely known among the Sikhs. They summarize the essential teaching of Guru Nanak. The Mul Mantar is a succinct doctrinal statement of Sikhism.\n\nThe Mul Mantar has been variously translated, with the interpretation of the first two words particularly contested. These are rendered as \"There is one god\", \"One reality is\", \"This being is one\" and others. Sometimes the disagreements include capitalizing g in god, or r in reality, which affects the implied meaning in English. Some consider it monotheistic, others monist. The general view favors the monotheistic interpretation, but not the Semitic understanding of monotheism. It is rather \"Guru Nanak's mystical awareness of the one that is expressed through the many.\" The remaining ten words after the first two are literally translated as truth by name, the creator, without fear, without hate, timeless in form, beyond birth, self-existent, (known by) the grace of Guru.\n\nThe Mul Mantar is repeated in the Sikh scripture before numerous Shabad, or hymns. It existed in many versions in the 16th-century before it was given its final form by Guru Arjan in the 17th century. The essential elements of the Mantar are found in Guru Nanak's compositions, the various epithets he used for Akal Purakh (Ultimate Reality). \n\nA \"Mantar\" means \"formula, succinct doctrinal or sacred words with spiritual meaning\". The word \"mūl\" means \"root, main or \"fundamental.\" The Mul Mantar is thus \"root formula\", a succinct spiritual statement, or the root statement of Sikhism.\n\nThe Mul Mantar is:\n\nThe included grave accent in the transliteration illustrates tones and guide the verbal pronunciation of the verse. The small letters in the transliteration above, denoting short vowels, are not etymologically part of the word they are added to, but are included in the Guru Granth Sahib for vocalization purposes.\n\nThe Mul Mantar is a widely known part of Sikh scripture, but it has posed a challenge to translators. The first two words Ik Onkar has been rendered multiple ways. It has been translated as \"'There is one god', as 'One reality is', 'there is one God', 'singularity despite seeming plurality,' and 'This being is one,' and asserts the \"distinctively Sikh theological emphasis\" on \"the ineffable quality of God\" as \"the Person beyond time,\" \"the Eternal One,\" and \"the One without form,\" and is canonically understood in Sikhism to refer to \"absolute monotheistic unity of God\". The varying capitalization of \"God\", \"Reality\", or \"Being\" affects the meaning in English. A number of translations erroneously change the Mul Mantar from a list of qualities to a statement of facts and possessive adjectives. For example, they may change Satnam from \"truth by name\" to \"His name is truth\", which adds a masculine quality to the Mul Mantar which does not appear in the original Gurmukhi. These sacred words of Sikhism do not presume a particular gender. the \"Mūl Mantar\" serves as a \"succinct statement which set the Sikh doctrine apart from the philosophical systems of both Indic and Semitic religious traditions.\"\nSome Sikh institutions, like the SGPC, consider the Mūl Mantar proper to end at \"gur prasad,\" arguing that what follows is the name and first line of the \"Japji Sahib\" composition, citing the number of times that the verse appears as such preceding Gurbani compositions. On the other hand, other historic institutions, like some \"taksals\" (traditional Sikh religious educational institutions) and \"gurmat\" schools, hold the Mūl Mantar to be the full following verse, claiming that the Mūl Mantar in this form has been used in the Amrit Sanchar baptizing ceremony since its inception. This is in line with the stand taken by the \"nihangs\" and other groups who stress the recitation of the complete Mul Mantar, arguing that this tradition has come directly from the time of the Gurus, and there is reliable evidence to support this contention; like the \"kamar kassa\", or waist-belt body armor of Guru Gobind Singh, preserved at Moti Bagh Palace Museum in Patiala, containing the inscription of the long Mul Mantar. \n\nThe extended version with the \"Jap\" verse is:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1850937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850937", "title": "Phacops", "text": "Phacops\n\nPhacops is a genus of trilobites in the order Phacopida, family Phacopidae, that lived in Europe, northwestern Africa, North and South America and China from the Late Ordovician until the very end of the Devonian, with a broader time range described from the Late Ordovician. It was a rounded animal, with a globose head and large eyes, and probably fed on detritus. \"Phacops\" is often found rolled up (\"volvation\"), a biological defense mechanism that is widespread among smaller trilobites but further perfected in this genus.\n\nLike in all sighted Phacopina, the eyes of \"Phacops\" are compounded of very large, separately set lenses without a common cornea (so called schizochroal eyes), and like almost all other Phacopina, the articulate mid-length part of the body (or thorax) in \"Phacops\" has 11 segments.\n\nThe central raised area (or glabella) of the headshield (or cephalon) is moderately to strongly inflated near to its front, more or less flattened on the top, falling vertically to or slightly overhanging the border furrow. Up to three lateral furrows may be discernable on the glabella behind the utterly dominating frontal lobe. From the back there is a very distinct occipital ring, and in front of that a distinct preoccipital ring which is weakly divided into a strongly convex central lobe and weakly convex lateral lobes. The large to medium size eyes have a crescent shaped outline, and are elevated high above the cheeks. The steep visual surface is kidney shaped. The back corners of the cephalon (or genal angles) are acutely to bluntly rounded, but a genal spine is lacking in adults. In the ventral surface of the seam (or doublure) is in the frontal half of the cephalon a continuous furrow, delineated by ridges, and with notches laterally. This so-called vindicular furrow serves to lock the rim of the tailshield to the headshield when the trilobite is enrolled.\n\nThe axial rings of the thorax do not have convex lateral axial nodes on its outer surface. The tailshield (or pygidium) is well segmented. The pygidial axis has 9 to 11 rings, and the pleural areas to the sides have 5 to 8 pairs of recognizable ribs. Furrows between the ribs are deep, those that divide each rib in frontal and rear bands are very shallow, and the frontal bands are widest. The surface of the exoskeleton is covered in tubercles.\n\nThere are specimens known of \"Phacops rana\" with many irregular black spots. Because similar spots in a specimen of \"Greenops boothi\" from the same site are arranged in rows, it may be assumed that they are original and not caused by the fossilisation process. The spots are irregular and have spurs branching outwardly, similar to the melanophores in many extant animals. In one specimen, the black spots are much larger than in another one. It is quite conceivable that changing the size of the melanophores enabled \"Phacops rana\" to camouflage itself in different environments.\n\nThe concept of many fossil taxa has been tightened over time, including \"Phacops\". As a result, \"Boeckops\", \"Chotecops\", \"Paciphacops\", \"Prokops\" and \"Viaphacops\" have been erected as subgenera of \"Phacops\", and are now widely regarded as genera in their own right. Most recent, it was considered that some North-American and North-African species on the one hand and European species on the other hand differ sufficiently from each other to be assigned to separate genera. As the type species is the European \"P. latifrons\", the North-American species are now called \"Eldredgeops\". However, the previous assigned species, like \"Phacops rana\", are still widely used among fossil collectors. \"Eldredgeops\" has a raised ridge along the ventral margin of the cephalon, the glabella is more inflated, the lateral parts of the preoccipital ring are not round but rectangular, the palpebral area and palpebral lobe are larger than in \"P. latifrons\", and there is no fold right behind the posterior vertical row of lenses, nor an isolated raised area just below the lenses. Not all of these characters may differentiate between \"Eldredgeops\" and other \"Phacops\" species however.\n\nDuring the Eifelian in the present-day Belgian Ardennes, several \"Phacops\" species developed from each other, the oldest being \"P. imitator\", followed by \"P. fragosus\", then \"P. latifrons\" and finally \"P. sartenaeri\". These species show a decrease in the number of lenses, which is a more widespread and recurring trend in many Phacopinae.\n\nFossils of \"Phacops salteri\" have been found in the trilobite-rich Late Emsian to Early Givetian Floresta Formation of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, Colombia.\n\n\"Phacops\" currently contains the following species:\nA number of species previously assigned to the genus \"Phacops\" have since been transferred to other genera: \n"}

He studied at the Seminario Conciliar and at the University of Chile. At the age of 17 (four years before graduating as a lawyer) he obtained his first public job as a clerk at the ministry of Justice, in order to help support financially his family.\n\nHe graduated as a lawyer on April 19, 1875, and was promoted to chief clerk at the ministry in 1880. The same year he married his cousin, María Errázuriz Echaurren, thus becoming brother-in-law to future president Federico Errázuriz Echaurren. He became clerk of the Appeals Court of Santiago in 1891, and clerk of the Supreme Court in 1897.

This alliance was formed by the radicals, the democrats, the Balmacedists and the liberals, even though Riesco Errázuriz was more of a Conservative.\n\nFrom the beginning his candidacy was strongly opposed by the clerical-conservative groups.

Nonetheless, he was elected by a huge majority of votes, thanks mainly to the fact that he had almost no political exposure, since most of his life had been spent in the judiciary. Himself summarized his appeal by saying that he \"wasn't a threat to anybody\". He assumed on September 18, 1901.\n\nAs president Riesco was faced with crippling parliamentary divisions. He was forced to appoint no fewer than 17 different governments, each lasting an average of just three and a half months. Even though he had been elected with the support of the Liberal Alliance, he was deserted by them and had to seek the support of the Conservative Coalition (his former opponents). In the end, he had to switch back and forth between both groups in order to complete his term. The result was that since he lacked a congressional majority of his own, he was forced to name caretaker ministers, lacking efficacy or permanence.\n\nAs a former member of the judiciary, his principal efforts were channeled towards legal reforms. He managed to establish a new Code of Civil Procedure (1902) which is still in force today, and a Code of Penal Procedure (1906), which lasted almost 100 years. In 1905 he began construction of the new building for the Supreme Court, that was finished in 1911. He concluded several important public works, such as the sewers for the city of Santiago and the new network of electrical trams. He greatly expanded the secondary education, specially for women, and doubled the number of Normal Schools for the preparation of new teachers.\n\nDue to the rising inflation, he was forced to refuse a return to the metallic conversion, and to authorize a new emission of paper money. This measure caused a dramatic fall in the exchange rates and higher inflation, which in turn gave way to higher social unrest.\n\nOn the international stage, at the end of 1901, Chile and Argentina were on the brink of war, due to border disputes. There was an ongoing naval arms race, and both countries called their reserve soldiers. Nonetheless, diplomacy prevailed, and both countries signed the May Treaties on May 28, 1902, followed by arbitration on Patagonia, on November 20 of the same year. These treaties were complemented by the union of the telegraphic lines of both countries, with commonality of tariffs.\n\nHe signed a final peace treaty with Bolivia on October 20, 1904, putting an official end to the War of the Pacific. He also re-established the diplomatic relations with Peru in 1906, in order to move ahead on the solution of the Tacna and Arica controversy; and gave the first impulse to establishing a claim to Antarctica, by issuing a law regimenting seal-hunting there.\n\nDuring his administration, the so-called \"social question\" suddenly became critical. Between 1903 and 1905, there were a great many strikes in different areas: miners, ship-loaders and railroad workers in the north of the country; house-painters, tanners, postal workers, policemen, garbage collectors and bus drivers in Santiago; coal miners in La Calera, Lebu, Lota and Coronel, ship-loaders in Valparaíso; most of which ended in deaths and injuries of the protesters.\n\nOn October 22, 1905, some of the poorest people in Santiago organized a march to protest for the high price of meat. The price of meat was kept artificially high by the government, by means of the combination of a special tariff applied to cattle imports from Argentina, in order to protect the domestic producers, and high inflation. These factors put the price of the product beyond the financial means of a high percent of the population. By the time that the march arrived peacefully to La Moneda and asked for an audience with President Riesco, it had already swelled to about 25 to 30 thousand people.\n\nThe people started to grow impatient when the president didn't appear, and when the police tried to dissolve them, they fought back and tried to storm the presidential palace. The police responded by shooting at the crowd, and riots ensued. The violence lasted for almost a week, with widespread riots and looting, in what was called the \"Meat riots\" or the \"red week\". Between 200 and 250 protesters were killed over this period. This revolt emphasized that the social problems were far more serious than what the authorities believed.\n\nA few months later, a similar revolt took place in Antofagasta. The workers that were laying the rails for the Antofagasta-Bolivia railroad presented a letter of demands to management, that was completely refused by the company. As a result, a general strike was called. The previous experience with the Meat riots alerted the government, that decided to send in the \"Esmeralda\" regiment and the cruise-ship \"Blanco Encalada\" to reinforce the local forces.\n\nOn February 6, 1906, approximately 3 thousand workers gathered in the public square of Antofagasta to protest in favor of his demands. The troops opened fire on the unarmed workers, causing approximately 58 deaths and more than 300 injured.\n\nThe earthquake had been announced ten days earlier by the chief of the Navy Metheorological Office. August 16, 1906 started as a very clear day, but in the afternoon started to drizzle. As the sun was setting, and when most of the people were having their suppers, came the first shock. It lasted for about 4 minutes.\n\nAfter the first shock, people started to look for survivors. After approximately fifteen minutes, the second shock hit the port. This one was shorter, approximately a minute, but far stronger than the first one. It completed the destruction of the city and caused most of the victims. Most of the city was leveled, and some looting happened. The governor decreed martial law and any looter caught in the act was shot immediately.\n\nWith the total interruption of the communications, the city was isolated. The first news arrived to Santiago (located only 120 kilometers inland) on the afternoon of the 17. Three days later, on the 20, the ministers of Interior and War managed to arrive to the port. President Riesco and the newly elected Pedro Montt arrived on the 25. They had to travel by train, on foot and by horseback in order to arrive to the destroyed port.\n\nHe died in Santiago, at the age of 62, on December 8, 1916, of a heart ailment.\n\n\n"}

Locations of the observations relative to the control chart control limits (typically at ±3 standard deviations) and centerline indicate whether the process in question should be investigated for assignable causes. The Western Electric rules were codified by a specially-appointed committee of the manufacturing division of the Western Electric Company and appeared in the first edition of a 1956 handbook, that became a standard text of the field. Their purpose was to ensure that line workers and engineers interpret control charts in a uniform way.\n\nThe rules attempt to distinguish unnatural patterns from natural patterns based on several criteria:\nThe absence of points near the centerline is identified as a mixture pattern.\n\nThe absence of points near the control limits is identified as a stratification pattern.\n\nThe presence of points outside the control limits is identified as an instability pattern.\n\nOther unnatural patterns are categorized as systematic (autocorrelative), repetition, or trend patterns.\n\nThis classification divides the chart of observations into zones, measured in units of standard deviation (σ) between the centerline and control limits, as follows:\nZones A, B, and C are sometimes called the \"three sigma zone\", \"two sigma zone\", and \"one sigma zone\", respectively.\n\nAn important aspect of the Western Electric rules are the zone rules, designed to detect process instability, and the presence of assignable causes.\nData sets of observations are appraised by four basic rules, that categorize the occurrence of data samples in a set of zones defined by multiples of the standard deviation.\nThese rules are evaluated for one side of the center line (one half of the control band) at a time (e.g., first the centerline to the upper control limit, then the centerline to the lower control limit).\n\nData satisfying any of these conditions as indicated by the control chart provide the justification for investigating the process to discover whether assignable causes are present and can be removed. Note that there is always a possibility of false positives: Assuming observations are normally distributed, one expects Rule 1 to be triggered by chance one out of every 370 observations on average. The false alarm rate rises to one out of every 91.75 observations when evaluating all four rules.\n\nThe zone rules presented above apply to control charts with symmetric control limits. The handbook provides additional guidelines for control charts where the control limits are not symmetrical, as for R charts and p-charts.\n\nFor formula_1 and R charts (which plot the behavior of the subgroup range), the Handbook recommends using the zone rules above for subgroups of sufficient size (five or more). For small sample subgroups, the Handbook recommends:\n\nFor other control charts based on skewed distributions, the Handbook recommends:\n\nThe handbook also identifies patterns that require consideration of both the upper and lower halves of the control chart together for identification:\n\n"}

{"id": "1851008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851008", "title": "Boom Town (Doctor Who)", "text": "Boom Town (Doctor Who)\n\n\"Boom Town\" is the eleventh episode of the first series of the British science fiction television programme \"Doctor Who\". The episode was first broadcast on BBC One on 4 June 2005. It was written by executive producer Russell T Davies and directed by Joe Ahearne.\n\nThe episode is set in Cardiff in the early 21st century, six months after the 2005 episode \"World War Three\". In the episode, the criminal alien Slitheen named \"Margaret Blaine\" (Annette Badland) attempts to gain her freedom after being captured and detained by the alien time traveller the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston).\n\n\"Boom Town\" was a replacement episode for a story that was to be written by Paul Abbott, but he had to abandon the script because he had other commitments. Davies decided to write a different story centred on bringing Badland's character back from the fourth and fifth episodes of the series, \"Aliens of London\" and \"World War Three\", as he had enjoyed her performances. Primarily, Davies wanted to explore the consequences of the Doctor's actions and question whether he had the right to sentence an enemy to death. The episode was also intended to showcase Cardiff, where the revived \"Doctor Who\" series is made, and where the episode was filmed in February 2005. \"Boom Town\" was watched by 7.68 million viewers in the United Kingdom and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nThe Ninth Doctor lands the TARDIS in Cardiff, using the energy of the Cardiff Rift to recharge the engines of the time machine. Mickey joins the Doctor, Rose, and Jack for lunch. The Doctor spots a newspaper article showing Margaret Blaine, a Slitheen, has become Cardiff's new mayor. The four track down and capture Blaine to find out what she is doing there. The Doctor observes Blaine's scale model plans for a new nuclear power plant, but identifies that it is purposely flawed to cause a meltdown that would open the Cardiff Rift and destroy the Earth. He also discovers the model contains an \"extrapolator\" that Blaine would have used to flee the Earth. The Doctor decides to take Blaine back to her home planet of Raxacoricofallapatorius, but she reveals that she has received a death sentence there and will be executed upon returning. The Doctor agrees to her final request to accompany her to a dinner meal. Blaine makes several half-hearted attempts to kill the Doctor but he easily avoids them. She then asks him to take her to another planet instead.\n\nJack begins integrating the extrapolator into the TARDIS to speed up the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he claims to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him. Before Rose can answer whether she will come back to Mickey, Cardiff is struck by a large earthquake that is coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Blaine, Rose, and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Blaine takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Blaine in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Blaine's human suit is empty except for an egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Blaine wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Blaine can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye. She runs out to look for him, but finds he has gone.\n\nThe Rift was established earlier in the series in \"The Unquiet Dead\". Margaret says that as a child she was threatened with being fed to venom grubs; these creatures appeared in the First Doctor serial \"The Web Planet\" (1965).\n\nAccording to an interview with executive producer and episode writer Russell T Davies in \"Doctor Who Magazine\", this episode was originally offered to his friend and former colleague, the critically acclaimed and award-winning scriptwriter Paul Abbott. Abbott accepted and submitted a storyline, revealing that Rose had been bred by the Doctor as an experiment in creating a perfect companion. The episode was titled \"The Void\". However, Abbot had to abandon the project due to other commitments. Davies wrote \"Boom Town\" instead, bringing back Badland as Blaine due to her performance in \"Aliens of London\" and \"World War Three\" being \"brilliant\", though she had few lines. The actor playing Mr Cleaver, William Thomas, had previously appeared as Martin the undertaker in the 1988 classic series story \"Remembrance of the Daleks\". This made him the first performer to appear in both the original and current run of \"Doctor Who\". He later played Geraint Cooper, the father of Gwen Cooper, in the \"Doctor Who\" spinoff series \"Torchwood\".\n\nDavies stated that he originally intended to call this episode \"Dining with Monsters\". He joked that a much better name for this episode would be \"What should we do with Margaret?\" Davies intended the episode to be a character piece exploring whether the Doctor had the authority to take someone to their death sentence, as well as showing the consequences of the Doctor's actions the last time he met Margaret. The storyline was fitting for Eccleston's war-torn Doctor. The consequences of the Doctor's lifestyle is also explored through Rose's boyfriend Mickey, who has been forced to move on because she is not around. The resolution is a deliberate deus ex machina, regressing Margaret so she can start anew, although Davies remarked that the resolution did not come completely out of nowhere as the TARDIS' psychic link had been already established.\n\nMuch of \"Boom Town\" was filmed on Cardiff Bay, with one scene in particular in front of the Millennium Centre, in February 2005. The Doctor is seen reading the Welsh newspaper \"Western Mail\"; Davies stated that he wanted to incorporate Welsh culture because the series is made in Wales and contains a lot of Welsh crew members. He also wanted to show off how beautiful the area could be. The night shoot of Rose and Mickey in front of the water tower at Roald Dahl Plass had to be extended to two nights because it was below the temperature at which the fountain automatically shuts off. The dinner scene between the Doctor and Margaret was filmed in January 2005 at the Cardiff restaurant Bistro 10 before the rest of the episode was filmed; Eccleston filmed the scene while Piper and Barrowman were filming scenes for \"The Empty Child\". This was due to scheduling conflicts with Badland. Some of the schedule was also rearranged because of the death of Piper's uncle, resulting in her and Eccleston being replaced by doubles during some scenes near the end of the episode. The egg Margaret turns into was a reused prop from the second episode, \"The End of the World\".\n\n\"Boom Town\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 4 June 2005 on BBC One. The episode received overnight ratings of 7.13 million viewers, a 36.95% audience share and an increase over the past two weeks. When final ratings were calculated, the figure rose to 7.68 million. The episode received an Audience Appreciation Index score of 82.\n\n\"SFX\" described \"Boom Town\" as a \"format-breaking episode\". The reviewer acknowledged that it \"certainly misfires on some levels, and leaves various elements underdeveloped\", but praised the moral dilemma, including the dinner scene. However, the conclusion with Margaret being reverted to an egg was seen as a \"little too handy and provides the Doctor with a moral get-out clause\", and the Rose and Mickey subplot was called \"weak\" due to the lack of evidence he and Rose were ever close. Arnold T Blumburg of \"Now Playing\" gave the episode a grade of B+, writing that it \"sacrifices a bit of plot and logic\" for a good exploration of the characters and plot threads. He praised the dialogue and Murray Gold's score. Digital Spy's Dek Hogan was more negative, feeling that it \"really didn't work\", calling bringing back Margaret a \"poor idea\", and he criticised the pace for dragging too much.\n\nIn 2013, Patrick Mulkern of \"Radio Times\" particularly praised Badland and the dinner scene, though he described the whole episode as a \"peculiar short-story, a low-cal filler sandwiched between the dramatic juggernauts of Steven Moffat's \"Doctor Who\" debut and Russell T Davies's dazzling finale.\" \"The A.V. Club\" reviewer Alasdair Wilkins gave the episode a grade of B, noting that it required more suspension of belief than usual. He felt that the plot was included out of necessity while the episode was more focused on character moments, and that this did not work as well as \"Father's Day\" because Margaret's fate was \"less clearly motivated.\" On the other hand, Wilkins called Rose and Mickey's subplot the most effectively handled part of \"Boom Town\". In \"Who Is the Doctor\", a guide to the revived series, author Robert Smith? called the episode \"highly entertaining\" and \"thoughtful\", despite not being well-plotted with an \"unsatisfying\" deus ex machina ending. He praised the character material and comedy. His coauthor Graeme Burk was less enthusiastic, describing it as \"nothing more\" than a \"fun romp\". He felt that there were many good scenes but \"no real story\", and pointed out how the moral dilemma did not matter because the decision does not end up being in the Doctor's hands.\n\n"}

Brasted lies on the A25 road, between Sundridge and Westerham; the road is named Westerham Road, High Street and Main Road as it passes through the village east to west. Brasted is 6 km west of Sevenoaks town. The parish had a population of 1321 (2001 census) and includes the hamlets of Brasted Chart, Toys Hill and Puddledock. The village of Brasted has a number of 18th-century houses with several antique shops, pubs and residences. The parish church is dedicated to St Martin.\n\nThe name is recorded as \"Briestede\" in 1086, one of only two large manors in the hundred of Westerham described in the Domesday Book, and as \"Bradestede\" around 1100; it is from Old English \"brād\" + \"stede\" and means \"broad place\". After the Domesday hundreds of Kent were consolidated, Brasted was in the \"Hundred of Westerham and Edenbridge\". From 1894 to 1974, Brasted was within the Sevenoaks Rural District.\nIn the 18th century and earlier, Brasted had the economic advantage of a watermill.\n\nBrasted had a railway station on the branch line running between Westerham and Dunton Green that opened in 1881 and closed in 1961.\nJohn Turton (1735–1806), famed physician to King George III, was the first owner of Brasted Place, one of only two houses in Kent that were designed by neoclassical architect Robert Adam. In the 19th century, Napoleon III lived in Brasted Place. During the 20th century, surrounding acreage was sold for mainly residential uses. Following its disuse as a country house, it was eventually repurposed as commercial office suites. In the early 21st century, architect and restorationist Michael Wilson crafted a seven apartment interior for Brasted Place, now within an eight acre park. Its lodge and gateway also became listed historic buildings.\n\nAustralian soft-drink manufacturer George Marchant was born in Brasted in 1857. During the Second World War the local pub, the White Hart, was popular with RAF fighter pilots stationed at nearby RAF Biggin Hill.\n\nJust to the north of Brasted the M25 motorway passes in a west–east direction; the River Darent has its source near the village.\nBrasted Chart is a hamlet within the civil parish of Brasted. It lies to the south of Brasted and the north of Four Elms. Its road, Chart Lane, leads to another hamlet called Toys Hill to the south. There is no chapel or church; however there are numerous Grade II listed buildings, the former stables and coach house and linking wall and mounting block to the south west of the house of Foxwold. Similarly, all the buildings (Cottage, Oast House, Piggery and former dairy, now a base camp for private group bookings and working holidays) at Outridge Farm (owned by the National Trust) have Grade II listed building status. The Oast Houses are unique in that the cowls are octagonal, in comparison to the usual conical shape found in both Kent and Sussex.\n\n"}

{"id": "1851040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851040", "title": "List of Trigun characters", "text": "List of Trigun characters\n\nThe \"Trigun\" anime and manga series features an extensive cast of characters created by Yasuhiro Nightow. The series takes place on a fictional desert planet where humanity has taken up root after leaving Earth. In this western/steampunk setting, civilization is sparse and mostly lawless. The plot and characters of the series differ greatly between the original manga and its anime adaption, the anime only following roughly up to the second volume of the manga before diverging into its own unique telling of the story. The series' storyline follows the adventures of the legendary gunman \"Vash the Stampede\" as he spreads his message of love and peace throughout the world while combating his brother Millions Knives and the Gung-Ho Guns assassins' leader Legato Bluesummers.\n\nThe main character of the series is Vash the Stampede, a jovial, pacifist gunman who is always followed by disaster and misfortune due to the large bounty on his head. During the early part of the series he is constantly chased by Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, insurance agents assigned with the duty of evaluating damages involving Vash. Early on he also meets Nicholas D. Wolfwood, a violent and serious traveling preacher who becomes Vash's strongest fighting ally and friend throughout his adventures. Over the course of the series, Vash interacts and befriends many people across the globe. At odds with Vash and his companions is his twin brother Millions Knives, who hates humans and Vash's way of life. Closely following Knives is Legato Bluesummers, a cold and powerful man and his group of super-powered assassins, the Gung-Ho Guns.\n\n\n is a sentient Plant known as \"The Humanoid Typhoon\" due to the destruction which surrounds him. Wielding a huge silver revolver, he travels from town to town. He is initially discovered by Meryl and Milly, representatives from an insurance agency investigating claims made due to damages caused by the mysterious \"Humanoid Typhoon\". The pair find Vash while he is being chased by bandits who want to collect the bounty on \"The $$60,000,000,000 (sixty billion double dollar) Man\". He and his brother, Knives, were born on a colony ship that was part of a fleet sent to find and settle a new world in order to extend the human race. They were raised by Rem, who instilled upon Vash the philosophy that every being deserves life, and Vash now takes this to the extreme by always attempting to save everyone. Knives on the other hand, sickened by the actions of the humans around him, caused the fleet to crash, which killed Rem and many others. Vash has made it his purpose to hunt down and stop Knives from harming anyone else. Vash was forced to destroy the city of July during one of his confrontations with Knives, which haunts him considerably and starts his reputation.\n\nDue to his overly exaggerated reputation, Vash usually acts the fool in order to make people feel comfortable and to hide his identity. He frequently voices the catchphrase, \"This world is made of love and peace,\" which is usually complemented by his flashing of the v sign. However, when those around him are threatened, Vash shows complete focus and control. Because Vash refuses to kill his opponents, he often suffers at the hands of his very persistent enemies. As a result, his body is a patchwork of large scars and chunks of missing flesh supported by metal mesh. In the anime, Vash lost his left arm during the conflict in July. In Volume 12 of the Trigun Maximum manga, it is revealed in a flashback that it was severed by Knives in retaliation for Vash shooting him in the shoulder after Knives massacred an entire town. It is later replaced by a cybernetic arm that contains an integrated gun. Vash says his full name is Valentinez Alkalinella Xifax Sicidabohertz Gombigobilla Blue Stradivari Talentrent Pierre Andri Charton-Haymoss Ivanovici Baldeus George Doitzel Kaiser III, but this may just be another exaggerated joke.\n\nVash's main weapon is the \"Angel Arm,\" a large cannon capable of destroying cities. The anime depicts it as a modified version of the Dan Wesson ppc 357, specially created by Knives to fuse with Vash and transform into the \"Angel Arm\" itself. In the manga however, it is shown as being a natural part of a Plant, with far greater versatility, capable of being manipulated into various forms other than a cannon. In the manga, it is powered by the life-force of its user, and using the power slowly causes Vash's life to drain, which causes his hair to slowly turn black. Vash later learns better control over his power, forming smaller cannons and defensive feathers, though his hair continues to grow darker until it becomes almost completely black. The anime, however, depicts no such restrictions.\n\nA recurring joke in the anime is that characters will facetiously mistake a cat for Vash. For example, when he and Wolfwood are eating, Vash disappears and a cat turns up in his place. This prompts Wolfwood to say \"I always had my suspicions that you were no mere mortal, but I never imagined that you were actually a cat.\"\n\n\"AnimeOnDVD\" describes Vash's character as \"..running a gamut of emotions and attitudes (and shows off his way cool dancing moves) as well as a bit of what makes him the most feared person and worthy of the $$60,000,000,000 price on his head...\" In a review for Volume 5, the reviewer stated that the change in Vash's character; \"..brings things to a different and more interesting level..\" Vash's history was described as \"..really interesting but they tend to have more questions asked than really answered.\" \"T.H.E.M Anime Reviews\" say that Vash \"...is the poster-child for the misunderstood hero..\" Various merchandise on Vash's appearance has been made including plush dolls, keychains & action figures.\n\nIGN ranked Vash as the 17th top anime character of all time, praising his character design.\n\n AKA \"Derringer Meryl\" and her junior coworker, Milly, are agents of the Bernardelli Insurance Society sent to evaluate claims regarding Vash the Stampede. She's hotheaded and strong willed. Initially, she finds Vash to be a nuisance and dismisses the idea that he is the legendary Humanoid Typhoon. As time passes, she realizes that Vash isn't the villain that he is made out to be nor the buffoon that he presents himself to be. Gradually, she comes to respect Vash and love him deeply, though in the anime her love is more romantic than in the manga. Meryl eventually forms a special bond with him that allows her to overcome the obstacles that she is faced with. She hides dozens of derringer-style \"throwaway\" pistols under her traveling cape and is an excellent shot, although she rarely has occasion to use them. In the manga she becomes frightened of Vash's plant-like nature. At one point she sees his memories as a child growing up and struggling alone to the destruction of July City through his eyes. After Bernardelli shuts down while Knives is ravaging the planet, she and Milly assume support roles along with Brad and Luida to help combat Knives. At the end of the manga's story, the two become investigative reporters for the planet's first television broadcasting channel, continuing to follow Vash wherever he goes.\n\n AKA \"Stungun Milly\" is a fellow Bernardelli agent, and friend and assistant to Meryl. Despite physically towering over Meryl, Milly looks up to her and always refers to her in a respectful manner. She appears rather simple, but has a kind heart and also reveals a strength of character and genuine optimism. Milly comes from a very large family, and writes huge masses of letters to them constantly (known as \"The Milly Monthly\"). Milly manages to hide a very heavy concussion gun, referred to as a \"stun-gun\", under her coat. The shots, which pop out into the shape of an X-shaped claw, are so powerful they can even knock over trucks. Although she does not have a relationship with Wolfwood in the manga, events after his death indicate that she might have had a romantic interest in him. In the anime, Milly spends the night with Wolfwood before his death and her reaction to the loss of Wolfwood in the anime is considerably greater than in the manga. The manga version of Milly has blond hair whereas the anime depiction has browner-colored hair.\n\n, also known as Nicolas the Punisher, is a member of the Eye of Michael, an organization of assassins. After showing potential in the orphanage in which he was raised, Chapel trained and modified him, giving him enhanced abilities and the ability to regenerate from heavy injuries using special vials, though this causes him to age much faster than normal. He was given a special large cross-shaped gun called the Punisher, which contains two machine guns and a rocket launcher. In the anime one of the Punisher's unused arms is shown to contain a rack of pistols. Wolfwood later shoots Chapel and takes his place in the Gung-Ho Guns in an attempt to kill Knives. He fails to do so and is instead sent by Knives to protect Vash until he is able to meet him. After Vash is captured, Wolfwood rescues him and battles his childhood friend, Livio, and his master, now in a wheelchair. He manages to kill Chapel and defeat Livio as well as Livio's alternative personality, Razlo, but having overdosed on the regenerative vials, he soon dies while having a drink with Vash.\n\nIn the anime, Wolfwood was raised by an abusive guardian, whom he later shoots and kills. He was taken in by Chapel, who trained him to be his successor. He meets Vash while he is stranded in the desert and the two join forces. Wolfwood's purpose is to raise money for the children in the orphanage he runs, trying to keep other children from suffering as he did in his own childhood. He initially holds the ideals that he must kill, though he eventually comes to accept Vash's ideals. He eventually fights his master, but spares him after defeating him. Legato forces Chapel to shoot Wolfwood, who stumbles into a church and dies. Vash then takes his gun as an act of honor and uses it fighting against Knives. During the series, Wolfwood develops a relationship with Milly that crosses from close friendship into romance and him sleeping with her shortly before his death.\n\n is the main antagonist of the \"Trigun\" manga and anime and is one of the few fully sentient Plants and Vash's twin brother. They are both born during a mission to further the human race, and they are taken care of by Rem until Knives disrupts the course of the ships, causing them to crash. While Vash believes all beings have potential for good and deserve life, Knives believes in the survival of the fittest. After discovering experiments performed on other plants, he decides that humans are evil and grotesque, and that they need to be eradicated. Vash does not agree with his plans and seeks to stop him, and Knives seeks to dissuade Vash from basing his life around the \"idealistic nonsense\" preached by Rem. \n\nHis character changes, even if slightly, from the manga to the anime; the manga version is shown to be apathetic towards humans but has a caring attitude with other Plants (as he mourns the death of Plants and even apologizes to one for his impulsiveness when \"sacrificing all of those companions\" when he was younger) and cares about Vash to the point of almost absorbing his twin brother so they can stop fighting and prevent his death. Before his general hatred, Knives is shown to be the most enthusiastic of the twins to interact with human beings, before the discovery of Tessla. \n\nIn the anime, Knives evolves from an introverted child to a ruthless sociopath bent on exterminating all humans on the planet. Although he is the primary antagonist, he appears only in flashbacks for most of the series and only appears in person during the last few episodes. Acting on a tip from Wolfwood, Vash finds Knives at a desert oasis in the final episode, leading to a cataclysmic battle. They hold each other to a stalemate at first, but Knives gains the upper hand and tries to annihilate Vash with the power of both brothers' angel arms. Vash shoots him repeatedly, disabling him, then bandages his wounds and carries him back to the nearest town.\n\nHis role is far more prominent in the manga. Many years after landing, the two meet in the city of July, and the face off leaves Vash without his left arm and Knives in a very critical state. He slowly regenerates over a period, and forms the Gung-Ho-Guns to act for him. After he revives and learns that he is slowly dying by using his abilities, he begins absorbing other plants into himself, which causes his powers to grow exponentially. After fusing with thousands of plants, Knives launches his \"Ark\", a floating ship designed to leave humans without any resources. As he absorbs more and more plants, his Ark takes on the form of a sentient organism, capable of defending itself and, in some cases, even teleporting short distances. Vash and Knives eventually fight for a final time, and after the battle, Knives saves Vash from the exploding Ark. After he brings Vash to safety, Knives uses the last of his power to make an apple-tree and then dies.\n\n is a man who devotes himself to Knives, and makes it his main goal to have Vash experience eternal pain and suffering. He serves directly under Knives, which also gives him command of the Gung-Ho Guns. \n\nIn the manga, Legato takes over while Knives is injured, and uses the Gung-Ho Guns to play a \"game\" with Vash. He gives Vash a case and each Gung-Ho Gun a half coin to place into it, stating to him that \"something interesting will happen\" after it is completed. After Knives recovers, Legato's body is crushed and his neck twisted for using the Gung-Ho Guns for his personal agenda. Legato is consequently restricted to a coffin-like container, which is carried by an ogre. Legato later gains a new coffin with metal appendages that allows limited movement. He eventually learns to use his threads to manipulate and strengthen his own body, and takes up a ball and chain weapon and a handgun to battle. He later fights Vash with the coin case completed and subsequently activated, which nullifies his threads, and loses. He then forces Vash to kill him by threatening to kill Livio. \n\nIn the anime, Legato, recruited by Knives to make Vash's life a living hell, is placed as the leader of the Gung-Ho Guns and receives Vash's left arm from Knives, granting him the ability to manipulate victims with telepathy. He worships Knives as a god, and sees humans like himself as garbage, only good for consuming resources. Legato forces Vash to kill him by using his powers to threaten Milly and Meryl. Legato thus becomes the first person that Vash ever consciously and willfully kills, fulfilling Legato's promise to \"make Vash the Stampede feel eternal pain and suffering\".\n\n was a crew member of a SEEDS ship from Earth meant to populate another planet. On Earth, Rem had a lover named Alex, and she took part in the mission in order to start over after his death. In the manga, a sentient Plant was born during the mission and named Tessla. The crew proceeded to perform extensive tests on Tessla, actions opposed by Rem and her crew mate, William Conrad, and which ultimately ended with Tessla's dissection and death. Vash and Knives were born later and, fearing for their safety, Rem kept their birth secret from the other members while they were in stasis. In the anime, Vash and Knives were the only sentient Plants whom Rem protected from the other members of the crew. She raised and mentored them. Her teachings of love and peace, especially that no one has the right to take a life, had a profound influence on Vash. The reason why Vash wears a red coat is that Rem told Vash about her favorite flower, the \"Red Geranium\", which means determination. When Knives sabotaged the fleet, putting it on a crash course with the planet on which Trigun is set, she put him and Vash in an escape pod, but chose to stay behind and attempted to prevent the crash rather than escaping. She managed to undo Knives' tampering, allowing a number of the ships to land safely, but perished when her ship exploded in the atmosphere. Her last words to Vash were \"take care of Knives\".\n\nThe are a group of assassins assembled to cause great pain to Vash the Stampede. Each one is human, but has sacrificed their humanity in order to gain power, often leaving them mutilated. Each Gung-Ho Gun has an assigned number, but not all numbers are revealed. In the manga, Legato uses them to play a \"game\" with Vash. He has them each carry half a coin, and gives Vash a case that contains the other half of every coin. He explains that if Vash can reassemble the coins (12 in all), something interesting will happen; it turns out that the filled case can block Legato's powers during their later fight.\n\nMonev the Gale was hired as an assassin to fight Vash. Knives locks him in a cell to train his body for twenty years in order to gain the skill and power required to kill Vash. He wears a powered battle suit and carries two high-powered gatling guns on his arms. These guns fire extremely fast due to the pressure chambers located on his back, and have tremendous stopping power, enough to tear through entire buildings. He also carries a wide variety of weapons in a big cloth rucksack, including an enormous minigun, powerful enough to punch through a bank vault. He is defeated by Vash and killed afterward as punishment.\n\nHis life is spared in the anime, but he is later killed by E.G. Mine along with Dominique (see below) due to his failure.\n\nDominique the Cyclops has an ability known as the \"Demon's Eye\", which causes hypnosis and sensory paralysis in her foes, momentarily stunning them and making her movements appear immediate. This effect happens when she lifts her eye-patch, which reveals a reptilian eye in the manga and a red eye in the anime. Vash defeats her by placing pressure on a finger he had injured previously, allowing him to concentrate on the pain and avoid focusing on her eye. In the anime she survives her encounter with Vash but is killed by E.G. Mine and her body is tied to a cross to display for Vash. She commits suicide in the manga to avoid being punished.\n\nE.G. Mine is a violent man who wears a suit that resembles a sphere and contains control threads for deploying lethal spikes. Further manipulating these threads, Mine can hurl them towards an enemy. He is quickly defeated in the manga, and he is killed by Rai-Dei after Vash defeats him in the anime.\n\nRai-Dei(雷泥) is a samurai who seeks the knowledge learned only when facing death. He carries a sword with a built in gun that can be fired from the hilt, but not meant for shooting, instead when he fires the gun in the middle of his swing it allows him to swing his sword with enough force to create a sonic blast. In the anime, he expresses anger in the fact that Vash is refusing to make his mark true and aim to kill, claiming he wants \"a real battle\". He escapes after Vash's Angel Arm is forced to activate, though Wolfwood soon kills him. In the manga, he wears \"roller skates\" that allow him to move at phenomenal speeds. After Vash defeats him, Rai-Dei attempts to attack Vash from behind, but is quickly killed by Wolfwood.\n\nLeonof the Puppet-Master is an elderly man who controls numerous puppets with an elaborate system of wires. He can manipulate them to look like real people, and uses them to do horrible things to people close to Vash. His real name is Emilio, having known Vash during his childhood. His love interest dies sometime after, and he goes into puppet making to mend his broken spirit. He cares for her body for a number of years until he battles Vash in the ruins of the station he had Vash lived on. During the battle, his love's corpse falls off a cliff, causing him to jump after it and fall to his death. \n\nThe anime does not feature his background, and he is simply an assassin who can use his puppets to do various tasks, such as delivering reports to Legato, spying on people, and attacking them. After Leonof kills Brad using a puppet double of his longtime friend Jessica, Wolfwood kills Leonof in turn. Vash uses some of Leonof's control wires in his fight against Hoppered the Gauntlet, and later during his final showdown with Knives.\n\nGray the Ninelives is a very large man known for being indestructible. The manga version shows that he is actually formed from nine dwarfs controlling a mechanical suit from the inside, allowing them to keep fighting until all nine are dead. The suit is destroyed and only two survive. They are captured and turn over their coin, and later escape.\n\nThe anime version is a cyborg whose only remaining human part is his brain, which is deeply encased in armor. Wolfwood shoots out a pipeline filled with corrosive liquid, which pours down on Gray and melts his armor to expose the brain and internal frame, and he then blows Gray's upper body apart with the rocket launcher in his Cross Punisher. However, the legs remain active and deploy a hidden launcher of their own to destroy one of the plants powering the ship, leading to its crash.\n\nHoppered the Gauntlet is a masked man who wears a set of armor to cover his degenerated and vestigial legs, while using his large arms to move. The armor acts like a top and he uses a shield to propel himself at high speeds. He seeks to kill Vash to avenge a mute and blind woman detached from the world, killed during the destruction of July. He eventually loses his mask, exposing a large cross carved into his face. During his final battle, he sees Vash's memory of July, has a revelation that he has made the wrong choice, and he is killed after turning against the Guns.\n\nThe anime does not feature his backstory or expose his face, and instead has him just wish to make Vash suffer. After Vash deflects his attack with a well-placed gunshot, he hurls himself into one of the plants powering the ship, leading to its crash.\n\nZazie the Beast is a collective of group-minded insects able to take over the bodies of humans. These insects are the original inhabitants of the planet No Man's Land, who form an alliance with Knives to see whether humans or Plants are better to co-exist with them. They originally take over the body of a young boy, but it is destroyed by Hoppered after spying on him. Zazie later reappears in the body of a teenage girl, though it is also destroyed by Legato after trying to infect Knives. The last body is an odd-looking man in disco-clothing used to deliver his coin to Vash. The main hive is destroyed by Knives soon afterward. \n\nIn the anime, Zazie is a demon who has possessed the body of Bete, a troubled young boy capable of controlling sand-worms with a high-frequency device he wears on his head. Vash shoots and destroys the device, and Zazie takes full control of Bete to hold Vash, Meryl, and Milly at gunpoint. He is killed by Wolfwood, prompting a heated disagreement between the two over their morals. (In the manga, the conflict is triggered by Wolfwood's killing of Rai-Dei.)\n\nMidvalley the Hornfreak is a violent musician who is able to use his tenor saxophone to generate destructive sound as well as play frequencies that drive those that hear it into a murderous frenzy. He is also capable of neutralizing sounds completely by playing counter-frequencies. He and his band originally just killed for money until being found by Knives, who killed all except Midvalley after they refused Knives's offer to join him. Terrified and resentful of Knives and Legato, Midvalley attempts to betray and desert the Guns, but once discovered by Legato, he is quickly killed himself. Legato uses Midvalley's body to attack Hoppered, and it is buried with his saxophone on his gravestone afterward.\n\nIn the anime, Midvalley plays Sylvia, a hybrid between an alto and tenor saxophone, mainly acting as Legato's bodyguard before being the last Gun to fight Vash. In their battle, Midvalley reveals his ability to synchronize sound waves with pain receptors in the body. Vash damages his horn with several carefully placed shots, preventing him from being able to play, and Midvalley commits suicide by triggering the now-jammed machine guns hidden in the bell so that they backfire into his chest.\n\nCaine the Longshot is a member of the Gung-Ho Guns invented for the anime in place of Elendira the Crimsonnail. He is a mute, talented sniper who utilizes a rifle with a barrel many meters long; its scope allows him to fire on targets from many miles away. The poncho he wears can change its coloration to perfectly blend in with his surroundings, and he also wears a broad-brimmed hat and a steel mask whose left eye is patched shut. Vash distracts him long enough to shoot his rifle to pieces, but instead of surrendering, Caine commits suicide by shooting himself in the head with a revolver. He is later buried in the desert, with his hat and a piece of the rifle barrel marking the grave.\n\nElendira the Crimsonnail, referred to as the lost thirteenth Gung-Ho Gun in the manga, is the most powerful of the group. She is a transvestite, and normally wears feminine clothing and a pillbox hat. She shoots giant nails from a large briefcase that transforms into a crossbow with great proficiency, being capable of launching several in less than a second. However, underneath her outer garments she also wears restraining armour, and after disabling it, she is able to move at blinding speed. Elendira also has the power to project the image of the death of her opponents by touch, crippling them with the realistic illusion. She is jealous of Legato, as Legato is not part of the Guns, suggesting that Legato is more important to Knives than she. Elendira was apparently one of Knives' very first companions, seen walking with him as a child along with Legato. She fights Livio twice, the first time skewering his torso with many nails after launching him through several buildings. Their subsequent rematch results in a similar outcome, despite Livio and Razlo's combined efforts to match her speed. However, Elendira is ultimately killed when Livio grabs her and uses one of the nails going through his torso to run Elendira through.\n\nMerely known as \"Chapel\" in the manga, he is a member of the \"Eye of Michael\", an organization of ecclesiastical assassins founded by a church that worships Plants. They provide Knives with mercenaries, with three slots of the Gung-Ho Guns reserved for the Eye of Michael's best. Chapel, also known as 'Master C', is the mentor of Wolfwood, teaching him all the skills in being an assassin. He is subsequently shot and left as a paraplegic by Wolfwood, who impersonates Chapel. He is only middle aged, but, like the rest of the members of the Eye, the artificial modifications on his body which grants him enhanced strength and reflexes and limited regenerative abilities have aged him considerably. He is wheelchair bound after Wolfwood shot him, and wields a large cross-shaped machine gun similar to Wolfwood's Punisher with four spiked ends at the base of the cross. Wolfwood kills Chapel with an immense head butt, cracking his skull and breaking his neck.\n\nThe anime features Chapel the Evergreen as Wolfwood's direct mentor. He carries the parent version of Wolfwood's Cross Punisher, though Chapel's splits into twin machine guns. He cares for Nicholas after Nicholas kills his abusive guardian. He dresses in a dark green suit and has red goggles grafted to his face. He is killed by Knives after an unsuccessful attempt to kill Legato for taking control of him and forcing him to kill Wolfwood.\n\nLivio the Double Fang is a childhood friend of Wolfwood and the final member of the Gung-Ho Guns from the Eye of Michael. He wields the Double Fangs, two small cross-shaped machine guns strapped on his arms that fire from both ends. His body has been enhanced through increased metabolic rate, allowing him to recover from near fatal wounds in a matter of seconds. He grows up in the same orphanage as Wolfwood, having the nickname \"Livio the Crybaby\". \n\nRazlo the Tri-P(unisher) of Death is a violent and psychotic split personality, treated as another member of the Gung-Ho Guns. After repeated abuse by his father, Livio eventually developed the Razlo personality, with Razlo taking all the abuse, allowing the Livio persona to not know about it. Razlo only appears after Livio has suffered intense pain or violence, and often commits act of violence, such as killing Livio's parents. He uses three Punishers, the same gun as Wolfwood owns, with the aid of a bionic arm, thus giving him the nickname 'the tri-p of death', short for Tri-Punisher of Death. He is aided by three servants who carry his Punishers while Livio's persona is active.\n\nThe two fight with Wolfwood and they are defeated, though Wolfwood dies after sustaining immense injuries while overdosing himself on the regeneration drug. In the aftermath of the fight Livio comes to terms with Razlo's existence stating that he is now strong enough to face life on his own without the questionable help of his psychotic personality, who recedes in the back of his mind. Vash decides to forgive Livio afterward, and he becomes Vash's partner in an act of redemption, seeking to live as Wolfwood would have. Livio fights against Elendira. Unable to win himself, Livio allows Razlo to awake and help him kill the Crimsonnail, by utilizing Razlo's faster reflexes and better eyesight. Livio later lives together with the children in his old orphanage and is shown paying his respects to Wolfwood's gravestone.\n\n is a black cat who reoccurs in the background of the anime and manga. She appears in every episode of the anime and randomly in the manga. Nightow has stated that she is just something easy and calming to draw in between action scenes. His most common response to queries as to her nature or significance at anime convention panels is \"Kuroneko-sama is a small black cat.\"\n\nIn Trigun Maximum, Kuroneko-sama only appears in Nightow's commentary at the end of each issue, often criticizing the author's lazy and silly nature. Kuroneko-sama also makes several cameo appearances in the anime adaptation of Nightow's other work, Blood Blockade Battlefront.\n"}

{"id": "1851046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851046", "title": "Cartagena Manifesto", "text": "Cartagena Manifesto\n\nThe Cartagena Manifesto was written by Simón Bolívar during the Colombian and Venezuelan War of Independence, after the fall of the First Republic, explaining with great detail and precision what he believed to be the causes of this loss. It was written in Cartagena de Indias, on 15 December 1812. This is the first of Bolívar's public documents, which due to his later fame as the \"Liberator of five nations,\" have become quite well known. The document contained the conceptual framework of his new agenda, which he then acted out in the field.\n\nPrior to the document's publication, Bolívar had been an officer in the Venezuelan army. The First Republic, however, was defeated due to a number of movements that confronted and exploited each other such as the royalists who fought for the old order, the supporters of independence who fought for creole supremacy, and the \"pardos\", blacks, and slaves who fought for their liberation. The conflict was exacerbated by a number of factors such as the shortage of provisions and the effects of the 1812 Caracas earthquake, among others. Bolivar started acting on his own, leaving La Guaira on a Spanish ship. He briefly stayed in Curaçao before finally arriving in Cartagena. he accepted a commission in the army of the United Provinces of New Granada (Colombia), which later granted him permission to lead a force to free Venezuela, in what became known as the Admirable Campaign.\n\nIn Cartagena Manifesto, Bolivar outlined a framework that would prevent New Granada from suffering the fate of Venezuela since the territory reproduced the prevailing pattern of colonial dissent from loyal juntas to independent governments. The political, economic, social, and natural causes which Bolívar mentioned included:\n\n\nBolivar advocated a strong central government and powerful executive to avoid infighting between city, state, and national authorities, which in his view created stalemate, dissipating funds and energy. He stated that \"the government must necessarily adjust itself, so to speak, to the context of the times, men, and circumstances in which it operates. If these are prosperous and serene, it has to be gentle and protective, but if they are calamitous and turbulent, it has to be severe and armed with a strength equal to the dangers.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1851063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851063", "title": "UK national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest", "text": "UK national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nEurovision: You Decide is the most recent name of a BBC television programme that was broadcast annually to select the United Kingdom's entry into the Eurovision Song Contest. The show had previously gone under several other names, including \"Festival of British Popular Songs\" (1957), \"Eurovision Song Contest British Final\" (1959–1960), \"The Great British Song Contest\" (1996–1999), \"Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up\" (2004–2007), \"Eurovision: Your Decision\" (2008), and \"Eurovision: Your Country Needs You\" (2009–2010), but was known, for most of its history, as A Song for Europe (1961–1995, 2000–2003).\n\nThe selection process, originally broadcast on BBC One, has varied between selecting both the performer and song, or just the song in some years. For most years the public has been able to vote for the winner, in the past with postcard voting, where the viewers sent postcards with their vote to the BBC, but more recently televoting and online. In 2009 and 2010, the singer was chosen by a public vote and the song internally selected.\n\nThe most recent name and format was adopted in 2016, as between 2011 and 2015 the UK representation had been selected internally by the BBC, resulting in the televised selection show being suspended. On 30 September 2015, the BBC confirmed the show would return in 2016 and on 17 January 2016 that the national selection show would return and be called \"Eurovision: You Decide\" and broadcast on BBC Four.\n\nOn 9 December 2016, it was confirmed that \"Eurovision: You Decide\" would return on 27 January 2017 and aired on BBC Two. The format returned in 2018 and 2019, again broadcast live on BBC Two. The national selection shows have been hosted by a variety of presenters over the years. Mel Giedroyc has hosted since its return in 2016, being joined by co-host Måns Zelmerlöw from 2018 onwards. The \"You Decide\" format was scrapped in September 2019 and an internal selection is to be used for the UK's 2020 participation, with BBC Studios and music company BMG collaborating in order to find the entry which will then be released and published by BMG.\n\nThe format of the show and the manner in which the winner is chosen has gone through many mutations. In its early days, there was a round of televised semi-finals, with the winner chosen by regional juries situated across the country. This format was used until 1960. During this era the show was known as the \"Festival Of British Popular Songs\" (1957) and \"Eurovision Song Contest British Finals\" (1959 & 1960). In 1961 the show became known by its more familiar title, \"A Song For Europe\", with regional juries once more deciding the winner. Typically, during that period, singers would be invited by the BBC to choose and perform a song that they liked from the shortlist available. Household names such as Petula Clark, Lita Roza, Anne Shelton, Frank Ifield, Ronnie Hilton and David Hughes were amongst the contenders for the UK competition, none of whom were able to secure the much cherished ticket to the Eurovision final. In the early 1960s, record companies became involved in the selection process for the first time and submitted songs by their artists. This produced hits for Craig Douglas, Karl Denver, Jackie Lee, Kenny Lynch, Vince Hill and Ricky Valance, but again, none of them were selected to go forward to the Eurovision Song Contest final itself.\n\nFrom 1964 up until 1975, an artist would be chosen by the BBC, and that artist would sing all six songs (five in 1966 and 1967) in the selection, and the public (bar 1964 and 1971) would choose by postcard which song they would like to represent them in the contest. Regional juries selected the winner in 1964. A postal strike in 1971 prevented the ballot from taking place, so regional juries were once again constructed to pick the winner. In 1972, national power cuts meant that the broadcast of the show was blacked out in many areas, leading to a much lower postal vote. In its early days of this format, only \"light entertainment\" singers were used, such as Kenneth McKellar and Kathy Kirby. However, the poor showing of McKellar in Luxembourg (he placed 9th of 18 entries with scores from only 2 countries, including top marks from Ireland) prompted the BBC to use more mainstream pop stars, which led to a run of successful results for the UK. This idea was dropped due to the low number of postal votes cast in the contest of 1975, in which all six songs were performed by The Shadows, and after objections from songwriters who felt The Shadows, and the BBC's selections in general, were not the sort of artists they wanted to represent their music.\n\nAfter 1964, the \"Song For Europe\" selection process was incorporated into other BBC light entertainment shows, in addition to the songs being broadcast on BBC Radio programmes. Typically, the performer would sing one song a week either on their own series or as a guest on another regular BBC TV show, more often than not, televised on Saturdays. This culminated with the performer singing all the songs one after another in a special edition of the given show. From 1968 to 1975, these performances were then immediately repeated before viewers were asked to cast their votes by mail. The following week, the winning song would be announced and performed once more, although there was a two-week wait in 1965. In 1968, Cliff Richard performed the songs only in a special edition of Cilla Black's eponymous TV series (broadcast on Tuesdays), without having sung them weekly beforehand. The various shows chosen for the \"Song For Europe\" performances were \"The Kathy Kirby Show\" (1965 shown on Fridays), \"Kenneth McKellar's A Song For Everyone\" (1966 shown on Thursdays), \"The Rolf Harris Show\" (1967), \"Cilla\" (1968 and 1973), \"Lulu\" (1969 and 1975), \"It's Cliff Richard!\" (, and ) and \"Clunk, Click... As It Happens\" (1974) – when in a break with the format, Olivia Newton-John performed three songs a week for two weeks rather than one a week for six weeks. Originally, Cilla Black's 1974 nine-part BBC series was also scheduled to feature the 'Song for Europe' process, but Black was uncomfortable at promoting another female singer (Newton-John) each week throughout the series' run and in a rather last minute decision, the BBC arranged to move the process to another show, necessitating the contracted process.\n\nThis period was highly successful for the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest. Author and historian John Kennedy O'Connor notes in his book \"The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History\", that every UK entry to the contest from 1967 to 1977 finished in the top four, with only three songs not being first or second. Indeed, the UK were only 7 points short of four consecutive victories from 1967 to 1970.\n\nIn 1976, the method used from 1961 - 1963 was reinstated. Twelve songs were performed by artists chosen by the songwriters themselves and the winner was chosen by regional juries across the country during a stand-alone show called \"A Song For Europe\". This system produced an immediate success by choosing the song which went on to be the Eurovision winner that year, \"Save Your Kisses for Me\" by Brotherhood of Man. The first few years of the revamped format also saw a plethora of well-known names take part in the competition. Frank Ifield, Tammy Jones, Sweet Sensation, Lyn Paul, Tony Monopoly, Carl Wayne, Hazell Dean, Tony Christie, The Foundations, Labi Siffre, Guys 'n' Dolls, The Nolan Sisters, Polly Brown and Sweet Dreams all took part in the competition, but none were successful. Likewise, the first two winners of the contest, Brotherhood of Man and Lynsey de Paul & Mike Moran, had many hits under their belts before attempting Eurovision.\n\nIn 1977, a strike by BBC cameramen led to the contest being blacked out on TV, although the show went ahead and the audio portion was later broadcast on BBC Radio 2. The TV programme has never been broadcast and is not listed in the BBC archives, yet it was transmitted to the various regional juries in BBC studios around the country, in order for them to cast their votes. The 1979 \"A Song For Europe\" final was never held at all, due to a strike by BBC sound engineers. The juries had to judge using audio recordings of the rehearsals. The songs were presented to the public on Terry Wogan's radio show the following day, after the result was known, followed later in the day with a spot on the TV magazine show \"Nationwide\", where the top 5 were revealed and the winners, Black Lace, were interviewed as guests on the show. As a result of this industrial action, all future contests were staged at BBC studios and not as outside broadcasts from venues. The 1980 result ended in a tie between Prima Donna's \"Love Enough For Two\" and Maggie Moone's \"Happy Everything\". To resolve this, in an unrehearsed panic, host Terry Wogan called back the juries to announce their favourite of the two songs. This led to extreme confusion when the scoreboard failed to keep up and some juries contradicted the results they had given earlier. Prima Donna won, with eight juries to Maggie Moone's six. A detailed check of the votes after the show did confirm that Prima Donna were the correct winners. Prima Donna were the first winners of the competition specifically formed to take part in Eurovision. This became the norm in the 1980s and the artists taking part in the contest became more and more obscure and amateurish. However, a few notable acts did enter the contest in the 1980s, with scant success. Liquid Gold, Alvin Stardust, Sinitta and Hazell Dean all failed to come through the heats.\n\nBy 1981, the number of songs had dropped to eight, and interest had started to wane. Four out of eight songs in both the 1982 and 1984 events were written by Paul Curtis, who was unsurprisingly responsible for the 1984 winner; \"Love Games\". Following Belle & The Devotions' performance at the 1984 Eurovision contest in Luxembourg, the audience audibly booed them from the stage in an orchestrated demonstration against the song's supposed plagiarism, and by the local audience retaliating against a particularly shocking violent attack by English soccer fans. For 1985, the BBC wanted to revert to having one singer of their choice perform all the short listed songs and approached Bonnie Tyler and when she was unavailable, Lena Zavaroni for the task. However, the Music Publisher's Association blocked the move, wanting their members the choice of their own singers to represent their music. A compromise was reached and only solo artists or duets – no \"made for Eurovision\" acts – were permitted to take part in the 1985 UK selection process and limited two entries per songwriter. Despite this rule, both songs submitted by Paul Curtis reached the final eight. They reverted to allowing all-comers for 1986. Starting in 1985, the songs were also 'previewed' on Terry Wogan's prime time chat show on BBC1 ahead of the final. When the series ended in 1992, the songs were presented in 1993 and 1994 in stand-alone programmes, hosted by Terry.\n\nThe number of entries briefly increased to ten in 1987 when record companies were invited to submit songs, but after a poor result from Rikki in the Eurovision final of 1987, the regional juries were disbanded, and the final decision given to the public through telephone voting, with a celebrity panel offering comments on the entries intended to guide viewers. This proved to be a relative success, accruing two second places and a sixth place (Zagreb, 1990). However, a disappointing 10th place in Rome obtained by Samantha Janus led the BBC to rethink the standard of performers in the competition.\n\nAs a result of the disappointing results in 1990 & 1991, the system that was used between 1964 and 1975 was resurrected, with the BBC's head of light entertainment, Jim Moir choosing one artist to perform all the songs in the UK final. Michael Ball was the first in 1992, and went on to win second place. Sonia was also second the following year. However, after a suggestion by Don Black to the BBC's new head of light entertainment David Liddiment in 1994, Tony Award winning stage star Frances Ruffelle was offered the job of representing the UK. A virtually unknown singer, unsurprisingly, interest was low. Her final position in the Eurovision Song Contest held in Dublin was a disappointing tenth, the same achieved by Samantha Janus in 1991.\n\nA dramatic modernisation was introduced in 1995 in an attempt to boost the profile of the contest. Pop supremo Jonathan King was drafted in as Executive Producer to make the event more modern. The 1995 event had a diverse range of songs and some relatively well-known acts performing, such as Londonbeat who had a hit with \"I've Been Thinking About You\", pop-combo Deuce and Sox, which featured singer and former Page 3 icon Samantha Fox. All songs were presented on a special edition of \"Top Of The Pops\" prior to the live final. On the night, the well-known artists were all beaten by rap act Love City Groove, whose eponymous song could only manage a disappointing tenth in Dublin that year. On a positive note, the songs by Love City Groove and Deuce (\"I Need You\") made the top 10 in the UK singles charts, reaching #7 and #10 respectively, while three other entries – Dear Jon \"One Gift of Love\" at #68, Londonbeat \"I'm Just Your Puppet On A... (String!)\" at #55 and Sox \"Go For The Heart\" at #47 – all reached the UK top 100.\n\nIn 1996, a semi-final was introduced. All eight songs were performed on \"Top of the Pops\" on 1 March, and the public voted to decide the four finalists. The results were announced the following day, but there was no information given on who finished where. On 8 March the final was held, with Gina G winning very easily with her dance number \"Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bit\". The song became an instant hit in the charts, reaching Number 1 on the UK Singles Chart. It was the first UK non-winner to do so since 1968 but it was not as successful in the Eurovision Contest itself. In Oslo, Gina could only manage eighth place, but was perhaps consoled by her Europe-wide hit with the song, which also became one of the few Eurovision songs, and one of the relatively few dance songs, to be a major hit in the United States where it peaked at #12 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, was #1 on their Dance Chart and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Dance Recording.\n\nJonathan King resigned, certain that, if Gina G couldn't win, nothing he selected could, but the BBC persuaded him to stay in charge and he decided to retain the same formula again, but with an added twist. All eight contestants would be heard on Ken Bruce's radio show on BBC Radio 2, with a public vote to decide the four finalists. The four would perform on \"The National Lottery Live\" until 1998, and then on \"Top of the Pops\" in 1999. The final itself would just consist of repeats of the performances made in the above shows, in a special programme on a Sunday afternoon. Jonathan persuaded his friends Katrina and Kimberley Rew, who had hit with \"Walking On Sunshine\", to enter a new track, \"Love Shine A Light\". This produced a win in the Eurovision Contest itself for the United Kingdom and for Katrina and the Waves in 1997, and followed with a second place for Imaani in 1998, but disappointment in 1999 for the all-female band Precious.\n\nIn 2000, the same format continued, but the final four songs were performed live in \"A Song For Europe\", still shunted to a graveyard Sunday afternoon slot. The result proved disappointing. Nicki French gave what author John Kennedy O'Connor describes in his book The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History as a far from strong performance, despite her previous chart success and attained the UK's worst ever placing at the time, a mere 16th in Stockholm with \"Don't Play That Song Again\". This format continued the following year, and another poor showing for the UK. Lindsay D only got one place higher in Copenhagen. The entries from Six Chix in 2000 and Luke Galliana, the latter of which didn't make the 2001 final, became minor hits, with Galliana just failing to make the Top 40, but becoming a popular hit on cable request line music channel The Box.\n\nThe 2002 \"A Song For Europe\" generated a lot of publicity, because three of the four acts that made the final were relatively well known to TV viewers, albeit not necessarily for their singing ability. Surf 'n' Turf included Jonathan Maitland who is a TV presenter of consumer advice shows such as \"Watchdog\" and \"House of Horrors\". Tricia Penrose is an actress who plays Gina in the 60s retro drama \"Heartbeat\" on ITV, and Jessica Garlick had made the final stages of another ITV show \"Pop Idol\". The standard of songs was stronger than previous years, and Jessica Garlick had a runaway victory of nearly 70,000 votes with her ballad \"Come Back\". The song was also a success in Eurovision with it finishing joint third with host country Estonia.\n\n2003 saw terrible disappointment. The new voting system of regional televoting, where 9, 10 and 12 points were awarded to the top three songs, led to an unsuccessful winner. Jemini's \"Cry Baby\" won by four points over \"Help Me\" by Emily Reed. Confidence in the UK entry was low for both fans and the public, and in the actual contest held in Riga, Jemini picked up the UK's worst-ever showing, scoring \"nul points\" and finishing last, due to a very poor performance, although some reports attempted to blame European disapproval of the US-UK invasion of Iraq for the failure of any nation to give the UK even one point. As noted by author and historian John Kennedy O'Connor, with 26 entries in the Eurovision field, this made \"Cry Baby\" the least successful song in the entire history of the contest. No song in the Eurovision final scored \"nul points\" again until 2015.\nThe 2004 selection was totally different. Gone was the \"Song For Europe\" name, replaced with \"Making Your Mind Up\". The radio semi-final was also gone, and the six songs were performed live in a Saturday night show. This raised the profile of the competition, although there was criticism of the fact that four of the six acts were from reality TV shows. The winner, chosen by 70% regional televoting (regions awarding 0,2,4,6,8 and 12 points) and 30% SMS and Interactive voting, was James Fox, who had finished fifth in the second series of \"Fame Academy\", with a gentle ballad \"Hold On To Our Love\", written by Gary Miller and Tim Woodcock. Viewing figures were peaked at over 7 million for the results show. The song finished 16th at the contest in Istanbul.\n\nFor 2005, six songs dropped to five, and the show was moved to an early Saturday evening slot on 5 March, to avoid a clash with \"Comic Relief Does Fame Academy\"; and Natasha Kaplinsky replaced Gaby Roslin as co-host with Sir Terry Wogan. The press focused on two performers. Javine Hylton who is a relatively well-known urban singer, and Katie Price, aka Jordan, a famous glamour model. The other contestants included former 3SL bandmember Andy Scott-Lee, the 1996 British Eurovision entry Gina G and unknown opera trio Tricolore. The voting itself was the same format as the previous year, but this time an online jury was added to decide between the contestants to take account of the views of those watching in the rest of Europe. After an exciting voting sequence, Javine came out on top with her ethno-urban song \"Touch My Fire\", although she also caused some controversy when she briefly fell out of her top during an energetic dance routine. At the 50th Eurovision Song Contest held in Kiev, Javine finished 22nd out of 24 participants in the final, the UK's second poorest finish ever.\n\nIn February 2006 it was announced that artists competing in the 2006 contest would include Kym Marsh and Antony Costa, both relatively well known in the UK for their past involvement with music bands (the former appearing in Hear'say and the latter in boy band Blue). Following the format of the previous year (and with six songs this time), \"Making Your Mind Up\" returned in 2006 in a prime-time Saturday evening slot, and was broadcast on 4 March on BBC One. Terry Wogan and Natasha Kaplinsky once again presented and were accompanied by a 'Celebrity Jury' that included chat-show host Jonathan Ross, pop star Kelly Osbourne and \"Top of the Pops\" presenter Fearne Cotton. The eventual winner of the 2006 contest (after the 7 tele-juries from around the UK and mobile and web votes) was Daz Sampson and his song \"Teenage Life\". Yet another low result was produced for the United Kingdom, as Daz finished 19th in the contest out of 24 competing countries.\n\nDuring a press conference on 28 February 2007, the BBC confirmed that the artists taking part in \"Making Your Mind Up\" would include Big Brovaz, an RnB group who had 4 UK Top 10 singles in 2002–2003, Brian Harvey, a former member of the boy band East 17; Cyndi; Justin Hawkins of The Darkness, performing a duet with Beverlei Brown; Liz McClarnon, formerly of girl group Atomic Kitten; and Scooch, the eventual winners with \"Flying the Flag (for You)\". Scooch sang their entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 on 12 May 2007 in Helsinki, Finland and finished in second-to-last place with 19 points, ahead of Ireland who placed last.\n\nFor the first time, the show was filmed at The Maidstone Studios in Kent. The hour long final was broadcast at 7:30pm on 17 March 2007 on BBC One, with the half hour results show showing at 9:30pm on the same date. Although this was past the 12 March cut-off set by the EBU, the BBC were given a special extension because the EBU were made aware of this over a year in advance.\n\nThe show ended in disarray when Fearne Cotton shouted out that the winner was Scooch, while co-host Terry Wogan simultaneously announced the winner to be Cyndi. After some confusion from both performers, each thinking the other had won, it was revealed that the true winner was Scooch.\n\nIn 2008 the show's name was changed to \"Eurovision: Your Decision\". It was screened in two parts in March 2008, and was hosted by Claudia Winkleman and Sir Terry Wogan. The six competing acts were paired as girl groups (LoveShy and The Revelations), soloists (Michelle Gayle and Andy Abraham), and \"Joseph and Maria\" contestants (Rob McVeigh and Simona Armstrong) from the BBC talent shows \"Any Dream Will Do\" and \"How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?\". A panel of three judges (John Barrowman, Carrie Grant, and Terry Wogan) decided which artists to put through to a semi-final after each pair had performed. Terry Wogan then allowed one of the rejected acts through as a \"wild card\" before viewers were invited to vote by phone to decide which two would perform again in the final. The two finalists chosen by the viewers were Michelle Gayle singing \"Woo (You Make Me)\", and Andy Abraham singing \"Even If\". Despite having been originally eliminated at the first stage, Terry Wogan's \"wild card\" pick turned out to be the winner when the viewers voted Andy Abraham the victor with \"Even If\". This received a total of 14 points in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 on 24 May 2008 in Belgrade, finishing in last place, although sharing the same score with Poland (24th) and Germany (23rd).\nThe BBC announced in a televised call for talent on 18 October 2008, that in 2009 there would be another change to the national final. The show was renamed \"Eurovision: Your Country Needs You\", hosted by Graham Norton, and followed a format similar to popular BBC talent shows \"I'd Do Anything\" and \"Any Dream Will Do\". The multi-week format had members of the public (amateur or professional) compete to represent the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, which was to be held in Moscow, Russia. In the final the three remaining contestants performed the song \"It's My Time\", composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber with lyrics by Diane Warren. The winner of the contest was Jade Ewen who went on to score a credible fifth place at the Eurovision final in Moscow.\n\nFor 2010, the BBC announced on 29 January 2010, that songwriter and music producer Pete Waterman would be writing the UK's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest in Oslo, Norway, on 29 May. Waterman's writing partner was Mike Stock and the singer was chosen on 12 March, in a live show featuring six potential artists broadcast on BBC One, hosted by Graham Norton. Waterman chose three of the six acts to perform his song \"That Sounds Good To Me\", with the televiewers then selecting the winner. The winner was Josh Dubovie, who represented the UK in Oslo on 29 May and finished last with 10 points. The 2010 song was heavily criticised by fans and the media. Celebrity gossip blogger Christopher Couture went as far as to say \"...last year, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Jade Ewen proved a good song and a good singer can get us a good score. This year, we're back to the bottom of the leaderboard as Pete 'stuck in the 80's' Waterman offers a song that even Butlins would call tacky.\"\n\nOn 29 January 2011, the BBC confirmed that boy band Blue had been chosen to represent the UK in the 2011 contest in Düsseldorf with the composition \"I Can\" written by Duncan James, Lee Ryan, Ciaron Bell, Ben Collier, Ian Hope, Liam Keenan and 'StarSign'. Band member Antony Costa had tried to represent the UK in 2006 as a soloist, placing second in the heat behind Daz Sampson. Other Blue personnel Lee Ryan had written one of the finalists in the 2005 UK heat and Duncan James was a panellist in the 2009 heat, going on to announce the UK scores at the Eurovision final from Moscow. James posted in a separate Twitter message that they have pre-selected their own song. The process thus excludes the UK viewing public from any participation in the British Eurovision selection for the first time. Blue became the first UK representatives since The Shadows in 1975 to have had multiple No.1 singles in the UK chart prior to appearing in Eurovision, and the first since Sonia in 1993 to have had a chart-topper at all. A documentary entitled \"Eurovision: Your Country Needs Blue\" was produced for BBC One broadcast on Saturday 16 April 2011. The group placed 11th at the Eurovision final with 100 points and peaked at no.16 in the UK singles chart.\n\nFor 2012, Engelbert Humperdinck was selected internally by the BBC to represent the UK in Baku, Azerbaijan with the song \"Love Will Set You Free\". The song is written by Grammy award-winning producer Martin Terefe and Ivor Novello winner Sacha Skarbek, who co-wrote James Blunt hit \"You're Beautiful\". It was reportedly recorded in London, Los Angeles and Nashville. At 76 years of age, Humperdinck was the oldest artist ever to appear for the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest and the first UK artist since 1976 to sing first. He placed second-to-last, only beating Norway.\n\nAnother internal selection took place for 2013, with Bonnie Tyler being chosen by the BBC to represent the UK in Malmö, Sweden. She came 19th in the Eurovision contest.\n\nA fourth internal selection followed in 2014, with Molly Smitten-Downes, under her artist name of Molly, being chosen to represent the UK with the song \"Children of the Universe\", written and composed by Smitten-Downes herself. However, Smitten-Downes was an unknown artist who was chosen through the BBC Introducing scheme. The announcement of the selected artist and song was revealed on 3 March 2014 in a show entitled \"The UK Launch\", and broadcast via the BBC Red Button service. The song finished in 17th place at the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nA fifth internal selection in 2015 selected the unknown act 'Electro Velvet' who went on to represent the UK with the song \"Still in Love with You\". The song was met with a mixed to negative reaction by the media and public. The artists and song were presented to the public in a special presentation show titled \"Our Song for Eurovision 2015\" broadcast via the BBC Red Button service in March 2015. In the final the UK could only manage 24th place out of the 27 entries.\n\nThe BBC announced on 30 September 2015 that the national public vote format would be returning for the 2016 contest. The 2016 competition consisted of six entrants, performed and broadcast live on BBC Four from The O2 Forum in Kentish Town, London on 26 February and hosted by Mel Giedroyc. The six acts were selected by the UK branch of the international OGAE fan club, the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) and Hugh Goldsmith, former MD of RCA Records and founder of Innocent Records. The six competing songs were premiered during \"The Ken Bruce Show\" on BBC Radio 2 on 22 February 2016. \"You're Not Alone\" performed by Joe and Jake won the national final; 746,000 viewers watched the show either live or within 7 days of its broadcast, making it the third highest rating program for BBC Four in the week ending 28 February 2016. The duo placed 24th out of 26 entries at the Eurovision final in Stockholm, peaking at No.81 in the UK singles chart.\n\nOn 6 October 2016, the BBC announced that the \"You Decide\" show would return in 2017 with more details to be announced later in the year. On 9 December 2016, it was confirmed that \"Eurovision: You Decide\" would return on 27 January 2017. The 2017 competition consisted of six entrants, performed and broadcast live on BBC Two from the Eventim Apollo, in Hammersmith, London. The songs were revealed on 23 January during \"The Ken Bruce Show\" on BBC Radio 2. Six acts competed in the national final. The winner was selected through a public vote and, for the first time, the votes of a professional jury panel. Lucie Jones with the song \"Never Give Up on You\", written by Lawrie Martin, The Treatment and Danish Eurovision 2013 winner Emmelie de Forest, won the show. At the contest in Kiev, Jones finished in 15th place, having placed 10th on jury votes alone, but attaining a weak score from public voting.\n\nOn 29 September 2017, it was confirmed that \"Eurovision: You Decide\" would return in 2018 on BBC Two. On 16 November 2017, Måns Zelmerlöw was announced as co-host for the UK national selection, which took place on 7 February 2018 at the Brighton Dome. The Dome was the venue for the Eurovision Song Contest 1974. The contest was won by SuRie performing \"Storm\" written and composed by Nicole Blair, Gil Lewis and Sean Hargreaves. The national final was watched by 900,000 viewers in the United Kingdom with a market share of 4.8% and thus failed to register in the Top 30 programmes viewed on BBC Two for the week. At the contest, the song placed 24th, but became infamous for its performance being disrupted at the live Grand Final in Lisbon by a stage invader.\n\nSong submissions for the 2019 edition opened on 19 September 2018. On 30 November, the BBC announced that a new format would be used for 2019. Three songs, selected with the help of an international jury, were each performed in two musically different styles by two different artists, with one act from each pair going through to a final public vote. For the first time, the national final was broadcast live from Dock10, MediaCityUK in Salford. On 11 January, the date of the national final was confirmed as 8 February. Michael Rice's rendition of \"Bigger than Us\", written and composed by Laurell Barker, Anna-Klara Folin, John Lundvik and Jonas Thander, won the national final. However, the song finished dead last in the Grand Final in Tel Aviv, making it the fourth time in the past 16 years that the United Kingdom has finished bottom of the scoreboard.\n\nOn 16 September 2019, it was announced that \"You Decide\" had been axed and that the song selection would return to the internal selection format most recently used between 2011 and 2015. The entry for the 2020 contest was chosen in collaboration with BMG. It was announced on 27 February 2020 that James Newman would represent the UK with the song \"My Last Breath\", however the contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor UK Singles Chart positions, only tracks that have appeared in the officially recognised and published Top 50 (to 1978), Top 75 (to 2012) and Top 100 (from 2012) are included. Any track that fell below the published threshold was not a UK chart hit.\n\nFrom 1964–1975, the \"Song For Europe\" programme was pre-recorded, often several weeks in advance. The result was typically broadcast one week after each \"Song For Europe\" programme. From 1988–1991, in 1995, and again from 2004–2008 the result was broadcast in a separate programme, shown later the same night as the performances. From 1986 to 1995, \"A Song For Europe\" was also broadcast on BBC Radio 2 with commentary by Ray Moore in 1986–87 and later by Ken Bruce from 1988, although Radio 2 did not broadcast the results show from 1991 onwards.\n\nFrom 1992–1994 the programme was again pre-recorded, but the result show was live and broadcast on the same, or following night. In 1997 and 1998, the results were announced the next Saturday after the final and on the following Friday in 1999.\n\nFrom 1957–1960, there were various televised semi-finals ahead of the UK final. This was reintroduced in 1996, with a preliminary round of voting to eliminate 4 of the 8 songs. This was televised in 1996 but switched to radio from 1997 to 2003.\n\nFeatured in 1988–1990, 1994–1995, 2004–2010 and 2016–2019.\n\n\nFeatured in 1957, 1959 to 1964, 1976 to 1978, 1980 to 1987 and from 2003 to 2006. Although regional juries were used in 1979, the broadcast was abandoned and the scores tallied without announcements.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1851065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851065", "title": "Project Exile", "text": "Project Exile\n\nProject Exile is a federal program started in Richmond, Virginia in 1997. Project Exile shifted the prosecution of illegal technical gun possession offenses to federal court, where they carried a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in federal prison under the federal Gun Control Act of 1968, rather than in state court. Note that federal law (18 U.S. Code § 922(g) & 924) provides for a penalty of ten years in federal prison for being a \"prohibited person\", i.e., a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, as well as for falsifying information in order to obtain one, or furnishing a gun to a convicted felon.\n\nThe program has since been copied by several other cities, sometimes under other names. In Atlanta, for example, the program was known as FACE 5 (Firearms in Atlanta Can Equal 5 years in federal prison). While many have discontinued or modified their programs, Project Exile is still in effect in Rochester, NY.\n\nThe program was designed to address the gang violence which had plagued Richmond. At the time of its inception, the level of murders and shootings had regularly increased each year, with Richmond's murder-per-capita rates being one of the highest five for the country. In 1997, 140 people were murdered, 122 of them with firearms. There was strong community support for federal intervention. The African American community was being devastated by the violence (80% of all the homicide victims in Richmond were African-American). Half of the victims had no prior criminal record and many were innocent bystanders, the result of drug dealers' poor marksmanship and wild shooting at targets of opportunity. The guiding principle of the program was to remove from the streets those who were mostly likely to commit gun violence: criminals with guns. This included convicted felons caught with guns (federal law prohibits felons from owning firearms) and those who committed crimes with a gun. It also intended to deter would be-offenders with strict sentencing, specifically longer sentences with no possibility of bail or early release.\n\nProject Exile was named for the idea that if the police catch a criminal in Richmond with a gun in a crime, the criminal has forfeited his right to remain in this community, will face immediate federal prosecution and stiff mandatory federal prison sentences (often five years), and will thus be \"exiled\" to federal prison, often far away from the criminal's home town.\n\nIn 1997, the program was implemented in conjunction with an extensive public outreach and media campaign to educate citizens about lengthy federal prison sentences for gun crimes and to maximize deterrence. The message An Illegal Gun Gets You Five Years in Federal Prison was placed on 15 billboards, a fully painted city bus carried the message changing routes every day, TV commercials, Metro Richmond traffic reports, over a million supermarket bags were also used to advertise Project Exile. Rochester, NY became the second city to implement the plan in 1998 under the leadership of Mayor Bill Johnson.\n\nIn 2001, after the launch of a similar state program named Virginia Exile, Project Exile evolved from a federal-only program to a larger cooperative effort with state and local authorities meeting bimonthly to review ongoing arrests to determine in which venue to bring the case so as to ensure the maximum possible penalty. President George W. Bush made the program a part of his Project Safe Neighborhoods crime-prevention plan, which included increased funding for U.S. attorneys to prosecute gun crime.\n\nIn Congress, Project Exile had both supporters (such as Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, Sue Myrick of North Carolina, and Bob Ehrlich of Maryland) and opponents (such as Representatives Bobby Scott of Virginia and Maxine Waters of California).\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) and the Brady Campaign were both early and vocal supporters of Project Exile. The NRA lobbied the U.S. Congress to help secure $2.3 million for emulation of Exile in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Camden County, New Jersey, where similar firearms-related violence has plagued the communities. The NRA has remained a strong supporter of the program as its focus is on severely punishing all gun crimes especially illegal possession rather than by making gun purchases more difficult. NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre stated \"By prosecuting them they prevent the drug dealer, the gang member and the felon from committing the next crime... Leave the good people alone and lock up the bad people and dramatically cut crime.\"\n\nProject Exile was opposed by some gun-rights groups and some black leaders, the latter saying that it disproportionately affected African Americans. Families Against Mandatory Minimums also opposed the project.\n\nA \"Project Exile Condemnation Petition\" was launched by Brian Puckett of GunTruths.com, Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America, Angel Shamaya of KeepAndBearArms.com, and former NRA director Russ Howard. Other opponents who were members of this anti-Exile coalition included Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, the Law Enforcement Alliance of America, Libertarian Party presidential candidate Harry Browne, and science fiction writer L. Neil Smith.\n\nProject Exile was widely praised after its first year's results were released.\n\nWithin the first year (1997-1998) Project Exile resulted in:\n\nDuring the first year of Project Exile (1998), homicides in Richmond declined 33%, for the lowest number since 1987, and armed robberies declined 30%. In 1999, homicides declined another 21%. By 2007, homicides in Richmond were down to 57 compared to 122 in the year before Project Exile.\n\nResearch analysts offered different opinions as to the program's success in reducing gun crime. \n\nJens Ludwig and Steven Raphael, in a 2003 analysis of the program, argued that the decline in gun homicide was part of a general regression to the mean across U.S. cities with high homicide rates. A 2005 study by Richard Rosenfeld and others, published in \"Criminology & Public Policy\", disagreed, concluding that Richmond's gun homicide rate fell more rapidly than the rates in other large U.S. cities, when controlling for other variables.\n\nProject Exile, which was confined to Richmond and surrounding areas, has since been supplanted by Virginia Exile, the Commonwealth's statewide program which carries bail restrictions and imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in a Virginia prison for those who:\n\n\n\n"}

Lawler is best known for his 41-year tenure as the voice of the National Basketball Association's Los Angeles Clippers. Going back to the franchise's six-year stint in San Diego (1978–84), Lawler has broadcast virtually every Clippers game since the franchise moved from Buffalo, New York in 1978, whether it be radio and/or television. There were only two seasons when Lawler did not serve as the team's primary play-by-play broadcaster: 1981–82 (Jerry Gross) and 1984–85 (Eddie Doucette); Lawler returned as the full-time voice in 1985–86. In 2019, Lawler was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nAlthough the Clippers have been among the least successful NBA franchises, Lawler would provide Clippers fans with his enthusiastic commentary, which has made him a fan favorite. He has broadcast more than 3,000 Clippers games, including more than 1,600 consecutive games. He reached the 2,500-game milestone in a game versus the Boston Celtics, on February 26, 2011. Lawler reached the 3,000-game milestone on December 10, 2016 versus the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nLawler was born in Ohio and raised in Peoria, Illinois. His broadcasting career began in the 1960s upon graduating from Bradley University in his hometown. Lawler initially worked as a sports announcer at 1440 KPRO in Riverside, California and did some announcing at the Riverside International Raceway nearby. From there, Lawler went on to work in Philadelphia, where he broadcast games for the Flyers of the National Hockey League, the 76ers of the National Basketball Association, the Phillies of Major League Baseball, Big 5 college basketball, and Temple college football. He also worked as a sports reporter for then-CBS station WCAU-TV, before returning to Southern California for good in the late 1970s, calling the San Diego Conquistadors of the American Basketball Association and the San Diego Chargers of the National Football League.\n\nLawler has worked with Basketball Hall of Famer and current ESPN/ABC commentator Bill Walton, on locally televised Clippers broadcasts. Their broadcasts were wildly popular among Clippers (and many NBA) fans, because of their witty banter. Walton left the Clippers to work exclusively with ABC/ESPN when the two networks acquired the NBA broadcasts in 2002. Lawler's biggest broadcasting influences included Irv Kaze, a former sports executive (who had a stint as a San Diego Clippers general manager and hired Lawler in 1978) and long-time Los Angeles-area sports talk show host, before he died in 2003; and Los Angeles Lakers voice, Chick Hearn, who like Lawler, grew up in Illinois before moving on to Southern California. Lawler and former Clippers guard Shaun Livingston are alumni of Peoria (Central) High School. Lawler had previously worked on Clippers telecasts on Prime Ticket/Fox Sports West alongside former Clipper player and former color analyst, Mike Smith, over 15 seasons from 2002 to 2017. He worked alongside former San Antonio Spurs player Bruce Bowen, during the 2017/18 season.\n\nUnlike other announcers who use headsets while calling the game, Lawler relies exclusively on a handheld microphone during games. His reasoning for it is because he feels he has \"much more control over the microphone by holding it.\" He also added \"I've been doing it so long that if I wear a headset, I don't know what to do with my hands.\"\n\nLawler and his wife, Jo, have three grown children and seven grandchildren.\n\nOn March 3, 2016, Lawler was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Clippers coach Doc Rivers and several players attended the ceremony.\n\nOn September 12, 2018, Lawler announced he would retire at the end of the 2018-19 season. He has missed only three games in his 40-year career.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Lawler was named the 2019 winner of the Curt Gowdy Media Award for electronic media by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n\n"}

Although all ampakines are AMPAR PAMs, not all AMPAR PAMs are ampakines.\n\nThey are currently being investigated as potential treatment for a range of conditions involving mental disability and disturbances such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) or neurological disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), among others.\n\nMore recently developed ampakine compounds are much more potent and selective for the AMPA receptor target, and while none of the newer selective ampakine compounds have yet come onto the market, various ampakines are in clinical trials.\n\nA wide range of ampakines have been developed by RespireRx, which hold patents covering most medical uses of this class of drugs. The best known compounds that have come out of the RespireRx drug development program are CX-516 (Ampalex), CX-546, CX-614, CX-691 (farampator), and CX-717. ORG-26576 was developed by RespireRx but then licensed to Organon for development.\n\nSeveral other compounds such as CX-701, CX-1739, CX-1763 and CX-1837 have also been announced as being under current investigation, and while little information has yet been released about them, CX-1739 is believed to be the most potent compound in this class to date, reportedly some 5x the potency of CX-717.\n\nPresently, CX717 is in phase II clinical trials as a possible non-stimulant pharmacotherapy in the treatment of ADHD. As the AMPA receptors also mediate respiratory drive, CX717 is also being investigated as a therapy in opioid-induced respiratory depression and spinal-cord injury.\n\nAmpakines work by allosterically binding to a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor, called AMPA receptors.\n\nThe ampakines are mostly low-impact AMPAR PAMs, though with some exceptions, such as tulrampator (S-47445, CX-1632).\n\nFew side effects have been determined, but an ampakine called farampator (CX-691) has side effects including headache, drowsiness, nausea, and impaired episodic memory.\n\nAn ampakine called CX456 has been proposed as a treatment for Rett syndrome, after favorable testing in an animal model.\n\nAmpakines have been investigated by DARPA for potential use in increasing military effectiveness.\n\n\n\n"}

The episode was first broadcast on BBC One on 11 June 2005. It is the first of a two-part story. The concluding episode, \"The Parting of the Ways\", was first broadcast on 18 June 2005.\n\nIn the episode, set 100 years after the events of the 2005 episode \"The Long Game\", the alien time traveller the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his travelling companions Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) are secretly brought on board the game show broadcasting satellite Satellite Five by its controller (Martha Cope), so they can fight against the controller's \"masters\", the Dalek race.\n\nThe Ninth Doctor, Rose, and Jack find themselves separated, waking up with temporary amnesia in various television game shows which are more fatal than their twenty-first century counterparts. On \"The Weakest Link\" and \"Big Brother\", losing contestants are disintegrated. On \"What Not to Wear\", participants undergo brutal cosmetic surgery. The Doctor escapes \"Big Brother\" with a contestant called Lynda, and Jack escapes \"What Not to Wear\". The Doctor discovers that they are on the space station Satellite Five in the year 200,100. The station is now under the control of the Bad Wolf Corporation, which shares the name with a set of words that are following the Doctor and Rose through time and space. Lynda explains that 100 years ago, when the Doctor last visited, Satellite Five stopped broadcasting and humanity became confused and lost. The three search for Rose. They find her just as she loses the final round of \"The Weakest Link\" and is promptly disintegrated by the Anne Droid.\n\nThe Doctor, Jack, and Lynda are arrested, but escape their capture and travel to the control room on Floor 500. There they meet the Controller, a cybernetic human. The Controller uses the cover of a solar flare to speak directly to the Doctor, telling him that her masters cannot hear her during the flare. The Controller used a teleport called a transmat to hide the Doctor and his companions in the games as her masters do not watch them. The solar flare ends before she can tell the Doctor who is controlling her. Jack finds the TARDIS hidden in a restricted area, which he uses to figure out that contest losers are not actually disintegrated but transmatted off the station. The Controller begins giving the Doctor the coordinates that the transmat leads to, knowing that her masters will hear. The Controller disappears in a transmat beam and wakes up on a spaceship, where she is killed by her masters. Rose wakes up on the floor of a spaceship and is horrified to see a Dalek approaching her. The Doctor and Jack discover a signal coming from the station that is hiding something at the edge of the solar system. They cancel the signal and reveal a fleet of Dalek spaceships. The Daleks open a communication channel to the Doctor, threatening to kill Rose if he interferes. The Doctor refuses to back down and vows to rescue Rose and wipe out the Daleks.\n\nThe term \"Bad Wolf\" appears in every episode of the first series except for \"Rose\" and the two-part stories which only have one explicit reference between the two episodes.\n\nA working title for the episode was \"Gameshow World\". It was the last of the 2005 \"Doctor Who\" episode titles to be revealed. Prior to this, the episode was referred to in promotional literature as \"The Parting of the Ways (Part 1)\", with \"Part 2\" eventually becoming simply \"The Parting of the Ways\".\n\nThe concept of the Anne Droid and a futuristic version of \"The Weakest Link\" was pitched by Russell T Davies in his second meeting with the BBC about bringing back \"Doctor Who\" in 2000 or 2001. The idea had come from his trip to New York City for the launch of the American version of \"Queer as Folk\", where he had seen \"a vast screen in Times Square with a gigantic Anne Robinson blasting us tiny mortals with her voice\".\n\nThe production team originally intended to show Jack's naked buttocks on screen. The scene was shot, but the BBC's editorial policy department stepped in and vetoed it, the only time they over-ruled the production team during the 2005 series. According to the DVD commentary for this episode, the music that is heard as the Dalek fleet is revealed includes a chorus singing \"What is happening?\" (transliterated: Mah Kor'ei) in Hebrew.\n\nRussell T Davies mentioned that the \"arc word\" for the subsequent series was mentioned in this series, as well as being an anagram. One of the answers during \"The Weakest Link\" scenes was that the Great Cobalt Pyramid was built on the ruins of the famous Old Earth Torchwood Institute, \"Torchwood\" being an anagram of \"Doctor Who\". In 2006, a spin-off series titled \"Torchwood\" began, set in modern-day Cardiff and involving a team investigating paranormal and alien incidents, and featuring John Barrowman reprising his role of Captain Jack Harkness.\n\nNisha Nayar, the actress cast as the Female Programmer in this episode, previously appeared as one of the uncredited 'Red Kang' extras in the 1987 classic series story \"Paradise Towers\". This made her the second actor to appear in both the classic and new series of \"Doctor Who\", following William Thomas's appearance in the previous episode, \"Boom Town\". Martha Cope later played Captain Oswin in the audio play \"The Nowhere Place\" and Talia in \"Bedtime Story\". Paterson Joseph later played Victor Espinoza in the audio play \"Earth Aid\". Sebastian Armesto later played Anders in the audio play \"Grand Theft Cosmos\".\n\nAccording to \"Doctor Who Confidential\", although Anne Robinson was invited to voice the Anne Droid, the expectation was that she would decline. A celebrity voice impersonator had already been hired to record the lines when Robinson accepted.\n\nThe episode received final rating of 6.81 million viewers, the lowest figure of the series. The episode received an Audience Appreciation Index score of 86.\n\nDigital Spy's Dek Hogan had a positive reaction to \"Bad Wolf\", praising Eccleston, the parodies, and the Susanna and Trinny robots. Alasdair Wilkins of io9 praised the \"mad energy\" to the finale and Eccleston's emotion over losing Rose. However, he was critical of the popular culture references, feeling that it would not age well and he could not find a \"coherent satirical point in their inclusion\". \"SFX\" gave \"Bad Wolf\" a score of nine out of ten, calling the two-parter Davies' \"finest work this season\", praising the humorous parodies and the reveal of the Daleks. The episode's cliffhanger has been singled out by critics. It was listed by Charlie Jane Anders of io9 among the greatest cliffhangers of the programme, while Den of Geek's Mark Harrison listed it as the Ninth Doctor's best cliffhanger. It was also chosen by Morgan Jeffery and Chris Allen of Digital Spy among the five best \"Doctor Who\" cliffhangers; Jeffery wrote that it \"isn't the strongest episode of his tenure – let's not forget the Trinny and Susannah robots – but you'd be hard-pressed to fault the climax\".\n\n"}

It is part of the ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) group, owned by ThyssenKrupp. The Howaldtswerke shipyard was founded in Kiel in 1838 and merged with Hamburg-based Deutsche Werft to form Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) in 1968. The company's shipyard was formerly used by Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft until the end of World War II.\n\nHDW was founded October 1, 1838 in Kiel by engineer August Howaldt and entrepreneur Johann Schweffel under the name \"Maschinenbauanstalt und Eisengießerei Schweffel & Howaldt\" (Machine Factory and Iron Foundry Schweffel & Howaldt), initially building boilers.\n\nThe first steam engine for naval purposes was built in 1849 for the Von der Tann, a gunboat for the small navy of Schleswig-Holstein. In 1850, the company built an early submarine, \"Brandtaucher\", designed by Wilhelm Bauer. It had been intended to build the boat in Rendsburg but Danish forces advanced too close during the First Schleswig War, so construction was moved to Kiel.\n\nThe first ship built under the company's new name \"Howaldtswerke\" was a small steamer, named \"Vorwärts\", built in 1865. Business expanded rapidly as Germany became a maritime power and, by the start of the 20th century, around 390 ships had been completed.\n\nIn 1892 the company started a subsidiary in Austrian-Hungarian Fiume on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. The subsidiary closed ten years later but the yard remains open under the name 3. Maj.\n\nWith Kiel being one of the two main bases of the Kaiserliche Marine, the shipyard also benefited much from navy maintenance, repair and construction contracts. During World War I the company also built a number of U-boats. By 1937, the company had yards in Kiel and in Hamburg, and was taken over by the Kriegsmarine. During World War II, Howaldtswerke built 33 VIIC U-boats in Hamburg and 31 in Kiel.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, Howaldtswerke was the only major shipyard in Kiel that was not dismantled. The yard flourished during the \"economic miracle\" of the 1960s, with the construction of freighters and tankers, and again expanded by opening a shipyard in Hamburg. Howaldtswerke merged with Deutsche Werft in Hamburg in 1968, and the company took the new name \"Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft\" (HDW). Pressure from cheaper competitors in Japan and South Korea caused the closure of the Hamburg yard in 1985.\n\nIn March 2002, the American financial investor One Equity Partner (OEP) took over the majority of Babcock AG at HDW. Shortly after that, Babcock AG had to file for insolvency and called for a reserved transaction, but the OEP was able to avoid this.\n\nIn January 2005, HDW became a subsidiary of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), which also part-owned Kockums of Malmö, Sweden and 24.9% of Hellenic Shipyards Co. of Skaramangas, Greece. The group employs around 6,600 workers. In 2009, HDW worked with Kockums and Northrop Grumman to offer a Visby class corvette derivative in the American Focused Mission Vessel Study, a precursor to the Littoral combat ship program.\n\nIn July 2011, TKMS announced that it has confirmed an existing deal to sell the civilian shipbuilding assets of HDW Gaarden to Abu Dhabi MAR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was twice President of Chile, from 1841 to 1846 and from 1846 to 1851.\n\nBorn in Concepción, he served as the president of Chile between 1841 and 1851. At the age of 16 he was imprisoned as a revolutionary by the Spanish authorities, but was soon released, and in 1818 joined the army of San Martin under whom he served as colonel throughout the Chilean War of Independence. After three years of continuous warfare (1820–23), he accomplished the temporary conquest of the Araucanian Indians. He was appointed brigadier general in 1831. In 1832 he crossed the Cordillera and defeated decisively the Pincheira brothers in the battle of Epulafquén. Then Bulnes commanded the Chilean army in 1838 against Gen. Santa Cruz in Peru; and, after taking Lima and winning the battles of Huaraz and Puente del Buin, combined his forces with those of Gamarra and defeated Santa Cruz at the Battle of Yungay (January 19, 1839), thus putting an end to the confederation between Peru and Bolivia.\n\nHis presidencies were characterised by educational and cultural expansion, supported by the encouragement of foreign intellectuals to come to Chile. The National Institute was reformed and several junior schools were established along with the . In Santiago the University of Chile was founded during his watch, in 1842, as well as a technical training school from which the University of Santiago is descended.\n\nBulnes also presided over a general amnesty in order to reconcile the groups who had opposed one another in the Civil War of 1829.\n\nRegarding the nation's strategic goals, Bulnes founded Fuerte Bulnes in 1843 in order to establish and enforce sovereignty over the Magellan Straits. The settlement was relocated to Punta Arenas six years later because the original site offered insufficient space for the development of a settled community: it was and remains the most southerly municipality in the world, and has been a focus for economic development in the south of the country. Germans were targeted to colonise the hitherto very sparsely inhabited southern part of Chile in the wake of the 1848 revolutions which provided an impetus for emigration from the European perspective.\n\nIt was also during the presidency of Bulnes that the former colonial power, Spain, acknowledged the independence of Chile and became involved in the construction of Chile's first railway.\n\nManuel Bulnes Prieto died in Santiago.\n\n"}

Les Insus? were composed of Aubert, Bertignac and Kolinka but with the bassist Corine Marienneau replaced on the bass guitar by Aleksander Angelov (hence the reason they were not able to use the name \"Téléphone\").

{"id": "1851123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851123", "title": "KPHO-TV", "text": "KPHO-TV\n\nKPHO-TV, virtual channel 5 (UHF digital channel 17), is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Phoenix, Arizona, United States. The station is owned by the Meredith Local Media subsidiary of Des Moines, Iowa-based Meredith Corporation, as part of a duopoly with independent station KTVK (channel 3). The two stations share studios on North Seventh Avenue in Uptown Phoenix; KPHO's transmitter is located on South Mountain on the city's south side. KPHO extends its signal throughout northern Arizona by way of more than a dozen translators.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on December 4, 1949 as the first television station in Arizona. It was originally owned by a group of entrepreneurs—one of whom, John Mullins, would later launch KBTV (now KUSA) in Denver. Majority interest was held by Phoenix Broadcasting, owners of KPHO radio (910 AM, now KFYI at 550 AM); the television station, which was originally assigned the call letters KTLX, had its callsign changed to KPHO-TV to match its radio sister shortly before its debut. It originally broadcast from studios at the Hotel Westward Ho in downtown Phoenix. The Meredith Corporation purchased the KPHO stations on June 25, 1952. In April 1950, the Lew King Ranger children's show broadcast live on KPHO with a young Wayne Newton as announcer. In 1954, it began airing \"The Wallace and Ladmo Show\", a children's program which aired weekday mornings until 1989—one of the longest-running locally produced children's shows in television history.\n\nAs the only television station in Phoenix during the first 3½ years of operation, it carried programming from all four networks of the time: it was a primary CBS affiliate, and had secondary affiliations with NBC, ABC and the now-defunct DuMont Television Network. NBC programming moved to KTYL-TV (channel 12, now KPNX) when it signed on April 1953, followed by CBS when KOOL-TV (channel 10, now KSAZ-TV) signed on in October. KPHO remained a dual ABC/DuMont affiliate (with ABC programming shared between KPHO-TV and KOOL-TV) until February 1955, when KTVK (channel 3) signed on and took the ABC affiliation full-time.\n\nChannel 5 became an independent station when the DuMont network ceased operations in 1956. During the late 1950s, the station was briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network. As an independent station, channel 5 programmed a schedule of movies and off-network series, along with local newscasts. KPHO-TV was separated from its sister station when Meredith sold KPHO radio in 1972. That same year, channel 5's operations moved to a facility on Black Canyon Highway. During the 1970s, KPHO became a regional superstation that was available on cable television in much of Arizona and New Mexico, as well as parts of California, Utah and Nevada.\n\nKPHO-TV was the sole English-language independent station in Phoenix until 1979, when KNXV-TV (channel 15) signed on with a general entertainment format during the day and subscription-based service ONTV at night (KNXV became a full-time general entertainment station by 1983). Even though channel 5 was the leading independent in the market, the upstart Fox Broadcasting Company opted to affiliate with channel 15 in 1986 after the E. W. Scripps Company purchased the station, promising to upgrade its syndicated programming and to launch a newscast (KPHO's other sister stations, KVVU-TV in Las Vegas and WOFL in Orlando landed affiliations with Fox upon its October 1986 launch, with the latter now owned by the network outright). Although it never did begin a newscast until the final months of its tenure with Fox in 1994, landing the Fox affiliation made KNXV a very strong competitor against KPHO. Early in 1994, KPHO signed a verbal agreement—but not a contractual one—with The WB, which was set to launch the following year in January 1995.\n\nOn May 23, 1994, New World Communications signed an agreement with Fox to convert twelve of its stations to the network, resulting in a massive wave of affiliation switches throughout the country; locally, KSAZ-TV—which New World was in the process of acquiring from Citicasters – was included in the deal. CBS then sought to find a new Phoenix area affiliate. It briefly wooed KTVK, but its locally based owners, the McFarland-Lewis family, turned the offer down in hopes of renewing its contract with ABC. KPNX was eliminated after the Gannett Company signed an affiliation deal with NBC that renewed the network's affiliation with that station and its sister stations in Atlanta, Jacksonville, and Minneapolis–St. Paul (which would ultimately result in a major affiliation switch in Denver the following year). CBS then approached KPHO, since it was the only area station not affiliated with a Big Three network that had a functioning news department. On June 30, 1994, CBS agreed to a long-term contract with Meredith, allowing KPHO to rejoin the network after losing the CBS affiliation 42 years earlier to channel 10. The centerpiece of the deal was a renewal of CBS' affiliation with Meredith's Kansas City station, KCTV; it also called for another of KPHO's sister stations, NBC affiliate WNEM-TV in Bay City, Michigan, to join CBS. The ABC affiliation eventually went to KNXV when Scripps cut an affiliation deal which called for three of that company's stations to switch to ABC from other networks; KTVK replaced KPHO as the Valley's leading independent affiliation in September 1995 after an eight-month affiliation with The WB. Phoenix was one of just four television markets where the CBS affiliation moved from one VHF station to another during the affiliation switches spurred by Fox's deal with New World Communications.\n\nCBS officially returned to KPHO on September 12, 1994, three days after New World's purchase of KSAZ-TV—which became an independent before affiliating with Fox three months later—was finalized. Initially, channel 5 continued to run a couple of cartoons and a moderate amount of sitcoms during non-network hours. By January 1995, the station began taking on the look of a major-network affiliate as the syndicated cartoons disappeared from the schedule; the station then gradually added more newscasts, talk and reality shows. The sitcoms were phased out and moved to KTVK, KUTP (channel 45), and upstart KASW (channel 61). KPHO has generally been one of CBS' weaker affiliates since the 1994 switch, due in large part to the station's lack of a strong syndicated programming inventory. However, its 10 p.m. newscast led among Phoenix's English-language stations in total households during the November 2009 sweeps period. In stark contrast, channel 10 had been one of CBS' strongest affiliates and was at a strong second place in total day viewership at the time of the switch.\n\nIn 2014, Meredith Corporation acquired KTVK, making it a sister station. On August 7, 2014, Meredith announced plans to merge the two stations' operations at KTVK's studio in the Central Avenue Corridor, citing its significantly larger size in comparison to KPHO's current facilities.\n\nOn September 8, 2015, it was announced that Media General would acquire Meredith Corporation in a cash and stock deal valued at $2.4 billion. The deal was expected to be consummated in June 2016. The combined company was to operate under the name Meredith Media General. This would have been the first change in ownership for KPHO in 63 years. However, on January 27, 2016, Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Media General and that Meredith agreed to termination of its merger agreement with Media General.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn December 20, 2006, KPHO began broadcasting a local weather multicast service called CBS 5 Weather Now on digital subchannel 5.2, broadcasting 24 hours a day. The service was automated through the station's weather computer and was carried on select cable systems in the Phoenix market. The service was active until the first quarter of 2015 and bucked the trend of many broadcast television stations using their subchannel bandwidth for entertainment multicast networks in the presence of multiple sources of weather information, including smartphone applications. However, the service was dropped and replaced with Cozi TV in April 2015. The service was then moved to sister station KTVK on their digital subchannel 3.3, starting April 13, 2015.\n\nKPHO-TV formerly operated a third digital subchannel for use as an overflow game feed during the early rounds of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. The station's analog channel 5 would break from the 5.1 digital channel in order to run coverage of four different games simultaneously. In 2008, when CBS restricted stations to only one multicast feed, the station aired the additional game over KPHO-DT2. The need for stations to multicast games ended in 2011, as CBS and the Turner Broadcasting System's TBS, TNT and TruTV began sharing the broadcast rights to the tournament.\n\nKPHO-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, at 11:59 p.m. on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 17. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 5.\n\nAs part of the SAFER Act, KPHO kept its analog signal on the air until July 12 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.\n\nAs a CBS affiliate, KPHO-TV currently airs two of the network's programs out of pattern: due to its hour-long local newscast at 5 p.m., the station runs the \"CBS Evening News\" at 6 p.m., a half-hour later than the network's recommended 5:30 p.m. timeslot for the program in the Mountain Time Zone. The station also airs \"The Price Is Right\" at 9 a.m., one hour earlier than CBS' recommended timeslot for the game show.\n\nIn addition to the CBS network schedule, syndicated programming featured on KPHO includes \"Inside Edition\", \"Dr. Phil\" (both of which also air on KTVK), \"The People's Court\", and \"Person of Interest\", among others. The station used to produce \"Better Arizona\", a daily lifestyle program which features locally produced segments interspersed with segments from the national \"Better\" program that is produced and syndicated by Meredith, but was canceled in 2015.\n\nSports programming on KPHO includes select Arizona Cardinals games through the \"NFL on CBS\", primarily home contests where an American Football Conference team is the opponent. Channel 5 also carries CBS' broadcast of the PGA Tour's Phoenix Open held at TPC Scottsdale every February (because the golf tournament is played on Super Bowl weekend, coverage will shift to KPNX in years when CBS has the Super Bowl). Also, any Arizona State Sun Devils and Arizona Wildcats appearances in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament picked up by CBS will air on the station.\n\nKPHO-TV presently broadcasts 28 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five hours each weekday, two hours on Saturdays and one hour on Sundays); unlike most CBS affiliates within the top 50 television markets, KPHO-TV does not carry local newscasts on weekend mornings. Atypical for CBS stations located outside of the Pacific and Eastern Time Zones, KPHO runs its weeknight 5 p.m. newscast for one hour; it is also the largest (as well as one of the few) CBS affiliates in the country that does not air a 6 p.m. newscast on Monday through Friday evenings, in addition to having a 5 p.m. newscast; KPHO broadcasts the \"CBS Evening News\" in that timeslot instead (in contrast, KPNX and KNXV air their respective networks' evening news programs at 5:30 p.m.).\n\nKPHO-TV has operated a news department since it signed on. When it became independent in 1956, it was one of the few independents of the time with a functioning news department. By the 1960s, the station ran its late evening newscast at 9 p.m., becoming the first primetime newscast in Arizona (years before KSAZ launched its own 9 p.m. newscast as a Fox station). By the late 1980s, the station ran two newscasts a day: a midday newscast at 11:30 a.m. on weekdays and a nightly primetime newscast at 9:30 p.m., this program expanded a half-hour earlier to 9 p.m. by the fall of 1994.\n\nWhen KPHO reassumed the CBS affiliation in December 1994, the station gradually expanded its news programming with newscasts being added at 5 and 6 p.m. each weeknight; its midday and late evening newscasts were respectively moved a half-hour later to noon and 10 p.m. The 10 p.m. newscast by 1995 only aired for five minutes (which expanded to eight minutes by 1997) on weeknights, followed by a \"Seinfeld\" rerun; on January 1, 2001, KPHO expanded the newscast to the standard 35-minute timeslot, which had already been the length of the station's weekend 10 p.m. newscasts. By 1996, KPHO had added a weekday morning newscast; this program later expanded to 4:30 a.m. (almost a decade before it became commonplace for stations to expand their weekday morning newscasts into that timeslot), the program's start time was reduced to 5 a.m. on January 1, 2001.\n\nOn March 1, 2009, KPHO-TV began sharing a news helicopter as part of an agreement with KTVK and KPNX. The helicopter is operated by Helicopters Inc. and is branded as \"News Chopper 20\", a combination of the over-the-air virtual channel numbers of the three stations—3, 5 and 12. On March 14, 2009, KPHO became the fourth television station in the Phoenix market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.\n\nOn May 8, 2009, KPHO-TV entered into a second agreement to share newsgathering resources, when it partnered with KSAZ-TV and KNXV-TV to join a Local News Service agreement that was originally formed between the two stations' respective owners Fox Television Stations and the E. W. Scripps Company on April 1, 2009 involving stations owned by those companies in Phoenix, Detroit and Tampa. The service allows the pooling of newsgathering efforts for local news events and each station provides employees to the pool service in exchange for the sharing of video.\n\n\n\nKPHO is rebroadcast on the following translator stations:\n\n"}
{"id": "1851129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851129", "title": "José Joaquín Prieto", "text": "José Joaquín Prieto\n\nJosé Joaquín Prieto Vial (; August 20, 1786 – November 22, 1854) was a Chilean military and political figure. He was twice President of Chile between 1831 and 1841. José Joaquín Prieto was of Spanish and Basque descent.\n\nPrieto was one of five sons of a Creole officer in Concepción. After finishing school, he joined the cavalry garrison in his home town. In 1810, he joined the Chilean fight for independence against his father's will. He met Manuela Warnes García de Zúñiga in Buenos Aires and married her in 1812. During the Chilean War of Independence, he served as a captain. In the dispute between Bernardo O'Higgins and José Miguel Carrera, he took the side of O'Higgins, who then made him Quartermaster general of the southern army.\n\nAfter the defeat in the Battle of Rancagua, which he wasn't a part of, Prieto fled to Mendoza, Argentina to build up the Liberation Army of the Andes. After the victory of the Chileans in the battle of Chacabuco in 1817, in which he also wasn't involved, he was appointed Commanding General of Santiago, where he dealt with defense strategies and military matters. Then, he turned his attention to Peru, in order to support its fight for independence.\n\nHis military accomplishments - especially in the south of the country - earned the respect of conservative-centralist circles, which encouraged him to start a political career. He did so in 1823; in this year he was elected into the Chilean House of Deputies and appointed into State council. In this position, he advocated a strong and influential central government and fought the federalist independence ambitions of the regionalists. In 1828, he was elected vice-president of Chile.\n\nPrieto's military career continued to progress. In 1828, he was promoted to general and commander of the army in the south. In 1829 presidential elections, neither he nor his liberal-federalist opponent Joaquín Vicuña received an absolute majority. The liberal majority in Congress nominated Francisco Ramón Vicuña, president of the senate, as vice-president. The conservatives considered this move to be unconstitutional and started a civil war.\n\nAs commander of the southern army, Prieto Vial marched onto Santiago. On December 14, 1829, he and his troops met the liberal army under Francisco de la Lastra and defeated them at the Battle of Ochagavía. Then, in 1830, an agreement was finally found after the defeat of Ramón Freire at the Battle of Lircay.\n\nAfter the transitional president José Tomás Ovalle died, Fernando Errázuriz Aldunate became \"Provisional President\" from March 8 to March 31, 1831, rapidly replaced by Prieto himself on April 10. On September 18, 1831, Prieto was finally able to take over the job as elected President for a first term of five years.\n\nHis main focus on first taking power was to restore law and order; for that he relied on Diego Portales, who continue to be the almost universal minister and provided the necessary political stability for the country to recover from the decade of anarchy. He also instructed Manuel Bulnes to seize the bandits commanded by the brothers Pablo and José Antonio Pincheira who made the area around Concepción unsafe. On May 25, 1833 a new constitution was passed, which - with a few amendments - would be valid until 1925. It provided for a 5-year long term of office for the president, who could be re-elected only once. The president received much authority.\n\nDuring his 10-year-long presidency, Prieto expanded the governmental power and laid the foundation for a public administration in Chile. The first educational establishments like the \"Instituto Nacional\" were founded and in 1837 the ministries for justice and public education were created. Prieto's foreign policy was dominated by Chile's war with Peru between 1836 and 1839. The Chilean army under Manuel Blanco Encalada suffered heavy losses, which climaxed in the Treaty of Paucarpata, following which Manuel Bulnes took over the leadership of the army and led it into the victorious Battle of Yungay.\n\nIn 1841, the victorious hero Bulnes was elected as the successor of Prieto. After his resignation Prieto served as Senator until 1852 and even took over the command of the infantry and the navy of Valparaíso until 1846. In 1846, he moved to Santiago de Chile, where he died on November 22, 1854 at the age of 68.\n\n"}
{"id": "1851137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851137", "title": "The Parting of the Ways", "text": "The Parting of the Ways\n\n\"The Parting of the Ways\" is the thirteenth episode of the revived first series of the British science fiction television programme \"Doctor Who\". The episode was first broadcast on BBC One on 18 June 2005. It was the second episode of the two-part story. The first part, \"Bad Wolf\", was broadcast on 11 June.\n\nIn the episode, the Dalek race invades the human satellite Satellite Five in the year 200,100, intending to make more Daleks by harvesting dead humans. The alien time traveller the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) uses the satellite's transmitter to try to destroy every Dalek, while at the same time sending his travelling companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) home to keep her safe.\n\nThe episode featured Christopher Eccleston making his last appearance as the Ninth Doctor and marks the first appearance of David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. \n\nThe Ninth Doctor uses the extrapolator on the TARDIS to generate a protective shield around it as he materialises the TARDIS around Rose to rescue her from the Daleks. The Doctor discovers the Daleks' Emperor survived the Time War and escaped to Earth in a crippled ship, where he rebuilt the Dalek race by harvesting DNA material from humanity.\n\nReturning to the space station Satellite Five, Jack uses the extrapolator to shield the top six floors of the station and sets up defensive positions. The Doctor attempts to create a delta wave generator which will kill the Daleks, but will also destroy life on Earth. The Doctor tricks Rose into going inside the TARDIS, and uses his sonic screwdriver to direct the TARDIS to return Rose to her home time to keep her safe. The Daleks invade the station, killing everyone in their path.\n\nAfter being returned home, Rose begins to notice the words \"Bad Wolf\" - words which also exist on Satellite Five - and realises that they are a message rather than a warning. She convinces Mickey and Jackie to help her try to open the heart of the TARDIS. Mickey uses a truck borrowed by Jackie to pull the panel on the console open and Rose is bathed in the light of the TARDIS. The TARDIS doors slam on Mickey and Jackie as they try to enter, and it then dematerialises.\n\nThe Daleks get to the top of Satellite Five, killing Jack and Lynda in the process. They file into the control room while the Doctor contemplates firing the delta wave, eventually deciding he can't do it. Before the Daleks can kill the Doctor, Rose arrives in the TARDIS, wrapped in the glow of the time vortex. She reveals that she is the Bad Wolf. She spreads the words “Bad Wolf” throughout time and space as a message to lead her there. Rose disintegrates the Dalek fleet. The Doctor begs her to relinquish her new power, but instead she brings Jack back to life. Rose begins to suffer the effects of the power and the Doctor kisses her, absorbing the entire power of the vortex into his own body to save her life. He releases it back into the TARDIS and carries an unconscious Rose back inside. They leave in the TARDIS before Jack can get back to them. As a result of absorbing the time vortex, every cell in the Doctor's body begins to die. He then regenerates into the Tenth Doctor.\n\nThis was the first episode in this series which was not given a press screening prior to the broadcast. \"Radio Times\" stated, \"No preview tape was available for this episode.\" The episode was, however, screened for BAFTA on 15 June 2005.\n\nAccording to Russell T Davies in \"Doctor Who Magazine\", Jack was left behind because they wanted to explore the effects of the regeneration on Rose (noting that Jack would have taken the regeneration \"in his stride\"). Jack returned in the \"Doctor Who\" spin-off series \"Torchwood\", which began broadcasting in October 2006. In an interview in \"Doctor Who Magazine\", Russell T Davies stated that an alternate ending for this episode was written and filmed, with the intention that it would be shown to press previewers to hide the secret of the regeneration. The \"false\" ending would have featured similar dialogue to the televised final scene, but the TARDIS would have scanned Rose and the viewers would have seen the display read: \"LIFEFORM DYING\". Davies considered this scene inferior to the one actually shown but suggested that it might be suitable as an extra on a DVD someday. On the DVD commentary, executive producer Julie Gardner and Billie Piper briefly discuss this ending, which Gardner describes as featuring Rose's death; unlike Davies, Gardner expresses doubts that it will be issued on DVD (it was not included in the Series 1 DVD set). \n\nDavid Tennant's portion of the regeneration scene was actually filmed much later than Eccleston's and without the presence of Billie Piper. Tennant's segment was recorded with him speaking to a piece of sticky tape indicating Piper's eyeline and then edited into the broadcast version. It was recorded on 21 April 2005.\n\nThe Doctor claims that he is known in Dalek legend as \"the Oncoming Storm\", a title that first appeared in the Virgin New Adventures novel \"Love and War\" by Paul Cornell (who wrote the episode \"Father's Day\"). In the novel, the title was applied to the Doctor by the Draconians.\n\nEccleston's planned departure was leaked early by the BBC on 30 March 2005. They claimed that he was scared of being typecast. On 4 April, they admitted that this statement had been made without consulting the actor, and were forced to apologise. In 2010, Eccleston denied the typecast claim, explaining that he was not comfortable in the working environment. He later stated that he could not get along with some of the \"senior people\". According to the \"Sunday Mirror\", an interview for BBC's \"Doctor Who\" website that was taken down after his departure was announced revealed that Eccleston had planned to stay for two or three more years. Tennant was offered to replace the role when he was watching a pre-transmission copy of \"Casanova\" with Davies and Gardner. Though Tennant initially believed the offer was a joke, he accepted the role after he realised they were serious and was announced as Eccleston's replacement on 16 April 2005.\n\n\"The Parting of the Ways\" received overnight ratings of 6.2 million viewers, a 42% audience share and the most-watched programme of the night. When final consolidated ratings were calculated, figures rose to 6.91 million. The episode was broadcast in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel on 9 June 2006. The episode received an Audience Appreciation Index score of 89.\n\nDigital Spy's Dek Hogan wrote that the finale was \"something of an anti climax\", with the Bad Wolf resolution being a \"let down\" and the regeneration \"a bit rushed\" and \"lacking in the sort of emotional tension that has been one of this series hallmarks\". \"SFX\" gave \"The Parting of the Ways\" a score of nine out of ten, calling the two-parter Davies' \"finest work this season\", especially praising the emotional moments. However, he felt that two aspects of \"The Parting of the Ways\" let the story down: the Bad Wolf resolution and the deus ex machina of Rose's transformation. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times praised the episode, stating that it was \"inventive, gripping entertainment\" and that \"for the first time, Doctor Who has a proper, exhilarating season finale.\" Alasdair Wilkins of io9 praised the \"mad energy\" of the two-parter but felt the Dalek plan was \"convoluted and a whole bunch of seemingly important stuff ... is brushed aside in the rush to the Doctor's big moral dilemma\". Wilkins also pointed out that the story had to deal with Eccleston's abrupt departure, and as a result there was little thematic build-up and the regeneration feels \"bolted on to the rest of the story\". Despite this, Wilkins ranked it the best regeneration and the third best regeneration story (as of 2010).\n\n"}

The list of items, usually over 300 items long, encompasses cryptograms, competitions, build challenges, a 3 course meal, and a road trip. \"Scav Hunt\" is well known for its quirky, strange, and impossible items. Scav held the Guinness World Record for largest scavenger hunt from 2011 to 2014.\n\nThe Scavenger Hunt is held annually over four days in May, such that the final day's judgement of items is on Mother's Day.\n\n\"The Hunt\" begins ceremoniously at midnight of the Wednesday preceding Mother's Day weekend, with an event known as \"List Release.\" The ceremony surrounding the unveiling of the list usually begins a few hours before midnight, as teams slowly assemble on the ground floor of Ida Noyes Hall. These teams (ranging in size from 1 to over 250 each) then participate in what has been described as collective effervescence, as they chant various team-based and humorous slogans, eventually coalescing into a repeated \"we want the list\". Then, at midnight, the judges (members of the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt Organizing Committee) run into the center of this gathering, and announce that year's list release challenge.\n\nEach challenge is designed to delay teams in acquiring a paper copy of that year's list of approximately 300 items. Previous examples have included the pages of the list buried under sand at a nearby beach, team captains kidnapped and forced to transcribe items onto their bodies with Sharpies, and copies of the list suspended from a wall six feet high ten feet away from a team representative, because \"the floor is lava.\" Once a team has obtained the list, they travel back to their headquarters (usually a dorm lounge or apartment living room) to begin working on the list of items. Several hours after the release of the list the judges publish it online (usually around 3:00 A.M. CST on the Thursday of the Hunt), thus making it available for teams unable to attend \"List Release.\"\n\nEvery year, teams attempt to complete items from a list of approximately 300. Each item is written, assigned a point value, and put onto the list by a panel of judges known as the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt Organizing Committee. The list has, since 1997, been formatted in LaTeX and released online in PDF and the original LaTeX formats at 3:00 A.M. CST on the Thursday of the Hunt.\n\nSince 2006, the list has begun with a set of official rules, including:\n\nAfter the official rules, a list of qualifying factors for the road trip portion of the scavenger hunt is included. These qualifying factors have been included in the list at the behest of UChicago's Center for Leadership and Involvement (the governing body for registered student organizations) since 2006. The road trip, itself, though, has been a part of the Hunt since 1991.\n\nAfter the road trip qualifications, all \"Scav Olympics\" events are listed. These are original competitions designed annually and held on Eckhart Quad Saturday afternoon of the Hunt. In 2015, for each event, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place were worth 20, 15, and 10 points respectively, while 5 points were awarded to \"(3 < x ≤ ∞)th place.\" After the list of \"Scav Olympics\" events, there are occasionally special lists, such as wedding-associated items in 2015, and \"Scav All-Stars\" items from 2004-2006.\n\nFinally, following the above sections, is the list of all general category items. Item lists are broken up into pages, with one or several judges contributing to the items on each page.\n\nRoad trip, one of the more original elements of the hunt, is constrained by several factors. The furthest destination may be no more than from Chicago and the trip must be completed between 8 a.m. Thursday morning and Saturday night. Additionally, road trip is completed with participants wearing ridiculous costumes. Items for the road trip are scattered throughout the main list.\n\nDrivers on the road trip are held to the following requirements:\n\n\nOn the Friday Night of the Scavenger Hunt, there is usually a large themed event held in one of the gathering spaces on campus. In recent years, this event has been a wedding, a sleepover party with pillow and blanket forts, and a prom dance.\n\nPreviously, this event took the form of a large party held on the main quads attended by scavenger hunt participants and nonparticipants alike. Usually, this party involved a theme. Each team would design their own section of the party with drinks and attire adhering to this theme.\n\nThis long string of parties ended when, in 2006, during a particularly bad storm, the party was moved inside Cobb Hall. The theme that year was \"visions of the future.\" ORCSA, the university administration body responsible for overseeing the Hunt, shut down the party due to intoxicated participants and alleged property damage.\n\nItems on the list include codes and cypher, large scale construction and engineering projects, performances, unusual sports, and difficult to acquire objects. Some items require connections to accomplish such as: get your Scav team a shout out on the news, get a flag on the North Pole, or reach the lowest elevation possible (the winning elevation was reached in a submarine). \n\nEach year there are a handful of particularly large point items. There have typically been three showcase items per list in the recent past. These items are typically over 100 points each, but in the past it was not unusual for an individual item to be 500+ points. These items are judged in competition between the teams and points are awarded according to the ranking. \n\n\nScav Hunt was founded in 1987 by Chris Straus, who organized the list and judged items collected by other residents of Hitchcock house, with Cassie Scharff, Diane Kelly, and Nolan McCarty.\n\nPerhaps the most notable item that has yet been completed was from the 1999 list; a breeder reactor in a shed was successfully built in front of Ida Noyes Hall. The item itself was a joke referring to the \"Radioactive Boy Scout\" David Hahn. The students irradiated thorium with thermal neutrons and observed traces of uranium and plutonium.\n\nIn 2002, Scav Hunt was the subject of a documentary titled \"The Hunt\". The 2007 Scav Hunt was also the subject of a documentary, \"Scavengers\".\n\nThe Scav Hunt formerly held the Guinness World Record for largest scavenger hunt. To obtain the record, the Judges organized a miniature scavenger hunt during the 2011 Hunt. The smaller event was required to meet the Guinness World Record definition of a scavenger hunt. The Scav Hunt has since been officially surpassed for the title of the world's largest scavenger hunt by \"Passport to Provo,\" an event organized by Provo and Google.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Hunt will be held virtually.\n\nThe Scavenger Hunt committee is a registered student organization at the University of Chicago. The committee is made up of judges, those who make the list and determine item completion, and non-judges, who help with other administrative tasks. Judges are known as \"Hot Side Hot\" while non-judge members are known as \"Cold Side Cold\".\n\nThe list is compiled solely by the panel of judges, though the panel also organizes other aspects of the Scav Hunt. Judges begin compiling the list after the end of each Scav Hunt weekend, and continue to add items throughout the year. Members of the panel are sworn to secrecy on the contents of next year's list.\n\nAny University of Chicago student with a GPA above 0.5 may apply to be a judge. Potential judges submit applications consisting of a questionnaire and a sample list of 30 items. Applicants are chosen to interview with the existing judges based on merit. New judges are often previous team captains or perennial participants of the Hunt. Actual methods of judge selection, however, are kept secret. Fragments of the sample lists of the newly chosen judges are often added to next year's list. Applications for new judges open at the beginning of October. New judges are selected by the end of the calendar year. Judges are appointed for life, but are required to maintain eligibility to join a student organization to remain active.\n\nThe head judge, known as the Scavenczar, is appointed at the end of the Scavenger Hunt each year. He or she oversees the planning and execution of the next Scav Hunt, until his or her successor is named.\n\n"}
{"id": "1851142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851142", "title": "KNXV-TV", "text": "KNXV-TV\n\nKNXV-TV, virtual and UHF digital channel 15, is an ABC-affiliated television station licensed to Phoenix, Arizona, United States. The station is owned by the E. W. Scripps Company, as part of a duopoly with CW affiliate KASW (channel 61). KNXV-TV's studios (which also house master control and most internal operations for KASW) are located along North 44th Street on the city's east side (north of Sky Harbor International Airport and next to the Loop 202 and SR 143 interchange), and its transmitter is located atop South Mountain on the city's south side. KASW maintains separate facilities on East Missouri Avenue in Uptown Phoenix. \n\nKNXV-TV's signal is relayed across northern Arizona through a network of 15 low-power translators.\n\nIn February 1975, pioneering UHF broadcaster Edwin Cooperstein announced that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had granted a construction permit to his company, New Television Corp., to build a television station in Phoenix on UHF channel 15. It was expected to begin broadcasting within a year and was intended to place a heavy emphasis on news programming, airing three 90-minute newscasts at different times between 4 p.m. and midnight. The lone legacy of this intended format was the station's callsign, KNXV, standing for \"Newswatch 15\". Plans were soon delayed by the inability to secure financing in a difficult economy, and by the end of 1976, the station still had not been built. Finally on September 9, 1979, more than four-and-a-half years after the construction permit was granted, KNXV-TV signed on the air. Its programming originally consisted of first-run and off-network syndicated shows, and children's programs during the day, with the subscription television service ONTV being broadcast during the nighttime hours. One of the station's most memorable early promotions was the \"Bluebird of Happy News,\" with the voice of Elroy \"Buzz\" Towers (who was voiced by an early station master control/videotape operator) in a helicopter taking jabs at local news on other stations.\n\nIn Phoenix, ONTV held telecast rights at various times to ASU sports, the Phoenix Suns, Phoenix Giants minor league baseball and Los Angeles Kings hockey. By July 1982, it had 39,000 subscribers in Phoenix, but signs of trouble were emerging. In 1981, the Suns signed to telecast games through American Cable (resulting in the launch of the Arizona Sports Programming Network), which sub-licensed games to ONTV in part because they had not wired all of the metropolitan area. Late in 1982, KNXV resisted a request to expand ONTV to start before 7:00 p.m. on weekdays and 5:00 p.m. on weekends, while the station also wanted the subscription service to stop screening adult movies.\n\nPhoenix was one of the first markets to show serious subscriber erosion. By April 1983, its subscriber base had dipped below 25,000, a drop of more than 35 percent. Oak Communications ultimately shuttered ONTV in Phoenix on May 4, 1983, resulting in the loss of 140 jobs. KNXV then became a full-time general entertainment independent station, and ran a number of cartoons, older off-network sitcoms, classic movies and drama series. The station pulled in mediocre ratings and lagged behind longtime independent station KPHO-TV (channel 5). Despite this, Cooperstein was able to sell the station to the E. W. Scripps Company in late 1984, with the sale being finalized in 1985.\n\nUnder Scripps, KNXV began to purchase more recent sitcoms, often outbidding KPHO for strong shows. The station also became the over-the-air broadcaster of the Suns again; it lost the rights to televise the team's games to KUTP (channel 45) in 1988. After KPHO turned down an offer to affiliate with the fledgling Fox network, it approached KNXV. After Scripps promised to launch a news department, KNXV joined Fox at the network's inception on October 6, 1986, with the first Fox program airing on the station being the late night talk show \"The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers\", which was at that time the only program Fox offered, so KNXV still essentially remained independent. KNXV promoted its new affiliation with a campaign centered around the slogan \"Light Up the Night with Late Night Fireworks\". Also in 1986, KNXV began producing \"Friday Night at the Frights\" starring \"Edmus Scarey\" (portrayed by Ed Muscare), a series of decidedly campy B-movie wraparounds. Ed Muscare had previously hosted shows for KNXV sister station KSHB-TV in Kansas City. Stuart Powell, general manager of KNXV in the late 1980s, coaxed Muscare out of retirement.\n\nDuring this period, KNXV made steady ratings gains. By 1990, KNXV nearly tied KPHO in the ratings, even though the station still produced no local newscasts. While KPHO attempted to woo Fox away with its existing news operation, KNXV retained the affiliation, having become by 1992 the second most successful Fox affiliate after KTXL in Sacramento.\n\nOn May 22, 1994, New World Communications signed a long-term groupwide affiliation agreement with Fox that would result in longtime CBS affiliate KSAZ-TV (channel 10, which New World was in the process of acquiring from Citicasters) becoming the Phoenix area's new Fox affiliate. The CBS affiliation, in turn, moved to KPHO, leaving KNXV without an affiliation and the likelihood of reverting into an independent, prompting Scripps to negotiate an affiliation agreement with ABC. CBS heavily wooed longtime ABC affiliates WXYZ-TV and WEWS-TV to switch to that network, which was about to lose its longtime affiliates in Detroit and Cleveland to Fox. In order to allow Scripps to renew its network affiliation agreements with WXYZ-TV and WEWS-TV, ABC agreed to affiliate with KNXV, NBC station WMAR-TV in Baltimore, and Fox affiliate WFTS-TV in Tampa (which was also slated to lose Fox to WTVT). Locally, this resulted in the displacement of ABC from longtime affiliate KTVK (channel 3). As a condition of the deal, KNXV agreed to produce the same amount of local news programming as KTVK had been producing as an ABC affiliate. KNXV also agreed to not preempt any ABC programming, outside of coverage of breaking news events. KTVK later briefly joined the new WB network in 1995, then later that year, became an independent station.\n\nABC's affiliation agreement with KTVK did not expire until December 31, 1994; however, KTVK had already begun to drop ABC shows from its schedule, unhappy about losing its affiliation with the network after 41 years. As a result, ABC's programming migrated to KNXV in stages, and the station carried programming from both ABC and Fox for a while, with ABC as a temporary secondary affiliation. \"Good Morning America\" was the first ABC program to move to KNXV, following the first round of changes at the end of August 1994. KNXV then picked up \"Mike and Maty\", \"World News Now\", \"Nightline\" and ABC's Saturday morning cartoons when the station officially dropped its Fox affiliation on December 15. The rest of ABC's programming moved to KNXV on January 9, 1995. KNXV kept about one-third of its syndicated programming, with the rest moving to other area stations.\n\nKNXV carried the majority of the Arizona Cardinals' NFL games that were not subject to blackouts in the meantime, until those games returned to KSAZ in December 1994. The Cardinals were part of the National Football Conference (NFC), which aired their games on CBS until the end of the 1993 season, before moving the following year to Fox—whose acquisition of the NFC television package from CBS was a major catalyst of Fox's deal with New World. After becoming a full-time ABC affiliate, KNXV was limited to airing the Cardinals' games on \"Monday Night Football\"—the first of which would be in 1995: a Christmas Day contest in Tempe against the eventual Super Bowl champions, the Dallas Cowboys (the Cowboys won 37–13 to clinch home field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs; coincidentally, the Super Bowl was also played in Tempe).\n\nOver the years, KNXV has added more first-run syndicated shows, such as \"Wheel of Fortune\" and \"Jeopardy!\". KNXV has since become the home of preseason games for the Arizona Cardinals. Today, KNXV is a typical ABC affiliate, producing a decent amount of local news programming, and clearing nearly all of the network's programs in their intended time slots. However, KNXV has been one of ABC's weakest affiliates since the 1994 switch. In stark contrast, KTVK dominated the ratings when it was affiliated with ABC.\n\nSince ABC lost NFL rights in 2006, the Cardinals' preseason games have been the only NFL games to be broadcast on KNXV. The Cardinals' regular season games as well as any playoff games that the team appears in are split between KPHO-TV (through CBS), KSAZ-TV (through Fox), KPNX (channel 12, through NBC) and KTVK (through its over-the-air carriage of games televised by NFL Network and ESPN).\n\nDuring the 2007 Little League World Series, KNXV's rights to the Cardinals caused a conflict with ABC's coverage of one of the preliminary-round games. The plan was to move the baseball game to ESPN, thereby interrupting the national feed on Cox Communications and other cable providers in the market. Those getting KNXV by way of satellite would watch the baseball game on an alternate channel. Meanwhile, KNXV would air a preseason game between the Cardinals and the Houston Texans at 1 p.m. that day. KNXV would then rebroadcast the LLWS game on tape delay at about 4:30 p.m. that afternoon.\nOn July 27, 2007, two news helicopters leased to KNXV and KTVK collided while covering a police pursuit in downtown Phoenix. All four people on both helicopters were killed, including KNXV pilot Craig Smith and photographer Rick Krolak.\n\nPrior to the 2009 digital transition that resulted in many stations historically broadcasting on the VHF band moving their channel assignments to UHF, KNXV was ABC's largest affiliate on the UHF band (it remains the largest affiliate to broadcast with a virtual channel number higher than 13.1).\n\nKNXV started a traffic channel on .2 called Go AZ given the area's traffic congestion.\n\nKNXV-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 15, at 12:01 a.m. on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. At 2 a.m. on that date, the station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 56, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era UHF channel 15.\n\nOn April 1, 2015, Scripps acquired Journal Communications, owners of its two nearby ABC affiliates, Las Vegas' ABC affiliate KTNV-TV (channel 13) and Tucson ABC station KGUN-TV (channel 9), becoming sister stations to KNXV. Outside of the small corner of southwest Arizona covered by KECY-DT2 from El Centro, California, this effectively gives E. W. Scripps a monopoly on ABC programming throughout the state of Arizona. (Before KECY-DT2 became an ABC affiliate on January 1, 2007, that area's ABC programming was served by KNXV and eventual Scripps sister station KGTV (channel 10) in San Diego, the former of which had been carried as the default Fox affiliate for the eastern portion of the Yuma market until KECY-TV switched to Fox in late 1994.)\n\nOn March 20, 2019, Scripps announced that it would acquire CW affiliate KASW (channel 61), along with seven other stations, from Nexstar Media Group as part of its proposed acquisition of Tribune Media. This would create a new duopoly between KNXV and KASW, and it would be the third duopoly in the Phoenix market after Fox Television Stations' KSAZ-TV/KUTP and Meredith Corporation's KPHO-TV/KTVK. The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16 and was completed on September 19, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nIn 2011, KNXV digital subchannel 15.2 began carrying the Live Well Network. The station changed the subchannel's affiliation on 15.2 to the classic television network Antenna TV on January 1, 2014.\nSubchannel 15.3 was added with the launch of Laff on April 15, 2015. 15.4 began operation on May 7, 2019, running promos for the relaunched Court TV, which started regular programming the next day.\n\nOutside of the ABC network schedule, syndicated programming featured on KNXV-TV includes \"Wipeout\", \"Right This Minute\", \"Made in Hollywood\" and \"Private Practice\". KNXV was the third station in the Phoenix market to air \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\": the two shows were first seen on KSAZ-TV from 1983/1984 to 1994, then on KTVK from 1994 to 2003. Both shows were dropped by KNXV and other Scripps stations on September 17, 2012 as part of a corporate edict to reduce costs, and were replaced with programs produced by the company, \"Let's Ask America\" and \"The List\", that would initially be syndicated exclusively to the group's stations.\n\n\nSports programming on KNXV is provided through ESPN on ABC and includes any games with the Phoenix Suns, Arizona State Sun Devils football and Arizona Wildcats football selected for the broadcast package.\n\nKNXV-TV presently broadcasts 40½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6½ hours each weekday, five hours on Saturdays and 3½ hours on Sundays). KNXV is one of 10 television stations that airs consumer reports from John Matarese of Scripps sister station WCPO-TV in Cincinnati.\n\nAt the time that KNXV had been named Phoenix's new ABC affiliate in 1994, the station already had been building a news department under General Manager Raymond Hunt. Plans for KNXV's new newscast, originally built to match the Fox feel, included a purple set and special effects. After ABC came to KNXV, the style was toned down, though the set remained. The station's newscasts formally debuted on August 1, 1994, under the \"News 15\" brand name with an 85-person news staff (larger than the 30 that the news department was originally planned to have). By September 1995, KNXV was airing daily newscasts at 6 and 11 a.m. in the morning, and evenings at 5, 6 and 10 p.m. During this time, the news department was being led by Susan Sullivan, who created an environment focused on enterprise and investigative reporting.\n\nIn September 1996, Michael Kronley was installed as station manager from Charlotte ABC affiliate WSOC-TV. The investigative reports were discontinued, replaced by more live shots. The station acquired a helicopter. The next year, KNXV rebranded, with a new slogan, \"We Won't Waste Your Time\". In 2006, KNXV debuted the first 4 p.m. newscast in the Phoenix market, which replaced a rerun of \"Jeopardy!\" in the timeslot.\n\nIn June 2007, KNXV became the third television station in the Phoenix market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. In 2009, KNXV began training its staff of photojournalists and reporters to take on roles as multimedia journalists. Employees in this classification generate story ideas, shoot, edit, write and publish the content.\nOn April 1, 2009, the E. W. Scripps Company and Fox Television Stations announced the formation of the Local News Service model among stations owned by the two station groups in the Phoenix, Detroit and Tampa markets. The service allows the pooling of news-gathering efforts for local news events and each station provides employees to the pool service in exchange for the sharing of video. Meredith Corporation-owned CBS affiliate KPHO-TV eventually joined the Phoenix LNS agreement shortly after the announcement.\n\nOn July 9, 2012, KNXV launched an hour-long midday newscast weekdays at 11 a.m.\nOn January 19, 2013, KNXV debuted weekend morning newscasts, airing from 5 to 7 a.m. with an additional hour running on Saturdays only from 8 to 9 a.m.\n\nOn July 7, 2014, KNXV extended its 6 p.m. newscast from 30 minutes to 60 minutes, making it \"the only hour-long weekday local newscast\" in the Phoenix market. On August 25 of that same year, KNXV reformatted its 4 p.m. newscast into \"The NOW Arizona\" (see above).\n\nIn 2016, KNXV extended its weekend 10 p.m. newscasts to run an hour on both Saturday and Sunday.\n\nOn July 9, 2018, KNXV extended its 4 p.m. newscast to a full hour.\n\n\n"}

Originally covering , the 1962 purchase of land for a garage for the Olympic Hotel expanded the plot to . The Metropolitan Tract is primarily located in a rectangle formed by Seneca St, Third Ave, Union St, and Sixth Ave.\n\nThe tract includes the original site of the University of Washington campus. In 1895 the university moved to its present site. Initially, the University's new law school used one of the old university buildings and the main, original building was leased first to Seattle Public Schools and then to the Seattle Public Library. As construction of commercial buildings began, this original building was moved a few blocks to a site along Fifth Avenue. However, the building fell into increasing disrepair, and an effort led by Edmond Meany to move it to the new campus and rehabilitate it was unsuccessful.\n\nThe state legislature had authorized the university regents to lease or sell the downtown tract. On December 9, 1902, the regents voted to lease rather than sell, although one strip on the northwest corner of the site was sold to the U.S. government for a federal building, on the assumption that this building would increase the value of the rest of the tract.\n\nThe initial 1902 lessee, the University Site Improvement Company, began construction on building for the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\", but the lease was soon forfeited. Next, the land was leased on November 1, 1904 by James A. Moore, who completed the \"P-I\" building and oversaw the continuation of Fourth Avenue through the old campus. In 1907, the same year he opened the Moore Theatre and Hotel, Moore transferred the remaining 47 years of his lease to the Metropolitan Building Company who engaged the New York firm of Howells & Stokes to assemble a master plan for integrated development. Howells & Stokes intended to create a \"city within a city.\" At the time, it was the largest development of a downtown site undertaken in the United States.\n\nHowells & Stokes' design included a department store, offices, a hotel, housing and a small plaza, all to be built in a similar style and scale. All buildings in the tract were to be 11 stories tall, with terracotta ornamentation at the top and street levels and brick in-between. Their decoration would combine elements of the Beaux Arts and commercial (Chicago school) styles, such as symmetry and a clearly marked storefront. Ten structures were proposed; of these, five were actually built.\n\nHowells & Stokes employed Abraham H. Albertson in Seattle to be their local representative and oversee the construction. After the firm closed in 1917, Albertson and other former employees continued the project under the successor firm Howells & Albertson. As of 2007, the Cobb Building is the only one of the original buildings to survive.\n\nCurrently, the Metropolitan Tract contains over of rentable office space, over of rentable commercial space, some 450 hotel rooms and access to over 2,000 parking spaces. The tract is managed and operated through two long-term leases: one with Legacy Hotels for The Fairmont Olympic Hotel and garage, and the other with UNICO Properties, Inc., for all the other buildings in the Tract.\n\nThe following buildings in the Metropolitan Tract are on the National Register of Historic Places\n\nOther buildings of note in the Metropolitan Tract are:\n\nFormer buildings of the Metropolitan Tract include:\n\nThe University of Washington announced plans to redevelop the Rainier Square shopping mall, adjacent to the Rainier Tower, at the expiration of the long-term lease signed with Unico Properties in 2014.

They take about 2 years to orbit Saturn.\n\nThe International Astronomical Union (IAU) uses names taken from Inuit mythology for these moons.\n\nThe group appeared quite homogeneous in early observations, the satellites displaying \"light-red\" colour (colour indices B−V = 0.79 and V−R = 0.51, similar to that of the Gallic group) and similar infrared spectra. Recent observations, however, revealed that Ijiraq is distinctly redder than Paaliaq, Siarnaq and Kiviuq. In addition, unlike the other three, Ijiraq's spectrum does not display weak absorption near 0.7 μm. This feature is attributed to a possible water hydration.\nThe spectral homogeneity (with the exception of Ijiraq) is consistent with a common origin in the break-up of a single object but the dispersion of the orbital parameters requires further explanation. Recently reported secular resonances among the members could provide the explanation of the post-collisional dispersion.\n\nThe discovery of two new moons in this group was announced in October 2019.

Churchill Secondary is one of two International Baccalaureate schools (along with Britannia Secondary School) and one of three French Immersion secondary schools in Vancouver. It is named after the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill. Churchill has the largest student body population in district 39.\n\nChurchill is fed by the surrounding elementary schools in its catchment area. They include Sir Wilfrid Laurier Elementary School, Dr. Annie B. Jamieson Elementary School, Sir William Osler Elementary School, J.W. Sexsmith Elementary School, and David Lloyd George Elementary School. Although not within Churchill's catchment area, L'École Bilingue, Kerrisdale Elementary School, L'École Quilchena and Sir James Douglas Elementary School feed into its French Immersion Program.\n\nChurchill Secondary offers an International Baccalaureate Programme, which attracts many students from the school district to apply. The school also offers the IB Certificate Programme, which allows students in the regular BC provincial curriculum to take part in IB courses. This option is only open when there is a vacancy in that particular class. IB courses include English, French, Japanese, Mandarin, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, History, Art, Psychology, Film Studies, Theatre, Mathematics, and Theory of Knowledge. French Immersion students entering the IB Programme may opt to take a more advanced French course, allowing them to earn a BC French Dogwood Diploma and a bilingual IB diploma simultaneously. \n\nInformation sessions are held each year for entry into the program which requires a written application, previous academic performance record, standardized testing (PSAT), and an interview. \n\nAs part of Global Families, a project where IB students choose a developing country to educate others on, students host World Awareness Day in which they set up displays in downtown Vancouver to teach the public about their country of choice. Students can also get involved as a member of IB Council or as an IB Director.\n\nThe program prepares students for post-secondary studies, with the possibility of receiving post-secondary credit for transferable courses, and many of Churchill's IB graduates go on to study at the University of British Columbia. \n\nThere is also a Pre-IB programme in grade 10 which is called Prelude from 2016. Prelude is available for both French Immersion and English students. There is one class of French Immersion Prelude students and two classes of English Prelude Students.\n\nIdeal Mini School is a grade 8–12 mini school program.\n\nThe Synergy programme is for students in grades 8 and 9 who have demonstrated excellence and wish to augment their learning through an enhanced curriculum. A portfolio and an entrance test are required for admission.\n\nSecondary French immersion is for students continuing on from elementary French immersion. There are two types of French immersion programs in elementary school: regular \"French immersion\" and \"late-immersion\". \"French immersion\" refers to French immersion programs that begin at the kindergarten level, while \"late-immersion\" refers to French immersion programs that begin in the 4th grade. Students can receive a Bilingual Graduation Certificate. Students in French immersion can also participate in the IB program and receive a bilingual IB diploma. Students participate yearly in a French speech arts competition and are categorized between anglophone and francophone.\n\nSir Winston Churchill has over 100 different clubs to join with something for everyone. You can find many different groups such as Dissection club, service club, debate club, yoga club and many others for you to discover and enjoy.\n\nAn annual school science fair is held at Churchill Secondary, and twenty projects are chosen to represent the school at the Vancouver District Science Fair. Winners there move onto the Greater Vancouver Regional Science Fair, and then onto the Canada-Wide Science Fair.\n\nThe school's mascot is a bulldog, since Sir Winston Churchill, whom the school is named after, looked like a bulldog. It offers volleyball, boys soccer, field hockey, swimming, curling, and cross country teams in the fall; basketball, girls ice hockey, and table tennis teams in the winter; and girls soccer, rugby, track & field, badminton, tennis, golf, girls softball, and ultimate teams in the springtime. Teams are divided by age group: Bantam (Grade 8), Juvenile (Grade 9), Junior (Grade 10), and Senior (Grades 11 & 12). \n\nThe school has 8 competitive teams for boys and girls and offers a basketball course to further student's skills. Every year the school hosts the Bulldog Classic, a basketball tournament with schools participating from around the Greater Vancouver region. On March 16, 2014, the Senior Boys Basketball Team won the AAAA B.C. High School Boys Championship against Surrey's Holy Cross.\n\nChurchill has a Senior A field hockey team, which practices on the school campus's upper field. In 2012, Churchill Senior A was almost undefeated in the regular season except for a 1-0 loss against Richmond's McMath. They also won the Vancouver city championship that year. along with the championships from 2015-2018. Churchill Senior A had consistently won a seed in the BC AAA Girls Field Hockey Provincials, however, in the 2013 season lost the seat to rivals Eric Hamber Griffins.. In the recent years, Churchill has done well in provincials and placed 8th in 2018 then however slipping down to 13th place in 2019.\n\nSince 2015 the school has a swimming team, that competes on a city level and takes part in the British Columbia provincial championship.\n\nSir Winston Churchill is a competitor in Reach for the Top, and has won the provincial championship in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Churchill students have participated in local science fairs. Clubs at the school include supporting various advocacy groups and interests, including a debate team, such as the Free the Children, World Vision, UNICEF and Amnesty International clubs. The school also hosts several student-run publications including the \"Big Bang Science Journal,\" \"Newsfeed\" \"and Extended Essay\". In 2010, Churchill had the most runners as a school in the Vancouver Sun Run with 721 participants. Churchill's student-run website SWCsocial hosts the Churchill's Got Talent music competition powered by online voting and filmed the school's lip dub video.\n\nChurchill has several sustainability student groups, with Environmental Club and the Youth 4 Tap Club being the most notable.

The program involved the development of three principal capabilities. The first was to design, build and launch satellites to a sun synchronous orbit. The second was to establish and operate ground stations for spacecraft control, data transfer along with data processing and archival. The third was to use the data obtained for various applications on the ground. \n\nIndia demonstrated the ability of remote sensing for societal application by detecting coconut root-wilt disease from a helicopter mounted multispectral camera in 1970. This was followed by flying two experimental satellites, Bhaskara-1 in 1979 and Bhaskara-2 in 1981. These satellites carried optical and microwave payloads.\n\nIndia's remote sensing programme under the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) started off in 1988 with the IRS-1A, the first of the series of indigenous state-of-art operating remote sensing satellites, which was successfully launched into a polar sun-synchronous orbit on March 17, 1988 from the Soviet Cosmodrome at Baikonur. \n\nIt has sensors like LISS-I which had a spatial resolution of 72.5 meters with a swath of 148 km on ground. LISS-II had two separate imaging sensors, LISS-II A and LISS-II B, with spatial resolution of 36.25 meters each and mounted on the spacecraft in such a way to provide a composite swath of 146.98 km on ground. These tools quickly enabled India to map, monitor and manage its natural resources at various spatial resolutions. The operational availability of data products to the user organisations further strengthened the relevance of remote sensing applications and management in the country.\n\nFollowing the successful demonstration flights of Bhaskara-1 and Bhaskara-2 satellites launched in 1979 and 1981, respectively, India began to develop the indigenous Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite program to support the national economy in the areas of agriculture, water resources, forestry and ecology, geology, water sheds, marine fisheries and coastal management.\n\nTowards this end, India had established the National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS) for which the Department of Space (DOS) is the nodal agency, providing operational remote sensing data services. Data from the IRS satellites is received and disseminated by several countries all over the world. With the advent of high-resolution satellites new applications in the areas of urban sprawl, infrastructure planning and other large scale applications for mapping have been initiated.\n\nThe IRS system is the largest constellation of remote sensing satellites for civilian use in operation today in the world, with 11 operational satellites. All these are placed in polar Sun-synchronous orbit and provide data in a variety of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. Indian Remote Sensing Programme completed its 25 years of successful operations on March 17, 2013.\n\nData from Indian Remote Sensing satellites are used for various applications of resources survey and management under the National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS). Following is the list of those applications:\n\n\nThe initial versions are composed of the 1 (A,B,C,D). The later versions are named based on their area of application including OceanSat, CartoSat, ResourceSat. Some of the satellites have alternate designations based on the launch number and vehicle (P series for PSLV).\n\nData from IRS is available to its users through NRSC Data Centre and also through Bhuvan Geoportal of ISRO. NRSC data center provides data through its purchase process while Bhuvan Geoportal provides data in free and open domain.\n\nThe capacity building programme of ISRO for IRS and other remote sensing applications is through Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS) Dehradun and UN affiliated Center of Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific (CSSTEAP) Center located at Dehradun of Uttrakhand State in India.\n\nFollowing are the remote sensing satellites planned by ISRO to be launched next strengthening the fleet of IRS satellites and widening their applications:\n\n\n\n"}

Their semi-major axes range between 16 and 19 Gm, their inclinations between 35° and 40°, and their eccentricities around 0.53.\n\nThe International Astronomical Union (IAU) reserves names taken from Gallic mythology for these moons.\n\nSimilar mean orbital elements led the discoverers to postulate a common origin for the group in a breakup of a larger body. The group was later found to be physically homogeneous, all satellites displaying \"light-red\" colour (colour indices B − V = 0.91 and V − R = 0.48) and similar infrared indices \n\nRemarkably, recent observations revealed that the largest member of the group, Albiorix, displays actually two different colours: one compatible with Erriapus and Tarvos, and another less red. Instead of the common progenitor, it was postulated that Tarvos and Erriapus could be fragments of Albiorix, leaving a large, less red crater. Such an impact would require a body with the diameter in excess of 1 km and relative velocity close to 5 km/s, resulting in a large crater with the radius of 12 km. Numerous, very large craters observed on Phoebe, prove the existence of such collisions in the Saturnian system's past.\n\nThe discovery of 20 new moons of Saturn was announced in October 2019 by a team led by Scott S. Sheppard using the Subaru Telescope at Mauna Kea. One of them, S/2004 S 24, is also prograde, but it orbits much further away from Saturn than the four known Gallic moons. This moon will nevertheless also receive a name from Gallic mythology.\n\nThe four members of the group discovered before 2019 are (in order of increasing distance from Saturn):\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1851173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851173", "title": "Hercules beetle", "text": "Hercules beetle\n\nThe Hercules beetle (\"Dynastes hercules\") is a species of rhinoceros beetle native to the rainforests of Central America, South America, and the Lesser Antilles. It is the longest extant species of beetle in the world, and is also one of the largest flying insects in the world.\n\n\"Dynastes hercules\" is known for its tremendous strength and is named after Hercules, a hero of classical mythology who is famed for his great strength.\n\n\"D. hercules\" has a complex taxonomic history and has been known by several synonyms. It is in the subfamily Dynastinae (rhinoceros beetles) in the larger family Scarabaeidae (commonly known as scarab beetles). Not counting subspecies of \"D. hercules\", seven other species are recognized in the genus \"Dynastes\".\n\nSeveral subspecies of \"D. hercules\" have been named, though still some uncertainty exists as to the validity of the named taxa.\n\n\nAdult body sizes (not including the thoracic horn) vary between in length and in width. Male Hercules beetles may reach up to in length (including the horn), making them the longest species of beetle in the world, if jaws and/or horns are included in the measurement. The size of the horn is naturally variable, more so than any variation of the size of legs, wings, or overall body size in the species. This variability results from developmental mechanisms that coincide with genetic predisposition in relation to nutrition, stress, exposure to parasites, and/or physiological conditions.\n\n\"D. hercules\" is highly sexually dimorphic, with only males exhibiting the characteristic horns (one on the head, and a much larger one on the prothorax). The body of males is black with the exception of the elytra, which can have shades of olive-green. They have a black suture with sparsely distributed black spots elsewhere on the elytra. They have a slightly iridescent coloration to their elytra, which varies in color between specimens and may be affected by the humidity of the local environment in which they develop. At low humidity the elytra are olive-green or yellow in color, but darken to black at higher humidity due to changes in light refraction.\n\nFemales of \"D. hercules\" have punctured elytra which are usually entirely black, but sometimes have the last quarter of the elytra colored in the same way as the males.\n\nPopulations of \"D. hercules\" may be found from southern Mexico to Bolivia in mountainous and lowland rain forests. Known populations include the Lesser Antilles, Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. Chromosomal analysis has shown that the genus \"Dynastes\" in fact originated from South America.\n\nNot much is known about the life cycle in the wild, but much evidence has been gained through observations of captive-bred populations. The mating season for adults typically occurs during the rainy season (July to December). Females have an average gestation period of 30 days from copulation to egg-laying, and may lay up to 100 eggs on the ground or on dead wood. The eggs have an incubation period of approximately 27.7 days before they hatch. Once hatched, the larval stage of the Hercules beetle may last up to two years in duration, where it will go through 3 metamorphosis stages, also known as instars. The larvae have a yellow body with a black head. The larvae can grow up to in length and weigh more than 100 grams. In laboratory conditions at 25 ± 1°C, the first instar stage lasts an average of 50 days, the second stage an average of 56 days, and the third an average of 450 days. After the third instar stage, the pupal stage lasts about 32 days, where it will transition into an adult . Adult beetles can live for three to six months in captivity.\n\nThe larvae of the Hercules beetle are saproxylophagous, this means that they feed on rotting wood, in which they also reside during the two-year developmental stage. The adult Hercules beetle feeds on fresh and rotting fruit. They have been observed feeding on peaches, pears, apples, and grapes in captivity.\n\nWithin their native rain forest habitats, the adult beetles, which are nocturnal, forage for fruit at night and hide or burrow within the leaf litter during the day. The adult \"D. hercules\" beetles are capable of creating a 'huffing' sound, generated by stridulating their abdomen against their elytra to serve as a warning to predators. Like most insects, communication within the species is a mix of chemoreception, sight, and mechanical perception. Experiments on \"D. hercules\" have shown that a male placed in the vicinity of a female will immediately orient towards her and seek her out, suggesting chemical communication through strong sexual pheromones.\n\nIt has been observed in wild habitat and in captivity that male \"D. hercules\" will engage in combat to win possession and mating rights to a female. Male Hercules beetles typically use their large horns to settle mating disputes; these fights can cause significant physical damage to the combatants but may also include possible damage to the female in the process. During fights, the males attempt to grab and pin their rival between the cephalic and thoracic horns to lift and throw them. The successful male wins mating rights with the female, though the beetles remain polygynandrous.\n\nReports suggest the Hercules beetle is able to carry up to 850 times its body mass. Actual measurements on a much smaller (and relatively stronger: see square-cube law) species of rhinoceros beetle shows a carrying capacity only up to 100 times their body mass, at which point they can barely move.\n\n\"D. hercules\" does not negatively affect human activities, either as an agricultural pest or disease vector. The beetles can be kept as pets.\n\n\"D. hercules\" is a beneficial contributor to the rain forest ecosystem, primarily during their larval stage where they are saproxylophagous. Feeding on rotting wood assists with biodegradation and cycling nutrients in the environment.\n\n"}

He has been the host of The Morning Rush with Bill Carroll on CFRA in Ottawa since March 7, 2016.\n\nIn June 2015, Carroll was named #5 on Newsmax's 50 most influential local talk radio hosts.\n\nCarroll was born in Scotland on July 29, 1959 and grew up in Coatbridge near Glasgow. He came with his family to Toronto, Ontario, Canada in the late 1960s. The family first lived in Don Mills in an apartment (later in a townhouse in Scarborough), where he attended Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute, a few years before Mike Myers.\n\nBill married Sylvie LaPointe in July 2003. They have two children, Killian and Magalie. Like Bill's father, Magalie was born with spina bifida. Bill has cited as one of the reasons for his relocation to California was to be closer to Ramon Cuevas, a physical therapist who had worked with Magalie.\n\nOut of high school in 1980, Carroll moved to New Liskeard, Ontario. \"My first job was as \"news director\" for the station CJTT. This meant I was also the morning news anchor and the news reporter — I was a one-man department. But it was a great place to learn about broadcast journalism. \"I hadn't formally studied journalism, so once I got the job I bought every book on broadcast journalism I could find. At night I would study to be a broadcast journalist, and practice during the day.\" Bill was the co-host of MuchMusic's game show spoof \"Test Pattern\", along with Dan Gallagher. After a stint in Peterborough, Ontario, he joined Q107 in Toronto, on a news program named \"Barometer\". He subsequently worked at its sister station TALK 640 as morning host, before joining CFRB in 1998; first as a weekend newscaster and entertainment reporter, then as news director, before assuming his talk show.\n\nIn October 2004, Carroll was named to host Global Television's \"Focus Ontario\", a weekly public affairs show. His tenure there lasted until fall 2005, when he was replaced by Sean Mallen.\n\nOn December 21, 2012, Carroll made an announcement on his Facebook page. \"Today I have in my hand a new long term agreement to remain at KFI. Awesome! But that's not all. Starting January 7th next year, my Toronto fans can hear me each weekday on Talk Radio AM640 as they drive home from 4 to 7 PM. A completely different show for Toronto listeners on issues they care about. 640 in L.A. and 640 in T.O. It's almost poetic. To my Toronto fans, thanks so for missing me.\" He was joined on AM640 Toronto by Sandy Salerno and Chris Chreston.\n\nOn January 7, 2016, at the end of the final hour of his daily broadcast, Carroll announced that this would be his last show on KFI, and that he was leaving, effective immediately, and moving back to Canada to be closer to family.\n\nOn February 5, 2016, at the end of his show, Carroll announced that he had decided not to stay on CFMJ- AM640 as he was not able to secure a long term contract renewal and wanted certainty for his family. The February 5th show was his last show for CFMJ.\n\nOn February 18, 2016, Carroll was announced as the new morning host on AM 580 CFRA in Ottawa to premiere on March 7. The new program is to be called \"The Morning Rush with Bill Carroll\".\n\nOn April 26, 2007 the Ontario Provincial government launched a new environment campaign with a slogan \"FLICK-OFF\". The phrase resembled the derogatory phrase \"fuck off\" (because the 'L' and the 'I' together could be perceived as a 'U'). Carroll claimed children will see the derogatory word, sending the wrong message. He sarcastically told the government and some callers to Flick-off on live radio.\n\nOn December 15, 2006, it was announced on \"The Six O'clock News Hour\" that Bill Carroll would be replacing Ted Woloshyn as host of \"The Morning Show\" starting January 2007. Woloshyn had announced that very morning that he was resigning, after celebrating his tenth anniversary as CFRB Morning host (following Wally Crouter's 50-year tenure).\n\nHowever, Carroll unlike Woloshyn, started his show at 6:00 am instead of 5:30 am. His show ends at 10:00 am instead of 8:30 am. In 2009, he was moved to the 9 am to 1 pm slot as host of an eponymous program which ran until his move to Los Angeles the next year.\n\nIn March 2007, Tim Hortons filed a defamation lawsuit against Carroll, Standard Radio, which owned CFRB, and CanWest for his allegations on CFRB and Global TV that the Canadian taxpayers were footing the bill for its well-publicised franchise in Afghanistan.\n\nCarroll said on his Global TV commentary: \"Tim Hortons has been sliding by on the great publicity about the Kandahar franchise all these months and then Global uncovers the dirty little secret. You and I, the taxpayers, are picking up $4 or 5 million dollars a year so that they can look good to the public ... Shame on Tim Hortons.\"\n\nTim Hortons Inc. is seeking $35 million from all three for the false statement.\n\nCarroll sits as a member of the Board of Governors for the Canadian student newspaper, The Prince Arthur Herald.\n\n"}

It is the second fastest rising river in Scotland, and it runs through the village of Ettrickbridge some dozen miles downstream, and the old town of Selkirk.\n\nEttrick Forest was a large Royal forest that is much depleted due to sheep farming and industrial forestry, though at some places by the banks of the Water, and in the ravines of its tributaries, places difficult for sheep and of small interest to loggers, the remnants of the fauna which composed the ancient forest can still be seen and enjoyed.\n\nTraditionally, hill farming of sheep and cattle farming have been important. In recent years, tourism has become increasingly important.\n\nThe area around Ettrick has several literary connections. The poet James Hogg (1770–1835), known as the \"Ettrick Shepherd\", was born at a farm within Ettrick parish, near Ettrick Hall, and is buried in Ettrick Kirkyard. \"Laverlaw\", the fictional estate of Sandy Arbuthnot, Lord Clanroyden, in the works of John Buchan, is set near Ettrick.

Unlike for the Inuit and Gallic groups, the orbital parameters are widely dispersed and group is likely to be composed from a number of subgroups with more homogenous orbital and physical parameters.

{"id": "1851210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851210", "title": "Good Witch of the North", "text": "Good Witch of the North\n\nThe Good Witch of the North, sometimes named Locasta or Tattypoo, is a fictional character in the Land of Oz, created by American author L. Frank Baum. She is the elderly and mild-mannered Ruler of the Gillikin Country. Her only significant appearance in Baum's work is in Chapter 2 of \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" (1900), in which she introduces Dorothy to Oz and sends her to meet the Wizard, after placing a protective kiss on her forehead. She makes a brief cameo appearance at Princess Ozma's birthday party in \"The Road to Oz\" (1909), but is otherwise only mentioned elsewhere in the series.\n\nL. Frank Baum presented her as an extremely kind and gentle character who stood against the oppression and subjugation of people. She became the Ruler of the Gillikin Country in the North after freeing the Gillikins from the clutches of Mombi, the erstwhile Wicked Witch of the North. However, the character's kindness and magnanimity of spirit was not confined to her own domain, and she was loved not only by her own subjects but also by other people in Oz, such as the Munchkins. Although she wasn't as powerful as the Wicked Witch of the East and was hence unable to depose her the way she deposed Mombi, the Good Witch of the North was nonetheless exceedingly sensitive to the plight of the enslaved Munchkins, who regarded her as their friend. She also appears as a highly altered player in Ruth Plumly Thompson's \"The Giant Horse of Oz\" (1928), in which she is called Tattypoo.\n\nHer role was significantly expanded in the 1902 musical extravaganza, in which L. Frank Baum named her Locasta. The character was more famously conflated with that of Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, for the 1939 film version.\n\nIn the original novel \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", the Good Witch of the North is summoned to the Munchkin Country when Dorothy Gale's falling house kills the Wicked Witch of the East. She arrives at the site of the Wicked Witch's death with three Munchkins and is the only one brave enough to speak to Dorothy, who, having killed the Witch of the East, is believed to be a powerful sorceress. She welcomes Dorothy to the Land of the Munchkins, points out the body of the dead witch and then introduces herself as the Witch of the North. Having been told that all witches are evil, Dorothy is initially frightened of her, but she assures Dorothy that she is a good witch who is much loved by her people. She also mentions that she is not as powerful as the Witch of the East had been, or she would have liberated the Munchkins from slavery herself. Using a magic slate formed from her hat, she advises Dorothy to travel to the Emerald City to seek the aid of the powerful Wizard of Oz in returning to Kansas. She kisses Dorothy on the forehead, a magical act that serves to protect Dorothy on the journey, because \"no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North\". This statement is proven to be correct later in the book, when the sight of the shining mark left by the kiss prevents Dorothy from being harmed by the Winged monkeys or the Wicked Witch of the West. The sight of this mark is also one of the factors which convinces the Wizard to admit Dorothy to his presence.\n\nAt the beginning of \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\", it is revealed that the Good Witch of the North had banned the practice of magic by any other witch in Gillikin Country (thereby minimizing potential future threats). The Gillikin Country had once been under the power of Mombi, but she was overpowered and routed by the Good Witch of the North, as revealed in \"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\". Thus, the Wicked Witch of the North was forced to be no more than a lowly wizardess, under the Good Witch of the North's rule.\n\nIn Baum's fifth Oz book, \"The Road to Oz\", the Witch of the North is one of the many guests who attend Ozma's birthday party. She amuses the attendees by transforming ten stones into ten birds, the ten birds into ten lambs, and the ten lambs into ten little girls, who gave a pretty dance and were then transformed back into ten stones once again.\n\nThe name of the Good Witch of the North in Baum's own stage version of \"The Wizard of Oz\" is Locasta.\n\nIn the classic 1939 MGM movie \"The Wizard of Oz\", the Good Witch of the North is called Glinda, which is the name of the Good Witch of the South in the Oz novels. In the movie, Glinda the Good Witch of the North, portrayed by Billie Burke, is only slightly matronly and quite beautiful, and in addition to meeting Dorothy on her arrival in Oz, she also supervises her progress on her journey to the Wizard and helps her find her way back to Kansas at the end of the story. She wears a coral pink ball gown with a matching crown and carries a long magic wand with a glittering star on the tip. Although the existence of a \"Good Witch of the South\" is implied by the cardinal point names of Glinda and the other two witches, the film makes no direct reference to such a character.\n\nIn \"The Giant Horse of Oz\", Ruth Plumly Thompson names the Good Witch of the North \"Tattypoo\"; as the story unfolds, Tattypoo turns out to be the bewitched form of a beautiful Munchkin queen named Orin. Orin had originally been kidnapped by the former Wicked Witch of the North, Mombi, who was in love with her husband, King Cheeriobed of the Ozure Isles. In order to remove her rival, Mombi kidnapped Orin soon after the birth of her son, Prince Philador. She then transformed Orin into an old witch who had no recollection of her former life as Queen of the Ozure Isles. Eventually, as Tattypoo, Orin was able to displace Mombi as the ruler of the Gillikins. After being restored to her real self, twenty five years later, Orin loses the magical powers she acquired as the Good Witch of the North. She returns to her husband and son and resumes her life as Queen of the Ozure Isles, no longer wishing to rule the Gillikin Country. At the end of the book, Princess Ozma proclaims Jo King and Queen Hyacinth from a Gillikin province named Up Town as the new rulers of the Gillikins.\n\nIn 2000, Dave Hardenbrook published \"The Unknown Witches of Oz\", with Locasta, the Good Witch of the North, as the main protagonist. Dave Hardenbrook wished to reconcile L. Frank Baum's original version of the character with Ruth Plumly Thompson's version. In Hardenbrook's novel, Locasta and Queen Orin were \"switched\" by Mombi, the same way Mombi \"switched\" herself with the maid Jellia Jamb in L. Frank Baum's novel, \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\". Locasta, the true Good Witch of the North, was lost in the Great Outside World, while the enchanted Queen Orin took her title under the name of Tattypoo. Hardenbrook's novel outlines Locasta's return to the Land of Oz.\n\nIn Alexander Melentyevich Volkov's Magic Land series, the Witch's name is Villina. When the Wicked Witch of the East tried (in that continuity) to exterminate the humanity by means of a magical hurricane, Villina changed the spell so that it only affected one house (which, as her magical book said, was always empty during storms), and dropped it upon the Wicked Witch. Her magical slate is changed into a tiny book which transforms into a giant tome when blown upon, and, in addition to the divination qualities, also functions as an encyclopedia. She appears in two books after the first one (although in one of them she appears off stage, and it is narrated to the main characters).\n\nBoth Gregory Maguire's 1995 revisionist novel \"\" and the musical \"Wicked\" (based on the book), follow the model of the 1939 movie in giving the name \"Glinda\" to the character who grows up to become The Good Witch of the North. See the article on Glinda the Good Witch for more information on this character.\n\nIn William F. Brown and Charlie Smalls's Broadway hit, \"The Wiz\", the Good Witch of the North is named \"Addaperle\". She is portrayed by Amber Riley in the 2015 television special. In the 1978 film version, her name is \"Miss One\" (played by Thelma Carpenter). Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, is a separate character in both stage and film versions.\n\nIn the 1982 anime film, The Good Witch of the North is again the grandmotherly figure of the novel. In the American version, she is voiced by an unbilled Elizabeth Hanna, who also played the Wicked Witch of the West. While appearing very young, Glinda (Wendy Thatcher) refers to the Good Witch of the North as her sister.\n\nGlinda, along with her other good witch counterpart, appear in a little-known 1995 version of \"The Wizard of Oz\" made for British television. After the defeat of the Wicked Witch of the West, she reveals to Dorothy (Denise Van Outen) that the Ruby Slippers ended up in the possession of the Wicked Witch of the East after falling off the feet of a previous visitor from over the rainbow (Zöe Salmon, in a cameo appearance) after she wished to go back to where she came from. She refuses to take possession of them, as she's afraid of being tempted by their power, so she summons the other good witch, who takes them after Dorothy wishes herself home.\n\nIn \"The Muppets' Wizard of Oz\", Glinda and the Good Witch of the North are again separate characters (and the Good Witch of the North has the name Tattypoo), although they are both played by Miss Piggy (as are the two Wicked Witches). Miss Piggy's other role was herself. Prior to Dorothy's return, she appears with Kermit and tries to get rid of Dorothy. After Dorothy's return, she returns for the Muppets' show.\n\nThe \"VeggieTales\" episode \"The Wonderful Wizard of Ha's\" from \"Big Idea Productions\" contains Madame Blueberry as \"Splenda the Sweet But Non-Fattening Fairy\" (brand name for a sugar substitute) replacing both of the two Good Witches.\n\nShe makes no appearance in the Disney film \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" because this film has Glinda as the Good Witch of the South.\n\nThe \"Witch of the North\", played by Karen Holness, makes an appearance in the third season of \"Once Upon a Time\". She is initially a good witch, helping out Glinda as part of the Sisterhood of Witches. Later, after the Wicked Witch of the West takes over Emerald City, She is relocated back to the North, where she becomes the cruel \"Wicked Witch of the North\" and is responsible for turning Stanum into the Tin Man.\n\nIn the 2014 novel \"Dorothy Must Die\", by Danielle Paige, former Good Witch of the North Gert is a member of the Order of the Wicked.\n"}

The school is a function of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tulsa and operates in the Lasallian tradition of the Brothers of the Christian Schools (Christian Brothers or the French Christian Brothers).\n\nBishop Kelley is a comprehensive secondary school with a college-preparatory style curriculum consisting of tracks designed to fit a variety of learning abilities and interests. Bishop Kelley students come from 53 different zip codes, with incoming freshmen and transfer students matriculating from more than 30 middle schools across Northeast Oklahoma. Students come from a variety of faith and educational backgrounds. They are traditionally welcomed with extensive freshman orientation activities.\n\nThough Bishop Kelley is the flagship diocesan Catholic high school for the Diocese of Tulsa, it serves both Catholic and non-Catholic students. The school consistently ranks as one of the best private high schools in Oklahoma. \n\nBishop Kelley was established in 1960 to serve as Tulsa's citywide Catholic high school. At the time of its founding, its forerunners, Holy Family High School (founded 1899) and Marquette High School (founded in 1926), closed and consolidated their student bodies into the newly formed Bishop Kelley High School. While the initial plans for the school were developed under Bishop Eugene J. McGuinness' leadership, it was the pioneering Bishop Victor Joseph Reed who oversaw its founding. Bishop Reed was a famous Catholic reformer who attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council, where he was associated with the more progressive bishops, lending his support to the use of vernacular in the Mass and to an emphasis of pastoral over administrative skills in bishops. Bishop Reed is in part responsible for the high school's legacy of lay leadership. In 1960, the year Bishop Kelley High School was founded, Bishop Reed established the first mixed (clerical and lay) diocesan board of education in the United States.\n\nThe school was named for Bishop Francis Kelley, the second bishop of Oklahoma. The founder of the Catholic Church Extension Society, Bishop Kelley was an accomplished author and diplomat, whom H.L. Mencken described as \"a charming Irishman\" who \"has had a brilliant career in the Church.\" He famously partnered with California oilman Edward L. Doheny to support Catholic philanthropy.\n\nAt its founding, male students were taught by the LaSallian (French) Christian Brothers, who still teach at the school, while the Sisters of Divine Providence from San Antonio, Texas taught the female students. By 1965, the school had become entirely coeducational. By 1982, the Sisters of Divine Providence had been reassigned to other ministries.\n\nThe original school building was designed by architect Robert Lawton Jones, a Tulsa Catholic who had been a protege of Mies Van der Rohe.\n\nCo-curricular opportunities include Academic Bowl, Christian Service, Class Board, Comet Ambassadors, Competitive One-Act, Drama, Drumline, Environmental Club, FCA, Foreign Language Clubs,3 on 3, Jazz Choir, Kairos, Kelley Krazies (a spirit organization), Link Crew (dedicated to mentoring freshmen), Lasallian Youth, Mission Trips, National Forensic League, Performing Arts, Play Production/Theater Tech, Photography Club, ProLife Club, Retreats, Robotics, and Student Council. The school is a frequent winner of state championships in speech and debate, academic bowl, and robotics competitions.\n\nBishop Kelley has won more state championships than any other school of its size in Oklahoma, including state championships in baseball, football, soccer, softball, volleyball, basketball, tennis, golf and cross country. Its women's volleyball and women's soccer teams have been nationally ranked. Bishop Kelley was the first Tulsa high school to support a lacrosse team.\n\nNCAA head coach Barry Hinson (currently coaching at Southern Illinois University) coached the men's basketball team at Bishop Kelley.\nBishop Kelley is also the site for Russell Westbrook's \"Why Not\" Basketball camp.\n\nIn football, Bishop Kelley shares a tradition with cross-state rival Bishop McGuinness Catholic High School. The winner of the contest obtains possession of the \"Shillelagh Trophy\" for the upcoming year. The schools also compete annually in boys and girls basketball.\n\nAcademic Bowl - 1993, 1995, 1998, 2004, 2005*, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018\n\nBaseball - 1976, 1978, 2004, 2006, 2011, 2018\n\nBoys Basketball - 1995\n\nBoys Cross Country - 1967, 1968, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 2005, 2008\n\nGirls Cross Country - 1985, 1986, 2018\n\nFast Pitch Softball - 1977, 1991, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2001\n\nFootball - 1981\n\nBoys Golf - 1986, 1988, 1993, 2002, 2012, 2013\n\nGirls Golf - 1996, 2000, 2001, 2006\n\nBoys Soccer - 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2017, 2018\n\nGirls Soccer - 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2017\n\nSpeech and Debate - 1993, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2011, 2012, 2013\n\nBoys Tennis - 1995, 1999, 2001, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010\n\nGirls Tennis - 1985, 1987, 1995, 1997, 2006, 2007, 2008\n\nVolleyball - 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2018\n\nWrestling - 1974, 1975, 1984, 1985\n\nSpirit Squad - 2016, 2017, 2018\n\nTotal : 105\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1851219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851219", "title": "Radiosomaggismo", "text": "Radiosomaggismo\n\nRadiosomaggismo (Italian for the \"Radiant days of May\") describes a brief period of popular demonstrations in a number of Italian cities in May 1915, demanding the country’s entry into the First World War.\n\nAlthough in 1915 Italy was a member of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, the Italian government of Antonio Salandra had entered into clandestine discussions to join the Triple Entente. This led to the signing of the secret Treaty of London on 26 April by which Italy agreed to enter the war within one month. On 4 May Italy renounced the Triple Alliance, but did not yet enter the war in the side of the Entente as a majority in parliament continued to favour neutrality. The former Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti was warned that Salandra intended to take the country to war, and on 9 May he returned to Rome to try to prevent this. On 10 May he tried to persuade King Victor Emmanuel that a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies would show that parliament did not support entry into the war. Realising that he could not secure a majority, on 13 May, Salandra resigned.\n\nThe return of Giolitti to Rome made nationalists and pro-war advocates fear that he would once again become Prime Minister and keep Italy out of the war. This led to the publication of many hostile stories in the press, asserting that Italian pride and honour demanded war. In a speech on 12 May, Gabriele D’Annunzio incited violence, saying that those who refused to take up arms were traitors, and urging the Romans to throw all the filth into the sewers. The following day, the neutralist deputy and former minister Pietro Bertolini was assaulted by an angry mob in the Piazza Colonna while riding on a tram. Other deputies, Luigi Facta, Antonio Graziadei, and were also threatened and jeered at. In a number of cities there were violent demonstrations and a number of newspaper offices were sacked. In Bologna, the socialist deputy was chased and beaten.\n\nOn 14 May, when news of Salandra’s resignation became public, a crowd of young people besieged the Palazzo Montecitorio where the Italian Chamber of Deputies was sitting, and attempted to set fire to its doors. They were disgusted with representative democracy and in favour of an irridentist war to secure Trieste and Trentino. They articulated a belief that unless it declared war, Italy would become an “effeminate” country. Protests spread into government departments on 15 May, when senior officials led their demonstrations of support for Salandra, who seems to have at least tacitly welcomed this unusual breach of civil service norms.\n\nGiolitti declined the king’s offer to form a government, and on 16th May Salandra was invited to return as Prime Minister. Strongly influenced by these demonstrations of public ardour, on 20 May parliament voted to declare war on the Central Powers and on 22 May it granted full power to the government to censor the press and to pass public order laws for the duration of the war. On 23 May Italy entered the war. \n\n“Radiosomaggismo” has been discussed as an early indicator of the rise of fascism in Italy, as it involved a popular movement with violently reactionary views. Both its takeover of the streets and the disillusionment of sections of the middle class with the traditional liberalism of Giolitti that it represented were characteristics of the fascist movement when it emerged.\n"}

{"id": "1851223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851223", "title": "HITS algorithm", "text": "HITS algorithm\n\nHyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS; also known as hubs and authorities) is a link analysis algorithm that rates Web pages, developed by Jon Kleinberg. The idea behind Hubs and Authorities stemmed from a particular insight into the creation of web pages when the Internet was originally forming; that is, certain web pages, known as hubs, served as large directories that were not actually authoritative in the information that they held, but were used as compilations of a broad catalog of information that led users direct to other authoritative pages. In other words, a good hub represents a page that pointed to many other pages, while a good authority represents a page that is linked by many different hubs.\n\nThe scheme therefore assigns two scores for each page: its authority, which estimates the value of the content of the page, and its hub value, which estimates the value of its links to other pages.\n\nMany methods have been used to rank the importance of scientific journals. One such method is Garfield's impact factor. Journals such as \"Science\" and \"Nature\" are filled with numerous citations, making these magazines have very high impact factors. Thus, when comparing two more obscure journals which have received roughly the same number of citations but one of these journals has received many citations from \"Science\" and \"Nature\", this journal needs be ranked higher. In other words, it is better to receive citations from an important journal than from an unimportant one.\n\nThis phenomenon also occurs in the Internet. Counting the number of links to a page can give us a general estimate of its prominence on the Web, but a page with very few incoming links may also be prominent, if two of these links come from the home pages of sites like Yahoo!, Google, or MSN. Because these sites are of very high importance but are also search engines, a page can be ranked much higher than its actual relevance.\n\nIn the HITS algorithm, the first step is to retrieve the most relevant pages to the search query. This set is called the \"root set\" and can be obtained by taking the top pages returned by a text-based search algorithm. A \"base set\" is generated by augmenting the root set with all the web pages that are linked from it and some of the pages that link to it. The web pages in the base set and all hyperlinks among those pages form a focused subgraph. The HITS computation is performed only on this \"focused subgraph\". According to Kleinberg the reason for constructing a base set is to ensure that most (or many) of the strongest authorities are included.\n\nAuthority and hub values are defined in terms of one another in a mutual recursion. An authority value is computed as the sum of the scaled hub values that point to that page. A hub value is the sum of the scaled authority values of the pages it points to. Some implementations also consider the relevance of the linked pages.\n\nThe algorithm performs a series of iterations, each consisting of two basic steps:\n\nThe Hub score and Authority score for a node is calculated with the following algorithm:\n\nHITS, like Page and Brin's PageRank, is an iterative algorithm based on the linkage of the documents on the web. However it does have some major differences:\n\nTo begin the ranking, we let formula_1 and formula_2 for each page formula_3. We consider two types of updates: Authority Update Rule and Hub Update Rule. In order to calculate the hub/authority scores of each node, repeated iterations of the Authority Update Rule and the Hub Update Rule are applied. A k-step application of the Hub-Authority algorithm entails applying for k times first the Authority Update Rule and then the Hub Update Rule.\n\nFor each formula_3, we update formula_5 to formula_6where formula_7 is all pages which link to page formula_8. That is, a page's authority score is the sum of all the hub scores of pages that point to it.\n\nFor each formula_3, we update formula_10 to formula_11where formula_12 is all pages which page formula_8 links to. That is, a page's hub score is the sum of all the authority scores of pages it points to.\n\nThe final hub-authority scores of nodes are determined after infinite repetitions of the algorithm. As directly and iteratively applying the Hub Update Rule and Authority Update Rule leads to diverging values, it is necessary to normalize the matrix after every iteration. Thus the values obtained from this process will eventually converge.\n\n \"G\" := set of pages\n\nThe hub and authority values converge in the pseudocode above.\n\nThe code below does not converge, because it is necessary to limit the number of steps that the algorithm runs for. One way to get around this, however, would be to normalize the hub and authority values after each \"step\" by dividing each authority value by the square root of the sum of the squares of all authority values, and dividing each hub value by the square root of the sum of the squares of all hub values. This is what the pseudocode above does.\n\n \"G\" := set of pages\n\n\n\n"}

He served as the Catholic Primate of All Ireland and Archbishop of Armagh from 1977 until his death. He was created a Cardinal in 1979. He was born in 1923 in Cullyhanna, and raised in Camlough, County Armagh.\n\nTomás Ó Fiaich (he began life as Thomas/Tom Fee but while a lecturer in St. Patrick's College Maynooth adopted the fully Gaelicised version) was born in Cullyhanna, South Armagh where his father was a local schoolmaster. He was educated locally before attending St Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh and then proceeded to begin his studies for the priesthood in St Peter's College, Wexford on 6 July 1948. Cardinal John D'Alton appointed him as an assistant priest in Clonfeacle parish, but after Ó Fiaich returned to full health he commenced post-graduate studies in University College, Dublin, (1948–50), receiving an MA in early and medieval Irish history. Further study followed at the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, (1950–52), culminating in Ó Fiaich receiving a licentiate in historical sciences. \n\nIn 1952 he returned to Clonfeacle where he remained as assistant priest till following summer 1953 and his appointment to the faculty of St Patrick's College, Maynooth.\n\nÓ Fiaich was an academic and noted Irish language scholar, folklorist and historian in the Pontifical University in St Patrick's College, Maynooth, the National Seminary of Ireland. From 1959 to 1974 he was Professor of Modern Irish History at the college. In this capacity he suggested to Nollaig Ó Muraíle that he begin research on Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh and his works. He \"was an inspired lecturer, an open and endearing man, who was loved by his students... Tomas O'Fiaich was my Good Samaritan\" \n\nHe served as vice president of the college from 1970 to 1974 and was then appointed college president. He held this position until 1977.\n\nFollowing the relatively early death from cancer of Dr William Cardinal Conway in April 1977, Monsignor Ó Fiaich was appointed Archbishop of Armagh by Pope Paul VI on 18 August 1977. He was consecrated bishop on 2 October 1977. The principal consecrator was the papal nuncio Archbishop Gaetano Alibrandi; the principal co-consecrators were Bishop Francis Lenny, the auxiliary Bishop of Armagh, and Bishop William Philbin, the Bishop of Down and Connor. Pope John Paul II raised Ó Fiaich to the cardinalate on 30 June 1979; he was appointed Cardinal-Priest of S. Patrizio that same day.\n\nThe first major event in Ó Fiaich's cardinalate was the first ever papal visit to the Ireland from 29 September to 1 October 1979 by Pope John Paul II. The Pope celebrated Mass before one million people in the Phoenix Park, Dublin. His major speech calling on all the organisations that were prolonging The Troubles to end their activities was made in the Archdiocese of Armagh and was followed by a visit to the Marian Shrine at Knock, County Mayo. Cardinal Ó Fiaich was at the Pope's side during the entire visit. \n\nÓ Fiaich took a more understanding, or at least a less critical, stance than other episcopal colleagues on militant republicanism in part because of his own upbringing in Crossmaglen. His approach, including visits to republican prisoners in the Maze, triggered many of these complaints but Ó Fiaich was always adamant that he had pastoral responsibilities and that the strict work of politics especially in an era of Margaret Thatcher as well Taoisigh such as Jack Lynch and Garret FitzGerald, was not his sphere. Unionists were also critical of Ó Fiaich.\n\nSome of Ó Fiaich's sternest critics were in the Irish media, notably \"The Sunday Independent\" (which had very anti-terrorism stance) and \"The Irish Times\" . He was, however, strongly defended on occasion by \"The Irish Press\" (a more nationalist paper) and \"An Phoblacht\" (which had a very pro-Sinn Féin/IRA stance).\n\nDuring the IRA hunger strikes Ó Fiaich was believed by many to have been a privately influential figure among militant republican supporters, credited with helping end the first hunger strike through direct contact with militant republicans in the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland. He visited the Maze and witnessed the \"Dirty Protest\" (where prisoners rubbed their faeces on the walls of their cells and left food to rot on cell floors, while just wearing blankets and refusing to wash, in protest at the withdrawal of Special Category Status from militant republican prisoners). He stated: \n\nWhen hunger striker Raymond McCreesh died, Ó Fiaich said: \n\nWhile the Cardinal showed deep concern for the treatment of prisoners, he was equally critical of those who used violence to further the cause of Irish nationalism.\n\nIn 1983, the Reverend David Armstrong, a Presbyterian minister, was forced to leave Limavady due to threats that followed his wishing Father Kevin Mullan's Catholic congregation \"Happy Christmas\". Cardinal Ó Fiaich gave the clergyman a cash donation to help him resettle in England.\n\nDuring his tenure, Cardinal Ó Fiaich attended many synods and meetings of the Sacred College of Cardinals. The main meetings were\n\nÓ Fiaich's re-ordering of the high Victorian neo-Gothic St. Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh proved very contentious. He had the highly decorated High Altar and rood screen replaced by a plain white Wicklow granite altar table. \n\nThough Cardinal Ó Fiaich himself wrote approvingly of the new design for the sanctuary, many others were highly critical, arguing that the new sanctuary design defaced what had been a particularly fine nineteenth-century building, with the brutal simplicity of the white oval altar contrasting with the original features surviving. One critic, writing in \"The Sunday Independent\", compared Ó Fiaich's altar to something from the set of \"Star Trek\". The altar table installed during his time as Archbishop of Armagh was subsequently removed by Dr Seán Cardinal Brady and a more classical replacement installed.\n\nÓ Fiaich died of a heart attack on the evening of 8 May 1990 while leading the annual pilgrimage by the Archdiocese of Armagh to the Marian shrine of Lourdes in France. He had arrived in France the day before and had complained of feeling ill shortly after saying Mass at the grotto in the French town. He was rushed by helicopter to a hospital in Toulouse, 125 miles away, where he died. He was aged 66. He lay in state at the cathedral in Armagh, where thousands of people lined up to pay their respects.\n\nHe was succeeded as archbishop and cardinal by a man six years his senior, Cahal Daly, then the Bishop of Down and Connor.\n\nThe Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiaich Memorial Library, a registered charity, was officially opened in Armagh 8 May 1999 by the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Dr. Marjorie Mowlam. Named after the cardinal to honour his academic interests, it contains extensive archival material about Irish folklore, heritage and history. Cardinal Ó Fiaich's private papers covering his period as archbishop and cardinal are held by the library, as are those of nine previous Roman Catholic Archbishops of Armagh dating back to the mid-eighteenth century.\n\nCultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich is named in Cardinal Ó Fiaich's honour and is an Irish language cultural centre in which the first Irish-medium secondary school in Northern Ireland, Coláiste Feirste was founded. A bust of the cardinal can be seen in An Ceathrú Póilí, the centre's book shop.\n\nThe Ancient Order of Hibernians, an exclusively Roman Catholic organisation largely (though not exclusively) based in the USA, has named its No. 14 Division in Massachusetts and No. 7 Division in New York City after the late Cardinal.\n\n\n\n"}

Guterson, who was a teacher at the time, wrote the book in the early morning hours over a ten-year period. Because of the success of the novel, however, he quit his job and began to write full-time.\n\nSet on the fictional San Piedro Island in the northern Puget Sound region of the state of Washington coast in 1954, the plot revolves around a murder case in which Kabuo Miyamoto, a Japanese American, is accused of killing Carl Heine, a respected fisherman in the close-knit community. Much of the story is told in flashbacks explaining the interaction of the various characters over the prior decades. Carl's body had been pulled from the sea, trapped in his own net, on September 16, 1954. His water-damaged watch had stopped at 1:47. The trial, held in December 1954 during a snowstorm that grips the entire island, occurs in the midst of deep anti-Japanese sentiments following World War II. Covering the case is the editor of the town's one-man newspaper, the \"San Piedro Review\", Ishmael Chambers, a World War II US Marine Corps veteran who lost an arm fighting the Japanese at the Battle of Tarawa while watching his friends die. Torn by a sense of hatred for the Japanese, Chambers struggles with his love for Kabuo's wife, Hatsue, and his conscience, wondering if Kabuo is truly innocent. Through extended flashbacks, the reader learns that Ishmael had fallen in love with Hatsue when the two attended high school together right before the war. They had been secretly dating at this time and lost their virginity to each other.\n\nSpearheading the prosecution are the town's sheriff, Art Moran, and prosecutor, Alvin Hooks. Leading the defense is the old, experienced Nels Gudmondsson. Several witnesses, including Etta Heine, Carl's mother, accuse Kabuo of murdering Carl for racial and personal reasons. Kabuo Miyamoto (a decorated war veteran of the Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team), experienced prejudice because of his ancestry, following the Imperial Japanese Navy's attack on Pearl Harbor. He accepts the murder trial as a kind of karma for his part in killing young Germans during the war.\n\nAlso involved in the trial are Horace Whaley, the town coroner, and Ole Jurgensen, an elderly man who sells his strawberry field to Carl. The strawberry field is contested in the trial. The land was originally owned by Carl Heine Sr. The Miyamotos lived in a house on the Heines' land and picked strawberries for Mr. Heine. Kabuo and Carl Heine Jr. were close friends as children. Kabuo's father eventually approached Heine Sr. about purchasing of the farm. Though Etta opposed the sale, Carl Sr. agreed. The payments were to be made over a ten-year period. However, before the last payment was made, war erupted between the US and Japan following Pearl Harbor, and all islanders of Japanese ancestry were forced to relocate to internment camps. Hatsue and her family, the Imadas, are interned in Manzanar camp in California. Under some pressure from her mother, Hatsue breaks up with Ishmael through a Dear John letter and marries Kabuo while at Manzanar. Ishmael's last thoughts before passing out on a navy hospital ship when his arm is amputated at the Battle of Tarawa are of anger towards Hatsue.\n\nIn 1944, Carl Sr. died due to a heart attack and Etta Heine sold the land to Jurgensen. When Kabuo returned after the war, he was extremely bitter towards Etta for reneging on the land sale. When Jurgensen suffered a stroke and decided to sell the farm, he was approached by Carl Heine Jr., hours before Kabuo arrived to try to buy the land back. During the trial, the disputed land is presented as a family feud and the motivation behind Carl's murder.\n\nIshmael's search of the maritime records at Point White lighthouse station reveals that on the night that Carl Heine died, a freighter, the SS \"West Corona\", had passed through the channel where Carl had been fishing at 1:42 a.m., just five minutes before his watch had stopped. Ishmael realizes that Carl was likely to have been thrown overboard by the force of the freighter's wake. Despite the bitterness he feels as Hatsue's rejected lover, Ishmael comes forward with the new information. Further evidence is collected in support of the conclusion that Carl had climbed the boat's mast to cut down a lantern, been knocked from the mast by the freighter's wake, hit his head, then fallen into the sea. The charges against Kabuo Miyamoto are dismissed. Hatsue thanks Ishmael, whom she had avoided since marrying Kabuo, and Ishmael is finally able to let his love of Hatsue go, whilst his agnosticism hardens into atheism.\n\nThe novel was published on September 12, 1994, becoming an immediate bestseller and winning 1995's PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. \"Snow Falling on Cedars\" was adapted in 1999 into a film that was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. In 2007 it was adapted for the stage by Kevin McKeon. It received its world premiere at Seattle's Book-it Repertory Theatre that same year, and a subsequent production at Oregon's Portland Center Stage in 2010.\n\nA Canadian Catholic school temporarily removed the book from its shelves due to the book's sexual content.\nThe book has been challenged, banned, or restricted in several school systems in the United States.\n\n"}

One of the larger users of circus trains was the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus (RBBX), a famous American circus formed when the Ringling Brothers Circus purchased the Barnum and Bailey Circus in 1907.\nIn 1872 the P.T. Barnum Circus had grown so large that it was decided that they would only play at large venues, and that they would travel by train. P.T. Barnum had two of his partners, William Cameron Coup and Dan Costello, come up with a system to load the circus wagons on to railroad flat cars. Using a system of inclined planes, called runs, and crossover plates between cars, they developed a system of ropes and pulleys, along with a snubber post\" to get the wagons on and off of the flat cars. They used horses to pull the wagons up the run and then would hitch a second team to pull it down the run cars (flats). The off-loading was much the same as loading, but a snubber post was used to help brake the wagons' descent down the run. That system, first used in 1872, was used by the RBBBC until its closing, although through more modern methods.\nWhen the circus switched to travel by train they began by using flatcars from the Pennsylvania Railroad, which turned out to be hazardous because the Pennsylvania Railroad's cars were in poor shape. In mid-season it was decided that they would buy their own cars, and when the P.T. Barnum Circus left Columbus, Ohio, it traveled on the first circus-owned train. It was made up of 60 cars, including 19-45 flatcars carrying about 100 wagons.\nCircus trains have proven well-suited for the transportation of heavy equipment (tents, rolling wagons, vehicles and machinery) and animals (elephants, lions, tigers and horses), despite tragic accidents over the years.\nRingling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circuses separately and together grew to dominate live entertainment through their frequent purchases of many other American circuses. In modern times, they traveled in two circus trains, the blue unit and the red unit, following an alternating two-year schedule to bring a new show to each location once a year. The RBBB circus trains were more than in length, and included living quarters for the performers and animal keepers. There were also special stock cars for the exotic animals and flatcars for the transportation of circus wagons, equipment, and even a bus used for local transportation at performance sites.\n\nThe Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus closed its doors permanently in May 2017, and its train cars were either auctioned off or scrapped not too long after. In early 2018, Kirby Family Farm, located in Florida, purchased some of the cars and planned to turn them into dormitories for kids with special needs.\n\nAnother, the last operating carnival train in the United States, is operated in the east by Strates Shows.\n\nFamous cinematic portrayals of circus trains include 1941's \"Dumbo\" by Ben Sharpsteen, starring Verna Felton and Margaret Wright, 1947's \"Fun and Fancy Free\" by Jack Kinney, Bill Roberts and Hamilton Luske, starring Edgar Bergen and Dinah Shore, 1952's \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" by Cecil B. DeMille, starring Charlton Heston, the 1983 James Bond movie \"Octopussy\", 1989's \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas and 2011's \"Water for Elephants\" based on Sara Gruen's 2006 novel of the same name, by Francis Lawrence, starring Robert Pattinson, Reese Witherspoon and Christoph Waltz.\n\n\n"}

The nuclear site of Pierrelatte includes many nuclear installations, of which the largest are the Eurodif fuel factory and the Tricastin nuclear power station.\n\nEnriched uranium is the preferred fuel for light water reactors, a common nuclear power technology.\n\nIn 1973 France, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Sweden formed the joint stock company EURODIF. Sweden withdrew from the project in 1974. In 1975 Sweden's 10 per cent share in EURODIF was transferred to Iran as a result of an arrangement between France and Iran. The French government subsidiary company Cogema and the Iranian Government established the Sofidif () enterprise with 60 per cent and 40 per cent shares, respectively. In turn, Sofidif acquired a 25 per cent share in EURODIF, through which Iran attained its 10 per cent share of EURODIF.\n\nIn 1974, the Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, Shah of Iran, lent $1 billion (and another $180 million in 1977) for the construction of the factory, in order to have the right to buy 10% of the production. Iran remains a shareholder of Eurodif via Sofidif. The Franco-Iranian consortium shareholder still owns 25% of Eurodif.\n\nThe factory, named after Georges Besse, its founder, provides uranium to forty producers of nuclear electricity, including EDF, France's largest electric power company.\n\nIn 1986, Eurodif manager Georges Besse was assassinated; the act was allegedly part of an Iranian campaign to blackmail France after pulling out of the agreement between Eurodif and Iran (see Eurodif and Iran's nuclear program); the act was also allegedly claimed by left-wing militants from Action Directe, but they denied any responsibility during their trial.\n\nNaturally occurring uranium contains 0.7% of uranium 235. Currently, it is enriched up to 5% by a gas diffusion process using uranium hexafluoride (UF). France plans to abandon the gas diffusion process currently used by the Eurodif factory for a centrifuge process. The project announced by Areva NC to make the change was the subject of a public discussion in the Rhône-Alpes region from September 1 to October 22, 2004. The advantage of the new process is that it is more energy efficient: Eurodif currently uses the power generated by all three (2,700 MW) of Tricastin's nuclear reactors for uranium enrichment, whereas the centrifuge-based plant could make similar amounts of uranium with only 50 MW.\n\nDismantling the original Eurodif facility is planned to be completed by the end of 2020.\n"}

She flew a single engine Cessna 180 (registered N1538C) christened the \"Spirit of Columbus\" and nicknamed \"Charlie.\" The trip began March 19, 1964, in Columbus, Ohio, and ended April 17, 1964, in Columbus, Ohio, and took 29 days, 21 stopovers and almost . An almost forgotten part of this flight is the \"race\" that developed between Jerrie Mock and Joan Merriam Smith who had flown from a field near San Francisco CA on March 17, 1964. Joan's departure date and flight path was the same as the aviator Amelia Earhart's last flight and though not in direct competition with each other, media coverage soon began tracking the progress of each pilot fascinated with who would complete the journey first. The story of this race is told in a book written by Taylor Phillips entitled, \"Racing to Greet the Sun, Jerrie Mock and Joan Merriam Smith Duel to Become the First Woman to Solo Around the World\". Jerrie Mock was subsequently awarded the Louis Blériot medal from the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale in 1965. In 1970 she published the story of her round-the-world flight in the book \"Three-Eight Charlie\". While that book is now out of print, a 50th anniversary edition was later published including maps, weather charts and photos. \"Three-Eight Charlie\" is a reference to the call sign, N1538C, of the Cessna 180 Skywagon Mock used to fly around the world. Before her death, Mock, mother of three children, resided in Quincy, Florida; northwest of the state capital, Tallahassee.\n\nGeraldine \"Jerrie\" Fredritz Mock was born November 22, 1925, in Newark, Ohio to Timothy and Blanche (Wright) Fredritz. Her paternal grandparents were German emigrants. During her childhood, she found that she had more in common with the boys. Her interest for flying was sparked when she was 7 years old when she and her father had the opportunity to fly in the cockpit of a Ford Trimotor airplane. In high school, she took an engineering course of which she was the only girl and decided flying was her passion. She graduated from Newark High School in 1943 and went on to attend Ohio State University. At OSU, she became a member of Phi Mu. She would leave her studies at OSU behind to wed her husband, Russell Mock in 1945.\n\nDuring her flight, Mock traveled over Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam, among other countries. After stressful days traveling over the Atlantic, Mock was greeted by the president of the Aero Club of Morocco and stayed the night in a French home, where Mock reports, \"there were no nightmares of thunderheads over the Atlantic. Dressed in red satin, I danced in marble palaces.\" Mock later journeyed to Saudi Arabia, where she landed at Dhahran Airport. In her book \"Three-Eight Charlie\", Mock says that after landing in Saudi Arabia the crowd of men around her looked puzzled. One of the men approached her aircraft. “His white-kaffiyeh-covered head nodded vehemently, and he shouted to the throng that there was no man. This brought a rousing ovation”, she recalled. Mock was quite a spectacle in Saudi Arabia where women would not be allowed to drive cars until 2017, much less fly a plane. Traveling the world gave Mock new perspective and experiences. Flying over Vietnam, she noted: \"Somewhere not far away a war was being fought, but from the sky above, all looked peaceful.\"\n\n1964\n1965\n1966\n1968\n1969\n\n\n\nA life-size bronze sculpture of Mock, sculpted by Renate Burgyan Fackler, was unveiled in the courtyard of The Works museum in Newark, Ohio on September 14, 2013. Mock's younger sister, Susan Reid, modeled for the statue while wearing Mock's knit skirt, sweater, and leather shoes that she had worn on her round-the-world flight. According to Wendy Hollinger, the publisher who reissued Mock's book about her flight, Mock did not especially like skirts, but \"was in a skirt because she thought it would be socially acceptable, especially in the Middle East.\" \n\nMock’s Cessna 180 which she flew around the world, “The Spirit of Columbus,” hangs in the Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air and Space Museum in Virginia. In June 2007, Mock flew to Chantilly, Virginia, to see “The Spirit of Columbus” for the first time in many years. Mock \"was so pleased to see her plane 'airborne' again\". The plane previously was in storage, but with the opening of the Udvar-Hazy Center, is now back on display.\n\nThe United States Air Force named a street in honor of Mock at Rickenbacker AFB (presently Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base and Rickenbacker International Airport) in Lockbourne, Ohio (near Columbus).\n\nA plaque bearing Mock's accomplishments can be found in the Tallahassee Regional Airport's Aviation Wall of Fame in Tallahassee, Florida.\n\nMock was found dead in her home in Quincy, Florida by a relative on September 30, 2014.\n\n\n"}

As of 2003 the album has sold 119,000 copies in the United States.\n\n\"Hat Full of Stars\" deviated from Lauper's pop-rock sound of previous projects and delved heavily into alternative music. It also furthered her growing penchant for writing topical songs about social issues. \n\nThe album was recorded at the Hit Factory, Sigma Sound, Messina Sound, Right Track, The Enchanted Cottage, The Ranch, and World Famous Orbit Sound. It was co-produced by dance-music artist Junior Vasquez and is highly typical of his work of the time; as such, many of the songs are held together by synthetic loops and percussion. Lyrics address issues like abortion (\"Sally's Pigeons\"), racism (\"A Part Hate\"), spousal abuse (\"Product of Misery\" and \"Broken Glass\") and incest (\"Lies\"). The track \"Product of Misery\" was inspired by a teacher of Lauper's, Bob Barrell, who described the masses of struggling people as a 'product of misery' and that misery begets misery unless the chain is broken. The song \"A Part Hate\" was conceived as an anti-apartheid song and was originally written for Lauper's second album \"True Colors\" but was not included because her label felt it would make the album too political; it already had a cover of Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" and the title track included.\n\nThe album cover was inspired by a photograph of the actress Mary Pickford, taken by photographer Nelson Evans.\n\nLauper has commented that she wishes that her vocals on the project had been sharper. She worked with a vocal coach to sharpen her vocals for her next studio album \"Sisters of Avalon\", and mentions this in the liner notes.\n\nThe album had limited success due to lack of promotion on the part of Cyndi's label. It was considered a commercial disappointment in the United States and despite some positive critical reviews it stalled at No. 112 on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart. As of 2003, the album has sold 119,000 copies in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nThe album fared better overseas, becoming most successful in Japan and France, achieving a Gold certification in both countries. In Japan, the album spent a total of 7 weeks on the albums chart, peaking at 15. In France the album debuted at 10 before reaching its peak of 9 the following week.

He became a member of the \"Byakkotai,\" a unit of the newly reorganized Aizu domain army composed mostly of boys aged 15 to 17 years, who fought in defense of Aizu during the Boshin War. \n\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, through the mediation of the Zen monk Kawai Zenjun, Yamakawa was placed in the care of Chōshū retainer Okudaira Kensuke. Yamakawa was sent by the new Meiji government to study physics at Yale University, where he was the first student from Japan to graduate. On his return to Japan, he was posted to Tokyo Imperial University working as an assistant and interpreter, and became Japan’s first Japanese professor of physics in 1879. (There had already been several foreign professors, such as Thomas Corwin Mendenhall and William Edward Ayrton.)\n\nDuring the Meiji and Taishō periods he helped found the Kyushu Institute of Technology in 1907 and served as president of Tokyo Imperial University (1901-1905 and 1913-1920), Kyushu Imperial University (1911-1913), and Kyoto Imperial University (1914-1915). He was later ennobled with the title of \"danshaku\" (baron) under the \"kazoku\" peerage system. Later in his life he was also a Privy Councilor (appointed in February 1923) and a member of the House of Peers.\n\nHe and his brother Yamakawa Hiroshi are known amongst historians of the late Edo period as authors of two monumental texts-- Kenjirō's being \"Aizu Boshin Senshi,\" which catalogues the actions of his home domain during the war. He also authored several other history texts, including \"Hoshū Aizu Byakkotai Jūkyūshi-den,\" which he wrote with fellow Aizu native Munekawa Toraji.\n\nYamakawa's sisters, Yamakawa Futaba (1844 – 1909) and Yamakawa Sutematsu (1860-1919), later Princess Ōyama Sutematsu (大山 捨松), are also well-known. Futaba, who fought in the Battle of Aizu during the Boshin War, later worked at the Tokyo Women's Normal School (東京女子高等師範学校, Tōkyō Joshi Kōtō Shihan Gakkō), the forerunner of Ochanomizu University. Sutematsu was one of five Japanese girls sent to the United States as part of the Iwakura Mission; she was the first Japanese graduate of Vassar University, and later became the wife of Imperial Japanese Army general Ōyama Iwao.\n\n\"From the Japanese Wikipedia article\"\n\n\n"}

The station calls itself \"News Radio 710.\" WNTM is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and the broadcast license is held by iHM Licenses, LLC. Its studios are located in the same building as Channel 5 WKRG-TV on Broadcast Drive in Mobile, and the transmitter is just north of downtown. (Both stations had been co-owned at one time.) WKRG-TV supplies local news and weather, while Fox News Radio supplies national newscasts.\n\nWNTM has a local wake-up show hosted by tongue-in-cheek commentator \"Uncle Henry,\" formerly of WABB, followed by nationally syndicated shows from Premiere Networks, a subsidiary of iHeartMedia. The station's lineup includes Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, America Now with Meghan McCain, Clyde Lewis, and \"Coast to Coast AM\" with George Noory. Weekends feature paid brokered programming in the morning and repeats of weekday shows. Sunday nights include syndicated shows from Bill Handel and Bill Cunningham.\n\nThe station was originally owned by movie theater owner, architect, and broadcasting pioneer Kenneth R. Giddens, whose family-owned WKRG-TV Inc. put WKRG (710 AM) on the air on September 26, 1946. It became a CBS affiliate December 15, 1947. At that time it operated with 1 KW power during the day and 250 W at night.\n\nThe station would have an FM companion broadcasting on 99.9 MHz starting on October 16, 1947 (today's WMXC), followed by television partner WKRG-TV on September 5, 1955. Like competitor WABB-FM, WKRG-FM was a simulcast of the AM station before finding its own format of beautiful music in 1965. In March 1970, the Federal Communications Commission enforced new rules preventing future radio and television ownership combinations in the same market, which allowed the stations of WKRG-TV, Inc. to remain standing, or \"grandfathered\".\n\nFor much of its history, the former CBS-affiliated WKRG had a format of middle of the road music and talk shows. Such talk shows included an afternoon program hosted by future WKRG-TV sports director Randy Patrick, but the talk radio format would soon dominate the schedule later in the 1980s as FM reigned with its superior sound. The next change for WKRG Radio in the 1980s was a new location, as WKRG-TV, Inc. moved from its long-time home on downtown Mobile's St. Louis Street to its current facility close to the city's two malls, Springdale Mall and Bel Air Mall. WKRG Radio, including both 710 AM and 99.9 FM were sold off in late 1994. A new journey awaits these two legendary stations.\n\nOn October 12, 1994, WKRG became known as WNTM, with call letters standing for \"News Talk of Mobile\", making it clear that the new owners at Capital Broadcasting want to keep the talk radio format. Along with radio programs such as \"The Rush Limbaugh Show\", some former WKRG Radio staff would stay in this midst of change. The station's owners would also inherit studio & office space on the third floor of WKRG-TV's facility. Clear Channel Communications would take ownership of 710 AM and 99.9 FM in 1997. Interesting enough, Clear Channel also owns what would become WKRG-TV's biggest rival in decades, the new NBC affiliate WPMI. After WPMI started its news operation in January 1996, the resources of this new addition to the Mobile-Pensacola news media would be put to good use for WNTM in the years to come.\nOn August 12, 2004, WNTM received another change in call letters, this time to WPMI, due to the station's close relationship with WPMI-TV. The station has also seen an expansion of local news from WPMI-TV, along with the timeslots of regularly scheduled programs. The new partnership also meant the end of affiliation with ABC News Radio, meaning no more of Paul Harvey's daily and weekend broadcasts for listeners on the central Gulf Coast. In the three-year period as WPMI, the station changed its radio network affiliation twice. After almost a year with NBC News Radio, WPMI radio became affiliated with Fox News. Ironically, WPMI-TV was affiliated with the Fox television network before joining NBC in 1996. On June 28, 2007, the call sign reverted to WNTM. On August 1, 2007, the station entered into a strategic partnership with WKRG-TV, similar to its previous relationship with WPMI-TV, gaining access to its former sister station's news and weather resources. However, the radio/tv news partnership has now been re-established with WPMI NBC 15.\n\nNumerous radio personalities have been heard over Mobile's 710 AM, including a few voices from the WKRG Radio years still around today. Until November 2007, former WKRG-FM disc jockey Scott O'Brien hosted \"Mobile's First News\" and \"Ask the Expert\" in the morning. Michael P. Sloan was a newsbreak reader and Daniel Shane McBryde hosted his own afternoon program during the first WNTM era; both are WABB veterans. Alex Mathis later joined McBryde as producer and fill-in host. Long time radio personality Yvonne Morrison hosted \"The Garden Show\" alongside reporter Charlie Moss on Saturday mornings.\n\nOvernight, the station broadcasts the syndicated \"Coast to Coast AM\" hosted by George Noory. The station also broadcasts the syndicated Saturday night program \"Somewhere In Time\" hosted by Art Bell.\n\n"}
{"id": "1851370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851370", "title": "Neurosarcoidosis", "text": "Neurosarcoidosis\n\nNeurosarcoidosis (sometimes shortened to neurosarcoid) refers to a type of sarcoidosis, a condition of unknown cause featuring granulomas in various tissues, in this type involving the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Neurosarcoidosis can have many manifestations, but abnormalities of the cranial nerves (a group of twelve nerves supplying the head and neck area) are the most common. It may develop acutely, subacutely, and chronically. Approximately 5–10 percent of people with sarcoidosis of other organs (e.g. lung) develop central nervous system involvement. Only 1 percent of people with sarcoidosis will have neurosarcoidosis alone without involvement of any other organs. Diagnosis can be difficult, with no test apart from biopsy achieving a high accuracy rate. Treatment is with immunosuppression. The first case of sarcoidosis involving the nervous system was reported in 1905.\n\nAbnormalities of the cranial nerves are present in 50–70 percent of cases. The most common abnormality is involvement of the facial nerve, which may lead to reduced power on one or both sides of the face (65 percent resp 35 percent of all cranial nerve cases), followed by reduction in visual perception due to optic nerve involvement. Rarer symptoms are double vision (oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve or abducens nerve), decreased sensation of the face (trigeminal nerve), hearing loss or vertigo (vestibulocochlear nerve), swallowing problems (glossopharyngeal nerve) and weakness of the shoulder muscles (accessory nerve) or the tongue (hypoglossal nerve). Visual problems may also be the result of papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) due to obstruction by granulomas of the normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation.\n\nSeizures (mostly of the tonic-clonic/\"grand mal\" type) are present in about 15 percent and may be the presenting phenomenon in 10 percent.\n\nMeningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain) occurs in 3–26 percent of cases. Symptoms may include headache and nuchal rigidity (being unable to bend the head forward). It may be acute or chronic.\n\nAccumulation of granulomas in particular areas of the brain can lead to abnormalities in the function of that area. For instance, involvement of the internal capsule would lead to weakness in one or two limbs on one side of the body. If the granulomas are large, they can exert a mass effect and cause headache and increase the risk of seizures. Obstruction of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, too, can cause headaches, visual symptoms (as mentioned above) and other features of raised intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus.\n\nInvolvement of the spinal cord is rare, but can lead to abnormal sensation or weakness in one or more limbs, or cauda equina symptoms (incontinence to urine or stool, decreased sensation in the buttocks).\n\nGranulomas in the pituitary gland, which produces numerous hormones, is rare but leads to any of the symptoms of hypopituitarism: amenorrhoea (cessation of the menstrual cycle), diabetes insipidus (dehydration due to inability to concentrate the urine), hypothyroidism (decreased activity of the thyroid) or hypocortisolism (deficiency of cortisol).\n\nPsychiatric problems occur in 20 percent of cases; many different disorders have been reported, e.g. depression and psychosis. Peripheral neuropathy has been reported in up to 15 percent of cases of neurosarcoidosis.\n\nOther symptoms due to sarcoidosis of other organs may be uveitis (inflammation of the uveal layer in the eye), dyspnoea (shortness of breath), arthralgia (joint pains), lupus pernio (a red skin rash, usually of the face), erythema nodosum (red skin lumps, usually on the shins), and symptoms of liver involvement (jaundice) or heart involvement (heart failure).\n\nSarcoidosis is a disease of unknown cause that leads to the development of granulomas in various organs. While the lungs are typically involved, other organs may equally be affected. Some subforms of sarcoidosis, such as Löfgren syndrome, may have a particular precipitant and have a specific course. It is unknown which characteristics predispose sarcoidosis patients to brain or spinal cord involvement.\n\nThe diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis often is difficult. Definitive diagnosis can only be made by biopsy (surgically removing a tissue sample). Because of the risks associated with brain biopsies, they are avoided as much as possible. Other investigations that may be performed in any of the symptoms mentioned above are computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, lumbar puncture, electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potential (EP) studies. If the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is suspected, typical X-ray or CT appearances of the chest may make the diagnosis more likely; elevations in angiotensin-converting enzyme and calcium in the blood, too, make sarcoidosis more likely. In the past, the Kveim test was used to diagnose sarcoidosis. This now obsolete test had a high (85 percent) sensitivity, but required spleen tissue of a known sarcoidosis patient, an extract of which was injected into the skin of a suspected case.\n\nOnly biopsy of suspicious lesions in the brain or elsewhere is considered useful for a definitive diagnosis of neurosarcoid. This would demonstrate granulomas (collections of inflammatory cells) rich in epithelioid cells and surrounded by other immune system cells (e.g. plasma cells, mast cells). Biopsy may be performed to distinguish mass lesions from tumours (e.g. gliomas).\n\nMRI with gadolinium enhancement is the most useful neuroimaging test. This may show enhancement of the pia mater or white matter lesions that may resemble the lesions seen in multiple sclerosis.\n\nLumbar puncture may demonstrate raised protein level, pleiocytosis (i.e. increased presence of both lymphocytes and neutrophil granulocytes) and oligoclonal bands. Various other tests (e.g. ACE level in CSF) have little added value.\n\nSome recent papers propose to classify neurosarcoidosis by likelihood:\n\nNeurosarcoidosis, once confirmed, is generally treated with glucocorticoids such as prednisolone. If this is effective, the dose may gradually be reduced (although many patients need to remain on steroids long-term, frequently leading to side-effects such as diabetes or osteoporosis). Methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, cyclophosphamide, pentoxifylline, thalidomide and infliximab have been reported to be effective in small studies. In patients unresponsive to medical treatment, radiotherapy may be required. If the granulomatous tissue causes obstruction or mass effect, neurosurgical intervention is sometimes necessary. Seizures can be prevented with anticonvulsants, and psychiatric phenomena may be treated with medication usually employed in these situations.\n\nOf the phenomena occurring in neurosarcoid, only facial nerve involvement is known to have a good prognosis and good response to treatment. Long-term treatment is usually necessary for all other phenomena. The mortality rate is estimated at 10 percent\n\nSarcoidosis has a prevalence of 40 per 100,000 in the general population. However, though those with the GG genotype at rs1049550 in the ANXA11 gene were found to have 1.5–2.5 times higher odds of sarcoidosis compared to those with the AG genotype, while those with the AA genotype had about 1.6 times lower odds. Furthermore, those with Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) may be at even higher risk. One study of 80 CVID patients found eight of these had sarcoidosis, suggesting as high a prevalence in CVID populations as one in 10. Given that less than 10 percent of those with sarcoidosis will have neurological involvement, and possibly later on in their disease course, neurosarcoidosis has a prevalence of less than four per 100,000.\n\nSarcoidosis most commonly affects young adults of both sexes, although studies have reported more cases in females. Incidence is highest for individuals younger than 40 and peaks in the age-group from 20 to 29 years; a second peak is observed for women over 50.\n\nSarcoidosis occurs throughout the world in all races with an average incidence of 16.5/100,000 in men and 19/100,000 in women. The disease is most prevalent in Northern European countries and the highest annual incidence of 60/100,000 is found in Sweden and Iceland. In the United States sarcoidosis is more common in people of African descent than Caucasians, with annual incidence reported as 35.5 and 10.9/100,000, respectively. Sarcoidosis is less commonly reported in South America, Spain, India, Canada, and the Philippines. There may be a higher susceptibility to sarcoidosis in those with coeliac disease. An association between the two disorders has been suggested.\n\nThe differing incidence across the world may be at least partially attributable to the lack of screening programs in certain regions of the world and the overshadowing presence of other granulomatous diseases, such as tuberculosis, that may interfere with the diagnosis of sarcoidosis where they are prevalent.\nThere may also be differences in the severity of the disease between people of different ethnicities. Several studies suggest that the presentation in people of African origin may be more severe and disseminated than for Caucasians, who are more likely to have asymptomatic disease.\n\nManifestation appears to be slightly different according to race and sex. Erythema nodosum is far more common in men than in women and in Caucasians than in other races. In Japanese patients, ophthalmologic and cardiac involvement are more common than in other races.\n\nSarcoidosis is one of the few pulmonary diseases with a higher prevalence in non-smokers.\n\nThe American television personality and actress Karen Duffy wrote \"Model Patient: My Life As an Incurable Wise-Ass\" on her experiences with neurosarcoidosis.\n"}
{"id": "1851372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851372", "title": "Marvin Hagler vs. Thomas Hearns", "text": "Marvin Hagler vs. Thomas Hearns\n\nMarvelous Marvin Hagler vs. Thomas Hearns (originally billed as \"The Fight\", referred to afterward as \"The War\"), was a world middleweight championship boxing match between undisputed champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler and challenger Thomas Hearns, the world junior middleweight champion, who had gone up in weight for the bout. Won by Hagler by third round knockout, the fight is considered by many to be among the finest boxing matches in history, due to its constant action, drama, and violent back-and-forth exchanges.\n\nBy 1985, Marvelous Marvin Hagler had been the undisputed champion of the middleweight division since September 27, 1980, after having been widely regarded as the No. 1 challenger for much of the late 1970s. His first two shots at the world middleweight title resulted in controversy: the first was an unpopular draw against then-champion Vito Antuofermo in 1979 (allowing Antuofermo to retain the title), and the second was a three-round technical knockout (TKO) of Alan Minter, in London, which led to a riot by Minter's fans. The hard road to the middleweight championship, however, may have helped motivate Hagler to remain dominant during his reign. Hagler was renowned for his conditioning and durability, suffering only one official knockdown in his career, against Juan Domingo Roldan, an incident Hagler always insisted should have been ruled a slip. By the time he fought Thomas Hearns, he had defended the title ten times, winning all but one by knockout; the sole Hagler defense that went the distance was a 15-round decision victory over Roberto Durán. Hagler was then approaching the middleweight record of 14 title defenses, held by Carlos Monzón.\n\nWhen Hagler vs. Hearns took place, Hearns had recently moved up from the welterweight to the junior middleweight to the middleweight division. Hearns was regarded as one of the hardest punchers of all time, winning 30 of his first 32 bouts by knockout. In Hearns's first title shot in 1980, he scored a spectacular second-round knockout over WBA champion Pipino Cuevas. Hearns defended that title three times before meeting Sugar Ray Leonard in a thrilling fight dubbed \"The Showdown.\" Hearns lost by technical knockout in the 14th round despite leading on all three scorecards. He then successfully campaigned at junior middleweight, winning the WBC title from Wilfred Benítez, and defeating Roberto Durán. Hearns defeated several middleweights during this period, including Marcos Geraldo by first-round knockout. Geraldo had gone the distance against both Leonard and Hagler.\n\nGiven the pair's renowned punching power and the way both men had won their respective fights coming into the bout, it garnered significant media attention and fan interest around the world. It was held at the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada on April 15, 1985. In the United States and Puerto Rico, it was broadcast by HBO (in Puerto Rico, also by Wapa canal 4) with Barry Tompkins, Sugar Ray Leonard and Larry Merchant, while Curt Gowdy served as host. Al Michaels and Al Bernstein acted as commentators for the closed circuit television for Top Rank. In the UK the fight was shown on ITV with Reg Gutteridge and Donald Curry commentating.\n\nHearns received a massage before the fight, much to the chagrin of his trainer Emanuel Steward. In HBO's \"Legendary Nights: The Tale of Hagler-Hearns\", Steward stated that he felt the massage weakened Hearns' legs during the fight and led him to adopt a more aggressive approach than he normally would have.\n\nHagler, normally a slow starter, stormed Hearns from the opening bell, landing with many devastating right hands eventually pinning him to the ropes. Hearns threw his devastating right hand to Hagler's chin, stunning Hagler for a moment before Hagler was able to tie him up in a clinch. Seconds later, however, the two were trading power punches, with Hagler trying to get inside and to pin Hearns to the ropes again. In the process, he succeeded in stunning Hearns with a hard left hand. Hearns tied up Hagler again and tried to slow the pace by boxing rather than trading power punches with Hagler, who was still the aggressor. This lasted for only a moment, however. Before long the two once again started to trade power punches. (During these exchanges Hearns broke his right hand.) The slugfest continued for the better part of the next two and a half minutes as both fighters traded heavy blows with little regard for defense or pacing. Hagler developed a cut on his forehead but didn't slow as he pinned Hearns to the ropes and meted out more punishment, eventually hurting Hearns at the end of the round. Sportscaster Barry Tompkins, doing the blow-by-blow commentary for HBO's broadcast of the fight, yelled out, \"This is still only the first round!\" as the fighters traded heavy shots at round's end. Al Bernstein remarked, \"Perhaps one of the best opening rounds in middleweight history!\" It is considered by \"The Ring\" magazine to be the greatest round in boxing history, and it won round of the year honors for 1985. In a subsequent HBO broadcast featuring both Hagler and Hearns in studio commenting on the fight, Hearns revealed, \"that first round took everything I had, man.\" When asked in the ring after the bout if he was hurt by Hearns' first right hand, a blow that caused him to step back and then fall into a clinch, Hagler commented, \"He definitely tried to put the bomb on me... . He can punch... .\" The scorecards were split with Reno judge Herb Santos scoring the round 10-9 for Hagler, along with U.K judge Harry Gibbs while Dick Young of California had Hearns ahead 10-9. It was described as a war zone for both fighters.\n\nBy the beginning of the second round, it looked as though Hearns had no legs under him, as he slowed the pace by boxing Hagler. Hearns stumbled several times as he attempted to move around the ring and change direction, prompting HBO commentator Sugar Ray Leonard to note, \"I don't like the way Tommy's moving...a little rubbery-legged.\" In the studio broadcast of the fight, Hearns commented, \"My legs were gone, man. Even before I came out to fight, my legs felt weak.\" Hagler experimented by switching to orthodox style for a moment, but switched back to southpaw, as he found more success countering Hearns' jab. By the end of the round, Hagler pinned Hearns to the ropes, successfully landing a volley of punches. The action in round two had slowed from the blistering pace of round one. Judges Herb Santos and Harry Gibbs again scored the round 10-9 for Hagler while judge Dick Young scored the round 10-9 for Hearns.\n\nIn round three, Hearns again tried to set the pace. About a minute into the round, the cut on Hagler's forehead inflicted in the first round opened up, resulting in a tremendous flow of blood down the middleweight champion's face. \n\nReferee Richard Steele halted the action to have the ringside physician examine Hagler. He informed Steele, \"No the cut's not bothering his sight, let him go.\" Facing the new threat of losing the fight via stoppage on cuts, Hagler attacked Hearns with the aggression of the first round. A tremendous overhand left to the head drove Hearns back to the ropes. Hearns backed away, smiling so as to suggest the punch had not hurt him. Hagler landed a hard right hook high on Hearns' head. The blow staggered Hearns, who awkwardly stumbled backwards into the ropes, Hagler running after him in hot pursuit. The champion smashed a vicious right hand to Hearns' chin. Hearns went limp and fell forward, as Hagler landed two uppercuts. As Hearns fell face first to the canvas, Sugar Ray Leonard yelled into his microphone \"He's gone...he's gone!\" \n\nHearns staggered to his feet at the count of nine, but he was unable to continue. Referee Steele stopped the bout as he held Hearns upright. The image of a blood-soaked Hagler being carried around the ring in victory by his handlers and Hearns being carried back to his corner in semi-consciousness remains to this day a graphic testimony of the intensity of \"The War.\" It was widely regarded as the pinnacle of Marvin Hagler's career and cemented his legacy as one of the greatest middleweights of all time. At the time of the stoppage, judges Herb Santos and Harry Gibbs had Hagler ahead 20-18 while judge Dick Young had Hearns ahead 20-18.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the fight, Donald Curry (who was working for British television) was highly critical of the loser. He said \"Tommy fought the wrong fight. He should have started cautiously, lose the first couple of rounds. Don't get into a dogfight, but that's what he did. He got into a dogfight with Marvin and he lost.\"\n\nBritish fight publication Boxing News called it \"eight minutes of mayhem\", while \"The Ring\" called the fight \"the most electrifying eight minutes ever,\" and it won fight of the year for 1985, despite lasting only three rounds.\n\nReferee: Richard Steele of Las Vegas, Nevada\nJudges: Herb Santos of Reno, Nevada, Harry Gibbs of Britain, Dick Young of California.\n"}

It is a coming of age tale set in Mississippi in the 1970s. The film gained Wood a young actor's award.\n\nStephen, a shell-shocked Vietnam veteran, returns from a mental hospital, which he entered voluntarily because he was suffering from nightmares about the war and had in consequence lost three jobs in a row. After having been treated and finally coming home again, he gets a new job as custodial engineer at a grammar school, but loses it again within less than one week because of a law forbidding people who spent time in a mental hospital to work within the vicinity of children. However, the Simmons family desperately needs money, so Stephen continues looking for work, and finds a job picking potatoes. There he makes friends with a man called Moe Henry, with whose help he succeeds in obtaining a job working in a mine - his best one yet.\n\nIn the meantime, the twins Lidia and Stu try to get away from the dreary reality of their lives. They find a tree in a forest close to their house and decide to build a tree house there. At first they and their friends argue over who has to construct it and who is allowed to use it; the three boys - Stu, Chet and Marsh - want it all to themselves, while the girls - Lidia, Elvadine and Amber - want them to work on it and share it afterwards. After several deals, they agree to build the tree house together. The girls get everything they need from the garbage heap belonging to the Lipnickis, a neighboring family with a reputation for bullying, who have a grudge against the Simmons and their friends. Unfortunately Billy, the youngest of the Lipnicki kids, discovers Lidia, Elvadine and Amber on his father's territory, so the girls have to pay him to keep quiet, but later after he falls under a candy coma his brothers force him to betray Lidia's secret.\n\nWhile the children are busy building their tree house, Stephen and Moe are caught in a collapse as they drain water out of a cavern. Moe is caught under falling rubble, but Stephen, who in Vietnam had to leave his best friend to die in order to be rescued himself, is determined to save him, even if it costs him his own life. He frees Moe, but is hit by falling rocks himself, and though the two men are both rescued, Stephen is badly hurt and comatose, being put on life-support in the hospital.\n\nWhile Stu and Lidia fear for their father's life, the Lipnickis find the treehouse and take it over, stealing the lock and key, which belonged to Stephen. However, they agree to return them if Stu can win a bet - swimming a lap around the inside of a water-tower while it drains - which he does. The children can keep the place, but not before the Lipnickis throw the key onto the rotted, treacherous roof of the water-tower, telling Stu that if he wants it, he can get it back himself. Shortly afterwards, their father is taken off life-support, and dies. When the kids run away from home to the tree house, they discover that the Lipnickis have returned. In the fight that erupts between them, the tree house is destroyed. Meanwhile, Billy Lipnicki protests against all the fighting, asking why they can't share the fort, but is ignored. He takes it on himself to go to the water tower to retrieve the key, but the roof caves in just as Stu and the others find him, and he almost drowns in the water tower. Stu rescues and resuscitates him together with Lidia, and Billy tells them he saw an angel, one who \"looked like [Stu,] only bigger,\" (implied to be Stephen) who told him he had to stay on Earth and take care of his family.\n\nFrom that time on the Lipnickis stop fighting with the others and stay out of their way, except for Billy, who becomes a good friend to them. The twins and their friends start to rebuild the tree house, but give it up after a couple of days due to lack of interest.

According to the Old Testament it was to Nahshon that Moses gave control of the Tribe of Judah, and it is thus from him that many of the Kings of Judah are descended. \n\nRaymond E.

The eleventh satellite of ISRO in IRS series. The satellite was built, launched and maintained by the Indian Space Research Organisation. Weighing around 1560 kg at launch, its applications will mainly be towards cartography in India. It was launched by PSLV-C6, on 5 May 2005 at 04:44:00 UTC from the newly built Second Launch Pad at Sriharikota. Images from the satellite will be available from GeoEye for worldwide distribution. The satellite covers the entire globe in 1867 orbits on a 126-day cycle. Adjacent paths are covered by a separation of eleven days.\n\nCartosat-1 carries two state-of-the-art panchromatic (PAN) cameras that take black and white stereoscopic pictures of the Earth in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The swath covered by these high resolution PAN cameras is 30 km and their spatial resolution is 2.5 metres.\n\nDepartment of Space, Government of India, has launched a series of satellites for Earth's resource management and monitoring. These satellites have been very successful in providing data in various scales ranging from 1:1 Million to 1:12,500 scale. Each of the Indian Remote Sensing satellite missions ensured data continuity while introducing improvements in the spatial, spectral and radiometric resolutions. Considering increase demand for large scale and topographic mapping data DOS launched the Cartosat-1 in 2005. Cartosat-1 is dedicated to stereo viewing for large scale mapping and terrain modelling.\n\nThe Cartosat-1 satellite has two panchromatic cameras with 2.5 m spatial resolution, to acquire two images simultaneously, one forward (PAN FORE) looking at +26° and one aft (PAN AFT) of the satellite at -5° for near instantaneous stereo data. The time difference between the acquisitions of the same scene by the two cameras is about 52 seconds. The spacecraft body is steerable to compensate the Earth rotation effect and to force both fore and aft cameras to look at the same ground strip when operated in stereo mode. The cameras are mounted on the satellite in such a way that near simultaneous imaging of the same area from two different angles is possible. This facilitates the generation of accurate three-dimensional maps. The cameras are steerable across the direction of the satellite's movement to facilitate the imaging of an area more frequently.\n\nThe images taken by Cartosat-1 cameras are compressed, encrypted, formatted and transmitted to the ground stations. The images are reconstructed from the data received at the ground stations. The National Remote Sensing Centre is responsible for acquisition, processing of data relayed by the Cartosat-1. A spherical Phased Array Antenna with steerable beam is used to transmit the data to the required ground station. A solid state recorder with 120 Gb capacity to store about 9 minutes of payload data is available for global operation of the payloads. The stored images can be transmitted when the satellite comes within the visibility zone of a ground station.\n\nEach Panchromatic camera consists of three 3 mirror off-axis all reflective telescope with primary, secondary and tertiary mirrors. These mirrors are made from special zerodur glass blanks and are light weighted to about 60%. These mirrors are polished to an accuracy of l/80 and are coated with enhanced AlO coating. In order to meet the high resolution and the swath requirement a 12K, 7 µm linear array CCD is used as a detector.\n\n\nThe revisit rate for Cartosat-1 is five days.\n\nThe sensor collects data with a 10-bit sensitivity.\n\n30 km (PAN-F) and 25 km (PAN-A)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1851388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851388", "title": "Building 429", "text": "Building 429\n\nBuilding 429 is an American Christian rock band from Fayetteville, North Carolina. Their name is derived from a Biblical passage known as Ephesians 4:29, which, in the New International Version of the Bible, reads as follows: \"Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.\" The band members originated from Snyder Memorial Baptist Church and various areas in North Carolina as well as Texas.\n\nThey were named as the Gospel Music Association 2005 New Artist of the Year.\n\nIn late 1999, bassist Scotty Beshears and guitarist/vocalist Jason Roy met in North Carolina at the final performance of Roy's band All Too Familiar. Beshears had formerly been involved with Elijah's Ride, another independent band. They teamed up with drummer Christian Fuhrer to form a new band which blended modern pop-rock music with Christian-themed lyrics. The trio began to perform under the name \"Building 429\".\n\nAccording to Jason Roy, the band's name originated from a youth group. Roy's wife Cortni had once belonged to a youth group that had a system called the \"429 Challenge,\" based on Ephesians 4:29. Whenever someone in the group spoke negatively about another, others were allowed to issue a verbal \"four twenty-nine.\" This resulted in the offender having to say something nice to the person that was offended. The band members took this challenge and created a name around it - building one another up, hence, \"Building 429\".\n\nThroughout the year 2000, Building 429 held a relentless touring schedule, with over 100 shows played and 3,000 copies of their first (self-titled) CD sold. In 2001, they deepened their sound by adding a second guitarist, Paul Bowden, to their lineup. Further success saw the band place first on Flicker Records' A&R online website and forum. Much of the band's early success can be attributed to their extensive touring schedule and tendency to write and perform upbeat, commercially-friendly pop-rock songs.\n\nIn the summer of 2002, Building 429 released the EP \"Preflight\", featuring three rough-mixed recordings from their forthcoming second independent release and four acoustic demos. This EP was only available at live shows and on the band's website. In the fall of 2002, the band's second full-length independent album, entitled \"Flight\", was released. Initially packaged as a CD-R in a sleeve with no artwork (save for a thermal printed disc label), the album was sold at shows and through the band's website. In 2003, the album was re-titled \"Building 429\" and was professionally pressed and repackaged in a full-sized jewel case with complete artwork. 2002 ended with Saul Johnson replacing Chris Fuhrer as drummer.\n\nIn 2003, Building 429 continued to tour in and around North Carolina promoting their music and independent album. When Saul Johnson left the band mid-year, Michael Anderson was hired as drummer. Anderson had formerly played for Remember Jonah, a North Carolina based Christian rock band that had played with Building 429 earlier in the year. During the summer, Building 429 joined rock worship band Sonicflood on tour. This experience would garner the band national exposure, leading to a record deal with Warner Music Group label Word Records. Studio work immediately began on the band's major-label debut album.\n\n\"Glory Defined\", Building 429's first nationally serviced radio single, rose to No. 1 on eight combined Christian AC and CHR charts in early 2004, remaining No. 1 on Christian Radio Weekly's (CRW) AC chart for ten consecutive weeks and claiming the spot faster than any single in the history of the publication. The song was the title track from the \"Glory Defined EP\", released April 6, 2004. The EP featured three full-mix tracks (the title track, \"Free\", as well as \"Show Me Love\") and two \"unplugged\" songs, \"The Space In Between Us\" and \"All You Ask of Me\". A second, AC mix version of \"Glory Defined\" was also on the EP. On July 27, 2004, Building 429's national debut, \"Space In Between\", was released. Produced by Jim Cooper, the album gave three more radio hits, including \"Above It All\", \"The Space In Between Us\" and \"No One Else Knows\". The release of the album was followed by major touring with artists such as Jeremy Camp, Tree63, and Sonicflood.\n\nBuilding 429 received four Dove Award nominations and was honored as New Artist of the Year by the Gospel Music Association in 2005. Touring also continued alongside artists Todd Agnew, BarlowGirl, Casting Crowns and Paul Colman. An expanded edition of \"Space in Between\" was released in August 2005, which included the full original album plus two tracks from the \"Glory Defined EP\" (\"All You Ask of Me\" and \"Free\"), the AC mix of \"Glory Defined\", a radio mix of \"No One Else Knows\" and a cover of Chris Tomlin's \"Famous One\". Early in 2005, Jesse Garcia (formerly of Afterglo) was asked to fill in for guitarist Paul Bowden after Bowden suffered an elbow injury during an autograph session. When Bowden returned, the band decided to keep Garcia on as a third guitarist and keyboardist, allowing lead vocalist Jason Roy to concentrate more on singing during concerts. By the fall of 2005, the band was back in the studio to record their second album, \"Rise\".\n\nProduced by Monroe Jones, \"Rise\" (released March 14, 2006) featured a heavier sound more in line with the band's live performances. The first singles to be released from the record included \"Searching For a Savior\", \"Fearless\" and \"I Belong to You\". The album also included guest vocals from former dc Talk member Michael Tait on the track \"Empty\" and a medley of Blessid Union of Souls' hit \"I Believe\" and Andraé Crouch's \"Jesus is the Answer\". In January 2006 it was announced that guitarist Paul Bowden would be leaving the band at the end of the month to pursue other areas of ministry.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Rise\", Building 429 headlined their own tour with TAIT, the band fronted by former dc Talk member Michael Tait. Parts of the tour also featured Travel the Road missionaries Tim Scott and Will Decker. In September 2006, the band returned to the studio to begin recording the follow-up album to \"Rise\". The end of 2006 saw Building 429 travel to Germany for their first overseas tour; shows were performed in Heidelberg, Hanau, Baumholder, and Denmark.\n\nIn January 2007, the band officially announced through its e-mail list, website and MySpace page that bassist and band founder Scotty Beshears had left the band to pursue \"another chapter\" in his life. Touring bassist Aaron Branch was then hired; however, the band officially remains a threesome according to its MySpace page and website. Recording continued throughout January for Building 429's third major studio release, entitled \"Iris to Iris\". \"Grace That is Greater\", a track from the album, was made available as a digital single through the iTunes music service on March 6, 2007. During the spring of 2007, Building 429 joined another former dc Talk member, TobyMac, on the \"Portable Sounds Tour\", which also featured Thousand Foot Krutch and Family Force 5.\n\n\"Iris to Iris\", released May 1, 2007 and produced by Brown Bannister, took the band's album lineup in a different direction. According to the band's MySpace page, Jason Roy (principal songwriter) felt that initial songwriting sessions were not turning out material that was right for the band or the project. The band \"sensed that God was calling them in a new direction.\" After praying about the circumstances and the music they were creating, the band made the decision to strictly focus the songs on God. After that, according to Roy, \"the songs just started to flow. It was the easiest, most fulfilling, and most fun songwriting process we have ever experienced.\" The resulting 11-track \"Iris to Iris\" became a collection of original worship songs and two hymn reworkings (\"Grace That is Greater\" and \"Search Me O God\"), making for a mellower and more ethereal-sounding record than past recordings from the group. Building 429 also saw a change in writing, as band members Michael Anderson and Jesse Garcia joined Jason Roy in the songwriting process, along with veteran Christian songwriter Chris Eaton (Amy Grant, Point of Grace, and Jaci Velasquez).\n\nIn May 2007 the band embarked on a month-long schedule of tour dates with up-and-coming band Jackson Waters to promote \"Iris to Iris\". After performing a few festivals in the summer, Building 429 continued with a second leg of their touring with Jackson Waters, adding and 2006 GMA New Artist of the Year The Afters to the performance lineup. Touring continued in 2008 with Pillar, Wavorly and Brooke Barrettsmith. on Pillar's \"For the Love of the Game\" tour (February 22 – April 6), and with Remedy Drive and Bread of Stone on the LifeLight Communications' \"Lifelight\" tour (April 9–19).\n\nOn February 16, 2008, Building 429 announced a fan contest on its official Myspace page. A link was provided to a contest Web page which listed four requirements, of which fans with Myspace profiles were asked to complete two. These requirements included adding a Building 429 rotating web banner to the contestant's profile, adding the song \"Singing Over Me\" to the contestant's profile, putting Building 429 in the contestant's \"Top 8 Friends\" and changing the default profile picture to Building 429’s default profile picture. Each Monday beginning February 18, 2008, a contestant was chosen as the weekly winner and received a T-shirt, a copy of the \"Iris to Iris\" album, a signed poster and a drumstick. Winners were announced by name in blog posts on Building 429's Myspace page. On April 14, a grand prize winner was chosen to win an iPod Nano.\n\nOn July 3, 2008, the band released \"\", a greatest hits collection from the albums under the Word Records label. The CD contained all previously released tracks.\n\nA press release dated September 10, 2008 stated that Building 429 had moved to INO Records after almost five years with Word Records. The self-titled album Building 429 was released on October 21, 2008 to mark the \"new beginning\" of the band with the new label. \"End of Me\" was the first single from the new album to be released to Christian AC and CHR radio outlets, followed by \"Always\". Soul-Audio, a Christian music publication, granted the album an average score, speaking highly of the band by saying \"Forget the future—the present is pretty bright for this trio.\"\n\nBuilding 429 started out with Essential Records by releasing \"Listen to the Sound\". Throughout 2011 and 2012, Building 429 released new singles \"Listen to the Sound\", \"Right Beside You\" and \"Where I Belong\". The single, \"Where I Belong\" was No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" NCA charts and was named the 2013 Billboard Magazine Christian Song of the Year.\n\nOn June 4, 2013, Building 429 released \"We Won't Be Shaken\", their eighth studio album. The CD debuted at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Christian Albums chart.\n\nOn April 29, 2015 (in celebration of 4/29), Building 429 released \"Impossible\" as the single for their ninth studio album, \"Unashamed\", which was released in September 2015.\n\nCurrent\n\nFormer\n\n\nIn 2005, Building 429 was nominated to three Dove Awards at the 36th GMA Dove Awards: New Artist of the Year, Song of the Year (\"Glory Defined\"), and Rock/Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year for the same song. It ended up winning New Artist of the Year.\n\nAt the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, their We Won't Be Shaken was nominated for \"Best Contemporary Christian Music Album.\"\n\n"}

Despite a widening of suffrage and a change in the government's policies concerning industrial disputes (in favour of workers), a general strike was called in support of large demonstrations in many major industrialised towns, which in turn had been caused by the shooting of three socialist protesters. However, due to the nature of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), the strike was uncoordinated and rioters were headed off by government troops.\n\nThe situation was regarded so grave that the government deployed “100,000 soldiers,” including many reservists, resulting in the death of 17 rioters and a thousand injured. The widespread riots paralyzed almost every major city for two days. The would-be revolutionaries briefly seized control of “entire towns in central Italy; railways were cut, bridges destroyed,” while the insurgents displayed red flags on public buildings.\n\nThe riots during Red Week frightened the lower middle classes, and proved that Italy's problems of unification were more than just the growing pains of a young nation. Italy's Wars of Unification (Risorgimento) and following trade measures had failed to iron out inequalities between its industrialised North and agricultural South - the needs of both could not simultaneously be satisfied by Giolitti's liberal politics.\n\nBenito Mussolini was the only prominent Marxist to defend the popular street uprising that was referred to in Italy as \"Settimana Rossa\" (Red Week). Mussolini considered Red Week as his “greatest achievement and disappointment” during his leadership of the Italian Socialist Party, regarding the strike as the pinnacle of radical class struggle but also as an abysmal failure. Although Mussolini hailed Red Week as the beginning of the end of capitalism in Italy, it became evident to many within the labor and socialist movement that rebellion, general strikes and revolutionary “myths” did not constitute revolution. The strikes resulted in making reactionary elements of the nation stronger as the middle class and conservatives rallied behind their government to put down the rebellion, while the socialists were left with disappointment and recrimination for engaging in an unsuccessful uprising. The failure of Red Week provided evidence of the severe limitations of current class socialism. Mussolini argued that Italy’s industrial sector was not mature enough and had neither a fully developed modern bourgeoisie nor a modern proletarian movement. \n\nFollowing the events of June 1914, editorials in Benito Mussolini's political journal \"Avanti!\" urged that more drastic measures be taken against the Italian government, and Italy's joining of the First World War subsequent to the Red Week gave huge credence to Mussolini's rhetoric against the sycophantic government, which had presented itself as an easy target for its entry into the Great War.\nAfter Mussolini’s Fascist regime was overthrown in 1943-45 it was not difficult for a certain number of “ex-Blackshirts to swing to left-wing political extremism”, sometimes joining Antifa organizations. Sharing a common hostility toward democratic parliamentary government, adherents of fascism and communism often found themselves appealing to the “same kinds of alienated people.”\n"}

Medieval great halls were the ceremonial centre of the household and were not private at all; the gentlemen attendants and the servants would come and go all the time. The great chamber was at the dais end of the hall, usually up a staircase. It was the first room which offered the lord of the household some privacy from his own staff, albeit not total privacy. In the Middle Ages the great chamber was an all-purpose reception and living room. The family might take some meals in it, though the great hall was the main eating room. In modest manor houses it sometimes also served as the main bedroom. \n\nBy the seventeenth century communal meals in the hall had been abandoned and the great chamber was the best dining room. There was often a more modest room called the parlour, where the family took its meals when eating alone. Large houses gradually acquired a greater range of specialised living rooms, such as libraries, drawing rooms, and music rooms. By the early 18th century, great chambers had been replaced by rooms called \"saloons\", and these soon lost their function as dining rooms.\n\nMany great chambers survive. Hardwick Hall has a very large and little-altered example from around 1600. In many other cases they were redecorated and given more specialised functions as drawing rooms or ballrooms or libraries.\n"}
{"id": "1851469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851469", "title": "Excelsior Diamond", "text": "Excelsior Diamond\n\nThe Excelsior Diamond is a gem-quality diamond, and was the largest known diamond in the world from the time of its discovery in 1893 until 1905, when the larger Cullinan Diamond was found. It was found on June 30, 1893 at the Jagersfontein Mine in South Africa, south east of Kimberley whose fame as a diamond mining center always overshadowed that of Jagersfontein. It had a blue-white tint and weighed 971 old carats or 995.2 metric carats (or 194 g). The Excelsior rates as the third largest rough diamond of gem quality ever found. It was ultimately cut into ten stones weighing from 13 to 68 carats. (2.6 to 13.6 g).\n\nThe Excelsior Diamond was found on June 30, 1893 at the Jagersfontein Mine in the Orange Free State, one of the South African Republics during the second half of the 19th century, by a worker in a shovelful of gravel he was loading into a truck. Instead of handing it over to his overseer, he delivered it directly to the mine manager, who rewarded him with £500 in cash and a horse equipped with a saddle and bridle. On the day of the diamond's discovery the contract between the mining company and the syndicate of firms in London which purchased its diamonds expired. This may have contributed to the fact that its discovery was not reported in any of the prestigious British newspapers, and the diamond, despite its fine quality and exceptional size, remained largely unremarked upon. It was shipped to the London offices of Messrs Wernher, Beit and Company, one of the members of the diamond buying syndicate, with the mining company retaining a 50 percent share in the ownership of the diamond. Wernher, Beit attempted to insure the diamond for £40,000, but eventually settled for £16,250.\n\nIn 1895 the Excelsior was joined by another very large diamond from the Jagersfontein Mine, first called the Reitz Diamond after the President of the Orange Free State, but soon renamed the Jubilee Diamond, in honor of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. For reasons that remain obscure, this smaller diamond weighing only 650.80 carats overshadowed the Excelsior; one reason speculated is that the Excelsior was perceived to be far too large, and of quality too superior, for any prospective buyer. The consequence was that it was sent to I. J. Asscher in Amsterdam, in 1903, to be cut into ten smaller stones.\n\nThe rough stone measured 971 carats in weight and was categorized as Color G. The stone was shaped like a half a loaf of bread; it was unique and inspired the name Excelsior, which means \"higher\". It measured by 2 inches by 1 inch thick. The Excelsior was colored a stunning white with a tint of blue. It did contain a number of black carbon inclusions, which are typical of the diamonds from the Jagersfontein mine. The crystalline structure resembled a fractured icicle. From the time of its discovery on June 30, 1893, it was the largest diamond known to exist, until the discovery of the Cullinan Diamond in 1905.\n\nFinally, after the diamond sat in the vault waiting for a buyer for many years, the owners made the decision to cut the stone into several smaller stones. This decision meant that the Excelsior would never be a single large spectacular faceted stone. At the time, the manager of the De Beers diamond syndicate said that the dividing of the stone into many small pieces was \"the greatest tragedy of modern times in the history of famous diamonds\". In retrospect, diamond experts feel that it should have been cut to yield a single large diamond. Why it was not, remains a mystery. By contrast, the owners of the Cullinan Diamond cut that stone in such a way that the largest faceted diamond in the world came from it. The fate of the Excelsior kept it out of the Smithsonian or other historical museums. It was cut without regard to its historical significance, divided into small, easily sold assorted stones. The named pieces were:\n\nThere were a further 11 smaller pieces, some only a fraction of a carat in weight. It was many years before all of the separate stones were sold.\n\nThe cut stones were parceled out and sold to several different buyers. The Excelsior I, which came up for sale in 1991 and 1996, was purchased by Robert Mouawad for $2,642,000. The remaining stones were used in various grand jewelry pieces such as extravagant tiaras and fabulous bracelets and other fine jewelry creations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1851509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851509", "title": "Mark Schwarzer", "text": "Mark Schwarzer\n\nMark Schwarzer (; born 6 October 1972) is an Australian former professional association footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He represented Australia at international level from 1993 to 2013, and was selected for both the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups.\n\nHaving progressed through the youth ranks of Colo Cougars, Penrith, Blacktown Association and Marconi Stallions, Schwarzer turned professional for National Soccer League side Marconi Stallions in 1990. After making 58 appearances for the club, he moved to German Bundesliga side Dynamo Dresden in 1994, appearing twice, and then to Bundesliga side 1. FC Kaiserslautern in 1995, appearing four times. Schwarzer joined then-second-tier side Bradford City in 1996 and made 16 appearances before joining Premier League club Middlesbrough in February 1997. He made 445 appearances for Middlesbrough, but decided to leave the club in May 2008. He then switched to Premier League side Fulham, and made 218 appearances for the club until he moved to Chelsea in 2013. He was the first – and, to date, only – non-Brit to have made more than 500 Premier League appearances (making him the highest-appearing non-Brit in the Premier League's history), and also the oldest player to have played in the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League. He joined Leicester City on a free transfer in January 2015 and left the club at the end of their 2015–16 Premier League-winning season.\n\nHaving played for Australia at under-17 and under-20 level, Schwarzer made his full international debut in a World Cup qualifying match against Canada in 1993 as a substitute after Robert Zabica was sent off in the 17th minute. During the course of his international career, he won a total of 109 caps for his country. He became Australia's most capped player when he surpassed Alex Tobin's appearance record in January 2011.\n\nSchwarzer was born in North Richmond, a semi-rural suburb in north-western Sydney, and attended Richmond North Public School and Colo High School. He played for the local soccer club the Colo Cougars. His parents, Hans-Joachim and Doris, emigrated to Australia from Germany in 1968. He speaks fluent German.\n\nIn 2009, Schwarzer was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia.\n\nSchwarzer's first club was Colo Cougars in Richmond, New South Wales. He started his professional career at age 19 with Marconi Stallions in the National Soccer League. He left the Sydney-based club to play in Germany in 1994 with Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Kaiserslautern. He then travelled to England to play for Bradford City in 1996, where he eventually joined Middlesbrough in February 1997.\n\nSchwarzer made his debut for Middlesbrough against Stockport County in the League Cup semi-finals on 26 February 1997. He featured in the final against Leicester City, which ended as a 1–1 draw, but was injured for the replay. He also played in the 1998 League Cup final against Chelsea, but was unable to prevent Middlesbrough from slipping to a 2–0 defeat. He was part of the side, however, who beat Bolton Wanderers 2–1 to win the final six years later, despite making an error described by BBC Sport as a \"howler\" which allowed Kevin Davies a consolation goal for Bolton.\n\nIn the last match of the 2004–05 season against Manchester City, he saved a Robbie Fowler penalty in stoppage time to preserve a 1–1 draw. The draw was sufficient to put Middlesbrough in seventh in the final league table and ensure qualification for the UEFA Cup; had Fowler converted the penalty, Manchester City would have qualified for the UEFA Cup at Middlesbrough's expense.\n\nSchwarzer was granted a transfer request by Middlesbrough on 6 January 2006 and sought to join a new club, but he withdrew his request on 20 January 2006, and rejoined the team. A fractured cheekbone sustained against West Ham United, however, looked like it had ruled Schwarzer out for the rest of the season, but he returned for the UEFA Cup final against Sevilla, albeit playing with a protective mask. When he played in Middlesbrough's 1–0 victory over Portsmouth on 29 December 2007, he became the Premier League's longest-serving foreigner at one club, surpassing Dennis Bergkamp's record of 315 matches. Schwarzer's final Middlesbrough appearance came in an 8–1 victory over Manchester City on the final day of the 2007–08 Premier League season, after he had made 446 appearances in all competitions.\n\nSchwarzer's contract with Middlesbrough expired in June 2008, and although he was offered a new contract, manager Gareth Southgate had to plan a future with a new goalkeeper as, on 21 May 2008, Schwarzer signed a two-year contract at Fulham, ending an 11-year association with the Teesside club. Schwarzer revealed in an interview with \"The World Game\" that he had received offers from Bayern Munich and Juventus but declined their offers because they could not guarantee him the position as the number-one goalkeeper.\n\nSchwarzer made his Fulham debut in a 2–1 defeat to newly promoted Premier League side Hull City, but he followed up by keeping a clean sheet in his next match in a 1–0 win at home to Arsenal and played every minute of the 2008–09 season. He kept ten clean sheets during the 2008–09 season in all competitions.\nSchwarzer's contribution was important as his performances lead Fulham to a seventh-place finish and a place in Europe for the next season, after the club had only just avoided relegation during the 2007–08 season. He received the Fulham Player of the Year 2008–09 in his first year at the club. He was also named the Premier League's Player of the Month for February 2010, in which he only conceded one goal in his team's two wins and two draws that month, making him the first Australian to do so.\n\nHe played an important role in Fulham reaching the Europa League final in 2010, but Schwarzer lost his second European final with a narrow defeat to Atlético Madrid.\n\nFollowing his performances during the 2009–10 season, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger attempted to sign Schwarzer. It was reported that a bid of around £2 million in May 2010 had been made for Schwarzer and a second bid of around the same value had been made in August 2010; however both were rejected by Fulham.\n\nOn 13 August 2010, Fulham manager Mark Hughes revealed that Schwarzer had handed in a transfer request, which Hughes had rejected. On 31 August 2010, it was reported that Arsenal had made a last-ditch bid of around £4 million to bring Schwarzer to the Emirates Stadium before the transfer window closed, however Hughes denied that any approach was made.\n\nSchwarzer signed a contract extension with Fulham on 18 January 2012, committing himself to the club until at least the summer of 2013.\n\nSchwarzer made a notable injury-time penalty save against Mikel Arteta in January 2013 to help Fulham earn a 3–3 draw against Arsenal. In April 2013, he made his 500th Premier League appearance in a game against Arsenal, and became the first non-British or Irish player to do so in the process.\n\nOn 5 June 2013, Schwarzer announced he was leaving Fulham following the arrival of Maarten Stekelenburg. He said, \"I've been hearing that for a while,\" he said of Stekelenburg's arrival. \"It's no great surprise and I'll be looking for another club.\" Schwarzer was one of 12 players released by Fulham at the end of the 2012–13 Premier League season.\n\nOn 9 July 2013, Schwarzer signed a one-year contract with Fulham's West London rivals Chelsea on a free transfer. He has been quoted saying, \"It's one of the biggest and best clubs in the world, and it's an honour to sign for Chelsea. I didn't take much convincing to come here.\" He made his competitive debut in a 2–0 away victory over Swindon Town in the League Cup. In Schwarzer's second appearance with Chelsea, he kept another clean sheet, as Chelsea eliminated Arsenal from the League Cup in a 2–0 victory on 29 October.\n\nOn 11 December, Schwarzer became the oldest player to debut in the UEFA Champions League aged 41 years and 65 days, when he kept his third clean sheet in three appearances for Chelsea, in a 1–0 home victory over Steaua București, a result that confirmed Chelsea's progression to the knockout round as first in their group.\n\nSchwarzer became the oldest player to represent Chelsea in the Premier League when he played against Sunderland on 19 April 2014, aged 41 years and 195 days old. He became the club's oldest ever player by some margin, overtaking Graham Rix, whom last played for Chelsea at the age of 37 years and 203 days. On 22 April, he replaced the injured Petr Čech in the first half of a Champions League semi-final against Atlético Madrid, and kept the score at 0–0. On 27 April, he started against Liverpool at Anfield, a crucial game for Chelsea to stay in the title race. He kept a clean sheet and made some outstanding saves to deny Liverpool from equalising, with Chelsea winning the game 2–0. His clean sheet against Liverpool was his 150th Premier League clean sheet, a feat only two other goalkeepers have achieved so far, those goalkeepers being Čech and David James.\n\nSchwarzer was included on the list of players released by Chelsea at the end of the season, but he eventually signed a new one-year contract with the club, on 30 June 2014.\n\nAlthough Schwarzer did not make a single league appearances before his move to Leicester City, Chelsea manager José Mourinho stated that he would receive a replica winner's medal for his contributions that season and was welcomed back for a celebration dinner at the end of the season.\n\nOn 6 January 2015, Schwarzer moved to Premier League side Leicester City on a free transfer as cover for the injured Kasper Schmeichel, after signing an 18-month deal. Chelsea manager José Mourinho praised Schwarzer's contribution to his former club, and stated that Chelsea would miss him. Schwarzer made his competitive debut for Leicester on 24 January in a 2–1 away win over Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round of the season's FA Cup, becoming Leicester's oldest ever player in doing so. He made his Premier League debut for Leicester one week later in a 3–1 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Schwarzer made eight appearances in his first season at the King Power Stadium, of which six were in their successful campaign to avoid relegation from the Premier League.\n\nSchwarzer made no league appearances in the 2015–16 Premier League season, when Leicester became champions, making him ineligible for a winner's medal (minimum five league games required). In spite of this, he still became the first player since Eric Cantona to be in the championship winning squad at different clubs in successive seasons.\n\nSchwarzer was released from Leicester after the end of 2015–16 season.\n\nSchwarzer made his international debut for Australia against Canada in Edmonton in a 1994 World Cup qualifier in 1993. He came on as a substitute for Milan Blagojevic after first-choice Robert Zabica was sent off 15 minutes into the match. In the return leg in Sydney, he made headlines when he saved two penalties to send Australia to the final phase of qualifying against Argentina. Schwarzer did not play in these matches, and Australia were defeated 2–1 on aggregate.\n\nHe was instrumental in Australia's qualification for the 2006 World Cup, in the play-off against Uruguay. After Uruguay won the first leg 1–0 in Montevideo, Australia won 1–0 in Sydney on 16 November 2005. In the penalty shoot-out, Schwarzer saved two penalties to see Australia victorious 4–2.\n\nAt the World Cup finals, he played the first two games in Australia's group matches, conceding a controversial goal against Japan, and two goals against Brazil. In the third match, he was replaced by Zeljko Kalac, but after Kalac's disappointing performance, he was reinstated for the round of 16 match against Italy. Although he correctly predicted the direction of the penalty kick, he was unable to save the penalty in that match, which was scored by Francesco Totti in injury time and sent Australia out of the World Cup.\n\nSchwarzer played in all of Australia's matches in the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. Although he made two good saves in the opening match against Oman, which finished as a 1–1 draw, he made an error which led to a goal in the 3–1 loss to Iraq. In the quarter-final, he could not match Japanese goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi during the penalty shootout, which saw the Socceroos get knocked out of the competition in their debut at the tournament. Schwarzer said that the penalty shootout in the Asian Cup quarter-finals was the first penalty shoot-out in his career that he had ever lost.\n\nSchwarzer saved an 89th-minute Shao Jiayi penalty against China in Australia's 0–0 draw in the 2010 World Cup qualifier in March 2008, continuing his record of stopping penalty kicks. He received his second yellow card of the campaign against Qatar in Doha, in which Australia were 3–1 winners, leading to him being suspended for the following match against China.\n\nSchwarzer made several vital saves to secure Australia's Asian Cup Qualifier 2–1 comeback win over Oman in Muscat after conceding from his penalty save rebound.\n\nHe was the country's first-choice keeper for all three matches of the group stage in the 2010 World Cup in a group composed of Australia, Germany, Ghana and Serbia. In the first match, Australia were crushed 4–0 by the Germans, but they recovered with a 1–1 draw against Ghana in the next game. In the final match, Australia beat Serbia 2–1, thus finishing third in the group with four points, just missing out on qualification to the round of 16 on goal difference with Ghana.\n\nAfter the tournament, Schwarzer declared his interest in playing at the 2014 World Cup, at which time he would be 41 years old. On 5 November 2013, however, he announced his retirement from international level.\n\nStatistics reference:\n\nInternational statistics ref:\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nAustralia\n\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nChelsea\n\nLeicester City\n\nAustralia\n\n"}

It first aired on Comedy Central on March 19, 2003.\n\nIn the episode, an alien satellite dish is placed in Cartman's butt. Shortly after, the boys are abducted by the aliens that installed it. They find out that the planet Earth is simply an intergalactic reality show. When word gets back to their home planet, the aliens decide to cancel the show, and something must be done if the boys want to save the day.\n\nThe episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker and is rated TV-MA L in the United States, except on syndicated broadcasts, where it is rated TV-14, instead. It was originally intended to air as the 100th episode, but \"I'm a Little Bit Country\" aired as the 100th episode instead.\n\nThis episode begins almost identically to the very first \"South Park\" episode, \"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\", with Cartman arriving and talking about a dream where he was abducted by aliens. There are some minor differences from the previous episode such as Cartman calling Ike a \"semen-puking asshole dickhead\" after Kyle tells him not to call his brother a \"dildo\" and Ike saying more profane statements like \"Suck my balls\" and \"Don't kick the goddamn baby!\". When the children realize that all this has happened before, they come to the conclusion that they are stuck in a \"repeat,\" they and Chef decide to do something about the anal probe Cartman has; they first see a proctologist, then a scientist. Cartman then refuses to activate the satellite unless Kyle is the one who sticks his finger into his ass. Cartman torments Kyle seven times by continually farting, and finally Kyle gets fed up and plugs him. The scientist, Jeff Goldblum, discovers that he can reverse the polarity of the message that the alien ship is transmitting. A group of Visitors then show up, and the children and Chef flee. However, the children are ultimately abducted.\n\nThe kids wake up on the ship, and meet Najix, an alien who looks like Stan's dad, and explains that he chose an appearance that would be most pleasing to them. They hate this as it is too reminiscent of the movie \"Contact\", which they hated. He shows his true form, a grotesque, terrifying monster, with yellow and green skin, four legs, and sharp teeth, So the children have him go through a series of transformations, mostly of celebrities or famous television characters, until Cartman suggests \"a taco that craps ice cream\". Najix then explains he and the other aliens make a reality show called \"Earth\", and all of Earth's species, such as Asians, bears, ducks, Jews, deer and Hispanics, are taken from their respective home planets for the purposes of the show, and everyone around the world is unknowingly being filmed and watched.\n\nThe scientist discovers this at the same time on Earth by translating the binary code that resulted from reversing the polarity of the message he proceeds to tell everyone, which leads the alien network heads to cancel the show and prepare to destroy the Earth. The scientist concludes that the show is cancelled thanks to associating the term \"chaos theory\" up to \"cancelled\", then uses his word association skills with the word \"jackets\" to come up with a plan to send the ship a computer virus to disable their computers. Chef responds \"That doesn't make any goddamned sense!\". When word spreads to the rest of the planet that Earth is one big reality show, humans become elated that they're famous.\n\nIn outer space, Najix is informed that \"Earth\" is being cancelled, because humans' knowledge that they are a reality television show has ruined the program's quality. When the boys are informed that Earth will be destroyed in order to make way for something more useful, they go to the planet Fognl to meet the alien producers, the \"Joozians\", Jewish caricatures with large noses and stereotypical accents, described as controlling all media in the universe. The aliens are unmoved by the boy's pleas to save Earth, explaining that after 100 episodes, the show should be cancelled because shows tend to lose quality after 100 episodes. The Joozians then go to a strip bar, and inhale a purple powder in a manner similar to cocaine. They later get a hotel room with a hooker, and engage in acts that Kenny photographs. When the Joozians later sober up and express shame and embarrassment at their prior acts, the boys agree not to publicize their photo of the Joozians' sexual interlude if the Joozians agree to refrain from destroying Earth.

It is the seat of the canton that bears its name. The westernmost city on mainland Ecuador, Salinas is an important tourist center. Salinas, Ecuador's largest coastal resort, offers one of the country's best real estate investment markets and most popular and most upscale beach lifestyle. It was the site of the ISA World Junior Surfing Games Ecuador in 2009. There are two major yacht clubs in Salinas, the first is Salinas Yacht Club, which is smaller than the Puerto Lucia Yacht Club, in Santa Elena, in an area known as 'La Libertad' which, in Spanish means 'The Freedom Town'. Puerto Lucia boasts a hotel, several restaurants, a private beach and apartment buildings, as well as the large marina and port.\n\nIt was a small fishing village until June 30, 1929, when it was established as the rural parish of Santa Elena. On December 22, 1937, an official decree was signed by the Commander in Chief, General Alberto Enriquez Gallo and published in Official Gazette No. 52 of December 27 of that year, that elevated the parish to the rank of canton. Its cantonal head is the town of Salinas, and is composed of the rural parishes Ancon, and Jose Luis Tamayo Anconcito (Muey).\n\nSalinas is divided into four urban parishes. They are:\n\n\nThe museum is located in Salinas Guayas, Malecon and Quil streets and is known as \"The Museum of the Great Peninsula\". It has an archaeological room, a temporary exhibition hall, a lounge, and a naval parade.\n\nThe Archaeological room has a complete sample of the cultures that settled in this large peninsula, composed of the Valdivia and Machalilla Engoroy (CV) cultures of the Formative period (4200 BC - 500 BC), as well as the Jambelí Guangala Regional Development period (500 BC - 500) and maintenance-Integration Guancavilca period (500-1530), which include human and animal figurines, ceremonial and utilitarian vessels, bottles, whistle, stone axes, beads necklaces Spondylus, horns and whistles and a variety of both cylindrical and flat seals.\n\nOn displays is a model of a raft - Guancavilca Manteña - reproduced according to the description of Samano 1526. The Guancavilcas large rafts were in their black-colored vessels, hands and stone metate for grinding grains, spherical stone weights for nets and pointed to the divers who were also used to hit and release Spondylus shells attached to rocks; copper objects such as axes and hatchets handle coins and Spondylus shell accounts, circular and rectangular shapes that were marketed along with the copper material, in Mexico and Peru, are evidence of the last thousand years of navigation our country.\nA model that reproduces the galleon Jesus Maria de la Limpia Concepcion known as \"The Captain\" takes us back to colonial times and the exhibit showcases the salvage in that galleon wrecked in 1654 off the coast of Chanduy.\n\nCoins of 1, 2, 4 and 8 reales (cobs or crushed calls)? were made in silver and transported on ships to Panama and from there to the Caribbean to be transported to Europe, fragments of silver cutlery and plates and pottery is known as majolica bars, tin, silver, cannonballs both bronze, and iron and lead for muskets.\n\nA gold cross with Latin inscriptions, an earring with pearl bases, burner and silver candelabra, a buckle, metal earrings agate and correspond to the material used for personal use by the passengers on this ship that ran aground off the coast of the town of El Real.\n\nPeople travel from all over the world because the Surfing in Ecuador offers an ideal climate all year round. Punta Carnero is a beach located approximately ten minutes south of Salinas. Its name, “Ram Point” in English, stems from the rocky headland located at the southeast end of the beach. Punta Carnero Beach has been chosen many times to be the venue of not just national surf competitions, but also at an international level.\n\nThe beach extends for approximately and is relatively wide, with white to gray sand, medium waves and a prevalent inland breeze.\n\nMany who travel to Punta Carnero also visit other famous beaches which are found just off the coast of Ecuador by is known the world over, the Galápagos Islands an area of volcanic islands distributed around the equator in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nOther attractions of popular activities include:\n\n\nSalinas has a warm and dry desert climate with abundant sunshine all year around. Although the city is located in a tropical zone near the Equator, the weather closely resembles a subtropical climate, being comfortable and dry rather than hot, humid, and rainy. This is due to the Humboldt Current, which lower temperatures to a moderate climate for most of the year, except in the summer months, when the temperature rises.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1851548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851548", "title": "Lake Murray (Oklahoma)", "text": "Lake Murray (Oklahoma)\n\nLake Murray is a lake in south central Oklahoma, near Ardmore named for Oklahoma Governor William H. Murray. It was created by damming Anadarche and Fourche Maline Creeks. The lake is wholly within Lake Murray State Park, Oklahoma's largest state park, containing over 12,500 acres (51 km²) of relative wilderness. A state-operated lodge and resort is located on the west shore that serves many visitors to the lake, and serves as a base for numerous cabin and campground facilities near the lake.\n\nOn October 12, 2001, Lake Murray State Park became the first Oklahoma state park listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nAccording to \"Ada Evening News\", the concept of creating a lake at this location surfaced in 1929, when George C. Gibbons, the secretary of the Ada Chamber of Commerce, inspected the area. He contacted the U. S. Biological Survey, which assigned an engineer and a biologist to perform a preliminary study for creating a wildlife refuge that included a lake for waterfowl habitat. Senator Elmer Thomas also became interested in the proposal. Thomas worked to get congressional approval of $250,000 for the project. However, the Biological Survey failed to complete its report before Congress adjourned.\n\nMeanwhile, William H. \"Alfalfa Bill\" Murray, who became Governor of Oklahoma in 1931, embraced the proposal. The Great Depression was in full swing and had hit the state hard. Murray realized that such a project could put a lot of people back to work, not only to construct the facility but to operate it afterwards. He pushed the Oklahoma legislature into appropriating $90,000 for land purchases in 1933. The amount was later increased to $150,000. He also approved starting condemnation proceedings to obtain the land and allowing relief funds to pay workers for clearing the heavily forested proposed lake site\n\nThe state legislature appropriated $90,000 on April 10. 1933, to purchase about in Carter and Love Counties for a state park. The park and the man-made lake it contained would be named Lake Murray, for William H. \"Alfalfa Bill\" Murray, who was Oklahoma governor from 1931 until 1936. During the following year, the National Park Service (NPS) acquired adjacent to Lake Murray State Park. The land purchased was designated as a Recreational Demonstration Area (RDA).\n\nThe Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), established two camps to support the Lake Murray project. The park was designed by E. J. Johnson, who would later serve as park superintendent from 1935 to 1940. The design of structures and facilities employed the same National Park Service rustic style that had been used previously at Yellowstone, Grand Canyon and Yosemite National Parks.\n\nLake Murray State Park Lodge became the first of seven state-owned resort lodges in 1951.\n\nIn 2013, the state governor authorized the Department of Tourism to spend up to $15 million to construct a new lodge at Lake Murray State Park. After a number of changes, upgrades and cost overruns, the new lodge was completed in 2017 at a cost of over $30 million.\n\nLake Murray State Park is Oklahoma's oldest and largest state park. The state legislature bought the property for the park for about $90,000 on April 10, 1933.\n\nWorkers in two Emergency Works Act programs established during the height of the Depression by then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), converged on what had formerly been Chickasaw Nation property in 1933, to begin construction on Lake Murray State Park. It was the first state park built in Oklahoma and is still the largest. At the same time, workers began construction on the castle-looking building later to be called Tucker Tower. During construction, almost 17,000 men worked on the park project for $1.25 a day in wages.\n\nThe lake was completed in 1937 and opened to the public in 1938. But work on the tower ceased in 1935, reportedly because federal officials decided the project was taking too long to complete and costing too much. And so without windows, doors, floors, or ceilings, the tower was left open to the public and elements. It had been built based on photographs of a European castle taken during World War I by veteran Sen. Fred Tucker, a local legislator for whom the tower is named.\n\nFishing, boating and all water sports are allowed at Lake Murray. Lake Murray Lodge offers guest rooms and suites, cabins, meeting space, The Apple Bin restaurant, and the Parlor. Other activities include boating, swimming, fishing, golfing, picnics, camping, horseback riding, hayrides, hiking, biking, rollerblading, miniature golf and paddle boating. Sports facilities include an 18-hole golf course with a pro shop, tennis courts, softball fields, baseball diamond, horseshoe pits, badminton and volleyball nets.\n\nLake Murray State Park offers an ATV area for 3/4 wheelers, motorcycles and dirt bikes. Other facilities found in the park include an airstrip, Boat Mechanic, marina with rentals, swimming pool with a changing house, swimming beach, riding stable, remote control air field for hobbyists, miniature golf course and Frisbee golf. Nine RV campgrounds with over 300 RV sites and unlimited tent sites are located throughout Lake Murray State Park with full hookups, restrooms and showers.\n\nLake Murray State Park was the first Oklahoma state park listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 2011, National Public Radio reported that Lake Murray State Park was Oklahoma's most popular state park, attracting over 1.7 million visitors, and that it earned the most money from activity fees. Including Lake Murray lodge, the park generated nearly $3.2 million for the year.\n\nLake Murray is a man-made reservoir, created by building an earthen dam across the Anadarche and Fourche Maline Creeks. It was intended primarily for recreational use. The lake has a surface area of , a shoreline of and a capacity of 153,250 acre-feet. The dam was completed in 1937.\n\nThe original plans for the dam were developed by engineers from Oklahoma Agricultural & Mechanical College, now named Oklahoma State University (OSU). The WPA began constructing the dam in 1935. The structure was completed and turned over to the state on March 5, 1938.\n\nThe dam has a concrete core covered with earth and rock.\n\nTucker Tower was originally intended as a summer residence for then-Gov. William H. \"Alfalfa Bill\" Murray, in return for his efforts to get the lake and state park situated in Southern Oklahoma. The design was based on photographs of a European castle that were taken by Fred Tucker, a veteran of World War I and an Oklahoma state senator, and for whom the structure is named. It is constructed of limestone that was quarried at the park site. The tower is five stories high with an observation deck on top. There is a two-story section that was intended as a living area. The interior was left unfinished when time and money ran out in 1935. No governor has ever spent a night there. Years later flooring and a spiral staircase were added to the tower section and the whole complex was turned into a museum.\n\nThe tower remained unfinished until the state park service stepped in and completed the construction. From the first-floor patio, the tower reaches 65 feet into the air, allowing a breath-taking view that encompasses miles in all directions. The patio itself is about 60 feet above lake level. The tower features one roofed and two open patios, a tree- and flower-lined walkway from the parking lot, a lake lookout along the path, and shaded benches from which to watch the birds and wildlife. During the summer, a variety of programs are presented at 1 and 4 p.m. daily.\n\nTucker Tower opened to the public in 1954 as a geological museum, featuring the granular hexahedrite meteorite found on the state park property in the 1930s. The meteorite remains on display in the tower, although the focus of the facility was changed to that of a nature center in 1981. The Lake Murray Meteorite, the largest of its kind ever found and the fifth largest in the world, was cut in half at the Institute of Meteorites in New Mexico, allowing a rare glimpse into the inside of the 90-million-year-old object. It is just one of the many exhibits at Tucker Tower Nature Center. Other displays include the reconstructed skull and fossilized bones of a mastodon found along the Washita River about 35 miles away; a mind-boggling animal skull collection, and educational exhibits of fossils, Lake Murray history, insects, fish and wildlife, legends, and rock specimens.\n\nTucker Tower was closed for a major renovation and reopened in 2013. The renovation, which included a addition, cost about $3 million, was paid for by the park's oil and gas trust fund and public donations. The nature center has a classroom and exhibits of local geology, wildlife, and native inhabitants.\n\nLMPC became the first state park in Oklahoma to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). It was added to the list on October 12, 2001, with registration number NR 01001097. The application for registration stated that:\nLake Murray State Park is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places under Criteria A and C for its close association with a number of New Deal programs, as the largest, most intact Recreational Demonstration Area in Oklahoma, and as a designed landscape that reflects the National Park Service design philosophy for state and national parks. The park has had an enormous economic impact in the area, both historically and presently. It retains a high degree of integrity and accurately reflects the period of its planning and construction..\nThe applicable NRHP criteria are defined as follows:\nCriterion A: \"Property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history.\"\nCriterion C: \"Property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or represents the work of a master, or possesses high artistic values, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components lack individual distinction.\n\nThe application for NRHP listing identified 195 contributing resources for the district. The sheer size of the list precludes listing them all in this article, but they can be found on the original application. All of the significant resources within the proposed district boundaries were labeled as either \"Contributing\" or \"non-contributing\". Resources in the former category had to meet certain criteria:\nNon-contributing resources were usually those built less than 50 years before date of the listing on the NRHP.\n\nThe application also characterized the resources as follows:\nThe lake can be reached via Interstate 35, Exit 24, then east on State Highway 77S. SH-77S completely encircles the lake and provides excellent access to all parts of the lake.\n\n\n"}

Although the scheme had considerable support from some locals, it met with opposition from many other groups, and Meridian Energy decided in March 2004 not to go ahead with the project.\n\nThe plan was to divert river water at the rate of up to 280 cubic metres per second into a separate canal for six power stations. This was on top of the three dams already in the upper Waitaki. The scheme would have produced approximately 520MW of power — enough to supply a city the size of Christchurch.\n\nThe objections to the scheme included land issues, the disruption during construction, and concerns about the sustainability of the river. Meridian was working on a large scale mitigation process, whereby issues could be identified and mitigated, when the scheme was finally canceled.\n\nOn 29 March 2004, Meridian announced that they would not continue with Project Aqua. Among their reasons were the uncertainty in gaining access to the water, that Aqua could not come on line soon enough to meet New Zealand's growing electricity demand, the amount of money it was costing the company, design changes due to geology reports, and the Resource Management Act making it difficult to get consent for large water based projects.\n\nMeridian's 2004 annual report states that they lost NZ$38.7 million on the project. At the time of cancellation they had spent considerably more than this, but much of the expenditure was for assets such as land that they would later sell.\n\nSubsequently, Meridian proceeded to develop an alternative hydroelectric scheme along the same stretch of the Waitaki River - the North Bank tunnel project. They received water uses consents from Environment Canterbury in December 2008 but work on the project was suspended in January 2013.\n\n"}

It has a highly convoluted shoreline more than 2000 km long.\nThe lake has been a source of nourishment for many of the local peoples. Freshwater sawfish have been caught in its shallow waters to feed the crocodiles in a farming operation.\n\nIndigenous tribes of around 5000 people own the lake and the surrounding one million hectares of forest.\n\nAlso, a cryptid known as \"Murray\" purportedly lives, or used to live, in the lake. This creature was described as resembling a theropod dinosaur such as Tyrannosaurus. Along with the \"Murray\", Lake Murray is known for a large population of peacock bass that were introduced by Indian merchants.\nIn 2003, logging company Concord Pacific was forced out of the area by Greenpeace and other NGO's. 100,000 hectares of ancient forest was degraded by the logging along the Kiunga-Aiambak road.\n\nLake Murray was the site of a Greenpeace Australia Pacific Global Forest Rescue Station. Forty volunteers from 25 countries worked with the local Kuni, Begwa and Pari tribes to identify and mark land ownership.

Eric Hamber is a comprehensive secondary school with approximately 1250 students. Each year, approximately 70% of the senior class graduates with honours standing. The school is named after Eric Hamber, former Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia. The school colours, maroon and light blue, were the colours used by Eric Hamber's race horses. The school's mascot is a Griffin.\n\nThe elementary schools in Eric Hamber's catchment area include:\n\nFor Grades 8 to 12, Hamber offers two options for students: the Challenge Program for acceleration and enrichment and the Studio Program (formerly Academy) for innovative thinking.\n\nThe Challenge Program, available in English, Social Studies, Science and/or Math, presents highly-able students with a challenging Grade 8 to 12 program that encompasses both acceleration and enrichment. Students in the program are voracious learners who will complete three years of study in Grades 8 and 9, often moving above and beyond the traditional curriculum. Learners in Grades 10 to 12 will continue to expand their learning through enriched and advanced placement courses as well as through guided independent or concurrent post-secondary studies. This program will appeal to students of high ability who are extremely motivated to learn and respond well to a rapid pace of instruction.\n\nThe Studio, short for the Latin \"Studium Libertatis\", is a place where students who crave opportunities for empowerment, autonomy, flexibility and choice are given the liberty to engage in their zeal for learning. Teachers function as mentors to learning as students explore and develop skills in creativity and critical thinking and prepare themselves for success in a rapidly evolving global environment. Students in this program are accepted into accelerated English and Social Studies courses as well as several elective courses exclusive to accepted students. The program is aimed at students with a desire to shape the curriculum to suit their interests and to accommodate their learning styles.\n\nEric Hamber offers a Mandarin Accelerated program for Grade 8 and 9 students who have completed the Mandarin Bilingual program at Jamieson Elementary School.\n\nEric Hamber has the largest high school fashion design program in western Canada. The program was started in 1992 by Nina Ho. Many graduates from Eric Hamber Secondary's fashion design program complete post secondary fashion programs in Canada, the United States, Europe and Asia and work in the fashion design field locally and abroad with companies such as Lululemon, Aritzia and Mac and Jac. Eric Hamber students have a strong history of winning awards locally, provincially, and nationally at the Skills Canada Competition. An annual show is presented every year to showcase the students' work.\n\nEric Hamber has a dragon boat team that has won numerous local and national dragon boat competitions, regularly representing Canada at the World Dragon Boat Championships.\n\nThe Eric Hamber Theatre department runs four mainstage and four junior theatre productions (the \"Footlights\") each school year. The mainstage productions usually include a guest-directed play, musical and student-written play.\n\nOn May 27, 2011, Eric Hamber held an event called \"Run for the Sun\" to raise money to install four solar panels on the school's roof. The solar panels are being used to heat the water in the school year round. A total of 653 students from 26 classes participated in the event by running or walking five kilometres. The event raised a total of $8,495.00 and a successful acceptance of a Vancouver Foundation Generation Green award of $12,500 raised a total of $21,000.\n\nClubs are a staple of the Hamber community. Each year a clubs day exhibition is hosted, encouraging students to get involved.

In the 2010 season, the Eric Hamber Griffins competed in the Junior Varsity AA league only. In the 2011 season, the Griffins competed with teams in both the Junior Varsity AA and Varsity Tier II leagues. In 2012, both the Junior Varsity and Varsity teams competed in the AA league. That year, the Junior Varsity team made the playoffs, becoming the first Griffins Football team to do so, losing in the first round. In 2013, the Griffins Junior Varsity team competed in an amalgamated AA/AAA league while the Varsity team was relegated at the school's request to the Tier II development league. The Junior Varsity team failed to make the playoffs while the Varsity team was defeated in the first round of the Tier II championship.\n\nBeginning in 2014, Eric Hamber stopped fielding both a Junior Varsity and Varsity team, opting to join the teams and compete with a roster consisting of Grade 9 to 12 players in the Tier II development League. In the 2014 season, the Griffins made it to the final of the Tier II Provincial Championship. In 2015, the Griffins continued to field only one team, with that team losing in the semi-finals of the provincial tournament. \n\nStarting in 2012, Eric Hamber began a Grade 8 football program in the spring. The team does not play in the formal Grade 8 fall league but organizing exhibition games with other schools during the spring sports season. The program also organizes a flag football program in the spring for feeder elementary schools to promote a culture of football amongst students who are likely to eventually attend to Eric Hamber. \n\nEric Hamber Griffins Football runs with relative independence from the athletics department of the school due to its unique province-wide league and player-based funding. Player fees range from $250-300 based on the season and funding is available for those who can't afford the costs.\n\nEric Hamber has a history in television and film; one of the parking lots was extensively used in the early days of television series \"21 Jump Street\", including a memorable confrontation involving Johnny Depp. It was later used as the high school in the 2007 film \"Juno\". Eric Hamber was used for the filming of TV series iZombie in November 2015.\n\nIn 2011, several of Eric Hamber's staff were part of a glee club called \"The Edutones\" on the show \"Canada Sings\". They defeated the opposing The Distillery Restaurants Corporation's \"Run DRC\" glee club and won $10,000 for the BC Children's Hospital Foundation. They appeared on episode 6 of season 1 which aired on September 8, 2011.\n\n\n"}

The CSA developed from a Baptist congregation called the Zarephath-Horeb Community Church, founded in 1971 in the small community of Pontiac in southern Missouri. Over time, Zarephath-Horeb evolved into an extremist paramilitary organization and was rechristened CSA. The group operated a large compound in northern Arkansas called \"the Farm\". In April 1985, law enforcement officers investigating the group for weapons violations and terrorist acts carried out a siege against the compound. After a peaceful resolution, officers arrested and later convicted CSA's top leaders, and the organization dissolved.\n\nThe founder of the CSA was James Ellison, who was jailed in federal prison along with his \"high priest\" Kerry Noble. Robert G. Millar became one of Ellison's spiritual advisers, and was also the founder of Elohim City. Ellison was also mentored by Richard Girnt Butler, founder of the Aryan Nations and Robert E. Miles, founder of the Mountain Church in Cohoctah, Michigan. Both extreme right-wing leaders taught and practiced the theology of Christian Identity, a belief system that the FBI includes on its watch list as an extremist religion. Ellison had close ties to the Ku Klux Klan and the Aryan Nations, based in Hayden Lake, Idaho, and led by Richard Girnt Butler, who was described as \"the glue of the Aryan Nations movement in the Northwest, if not the country\" by the supervisor of the Inland Northwest Joint Terrorism Task Force. Miles had a prison ministry and newsletter, relating mostly to the violent white Aryan groups, of which there are many, most notably, the Aryan Brotherhood. After Ellison was released from prison, he moved to Elohim City, where he married Millar's granddaughter.\n\nThe entire Council of Elders in the CSA community were deeply influenced and mentored by many outside sources. This nine-man council deliberated on both the spiritual meaning and the direction of CSA activities. Jim Ellison, Kerry Noble, and William Wade were the only known members of the council.\n\nIn June 1982, the CSA had an estimated 90 to 120 members, consisting of men, women, and children. In April 1984, the number of members had been reduced to less than 70.\n\nOther known members of The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord include:\n\nThe CSA was an organization which believed that doomsday was imminent, and the 224-acre compound that was set up in Elijah became a community for its members. There they trained their members in paramilitary operations. The group believed in white supremacy and was anti-Semitic. Like other prominent anti-Semitic groups that believed in antisemitic canards, they referred to the United States Government as \"ZOG\", short for Zionist Occupied Government. The military leader, who used the name Randall Rader during his stay at the CSA compound, left the group in a rift with Ellison and joined the newly forming group The Order in Idaho. The CSA initially professed the belief that the United States government would dissolve due to its corruption, whereas The Order advocated revolution. However, in July 1983, The CSA published a manifesto called A.T.T.A.C.K. (Aryan Tactical Treaty for the Advancement of Christ’s Kingdom) which declared a war against the government. This was seen by followers as the Second American Revolution.\n\nCSA assassins monitored the homes of their targets, practiced mock assassinations of these targets with scoped rifles, and practiced attacks in a mock residential training facility known as Silhouette City. The perimeter of the CSA compound had 100, 200, and indicator plates nailed to trees to allow the defenders to adjust their sights accordingly to engage attackers. The central rallying point in the event of an attack was a concrete bunkhouse that housed the communications radios next to the tower, which was constructed for defense. The perimeter of the compound had built-in bunkers for one to three men, and each was numbered as a post and assigned to individuals as an area of responsibility. \n\nThe line infantryman carried a Ruger Mini-14 .223 Remington rifle. As in the early days of the United States Marine Corps, the squads were set up in four-man fire teams. One man in the fire team carried a Heckler and Koch Model 91 rifle in .308 caliber. These had been modified via a technique that the organization sold to \"brother groups,\" converting the rifles to an illegal selective fire weapon (capable of firing either single shots or fully automatic). The Elite \"A\" Team had black clothing and some fairly sophisticated weapons, such as the .22 caliber Ruger target pistol fitted with an integral silencer, and several MAC-10 submachineguns in both 9  mm and .45 ACP, also with attached suppressors. These men trained in the covert aspects of military action and were to be the core of the defense initiative.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) later determined that the CSA had obtained 155 Krugerrands, one live light antitank rocket, 94 long arms, 30 handguns, 35 sawed-off shotguns, and machine guns, one heavy machine gun, and a quantity of C-4 explosives.\n\nWithin \"Silhouette City\", the CSA also ran a boot camp-style program known as the \"End Time Overcomer Survival Training School\" - which was conducted by Order member, Randall Rader. Here, the group trained an estimated 1,500 of like-minded Christian Identity adherents in combat techniques and paramilitary exercises. Upon completing this training, a newly-trained militant would leave to join or start other similar militia groups.\n\nThe CSA and its paramilitary arm taught basic pistol and rifle use as well as personal home defense, rural and urban warfare, weapons proficiency, general military fieldcraft, Christian martial arts, and natural wilderness survival.\n\nIn 1983, CSA member William Thomas accompanying Richard Wayne Snell and Steven Scott attempted to dynamite a natural gas pipeline which crossed the Red River on its way from the Gulf of Mexico to Chicago. This event ran as part of the group's A.T.T.A.C.K. operations. According to Kerry Noble, the group predicted this to result in riots (due to it being in winter). However, the trio was unsuccessful in carrying out the act of terror. \n\nThe CSA had links with other radical organizations, including the Aryan Brotherhood, the Mountain Church, and The Order, which were all dangerous white supremacist organizations which advocated the violent overthrow of the United States Government. Many of their members were seen traveling in and out of the compound, and after a search of the compound, several stolen vehicles including one belonging to The Order were recovered.\n\nAccording to a report conducted by the California Department of Justice, The Pagans Motorcycle Club provided the CSA with training in booby trap devices and survival techniques in return for weapons and ammunition.\n\nThings began to go downhill for the organization after Snell, an alleged member, was arrested for killing an African-American police officer. Snell was later tied to the killing of a gun store owner in 1981, obtaining and using the same gun, the serial number of which had been removed by the CSA armorer, Kent Yates. Yates was arrested on Friday, July 13, 1984, on an outstanding warrant out of New Mexico for firearms violations in Farmington. He was later also charged and convicted of weapons manufacture and modification for the CSA.\n\nAfter the incident with Snell, the FBI began to seek ways to infiltrate the CSA compound and stop the organization which was deemed dangerous. Its agents obtained warrants under Arkansas state law to arrest Ellison, the leader of the CSA, for multiple firearms violations. (The FBI later claimed that at all times it had an \"inside man\" in the CSA.)\n\nOn 16 April 1985, the FBI obtained a search warrant for the CSA compound.\n\nBeginning on 19 April 1985, the FBI and the ATF, led by the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team (HRT), positioned around 300 federal agents in Elijah. It was necessary to keep the operation a secret, but this was not easy in the small community. However, the FBI and ATF agents took advantage of Pontiac being a common destination for anglers by pretending to be fishermen and registering at different motels near the various fishing destinations. On the morning of 19 April, they moved in and surrounded the CSA compound, putting some of their agents in fishing boats to seal off the lakeside area of the compound. There they waited, until a few hours later when two guards emerged from the compound. They appeared to be unaware of the presence of the officers and walked towards a sniper hold-out until an officer yelled commands to return to the compound, with which the guards complied. Later, an unnamed individual emerged from the compound and talked with the federal agents and reported to Ellison that the FBI agents were outside and willing to negotiate his surrender and the emptying of the compound. Ellison emerged later. FBI agents had expected that he would not go down without a firefight, but the FBI negotiators convinced him that the CSA would certainly lose if they had one. They convinced him that they wanted peaceful cooperation, and he asked that his spiritual adviser, assumed to be Millar, come to the compound to instruct him. The individual was flown to the area and seemed eager to convince Ellison to stand down. They allowed the individual into the compound, and the FBI instructed him to call in every 30 minutes to report on how negotiations were going.\n\nU.S. Attorney Asa Hutchinson, who later successfully prosecuted Ellison and other leaders of the CSA, put on an FBI flak jacket and entered the compound to join the negotiations, leading to a peaceful conclusion to the armed stand-off. After several calls requesting more time, early on the morning of the fourth day of the siege, Arkansas State Police entered the compound and escorted out the remaining members without further bloodshed. Women and children had earlier been evacuated to nearby motels.\n\nEllison and most of his leadership were charged in federal court with illegal weapons possession and racketeering. In September 1985, Ellison, Kerry Noble, and four other CSA members (Gary Stone, Timothy Russell, Rudy Loewen, and David Giles) were sentenced to lengthy federal prison terms. A seventh CSA member, Stephen Scott, pleaded guilty in an Arkansas federal court to charges he dynamited a natural gas pipeline near Fulton, Arkansas in 1983, and was also sent to prison. Ex-CSA member Kent Yates also pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to make and transfer automatic weapons silencers.\n\nEllison faced the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison after he was convicted on federal racketeering and weapons charges. However, Ellison was released in 1987 after agreeing to testify against the leader and six senior members of the Aryan Nations. All seven men were arrested and indicted on charges of sedition. The jury found all the defendants not guilty on all charges. Upon his release from federal prison, Ellison moved to Elohim City.\n\nRichard Wayne Snell, the man who shot and killed the police officer and a pawn shop owner, was sentenced to death by lethal injection, which was carried out on 19 April 1995, the same day as the Oklahoma City bombing.\n\nThere are several claims that the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was tied to the \"New Day\" teachings of Elohim City. No proof, however, has been established. Elohim City was assembled to gather \"prophets of the New Day\". Leader Robert G. Millar envisioned himself to be the \"Shepherd of Shepherds\" traveling to numerous alternative societies, many of which were and are still communes. His ambition was to unite these underground organizations. He appeared several times at the Padanaram Settlement, in southern Indiana, but contrary to reports, members of the Padanaram Settlement did not concur with the radical callings of either Millar or Ellison, who made two appearances there. \"The Valley\" was and still is known more for being a cultural hub for artists and philosophers, and until roughly 2003 it operated a sawmill.\n\nTimothy McVeigh, who was convicted and executed for perpetrating the Oklahoma City bombing, had no association with the CSA and had just enlisted in the U.S Army when the CSA compound was besieged and broken up. The Oklahoma City bombing occurred exactly on the 10th anniversary of the start of the siege of the CSA compound in 1985. The most plausible link is the fact that Richard Wayne Snell, who was executed on the day of the Oklahoma City bombing, had planned a similar attack on the Murrah building in 1983 after becoming upset with the Internal Revenue Service. Additionally, Snell was heard taunting jailers that something drastic would happen on the day of his execution. However, McVeigh has stated that he chose the date of 19 April to coincide with the violent end of the Waco siege exactly two years prior. McVeigh had traveled and visited Waco during the 51-day siege and cited it and 1992 Ruby Ridge events as his primary motivation for carrying out the bombing.\n\nThe single incident in which the CSA was involved, the robbery of a pawn shop in Springfield, Missouri, was in fact, foiled by a CSA member on the orders of Jim Ellison, unknown to Wayne Snell, who headed up the plan. It was regarding this event in which Ellison saw a \"sign from God\" which he interpreted to mean that they should not carry out the attempt; not the attack on the Oklahoma City Federal Building.\n\nThe death knell of the CSA was its attempt to kill FBI special agent Jack Knox, the lead agent assigned to investigate the group; Asa Hutchinson, the federal prosecutor; and the federal judge who presided over the affair that brought about the eventual action against Gordon Kahl, a tax protester and a member of the Posse Comitatus, by federal agents at CSA member, Leonard Ginter's home (called 'The Bunker', due to its construction from concrete covered with earth). Ellison revered Kahl as a hero. Like McVeigh, Kahl was a decorated American soldier; Kahl earned a Silver Star in the Korean War, and McVeigh earned a Bronze Star in the first Gulf War – Desert Storm.\n\nIn 2013, Kerry Noble appeared on the Investigation Discovery show \"Dangerous Persuasions\" talking about his time with the group. He was also interviewed for an episode of \"Brainwashed\" on the Slice Network in Canada and discussed his time with the CSA.\n\nThe Discovery Channel crime series \"The FBI Files\"' sixth season featured an episode whose topic was the CSA. The episode reveals the details of the federal investigation into the group, the 1985 siege, and the aftermath. The episode originally aired 10 December 2002.\n\n"}
{"id": "1851606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851606", "title": "Diamond Multimedia", "text": "Diamond Multimedia\n\nDiamond Multimedia is an American company that specializes in many forms of multimedia technology. They have produced graphics cards, motherboards, modems, sound cards and MP3 players, however the company began with the production of the TrackStar, a PC add-on card which emulated Apple II computers. They were one of the major players in the 2D and early 3D graphics card competition throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThe company was founded by Chong Moon Lee and H. H. Huh, who acted as the technical designer. Diamond Multimedia later merged with S3, Incorporated in 1999 after a long-time cooperative business arrangement, when S3 decided to expand their business from producing graphics chipsets to manufacturing retail graphics cards. The move paralleled the 1999 3dfx purchase of STB Systems, which changed 3dfx from a graphics chipset supplier to companies including Diamond, into a vertically-integrated graphics vendor and direct competitor to S3. However, the first major product after the merger, branded as the S3 Savage 2000, was a commercial failure. Growth in the add-on sound card market, also an ongoing Diamond business, was tempered by the 2000 bankruptcy of Aureal Semiconductor and subsequent asset purchase by vertically-integrated Creative Technologies.\n\nWith these market failures, the new combined Diamond/S3 company decided to change direction and leave the PC addon-board market. SONICblue was formed. Diamond Multimedia resurfaced in 2003 after the brand and assets had been purchased by Best Data. Diamond again built expansion boards.\n\nThe company was the defendant in a significant copyright case for its Rio digital music player, which the Recording Industry Association of America claimed infringed copyrights; the Ninth Circuit deemed it to be a fair use, however, in \"RIAA v. Diamond\".\n\nDiamond Multimedia is a subsidiary of Tul Corporation.\n\nDiamond's earliest line, now defunct, was the SpeedStar series, initially based on the Tseng Labs ET4000 and ET4000AX chipsets, and expanded further in additional releases. The SpeedStar line was launched as a series of high-performance ISA graphics cards that excelled in MS-DOS applications up through the early 1990s. However, as Microsoft Windows gained market share and newer graphics products entered the market, it was later relegated to the cheaper, value-oriented products and the SpeedStar branding was expanded to other products.\n\nPartial listing of Speedstar-branded models\n\nThe Stealth cards of the 2D era were first launched in the early 1990s and were usually based on GUI accelerators from S3 Graphics. The line later included chipsets with combined 2D and 3D capabilities. Initially the Stealth line was Diamond's high-end brand but transitioned to midrange after the Viper line was introduced.\n\nNotable members of the Stealth family have been the Diamond Stealth 3D 2000, by far the most popular S3 Virge-based board. The Diamond Stealth32, using the Tseng Labs ET4000/W32p chipset, was capable of impressive price/performance, especially in DOS. The Diamond Stealth64 Graphics 2001, with the ARK 2000PV/MT chipset, was known for excellent DOS performance at the time. The Diamond Stealth II S220, using the Rendition Verite V2100 2D/3D accelerator, was popular with enthusiasts for its excellent price/performance for both 2D and 3D gaming. A special BIOS patch was released by Diamond for the Stealth II S220 which brought its clock speed up to the same level as the high-end Verite V2200 chip, resulting in equal performance at a significantly lower price.\n\nIn the middle of the Stealth line-up, Diamond chose to implement a numbering scheme to differentiate their cards. For example, the Diamond Stealth Video VRAM was rechristened the Diamond Stealth Video 3xxx. The numbers had more than a random meaning. Specifically, they tell the buyer the card's memory amount and type. The Stealth Video 3240 uses VRAM (3), is equipped with 2MB initially (2), and is upgradeable to 4MB (4). If the first digit was (2), then the card used standard DRAM.\n\nThe numbering scheme confused many people since Diamond just renamed current cards with new names. The Stealth Video 3240 was simply the old Stealth Video VRAM. New cards did also use the scheme, however, such as the S3 Trio64V+ cards.\n\nPartial listing of Stealth-branded models\n\nThe Diamond Edge 3D was the first consumer 3D accelerator card, based on the NVIDIA NV1 chipset. The boards were designed to be an all-encompassing entertainment solution, as the chipset and board included full 2D/3D acceleration, an audio engine capable of General MIDI synthesis, and the ability to use Sega Saturn gamepad controllers.\n\nThe architecture of the NV1 predates the Microsoft Direct3D philosophy and, as such, game compatibility was a problem with the Diamond Edge boards. Limited and slow Direct3D-supporting drivers did eventually show up, but performance was inadequate and buggy. The audio engine further received poor reviews regarding MIDI quality, which was a common standard for multimedia music playback at the time.\n\nListing of Edge 3D-branded boards\n\nThe Monster3D line was based on 3dfx Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo2 chips which did not contain a 2D engine, requiring a separate VGA card connected externally using a pass-through cable. When the 3D engine was called into use, the 3dfx-based card would disconnect the 2D pass-through signal and begin driving the display directly. Both Voodoo and Voodoo2 based offerings were in production until the STB-3dfx merger. The series was highly successful as the Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo2 chipsets introduced consumer-grade 3D graphics into the PC and arcade markets, whereas such capabilities had previously been present primarily in very high-end CAD and graphic design workstations.\n\nA critically acclaimed feature of the Monster 3D II (and all other Voodoo2 boards) was the capability to connect two identical boards in a SLI (Scan-line Interleave) configuration. In SLI, a pair of Voodoo2 boards splits the effort of rendering the 3D scene between alternating raster lines, allowing performance to be nearly doubled.\n\nListing of Monster 3D-branded boards\n\nThe Viper line was Diamond's high-end offering. Initially it consisted of a graphics accelerator board for VLB or PCI that was a combination of two graphics chips. For non-GUI environments such as DOS, the original Viper used an Oak Technology OTI-087 display chip with its own 256 KB DRAM. This chip was rather slow and basic. The Viper SE card moved to a Weitek 5186 chip with 1 MB DRAM for non-GUI functions. For GUI environments such as Windows, the Viper cards used a Weitek graphics co-processor which accelerated many drawing functions and performed very well for its time. The original Viper used the Weitek P9000/P9001, while the Viper SE used a Weitek P9100, both lines equipped with 2-4 MB VRAM. The separate slow DOS chip was a problem for owners who played DOS games because these chips were quite slow and had limited and buggy VESA BIOS Extensions implementations. While the GUI accelerator was very capable, drivers from Diamond were rather buggy and were only revised a few times during the lifetime of the card.\n\nTowards the end of the 1990s, the Viper line consisted of NVIDIA-based graphics cards. The Diamond Viper V330 used the highly integrated RIVA 128 accelerator that featured very capable 2D, 3D and video acceleration. The later Diamond Viper V550 and V770 utilized the RIVA TNT and RIVA TNT2 accelerators which were evolutions of the RIVA 128.\n\nIn 1999, Diamond was acquired by S3 Graphics and became primarily a supplier of products based upon their graphics accelerator chips. The Diamond Viper II Z200 was based upon the S3 Savage 2000, a supposed NVIDIA GeForce 256 killer. Unfortunately the chip itself was not fully functional and the drivers were very buggy.\n\nPartial listing of Viper-branded boards\n\nThe name \"FireGL\" stands for Diamond's workstation-class 2D/3D graphics cards. This brand was originally created decades ago as just \"Fire\" by the design team of the professional computer graphics pioneer SPEA Software AG from Starnberg (Germany) that was about 1996 acquired by Diamond.\n\nProducts whilst under the hood of Diamond were:\n\n\nThe FireGL team was bought by ATI (later AMD) in 2001 once the combined Diamond/S3 dropped out of the graphics market to form SONICblue. ATI continues the Fire GL lineup.\n\nAs of September 2007, thus long after that business, Diamond was also preparing a new video card, based on the latest-generation R600 graphics core. This was the same core as used for ATI driven FireGL V8650 and V8600 cards. Diamond altered the PCB reference design and labeled their device VFX 2000 series professional workstation graphics card. It came with at least 2 GB GDDR4 memory on board.\n\nRadeon HD series.\n\nPartial listing of Radeon HD branded models\n\n\nThe Diamond Monster Sound gaming sound card series was the first sound card to have its own on-board processor to handle audio operations. The Monster Sound cards were the first to support hardware mixing acceleration with Microsoft's new DirectSound and DirectSound3D audio APIs. Most, if not all, also supported Aureal's burgeoning A3D API.\n\nThe original Monster Sound card was distinct in this regard, but also controversial because it possessed poor DOS game compatibility which was still critical at the time. DOS game audio was only functional within a Windows 95 DOS box. It came equipped with a 2MB AdMOS MIDI daughterboard.\n\nThe Monster Sound M80 was similar to the original Monster Sound, but lacked 4 speaker support. It also had a reduced quality AdMOS MIDI daughterboard (1MB).\n\nMonster Sound MX200 had excellent General MIDI quality because of the high quality patch set (licensed from Roland) it was equipped with on its 4MB Dream daughtercard. Otherwise it was technically identical to the original Monster Sound.\n\nThe Diamond Monster Sound MX300 was based on the Vortex2 audio ASIC from Aureal Semiconductor. It was a substantial step forward in gaming audio, with impressive 3D audio positioning and other effects. It utilized the then state-of-the-art Aureal A3D 2.0 3D audio API.\n\nMonster Sound MX400 was advertised as being one of the first sound cards with hardware MP3 decoding acceleration. This was a redundant feature because the central CPUs in PCs at the time were more than capable of handling MP3 playback. It was also somewhat complicated to make use of the MP3 acceleration because special software was needed to use it.\n\nThe Vortex2-equipped MX300 was a superior card for 3D audio. Aureal had gone into bankruptcy and was dissolved, so their last generation of chips were never released. Diamond instead used ESS's less powerful chips to continue the line. The MX400 was the last of the Monster Sound cards.\n\n\nThe Sonic Impact was the value-oriented sound card line from Diamond. Whereas the MonsterSound lineup was targeted at no-holds-barred gamers, the Sonic Impact cards were more generally aimed, and were cheaper and less powerful. Still the lineup consisted of several capable cards.\n\n\nDiamond XtremeSound is the first sound card line launched after the company's restructuring in 2003.\n\n\n\nDiamond's first product (under the corporate name Diamond Computer Systems) was the TrackSTAR, an 8-bit ISA plug-in card for the IBM PC that emulated an Apple II. An early advertisement from 1984 also claimed it would add CP/M compatibility via the included Z80 processor. The TrackSTAR was redesigned to fit in the shorter expansion slot of the Tandy 1000 and was key to that marque's expansion into the educational computer market.\n\nDiamond's innovation created the Rio PMP300, one of the first consumer MP3 players, but they soon sold their MP3 player line and no longer provide support for it.\n\nThe SupraMax line is a popular value DSL modem line. The brand has a lineage going back to Supra, Inc..\n\nDiamond began manufacturing PC-compatible motherboards after purchasing Micronics Computers Inc. in 1998.\n\nDiamond was an early (1997) entrant into PC DVD kits with their Maximum DVD 1000DB-VAR (Value Added Reseller) and 2000-RETKIT (RETail KIT).\nThese kits bundled a 'feature reduced' (several pin headers and other parts not installed) full length PCI MPEG2 analog overlay decoder card made by divion. This card connected to the VGA card with an external passthrough cable, a 3.5mm (1/8\") external patch cord to the soundcard's line-in jack, and the analog audio cable from the included Toshiba SD-M1002 DVD-ROM drive connected to the divion card while a second cable passed the audio on to the soundcard's internal connector.\n\nDiamond also made kits called the Maximum DVD 1500 and 2500. (Hardware specifications unknown.) The drivers and player software for these are not compatible with the DVD 1000 and 2000. They are a slightly newer product with the 'Navigator' player software having a cleaner user interface.\n\nNone of these DVD kits are DirectX compatible and as the drivers are the VxD type, they will only work with Windows 95 through 98SE. Dual-layer DVDs are not supported in original Windows 95 or 95a, but are in the various versions of 95 OEM Service Release 2. Windows 98 or 98SE is not recommended due to problems that may happen with video color and alignment. Only the bundled player software can use the hardware MPEG2 decoding of the card.\n\nDiamond produced the capable but relatively low-cost FirePort 40 SCSI adapter in the late 1990s.\n\n"}

It is located at the 63 kilometer marker on the road from Guayaquil to Manabí. It is the seat of Pedro Carbo Cantón, founded in 1984. As of the census of 2001, there are 36,711 people residing within canton limits. A new census was conducted in 2010 but results are yet unknown. The city is named after Pedro Carbo Noboa, a 19th-century politician, diplomat and writer from Guayaquil.\n\nThe area now known as Pedro Carbo was once called \"Rio Nuevo\" (new river) and was an important town in the parroquia \"San Juan de Soledad\", now known as the town of Isidro Ayora (located to the east of Pedro Carbo). On August 1, 1893 the name was changed to Caamaño and was designated a rural parroquia of the cantón Daule, located to the east. The town kept the name Caamaño until 1895 during the Liberal Revolution, when its name was changed to honor Pedro Carbo Noboa. In the Territorial Division Law of 1897, the change was officially documented. Finally on July 12, 1984 the president of the Republic, Dr. Oswaldo Hurtado Larrea, declared the formation of Cantón Pedro Carbo, which was published in the Civil Registry N° 790 on July 19, 1984\n\nPedro Carbo is named after Pedro Carbo Noboa, a politician, diplomat and writer. He was born in Guayaquil March 19, 1813, son of Coronel José Carbo Unzueta and Mrs. Josefa Noboa. He grew up in Guayaquil then moved to Mexico for a time before returning to Guayaquil. He became a public figure in 1835 when he was appointed Official Mayor of the Ministry of Interior and Exterior Relations. His subsequent political roles include Secretary of the Encoder Commission, Secretary of Ecuadorian Legation and worked in business negotiations with New Granada and Peru.\n\nIn 1845 he was named General Minister of the Provisional Government after the Marxist Revolution. As a commissioner for the government of Guayaquil, he also played an integral part in the negotiations of terms for the Virginia Treaty. He attended the National Convention as the Deputy of the Province of Guayas in 1845 and later represented the provinces of Guayas, Pinchincha and Chimborazo in various Assemblies. He was proposed as a presidential candidate in 1864 but did not run and instead focused his energies on attacking the regime of Gabriel García Moreno, after which he went into exile in Paris then Peru. He died December 24, 1894.\n\nPedro Carbo is located in the coastal province of Guayas, Ecuador. It is located at the 63 kilometer marker on the road from Guayaquil to Manabí.\n\nTerritorial Limits\n\nNorth and East: Paján Canton (Manabí Province)\n\nSouth: Santa Elena Canton (Santa Elena Province)\n\nEast: Isidro Ayora Canton and Colimes Canton (Province of Guayas)\n\nArea: Cantón Pedro Carbo has an area of 363.7 mi2 (942 km2)\n\nClimate: The annual average temperature is 80.6 °F (27 °C) with an average yearly rainfall of 31.2 inches (79.3 cm). Most of the high temperatures and rainfall occur during the hot rainy season (invierno) which lasts from mid-December to mid-June, while the cooler dry season (verano) lasts from mid-June to mid-December. Part of the cantón consists of dry tropical forests, which contain a diverse ecosystem with a wide variety of flora and fauna. The river \"Pedro Carbo\" which only has water during the rainy season, passes through the cantón and is a source of water for agriculture and tourism.\n\nThe area is primarily agriculturally based with a majority of families with at least one member of the household working in some form of agriculture.\n\nThe primary crops are rice, corn, sunflowers (for cooking oil), peanuts, a variety of beans, mangos, and bananas. In areas near water sources is where the most diversity in crops can be found. Cattle and goats are the primary animal husbandry products. Many residents also use local reeds and wood in craft trades, such as expert woodworkers and Panama hat weavers. The streets are lined with merchants selling a wide variety of products, from fruits and vegetables, to street food, to clothing and items for the home.\n\nThe two main local holidays in Pedro Carbo are:\n\n-The celebration in honor of Saint Pablo and Saint Pedro, the patron saints of the cantón. Celebrated June 29 each year.\n\n-The celebration of the date when Pedro Carbo was declared a cantón. Celebrated July 19 each year.\n\nThe town has a variety of other celebrations and holidays throughout the year, including many international celebration and recognition days. Holidays are typically celebrated with a parade down the main street, public dances, and social ceremonies.\n\nCurrent political leaders of Cantón Pedro Carbo (2019–2022):\n\n• Mayor: Xavier Gomez Salazar \n• Deputy Mayor: Dr. Virgilio Ordóñez Ramirez\n\n• General Secretary: Abg.

The United States release of the film is distributed by Destination Films and features the voices of Kirsten Dunst, Richard Harris (in his last role before his death), Anjelica Huston, Keith David and Ciara Janson.\n\nChris Delaporte started work on the film in 1995 after leaving at Éric Chahi's company Amazing Studio halfway through development of the Studio's only game Heart of Darkness. Originally intended as a video game, the project spun off into a film. There was however a tie-in video game produced.\n\nIt was both critical and commercial failure.\n\nThe film begins with an alien ship crash landing on a desert planet. The alien survivors, known as Vecarians, are quickly killed by the planet's predatory native inhabitants, the Selenites. The ship's core, Vecanoi, survives, and from it sprouts Axis, a massive tree reaching up into space.\n\n600 years later, a race of human-like tree-dwellers have evolved living in the branches of Axis. One of them, a teenager named Kaena (voiced by Kirsten Dunst), is an adventurous daydreamer who longs to explore the world beyond the confines of her village. Kaena's inquisitiveness is opposed as heresy by the village elder, who commands his people to stay productive and toil for the villager's gods (who are, unbeknownst to them, the Selenites living in the planet below).\n\nLed by prophetic dreams of a world with a blue sun and plentiful water, Kaena eventually defies the elder and climbs to the top of Axis. There, she encounters the ancient alien Opaz (voiced by Richard Harris), the last survivor of the Vecarian race that crash landed on the planet centuries ago. Opaz has used his technology to evolve a race of intelligent worms to serve him and help him escape the planet. Upon learning of Kaena's dreams, Opaz enlists her help in retrieving Vecanoi, which contains the collective memory of his people.\n\nHowever, Vecanoi rests at the base of Axis, where the Selenites dwell. The Queen of the Selenites (voiced by Anjelica Huston) blames Vecanoi for the destruction of their planet, and has spent most of her life (and sacrificed the future of her people) attempting to destroy it.\n\n\n\nThe project started as a video game in 1995.\n\n\"Kaena\" was a box office bomb and earned terrible reviews. \"The New York Times\", Entertainment Weekly, \"The L.A. Times\" and \"The Boston Globe\" all agreed it was a lifeless, dull cartoon with an overly convoluted plot. There were unflattering comparisons to a much better-received French animated film, \"The Triplets of Belleville\", and the similarly unsuccessful CG film \"\". A few nevertheless admired the visuals. The proportions of the main character drew comparisons to Lara Croft.\n\n"}

He was born in Roosevelt, New York and attended Syracuse University. He was the first president of the National Football League Players Association following the AFL-NFL merger, serving from 1970 to 1973. Mackey was also a major reason the NFLPA created the \"88 Plan\", which financially supports ex-players who required living assistance in later years.\n\nA five-time Pro Bowler, Mackey was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1992, the second pure tight end elected.\n\nMackey played three seasons at Syracuse University (1960-1962), alternating between the running back, tight end, and wide receiver position. His first two seasons were on the same team as Ernie Davis, the 1961 Heisman Trophy winner. Mackey caught a total of 27 passes for 481 yards and 5 touchdowns, while also rushing for 259 yards and 4 more scores. As a Junior, he set a school record with 321 receiving yards, and caught 4 passes in Syracuse's 15-14 win over the University of Miami in the 1961 Liberty Bowl. In Mackey's three seasons, Syracuse had a 20-10 record and won the Liberty Bowl each year.\n\nMackey was drafted by the Baltimore Colts with the 19th pick in the second round of the 1963 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he averaged over 20 yards per catch, scored seven touchdowns, and earned a trip to the Pro Bowl. He also returned 9 kickoffs for 271 yards, an average of 30 yards per return.\n\nHe went on to play a total of 10 NFL seasons as tight end, and became known for his size and speed. Mackey played his first nine seasons with the Colts before leaving the team in 1971. He played his final season with the San Diego Chargers, retiring at the end of the 1972 season. Although a knee injury forced him into early retirement, Mackey only missed one game in his whole career.\n\nDuring his 10 seasons in the NFL, Mackey scored 38 touchdowns and caught 331 passes for 5,236 yards. He also rushed 19 times for 127 yards. His career yards per catch average of 15.8 is currently the second highest total among all Hall of Fame tight ends, trailing only Jackie Smith.\n\nMackey played in Super Bowl V on January 17, 1971. He was involved in a famous game-changing play where he caught a record-setting 75 yard pass from quarterback Johnny Unitas after the ball was deflected twice, once by fellow Colts player Eddie Hinton and once by opposing Dallas Cowboys defenseman Mel Renfro. Baltimore won the game 16–13, following a 32-yard field goal by Jim O'Brien with five seconds left.\n\nDuring his playing career, Mackey played in five Pro Bowls, including in his rookie season. He was also named All-NFL three times. In 1992, Mackey was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming only the second pure tight end to be awarded this honor.\n\nMackey has been included in several lists of great NFL players. In 1999, \"The Sporting News\" ranked Mackey at 48 on their list of \"The 100 Greatest Football Players.\" He also placed at number 42 on the NFL Network's list of the \"Top 100 Football Players\" in 2010.\n\nIn 2001, the John Mackey Award was established by the Nassau County Sports Commission. The award is given yearly to the top college tight end. On September 15, 2007, Mackey's alma mater, Syracuse University, retired number 88 in his honor.\n\nOn September 27, 2017, Mackey was installed, posthumously, into the Nassau County High School Athletic Hall of Fame as an athlete. His widow, Sylvia, accepted the honor on his behalf. This was the third class of the Hall of fame, which is housed in the renovated Nassau County Veterans' Memorial Coliseum.\n\nIn 1970, Mackey became the first president of the National Football League Players Association following the merger of the National Football League and the American Football League. Although the NFL and AFL each had a candidate for president in mind, Mackey emerged as the leader both sides could agree on. Mackey held the position of president until September 1973.\n\nIn his first year as president, Mackey organized a strike following a lockout by owners, with NFL players seeking additional pension contributions and insurance benefits, as well as higher pre- and post-season pay. The strike resulted in increased fringe benefits for NFL players totalling more than $12 million. According to former teammate Ordell Braase, Mackey \"had a vision for that job, which was more than just putting in time and keeping the natives calm. You don't get anything unless you really rattle the cage.\" In 1972, Mackey became the lead plaintiff in a court action which led to the overturning of the so-called \"Rozelle Rule,\" which limited a player's ability to act as a free agent. In 1976, the Rozelle Rule was ruled to violate antitrust laws in \"Mackey v. NFL\".\n\nSeveral years after retiring from the NFL, Mackey began to suffer from symptoms of dementia. In one notorious incident at an airport checkpoint, Mackey refused to remove his Super Bowl and Hall of Fame rings at the metal detector. When a guard insisted he take them off, Mackey bolted through the checkpoint. It took four guards to subdue him. “I’m just so thankful they didn’t shoot him because they had no idea about his mental condition,’’ His wife Sylvia said after the incident. “They easily could have mistaken him for being a bomb-toting terrorist.”\n\nHis condition eventually worsened, and his family was forced to put him into a full-time assisted living facility. Although Mackey received a small pension, it was not sufficient to cover the costs of his care, leading his wife Sylvia to reach out to NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue.\n\nOnce made aware of the problem, Tagliabue and NFLPA executive director Gene Upshaw responded with the \"88 plan\" in February 2007. Named for Mackey's jersey number, the plan provides $88,000 per year for nursing home care and up to $50,000 annually for adult day care for former NFL players, including Mackey, suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's. Mackey died July 6, 2011 at the age of 69. It was revealed by a study by the University of Boston on his brain that he died of chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\n"}
{"id": "1851663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851663", "title": "John Mackey (businessman)", "text": "John Mackey (businessman)\n\nJohn Powell Mackey (born August 15, 1953) is an American businessman and writer. He is the CEO of Whole Foods Market, which he co-founded in 1980. Named Ernst & Young entrepreneur of the year in 2003, Mackey is a strong supporter of free market economics, has strong anti-union views, and co-wrote the best-selling book \"Conscious Capitalism\", which was released in 2013. He is one of the most influential advocates in the movement for organic food.\n\nMackey was born on August 15, 1953, in Houston, Texas, the son of Margaret Wescott (Powell) and William Sturges \"Bill\" Mackey, Jr. He has a sister and a brother.\n\nJohn Mackey's father Bill was a professor of accounting, CEO of LifeMark, a health-care company, and investor of Whole Foods Market, before he died in 2004. In the abstract to the book: \"Conscious Capitalism\", Mackey thanks his father for teaching him valuable life lessons.\n\nMackey's mother Margaret died in 1987, when John was thirty-four years of age. John and Margaret had a strained relationship, partly due to her desire for a different future regarding her son. Margaret felt that such a “fine mind” should devote its time doing something more productive than retailing. John did not agree, but in later years he regretted that he did not make it more clear that he loved her.\n\nMackey was a student of philosophy and religion at the University of Texas at Austin and Trinity University in the 1970s, and worked at a vegetarian co-op. Mackey spent almost six years studying various topics, deciding to focus solely on his interests and not purely seek out a degree. Mackey credits his generalist approach to learning as the main reason he was able to be successful in business. Mackey, who was a vegetarian for 30 years, now identifies as a vegan.\n\nMackey co-founded his first health food store, SaferWay, with his girlfriend Renee Lawson (Hardy) in Austin in 1978. They met while living in a vegetarian housing co-op. They dropped out of college.\n\nThey borrowed $10,000 and raised $35,000 more to start SaferWay. At the time, Austin had several small health food stores. The two ran the market on the first floor, a health food restaurant on the second, and, for a short time, lived in the third story of their building. In two years, they merged SaferWay with Clarksville Natural Grocery run by Mark Skiles and Craig Weller and renamed the business Whole Foods Market. All four (Mackey, Hardy-Lawson, Skiles and Weller) are considered co-founders of the business.\n\nMackey built Whole Foods into a multinational organization, with outlets in major markets across the country, as well as Canada and the United Kingdom. Along the way he bought out smaller competitors. In 2007 Whole Foods purchased a major natural foods supermarket competitor, Wild Oats Markets, Inc.\n\nMackey serves on multiple nonprofit boards of directors - including Students For Liberty, Global Animal Partnership, Conscious Capitalism and the Humane Society of the United States.\n\nWhole Foods was the first grocery chain to set standards for humane animal treatment. Mackey was influenced by animal rights activist, Lauren Ornelas, who criticized Whole Foods' animal standards regarding ducks at a shareholder meeting in 2003. Mackey gave Ornelas his email address and they corresponded on the issue. He studied issues related to factory farming and decided to switch to a primarily vegan diet that included only eggs from his own chickens. Since 2006, he has followed an entirely plant-based diet. He advocates tougher animal standards.\n\nDespite Whole Foods' welfare standards, Mackey has been criticized by abolitionist vegans such as Gary L. Francione, who believes the Whole Foods company policies betray the animal rights position. By other accounts, Mackey is the \"driving force\" behind significant changes in animal welfare. For instance, he started a non-profit foundation, the Animal Compassion Foundation, to address making animal welfare more economically viable. The Animal Compassion Foundation folded in 2008 with the formation of the Global Animal Partnership, a nonprofit organization that is independent of Whole Foods Market. Mackey is on the Board of Directors of Global Animal Partnership. Additionally, he is a board member of Farm Forward, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that implements innovative strategies to promote conscientious food choices, reduce farmed animal suffering, and advance sustainable agriculture, and he has been a member of the Board of Directors for the Humane Society of the United States since 2009.\n\nIn 2006, Mackey announced he was reducing his salary to $1 a year, would donate his stock portfolio to charity, and set up a $100,000 emergency fund for staff facing personal problems. He wrote: \"I am now 53 years old and I have reached a place in my life at which I no longer want to work for money, but simply for the joy of the work itself and to better answer the call to service that I feel so clearly in my own heart.\"\n\nHe has instituted caps on executive pay at the company.\n\nOn July 20, 2007, \"The Wall Street Journal\" revealed that Mackey was, for at least seven years, using the pseudonym \"Rahodeb\" (an anagram of his wife's name, Deborah) to post to Yahoo Finance forums. He referred to himself in the third person and criticized rival supermarket chain Wild Oats Markets. The Federal Trade Commission approved a complaint challenging Whole Foods Market's approximately $670 million acquisition of its chief rival, Wild Oats Markets, Inc. It authorized the FTC staff to seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in federal district court to halt the deal, pending an administrative trial on the merits. After an extensive regulatory battle with the FTC, a federal appeals court consented to the deal. Whole Foods officially completed their buyout of Wild Oats on August 27, 2007.\n\nIn May 2008, after an SEC investigation cleared him, Mackey started blogging again. In a 2,037 word post, he wrote about why he began blogging in the first place and how his upbringing drove him to defend himself and Whole Foods. He admitted he made a mistake in judgment, but not in ethics.\n\nOn December 24, 2009, Mackey resigned from the position of Chairman of the Board of Whole Foods Market, a position he held since 1978. On his blog he said, \"John Elstrott will now take the title of Chairman of the Board, which will accurately reflect the authority and the responsibilities that he has had for many years.\" Mackey remains a member of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn a debate in the October 2005 issue of \"Reason\" magazine among Mackey, economist Milton Friedman, and entrepreneur T. J. Rodgers, Mackey said that he is a free-market libertarian. He said that he used to be a democratic socialist in college. As a beginning businessman, he was challenged by workers for not paying adequate wages and by customers for overcharging, during a time when he was having difficulty breaking even. He began to take a more capitalistic worldview, and discovered the works of Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and Milton Friedman. Mackey is an admirer of some of Ayn Rand's novels.\n\nMackey co-founded the organization Freedom Lights Our World (FLOW) to combine his commitments to \"economic and political freedom as well as personal growth, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship.\" He supports such changes as green tax shifts, environmental trusts, world legal systems to allow the poor to create legal businesses, and a citizen's dividend to help the poor in the developed world. The name and focus of FLOW have since become Conscious Capitalism, Inc., which was initially created as a program of FLOW and evolved to the point at which it became the organization's principal focus. In 2010 the name of the organization was formally changed. The Conscious Capitalism Institute was chartered in 2009. In 2010 the original FLOW group merged with the Institute group to become one unified organization. In 2013, Mackey was interviewed on \"Harvard Business Review\"s Ideacast podcast about his views on conscious business. Mackey said, \"If you want to be competitive in the long term, your business needs to have discovered its higher purpose and it needs to adopt a stakeholder philosophy\". He eschewed the conventional thinking that \"business has to be sort of ruthless and heartless to be successful\".\n\nMackey opposed the public health insurance option that ultimately did not become part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Mackey asserted that a better plan would be allowing consumers to purchase health insurance across state lines and use a combination of health savings accounts and catastrophic insurance, as Whole Foods does. Mackey's statement that Americans do not have an intrinsic right to healthcare led to calls for a boycott of Whole Foods Market from the \"Progressive Review\" and from numerous groups on Facebook. Alternatively, Tea Party movement advocates organized a number of buycotts in support of Mackey's suggestions.\n\nIn August 2009, Mackey wrote the editorial in the \"Wall Street Journal\" expressing his viewpoints on universal healthcare in the United States. \"While we clearly need health-care reform, the last thing our country needs is a massive new health-care entitlement that will create hundreds of billions of dollars of new unfunded deficits and move us much closer to a government takeover of our health-care system,\" he wrote. He continued: \"Many promoters of health-care reform believe that people have an intrinsic ethical right to health careto equal access to doctors, medicines and hospitals. While all of us empathize with those who are sick, how can we say that all people have more of an intrinsic right to health care than they have to food or shelter?\"\n\nIn an NPR interview in 2013, Mackey compared the Obama administration's healthcare law to \"fascism\" instead of socialism, stating, \"[t]echnically speaking, it's more like fascism. Socialism is where the government owns the means of production. In fascism, the government doesn't own the means of production, but they do control itand that's what's happening with our health care programs and these reforms.\" The day following the interview, Mackey wrote that he regretted having made the remark, stating that he \"made a poor word choice to describe [the U.S.] healthcare system.\" Instead, he called it \"government-controlled health care\".\n\nMackey is known for his strong anti-union views, having once compared unions to herpes in that \"it won't kill you, but it's very unpleasant and will make a lot of people not want to be your lover.\" Whole Foods Market, along with Costco and Starbucks, teamed up in 2008 to create an alternative to the Employee Free Choice Act. The three companies invited other corporations, unions and public interest groups to join them, proposing instead that unions be given more access to meet with workers, stricter penalties for labor violations and a guaranteed right to request secret ballots in all circumstances.\n\nMackey commented in 2005:\n\"It's illegal in the United States for there to be company unionsspecial unions which are formed and controlled by the employees and managers of the company to represent their interests and collectively bargain on their behalf. These type of unions are legal in many countries such as Japan, but are illegal in the United States. Instead the law requires that all unions be outside unions. I believe this law should be repealed and that company unions should be as legal as any other kind of voluntary association.\"\n\nMackey does not consider himself to be a skeptic of scientific opinion on climate change (see Climate change denial). Nevertheless, he rejects the scientific evidence for dangerous anthropogenic global warming, believing instead that \"climate change is perfectly natural and not necessarily bad.\"\n\nIn a 2010 discussion of books on his reading stack with journalist Nick Paumgarten, Mackey explained his views on human-caused climate change were similar to those of Australian geologist and author Ian Plimer:\n...Mackey told me that he agrees with the book [ \"Heaven and Earth\" ]'s assertion that, as he put it, \"no scientific consensus exists\" regarding the causes of climate change; he added, with a candor you could call bold or reckless, that it would be a pity to allow \"hysteria about global warming\" to cause us \"to raise taxes and increase regulation, and in turn lower our standard of living and lead to an increase in poverty.\" \n\nEven though Mackey's bank account consists of millions of dollars, and his company has a market value of $11.7 billion (2011), he lives a modest life, driving a five-year-old Honda Civic, renting the cheapest hotels and always flying commercial.\nAt business meetings he wears khaki shorts, a checked shirt and old running shoes.\n\nDuring his twenties, he experimented with different religions and philosophies. A girl influenced him to become a Christian for a short while. Now he recognizes himself as a perennialist, also called the Perennial philosophy. A perennialist is a person that believes a universal truth lies beneath everything.\n\nMackey had a longtime relationship with Mary Kay Hagen.\n\nHe married his current wife, Deborah Morin, in 1991. They have no children. Both practice yoga. They spend the week in Austin and weekends at their ranch west of Austin.\n\nMackey was named the 2003 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year, and one of the top 30 CEOs in 2007 by \"Barron's\" magazine. In May 2008, he received an honorary bachelor's degree from Bentley College.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1851664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851664", "title": "The Union (Italy)", "text": "The Union (Italy)\n\nThe Union () was an heterogenous centre-left political and electoral alliance of political parties in Italy. The Union was the direct heir of The Olive Tree coalition which represented the centre-left in the 1996 and 2001 general elections. However, The Union also included parties of the radical left, which were not affiliated with The Olive Tree. The Union was led by Romano Prodi, Prime Minister of Italy from April 2006 to April 2008, and former President of the European Commission. Collapsing in the wake of the 2008 Italian political crisis, the alliance was succeeded by the current-day centre-left coalition.\n\nThe parties which were part of the coalition for most of the time are:\n\nDS, DL and MRE contested elections as The Olive Tree federation. The Democratic Party (PD, social-democratic), a merger of DS and DL, replaced its predecessor parties as a member of The Union upon its foundation in October 2007, becoming the largest member party of the alliance. Also during that time, the SDI became the Socialist Party (PS).\n\nAs of 2005, the coalition was assumed to be led by Prodi, however he called for a primary election in order to gain an official leadership. Primary elections were a novelty in Italian politics, as the proportional system in place until the early 1990s was supposed to present sufficient variety to electors. With the new majoritarian electoral system, two clear blocks emerged since 1996. The primary elections for The Union took place on 16 October 2005.\n\nPrimary elections had never been held on a national level before in Italy, and only once at a regional level, in Apulia: in that occasion, Nichi Vendola, a communist and gay Catholic, became the candidate for the centre-left coalition in a region reputed to be conservative and with deep religious roots. The institute of primary election came under criticism from some centre-left moderates, as in their opinion it had produced a useless candidate doomed to failure. However, Vendola's victory against the incumbent governor and centre-right candidate Raffaele Fitto, a much more conventional and moderate young man, vindicated the primary elections in the internal argumentations of The Union.\n\nWhen the primary elections were first proposed, they were mostly meant as a plebiscite for Romano Prodi, since there were no other candidates to the leadership of the coalition. The secretary of the Communist Refoundation Party, Fausto Bertinotti, then announced he would run for the leadership, even if only to act as a symbolic candidate, to avoid a one-candidate election. After some time, more candidates were presented.\n\nThe seven candidates for the leadership of The Union were, in the order in which they appear on the electoral ballot: \n\nThe primary election may have been foreseen an easy win for Romano Prodi, with the other candidates running mostly to \"measure their strengths\" in the coalition, and they often talked about reaching a certain percentage rather than winning. However, there were rumours of supporters of the House of Freedoms trying to participate in the elections, and vote in favour of Mastella, reputed to be the least competent of the candidates and the least likely to win against Berlusconi, other than the most centrist; other rumours indicated such \"fake\" left-wing voters would vote for Bertinotti, because his leadership would likely lose any grip on the political centre.\n\nThe primary election had been held nationwide on 16 October 2005, from 8 am to 10 pm. The primary election was open to all Italian citizens who were at least 18 during the following general election, plus regular immigrants who have lived in Italy for three years (immigrants still do not have the opportunity to vote for any other election in Italy), against a payment of (at least) 1 euro, charged to cover organisational expenses. Poll stations were mainly managed on a voluntary basis; they were hosted mainly in squares, local party quarters, schools, and even restaurants, bars, campers and a hairdresser; some polling stations were also provided outside the country for Italians abroad. Most of the party leaders claimed a result of 1 million voters would be a good success for the election. The total count was in excess of 4,300,000.\n\nClemente Mastella claimed, already on the election day, that too few ballots had been provided in areas where his party is stronger, and that several pre-marked voting papers, pre-marked with votes for Prodi, have been prepared in order to let him lose. No one other than Mastella backed up these claims inside the coalition, and material evidence was not presented.\n\nFrancesco Fortugno, vice-president of the Council of Calabria and member of The Daisy (DL), was murdered on 16 October 2005 by two killers when he was waiting in line to vote in a polling station in Locri. The act was assumed to have political significance since the murderers killed him on a political occasion and with dozens of witnesses. The administration Fortugno was a part of had previously removed many administrators, and some saw this murder as an act of retribution from the 'Ndrangheta against Agazio Loiero's administration.\n\n5\"9,816 poll stations\"\nMost reactions on the centre-left were comprehensibly enthusiastic, especially because of the high number of participants. Clemente Mastella, however, accused the organization of rigging the election and having pre-printed ballots in favour of Prodi.\n\nOn the centre-right, two main attitudes were held: some respected or even hailed the election, others contested its validity and characterised them as propaganda. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1851672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851672", "title": "Ilha da Queimada Grande", "text": "Ilha da Queimada Grande\n\nIlha da Queimada Grande, also known as Snake Island, is an island off the coast of Brazil in the Atlantic Ocean. It is administered as part of the municipality of Itanhaém in the State of São Paulo. The island is small in size, only , and has a temperate climate. The island's terrain varies considerably, ranging from bare rock to rainforest. It is the only home of the critically endangered, venomous \"Bothrops insularis\" (golden lancehead pit viper), which has a diet of birds. The snakes became trapped on the island when rising sea levels covered up the land that connected it to the mainland. The ensuing selection pressure allowed the snakes to adapt to their new environment, increasing rapidly in population and rendering the island dangerous to public visitation. Queimada Grande is closed to the public in order to protect both people and the snake population; access is only available to the Brazilian Navy and selected researchers vetted by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation, the Brazilian federal conservation unit.\n\nLocated approximately off the coast of the state of São Paulo, Brazil, the island is approximately in area. The island ranges in elevation from sea level to above sea level. The island has a temperate climate that is similar to its neighbouring island Nimer. of the island is covered by rain forest; the remaining areas consist of barren rocks and open grassland. Queimada Grande ranges from an average of in August to in March, and rainfall ranges from per month in July to in December.\n\nIlha da Queimada Grande has a variety of vegetation. The island is partly covered in rainforest and partly bare rock and grassy cleared areas, a result of deforestation. The deforestation is the origin of the island's name: the term \"Queimada\", in Portuguese, means “burnt” because when locals attempted to clear land for a banana plantation on the island, they had to clear rain forest using this technique. A lighthouse was constructed in 1909 to steer ships away from the island. The last human inhabitants left the island when the lighthouse was automated. \n\nThe island and the Ilha Queimada Pequena to the west are protected by the Ilhas Queimada Pequena e Queimada Grande Area of Relevant Ecological Interest, created in 1985.\nThe Brazilian Navy has closed the island to the public and the only people who are allowed on the island are research teams who receive waivers to collect data.\n\nBecause there are so many snakes on one island, by some estimates one snake to every square meter (10.8 square feet) of the island, there is competition for resources. Despite a population of 41 recorded bird species on Queimada Grande, the \"golden lancehead\" relies on only two: the \"Troglodytes musculus\" (the southern house wren), which is usually able to avoid the golden lancehead as a predator, and the \"Chilean elaenia\" (a species of flycatcher), which feeds on vegetation in the same area as the snake. The island was thought to have a population of about 430,000 snakes, but recent estimates are much lower. The first systematic study of the population of the golden lancehead found the population to be 2,000 to 4,000, concentrated almost entirely in the rainforest area of the island. This might have happened because there was a limited amount of resources and the population became level, but in 2015 an estimate by a herpetologist on a Discovery Channel documentary stated that the population remains at 2,000 to 4,000 golden lanceheads. The \"Bothrops insularis\" also may be at risk from inbreeding, effects of which are evident in the population. Because of the overall low population of the golden lancehead, the snake was labelled critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It also was placed on the list of Brazil's endangered animals. The island is also home to a smaller population of \"Dipsas albifrons\", a non-venomous snake species.\n\n\n"}

It was released on September 16, 1997 by LaFace Records, in North America. The album features guest appearances from Monica, Jermaine Dupri, and Lil' Kim. The album was supported by three singles, all platinum-selling: \"Nice & Slow\", \"My Way\", and \"You Make Me Wanna...\".\n\nWith most of the album production by Babyface and Dupri, the album debuted at number 15 on \"Billboard\" 200 and number four on US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. The album eventually topped the \"Billboard\" R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart for 3 weeks and it also peaked at number four on the \"Billboard\" 200 and became a commercial success. It was certified six times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). \"My Way\" earned Usher a nomination for Grammy-nominations and became his breakthrough album.\n\nIn a contemporary review, \"The Source\" magazine said with \"My Way\", \"Usher proves that he's aiming to become more than just R&B music's best kept secret\". Asondra R. Hunter from \"Vibe\" said that Usher is sensual through his mild and gentle tone and tasteful, refined lyrics. Robert Christgau, writing in \"The Village Voice\", cited \"Just Like Me\" and \"You Make We Wanna...\" as highlights, and quipped that Usher was \"the sweetest nonvirgin a mama could ask\". He gave \"My Way\" a one-star honorable mention, indicating \"a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like.\" In a negative review for \"Rolling Stone\", David Fricke felt that the album has too many downtempo songs, and criticised the writing and production quality.\n\nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave \"My Way\" four out of five stars and praised Usher's vocal restraint, but noted inconsistency in quality. In a 2002 review, \"Q\" magazine also gave it four stars and wrote that it established Usher's reputation as a young and skillful performer of R&B slow jams. Keith Harris, writing in \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" (2004), gave it three-and-a-half stars and said that, although Dupri's combination of hi-hat hits, acoustic-guitar arpeggios, and occasional guest raps from him and Lil Kim can inhibit the album, \"My Way\" was the work of a significant, enterprising artist. Yahoo! Music's Billy Johnson Jr. credited the album for Usher's breakthrough into the music industry, and lauded the production of the three singles.\n\n\"My Way\" debuted at number 15 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart dated October 4, 1997, selling 66,000 copies in its first week in the United States. It entered the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums at number four on that same week. The album rose to number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums on January 10, 1998; it topped the chart for three consecutive weeks, and remained on the chart for a total of seventy-five weeks. \"My Way\" peaked at number four on the \"Billboard\" 200, and spent seventy-nine weeks on that chart. It has since been certified six times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over six million copies in the United States. It has sold six million copies in the United States and seven million copies worldwide.\n\n\nCredits are adapted from Allmusic and album's liner notes.\n"}

{"id": "1851692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851692", "title": "Bergen County Academies", "text": "Bergen County Academies\n\nThe Bergen County Academies (BCA), commonly referred to as Bergen Academies or as the Academies due to its seven academic and professional divisions, is a tuition-free public magnet high school located in Hackensack, New Jersey that serves students in the ninth through twelfth grades from Bergen County, New Jersey.\n\nFounded in 1991, BCA was named as one of the 23 highest performing high schools in the United States by \"The Washington Post\". BCA is a National Blue Ribbon School, a member of the National Consortium of Secondary STEM Schools, home of eleven 2020 Regeneron Science Talent Search Scholars including two Finalists, and a Model School in the Arts as named by the New Jersey Department of Education.\n\nAs of the 2017–18 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,098 students and 93.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.8:1. There were 33 students (3.0% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 17 (1.5% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.\n\nAdmission to BCA is highly selective, as the school typically accepts about 15% of students who apply each year through a process that includes middle school transcripts, letters of recommendation, an entrance test, and an interview by a panel of faculty. The school's strengths are its academics, extracurricular activities, and notable faculty. While offering some 14 AP courses, BCA does not focus on them. Led by a faculty of which 20% hold PhDs, students at BCA enjoy courses that often surpass AP courses in technical rigor and creativity. \n\nFor the Class of 2020, the average SAT was 1492 and the average ACT was 33. The only colleges or universities in the United States with higher average SAT scores than BCA, given the numbers released by US News in 2019, are MIT and Cal Tech. The average SAT score at BCA is higher than those of The University of Chicago, Harvey Mudd, WUSTL, Johns Hopkins, Harvard, Columbia, Carnegie Mellon, and Vanderbilt.\n\nIn 2015, Bergen County Academies was one of 15 schools in New Jersey, and one of 9 public schools, to be recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School in the exemplary high performing category by the United States Department of Education. In the same year, \"Newsweek\" ranked BCA 5th out of the top 500 public schools in America in 2015 and 4th in New Jersey.\n\n\"Inside Jersey\" magazine ranked BCA 1st in its 2014 ranking of New Jersey's Top Performing High Schools. In the same year, \"The Daily Beast\" ranked BCA 15th in the nation among over 700 magnet and charter schools, 2nd among the 25 Best High Schools in the Northeast, and 1st among schools in New Jersey. \"The Washington Post\" designated BCA as one of 23 top-performing schools with elite students intentionally excluded from its list of America's Most Challenging High Schools \"because, despite their exceptional quality, their admission rules and standardized test scores indicate they have few or no average students.\"\n\nBCA is divided into seven academic and professional divisions which are often referred to by their single-word nicknames or acronyms. However, BCA is treated as a single high school within the district and the state. BCA has an extended school day from 8:00 AM to 4:10 PM. The day starts with a 4-minute Information Gathering Session (IGS) followed by 27 modules (commonly referred to as \"mods\") that last 15 minutes each.\n\nThere are 18 academic departments at BCA: Biology, Business, Chemistry, Culinary Arts, Engineering, English, Health/PE, History, Journalism, Mathematics, Music, Physics, Studio Arts and Graphic Communications, Technology, Theater Arts, Senior Experience, Visual Arts, and World Languages. All academies require four years of English Language, mathematics, social studies, and physical education, as well as three years of science and world language. All students take three years of projects and clubs, with clubs placed at the last three mods on Wednesday. Seniors participate in Senior Experience, an internship program through which seniors work and learn for the full business day each Wednesday instead of reporting to school. In addition, 40 hours of community service are required for graduation.\n\nWhile offering some 14 AP courses, BCA does not emphasize them. BCA gives its teachers great freedom in curriculum design to adequately engage the intellectual capacity of the student body. Thus, courses often surpass AP courses in technical rigor and creativity. Such courses include Series Hybrids and Electric Vehicles, Civil Engineering and Architecture, Cybersecurity, Digital Electronics, Optics and Lasers, Modern Optical Physics, Advanced Problems in Music Theory, Comparative Asian Cultures, Microscopy, Forensic Science, Foundations of Nanotechnology, Interactive Design, Stagecraft, Medical Microbiology, Bioengineering, Markets & Trading, Zoology, Acting Methods, Bioethics, Anatomy and Physiology, Organic Chemistry, Macroeconomics and International Economics, Advanced Business Topics, Entrepreneurship, and Culinology.\n\nResearch is available to students in all academies: the independent research opportunities offered allow students to compete in science fairs on local to international levels as well as submit papers for publication.\n\nStudents of all academies participate in various studio and performing arts courses. The BCA Concert and Chamber Choirs have won excellent ratings and awards at local and national competitions under Dr. Patrick D. Finley. The instrumental performance program has offered other features, including an opportunity for students to play with the North Jersey Philharmonic, Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and the New Jersey Guitar & Music Society. The music program was founded by BCA's current music director, Michael Lemma. The school features two studio art labs, one of which is a visual arts lab with compositing and printing equipment that trains students in graphic communication and print media. The theatre department puts on plays and musicals each year.\n\nAAST was founded on a charter school framework in 1992 with the mission of preparing students for careers in math and science by promoting a problem-solving, project-based, technical learning environment. AAST has departed from this model and has since adopted a more standard college-preparatory curriculum. The roots of the program can be seen in its unique science curriculum, which emphasizes and integrates chemistry, biology, and physics, as well as its hallmark Wednesday lab rotation for the first two years. Much of the AAST model, including the 6-mod project period on Wednesday, has been adopted by the other academies.\n\nABF is the only academy in which most students participate in the full IB Diploma Programme. Students in ABF take courses in economics, marketing, management, business law, management information systems, and business ethics. BCA was certified to offer the IB Diploma Programme in January 2004 and is one of only 17 schools in New Jersey to offer the IB program at the high school level.\n\nFounded in 1997 and originally called the Academy for Culinary Arts (ACA), ACAHA represents a culinary vocational program that was reworked to give students a more academic focus. Originally grouped with APT and AVAGC as \"career\" academies, ACAHA was set apart from the college prep programs of AAST, ABF, AEDT and AMST. After being reorganized into the academic, college-prep academies, the name changed to the present name in 2002 to reflect the new curriculum. Head instructor Mary Beth Brace has been recognized as Advisor of the Year for SkillsUSA and has received attention for her devotion as a baking and culinary arts instructor. Chef John Branda, who worked in the food service industry for 30 years, was the saucier at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and co-owner of an upscale Fair Lawn, New Jersey restaurant.\n\nThis academy's core curriculum is similar to that of AAST, but provides more room for courses in electronics and design. The program encourages students to take part in competitions such as \"BattleBots IQ.\" Students in AEDT take courses such as Digital Electronics, Principles of Engineering, Introduction to Engineering Design, and Electrical Engineering.\n\nStudents in AMST have more required biology courses than other academies, which include Medical Science Seminar, Biotechnology Lab, Advanced Topics in Medicine, and Anatomy and Physiology. AMST is mainly for students who are more interested in pursuing a career in the medical field and have common interests in all sciences. Students in AMST will be given chances to use state-of-the-art laboratories and equipment to conduct experiments relating to medicine. AMST focuses more on biology and chemistry than other academies, and places students on the path towards pursuing a career in the medical field which requires all the basic knowledge and skills taught throughout the courses in this academy.\n\nATCS has a focus on the world of computers and the Internet. Its students are well-prepared for careers such as computer programming, software engineering, and other computer- and engineering-related professions. The updated curriculum focuses on software development with Python and Java, and introduces students to computational theory. However, students also have the opportunity to take courses in C, Assembly, Web Development, and more. ATCS is the progenitor of hackBCA, the first ever high school hackathon, drawing major corporate sponsorship and hundreds of high school students to the school in a 24-hour hacking event.\n\nAVPA is unique for being subdivided into three divisions: Visual, which focuses on combining skill and passion into one cohesive movement; Music, which requires students to take AP music theory and digital music classes, as well as master a focused voice/instrument; and Theatre, which stages all plays at the school and has resources similar to and sometimes better than Broadway plays. Depending on their focus, students in AVPA take classes in drawing, painting, and printing, acting and stagecraft, music theory, digital recording, musicianship and present a formal Senior Recital.\n\nBCA has a successful Model United Nations team that runs its own Model UN conference. The BCA Model UN team has won Best Delegation at numerous conferences, including those hosted by Yale University, Princeton University, the George Washington University, and New York University. The BCA Model UN team has also earned many individual delegate awards.\n\nBCA's debate team competes in both the varsity and junior varsity levels of debate. BCA's policy debate program finished first in Bergen County in 2005–2006, beating Tenafly High School and the Dwight-Englewood School.\n\nBCA's Mock Trial team was undefeated for part of the 2011–2012 season and runs frequent practices to prepare for each trial.\n\nBCA hosts an accomplished Junior State of America (JSA) chapter. It won Chapter of the Year for the Mid-Atlantic State in the 2011–2012, 2014–2015, 2016–2017, and 2018–2019 school years, and was home to the Mid-Atlantic Statespersons of the Year in 2014–2015 and 2016–2017. It meets as a Wednesday club and also attends and hosts JSA conventions.\n\nThe Math Team is open to all academies, but is known as \"AMST Math Team\" for historical and logistical reasons.\n\nWith over 150 students from grades 12 and below in participation, Math Team is the largest extracurricular team at the Academies. The late Joseph Holbrook, chair of the math department, was the team's coach from its founding until his January 2010 death. In line with the school's original philosophy, Holbrook created a model for mathematics education that was directed at solving non-standard problems, without concerning traditional time restraints and curricula. Students are encouraged to come to practices and participate with the team in high school math competitions such as the AMCs, AIME, USAMO, Mandelbrot, Harvard–MIT Mathematics Tournament, and ARML. The team often ranks within the top ten in competitions it enters, competing against other top magnet schools as well as teams representing entire states and regions.\n\nIn 2008, the team won first place in Division B at the Princeton University Mathematics Competition, an annual competition attended routinely by the team. The school routinely has 10+ students qualifying for the USAMO (United States of America Mathematical Olympiad), with a student winning the competition in 2012. The school captured first place at the 2009 ARML Local competition, another routine annual competition. In 2015, student Ryan Alweiss competed on the American team at the International Math Olympiad, helping the US win the competition for the first time since 1994 with a 98th percentile score of 31.\n\nBCA's junior varsity and varsity quiz bowl teams qualified to compete in the National History Bowl in 2013, and several individuals competed in the National History Bee.\n\nBCA's BattleBots IQ team, known as the Titanium Knights, won the 2006 national heavyweight championship in the high school division with the robot \"E2V2\", and won two other awards for another 120-pound robot, \"Knightrous\". In previous years, the team has won second, third, and fourth place titles in BBIQ, and affiliated student teams have won numerous awards in Northeast Robotics Club events.\n\nBCA is home to a large Amnesty International student group that leads schoolwide events and attends local, regional, and national conferences on human rights.\n\nBCA students participate in many other competitions nationwide, such as DECA, SkillsUSA, FBLA-PBL, and Health Occupations Students of America.\n\nBCA shares its sports program with the Bergen County Technical Schools in Teterboro and Paramus. The boys' teams, called the Bergen Tech Knights, and the girls' teams, the Bergen Tech Lady Knights, compete in the Big North Conference, following a reorganization of the Northern New Jersey sports leagues by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association. In the 2009–2010 school year, the school competed in the North Jersey Tri-County Conference, which was established on an interim basis to facilitate the realignment. Before the realignment, Bergen Tech had been placed in the Northern New Jersey Interscholastic League (NNJIL) at the start of the Fall 2006 athletic season. With 1,605 students in grades 10–12, Bergen Tech is classified by the NJSIAA for most sports as North I Group IV for athletic competition purposes.\n\nNumerous sports are offered for boys and girls, including basketball, bowling, golf, lacrosse, soccer, track, tennis, and volleyball. For boys, offerings also include football. As of the 2008–2009 school year, wrestling was discontinued. During the 2007–2008 school year, a varsity fencing team was initiated by parents along with the Athletic Department.\n\nAthletic achievements for the Bergen Tech Knights and Bergen Tech Lady Knights include:\n\nThe Bergen County Academies is located on the John Grieco Campus of the Bergen County Technical Schools District in Hackensack. The school occupies a sprawling main building which runs along Hackensack Avenue as well as a nearby Environmental Science Center (ESC) building.\n\nA dedicated Bloomberg workstation lets students conduct independent financial markets analysis and research. The option to earn a Bloomberg Certification is also available through tutorials. BCA is one of the few high schools in the country to have access to this technology.\n\nFirst opened in May 2008, the Nanotechnology Lab offers one scanning electron microscope and one transmission electron microscope to experienced faculty and students, especially those conducting research in the natural sciences.\n\nThe stem cell research laboratories are foundational to BCA's research program, which enables students to work as scientists.\n\nThe school features two studio art labs. One of the studios is a visual arts lab equipped with compositing and printing equipment to train students in graphic communication and print media.\n\nThe school has a restaurant-grade kitchen for teaching culinary arts. The Academy Grill serves as a laboratory for those taking culinary arts or hospitality administration classes.\n\nThe Video Lab broadcasts inside the school, featuring workstations, professional cameras, and a bluescreen.\n\nThe theatre arts and music departments produces plays, concerts, and musicals each year in an auditorium adjoining the main building that seats 1,200. It is regularly rented to outside professional groups.\n\nThe school's baseball field, football field, track, and parking for students and visitors are located behind the academic buildings.\n\nThe school is considered the brainchild of John Grieco and began as a single academy, \"The Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology\" (AAST), which shared the current campus with the Bergen County Technical High School now located in Teterboro. The first group of AAST students was inducted in 1992 for the graduating class of 1996.\n\nIn 1997, additional academies opened on the campus: the Academy for Business and Computer Technology (ABCT), the Academy for Engineering and Design Technology (AEDT), and the Academy for Medical Science Technology (AMST). The following year saw the opening of three career institutes, renamed a year later to become academies: the Academy for Culinary Arts (ACA), the Academy for Power and Transportation (APT), and the Academy for Visual Arts and Graphic Communications (AVAGC). Soon, all seven programs began focusing on college preparation, adopting a liberal arts curriculum with a focus on their respective fields.\n\nIn 2001, a dispute initiated by the Bergen County School Administrators' Association focused on what Paramus Superintendent Janice Dime called \"elitism.\" Several sending districts threatened to withdraw funding from the school. In response, the Bergen County Technical Schools agreed to increase the transparency of the admissions process and enter into talks with a number of sending districts.\n\nIn 2002, APT was eliminated. ABCT was split into the Academy for Business and Finance (ABF) and the Academy for Technology and Computer Science (ATCS). ACA added hotel administration to its coursework and became the Academy for Culinary Arts and Hospitality Administration (ACAHA). AVAGC expanded its scope to include performing arts and became the Academy for Visual and Performing Arts (AVPA). The school itself also changed its name numerous times, from \"Bergen County Regional Academies\" to \"Bergen Academies\" to \"Bergen County Academy\" and to the present \"Bergen County Academies.\"\n\n\n"}

It is based on David Guterson's novel of the same name. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography.\n\nSet on the fictional San Piedro Island in the northern Puget Sound region of the Washington state coast in 1950, the plot revolves around the murder case of Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), a Japanese American accused of killing Carl Heine, a White fisherman. The trial occurs in the midst of deep anti-Japanese sentiments following World War II. Covering the case is the editor of the town's one-man newspaper, Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke), a World War II veteran who lost an arm fighting the Japanese in the Pacific War. Ishmael struggles with his childhood, and continuing, love for Kazuo's wife, Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), and his conscience, wondering if Kazuo is truly innocent.\n\nSpearheading the prosecution are the town's sheriff, Art Moran (Richard Jenkins), and prosecutor, Alvin Hooks (James Rebhorn). Leading the defense is the old, experienced attorney Nels Gudmundsson (Max von Sydow). An underlying theme throughout the trial is prejudice. Several witnesses, including Etta Heine (Celia Weston), Carl's mother, accuse Kazuo of murdering Carl for racial and personal reasons. This stance is not without irony, as Kazuo (a decorated war veteran of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team), experienced prejudice because of his ancestry, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. By the same standard, Etta, a German American, could be blamed for Nazi war crimes.\n\nAlso involved in the trial is Ole Jurgensen, an elderly man who sold his strawberry field to Carl. The strawberry field is a contested issue during the trial. The land was originally owned by Carl Heine Sr. The Miyamotos lived in a house on the Heines' land and picked strawberries for Carl Sr. Kazuo and Carl Jr. were close friends as children. Kazuo's father, Zenhichi, eventually approached Carl Sr. about purchasing of the farm. Though Etta opposed the sale, Carl Sr. agreed. The payments were to be made over a ten-year period. However, before the last payment was made, war erupted between the U.S. and Japan, and all islanders of Japanese ancestry were forced to relocate to internment camps. In 1944, Carl Sr. died and Etta sold the land to Ole. When Kazuo returned after the war, he was extremely bitter toward Etta for reneging on the land sale. When Ole suffered a stroke and decided to sell the farm, he was approached by Carl Jr., hours before Kazuo arrived, to try to buy the land back. During the trial, the land is presented as a family feud and the motivation behind Carl's murder.\n\nIshmael's search of the maritime records reveals on the night that Carl Heine died a freighter had passed through the channel where Carl had been fishing at 1:42am, five minutes before his watch had stopped. Ishmael realizes that Carl was thrown overboard by the force of the freighter's wake. Despite the bitterness he feels at Hatsue's rejection, Ishmael comes forward with the new information. Further evidence is collected in support of the conclusion that Carl had climbed the boat's mast to cut down a lantern, been knocked from the mast by the freighter's wake, hit his head, then fallen into the sea. The charges against Kazuo are dismissed. Hatsue thanks Ishmael by allowing him to hold her \"one last time.\"\n\nScenes of Maine's Portland Head Light were filmed during the ice storm of 1998.\n\n\n\n\"Snow Falling on Cedars\" received an approval rating of 39% on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 92 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 5.26/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Though \"Snow Falling on Cedars\" is beautiful to look at, critics say the story becomes dull and tedious to sit through.\" \"Snow Falling on Cedars\" also received \"mixed or average\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" awarded the film 3 1/2 out of 4 stars and wrote that \"\"Snow Falling on Cedars\" is a rich, multilayered film about a high school romance and a murder trial a decade later\" and that it \"reveals itself with the complexity of a novel, holding its themes up to the light so that first one and then another aspect can be seen.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1851712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851712", "title": "Film adaptation", "text": "Film adaptation\n\nA film adaptation is the transfer of a work or story, in whole or in part, to a feature film. Although often considered a type of derivative work, film adaptation has been conceptualized recently by academic scholars such as Robert Stam as a dialogic process.\n\nA common form of film adaptation is the use of a novel as the basis of a feature film. Other works adapted into films include non-fiction (including journalism), autobiography, comic books, scriptures, plays, historical sources and other films. From the earliest days of cinema, in nineteenth-century Europe, adaptation from such diverse resources has been a ubiquitous practice of filmmaking.\n\nIn 1924, Erich von Stroheim attempted a literal adaptation of Frank Norris's novel \"McTeague\" with his film \"Greed\" and the resulting film was 9½ hours long. It was cut, at studio insistence, to four hours, then without Stroheim's input, cut again to around two hours. The end result was a film that was largely incoherent. Since that time, few directors have attempted to put everything in a novel into a film. Therefore, elision is all but essential.\n\nIn some cases, film adaptations also interpolate scenes or invent characters. This is especially true when a novel is part of a literary saga. Incidents or quotations from later or earlier novels will be inserted into a single film. Additionally and far more controversially, filmmakers will invent new characters or create stories that were not present in the source material at all. Given the anticipated audience for a film, the screenwriter, director or movie studio may wish to increase character time or to invent new characters. For example, William J. Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"Ironweed\" included a short appearance by a prostitute named Helen. Because the film studio anticipated a female audience for the film and had Meryl Streep for the role, Helen became a significant part of the film. However, characters are also sometimes invented to provide the narrative voice.\n\nThere have been several notable cases of massive inventive adaptation, including the Roland Joffe adaptation of \"The Scarlet Letter\" with explicit sex between Hester Prynn and the minister and Native American obscene puns into a major character and the film's villain. The Charlie Kaufman and \"Donald Kaufman\" penned \"Adaptation\", credited as an adaptation of the novel \"The Orchid Thief\", was an intentional satire and commentary on the process of film adaptation itself. All of those are cases of Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. The creators of the \"Gulliver's Travels\" miniseries interpolated a sanity trial to reflect the ongoing scholarly debate over whether or not Gulliver himself is sane at the conclusion of Book IV. In those cases, adaptation is a form of criticism and recreation as well as translation.\n\nChange is essential and practically unavoidable, mandated both by the constraints of time and medium, but how much is always a balance. Some film theorists have argued that a director should be entirely unconcerned with the source, as a novel is a novel and a film is a film, and the two works of art must be seen as separate entities. Since a transcription of a novel into film is impossible, even holding up a goal of \"accuracy\" is absurd. Others argue that what a film adaptation does is change to fit (literally, adapt), and the film must be accurate to the effect (aesthetics), the theme, or the message of a novel and that the filmmaker must introduce changes, if necessary, to fit the demands of time and to maximize faithfulness along one of those axes.\n\nIn most cases adaptation, the films are required to create identities (for example, a characters' costume or set decor) since they are not specified in the original material. Then, the influence of film-makers may go unrecognized because there is no comparison in the original material even though the new visual identities will affect narrative interpretation. Peter Jackson's adaptations of \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy and \"The Hobbit\" by author JRR Tolkien represent an unusual case since many visual and stylistic details were specified by Tolkien. For the \"Harry Potter\" film series, author JK Rowling was closely consulted by the filmmakers, and she provided production designer Stuart Craig with a map of Hogwarts' grounds and also prevented director Alfonso Cuarón from adding a graveyard scene because the graveyard would appear elsewhere in a later novel.\n\nAn often overlooked aspect of film adaptation is the inclusion of sound and music. In a literary text, a specific sound effect can often be implied or specified by an event, but in the process of adaptation, filmmakers must determine specific the sound characteristics that subliminally affects narrative interpretation. In some cases of adaptation, music may have been specified in the original material (usually diegetic music). In Stephenie Meyer's 2005 \"Twilight\" novel, the characters Edward Cullen and Bella Swan both listen to Debussy's \"Clair de lune\" and Edward composes the piece \"Bella's Lullaby\" for Bella. While \"Clair de lune\" was a pre-existing piece of music, \"Bella's Lullaby\" was not and required original music to be composed for the 2008 movie adaptation.\n\nIn the 2016 sci-fi film \"\" adapted from the story by Kurt Vonnegut, the film-makers decided to abandon Vonnegut's choice of music. They stated that they felt that it worked in his prose only because it was not actually heard. Filmmakers' test screenings found that Vonnegut's style of music confused audiences and detracted from narrative comprehension. The film's composer, Leon Coward, stated, \"You can try to be as true to Vonnegut's material as possible, but at the end of the day also you’re working with the material that you as a team have generated, not just Vonnegut's, and that’s what you've got to make work.\"\n\nStage plays are frequent sources for film adaptations. \n\nMany of William Shakespeare's plays, including \"Hamlet\", \"Romeo and Juliet\", and \"Othello\", have been adapted into films. The first sound adaptation of any Shakespeare play was the 1929 production of \"The Taming of the Shrew\", starring Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. It was later adapted as both a musical play called \"Kiss Me, Kate\", which opened on Broadway in 1948, and as the 1953 Hollywood musical of the same name. \"The Taming of the Shrew\" was again retold in 1999 as a teen comedy set in a high school in \"10 Things I Hate about You\", and also in 2003 as an urban romantic comedy, \"Deliver Us from Eva\". The 1961 musical film \"West Side Story\" was adapted from \"Romeo and Juliet\", with its first incarnation as a Broadway musical play that opened in 1957. The animated film \"The Lion King\" (1994) was inspired by \"Hamlet\" as well as various traditional African myths, and 2001's \" O\" was based on \"Othello\".\n\nFilm adaptations of Shakespeare's works in languages other than English are numerous, including Akira Kurosawa's films \"Throne of Blood\" (1957, an epic film version of \"Macbeth\"), \" The Bad Sleep Well\" (1960, inspired by \"Hamlet\") and \"Ran\" (1985, based on \"King Lear\"); and Vishal Bhardwaj's \"Shakespearean trilogy\" consisting of \" Haider\" (2014, a retelling of \"Hamlet\"), \"Omkara\" (2006, based on \"Othello\") and \"Maqbool\" (2003, based on \"Macbeth\"). \n\nAnother way in which Shakespearean texts have been incorporated in films is to feature characters who are either actors performing those texts or characters who are somehow influenced or effected by seeing one of Shakespeare's plays, within a larger non-Shakespearean story. Generally, Shakespeare's basic themes or certain elements of the plot will parallel the main plot of the film or become part of a character's development in some way. Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet are the two plays which have most often been used in this way. Éric Rohmer's 1992 film \"Conte d'hiver\" (\"A Tale of Winter\") is one example. Rohmer uses one scene from Shakepeare's \"A Winter's Tale\" as a major plot device within a story that is not based on the play at all.\n\nIn Britain, where stage plays tend to be more popular as a form of entertainment than currently in the United States, many films began as a stage productions. Some British films and British/American collaborations that were based on successful British plays include \"Gaslight\" (1940), \"Blithe Spirit\" (1945), \"Rope\" (1948), \"Look Back in Anger\" (1959), \"Oh, What a Lovely War!\" (1969), \"Sleuth\" (1972), \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" (1975), \"Shirley Valentine\" (1989), \"The Madness of King George\" (1994), \"The History Boys\" (2006), \" Quartet\" (2012), and \"The Lady in the Van\" (2015).\n\nSimilarly, hit Broadway plays are often adapted into films, whether from musicals or dramas. Some examples of American film adaptations based on successful Broadway plays are \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" (1944), \"Born Yesterday\" (1950), \"Harvey\" (1950), \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), \"The Odd Couple\" (1968), \"The Boys in the Band\" (1970), \"Agnes of God\" (1985), \"Children of a Lesser God\" (1986), Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), \"Real Women Have Curves\" (2002), \"Rabbit Hole\" (2010), and \"Fences\" (2016).\n\nOn one hand, theatrical adaptation does not involve as many interpolations or elisions as novel adaptation, but on the other, the demands of scenery and possibilities of motion frequently entail changes from one medium to the other. Film critics will often mention if an adapted play has a static camera or emulates a proscenium arch. Laurence Olivier consciously imitated the arch with his \"Henry V\" (1944), having the camera begin to move and to use color stock after the prologue, indicating the passage from physical to imaginative space. Sometimes, the adaptive process can continue after one translation. Mel Brooks' \"The Producers\" began as a film in 1967, was adapted into a Broadway musical in 2001, and then adapted again in 2005 as a musical film.\n\nFeature films are occasionally created from television series or television segments. In some cases, the film will offer a longer storyline than the usual television program's format and/or expanded production values. During the 1970s, many UK television series were turned into films including \"Dad's Army\", \"On the Buses\", \"Steptoe and Son\" and \"Porridge\". In 1979, \"The Muppet Movie\" was a big success. In the adaptation of \"The X-Files\" to film, greater effects and a longer plotline were involved. Additionally, adaptations of television shows will offer the viewer the opportunity to see the television show's characters without broadcast restrictions. These additions (nudity, profanity, explicit drug use, and explicit violence) are only rarely a featured adaptive addition (film versions of \"procedurals\" such as \"Miami Vice\" are most inclined to such additions as featured adaptations) – \"\" is a notable example of a film being more explicit than its parent TV series.\n\nAt the same time, some theatrically released films are adaptations of television miniseries events. When national film boards and state-controlled television networks co-exist, filmmakers can sometimes create very long films for television that they may adapt solely for time for theatrical release. Both Ingmar Bergman (notably with \"Fanny and Alexander\" but with other films as well) and Lars von Trier have created long television films that they then recut for international distribution.\n\nEven segments of television series have been adapted into feature films. The American television sketch comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\" has been the origin of a number of films, beginning with \"The Blues Brothers\", which began as a one-off performance by Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi.\n\nRadio narratives have also provided the basis of film adaptation. In the heyday of radio, radio segments, like television segments today, translated to film on several occasions, usually as shorts. Radio series turned into film series include \"Dr. Christian\", \"Crime Doctor\" and \"The Whistler\". Dialog-heavy stories and fantastic stories from radio were also adapted to film (e.g. \"Fibber McGee and Molly\" and \"The Life of Riley\"). \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" began as a radio series for the BBC and then became a novel that was adapted to film.\n\nComic book characters, particularly superheroes, have long been adapted into film, beginning in the 1940s with Saturday movie serials aimed at children. \"Superman\" (1978) and \"Batman\" (1989) are two later successful movie adaptations of famous comic book characters. In the early 2000s, blockbusters such as \"X-Men\" (2000) and \"Spider-Man\" (2002) have led to dozens of superhero films. The success of these films has also led to other comic books not necessarily about superheroes being adapted for the big screen, such as \"Ghost World\" (2001), \"From Hell\" (2001), \"American Splendor\" (2003), \"Sin City\" (2005), \"300\" (2007), \"Wanted\" (2008), and \"Whiteout\" (2009).\n\nThe adaptation process for comics is different from that of novels. Many successful comic book series last for several decades and have featured several variations of the characters in that time. Films based on such series usually try to capture the back story and “spirit” of the character instead of adapting a particular storyline. Occasionally, aspects of the characters and their origins are simplified or modernized.\n\nSelf-contained graphic novels, and miniseries many of which do not feature superheroes, can be adapted more directly, such as in the case of \"Road to Perdition\" (2002) or \"V for Vendetta\" (2006). In particular, Robert Rodriguez did not use a screenplay for \"Sin City\" but utilized actual panels from writer/artist Frank Miller's series as storyboards to create what Rodriguez regards as a \"translation\" rather than an adaptation.\n\nFurthermore, some films based on long-running franchises use particular story lines from the franchise as a basis for a plot. The second X-Men film was loosely based on the graphic novel \"\" and the on the storyline \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\". \"Spider-Man 2\" was based on the storyline \"Spider-Man No More!\" Likewise, \"Batman Begins\" owes many of its elements to Miller's \"\" and the film's sequel, \"The Dark Knight\", uses subplots from \"\".\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe starting in 2008 is a shared universe with films combining characters from different works by Marvel Comics. The DC Extended Universe starting in 2013 uses the same model for DC Comics.\n\nThe highest-grossing film is 2019's \"\" and the most profitable comic book film adaptation is \"Joker\" from that same year.\n\nVideo games have also been adapted into films, beginning in the early 1980s. Films closely related to the computer and video game industries were also done in this time, such as \"Tron\" and \"Cloak & Dagger\", but only after the release of several films based on well-known brands has this genre become recognized in its own right. Video game films can take several forms, such as live-action works like \"Super Mario Bros.\", traditionally animated such as films based on the \"Pokémon\", or computer-animated such as \"\". There also exist Original Video Animations (OVAs) based on popular games such as \"\", \"Halo Legends\", \"\" which may be released direct-to-video.\n\nSimilar to comic book-based films in the past (especially from 1980s), films based on video games tend to carry a reputation of lackluster quality and receive negative reaction from both film critics and fans of the source material. This is generally due to difficulties in adopting a story meant to be played interactively into a linear movie-going experience. Some, such as \"Super Mario Bros.\", were particularly negatively received and are considered among the worst films ever made. \"Super Mario Bros.\" was criticized for being too dark, violent and unfaithful (in plot) to the popular video game series.\n\nAnother likely reason for the failure of video game adaptations is that structural conversion from video game to film format can be challenging for filmmakers. Nintendo video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto said in a 2007 interview with \"Edge Magazine\":\nIn an interview with \"Fortune\" in August 2015, Miyamoto said, \"Because games and movies seem like similar mediums, people’s natural expectation is we want to take our games and turn them into movies. … I’ve always felt video games, being an interactive medium, and movies, being a passive medium, mean the two are quite different.\"\n\nUntil 2019, no video game film - live-action or animated - had received a Rotten Tomatoes \"fresh\" rating, with a score over 60%. Three films since, \"Detective Pikachu\", \"The Angry Birds Movie 2\", and \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" have been able to break into the \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Both \"Detective Pikachu\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" have posted better-than-expected domestic takes, with \"Sonic\", as of May 2020 holding the highest domestic opening box-office for a video game film. Its success led to a planned sequel announced in May 2020.\n\nThough video game films are critically panned, they tend to do well from the international take at box offices. \"Warcraft\", based on the \"World of Warcraft\" game, holds the highest take of any video game adaption with , while the six \"Resident Evil\" films hold the highest take for a series of on an average production budget between . Other financially-successful video game films include: \"Mortal Kombat\", \"\", \"Silent Hill\", and \"\". \n\nAmong the most well-known video game filmmakers is Uwe Boll, a German writer, director, and producer whose works include \"House of the Dead\", \"Alone in the Dark\", \"BloodRayne\", \"\", \"Postal\", and \"Far Cry\", all of which were almost universally panned by critics. In 2016, he retired from filmmaking, citing market failures and funding difficulties. Similarly, Paul W.S. Anderson has gained a reputation for his panned video game adaptions, particularly the first \"Mortal Kombat\" film and the \"Resident Evil\" series.\n\nWhile documentary films have often been made from journalism and reportage, so too have some dramatic films, including: \"All the President's Men\" (1976, adapted from the 1974 book); \"Miracle,\" (2004, from an account published shortly after the 1980 \"miracle on ice\"); and \"Pushing Tin\" (1999, from a 1996 \"New York Times\" article by Darcy Frey). \"An Inconvenient Truth\" is Al Gore's film adaptation of his own Keynote multimedia presentation. The 2011 independent comedy film, \"Benjamin Sniddlegrass and the Cauldron of Penguins\" was based on \"Kermode and Mayo's Film Review\" of \"Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief\".\n\nFilms adapted from songs include \"Coward of the County\", \"Ode to Billy Joe\", \"Convoy\", and \"Pretty Baby\" (each from a song of the same name).\n\nFilms based on toys include the Transformers franchise and the G.I. Joe films; there is a longer history of animated television series being created simultaneous to toy lines as a marketing tool. Hasbro's plans to for films based on their board games began with 2012's \"Battleship\". While amusement park rides have often been based on action movies, conversely the 1967 Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland was adapted into \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\" in 2003.\n\nRemakes and film sequels are technically adaptations of the original film. Less direct derivations include \"The Magnificent Seven\" from \"The Seven Samurai\", \"Star Wars\" from \"The Hidden Fortress\", and \"Twelve Monkeys\" from \"La Jetée\".\n\nMany films have been made from mythology and religious texts. Both Greek mythology and the Bible have been adapted frequently. Homer's works have been adapted multiple times in several nations. In these cases, the audience already knows the story well, and so the adaptation will de-emphasize elements of suspense and concentrate instead on detail and phrasing.\n\nMany major film award programs present an award for adapted screenplays, separate from the award for original screenplays. \n\nIn the case of a film which was adapted from an unpublished work, however, different awards have different rules around which category the screenplay qualifies for. In 1983, the Canadian Genie Awards rescinded the Best Adapted Screenplay award they had presented to the film \"Melanie\" when they learned that the original work had been unpublished; and in 2017, the film \"Moonlight\", which was adapted from an unpublished theatrical play, was classified and nominated as an adapted screenplay by some awards but as an original screenplay by others.\n\nWhen a film's screenplay is original, it can also be the source of derivative works such as novels and plays. For example, movie studios will commission novelizations of their popular titles or sell the rights to their titles to publishing houses. These novelized films will frequently be written on assignment and sometimes written by authors who have only an early script as their source. Consequently, novelizations are quite often changed from the films as they appear in theatres.\n\nNovelization can build up characters and incidents for commercial reasons (e.g. to market a card or computer game, to promote the publisher's \"saga\" of novels, or to create continuity between films in a series)\n\nThere have been instances of novelists who have worked from their own screenplays to create novels at nearly the same time as a film. Both Arthur C. Clarke, with \"\", and Graham Greene, with \"The Third Man\", have worked from their own film ideas to a novel form (although the novel version of \"The Third Man\" was written more to aid in the development of the screenplay than for the purposes of being released as a novel). Both John Sayles and Ingmar Bergman write their film ideas as novels before they begin producing them as films, although neither director has allowed these prose treatments to be published.\n\nFinally, films have inspired and been adapted into plays. John Waters's films have been successfully mounted as plays; both \"Hairspray\" and \"Cry-Baby\" have been adapted, and other films have spurred subsequent theatrical adaptations. \"Spamalot\" is a Broadway play based on Monty Python films. In a rare case of a film being adapted from a stage musical adaptation of a film, in 2005, the film adaptation of the stage musical based on Mel Brooks' classic comedy film \"The Producers\" was released.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1851755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851755", "title": "October Sky (book)", "text": "October Sky (book)\n\nOctober Sky is the first memoir in a series of four, by American engineer Homer Hickam Jr. originally published in 1998 as Rocket Boys. Later editions were published under the title \"October Sky\" as a tie-in to the 1999 film adaptation. \n\nIt is a story of growing up in a mining town, and a boy's pursuit of amateur rocketry in a coal mining town. The book won the W.D. Weatherford Award in 1998, the year of its release. Today, it is one of the most often picked community/library reads in the United States. It is also studied in many school systems around the world. \"October Sky\" was followed by \"The Coalwood Way\" (2000), \"Sky of Stone\" (2002), and \"Carrying Albert Home\" (2015).\n\n\"Rocket Boys\" was made into a film in 1999, titled \"October Sky\" (an anagram of \"Rocket Boys\"). The book was then re-published as \"October Sky\" shortly afterwards.\n\nHomer \"Sonny\" Hickam Jr. lives in a small coal mining town in West Virginia named Coalwood. Sonny, after seeing the Russian satellite Sputnik, decides to join the American team of rocket engineers called the Missile Agency when he graduates from school. (Note: In the book \"Rocket Boys\", the main character is always called Sonny. In the movie \"October Sky\", he is called Homer.) Sonny's older brother, Jim Hickam, excels at football and expects to get a college football scholarship. Sonny, however, is terrible at sports and has no special skill that would get him \"out of Coalwood\". Sonny's mother is afraid that he will have to work in the mines after high school. \nSonny's first attempt at rocketry (which occurred when he was 14) consists of a flashlight tube and model airplane body as a casing. It is fueled by flash powder from old cherry bombs. It explodes violently, destroying his mother's fence. After that, Sonny enlists the help of Quentin Wilson, Roy Lee Cooke, Sherman Siers, Jimmy \"O'Dell\" Carroll, and Billy Rose to help build rockets while forming the BCMA (Big Creek Missile Agency). Their first real rocket, powered by black powder, is named Auk 1. This an allusion to the great auk, which is a flightless seabird that became extinct in the mid-19th century. Auk 1 flies six feet before the solder melts, and the nozzle, a washer, separates from the casement. They call themselves \"Rocket Boys\" and call the place where they are launching their rockets \"Cape Coalwood\", in honor of Cape Canaveral. \nThe Rocket Boys enjoy mixed success during their three-year rocket launching campaign (1957 to 1960). They employ several fuel mixtures including rocket candy and a mixture called \"zincoshine\", which is composed of zinc dust and sulfur, along with alcohol from moonshine, supplied by a local bootlegger, as a binder for the mixture. They launch a total of 35 rockets, all sequentially numbered Auk I–XXXI. (There are five different Auk XXIIs.) \nThey also win a National Science Fair gold medal for their rockets, for their project titled \"A Study of Amateur Rocketry Techniques.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1851764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851764", "title": "Wong Jing", "text": "Wong Jing\n\nWong Jing ( born 3 May 1955) is a Hong Kong film director, producer, actor, presenter, and screenwriter. A prolific filmmaker with strong instincts for crowd-pleasing and publicity, Wong Jing has played a prominent role in the Hong Kong cinema of the last quarter-century.\n\nWong was born in Hong Kong, the son of noted film director Wong Tin-Lam. He graduated from the Chinese University of Hong Kong with a degree in Chinese literature which he describes as \"useless\" (Yang, 2003).\n\nLike many Hong Kong film figures of his time, Wong began his career in television – in his case, scriptwriting for local juggernaut TVB beginning in 1975 (Teo, 1997). He moved on to writing for the Shaw Brothers studio. There, he made his directing debut with \"Challenge of the Gamesters\" in 1981. This start foreshadowed his later successes with movies about gambling, such as \"God of Gamblers\", starring Chow Yun-fat and Andy Lau, which broke Hong Kong's all-time box office record upon its release in 1989, and started a fad for the genre.\n\nWong has directed, produced or written over 175 films (Yang, 2003), occasionally acting in them as well. He works with an efficient mass production method making heavy use of directing assistants and allowing him to work on several movies at once. He works under the umbrellas of two production companies he launched, Wong Jing's Workshop Ltd. and BoB and Partners Co. Ltd. (Best of the Best), the latter in partnership with director Andrew Lau and writer-producer Manfred Wong (Bordwell, 2000).\n\nHe once commented that his movies were hits because he gave the people what they wanted, and not what he thought they should want. A typical Wong production might be a broad comedy (\"Boys Are Easy\", 1993) or an entry in a currently popular genre, such as martial arts (\"Holy Weapon\", 1993), erotic thriller (\"Naked Killer\", 1992) or gangster film (\"Young and Dangerous\", 1996). It will imbue its model with lightning pacing and frequent shifts in tone to accommodate slapstick and toilet humor, sentimental heart-tugging, cartoonish violence, sexual titillation, and parodic references to well-known Hong Kong and Hollywood films.\n\nWong also directed or produced several of the films of comic actor Stephen Chow, who has been Hong Kong's most popular performer since the early 1990s. Examples of their collaborations include \"God of Gamblers II\" (1991), \"Tricky Brains\" (1991), \"Royal Tramp I\" and \"II\" (1992) and \"Sixty Million Dollar Man\" (1995).\n\nWong's commercial skills are not limited to the content of his movies or his casting. He was using Hollywood-style cross-media promotional tactics - such as tie-in novels, comic books and other products, and magazine interviews - long before they became common in Hong Kong (Bordwell, 2000).\n\nWong's style, often seen as loud, crass and philistine, may be another factor in his low stock among critics. According to director Ann Hui, he remarked of Hui's acclaimed 1990 drama, \"Song of the Exile\", \"Who wants to watch the autobiography of a fat woman?\" In 1994, unidentified assailants attacked him outside his offices and knocked out his teeth; this was widely believed to have been retaliation for injudicious remarks, ordered by Triads, or Chinese organized crime figures, whose involvement in the industry is notorious. (Dannen and Long, 1997), although Wong himself is rumored to be related with the Triads.\n\nSince the late 1990s, Wong's films have fared much worse in the box office due to the sluggish recession which has been enveloping Hong Kong cinema in the new millennium. However a number of his films released in the 2010s, such as \"From Vegas to Macau\", have seen renewed success for the director, particularly in mainland China.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1851775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851775", "title": "ANSMET", "text": "ANSMET\n\nANSMET (Antarctic Search for Meteorites) is a program funded by the Office of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation that looks for meteorites in the Transantarctic Mountains. This geographical area serves as a collection point for meteorites that have originally fallen on the extensive high-altitude ice fields throughout Antarctica. Such meteorites are quickly covered by subsequent snowfall and begin a centuries-long journey traveling \"downhill\" across the Antarctic continent while embedded in a vast sheet of flowing ice. Portions of such flowing ice can be halted by natural barriers such as the Transantarctic Mountains. Subsequent wind erosion of the motionless ice brings trapped meteorites back to the surface once more where they may be collected. This process concentrates meteorites in a few specific areas to much higher concentrations than they are normally found everywhere else. The contrast of the dark meteorites against the white snow, and lack of terrestrial rocks on the ice, makes such meteorites relatively easy to find. However, the vast majority of such ice-embedded meteorites eventually slide undiscovered into the ocean.\n\nThe first Antarctic meteorite was discovered during the 1911-14 Douglas Mawson Australasian Antarctic Expedition. Subsequent discoveries of three more were made in 1961 and 1964 by Russian geologists near Novolazarevskaya Station, and USGS geologists in the Thiel and Neptune Mountains. In 1969, Japanese explorers discovered nine meteorites at the Yamato Mountains, and 12 more during the 1973-74 season, 663 during the 1974-75 season, and 307 during the 1975-76 season. Based on that success, William A. Cassidy received funding for ANSMET to commence in the 1976-77 season. Cassidy was the Principal Investigator for the 1976-77 season, and subsequent seasons up to and including the 1993-94 season.\n\nThe ANSMET program, together with parallel Antarctic collection programs run by Japan, China, and other nations, is a major source of the extraterrestrial material that is available for scientific investigation. All of the material collected by ANSMET is curated for the purpose of research and public education, in contrast to meteorites collected privately, the bulk of which are frequently sold to collectors.\n\nAs of 2003, ANSMET had collected 8409 chondrites and 234 achondrites, in addition to a Lunar meteorite ALH 81005, and the Martian meteorites EETA 79001, ALH77005 and ALH84001.\n\nThe search for the meteorites is done visually. A team of four to ten explorers, typically meteorite scientists, lives for 5–7 weeks on the ice field. Using snowmobiles spaced 30 m apart they scan the blue ice for meteorites. Once a specimen has been located its position is found using GPS and it is given an identification number. It is then placed in a sterile Teflon bag. The teams make sure that the specimen remains frozen throughout its journey back to the Antarctic Meteorite Curation Facility at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Since 1976, ANSMET has returned over 20,000 meteorites. Meteorites of greater interest and undergoing detailed study are kept at JSC for distribution to the scientific community, though, ultimately, all samples collected by ANSMET are transferred to the Smithsonian Institution for permanent storage and curation. These meteorites are housed at the Smithsonian Museum Support Center clean room facility at Suitland, Maryland, which is modeled after the Lunar Processing Laboratory at NASA’s Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Of the almost 16,000 Antarctic meteorites collected since 1976, over 14,000 have been permanently transferred to the Smithsonian. Curators at the Department of Mineral Sciences at the National Museum of Natural History classify each representative chip of meteorite sent by NASA. Results and descriptions are published in the Antarctic Meteorite Newsletter, issued twice a year.\n\nThe naming convention for Antarctic meteorites collected by ANSMET is as follows: a three letter prefix based on the location the meteorite is found, followed by two numbers that designate the year of collection, and a three number unique identifier. For example, ALH84001 was collected in the Allen Hills region in 1984.\n\nThe 2004–2005 ANSMET expedition consisted of 12 members and collectively they returned 1,230 meteorites. These included over of pallasite meteorites, one of which is the largest yet found in Antarctica at over .\n\nThe 2006–2007 ANSMET expedition consisted of a 9-member systematic team (including astronaut Don Pettit) that explored the Grosvenor Mountains and a 4-member reconnaissance team that explored Scott Glacier and Reedy Glacier as possible destinations for future expeditions.\n\nThe 2009–2010 ANSMET expedition consisted of 8 members that returned 1010 meteorites.\n\nThe 2010–2011 ANSMET expedition consisted of a 9-member systematic team and a 4-member reconnaissance team (including astronaut Serena Aunon-Chancellor) that explored new areas where future teams may go. Collectively they returned over 1200 meteorites.\n\nThe 2011–2012 ANSMET expedition returned to the Miller Range. Despite being hampered by heavy snow, the team collected 302 meteorites, which was just enough to bring the total number of meteorites collected by ANSMET over the 20,000 milestone.\n\n\n\n"}

The concept of NRF was first endorsed with a declaration of NATO's Heads of State at the Prague Summit on 22 November 2002. It was then approved by NATO Defence Ministers in June 2003, and the first headquarters created in October 2003 in Italy under command of NATO Joint Force Command in Brunssum, Netherlands, designated NRF 1. Its rotation replacement was designated NRF 2 (2004) at the same time.\n\nRotating forces through the NRF requires nations to meet the demanding standards needed for collective defence and expeditionary operations. As the standards are very high, participation in the NRF is preceded by a six-month NATO exercise program in order to integrate and standardize the various national contingents. Generally, nations carry out a pre-training period in preparation for the NATO exercises of between 6–18 months. Once activated Reconnaissance Teams deploy within 5 days. This is the first of a number of deployment phases that lead to the deployment of the entire HQ Joint Task Force and Immediate Reaction Forces within 30 days.\n\nThe NRF is certified by NATO to perform a wide variety of tasks including: providing an immediate response capability for conducting collective defence of Alliance members in the event of an Article V operation;\n\n\nThe NRF has three elements:\n\nCommand & Control element: This is based on a deployable Joint Force Headquarters. Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) has overall strategic command of the NRF. NATO's two Joint Force Commands, based in Brunssum, Netherlands and Naples, Italy take one-year turns to command the NRF.\n\nImmediate Response Force (IRF): The IRF element is designed to provide the initial response to a crisis and is not scaled to be a stand-alone force for all but the smallest operations. If further land, maritime or air capabilities are required, they will be drawn from the Response Forces Pool.\n\nResponse Forces Pool (RFP): The RFP consists of a broad spectrum of military capabilities encompassing command and control, combat and support units. There is no fixed size to the RFP. The forces contributed to the RFP are drawn from the much wider pool of Allied or Partners National deployable forces.\n\nDuring the 2014 Wales summit NATO leaders agreed to establish a Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF). The VJTF will be a high-readiness \"Spearhead Force\" able to deploy at short notice to threats against NATO sovereignty. It will consist of a land brigade numbering around 5,000 troops, supported by air, sea and special forces. The VJTF would be supported by two more land brigades as a \"rapid reinforcement capability\" in case of a major crisis. Altogether, the enhanced NATO Response Force will amount to around 30,000 troops.\n\nAs of January 2015, units assigned to the NRF have been used on four occasions:\n\nOf NATO's non-member partners, Finland and Sweden joined the Response Force in 2008 and 2013, respectively. Ukraine and Georgia began contributions, respectively, in 2014 and 2015.\n\n\n"}

The Ok Tedi Mine is located near the headwaters of the river, which is sourced in the Star Mountains. Nearly the entirety of the river runs through the North Fly District of the Western Province of Papua New Guinea, but the river crosses the international boundary with Indonesia for less than one kilometre. The largest settlement of the Western Province, Tabubil is located near its banks.\n\nKnown as the Ok Tedi River by the Yonggom people who live on its western bank, it was renamed the Alice River by the Italian explorer Luigi d'Albertis. \"Ok\" is the word for water or river in the Ok languages family. It is a tributary of the Fly River. Tributaries of the Ok Tedi include the Birim.\n\nThe Kiunga-Tabubil Highway runs parallel with the river for the majority of its course, until just south of Ningerum where the highway veers southeast towards Kiunga, a port town on the Fly River.\n\nThe river is extremely fast-moving and has a massive capacity. It is situated on a sand bank, which allows for the river to change course quickly without warning. The sand conditions underneath the river and the extremely high rainfall of the catchment area make it one of the fastest moving rivers in the world. The roar from the river can be heard for many kilometres through the dense jungle of the district.\n\nThe pristine river was devastated by the Ok Tedi environmental disaster, an enormous open pit copper/gold mine which discharges waste directly into the river. Until its recent seizure by the Papua New Guinea government the mine was owned by BHP Billiton, an Anglo-Australian multinational mining, metals and petroleum company headquartered in Melbourne, Australia.

Services were held five days after the train wreck. The identity of many victims of the wreck was unknown. Most of the markers note \"unidentified male\" (or female). One is marked \"Smiley,\" another \"Baldy,\" and \"4 Horse Driver.\"\n\nThe Showmen's Rest section of Woodlawn Cemetery is still used for burials of deceased showmen who are said to be performing now at the biggest of the Big Tops. A Memorial Day service is held at Woodlawn Cemetery every year.\n\nOther Showmen's Rests include one at Mount Olivet Cemetery, Hugo, Oklahoma. Hugo is a winter circus home which calls itself Circus City, USA. In Miami, Florida, the largest Showmen's Rest is at Southern Memorial Park where large elephant and lion statues flank hundreds of markers commemorating circus greats and not-so-greats. Tampa, Florida's Showmen's Rest is located close to the Greater Tampa Showmen's Association near downtown.\n\nFollowing the wreck of June 22, 1918, the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus had to cancel only two performances: the one in Hammond, Indiana and its next stop Monroe, Wisconsin. This was due in part by the assistance by many of its so-called competitors, including Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus lending needed equipment and performers so that the show could go on. The city of Hammond also joined in to help the surviving circus performers and workers. Many of the city's residents and shopkeepers gave food and clothing as well. Statues of five elephants surround the Showmen's Rest section of Woodlawn Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois. The elephants each have a foot raised with a ball underneath, and the trunks lowered. (Raised trunks are a symbol of joy and excitement; lowered trunks symbolize mourning). The base of the large central elephant is inscribed with \"Showmen's League of America\". On the others are the words \"Showmen's Rest\". Some nearby residents say the sounds of ghostly elephants can be heard at night. However, as a note, there were no elephants that were buried there. And for those looking for an explanation for the sounds, Brookfield Zoo is only a few miles away (although no elephants are in captivity at the Zoo as of June 2015).\n\n\n"}

It was the eastern branch of the MCI Internet Exchange. Its name officially stood for \"Metropolitan Area Exchange, East\".\n\nMAE-East was founded in the 1990s as one of the first large Internet peering exchanges and by 1997 it was estimated half the world's traffic passed through it. At the time it was located in the underground parking garage of an office building in Vienna, VA.\n\nMAE-East was originally created in 1992, primarily by Scott Yeager of Metropolitan Fiber Systems (MFS) and Rick Adams of UUNET. Steven Feldman, an Internet architect, recalls \"A group of network providers in the Virginia area got together over beer one night and decided to connect their networks.\" The founding networks were AlterNet (UUNET's backbone service), PSINet and Sprint-ICM. MFS was the service provider offering metropolitan fiber, co-location facilities, cross connects and switch ports for the ISPs to interconnect. MAE-East was modeled after FIX East and Fix West. It was established as a Distributed Layer 2 exchange (shared 10-Mbps Ethernet over DS3). By February 1993, the 10-Mbps metropolitan Ethernet-over-DS3 connected the Sprint POP (ICMnet and AlterNet), College Park POP (AlterNet and NSFNet), MCI POP (SURAnet), and WillTel POP (PSINet). It did not have a multi-lateral policy or have multi-lateral agreements, meaning it was a neutral exchange from the perspective that any ISP could join, all members were treated the same, but there was no requirement for any other members to peer with that ISP.\n\nIn 1993, the National Science Foundation awarded MFS/MAE-East a grant establishing it as one of the four original NAPs (Network Access Point). MAE-East then migrated to a collocation-based exchange in order to support higher speeds with the original colo at 1919 Gallows Road in Vienna, in a cinder-block room carved out of the underground P1 parking garage. The MAE upgraded to switched Ethernet and shared FDDI in Fall 1994, growing to seven GigaSwitches] (a precursor to Gigabit Ethernet). The FDDI architecture consisted of collocations at 8100 Boone Blvd (location of MFS offices across the road from Gallows Road), 1919 Gallows Road, and a number of private customer POPs. The GigaSwitch access was limited to 100 Mbps, suffered from Head-of-Line Blocking, reached scaling limits, and was difficult to maintain (i.e., suffered outages). MAE-East FDDI was closed to new customers after 1998 and was shut down in June 2001.\n\nMAE-East ATM was created as successor to the FDDI due to the FDDI limitations. MAE-East ATM was trialed in 1997 and went into production in 1998. ATM allowed for high-speed access (e.g. DS3 -OC-12c); managed resources to eliminate congestion; Virtual Private Interconnect (PVCs), which mitigated effects of some behaviors where a single customer could impact the entire exchange. Frame Relay Access was added in 2002-2003 (OC-3c to OC-48c). In 2003, MAE-East ATM/Frame facilities were located at Boone Blvd, Sunrise Blvd, Tyco Road and Ashburn VA.\n\nBY 2009, many of the ISPs at MAE-East had moved to Equinix Ashburn, a competing Internet Exchange (IX). Today, several on-line resources (peeringdb.org, internetexchangemap.com) suggest MAE-East is gone. In any event, large providers tend to connect directly to allow higher speeds and reduce costs. Many of the smaller providers are now simply customers of the tier 1 network operators.\n\nThe following providers were members of this exchange:\n\n\n\n\"How Equinix beat MAE-East,\" a blog written in 2009.\n"}

It is affiliated with both the National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), and is affiliated with the AFL-CIO.\n\nThe union's headquarters are located in St. Paul, Minnesota, and it represented more than 90,000 members in 2017. An annual Representative Convention of approximately 900 elected delegates meets each year, and is the organization's highest governing body. Between Representative Conventions, a 44-member governing board meets monthly. The governing board sets dues, establishes a budget and carries out the policy directives of the Representative Convention. Three full-time officers — a president, vice president and secretary-treasurer — guide the union between meetings of the governing board. Education Minnesota employed about 170 staff in 2017.\n\nThe union was created in March 1997 by the merger of the Minnesota Education Association (MEA) and the Minnesota Federation of Teachers (MFT). The merger was approved by both parent unions, and took effect on Sept. 1, 1998. At the time, the AFT and NEA were discussing a national merger. The two unions had increasingly collaborated for several years, and the merger of the two unions was considered a precursor to national merger. Subsequently, neither parent union laid down many ground rules for the merger.\n\nThe planned merger between the AFT and NEA fell through after the merger agreement, which had been approved by the AFT, failed to win the necessary two-thirds majority at the NEA convention.\n\nEducation Minnesota — which was affiliated with both the AFT and NEA — remained unaffected by the failed national merger. Judy Schaubach, president of MEA, and Sandra Peterson, president of MFT, were elected as co-presidents. But the lack of pre-merger ground rules came back to haunt the merged union. Disagreement between the two parent unions broke out over payment of per capita dues. Each parent union insisted that it receive its full dues, which would have doubled the dues of Education Minnesota members. The issue remained unresolved for two years, until an agreement was reached that established a new dues level. Back dues to NEA were paid down, while AFT forgave its anticipated dues.\n\nSeveral NEA and AFT state and local teacher unions had merged in the 1960s and 1970s, including affiliates in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New Orleans, and throughout Florida. The Education Minnesota merger had encouraged other NEA and AFT state teacher unions in the United States to consider a merger as well. The Montana Education Association and Montana Federation of Teachers merged in September 2000, and discussions were under way in Missouri, New Mexico, New York and Texas. Meanwhile, in 26 states NEA and AFT state affiliates had signed \"no-raid\" agreements, which set jurisdictions for each state affiliate and prohibited each union from absorbing the other.\n\nMeanwhile, AFT president Sandra Feldman publicly voiced her conclusion that state mergers would continue until a \"de facto\" merger of the two unions occurred.\n\nBoth parent unions recognized a need for ground rules before any additional state mergers. Each union adopted a series of guidelines for approval of state mergers. Through the NEA-AFT joint council, \"NEAFT,\" the AFT and NEA agreed to additional guidelines that must be met for future state mergers to move forward smoothly.\n\nThe annual Minnesota Educator Academy (\"MEA\"), previously known as the Education Minnesota Professional Conference, is the largest professional development opportunity for educators in Minnesota. It takes place the third Thursday in October. Those days, students do not have classes, enabling educators in Minnesota to attend the conference. The weekend is one of the busiest travel times in Minnesota, even busier than Thanksgiving.\n"}

Dunning\n\nParis Chipman Dunning (March 15, 1806 – May 9, 1884) was a Democratic state representative, state senator, senate president pro tempore, the tenth Lieutenant Governor, and the ninth Governor of the U.S. state of Indiana from December 26, 1848 to December 5, 1849. He is the only person to hold to every elected seat in the state government under the 1816 constitution. His brief term as governor was marked by the calling of a state constitutional convention and overshadowed by the national anti-slavery debate, where Dunning urged state leaders to issue and forward resolutions to Congress expressing opposition to the expansion of slavery. As a delegate to the subsequent convention, he successfully advocated legislative and educational reform. As the American Civil War broke out, he left the Democratic party and declared for the Union, personally raising many companies of soldiers for the war effort. He returned to the state senate during the war, and then resumed his law practice after his term ended. He remained popular in the state, and declined several nominations to run for office after retiring from politics.\n\nDunning was born in 1806 in Greensboro, Guilford County, North Carolina the youngest of the six sons of James and Rachel North Dunning. He attended the nearby Greensboro Academy and graduated at age seventeen. Upon graduation he enrolled in the state university at Chapel Hill to study medicine. After the death of his father, he, his mother, and one older brother moved to Bloomington, Indiana where Dunning briefly taught school. There he met Sarah Alexander; the couple married on July 6, 1826 and had four children.\n\nHe and his wife moved to Louisville, Kentucky for a short time to complete his medical training and then he opened a medical practice in Rockville, Indiana. The practice was short lived as he became more interested in law. He returned to his mother and older brother in Bloomington and began to study law in office of future Governor James Whitcomb and Congressman Tilghman A. Howard before being admitted to the bar in 1833. Working in the law office, he met Indiana's Democratic Party leaders, and impressed many of them who saw him as a potential candidate for office.\n\nDunning was elected to represent Monroe County in the Indiana House of Representatives in 1833. He was reelected twice, and served three one years terms, ending in 1836. That year he was elected to the Indiana State Senate representing Monroe and Brown County. During his years in the Indiana General Assembly, he had voted for the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act that had led the state to bankruptcy in 1841. He served two three year terms before opening his Bloomington law practice in 1840. His exit from elected office was probably related to his support of the improvement act. He continued to be active in the party, and was a presidential elector in 1844, and cast his vote for James K. Polk.\n\nIn 1846 Whitcomb ran for his second term as governor of Indiana. Whitcomb choose Dunning to run as his Lieutenant Governor, and their ticket won. Dunning served in the position until Whitcomb was elected to the United States Senate in December 1848. Whitcomb resigned from office and Dunning was elevated to his seat.\n\nDunning served a brief term, but it was time of several momentous events in the state. Indiana had just emerged from a period of bankruptcy, and Dunning oversaw the final phase of the process, ensuring the public works were turned over to the state's creditors and that the debt reduction deal was fully carried out. Congress was debating the extension of slavery in the western territories during his term, leading to bitter hostilities between northern and southern leaders. Dunning delivered a speech to the General Assembly in which he condemned the expansion of slavery and called for its gradual elimination. He was the first outspoken anti-slavery governor since William Hendricks, and he recommended the assembly pass a resolution for him to forward to Congress. In response, the assembly passed a strong resolution requesting Indiana's congressional delegation to oppose the expansion of slavery.\n\nGovernor Whitcomb had already started a movement in the legislature to call a constitutional convention, and Dunning continued to support the effort to have a ballot initiative to replace the constitution. Dunning left office in 1849 and returned to his law practice.\n\nIn 1850, voters approved a ballot to authorize the formation of a constitutional convention to replace the Indiana Constitution. Dunning was one of the most prominent delegates to attend the convention and took the lead in pushing for several reforms. Among his proposals was a ban on special legislation, because the legislature had become notorious for passing laws that were only applied to certain counties or towns. Dunning was able to have a clause entered into article 4 of the constitution that required all laws passed by the assembly to be applied uniformly across the entire state, ending the practice.\n\nHis position on public schools was also added to article 8 of the constitution. The state's literacy rate had dropped from 90% in 1840, to 80% in 1850, and having served on the board of Indiana College between 1841 and 1868, he became aware of the poor condition of public education in the state. His proposals guaranteed equal opportunity for women in public education, something unknown in most of the nation. He also strengthened the free common school cause by requiring the state to fund the public school system, while allowing local school boards to maintain control of their districts' curriculum, hiring, and school arrangements.\n\nDunning was nominated by the Democratic party to run for Congress in 1856, but he declined primarily due to the fractured nature of the party at that time. He, along with a large part of the party, was at odds with its state leadership who were sympathetic to the south. In 1860 he did accept a nomination to be a delegate to the party's convention in Charleston, South Carolina, and the second convention held in Baltimore. In both convention he voted in favor of Stephen Douglas, and favored compromise on the slavery issue. When the American Civil War finally broke out in the next year, Dunning publicly declared himself for the Union and set to work raising companies of men for the war effort. In the end, he was personally responsible to the recruitment of nearly two full regiments of men.\n\nIn 1861, he left the Democratic party, and was reelected to the state senate as an Independent and supported the Republican governor throughout the war. Governor Oliver P. Morton had a stroke in 1865, and traveled to Europe for treatment and Conrad Baker became acting governor. Dunning was then elected president pro tempore of the senate to fill Baker's place. Dunning's wife died in 1863 and Dunning remarried to the widow of Allen Ashford on September 17, 1865. When his term in the Senate ended in 1867, he was nominated to run again, but declined. He declined a second offer to run for Congress in 1868, preferring to remain in his law practice. Dunning gained a national reputation as a lawyer, and was committed to criminal law. His reputation was such that his clients were \"assured of success when he was on the case.\"\n\nDunning continued to be active in public affairs, despite refusing to take public office. He continued to be active in his law practice, hearing cases until a week before his death. Dunning died on May 9, 1884, aged 78, in Bloomington, Indiana, and is buried there in Rose Hill Cemetery.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "1851809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851809", "title": "Virtual Private LAN Service", "text": "Virtual Private LAN Service\n\nVirtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a way to provide Ethernet-based multipoint to multipoint communication over IP or MPLS networks. It allows geographically dispersed sites to share an Ethernet broadcast domain by connecting sites through pseudowires. The term 'sites' includes multiplicities of both servers and clients. The technologies that can be used as pseudo-wire can be Ethernet over MPLS, L2TPv3 or even GRE. There are two IETF standards track RFCs (RFC 4761 and RFC 4762) describing VPLS establishment.\n\nVPLS is a virtual private network (VPN) technology. In contrast to L2TPv3, which allows only point-to-point layer 2 tunnels, VPLS allows any-to-any (multipoint) connectivity. \n\nIn a VPLS, the local area network (LAN) at each site is extended to the edge of the provider network. The provider network then emulates a switch or bridge to connect all of the customer LANs to create a single bridged LAN.\n\nVPLS is designed for applications that require multipoint or broadcast access.\n\nSince VPLS emulates a LAN, full mesh connectivity is required. There are two methods for full mesh establishment for VPLS: using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP). The \"control plane\" is the means by which provider edge (PE) routers communicate for auto-discovery and signalling. Auto-discovery refers to the process of finding other PE routers participating in the same VPN or VPLS. Signalling is the process of establishing pseudowires (PW). The PWs constitute the \"data plane\", whereby PEs send customer VPN/VPLS traffic to other PEs.\n\nBGP provides both auto-discovery and signalling. The mechanisms used are very similar to those used in establishing Layer-3 MPLS VPNs. Each PE is configured to participate in a given VPLS. The PE, through the use of BGP, simultaneously discovers all other PEs in the same VPLS, and establishes a full mesh of pseudowires to those PEs.\n\nWith LDP, each PE router must be configured to participate in a given VPLS, and, in addition, be given the addresses of other PEs participating in the same VPLS. A full mesh of LDP sessions is then established between these PEs. LDP is then used to create an equivalent mesh of PWs between those PEs.\n\nAn advantage to using PWs as the underlying technology for the data plane is that in the event of failure, traffic will automatically be routed along available backup paths in the service provider's network. Failover will be much faster than could be achieved with e.g. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). VPLS is thus a more reliable solution for linking together Ethernet networks in different locations than simply connecting a WAN link to Ethernet switches in both locations.\n\nVPLS has significant advantages for both service providers and customers. Service providers benefit because they can generate additional revenues by offering a new Ethernet service with flexible bandwidth and sophisticated service level agreements (SLAs). VPLS is also simpler and more cost effective to operate than a traditional service. Customers benefit because they can connect all of their sites to an Ethernet VPN that provides a secure, high speed and homogenous network. Moreover, VPLS provides a logical next step in the continuing evolution of Ethernet from a 10 Mbit/s shared LAN protocol to a multi-Gbps global service.\n\nVPLS MPLS packets have a two-label stack. The outer label is used for normal MPLS forwarding in the service provider's network. If BGP is used to establish the VPLS, the inner label is allocated by a PE as part of a label block. If LDP is used, the inner label is a virtual circuit ID assigned by LDP when it first established a mesh between the participating PEs. Every PE keeps track of assigned inner label, and associates these with the VPLS instance.\n\nPEs participating in a VPLS-based VPN must appear as an Ethernet bridge to connected customer edge (CE) devices. Received Ethernet frames must be treated in such a way as to ensure CEs can be simple Ethernet devices.\n\nWhen a PE receives a frame from a CE, it inspects the frame and learns the CE's MAC address, storing it locally along with LSP routing information. It then checks the frame's destination MAC address. If it is a broadcast frame, or the MAC address is not known to the PE, it floods the frame to all PEs in the mesh.\n\nEthernet does not have a time to live (TTL) field in its frame header, so loop avoidance must be arranged by other means. In regular Ethernet deployments, Spanning Tree Protocol is used for this. In VPLS, loop avoidance is arranged by the following rule: A PE \"never\" forwards a frame received from a PE to another PE. The use of a full mesh combined with split horizon forwarding guarantees a loop-free broadcast domain.\n\nVPLS is typically used to link a large number of sites together. Therefore, scalability is an important issue that needs addressing.\n\nVPLS requires a full mesh in both the control and data planes; this can be difficult to scale. For BGP, the control plane scaling issue has long been addressed, through the use of route reflectors (RRs). RRs are extensively used in the context of Internet routing, as well as for several types of VPNs. To scale the data plane for multicast and broadcast traffic, there is work in progress to use point-to-multipoint LSPs as the underlying transport.\n\nFor LDP, a method of subdividing a VPLS VPN into two or three tiered hierarchical networks was developed. Called hierarchical VPLS (HVPLS), it introduces a new type of MPLS device: the multi-tenant unit (MTU) switch. This switch aggregates multiple customers into a single PE, which in turn needs only one control and data plane connection into the mesh. This can significantly reduce the number of LDP sessions and LSPs, and thus unburden the core network, by concentrating customers in edge devices.\n\nHVPLS (LDP) may also be used to join two VPLS mesh structures together. Without using HVPLS, every node in each VPLS mesh must become meshed with all nodes in the other VPLS mesh. However, with HVPLS, the two meshes can essentially be joined together at certain locations. Techniques such as redundant pseudowires can provide resiliency in case of failures at the interconnection points.\n\nSince VPLS links multiple Ethernet broadcast domains together, it effectively creates a much larger broadcast domain. Since every PE must keep track of all MAC addresses and associated LSP routing information, this can potentially result in a large amount of memory being needed in every PE in the mesh.\n\nTo counter this problem, sites may use a router as the CE device. This hides all MAC addresses on that site behind the CE's MAC address.\n\nPE devices may also be equipped with content-addressable memory (CAM), similar to high-end Ethernet switches.\n\nAn alternative mechanism is using MAT (MAC Address Translation). However, at the time of writing this, there are no vendors providing MAT functionality.\n\nIn a VPLS-based VPN with a large number of sites, manually configuring every participating PE does not scale well. If a new PE is taken into service, every existing PE needs to have its configuration adjusted to establish an LDP session with the new PE. Standardisation work is in progress to enable auto-discovery of participating PEs. Three implementations are being worked on:\n\nThe LDP method of PE auto-discovery is based on that used by the Label Distribution Protocol to distribute labels across P and PE routers within a single autonomous system. \n\nThe BGP method of PE auto-discovery is based on that used by Layer-3 MPLS VPNs to distribute VPN routes among PEs participating in a VPN. The BGP4 Multi-Protocol (BGP-MP) extensions are used to distribute VPN IDs and VPN-specific reachability information. Since IBGP requires either a full mesh of BGP sessions or the use of a route reflector, enabling the VPN ID in a participating PEs existing BGP configuration provides it with a list of all PEs in that VPN. Note that this method is for auto-discovery alone; LDP is still used for signaling. The method of establishing VPLS with BGP described above accomplishes both auto-discovery and signalling.\n\nThis method requires ALL PEs to be configured with one or more RADIUS servers to use. When the first CE router in a particular VPLS VPN connects to the PE, it uses the CE's identification to request authentication from the RADIUS server. This identification may be provided by the CE or may be configured into the PE for that particular CE. In addition to a username and password, the identification string also contains a VPN name and an optional provider name.\n\nThe RADIUS server keeps track of all PEs that requested authentication for a particular VPN and returns a list of them to the PE requesting authentication. The PE then establishes LDP sessions to every PE in the list.\n\n\n"}

At least half of its members are believed to be outside the United States.\n\nThe primary purpose of the website is to reconnect with old friends and classmates, which is related in the site's tagline \"Making the World a Smaller Place.\" After registration, the names of all people in the database are fully searchable. However, contact with these members is limited until the database is \"unlocked\" by obtaining a \"blue membership\".\n\nAs of October 2006, blue memberships can be purchased for one- or three-year periods, or obtained for free by referring friends. However, as of July 2013, there does not appear to be any functioning way to upgrade and there is a permanent message saying \"Please come back later\" translated into seven languages in that part of the site.

United Online CEO Mark Goldston said the acquisition of \"The Names Database is a great addition to Classmates.com and furthers our overall mission of connecting people.\" As of 2013, United Online no longer mentions the company in its Form 10-K annual report except once to say it \"excludes\" in its \"active accounts\" calculation.\n\nBefore the acquisition, the company's legal name was actually Opobox, Inc. and was doing business as The Names Database. According to Delaware corporation records (where the company was registered), Opobox had been around since 2001. For a period of two years the business was registered but inactive. The Names Database was formed in 2003 after Gabriel Weinberg put up pages of names that were subsequently indexed by search engines.\n\nLike other social networks such as Hi5, Names Database has been criticized for being too aggressive at encouraging registrants to refer friends. Upon registration the site immediately asks you to refer friends and then checks the validity of any address you enter, attempting to disallow fraudulent information.

Also, all outgoing emails appear to follow the rules stipulated in the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 including proper opt-out links, listed physical addresses and information about how the original email address was collected.\n\nAnother area of criticism has been the expanded license granted to the site for information entered to it upon registration. However, this license is substantially similar or identical to that granted to other social networking services. Additionally, the site appears to try to collect only the minimal amount of information needed to find an old friend and classmate (name, birth year, email address and high school country with optional maiden name) as opposed to more invasive required information like gender, zip code and birth date as found on other sites.\n\nClassmates.com itself (the parent company) has been criticized for controversial business practices and legal issues, but it is unclear how much of this criticism also applies to their subsidiaries.

Such a printer uses a light-emitting diode (LED) array as a light source in the printhead instead of the laser used in laser printers and, more generally, in the xerography process. The LED bar pulse-flashes across the entire page width and creates the image on the print drum or belt as it moves past.\n\nLEDs are more efficient and reliable than conventional laser printers, since they have fewer moving parts, allowing for less mechanical wear. Depending on design, LED printers can have faster rates of print than some laser-based designs, and are generally cheaper to manufacture. In contrast to LED printers, laser printers require combinations of rotating mirrors and lenses that must remain in alignment throughout their use. The LED print head has no moving parts, and the individual assemblies tend to be more compact.\nOki Electric Industry claims to have made the first LED printer in 1981. A commercialized variant called OPP6220 was developed in 1986. It was a compact monotonic printer with a resolution of 240 dpi and a speed of 16 ppm. A 1989 model called OL400 was noted for its low cost. By 1997, Oki has pushed the resolution to 1200 dpi, and has produced upscaled models that handle A3-sized paper. The OKIPAGE 8c from 1998 was the first color LED printer for OKI. It simply utilizes a tandem array of four LED-toner pairs.\n\nOKI Data has developed specialty LED Printers that use a CMYW toner system rather than CMYK. The OKI 920WT and 711WT have been developed for the apparel decorating industry, replacing the typical BLACK toners (\"K\") with a White toner. The purpose is to allow the heat transfer application to dark fabrics and maintain the vibrancy of the colors. The LED immediately prints and dries the full color image onto a velum-like material that is then heat pressed to an adhesive sheet for application.\n"}

{"id": "1851849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851849", "title": "Clinohumite", "text": "Clinohumite\n\nClinohumite is an uncommon member of the humite group, a magnesium silicate according to the chemical formula (Mg, Fe)(SiO)(F,OH). The formula can be thought of as four olivine (MgSiO), plus one brucite (Mg(OH)). Indeed, the mineral is essentially a hydrated olivine and occurs in altered ultramafic rocks and carbonatites. Most commonly found as tiny indistinct grains, large euhedral clinohumite crystals are sought by collectors and occasionally fashioned into bright, yellow-orange gemstones. Only two sources of gem-quality material are known: the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan, and the Taymyr region of northern Siberia. It is one of two humite group minerals that have been cut into gems, the other being the much more common chondrodite.\n\nA monoclinic mineral, clinohumite is typically a dark to light brownish or orangy yellow, somewhat resembling the hessonite variety of grossular. Clinohumite's crystal habit is usually granular, but may also be prismatic; crystals are almost always small. Simple and multiple crystal twinning (on {001}) is common, resulting in a highly variable habit. Clinohumite is brittle with a hardness of 6 and a poor basal cleavage. Its specific gravity is 3.2–3.4, and its fracture is conchoidal to uneven; its streak is white.\n\nClinohumite's transparency ranges from transparent to translucent; its luster ranges from a dull vitreous to resinous. Its refractive index (as measured via sodium light, 589.3 nm) is as follows: α 1.631; β 1.638–1.647; γ 1.668;, with a maximum birefringence of 0.028 (biaxial positive). Under shortwave ultraviolet light, some clinohumite may fluoresce an orangy yellow; there is little to no response under longwave UV.\n\nThe Taymyr material is reported to be a dark reddish brown while the Pamir material is a bright yellow to orange or brownish orange. The Pamir material also has a hardness slightly greater than 6, a lower specific gravity (3.18), and higher maximum birefringence (0.036). Phillip Youngman, master faceter of Los Osos, California, noticed not only that Pamir material is harder than expected, but also that it is less brittle than expected. Youngman observed that clinohumite reacted like beryl to cutting and polishing, and that it reminded him of polishing diopside.\n\nLike other members of the humite group, the relative amounts of hydroxyl and fluorine vary in clinohumite, and iron commonly substitutes for some of the magnesium, bringing about changes in physical and optical properties. Titanium substitution also causes pronounced changes in optical properties, producing the variety \"titanclinohumite\". Consequently, it is relatively easy to determine that a stone is a humite group mineral, but difficult to determine exactly which member. Other common impurities of clinohumite include aluminium, manganese, and calcium.\n\nClinohumite is a product of contact metamorphism and is commonly found as indistinct grains embedded in limestone. Its type occurrence is within the limestone ejecta of the Mount Vesuvius volcano complex near Naples, Italy, where clinohumite was discovered in 1876. The aforementioned gem-quality occurrences of Pamir and Taymyr were discovered only recently: the former in the early 1980s, and the latter in 2000. These deposits are scarce and only sporadically mined, so clinohumite remains one of the rarest gemstones with only a few thousand carats known to exist in private collections.\n\nOther (non-gem quality) occurrences of clinohumite include: the Sør Rondane and Balchen Mountains of Antarctica; Mount Bischoff, Waratah, Tasmania; the Saualpe Mountains of Carinthia, the Koralpe mountains of Styria, and the Vals, Virgen, and Ziller valleys of the Tyrol, Austria; the Jacupiranga mine of Cajati, São Paulo State, Southeast Region, Brazil; the Pirin Mountains of Bulgaria; Bancroft, Ontario, Notre Dame du Laus, Wakefield, and Villedieu Township, Quebec, Canada; Southern and Western Finland; Bavaria and Saxony, Germany; eastern Greenland; Ambasamudram in Tamil Nadu, India; Honshū, Japan; Suan, North Korea; Nordland, Norway; KwaZulu-Natal and Northern Cape Province, South Africa; Andalusia, Spain; Värmland and Västmanland, Sweden; Isle of Skye, Scotland; and the states of California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Utah, and Washington, US.\n\nClinohumite also occurs as a minor component of some masses of peridotite from the Earth's mantle emplaced into the Earth's crust and as a very rare component of peridotite xenoliths. These occurrences and implications have been summarized by Luth (2003) in a discussion of the possible importance of the mineral as a significant reservoir of water in the Earth's mantle. Titanium is a minor constituent of clinohumite in most such occurrences. Clinohumite is stable throughout the upper mantle to depths of at least and is a potential host phase for H (water) in this region of the Earth's interior.\n\nMinerals associated with humite include grossular, wollastonite, forsterite, monticellite, cuspidine, fluoborite, ludwigite, dolomite, calcite, talc, biotite, spinel, vesuvianite, sanidine, meionite and nepheline.\n\nThe structure is monoclinic with space group \"P\"2/\"b\" (\"a\"-unique). The unit cell has \"a\" = 4.7488 Å; \"b\" = 10.2875 Å; \"c\" = 13.6967 Å; and alpha = 100.63°; V = 667.65 Å; Z = 2 for pure Mg hydroxyl-clinohumite. The odd setting of space group \"P\"2/\"c\" is chosen to preserve the \"a\" and \"b\" axes of olivine. The structure is closely related to that of olivine as well as the other humite minerals. Mg and Fe are in octahedral coordination with oxygen and silicon (Si) is in tetrahedral coordination. There are five distinct octahedral sites and two different tetrahedral sites. One of the octahedral sites is bonded to two OH,F atoms and is the site where Ti is partitioned. Clinohumite is a nesosilicate with no oxygen atoms shared between two silicons.\n\n"}

The headwaters of the river are formed in the Kratke Range from where it then travels about northwest to the Bismarck Sea.\n\nAlong the Ramu's course, it receives numerous tributaries from the Bismarck Range to the south and the Finisterre and Adelbert.\n\nFor many millennia, people have lived along the river, and the river has formed the basis for food, transport, and culture.\n\nThe area encompassed by the Ramu was part of Kaiser-Wilhelmsland when Germany established German New Guinea in 1884. The Germans were quick to explore their territory, and the mouth of the Ramu was discovered in 1886 by Vice-Admiral Freiherr von Schleinitz after returning to Finschhafen from an expedition to the nearby Sepik. Schleinitz called the Ramu, \"Ottilien\" after his ship the \"Ottilie\".\n\nThe course of the river was first discovered 10 years later in 1896 after Dr Carl Lauterbach, a botanist, led an expedition organised by the German New Guinea Company (\"Neu Guinea Kompagnie\") to find the headwaters of the Markham River. After crossing the Ortzen Mountains from Astrolabe Bay south of Madang, Lauterbach's party, instead of finding the Markham, found an unknown river flowing northwest. The party canoed along a section before their supplies dwindled; they returned to the coast retracing their route.\n\nAnother German explorer, Ernst Tappenbeck, who had accompanied Lauterbach previously, led the first expedition to ascend the Ramu in 1898. Tappenbeck was charged with discovering whether the \"Ottilien\" found in 1886 was the same river Lauterbech had found. He was accompanied by former Prussian Army officers, a \"Kompagnie\" official and an Australian gold prospector Robert Phillip, and travelled in the \"Neu Guinea Kompagnie\" steamer \"Herzog Johann Albrecht\".\n\nAfter five days of journey up the Ramu, Tappenbeck left his companions at a well-stocked camp when river water levels fell. He returned four and half months later in another steamer, \"Herzogin Elisabeth\", and the party managed to navigate upstream and go farther still by canoe. By the end of 1898, the expedition had established a station on the river, mapped it and tributaries, and made a large botanical collection.\n\nFurther explorations for gold and botanical specimens were conducted by the Germans. In 1902, Hans Klink and J. Schlenzig established a new Ramu station that was later connected by a bridle track to the coast. Dr R. Schlecter led another expedition in 1902 in search of gutta-percha trees. Then in 1907, Austrian explorer Wilhelm Dammköhler led an expedition up the Markham Valley and linked the headwaters of the Markham River with the Ramu for the first time.\n\nAfter the First World War, German New Guinea passed over to Australian control and became the Territory of New Guinea. The Ramu reverted to its local name during this time.\n\nIn 1936, Briton, Lord Moyne, ventured up the Ramu during an expedition to Indonesia and New Guinea. Moyne discovered a race of pygmy-like people inhabiting the middle Ramu region from the mouth of the river in the Aiome foothills.\n\nDuring the Second World War, in 1942 the Japanese annexed the entire Territory of New Guinea from the Australians. Intense fighting occurred between the Imperial Japanese Army and the Australian and US Armies to recapture New Guinea. During the Finisterre Range campaign in 1943 and 1944, the Ramu valley became the scene of a major battle.\n\nThe Ramu flows into Yonki Dam, where it feeds the Ramu 1 power station.\n\nA hydroelectric plant was under construction on the toe of the Yonki Dam, however construction is currently (May 2011) suspended.\n\n"}

An earlier 2006 source would have included areas north of Campbellton Road and south of Erin Road.\n\nSandtown, formerly called Buzzard's Roost, was one of the largest Native villages in the area where Atlanta would develop. After the Trail of Tears and the government of Georgia divided the territory into counties, Sandtown ended up in Campbell County (which was absorbed into Fulton County in 1932 along with Milton County).\n\nThe road now known as Cascade was originally an Indian trail known as the Sandtown Road and ran from the village on the Chattahoochee River near Utoy Creek east through what became Five Points then to the vicinity of Decatur. This was the oldest settled area in current Fulton County. Atlanta's first doctor, Joshua Gilbert, lived along the Sandtown Road near the present-day Cascade Nature Preserve. The Union Army used his home as a hospital during the Battle of Utoy Creek.\n\nDuring the American Civil War there were two roads to Sandtown (the current Cascade and Campbelltown roads), which were prominent locations of Union Army operations during the Siege of Atlanta. The Battle of Utoy Creek was fought along the Sandtown (Cascade) Road in Cascade Heights from 1–7 August 1864. Major General William T. Sherman's headquarters was along the southern Sandtown (Campbellton) Road on 26 August 1864.\n\nIn 2006 Sandtown applied for annexation to the city of Atlanta. Atlanta put Sandtown's application on hold. In 2007 a vote in unincorporated southern Fulton County, including Sandtown, on whether to form a new city of South Fulton, Georgia, resulted against such a formation.\n\nThe neighborhood is served by State Route 6 (SR 6; Camp Creek Parkway) and SR 154/SR 166 (Campbellton Road SW).

The same statute would later be challenged again (successfully) in \"Griswold v.
