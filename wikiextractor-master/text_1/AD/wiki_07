It ended when Israel declared independence and annulled the White Paper.\n\nAfter American, British and Soviet armed forces liberated the camps, survivors suffered from disease, severe malnutrition and depression. Many were displaced persons who were unable to return to their homes from before the war. In some areas the survivors continued to face antisemitic violence; during the 1946 Kielce pogrom in Poland 42 survivors were killed when their communal home was attacked by a mob. For many of the survivors, Europe had become \"a vast cemetery of the Jewish people\" and \"they wanted to start life over and build a new national Jewish homeland in Eretz Yisrael.\"\n\nThe movement of Jewish refugees from the Displaced Persons camp in which they were held (one million persons classified as \"not repatriable\" remained in Germany and Austria) to Palestine was illegal on both sides, as Jews were not officially allowed to leave the countries of Central and Eastern Europe by the Soviet Union and its allies, nor were they permitted to settle in Palestine by the British.\n\nIn late 1944 and early 1945, Jewish members of the Polish resistance met up with Warsaw ghetto fighters in Lubin to form Bricha as a way of escaping the antisemitism of Europe, where they were convinced that another Holocaust would occur. After the liberation of Rivne, Eliezer and Abraham Lidovsky, and Pasha (Isaac) Rajchmann, concluded that there was no future for Jews in Poland. They formed an artisan guild to cover their covert activities, and they sent a group to Cernăuţi, Romania to seek out escape routes. It was only after Abba Kovner, and his group from Vilna joined, along with Icchak Cukierman, who had headed the Jewish Combat Organization of the Polish uprising of August 1944, in January 1945, that the organization took shape. They soon joined up with a similar effort led by the Jewish Brigade and eventually the Haganah (the Jewish clandestine army in Palestine).\n\nOfficers of the Jewish Brigade of the British army assumed control of the operation, along with operatives from the Haganah who hoped to smuggle as many displaced persons as possible into Palestine through Italy. The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee funded the operation.\n\nAlmost immediately, the explicitly Zionist Berihah became the main conduit for Jews coming to Palestine, especially from the displaced person camps, and it initially had to turn people away due to too much demand.\n\nAfter the Kielce pogrom of 1946, the flight of Jews accelerated, with 100,000 Jews leaving Eastern Europe in three months. Operating in Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia through 1948, Berihah transferred approximately 250,000 survivors into Austria, Germany, and Italy through elaborate smuggling networks. Using ships supplied at great cost by the Mossad Le'aliyah Bet, then the immigration arm of the Yishuv, these refugees were then smuggled through the British cordon around Palestine. Bricha was part of the larger operation known as Aliyah Bet, and ended with the establishment of Israel, after which \"immigration\" to the Jewish state was legal, although \"emigration\" was still sometimes prohibited, as happened in both the Eastern Bloc and Arab countries, see, for example refusenik.\n\n\n\n"}

The book was first published in October 2001 by the Delacorte Press, and it was later reprinted in May 2003 by Dell-Laurel Leaf, an imprint of a division of Random House, Inc. The book has become a bestseller, and is included in the required reading lists of many American high schools.\n\n\nThe part of the story taking place in England where Johnny's father has enlisted is told mainly through letters sent back home to his family. Through the letters it is possible to tell that the November 25 until December 26, 1914. At the beginning of the book Johnny and his family live in London, however Johnny is sent to live with his Aunt Ivy in the town of Cliffe soon after his father enlists. His mother moves to the town of Woolwich, also sending letters to Johnny every chapter, to help support the war by getting a job making weaponry in a factory.\n\nA main theme of the book is the pointlessness and irrationality of war. After the protagonist, Johnny Briggs, misses school for two days in order to have more time to build his Guy Fawkes, he is forced to spend every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon at his teacher's house. There, his teacher, Mr. Tuttle, tutors him on classic literature, mainly the \"Iliad\". They both draw direct parallels between the events of World War I and the events of Homer's novel.\n\nIt is during the beginning of the book that he is bullied, but when saved by Sarah is entirely ungrateful and says \"a girl for a friend is like no friend at all.\" This is why he leaves the school. When she saves him from being thrown in the fire he starts to see her as a friend.\n\nAt the beginning of the book, Johnny's father appears enthusiastic about going to war, so much that at the beginning he is frustrated that he lacks the half-inch of height required to enlist. After the required height is lowered, he joins the war and is moved to the front line afterward. As the war continues, it takes its toll on Johnny's father's health, physique, and mentality. Johnny's father sends his son a newly whittled and painted soldier with every letter, but his creations appear increasingly grotesque throughout the book. This is reflected in the model of himself that he had sent. The brown paint of his clothes turns a moldy green, the wide grin on its face fades to a grim, mournful expression, a hairline crack comes down his chest, and a knothole begins to form in its chest.\n\nThe book comes to a close when Johnny stops playing with his nutcracker soldiers, and brings them together for the Christmas Truce of 1914. The war continues without Johnny's interference, and his father returns four years later in 1918. Johnny's mother dies from sulfur poisoning in 1923, demonstrating that some of the most valiant sacrifices of World War I came not from the front lines, but from the work force at home.\n\nMost people rate it a 4-5/5. This is because people say that this book's contents of the story is interesting and thrilling.\n"}

{"id": "2191916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191916", "title": "Budweiser trademark dispute", "text": "Budweiser trademark dispute\n\nThe Budweiser trademark dispute is an ongoing series of legal disputes between two beer companies (from the Czech Republic and the United States) who claim trademark and geographic origin rights to the name \"Budweiser\". The dispute has been ongoing since 1907, and has involved more than 100 court cases around the world. As a result, Budweiser Budvar has the rights to the name Budweiser in most of Europe and Anheuser-Busch InBev has this right in North America. Consequently, AB InBev uses the name \"Bud\" in most of Europe and Budvar sells its beer in North America under the name \"Czechvar\". In other territories, one or other or even both may use the name, depending on local trademark law.\n\nBeer brewing in the city of České Budějovice (), which was then in the Kingdom of Bohemia and is now in the Czech Republic, dates back to the 13th century, when the city was granted brewing rights during the reign of Ottokar II of Bohemia. During the time when both Czech and German were official languages in the kingdom, two breweries were founded in the city. Both breweries made beer which they called \"Budweiser\", similar to how brewers in the city of Pilsen made a beer generically called Pilsner. The beer from Budweis began exporting to the United States in 1872–73 and then again since 1933. In 1876, the American brewer Anheuser-Busch began making a beer which they also called \"Budweiser\", motivated in part by a desire to \"brew a beer similar in quality, color, flavor and taste to the beer then made at Budweis\", according to Adolphus Busch.\n\nTwo breweries currently claim rights to the word \"Budweiser\":\nIn addition, Budweiser Bier Bürgerbräu () was founded in 1795 by German-speaking citizens of Budweis, and began exporting beer under the \"Budweiser Bier\" name to the United States in 1875. The company was expropriated by the state in 1945, and abandoned use of the Budweiser name at that time. However, after the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia, the government restored the company's rights in Czechoslovakia. The parent company of Budweiser Bier Bürgerbräu, Samson, was acquired by AB InBev in 2014, in part to help support AB InBev's claim to the Budweiser mark.\n\nAnheuser-Busch cites prior registration of the trademark in the United States, and more recently its ownership of Budweiser Bier Bürgerbräu, when making a claim to the mark. Anheuser-Busch has also pointed to advertising campaigns where those predated any formal registration by either party, such as an extensive campaign in the 1930s in Italy that predated Budvar's 1940 registrations. The Budweis-based companies have argued in turn that Budweiser is generic, or is a protected geographical indication that refers to beer made specifically in the city of Budweis. Where possible, Budvar's claims are supported by proof of prior use (as in Germany).\n\nContracts between Anheuser-Busch and the two Czech breweries in 1911 and 1939 have also factored into some of the cases. These contracts allegedly gave Anheuser the right to use Budweiser as a \"trade name or trade mark\" while giving the European companies the right to use Budweiser \"as descriptive of geographical origin\".\n\nIn the European Union, the cases have led to several court rulings about the nature and scope of protected geographical indications (also known as \"appellations of origin\"). In Italy, courts found that an appellation could be valid even if the place to which the case referred no longer exists (in this case, the city of Budweis, now Budějovice), which gave Budvar's brand protection in Italy. In a case originating in Austria, the European Court of Justice ruled that simple indications (in this case \"Bud\") could not be prohibited if a more specific appellation was protected, therefore allowing AB InBev to sell \"Bud\" in Austria, but not \"Budweiser\".\n\nIn 1907, American and Bohemian brewers made an agreement that Anheuser-Busch could market its beer as Budweiser only in North America, while the Bohemian brewers had the rights to the European markets. Since then, litigation has been extensive: according to the Budvar website, as of 2012 there were \"about 40 trademark dispute cases pending in different jurisdictions and some 70 procedural issues up for consideration around the world\". \n\nAs of January 2013, Budvar claimed to have won 89 of 124 cases against AB InBev, with an additional eight ending in a draw or settlement.\n\nIn the European Union (EU), Budějovický Budvar is recognized as a product with Protected Geographical Indication. However, the trademark rights to the name Budweiser for some products other than beer are owned by Anheuser-Busch.\n\nIn early 2007, Anheuser-Busch and Budvar reached an agreement that stated that Anheuser-Busch would market Budvar/Czechvar in the United States and several other countries for an undisclosed fee. However, both sides stated that this did not affect their lawsuits. The partnership with AB InBev was terminated in January 2012, and in July of that year, United States Beverage began responsibility for the sales and marketing of Czechvar in the United States.\n\nIn March 2009, Anheuser-Busch lost an appeal against the EU's Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) decision to reject the registration of \"Budweiser\" as an EU-wide trademark for beer for Anheuser-Busch. The court pointed out that Budějovický Budvar had proven that it had been using the trade mark during at least the five years preceding the publication of Anheuser-Busch's application for a Community trade mark. The decision also covers malted non-alcoholic beverages (such as non-alcoholic beer). \n\nSome recent cases include:\n\nWhere AB InBev has lost cases, it markets its product as \"Bud\" (as in Italy) or as \"Anheuser-Busch B\" (in Germany). In 2013, AB InBev was granted an EU-wide Community Trade Mark for the use of \"Bud\", after winning a related court case against Budvar.\n\nWhere Budvar does not have rights, such as the United States, Canada, and Brazil, it uses the brand name Czechvar. In 2007, AB InBev signed a deal with Budvar to sell Budvar Budweiser under the name Czechvar in the United States. The partnership was terminated in January 2012, and in July of that year, United States Beverage began responsibility for the sales and marketing of Czechvar in the United States.\n\n"}
{"id": "2191918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191918", "title": "Dihydrogen bond", "text": "Dihydrogen bond\n\nIn chemistry, a dihydrogen bond is a kind of hydrogen bond, an interaction between a metal hydride bond and an OH or NH group or other proton donor. With a van der Waals radius of 1.2 Å, hydrogen atoms do not usually approach other hydrogen atoms closer than 2.4 Å. Close approaches near 1.8 Å, are, however, characteristic of dihydrogen bonding.\nAn early example of this phenomenon is credited to Brown and Heseltine. They observed intense absorptions in the IR bands at 3300 and 3210 cm for a solution of (CH)NHBH. The higher energy band is assigned to a normal N−H vibration whereas the lower energy band is assigned to the same bond, which is interacting with the B−H. Upon dilution of the solution, the 3300 cm band increased in intensity and the 3210 cm band decreased, indicative of intermolecular association.\n\nInterest in dihydrogen bonding was reignited upon the crystallographic characterization of the molecule HNBH. In this molecule, like the one studied by Brown and Hazeltine, the hydrogen atoms on nitrogen have a partial positive charge, denoted H, and the hydrogen atoms on boron have a partial negative charge, often denoted H. In other words, the amine is a protic acid and the borane end is hydridic. The resulting B−HH−N attractions stabilize the molecule as a solid. In contrast, the related substance ethane, HCCH, is a gas with a boiling point 285 °C lower. Because two hydrogen centers are involved, the interaction is termed a dihydrogen bond. Formation of a dihydrogen bond is assumed to precede formation of H from the reaction of a hydride and a protic acid. A very short dihydrogen bond is observed in NaBH·2HO with H−H contacts of 1.79, 1.86, and 1.94 Å.\n\n Protonation of transition metal hydride complexes is generally thought to occur via dihydrogen bonding. This kind of H−H interaction is distinct from the H−H bonding interaction in transition metal complexes having dihydrogen bound to a metal.\n\nSo-called hydrogen hydrogen bond interactions have been proposed to occur between two neutral non-bonding hydrogen atoms from Atoms in molecules theory, while similar interactions have been shown to exist experimentally. Many of these types of dihydrogen bonds have been identified in molecular aggregates.\n"}

It features the original band members and the final line-up of the band performing at their show in Bloomington, Indiana on June 29, 2010.\n\nThe band released a picture on January 20, 2014 of a date-stamped white board reading \"setlist\" and on January 29, 2014 a new band website was created to allow visitors to sign up for email updates.\n\nOn February 14, 2014 it was announced that Haste the Day would reform for one night on May 2, 2014 with its original lineup to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the album \"Burning Bridges\".\n\nThe band later announced that they would be recording a new album with some of the original members and some of the \"Attack of the Wolf King\" line-up. On August 15, 2014, the band started an Indiegogo campaign to help fund the new album. Their monetary goal was surpassed. Vocalist Stephen Keech was announced to produce the album, with Matt Goldman doing the mixing. Another announcement set the album's release by Solid State Records on May 19, 2015.\n\nOn April 23, 2015, \"World\", the lead single from \"Coward\", was released online, while the album was released on May 18, 2015. The band has since scheduled four shows across the U.S.\n\nAccording to a photo posted May 28, 2015 by the band on their Facebook page, the album \"Coward\" was fiftieth overall on Billboard charts, second on Christian charts, seventh on Hard Rock charts, sixteenth on Rock charts, and seventh on the Internet overall.\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\n\n"}

Each campus is designated St Vincent's Private Hospital, and the suburb (Fitzroy/East Melbourne/Kew/Werribee ). The private hospital was owned by the catholic Sisters of Charity and the Sisters of Mercy, as a result of a joint venture that commenced in 1998. The merger, of facilities owned by two different religious orders, was the first of its kind. The facility is now owned by the catholic Sisters of Charity.\n\nThe Sisters of Charity and Sisters of Mercy, had run the St Vincent's Private and Mercy Private hospitals independently, for more than 70 years before merging.\n\nSt Vincent's Private Hospital purchased Vimy House Private Hospital in 2008, creating the third campus. Werribee was purpose built and opened in January 2018 with 112 beds and 4 operating theatres. Currently across the four sites, St Vincent's Private Melbourne has a capacity of over 600 beds.\n\nMajor specialities include interventional cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery, obstetrics, neurosurgery and orthopaedics, paediatrics, ENT, hand surgery, oncology and general surgery.\n\nSt Vincent's Private Hospital also runs a comprehensive social accountability program. Approximately 300 meals per week are supplied to St Mary's House of Welcome and The Wellington Community Centre. The hospital funds an ACU scholarship for nursing students of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander heritage, and provides two scholarships for refugee children in the community to complete their education at a local private College. The hospital provides support to the Children First Foundation, Mercy Care and The Way. Staff are also given the opportunity to apply for community leave in order to undertake volunteer service in a charity.\n\n"}
{"id": "2191926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191926", "title": "Neroli", "text": "Neroli\n\nNeroli oil is an essential oil produced from the blossom of the bitter orange tree (\"Citrus aurantium subsp. amara\" or \"Bigaradia\"). Its scent is sweet, honeyed and somewhat metallic with green and spicy facets. Orange blossom is also extracted from the same blossom and both extracts are extensively used in perfumery. Orange blossom can be described as smelling sweeter, warmer and more floral than neroli. The difference between how neroli and orange blossom smell and why they are referred to with different names, is a result of the process of extraction that is used to obtain the oil from the blooms. Neroli is extracted by steam distillation and orange blossom is extracted via a process of enfleurage (rarely used nowadays due to prohibitive costs) or solvent extraction.\n\nThe blossoms are gathered, usually by hand, in late April to early May. The oil is extracted by steam distillation. Tunisia is the largest producer of neroli oil followed by Morocco.\n\nBy the end of the 17th century, Anne Marie Orsini, duchess of Bracciano and princess of Nerola, Italy, introduced the essence of bitter orange tree as a fashionable fragrance by using it to perfume her gloves and her bath. Since then, the term \"neroli\" has been used to describe this essence. Neroli has a refreshing and distinctive, spicy aroma with sweet and flowery notes.\n\nIt is one of the most widely used floral oils in perfumery. Like all essential oils neroli is irritating, sensitizing and a known allergen because of the high content of aromatic terpenes such as linalool, limonene, farnesol, geraniol and citral. It blends well with any citrus oil, various floral absolutes, and most of the synthetic components available on the market. Neroli oil is a classic element in fragrance design and one of the most commonly used in the industry.\n\nIt also has a limited use in flavorings. Neroli oil is reportedly one of the ingredients in the closely guarded secret recipe for the Coca-Cola soft drink. It is a flavoring ingredient of open source cola recipes, although some variants consider it as optional, owing to the high cost.\n\n\n"}

Their debut, \"Son, I Loved You at Your Darkest\", was released in 2005. Two years later, they released \"Come Now Sleep\". Then, in 2009, As Cities Burn released their third album, \"Hell or High Water\". The band had performed from 2011 through 2016, but drummer Aaron Lunsford announced, on August 16, 2016, that the group disbanded. In December 2017, As Cities Burn reunited and went on tour to open up for Emery, and announced that they were staying together and writing new music.\n\nAs an unsigned act, the group drew the attention of Solid State Records, an imprint of Tooth & Nail Records, which signed them in 2004.\n\nThey released their first full-length album, \"Son, I Loved You at Your Darkest\" on June 21, 2005, and was featured in Solid State's Young Bloods Tour with The Chariot, Showbread, and He Is Legend. In 2006 they toured with The Bled, Protest The Hero and Sincebyman. They held two CD release shows for this album: June 21 at Covington in Louisiana, LA and June 22 at Vinos in Little Rock, AR.\n\n\"Son, I Loved You at Your Darkest\" had mostly a post-hardcore sound. The album contained heavy screaming by front man TJ Bonnette, with back-up vocals from his younger brother Cody Bonnette. A dark, dramatic, and emotional sound was consistent throughout the record. \"The Widow\" (clean vocals by Cody) was a hint of what As Cities Burn would later sound like without the screaming of TJ.\n\nOn June 10, 2006, the band announced the end of As Cities Burn, but in early July — after an outpouring of support from fans — decided to remain together. The band's final concert was to be on August 19, 2006 at the House of Blues in New Orleans, LA. However, soon afterwards the band decided they would remain together and record a new album.\n\nIn summer 2006, on what was to be their last tour, they parted ways with bassist Pascal Barone, shortly after their announcement that they were staying together. For the remainder of the tour they performed with Robert Chisolm, singer of the band Jonezetta. After the tour they returned home to record a new album, with current guitarist Colin Kimble playing bass.\n\nOn December 17 (midnight of December 16), the band released a demo on MySpace and PureVolume of a new track from their upcoming album, which they recorded in early 2007. It surprised fans due to its complete lack of screaming, which had been the dominant vocal style on their previous releases. The change of vocal styling was a result of TJ Bonnette, As Cities Burn's original vocalist with a screaming style, leaving the band in pursuit of building his relationship with his wife, who lived three hours away. Guitarist Cody, who had sung the clean vocals previously, took over vocals entirely. TJ played one final show with As Cities Burn at the end of January in 2007 at the Highground venue in Metarie.\n\nAs Cities Burn spent February and March 2007 recording their newest album. On April 12, 2007, As Cities Burn released the title of their second album, \"Come Now Sleep\". The album was released August 14, 2007. On June 8 at 12:00 am, the song \"This Is It, This Is It\" was posted on their MySpace and PureVolume profile. On July 2, a second song, \"Empire\", was added onto their PureVolume page. From August 7 to 9, the album was made available for streaming on the band's MySpace account. On August 14, 2007, \"Come Now Sleep\" hit the shelves.\n\nIn spring of 2008, As Cities Burn posted in a bulletin on MySpace that they would be at home writing the new album. They recorded the album in summer of 2008. On September 7, 2008, they posted another bulletin that they were \"about three weeks\" from completing the new record. It was also said to \"expect more of the direction (they) began heading in with \"Come Now Sleep\",\" and that Cody, and their friend Tyler Orr were recording the record almost entirely by themselves. On January 2, 2009, the band posted a new recording entitled \"Gates\" on their MySpace page, which was a song the band had played numerous times at the end of live sets. On January 10, at their Texas show, they debuted \"'84 Sheepdog\". On March 30, \"'84 Sheepdog\" was posted on their MySpace page. Starting April 2, a new track was posted every Monday up to the release of the album. The songs posted were \"Into the Sea\", \"Pirate Blues\", and \"Errand Rum\". The \"Hell or High Water\" album was released on April 21.\n\nIn an interview in HM Magazine, Cody Bonnette stated, \"The dream is to never break up, eventually start to suck more and more, and fade away.\" However, on July 15, 2009, As Cities Burn announced on their MySpace page that they had broken up. They released the following statement:\n\nChris Lott went on to play guitar for Twin Killers.\nCody Bonnette and Aaron Lunsford have started a new band called Hawkboy, and toured with Emery in the We Do What We Want Tour. Their sets involve covering As Cities Burn's music, as well a few new originals. Hawkboy has recorded a free EP that can be downloaded on iTunes, or accessed through their Facebook page.\n\nOn August 30, 2011, As Cities Burn updated their Facebook status saying \"Stay tuned for news regarding As Cities Burn\". The band made a Twitter account shortly thereafter, through which they tweeted \"Reunion show\" followed by the hashtag #silyayd, which is an abbreviation for their album \"Son, I Loved You at Your Darkest\". They announced that they would be playing the album in its entirety with TJ at Unsilent Night, a festival in Dallas, TX. Barone was not present on stage in Dallas, but instead Kimble remained on bass while Lott took Kimble's place on rhythm guitar. On February 6, 2012, the band announced via their Facebook page that they would also be playing the full album in Nashville and Baton Rouge in April.\n\nIn July 2012, they played a short tour with UK band The Elijah, including The Sugarmill, Stoke and Summerjam/Deadbolt Clubnight @ Zoo, Manchester.\n\nAccording to the band's Facebook page, the band is \"resurrected\".\n\nOn October 9, 2012, it was announced that As Cities Burn would be playing all dates of Underoath's Farewell Tour with MewithoutYou and Letlive in early 2013. It was also announced that Stephen Keech, former vocalist of well-known Christian metalcore group Haste the Day will be playing bass on the tour.\n\nOn June 1, 2015, the band released the music video for a new song, \"Prince of Planet Earth\", on YouTube.\n\nOn July 1, 2015, the band added another new song to YouTube, \"Goldmine\".\n\nOn August 3, 2016, the band added longtime touring member and Haste the Day vocalist, Stephen Keech to the lineup on bass and vocals. The band issued a statement on August 17, 2016 stating the band had ended, \"this time for good\", and cancelled remaining performances, with apologies to ticket-holders.\n\nOn December 6, 2017, the band announced a tour with Emery via their Facebook page, along with the message \"WE ARE BACK\". On July 31, 2018, it was announced that As Cities Burn would join Silverstein for their 15-year anniversary tour of their album, When Broken Is Easily Fixed, with Hawthorne Heights and Capstan from November 9 – December 15, 2018.\n\nOn November 8, 2018, the band released their first single in three years, \"2020 AD\", and announced that they signed to Equal Vision Records.\n\n\nFormer\n\nStudio albums\nEPs\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2191954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2191954", "title": "Lennox–Gastaut syndrome", "text": "Lennox–Gastaut syndrome\n\nLennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a complex, rare, and severe childhood-onset epilepsy. It is characterized by multiple and concurrent seizure types, cognitive dysfunction, and slow spike waves on electroencephalogram (EEG). Typically, it presents in children aged 3–5 years and can persist into adulthood. It has been associated with several gene mutations, perinatal insults, congenital infections, brain tumors/malformations, and genetic disorders such as tuberous sclerosis and West syndrome. The prognosis for LGS is poor with a 5% mortality in childhood and persistent seizures into adulthood (80%–90%).\n\nLGS was named for neurologists William G. Lennox (Boston, USA) and Henri Gastaut (Marseille, France), who independently described the condition. The international LGS Awareness Day is on November 1.\nThe symptoms vary and progress with age. The symptoms are characterized by a triad of seizures, cognitive dysfunction, and EEG findings. The triad may not fully emerge until 1–2 years after first seizure episode.\n\nThe peak age of onset of seizures is typically between 3 and 5 years of age. The mainstay symptoms is seizures that are frequent – occurring daily – and difficult to treat with antiseizure medications. An estimated 30% of patients with infantile spasms (West syndrome) have been reported to progress to LGS.\n\nThe seizures are most commonly tonic seizures. They occur most frequently during non-REM sleep (90%). The seizures initially last only a few seconds and are activated by sleep. The presentation can be subtle. They present often as tonic eyelid opening with some changes in breathing coupled with pupillary dilation, urinary incontinence, increased heart rate, and flushing can occur.\n\nNonconvulsive status epilepticus occurs in about 50% of patients. The seizures can cause sudden falling often leading to injury. These \"drop attacks\" are typically the first manifestation of LGS. The attacks are characterized by a single, generalized monoclonic jerk that precedes tonic contraction of axial muscles.\n\nFindings that strongly suggest LGS include consistent slow spike-wave (< 3 hertz [Hz]) on awake EEG. The complexes typically consist of a spike (duration < 70 milliseconds) or a sharp wave (70-200 milliseconds), followed first by a positive deep trough, then a negative wave (350-400 milliseconds). Not every wave is preceded by a spike. Bursts increase and decrease without clear onset and offset. Slow spike waves may occur during seizure or between seizures, or may occur in absence of any observable clinical changes which helps distinguish pattern from extended 3-Hz spike-wave discharges.\n\nOcular abnormalities affect around 90% of children. They can present as refractive error, strabismus, cortical visual impairment, and premature retinopathy.\n\nThe disease pathophysiology is mostly unknown, but some evidence implicates cortical hyperexcitability occurring at critical periods of brain development.\n\nThere are two types of LGS: idiopathic and secondary. The cause of the idiopathic subtype is unknown. Secondary LGS occurs when an identifiable underlying pathology is responsible. The most common type of LGS (70–78%) is secondary. These patients tend to have a worse prognosis than those with idiopathic LGS. In up to one-third of cases no cause can be found.\n\nLennox-Gastaut most often occurs secondary to brain damage. The brain damage can occur from perinatal insults, encephalitis, meningitis, tumor, and brain malformation.\n\nOther identified disorders include genetic disorders such as tuberous sclerosis and inherited deficiency of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase. Some of these cases once thought to be of unknown cause may have definitive etiology by modern genetic testing.\n\nProgress in genome and exome sequencing is revealing that some individuals diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome have de novo mutations in a variety of genes, including CHD2, GABRB3, ALG13 and SCN2A. The Epi4K study consortium (2013) observed de novo mutations in at least 15% of a study cohort of 165 patients with LGS and infantile spasms using whole exome sequencing. A 2013 study found a high frequency of rare copy-number variation (CNV's) in adult patients with LGS or LGS-like epilepsy.\n\nMutations in the IQSEC2 gene have been associated with this syndrome. This gene is located on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp11.22).\n\nThe diagnosis of LGS should be suspected in children less than 8 years old with seizures of multiple types that cannot be treated with antiseizure medications. Because of high risk of irreversible brain damage in early stages of syndrome (particularly in infants and young children), early diagnosis is essential. It may take 1–2 years after first initial seizure for all criteria for diagnosis to emerge, so LGS should be considered if there are suggestive signs and symptoms without presence of complete triad.\n\nTo confirm diagnosis, awake and asleep EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are performed. MRI is used to detect focal brain lesions.\n\nCertain diagnoses must be ruled out before diagnosing LGS. These diagnoses are:\n\n\nLGS is more easily distinguished from Doose syndrome by seizure type after the syndrome has progressed. Doose syndrome has more myoclonic seizures and LGS has more tonic seizures. The Doose syndromes is less likely to have cognitive disabilities.\n\nThe Dravet syndrome has a strong family history of epilepsy, unlike LGS. Also, many children with Dravet syndrome have seizures triggered by light.\n\nPseudo-Lennox–Gastaut syndrome can be distinguished from LGS because pseudo-LGS has different spike-and-wave patterns on EEG.\n\nThere are several treatment options, including medications, surgery, and diet.\n\nIn most patients with LGS, the treatment does not end seizure recurrence. The goals of treatment are to lower frequency and severity of seizures to greatest extent possible. The appropriate treatment varies depending on individual.\n\nThe treatments for LGS has evolved over the years. Various treatments have been shown to have some degree of efficacy. In 1997-1999, lamotrigine was found to be effective and approved by the Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada. In 1999, topiramate trials showed that topiramate decreased seizure occurrence by more than 50%.\n\nFelbamate is the treatment of last resort in the event that everything else fails, and was found to be superior to placebo in controlling treatment resistant partial seizures and atonic seizures. However, it has been known to cause aplastic anemia and liver toxicity.\n\n\n\nThird-line drugs\n\n\nTreatment of last resort\n\n\n\nIn the past, LGS patients were not eligible for surgery, as the medical community thought the LGS involved the whole brain as a generalized epilepsy in all cases. Since 2010, this assumption has been challenged. Two studies on LGS patients series who underwent curative surgery in Korea and China, showed very good results, up to seizure freedom for 80% of these patients below 5 years old, and 40% above 5 years old. Like all epilepsy curative surgeries, seizures may recur in the years following surgery, but surgery allows the child to have better brain development during the seizure free period.\n\nThere are several procedures that have shown efficacy:\n\n\nA ketogenic diet is a diet that causes ketosis, a state in which there is an increased amount of ketones in the body. Adopting and maintaining rigid diet may be difficult for some families. Short-term ketogenic diet might be associated with nonsignificant decreases in frequency of parent-reported seizures in children with LGS. A case series study showed 50% seizure reduction reported in almost half of children with LGS after 1 year of ketogenic diet. However, the strength of the study is challenged because it represents reports rather than scientific analysis of the clinical outcomes such as in a randomized controlled trial.\n\nThe mortality rate ranges from 3–7% in a mean follow up period of 8.5 to 9.7 years. Death is often related to accidents.\n\nLGS is seen in approximately 4% of children with epilepsy, and is more common in males than in females. Usual onset is between the ages of three and five. Children can have no neurological problems prior diagnosis, or have other forms of epilepsy. West syndrome is diagnosed in 20% of patients before it evolves into LGS at about 2 years old.\n\nAccording to a 1997 community-based retrospective study in the Helsinki metropolitan area and the province of Uusimaa, the annual incidence of Lennox–Gastaut was 2 in 100,000 (0.002%) from 1975 to 1985.\n\n0.026% of all children in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area were estimated to have LGS in 1997, which was defined as, \"onset of multiple seizure types before age 11 years, with at least one seizure type resulting in falls, and an EEG demonstrating slow spike-wave complexes (<2.5 Hz).\" The study concluded that LGS accounts for 4% of childhood epilepsies.\n\nVigabatrin was found by Feucht et al. to be an effective add-on in patients whose seizures were not satisfactorily controlled by valproate. Out of 20 children, only 1 experienced a serious side effect (dyskinesia).\n\nZonisamide showed promise in an overview of controlled and uncontrolled trials conducted in Japan. However, in a physician survey conducted December 2004, only 28% of Lennox–Gastaut and West syndrome patients improved on zonisamide.\n\nOne yet to be published study from 2017 supported the use of cannabidiol.\n\nA study published in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" has shown a significant reduction of seizures in patients taking 10 and 20 mg/kg a day compared to placebo.\n"}

Dreamt Music focuses more on Christian Alternative and Classic Rock unlike its Christian Metal counterparts Facedown and Strike First Records. See Dreamt Artists for list of Dreamt Music signed artists.\n\nThe label also hosts an annual two-day \"Facedown Fest\" in southern California. The festival is usually made up of the entire Facedown and Strike First rosters. It has been the site of final performances by The Deal, xDisciplex A.D., and xDEATHSTARx, Seventh Star, and served as the introduction of xLooking Forwardx to Facedown fans, prior to the band signing with the label. The popularity of the Fest has grown, and in November 2005, an additional two days were held in Annapolis, Maryland for the convenience of those in the eastern part of the U.S. who cannot easily make it to California. For 2017's Facedown Fest, and to celebrate their 20th anniversary, the label is hosting the festival as a three-day event, with old acts such as A Plea for Purging, Bloodlined Calligraphy and xLooking Forwardx and new acts such as Nothing Left and Comrades. The 20th anniversary had many notable acts, including Impending Doom, Sinai Beach, Gideon, Hands and War of Ages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is sometimes confused with his son, another Texas state legislator who was also known as William Clark Jr. (18281884).\n\nClark was born in North Carolina on April 14, 1798. He married Martha B. Wall in the 1820s. They had a son named William Clark Junior in 1828. They lived in Georgia before moving to Sabine County, Texas in 1835, where he operated a successful store. William S Clark Junior and James Gaines both traveled to the Convention of 1836. This Convention was brought together to discuss a possible secession and war with Mexico. This created the Texas Declaration of Independence, which both Clark and Gaines signed. Following the convention, interim President David G Burnet of the Republic of Texas, was assisted by Clark by creating a system to collect supplies and other goods for the army to fight against the invading Mexican army. \n\nClark briefly served as a representative of Sabine County in the House of the Second Congress in 1837 and left in 1838 due to illness. Following the war, and after recovering from his illness, he stayed in Sabine County until he purchased the Planter Hotel in Nacogdoches in 1859, located in East Texas. He managed the property until he died on January 3, 1871. In 1936, the Texas Centennial Commission built a marker on the last Clarks’ home as well as on the graves of Clark and his wife Martha.\n\nWilliam S Clark Junior had a son named William Clark Junior. William Clark Junior followed in his father’s footsteps, as he was elected to the state legislature in 1859, and helped Texas in the Secession Convention of 1861, leading Texas into the American Civil War.\n"}

The band has stated on multiple occasions that they are named after Mount Sinai, where Moses was given the Ten Commandments in the Bible.\n\nSinai Beach was started by vocalist CJ Alderson, guitarist Logan Lambert, drummer Mike Dunlap, and bassist Jeff Santo. They recorded a four-song demo and played mostly local shows. Their recording and performances gained attention of No Innocent Victim drummer, Jason Dunn. Shortly after signing with Dunn's label, Facedown Records, guitarist Mike Risinger joined on guitar. The five began to write material for their second recording that became the band's first full release, \"When Breath Escapes\". Vocalist CJ Alderson appeared on Zao's \"The Lesser Lights of Heaven\" DVD.\n\nAs the fan base and support continued to grow Sinai Beach started to receive interest from several well-known heavy music labels and eventually signed with Chicago-based Victory Records. This allowed them the opportunity to tour with bands such as Zao, As I Lay Dying, Norma Jean, Haste the Day, Still Remains, Himsa, Bleeding Through, Comeback Kid and Terror. After several US and European tours, Sinai Beach released their second full album \"Immersed\".\n\nSinai Beach is listed as \"Artist Alumni\" on the Victory Records website and several of the members have moved away and married since the band last played together live. Sean Durham and Erik Collins both joined the band in 2006 following the departure of Santo and the brief hiatus of Risinger. Dunlap and Lambert still reside in the Riverside area, while Risinger, Durham and Collins are in the surrounding area. Alderson moved to North Carolina in 2009.\n\nIn 2013, it was announced the band would headline at Facedown Festival on March 28, 2014, where the band announced their \"resurrection\". In 2017, Lambert did an interview with Indie Vision Music, in which he stated that the band was done, though no official statement was released. He said that the reunion at Facedown Fest was their last show.\n\nEarly influences of the band include Overcome, Zao, Strongarm, Throwdown, and Living Sacrifice. But the members have stated that influences changed in later years to include Black Label Society, The Cult and Pantera, although have admitted in times past that they are heavily into death metal bands such as Suffocation, Nile, and Aborted.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its studios are located at the La Verdad Christian College - Caloocan Building, 351 EDSA, Brgy. Bagong Barrio West, Caloocan City. Its transmitter is located at Emerald Hills, Sumulong Highway, Antipolo City.\n\nIn July 2001, the Progressive Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) owned by businessman Alfredo \"Atom\" Henares ventured into UHF television through UNTV 37 (pronounced as \"un-tee-vee\"). It serves as television counterpart to PBC's FM radio station NU 107, airing rock and alternative rock music videos. The station gained a cult following through comedy and reality show Strangebrew known as \"Ang show na may tama\" and \"In the Raw.\"\n\nIn 2004, UNTV gradually reduced, until it eventually abandoned airing rock-oriented music videos after its airtime were acquired by Tapatan, Inc. headed by veteran broadcaster Jay Sonza. The station also began airing MCGI religious programs after Henares had a deal with the \"Ang Dating Daan\" group. Since then, UNTV became the permanent home of the religious program Ang Dating Daan (The Old Path) after leaving SBN 21. Later, the station was rebranded as \"UN Television (UNTV)\" (pronounced as \"you-en-tee-vee.\")\n\nThe new UNTV humbly started with a one-room broadcast studio located at the AIC Gold Tower in Ortigas Center, Pasig City. \nThe station transferred to Brgy.

The tower is shared by UNTV and Wish FM 107.5.\n\nOn June 26, 2014, UNTV held the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of UNTV Broadcast Center, that will serve as its new headquarters.

Also known as a \"Storey\". Generally, shop employees are not shopkeepers, but are often incorrectly referred to as shopkeepers. At larger companies, a shopkeeper is usually referred to as a manager, since the owner is not able to manage the business being a single shopkeeper, so this term could apply to larger firms (in particular, multiple shops) generally and be a separate duty.\n\nShopkeepers may manage their own independent corner shop or run a franchise store on behalf of a retail chain. Unlike store managers who usually work for a large retailer, shopkeepers will normally have overall responsibility for a store. Independent shopkeepers include (but are not limited to) grocers, corner shops, butchers, bakers, booksellers, florists, and antique dealers.\n\nA shopkeeper would serve clients at a counter and carry out other duties such as taking customer payments, giving change, helping customers and wrapping gifts and purchases. Most of the time shopkeepers are answering customer's enquirers, giving advice about products to customers and listening to customers’ needs and requests, which can indicate new sales opportunities. They also calculate daily takings, prepare pages, deposit cash at the bank, book-keep and stock take to ensure that the stocks are available all the time.\n\nOrdering stock from wholesalers, manufacturers, agents and importers, sometimes this task can also given to small shop keeper if the shop is too small and don't have purchaser.\n\nShop-keeping is a non-farm activity. Many people in the village owns a small shop and sells household products. People in the village do this work if they don't get work in the farm or for the daily income. In big cities, there are big-big malls instead of small shops.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2192013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192013", "title": "Bill Leak", "text": "Bill Leak\n\nDesmond Robert \"Bill\" Leak (9 January 1956 – 10 March 2017) was an Australian editorial cartoonist, caricaturist and portraitist.\n\nBrought up in Condobolin and Beacon Hill, Sydney, Leak attended the Julian Ashton Art School in the 1970s. His cartoons were first published in 1983 in \"The Bulletin\" and after he drew for \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" until 1994, when he was recruited by News Limited to contribute to \"The Daily Telegraph-Mirror\" and later to \"The Australian\".\nLeak entered paintings into the Archibald on several occasions, having won the People's Choice Award in 1994 for his portrait of Malcolm Turnbull and the Packing Room Prize twice, in 1997 and 2000 for his portraits of Tex Perkins and Sir Les Patterson respectively. Leak's novel \"Heart Cancer\" was published in 2005 and in 2008 ABC TV aired his six-part series \"Face Painting\".\nLeak's editorial cartoons for \"The Australian\" were at the centre of several controversies. Works that received considerable media coverage include a 2006 cartoon drawn during the West Papuan refugee crisis, a series of cartoons in 2007 that featured Kevin Rudd as Tintin, a 2015 cartoon depicting starving Indian people attempting to eat solar panels and two cartoons in 2016, one an illustration of a neglectful Aboriginal father and another that depicted same-sex marriage campaigners wearing rainbow-coloured Nazi uniforms.\n\nDesmond Robert Leak was born in Adelaide on 9 January 1956, the second of three children of Doreen and Reg Leak. He was brought up in Condobolin from his birth until 1967, when the family moved to Beacon Hill. He attended Beacon Hill High School and Forest High School, forced to leave the former for the latter after drawing caricatures of his teachers. Remembering what Beacon Hill was like in the early 1970s, Leak described the place as \"intellectually barren, culturally hostile and isolated\".\n\nAfter finishing high school, Leak trained for two years at the Julian Ashton Art School, dropping out before his studies were completed. He also spent time working as a postman. In the late 1970s, Leak departed Australia on an art pilgrimage to Europe. In 1978, he was particularly impressed by an exhibition of the paintings of Paul Cézanne at the Grand Palais in Paris. Whilst in Salzburg that same year, Leak met a woman named Astrid and they married soon after. The couple lived together in Bavaria until 1982, when they relocated to Australia. They divorced in the early 1990s.\n\nLeak began drawing cartoons professionally in 1983, first for \"The Bulletin\" and then for \"The Sydney Morning Herald\".\n\nLeak resigned from \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" to take up a role at \"The Daily Telegraph-Mirror\", a News Limited newspaper, in 1994. He later moved to \"The Australian\" (also a News Limited newspaper).\n\nIn April 2006, Leak drew a cartoon captioned \"No Offence Intended\", depicting an Indonesian person resembling then president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, as a dog mounting a Papuan native. The drawing was in retaliation to a \"Jakarta Daily\" cartoon from the previous week, which had depicted the Australian prime minister and foreign minister as dingoes engaged in sexual intercourse, with the prime minister saying \"I want Papua!! Alex! Try to make it happen!\" The foreign minister, Alexander Downer, told media that he felt Leak's cartoon was crude, offensive and potentially racist.\n\nIn 2007, a Belgian company that controlled the rights to the cartoon character Tintin, issued Leak a copyright complaint for portraying the then-leader of the opposition, Kevin Rudd, as Tintin (accompanied by Snowy). The complaint was resolved when Leak agreed not to profit from sales of the cartoons.\n\nA Leak cartoon published in \"The Australian\" in December 2015 depicted starving Indian villagers trying to eat solar panels delivered by the UN, a comment by Leak on the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference. The academic Amanda Wise, an associate professor of sociology at Macquaire University, told media that it was her view that the cartoon was racist. Social media commentary, including by Tim Watts, agreed with Wise and condemned the cartoon. The Australian Press Council dismissed a complaint about the cartoon, saying that \"the cartoon is an example of drawing on exaggeration and absurdity to make its point\" \"by ridiculing [the UN's] decision to provide solar panels at the expense of more appropriate aid\". The Australian Press Council delivered a ruling on the work in November 2016 that it did not breach standards of practice.\n\nIn August 2016, on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children's Day, a Leak cartoon in \"The Australian\" depicted an Aboriginal policeman holding a teenage male and telling the youth's father that he needed to teach his son about personal responsibility. The father, with a can of beer in hand, replies \"Yeah, righto, What's his name then?\" Muriel Bamblett, head of the Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency, as well as Roy Ah-See, chair of the NSW Aboriginal Land Council, and Nigel Scullion, the minister for Indigenous affairs, all labeled the cartoon racist. Western Australian Police Commissioner Karl O'Callaghan and academic Jeremy Sammut defended Leak's 2016 cartoon, saying it was an appropriate portrayal of some communities and families. Leak said the cartoon was not racist, reflecting that if the characters he had drawn were white, he would not have been accused of racially stereotyping all white parents as bad parents. A complaint by a woman who said she had been discriminated against as a result of the cartoon triggered an investigation into Leak and \"The Australian\" by the Australian Human Rights Commission. The complaint was later withdrawn after the woman behind the complaint was subjected to alleged intimidation and harassment from Leak's employers at News Limited. The investigation was thus terminated. \n\nOn 21 September 2016, during a nationwide debate about legalising same-sex marriage (SSM), \"The Australian\" published a Leak cartoon depicting a club-carrying, goose-stepping platoon, wearing rainbow-coloured NAZI SS uniforms, captioned \"Waffen-SSM\", which provoked significant controversy. Comedian Ben McLeay criticized Leak's cartoon, writing that it was harmful and morally repugnant. Peter Wertheim, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry executive director, said that the cartoon was an inversion of history.\n\nIn 1984, Leak first entered the Archibald Prize, an annual portraiture competition administered by the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

It was quickly repeated by his climbing partner, Luke Parady. These ascents were milestones for the young up and coming climbers and the Rumney area, as (at the time) they were at the cutting edge grade of physical difficulty in North America.\n\nThe Fly ascends a short, steep, lower portion of the Waimea wall, gaining a large ledge (the E-Ticket Ledge) and a bolted anchor about 25 feet up. The climb is very fingery and powerful.\n\nThe route is quite short by sport climbing standards, essentially a rope protected boulder problem, with its two protection bolts being placed before the now common use of many stacked 'crash pads' to protect the dangerous landing.

{"id": "2192043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192043", "title": "Kupala Night", "text": "Kupala Night\n\nKupala Night, (, ; ; ), called Ivanа-Kupala, is a traditional eastern Slavic holiday which is celebrated in Ukraine, Poland, Belarus and Russia during the night from 6 to 7 July (on the Gregorian calendar). (This corresponds to 23-24 June on these countries’ traditional Julian calendar.) Calendar-wise, it is opposite to the winter holiday Koliada. The celebration relates to the summer solstice when nights are the shortest and includes a number of Slavic rituals.\n\nThe name of the holiday was originally Kupala; a pagan fertility rite later adapted into the Orthodox Christian calendar by connecting it with St. John's Day which is celebrated on 24 June.\n\nThe Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian name of this holiday combines \"Ivan\" (John, in this case John the Baptist) and \"Kupala\" which is derived from the Slavic word for bathing, which is cognate. The two feasts could be connected by reinterpreting John's baptizing people through full immersion in water. However, the tradition of Kupala predates Christianity. The pagan celebration was adapted and reestablished as one of the native Christian traditions intertwined with local folklore.\n\nThe holiday is still enthusiastically celebrated by the younger people of Eastern Europe. The night preceding the holiday (\"Tvorila night\") is considered the night for \"good humour\" mischiefs (which sometimes would raise the concern of law enforcement agencies). On Ivan Kupala day itself, children engage in water fights and perform pranks, mostly involving pouring water over people.\n\nMany of the rites related to this holiday are connected with the role of water in fertility and ritual purification. This is due to the ancient Kupala rites.\n\nOn Kupala day, young people jump over the flames of bonfires in a ritual test of bravery and faith. The failure of a couple in love to complete the jump, while holding hands, is a sign of their destined separation.\n\nGirls may float wreaths of flowers (often lit with candles) on rivers, and attempt to gain foresight into their romantic relationship fortune from the flow patterns of the flowers on the river. Men may attempt to capture the wreaths, in the hope of capturing the interest of the woman who floated it.\n\nThere is an ancient Kupala belief that the eve of Ivan Kupala is the only time of the year when ferns bloom. Prosperity, luck, discernment, and power befall whom ever finds a fern flower. Therefore, on that night, village folk roam through the forests in search of \"magical\" herbs, and especially, the elusive \"fern flower\".\n\nTraditionally, unmarried women, signified by the garlands in their hair, are the first to enter the forest. They are followed by young men. Therefore, the quest to find herbs and the \"fern flower\" may lead to the blooming of relationships between pairs within the forest.\n\nFerns are not angiosperms (flowering plants), and instead reproduce by spores; they cannot flower.\n\nIn Gogol's story \"The Eve of Ivan Kupala\" a young man finds the fantastical fern-flower, but is cursed by it. Gogol's tale may have been the stimulus for Modest Mussorgsky to compose his tone poem \"Night on Bald Mountain\", adapted by Yuri Ilyenko into a film of the same name.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2192056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192056", "title": "Laxmi Prasad Devkota", "text": "Laxmi Prasad Devkota\n\nLaxmi Prasad Devkota (,(12 November 1909 – 14 September 1959) was a Nepali poet, playwright, and novelist. Honored with the title of Mahakavi (literal translation: \"The Great Poet\" or Poet the Great) in Nepali literature, and known as the poet with the golden heart. Devkota is by and large regarded as the great poet (महाकवि) of Nepali language. He is considered as the greatest and the most famous versatile literary figure of Nepal. Some of his popular works include the best selling \"Muna Madan\", along with \"Sulochana\", \"Kunjini\", \"Bhikhari\", and \"Shakuntal\".\n\nDevkota was born on the night of Lakshmi Pooja on 12 November 1909 (1966 Kartik 27 BS) to father Teel Madhav Devkota and mother Amar Rajyalakshmi Devi in Thatunati (now Dhobidhara), Kathmandu. His father, Teel Madhav was a Sanskrit scholar. So, He attained his basic education under the custodianship of his father. He started his education at Durbar High School in Kathmandu, where he studied both Sanskrit grammar and English. After finishing his Matriculation exams from Patna at the age of 17, He pursued the Bachelor of Arts along with the Bachelor of Laws at Tri Chandra College and graduated from Patna University as a private examinee. But his desire of completing his master's degree was left uncompleted due to his family's financial conditions. Only after a decade from his graduation as a lawyer, he started working in Nepal Bhasaanuwad Parishad (Publication Censor Board), where he met famous Playwright of Nepal Balkrishna Sama. At the same time, he also worked as a lecturer at Tri-Chandra College and Padma Kanya College.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Devkota suffered from nervous breakdowns, probably due to the death of his mother, father, and his two-month old daughter. Eventually, in 1939, he was admitted to the Mental Asylum of Rachi, India, for five months. Going into debt later in life to finance his daughters' dowries and weddings, he is reported to have said to his wife, \"Tonight let's abandon the children to the care of society and youth and I renounce this world at bedtime and take potassium cyanide or morphine or something like that.\"\n\nLaxmi Prasad Devkota was a chain smoker throughout his life. After a long battle with cancer, Devkota died on September 14, 1959, at the ghat of Bagmati River in Pashupatinath Temple, Kathmandu.\n\nLaxmi Prasad's son, Padma Devkota, is also a poet and writer and served for many years as a professor at the English Department, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu. \n\nDevkota contributed to Nepali literature by starting a modern Nepali language romantic movement in the country. Born in Nepal, he was the first to begin writing epic poems in Nepali literature. Nepali poetry soared to new heights with Devkota's innovative use of language.\n\nDeparting from the Sanskrit tradition that dominated the Nepali literary scene at the time, being inspired from the Newar language (a Sino-Tibetan language) ballad song Ji Waya La Lachhi Maduni, he wrote Muna Madan (1930), a long narrative poem in popular \"jhyaure bhaka\" folk tune. Muna Madan is undoubtedly the most sold book in the history of Nepalese literature. Being pictured as a movie, Muna Madan was able to get selected for the Oscar Award, which also signifies the level of the creation. The work received immediate recognition from the Ranas – the country's rulers at the time. Muna Madan tells the story of Madan—a travelling merchant—who departs from his wife Muna to Tibet in a bid to earn some money. The poem describes the thematic hardships of the journey: the grief of separation, the itching longing, and the torment of death.\n\nThe ballad Ji Waya La Lachhi Maduni is a tragic song based on a newa (original inhabitant of Nepal) merchant. There are three persons in the song, the merchant, his mother, and his wife. The merchant is about to leave Kathmandu for Tibet on work. The song starts with the wife pleading with her mother-in-law to stop him, saying that it's not even been a month since she came to their home and he wants to go away. Being raised in Kathmandu, Devkota heard this song from the locals singing it at the local pati (फल्चा in Nepali language). He was highly fascinated by the song and decided to re-write it in Nepali language. Since the Rana rulers had put a ban on the newa trade, language and literature, he changed the newa merchant character from the original song to a Kshatriya (warrior class) character. Although Kshatriya people do not practice trade those days for their living, he had to write in a way that lured the Rana rulers.\n\nThe following couplet, which is among the most famous and frequently quoted lines from the epic, celebrates the triumph of humanity and compassion over the hierarchies created by caste in Nepalese culture.\n<poem>\n\"क्षेत्रीको छोरो यो पाउ छुन्छ, घिनले छुँदैन\nमानिस ठूलो दिलले हुन्छ जातले हुँदैन ।\"\n</poem>\n\n<poem>\nA Kshatriya touches your feet not with hatred but with love.\nGreat is a man with a great heart; not with great caste, creed.\n</poem>\nConsidered his magnum opus, Muna Madan has remained widely popular among the lay readers of Nepali literature.\n\nLaxmi Prasad, inspired by his five-month stay in a mental asylum in 1939, wrote free-verse poem \"Pagal (The Lunatic)\".The poem deals with his usual mental ability and is considered one of the best Nepali language poems.\n<poem>\n\"जरुर साथी म पागल !\nयस्तै छ मेरो हाल ।\nम शब्दलाई देख्दछु !\nदृश्यलाई सुन्दछु !\nबासनालाई संबाद लिन्छु ।\nआकाशभन्दा पातालका कुरालाई छुन्छु ।\nती कुरा,\nजसको अस्तित्व लोक मान्दैंन\nजसको आकार संसार जान्दैन !\"\n</poem>\n<poem>\nSure, my friend, insane I am\nSuch is my plight.\nI visualize words\nbut hear the visible.\nfragrance I taste\nand the ethereal is palpable to me. \nThe things I touch--\nthe world denies their existence\nnor knows their shape\n</poem>\nDevkota had the ability to compose long epics and poems with literary complexity and philosophical density in very short periods of time. He wrote Shakuntala, his first epic poem and also the first \"Mahakavya\" (an epic poem) written in the Nepali language, in a mere three months. Published in 1945, Shakuntala is a voluminous work in 24 cantos based on Kālidāsa's famous Sanskrit play Abhijñānaśākuntalam. Shakuntala demonstrates Devkota's mastery of Sanskrit meter and diction which he incorporated heavily while working primarily in Nepali. According to the late scholar and translator of Devkota, David Rubin, Shakuntala is among his greatest accomplishments. \"It is, without doubt, a remarkable work, a masterpiece of a particular kind, harmonizing various elements of a classical tradition with a modern point of view, a pastoral with a cosmic allegory, Kalidasa's romantic comedy of earthly love with a symbolic structure that points to redemption through the coinciding of sensual and sacred love.\"\n\nDevkota also published several collections of short lyric poems set in various traditional and non-traditional forms and meters. Most of his poetry shows the influence of English Romantic Poets like Wordsworth and Coleridge. The title poem in the collection \"Bhikhari\" (\"Beggar\") is reminiscent of Wordsworth's \"The Old Cumberland Beggar\". In this poem, Devkota describes the beggar going about his ways in dire poverty and desolation, deprived of human love and material comforts. On the other hand, the beggar is also seen as the source of compassion placed in the core of suffering and destitution. Devkota connects the beggar with the divine as the ultimate fount of kindness and empathy:\n<poem>\n\"कालो बादलबाट खसेको\nअन्धकारमा भित्र बसेको,\nईश्वर हो कि भिखरी?\nघर, घर, आँगन चारी\nबोल्दछ, आर्तध्वनिमा बोल्दछ\nकरुणामृत दिल भारी ।\"\n</poem>\n\n<poem>\nFallen from the black clouds\nLiving in the darkness\nIs he the god or a beggar?\nHe wanders from house to house\nHe speaks in tunes suffused with pain\nA heart weighed with compassion.\n</poem>\nMany of his poems focus on mundane elements of the human and the natural world. The titles of his poems like \"Ban वन\" (\"Woods\"), \"Kisaan किसान\" (\"The Peasant\"), \"Baadal बादल\" (\"Clouds\") shows that he sought his poetic inspiration in the commonplace and proximal aspects of the world. What resonates throughout most of his poetry is his profound faith in humanity. For instance, in the poem \"Woods,\" the speaker goes through a series of interrogations, rejecting all forms of comfort and solace that could be offered solely to him as an individual. Instead, he embraces his responsibility and concern for his fellow beings. The poem ends with the following quatrain that highlights the speaker's humanistic inclinations:\n<poem>\n\"दोस्त कहाँ छन्? साथ छ को को? घर हो तिम्रो कुन देश?\nजान्छौ कुन पुर भवन मुसाफिर, ल्यायौ कुन सन्देश?\nदोस्त मेरो शुभ उद्योगी, साथ छ साहस बेश ।\nविश्व सबै घर, हृदय-पुरीतिर ल्याउछु सेवा सन्देश ।।\"\n</poem>\n\n<poem>\nWhere are your friends? Who goes with you? Which land is your home?\nWhat place do you seek, Traveler? With what news do you roam?\"\n\"My friend is decent diligence. Courage comes with me.\nwhole world's my home. To heart-land I roam with hues of Humanity\"\n</poem>\nBesides poetry, Devkota also made significant contributions to the essay genre. He is considered the father of the modern Nepali essay. He defied the conventional form of essays and broke the traditional rules of essay writing and embraced a more fluid and colloquial style which had more clarity in meaning, expressive in feelings and eloquent in terms of language. His essays are generally satirical in tone and are characterized by their trenchant humour and ruthless criticism of the modernizing influences from the West on Nepali society. An essay titled भलाद्मी (Bhaladmi) or \"Dignitary\" criticizes a decadent trend in Nepali society to respect people based on their outward appearances and outfit rather than their actual inner worth and personality. In another essay titled 'के नेपाल सानो छ?' (K Nepal Sano Cha?) \"Is Nepal insignificant (small)?\", he expresses deeply nationalistic sentiments inveighing against the colonial forces from British India which, he felt, were encroaching all aspects of Nepali culture. His essays are published in an essays book entitled Laxmi Nibhandha Sanghraha (लक्ष्मी निबन्धसङ्‌ग्रह).\n\nHe was a really god gifted person. He wrote khanda kabya (खण्डकाव्य) Sakuntala in only three months, in the time he could spare from full-time clerical work. His friends challenged him to do so If he could and he did it in about a week.\n\nLaxmi Prasad Devkota translated William Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\" into Nepali.\n\nLaxmi Prasad Devkota was not active in any well-established political party but his poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the oppressive Rana dynasty. During his self-exile in Varanasi, he started working as an editor of \"Yugvani\" newspaper of the Nepali Congress party, leading to confiscation of all his Nepali property by the Rana Government. After Introduction of democracy through Revolution of 1951, Devkota was appointed as a member of Nepal Shalakar Samiti in 1952 by King Tribhuvan. Later in 1957, he was appointed as Minister of Education and Autonomous Governance under the premiership of Kunwar Inderjit Singh.\n\n\n"}

Although it comes in various different forms, such practices are found in the magical traditions of many cultures across the world.\nAlthough the use of the term \"Voodoo\" implies that the practice has links to either the religion of Haitian Vodou or Louisiana Voodoo, in reality, it does not have a prominent place in either.\n\nThe form of the voodoo doll as it is most commonly understood is based on a magical practice that historically derived from Europe rather than Africa or the Americas.\nTextual records attest to the fact that certain cunning folk in Britain made dolls of a witch out of rags and other materials and then pierced them with pins with the intention of inflicting physical harm on the witch and breaking their bewitchment.\n\nThe link between this magical practice and Voodoo was established through the presentation of the latter in Western popular culture enduring the first half of the 20th century. In this, the myth of this magical practice being closely linked to Voodoo and Vodou was promoted as part of the wider negative depictions of blacks and Afro-Caribbean religious practices in the United States. In John Houston Craige's 1933 book \"Black Bagdad: The Arabian Nights Adventures of a Marine Captain in Haiti\", he described a Haitian prisoner sticking pins into an effigy to induce illness. Its use also appeared in film representations of Haitian Vodou such as Victor Halperin's 1932 \"White Zombie\" and Jacques Tourneur’s 1943 \"I Walked with a Zombie\".\n\nIn the 1975 film, \"Lisztomania\", a voodoo doll is used, resembling Franz Liszt. In the 1984 film, \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\", a voodoo doll is used, resembling Indiana Jones.\n\nBy the early 21st century, the image of the voodoo doll had become particularly pervasive. It had become a novelty item available for purchase, with examples being provided in vending machines in British shopping centres, and an article on \"How to Make a Voodoo Doll\" being included on WikiHow. A voodoo doll had also been included in the 2009 animated Disney movie, \"The Princess and the Frog\".\n\n"}

He attended a Catholic primary school (St Fidelis' Primary) in Moreland, St Ambrose primary school Brunswick, St Joseph's College, and then Coburg Technical School. Qualifying for a teaching certificate, he worked as an art teacher, then attended RMIT to study art and graphic design.\n\nTandberg started working at Leader Community Newspapers in 1963, although he claimed he lost this job for impersonating his boss. At around the same time, he was producing a regular comic strip called \"Fred and Others\" which was syndicated to \"The Herald\" in Melbourne, \"The Advertiser\" in Adelaide, and eventually international papers including \"The Washington Post\" and the \"Los Angeles Times\". After a few newspapers dropped the strip, Tandberg approached \"The Age\" about taking it on. Editor Graham Perkin declined, but offered him a job as a political cartoonist, which he reluctantly accepted in 1972, thus beginning a 45-year career with the newspaper. Tandberg became known for his distinctive \"pocket\" cartoons—minimalist single-panel images to complement and draw attention to a story.\n\nTandberg illustrated an HIV/AIDS prevention poster campaign for the National AIDS Education Council with the tag line \"If it's not on, it's not on\" (referring to a condom), which was widely distributed in Australia in the early 1990s.\n\nTandberg died of oesophageal cancer at St John of God Hospital, in Geelong, Victoria, surrounded by his family, in the afternoon of 8 January 2018, at the age of 74. He was survived by his wife, Glen.\n\n\n"}

The school is a part of the Broward County Public Schools district. Founded in 1899 as a school for whites, the high school is the oldest continuously functioning high school in Broward County, Florida, and the oldest in South Florida.\n\nFort Lauderdale High has an FCAT School grade of \"A\" for the 2011-2012 school year, the highest grade a school can achieve.\n\nIt serves: portions of Fort Lauderdale, Wilton Manors, Lazy Lake, a portion of Oakland Park, and a portion of Lauderdale-by-the-Sea.\n\nOn October 2, 1899, Fort Lauderdale’s first school would open in what was then Dade County. Ivy Cromartie (later to become Ivy Stranahan) welcomed nine students into a wood-framed schoolhouse located on South Andrews Avenue, south of the New River. By 1901, there were 18 students enrolled at Fort Lauderdale with only 997 enrolled in all of Dade County. In 1902 the School Board began offering transportation to students living in Hallandale who needed to attend school; each day, students would climb aboard wagons for the ride.\nBy 1910, Fort Lauderdale’s population had grown enough to require the building of a new school so, the old two-room schoolhouse was moved slightly northward to make room. The “modern” two-story concrete school was constructed for a total cost of $7,000. At the time, Fort Lauderdale was the only high school in the 68-mile stretch between Miami and West Palm Beach. By 1914, enrollment reached 325 with only 47 being high school students; this was the first year with a full nine-month term.\nIn 1915, a 46 to 16 vote led the way for construction of a new Fort Lauderdale High School in the newly designated Broward County. The new school was located three blocks east of Andrews Avenue adjacent to Stranahan Park and was constructed for $55,000. The school was also referred to as Central High School because of the large area it served. The first graduating class in 1915 consisted of five boys. By 1916, it could boast that all nine of its teachers had college degrees. In 1924, Fort Lauderdale established its first Honor Society. 1962 saw the opening of the new Fort Lauderdale High School at its present location on NE Fourth Avenue, with its first graduating class celebrating commencement in June, 1963.\nThe past few years have seen tremendous changes to the FLHS campus, most notably the opening of a new three-story classroom building, a modern library, and a two-story cafeteria.\n\n2007 also saw the renaming of NE 4 Ave between the city divider and NE 13 St as “Flying L Drive” in honor of the school's commitment to education and community service. The project was completed by a group of four students in John Pellegrino's Public Affairs class.\n\nA college preparatory program designed for those interested in careers in Law, Criminal Justice, and Public Affairs.\n\nBecause of its location in the county seat, the program allows students access to governmental agencies that are utilized as “living laboratories” for the ultimate learning experience. Students participate in mock trials in a courtroom housed within the school as well as take field trips to the Broward County Courthouse to witness actual trials.\n\nDue to the high interest of its students in Pre-Law, the FLHS debate team is one of the best in the state and competes nationally while providing valuable opportunities for its students.\n\nAllows for students to take more Advanced Placement courses, putting them ahead when they enter college. They offer a wide variety of AP courses from Art to History to English.\n\nAn international pre-university program developed by Cambridge University, designed with a varied curriculum, which also allows students to earn college credit.\nFort Lauderdale High School was named as one of the top 1000 public schools in the nation in 2005, 2006, and 2007. Dr. Gina Eyerman was also named Assistant Principal of the Year at South Plantation High in 2003 just before coming to FLHS.\n\nFort Lauderdale High School is well known in Broward County for its unique mascot, the \"Flying L\": a large winged blue \"L\" with an arrow through its center. Originally the school mascot was known as \"The Fort Lauderdale L\". However, at the 1917 state track meet, a reporter from the Miami Herald remarked \"Look at that L Fly\" as track star Charlie Rhodes ran to victory, starring in numerous events. The following week, the town of Fort Lauderdale voted on nicknaming all of the school's sports teams \"The Flying L's\".\n\nThe Athletic Program began in 1915 with only two men's sports, Fort Lauderdale High now provides the students with eleven varsity sports for men and ten varsity sports for women. The school also offers four junior varsity sports for men and five junior varsity sports for women to participate in. In 1917, FLHS won their first state championship in track, which is where the unique mascot was derived. Over the years the program has accumulated fifty-nine state championships. In 2001 the girls' basketball team won the 4A State Basketball Championship and later in 2004 the boys' track team won the 3A State Championship and Class 3A Region 4 Championship.\n\nIn 1967, Fort Lauderdale High School met Dillard High School in the season opener for both teams. This, along with another game in Broward County between Ely and McArthur the same night, was the first meeting between white and black teams. Prior to the game, the FLHS team members held their own practices as the coaches refused to hold practice due to an ongoing teacher strike.\n\nAs of 2011, the total student enrollment was 2,003. The ethnic makeup of the school was 54% Black, 30% White, 10% Hispanic, 2% Asian or Pacific Islander, 3% Multiracial, and 1% Native American or Native Alaskan.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2192104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192104", "title": "El Diablo (comics)", "text": "El Diablo (comics)\n\nEl Diablo is a name shared by several fictional characters published by DC Comics: Lazarus Lane, Rafael Sandoval, Chato Santana.\n\nThe Chato Santana version of El Diablo appeared in the 2016 \"Suicide Squad\" film set in the DC Extended Universe.\n\nThe original version (Lazarus Lane) debuted in \"All-Star Western\" #2 (October 1970), and was created by Robert Kanigher and Gray Morrow. The character starred in a four issue mini-series published by DC Comics through their Vertigo imprint as a mature readers title; \"El Diablo\" #1 (March 2001) was written by Brian Azzarello and drawn by Danijel Zezelj.\n\nThe second version (Rafael Sandoval) first appeared in \"El Diablo\" #1 (August 1989), and was created by Gerard Jones and Mike Parobeck.\n\nThe third version (Chato Santana) first appeared in \"El Diablo\" #1 (September 2008) and was created by Jai Nitz, Phil Hester and Ande Parks.\n\nLazarus Lane is the original iteration of El Diablo, operating in the later half of the 19th century in the American Old West. Lane was originally a bank teller who is nearly killed by a gang of thieves and put in a coma after being struck by lightning. After being revived by Native American shaman \"Wise Owl\", Lane becomes the vigilante El Diablo. The name El Diablo means \"the devil\" in Spanish.\n\nAccording to \"Jonah Hex\" vol. 2, #11 (Nov. 2006) and #24 (Dec. 2007), Lazarus Lane is cursed to be the host of a minor demon which acts as a Spirit of Vengeance. Lane's body slumbers in a coma while \"El Diablo\" roams the Earth. His fate is similar to that of the current Crimson Avenger. In \"Swamp Thing\" vol. 2, #85 (April 1989), Wise Owl is shown in a more villainous light, with Lane/El Diablo his unwilling servant. In that story, set in 1872, a number of DC's western heroes (including the aforementioned Hex, Bat Lash, Johnny Thunder, and Madame .44) were employed by Otto Von Hammer and Jason Blood to defeat Wise Owl and recover from him an object of great power, which turned out to be a crystal containing the spirit of Swamp Thing, who had become lost in time. When the group killed Wise Owl, Lane's comatose body woke up, and El Diablo apparently vanished forever.\n\nIn \"The New 52\" (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Lazarus Lane appeared in a backup feature in \"All-Star Western\". In this iteration, he was once again cursed by Wise Owl to become the host of a demon. Rather than being in a coma, Lazarus remains awake. However, El Diablo arises from his body whenever he is unconscious.\n\nRafael Sandoval was the second iteration created in 1989 by writer Gerard Jones and artist Mike Parobeck as a title set in the modern DC Universe. This title lasted 16 months. As created by Jones and Parobeck, Sandoval is a rookie member of the city council of Dos Rios, Texas who creates his version of El Diablo (from a festival costume and an old boxing persona and local legends surrounding the Devil) after being stymied by officials while trying to pursue the case of a serial arsonist. Subsequent efforts involved battles with illicit drug smugglers using maquiladora covers for their activities, a hunt for a serial killer, conflicts with human-smuggling operations, and with Sandoval's own conscience over how best to serve the people of Dos Rios.\n\nRafael Sandoval's character has subsequently made guest appearances in one of the \"Justice League\" titles, in which he is possessed by the spirit of an Aztec god-emperor and takes on an appearance reminiscent of the Lazarus Lane Diablo. He also appears in the \"Villains United Special\" when he is pulled out of retirement by Oracle to serve in her \"de facto\" Justice League, whereupon he is attacked by a member of the Royal Flush Gang during a battle at the Enclave M prison in the Sonora Valley, Mexico. He is wounded in the battle, but saved from death by the warden of the facility.\n\nThe current iteration of El Diablo is Chato Santana, an ex-criminal who after being hospitalized, meets a still living comatose Lazarus Lane. It is written by Jai Nitz, pencilled by Phil Hester, with inks by Ande Parks.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Santana's El Diablo is a member of the Suicide Squad. He is later recruited into Checkmate under the leadership of Uncle Sam, until he realizes that he is being lied to and abandons them in search of the truth.\n\n\nJay Hernandez played Chato Santana / El Diablo in the live-action 2016 film \"Suicide Squad\". Unlike most of his Suicide Squad teammates, he is not a ruthless villain, having used his powers to establish himself as a gang leader before he destroyed his family home and killed his wife and two children in a moment of anger. He mourns his actions. Finally he uses his powers to save the rest of the team from Enchantress' minions thanks to Deadshot. El Diablo helps the Squad resist Enchantress's illusions of what they want most if they surrender. He sacrifices himself to defeat Enchantress's powerful brother, turning into his Aztec fire demon form to overpower and hold the enchantress's brother in the blast radius of a powerful military bomb.\n\n\nThe Chato Santana version appears as a background student in \"DC Superhero Girls\".\n\n"}

Cindy grows up as an intelligent and experienced barefooter, which is later always to be one of her best signature trademarks as a teenager. Soon after Cindy's brother is born, Edward and June begin to fight. Cindy tries to keep her parents together but mostly suffers some abuse as well. When her powers of illusion begin to manifest at age fourteen, Cindy runs away from home, buying a one-way bus ticket to Detroit.\n\nOnce in Detroit, Cindy uses her chameleon and illusion-casting powers to protect herself. As she grows to adulthood, she adopts the identity of \"Gypsy\", patterning her dress after the popular image of the gypsy. The Justice League would soon take up residence in a neighborhood near Gypsy's stomping grounds after Aquaman disbands the original League.\n\nShortly after the League moves into their new headquarters Gypsy begins to test and penetrate the League's security measures. Eventually, she becomes brave enough to follow along with them and to aid in the battle against the Overmaster and his Cadre. After this, Gypsy receives an offer to become a full-time member of the Justice League. Gypsy goes on to participate in the League's struggles against the power-mad Anton Allegro and a reactivated Amazo.\n\nGypsy finds cause to test her powers to their limits when the new JLA is unexpectedly ambushed by the Royal Flush Gang during a wilderness retreat. While her teammates are incapacitated, Gypsy ventures outside her own body, in astral form. In this form, she can spy on the Gang's activities. Also during this mission, she receives a dire premonition about the fates of her teammates Steel and Vibe.\n\nThis League is doomed, though. In his bid to wipe out the new JLA, Professor Ivo sends an android to destroy Gypsy, but she manages to find its conscience and convinces it not to kill her. Though Ivo succeeds in killing Vibe (as she'd foreseen), the android sees Cindy safely returned to her parents' keeping.\n\nGypsy's domestic happiness is short-lived, as some time after she has left the JLA, a vengeful Despero arrives at her home and murders her parents. Gypsy would have been Despero's next victim, if not for the intervention of the Martian Manhunter and the rest of the Justice League. Devastated by the loss of her family, Gypsy is immediately recruited by Booster Gold to become a member of the corporate-sponsored team of heroes known as the Conglomerate.\n\nIn \"Justice League Task Force\" series, over time, she grows very close to the Martian Manhunter, developing a sort of father/daughter relationship. The two of them are the mainstays of the short-lived Justice League Task Force. During her time in the JLTF, she is nearly forced to battle Lady Shiva in one early adventure, and is left for dead on another mission. She later joins the revamped Task Force along with L-Ron (in the body of Despero), The Ray, and Triumph.\n\nGypsy and Ray are both later mind-controlled and used by Triumph as during his strike against the reformed JLA; he expressed disgruntlement that their team had been ignored and forgotten when \"the headliners\" reformed. During the battle, she would see Aquaman, her old teammate in Detroit, and say in confusion \"you went away\".\n\nThere have also been hints of a romantic relationship between Gypsy and the Bronze Tiger. Gypsy and J'onn keep in touch. At one point, after she had been killed, Gypsy is resurrected by the Manhunter, who pleads with his Martian god, Hronmeer, to restore her life. She also aids Wonder Woman during a massive battle against Circe.\n\nIn \"Birds of Prey\", Gypsy joined Oracle's Birds of Prey. She has demonstrated greater flexibility with her powers as well, now able to extend her powers of invisibility to others and things around her. Gypsy also teams up with Vixen to clean up the remnants of an old case. The two heroines rescue Stargirl when after discovering that Amos Fortune was kidnapping members of the JSA.\n\nGypsy is one of the imprisoned heroes forced to fight on the behest of the Apokoliptan gods on Earth in the Dark Side Club. Gypsy is part of Martian Manhunter's funeral. She, along with several other heroes are telepathically compelled by the Martian Manhunter to recall Martian history. Later still, she is again accosted by Despero. The villain then brings her unconscious body to Happy Harbor and fights Vixen's ragtag Justice League.\n\nDuring the \"Blackest Night\" storyline, Gypsy, Vixen and Doctor Light battle Black Lantern versions of several deceased members of the Justice League that were attacking the Hall of Justice.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Gyspy is not a member of the League, and first appears as one of the captive metahumans imprisoned by Amanda Waller in a government holding facility. She is a refugee from an alternate dimension, fleeing from Vibe's brother Rupture, a supervillain enslaved to Mordeth. Rupture reveals that Gypsy's full name in the new continuity is Cynthia Mordeth, as she is Mordeth's daughter.\n\nGypsy's primary power is that of illusion casting, which allows her to blend into her background, effectively becoming invisible. It also allows her to adapt to rapidly changing backgrounds without betraying the illusion. She can camouflage both herself and someone in close proximity to her. In Gypsy's first appearance, only her shadow is shown from the Bunker's monitor, and she appears to teleport at the end of the issue.\n\nGypsy's illusion-casting can also be used to project frightening illusions into the minds of other people. These illusions usually show what the affected person fears most. This ability can affect other living things besides people, and Gypsy can use this ability in combat situations. Gypsy has the ability to project an illusion to appear as another person, but that person needs to be her approximate height and weight for it to appear authentic.\n\nGypsy's powers have evolved to the point that she can now cloak not only herself, but a moving vehicle and its passengers. Gypsy also has limited precognitive abilities and astral projection (able to project her spirit from her body).\n\nAside from her powers, Gypsy is an expert in hand-to-hand combat. She's also an accomplished acrobat, able to leap high, run fast, swim, and execute unexpectedly quick martial arts tactics with relative ease. Gypsy also has a strong aptitude in electronics and computers, and has become skilled in the use of firearms. She has been trained by Bronze Tiger.\n\nGypsy makes an appearance in issue #22 of the comic book tie-in of \"Justice League Unlimited\".\n\nThe earth-16 version of Gypsy appears in The Multiversity 01,02 and The Multiversity: The Just 01.\n\n\nAn evil Parallel Earth version of Gypsy named Gypsy Woman appears in \"\". This version is a member of the Crime Syndicate of America, and can become intangible.\n"}

A mortal artist and sculptor, Tessa is the French lover of the protagonist Immortal, Duncan MacLeod, played by Adrian Paul. Tessa is introduced in the pilot episode \"\", first shown in 1992, and appears in all subsequent episodes until \"\" (1993), the fourth episode of season two, in which she is killed. Vandernoot returned to the program for a number of guest appearances in the season two finale, \"\", broadcast in 1994, and the two-part series conclusion \"To Be\" / \"Not To Be\" (1998).\n\nTessa is MacLeod's mortal companion and bears the consequences of his immortality. These include her aging while he does not, the impossibility of having children together and the dangers of MacLeod's involvement in the Game, an ongoing battle in which all Immortals must behead each other until a single victor remains. Fully aware of this situation, Tessa stays with MacLeod, demonstrating her courage, understanding, generosity and compassion.\n\nThe first series of \"Highlander\" was a multi-national co-production including the French entertainment conglomerate Gaumont, which resulted in a French-speaking actor playing Tessa. Vandernoot had to adapt to the North American, fast-paced method of series production and worked with a dialect coach. Her performance was generally praised by reviewers, who especially praised the strong on-screen relationship that Vandernoot and Paul created between their characters. When Vandernoot decided to leave the show, her character was killed, leading to fierce protests among the show's audience and subsequently prompted the producers to have Vandernoot play an evil lookalike of Tessa in the episode \"Counterfeit\". Despite her return, Tessa's death influenced the rest of the series, making it more pessimistic, and creating a significant precedent; Tessa was the first main character of the series to die.\n\nTessa Noël is a central character, who appeared in every episode of the of \"Highlander: The Series\", and in the first four episodes of the . After the character's death, she later returned for cameo appearances in the episodes \"\" in the second season, and \"To Be\" and \"Not To Be\", the sixth season's final two episodes.\n\nTessa was born on August 28, 1958 in Lille, France. When she was seven years old, she fell in love for the first time with then-nineteen-year-old Alan Rothwood (Anthony Head). Tessa recalls in \"\" that she was \"heartbroken\" when he completed his studies and left the country. She remembered that at her first Christmas party in the ballroom of Alan's house, she \"couldn't believe anything could be so beautiful.\" Tessa mentions in \"\" that she was educated at the Sorbonne in Paris, France.\n\nTessa's first encounter with MacLeod is shown in a flashback sequence in \"\". She had recently left the Sorbonne and was working as an artist and conducting tours of the River Seine in Paris. On April 1, 1980, to escape Immortal Christoph Kuyler (Peter Howitt) who was trying to behead him, MacLeod jumped on a Bateau Mouche on which Tessa was working, and charmed her so that he could stay on board. Another flashback scene in the episode \"\" shows how MacLeod revealed his immortality to Tessa. On April 1, 1983, MacLeod made Tessa shoot him in the chest with a pistol. After he revived, MacLeod revealed himself to be an Immortal who could not age or father children, but did not mention the Game. MacLeod expected Tessa to show disgust or fear, but instead Tessa expressed compassion and sadness for his loneliness. As Tessa remains unaware of the Game, MacLeod occasionally fights other Immortals without her knowledge.\n\nWhen the series begins, Tessa and MacLeod have been in a relationship for twelve years and are the proprietors of an antiques store, \"MacLeod and Noel's Antiques\", in the fictional city of Seacouver, Washington, United States. Immortals Slan Quince (Richard Moll) and Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) break into their store, making Tessa aware of the Game. When she learns of this ultimate battle of good and evil, in which Duncan MacLeod must behead or be beheaded, she sarcastically remarks; \"And you didn't think it was important enough to mention.\" When Quince threatens Tessa to distract MacLeod, she first wants to flee with MacLeod, who prepared for her departure and beheads Quince. Aware that other Immortals will challenge MacLeod, Tessa decides to stay with him. They also allow Richie Ryan (Stan Kirsch), a quick-talking petty thief and street punk, to live with them because he was aware of MacLeod's immortality.\nIn \"\" (1993), Tessa witnesses the brutal murder of former artist Anne Wheeler (Diana Barrington), and reacts angrily when she realizes that the police will do nothing about it, saying: \"I'm not hysterical, I don't see things, and I'm not looking for attention. I just want something to be done.\" She decides to find the murderer on her own. When MacLeod tells Tessa that she is stronger than Anne, and that if something happened to him she would be fine, Tessa retorts, \"You only think so because it suits you.\" The murderer is Chief Police Officer Andrew Ballin (Tom Butler) who is beheaded by MacLeod after Ballin failed to kill Tessa.\n\nIn \"\" (1993), Tessa is chosen as the curator of a traveling exhibition entitled \"An historical retrospective on sculpture and form\", which is based in Paris, France. Meanwhile, Immortal Grayson (James Horan) is seeking Victor Paulus, a protegee of MacLeod's friend Darius (Werner Stocker). Tessa decides to leave to Paris before MacLeod fights Grayson and her parting words are: \"Remember. Paris is our city. I'll be waiting for you\". After MacLeod beheads Grayson, he, Tessa and Richie, live in a barge on the Seine near Notre Dame de Paris.\n\nIn \"\" (1993), MacLeod and Tessa search for information about newborn Immortal Alfred Cahill (Martin Kemp). Becoming Immortal has made Cahill insane; he believes he is an angel sent by God to free the world from sin. Cahill starts with the last prostitute he met, Tessa's old friend, Elaine Trent (Sandra Nelson). Tessa is angry to learn the fate of her intelligent, beautiful friend, but later realizes that she \"[sounds] like her judge and jury.\" MacLeod believes that the only way to stop Cahill is to behead him, despite Tessa's opinion that \"Enlightened societies don't kill their insane. They treat them.\" When Cahill comes to the barge looking for MacLeod and finds Tessa alone, Tessa diverts him by welcoming Cahill as a messenger of God. Later, she tells MacLeod with disgust, \"I had to crawl inside his head... I had to think like him... I had to become like him.\"\n\nThe first episode of the second season, \"\" (1993), shows Tessa, MacLeod and Richie settling back to their antiques store in Seacouver and meeting the Watchers, a secret society that observes Immortals without interfering. In \"The Darkness\" (1993), Tessa meets a fortune teller named Greta (Traci Lords) who urges her to flee the city. This reminds MacLeod of another fortune teller, who, back in 1848, predicted that he would bury many women, but marries none. MacLeod impulsively asks Tessa to marry him, to which she agrees. The next day, Tessa is abducted by Pallin Wolf (Andrew Jackson), a renegade Watcher who wants to behead MacLeod. In the meantime, MacLeod tells Richie that he is getting married because of the thought of losing Tessa. Tessa holds her ground in front of Wolf and tries to escape, but Wolf brings her back to her cell. MacLeod finally finds them and kills Wolf, then sends Tessa home with Richie. On their way to the car, Tessa and Richie are shot dead by Marc Roszca (Travis MacDonald), a drug addict wanting their money. Richie's previously unknown immortality is revealed when he returns to life on the spot, but Tessa dies. MacLeod, devastated, leaves their home and sells the antique store.\n\n\"\" (1993) shows the aftermath of Tessa's death. MacLeod tells Richie, \"She was part of our lives, Richie. Never pretend she wasn't.\" MacLeod also advises Richie to get used to her loss, because it \"won't be the last time it happens to you.\" Later, while MacLeod trains Richie roughly so that he can face Immortal Annie Devlin (Sheena Easton), Richie angrily tells MacLeod, \"You can't get past it, Mac. I know. You've seen a lot of people die. But you had to be the hero, you sent us out to the car that night, you could have been there ...You look me in the eyes and you tell me you don't blame yourself for her death.\" Some time later, MacLeod bitterly tells Devlin, \"Nothing you do brings anyone back. Once they're dead... nothing.\"\n\nIn the two-part finale to series two, \"Counterfeit\" (1994), James Horton (Peter Hudson), a renegade Watcher who believes all Immortals must be eliminated, uses killer Lisa Halle (Meilani Paul) to try and kill MacLeod. Lisa undergoes plastic surgery to resemble Tessa and therefore is played by Vandernoot from that point on. MacLeod meets Lisa just after he admitted to himself how much he missed Tessa, and he is stunned by her resemblance with Tessa. Despite knowing that Tessa is dead and cannot return, he eagerly pursues a relationship with Lisa. He eventually admits the truth when he discovers a scar on Lisa's jaw. Horton kills Lisa on Tessa's grave before being himself killed by MacLeod.\n\n\"To Be\" and \"Not To Be\" (1998), the series finale, respectively depict MacLeod dreaming of a world in which he was never born. Vandernoot reprises her role as Tessa, this time never having met MacLeod. Tessa leads an unsatisfactory life in which she has a husband and children, but is forced to sacrifice her art and sculpture. In this storyline she has an affair with MacLeod but feels she has betrayed her husband.\n\nTessa, and Kirsch's character Richie, were designed as MacLeod's mortal companions and contacts. Tessa and MacLeod are lovers and share deep feelings for each other. Adrian Paul commented that MacLeod spent twelve years with Tessa without wanting another relationship and that \"...she was a very important part of his life\". Vandernoot thought that \"...the relationship between Tessa and MacLeod was very deep because very soon, he told her about himself (...) because he trusted her, and I think trust is a very good definition of their relationship. She trusted him entirely and he trusted her.\" Tessa is thus MacLeod's only mortal lover who knows of his immortality.\n\nHowever, executive producer Bill Panzer was intrigued by the idea that a mortal would want to spend their life with an Immortal, this choice having several drawbacks. MacLeod does not age, while Tessa is mortal and will age. Despite their mutual wish, they know growing old together is impossible and this uneasy thought \"...haunts them both, sometimes more than others.\" As an Immortal, MacLeod is also sterile and Tessa resigns herself to having no children. \"\" deals with Tessa's choice and its impact upon her life. In this episode, Tessa becomes very fond of a four-year-old girl and muses; \"For a while there, just for a few hours... I felt like she was mine. I liked how it felt. But, she's not... I have my own life and it's more than enough.\" Panzer commented that \"The Sea Witch\" \"...brings forth in a very powerful way what exactly [Tessa]'s giving up to be with MacLeod.\"\n\nTessa occasionally meets MacLeod's previous Immortal lovers. In \"\", she immediately dislikes Amanda (played by Elizabeth Gracen) and the script notes that \"...sparks fly between the two women\". Although she quickly earns Amanda's respect, Tessa feels like she has to compete with Amanda, while Amanda comments that Tessa is \"...quite refreshing in a gauche sort of way.\" Gracen played Amanda's interaction with Tessa ambiguously and a little flirtatiously. Tessa is usually jealous of MacLeod's past lovers, but acknowledges in \"\" that \"...it would take me several lifetimes to find out everything in Duncan's past. I know there've been others, but I never thought I would meet one of them.\"\n\nIn addition, Tessa shares with MacLeod the consequences of his involvement in the Game. She dislikes the Game and would like to escape from it with him, since she fears for his life. According to Vandernoot, Tessa \"...always thought that she [would] die before [MacLeod]\", but when he told her about the Game during \"The Gathering\", \"she [realised] that he [could] be killed\", thus she avoided thinking about it. Another consequence of the Game is that Tessa is sometimes exposed to danger from Immortals who want to use her to pressure MacLeod. Despite being captured by Quince in \"The Gathering\", by the time of \"Band of Brothers\", she is able to face Grayson: \"If you think [MacLeod] will stand by, ...you have misjudged him terribly. So you'd better kill me, now, and be done with it.\" Grayson releases her and calls her \"...a remarkable woman, well worth keeping alive.\" Consequently, Tessa is fully aware of the risks of their relationship, but stays with MacLeod, explaining in \"Eyewitness\" that \"I know the risks I choose to take... I stay with you because I want to. I won't run. I'm not the little woman and I'll never be barefoot and pregnant. We all have things to face. This is mine.\" However, she finds it difficult to deal with her fears when MacLeod leaves to fight another Immortal.\n\nVandernoot found Tessa's personality \"...very nice,\" \"very understanding, generous, supportive.\" MacLeod appreciates that Tessa always has a way of reminding him of his humanity. In \"For Evil's Sake\", she tells a guilt-ridden MacLeod that \"You may be Immortal, but you're not omnipotent... The world is not your responsibility.\" Tessa often jokes about MacLeod's immortality, for example telling him in \"\" that the last time MacLeod \"...wore a tuxedo was on the deck of the \"Titanic\".\"\nTessa is able to empathise with others, feel as they do, think as they do and so become like them. When MacLeod revealed his immortality to Tessa in \"Counterfeit Part Two\", she can show compassion instead of the fear or disgust he expects: \"I was just thinking how lonely you must be. Your parents, your friends... having them all die.\" Tessa is a very empathic and understanding character, for example, in \"Saving Grace\", she is jealous of MacLeod's former lover Grace; however, when MacLeod assures her that he no longer loves Grace, her response is simply that \"...that's all that need to be said. She's your friend and she's been hurt. You'll help her. I'd expect you to do no less.\"\n\nFurthermore, Tessa demonstrates great courage, for example in \"\", where she is abducted by three mountain men led by Immortal Caleb Cole, who wants to marry her. Tessa refuses to submit and spreads doubt among them, resulting in Cole finally killing one of his own men before MacLeod rescues her. Reviewer Rob Lineberger of DVDVerdict.com commented that \"...this episode shows the tough stuff Tessa is made of.\" Tessa is a very selfless character, although it has, occasionally, been known to put her into rather sticky situations, for example, in the episode \"See No Evil\", Tessa's friend, Natalie, is attacked by serial killer Michael Tanovsky and Tessa uses herself as bait: \"Nobody's watching over his next victim, Duncan... and she's going to die if you and I don't stop him.\" Lineberger commented that \"[in \"See No Evil\"], Tessa gets a taste for how Duncan's life must feel when she faces the killer.\" She hits Tanovsky with her car, telling MacLeod \"I thought ridding the world of evil would feel better than this.\" Panzer comments that having Tessa stop the killer \"...was kind of an unusual idea [in television in 1992], and this was the subject of a lot of meetings with [then-supervising producer] David Abramowitz, myself and the people from the various networks, domestic and foreign, who were involved.\" Tessa has a reputation for speaking frankly and for refusing to tolerate any nonsense. In \"\", when MacLeod refuses to take her where an evil Immortal is, she says, \"I know why you don't want me there. You're afraid that what happened to Lucas [MacLeod's friend who has just been beheaded] could happen to you.\" Tessa has no self-pity and \"...doesn't like euphemisms\". For example, in \"For Tomorrow We Die\", MacLeod calls her \"contrary by nature\" Tessa parks her car without regard to interdictions, can drive a speedboat, is a poor chess player and dislikes war.\n\nTessa is a prominent professional artist. She organises exhibitions of her works and sells a metallic sculpture to the City of Seacouver to adorn a park. Tessa is often seen making art works and welding large pieces of metal together, drawing or using modelling clay. She is also seen sketching people with whom she has problems. Tessa believes that \"...an artist should never grow complacent. Change is good,\" and fears the Paris art critics because \"...they are the worst\".\n\nIn the script of \"The Gathering\", Tessa is described as \"...a beautiful, elegantly casual woman, artist, free spirit, and proprietor of the most unusual antique shop in the city.\" The script of the episode \"Saving Grace\" says that she has grace and style. Tessa is portrayed as a tall, thin woman with blonde hair and blue eyes. Because \"Highlander: The Series\" was an international co-production, the producers cast a French-speaking actor to play Tessa. Producer Gary Goodman explained that they wanted someone \"...that would be appealing on a television screen... in the sense that you were comfortable with her accent and her character\". They chose Belgian actress Alexandra Vandernoot because she \"...was able to be exotic, pretty and not so unfamiliar to an American audience that she was accepted.\"\n\nVandernoot recalled, \"I think I was quite close to Tessa, she was very well written, very easy to play and I wish I was like that. I'm not sure I'd like that but... it's very nice, you know, to play a character with nice feelings and nice emotions.\" Vandernoot had to adapt to the North American way of filming series and learn to work fast. She said that filming the series was \"...exhausting but formative\", and that filming in English was \"challenging\". Vandernoot, who is a native French speaker, had a dialect coach.\n\nVandernoot and Paul created a strong on-screen relationship between their characters. David Abramowitz, creative consultant from the second season onwards, said, \"When I saw her and Adrian together, I thought that if I died, and there was a Mount Olympus, that the two of them would be standing together with thunderbolts around them. They were god-like. They were so beautiful and had such presence.\" Paul said that he was \"detached\" from the fictional relationship between Tessa and MacLeod, but that \"...it was a good relationship\". Later, he said he \"...was sad to see it go.\"\n\nProducer Barry Rosen said, \"We were very lucky that [Vandernoot and Kirsch] were so human-grounded, so we could really play off of them and the way they looked at things that [Paul] went through. They were also able to get into real-life situations, romances, getting in trouble, jealousies and so on.\" Although Vandernoot and Kirsch are three years apart in age (Vandernoot being the older of the two), on set Vandernoot treated Kirsch like a young boy, while Kirsch seemed to her like a younger brother because of his youthful appearance.\n\nIn 1993, Vandernoot wanted to leave the show because shooting \"Highlander\" was too demanding and required her to spend several months each year in Canada. Vandernoot also wanted to spend more time with her family. According to Abramowitz, a further, artistic, reason was that \"...a small part of [Vandernoot] being a really strong actress wanted to play a more aggressive part in the show and sadly, the nature of the beast was that it couldn't happen and she made a decision.\" Panzer said that creating interesting female characters in the \"Highlander\" franchise was often a challenge because the producers found it difficult to \"...have the women be something other than a victim, a hostage, other things when [one is] dealing with an immortal hero.\" Consequently, the creative staff needed to write Tessa out of the show but were restricted because of the character's strong relationship with MacLeod. Associate Creative Consultant Gillian Horvath said that, \"There was no way... to have a scene where she said, 'Okay, I'm going to go to Paris without you. Nice knowing you, MacLeod.'\" The writers decided that the only solution was for Tessa to die, despite Abramowitz's feeling that her death was \"...sad\" and \"...heartbreaking\".\n\nTessa's death occurs in the fourth episode of the second season; \"The Darkness\". The creative staff decided Tessa would die in a random carjacking incident. Tessa's death played no role in the episode's main storyline. It was not formulaic; the writers wanted to shock the audience. Abramowitz said that \"...it would have been easier to kill her off in the episode,\" but the writers \"...wanted it to be a surprise and show how shocking [Tessa's death] was to [them].\" Horvath said that \"...losing a loved one to a random act of violence is something that happens totally unexpectedly, at a moment that makes no sense dramatically\". Tessa's death scene shows MacLeod kneeling next to Tessa and holding her corpse, then Richie reviving as an Immortal and speaking with MacLeod.\n\nDuring the filming of the episode, however, no dialog was recorded. The final version of the episode shown in North America did not show Richie revive. The European version showed Richie reviving, but no dialog was present. This scene was later re-recorded in Paris in 1994 during the filming of the season finale \"Counterfeit Part Two\", this time including the dialog. However, this footage was not seen in the final version; the footage was eventually used in the season four episode \"Leader of the Pack\".\n\n\"The Darkness\" had the desired effect; Lineberger wrote that \"I was taken aback by the dark tone and emotional range generated by this episode. \"Highlander\" is a fantasy series, yet I cared about the characters as though I know them... Vandernoot gave Tessa such vitality and charm that her death left me reeling.\" Abramowitz said that Tessa's death strongly angered many viewers, and that \"...people hated me for killing her.\"\n\nThe audience became angrier still when in the following episode, \"Eye For An Eye\", MacLeod made love to Immortal Annie Devlin. Abramowitz explained the creative decision of his staff by saying that \"...someone once told me that death was an aphrodisiac. It's a thing that pushes you to life and the greatest thing in life, that's 'seize life', is sex.\" Lineberger wrote in his review of \"Eye For An Eye\", \"This one caused an uproar— one I feel is justified. [Abramowitz] gave a defense (in my opinion a weak one) (...) I have a high tolerance for insensitive guy stuff, but this got to me. When Duncan rolled into Annie's arms, part of me smirked in appreciation of Duncan's magnetic charm. But the rest of me found his actions cruel to the viewers.\" Abramowitz confirmed that \"...the fans hated it. And the women wanted to string me up. I was a 'cad' and a 'card'...\" Paul also reported an angry reaction from the audience after the seventh episode, \"The Return of Amanda\", in which MacLeod sleeps with Amanda.\n\nTessa's death was a turning point in \"Highlander: The Series\". It marked the first time that a regular character died in the show; it would be followed by the deaths of Charlie DeSalvo and Richie Ryan. Horvath recalled that \"...it changed the tone of the show. It made \"Highlander\" the show where you couldn't be positive that the characters were safe because they were in the credits.\" Tessa's death also gave the show a pessimistic tone that influenced the remaining characters. Rosen explained that \"...in the years that followed without her and with [Kirsch's character] becoming Immortal, (...) you had to play the show differently.\" Lineberger said that \"Richie and Duncan relate to each other differently from now on, and Duncan is bereft of much of his joy [and] moodier as well. Tessa is no longer around to lighten him.\"\n\nTessa remained extremely popular with the audience after her death, prompting the producers to develop the season two finale episode \"Counterfeit\" to bring her back. According to Kirsch, Vandernoot did not realize her, or her character's, popularity before attending conventions. Paul said that Vandernoot was surprised that her character had so much influence on the show and that her return was \"...fun for her to do, especially to play a different character which was similar to Tessa but also had an evil intent to her.\"\n\nThe \"Counterfeit\" story features the character Lisa undergoing plastic surgery to become Tessa's double. Lisa was played by Meilani Paul before the surgery and by Vandernoot after it. The producers wondered whether the story needed to explain the change in Lisa's voice, as she would be played by a different actor. They considered suggesting that her voice changed because of the surgery, then decided that Lisa would have voice training. After her operation, Lisa speaks with Vandernoot's voice when posing as Tessa, and with Meilani Paul's voice when the character was not acting. This was achieved using automated dialogue replacement during post-production.\n\nAdrian Paul said that Vandernoot portrayed Lisa as a smoker to mark her out as a different character from Tessa. Paul also said that his lovemaking scene with Vandernoot had to reflect the different relationship between MacLeod and Lisa from that between MacLeod and Tessa. According to Paul, Lisa was more like a temptress to MacLeod than was Tessa. According to Panzer, the original script featured Horton sending Lisa to kill MacLeod on the latter's barge. After reading the draft script, Adrian Paul thought the idea of Lisa trying to kill MacLeod on Tessa's grave would have a more dramatic effect.\n\nBill Panzer said that Tessa became popular with the program's audience. Rob Lineberger called Tessa \"...beautiful and spirited,\" and said that \"...she is the perfect mortal foil for MacLeod's heavy concerns. She lightens and strengthens him.\" Reviewer Abbie Bernstein of the Audio Video Revolution website wrote that Tessa was \"...depicted not as a screechy, in-the-dark Lois Lane but rather as a woman who handles her lover’s supernatural aspects with remarkable pragmatism.\" Berstein added that Tessa was \"estimable\" and \"...an unusually gutsy love interest (not to mention a refreshing sexually active heroine, as opposed to the coy 'sexual tension'-generating females who usually populate the genre).\" Other reviewers had a more negative opinion. Reviewer Gord Lacey of TVShowsOnDVD.com \"...found it odd that everyone liked Tessa because [he] found her rather annoying.\" Reviewer Doug Anderson of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" wrote that Tessa was \"...too arty and sympathetic to serve any purpose other than an emotional spur for the hero's vengeance.\"\n\nReviewer David M. Gutierrez, also of DVDVerdict.com, noted the \"...strong on-screen chemistry between Tessa and MacLeod.\" So did Lineberger: \"One gets the feeling they have been together for years, though the series is fresh out of the box,\" and he added, \"Together, they are a model couple. They have healthy banter, intense arguments, plenty of romance, and an easy comfort with each other.\" Bernstein wrote; \"Paul and Vandernoot are charming separately and together\". Joanne Ostrow of \"The Denver Post\" wrote that \"Paul and Vandernoot don't look like typical American TV-style bimbos and hunks, and for good reason. They were cast to appeal internationally.\"\n\nDiscussing Vandernoot's performance, Lineberger called her a \"...gifted actor\", saying that \"...she has the poise, restraint, and grace to be both sensual and frustrated, accomplished yet vulnerable, mortal but aware of greater concerns.\" John Goff of \"Variety\" noted that Vandernoot was \"attractive\" and Anderson called her a \"...Michelle Pfeiffer look-alike.\"\n\nReviewing the episode \"Counterfeit\", Gutierrez wrote that \"...despite the fact that the having an exact twin of Tessa's pop up is flatly ludicrous, it plays out due to MacLeod's desire to have Tessa back overriding his sense of reason. (...) Vandernoot likes the Tessa character quite a bit and gave me the impression she was sad to see her go,\" and that she \"...looks like she enjoys playing the good/bad Lisa. Her triple performance as Tessa shows Vandernoot's range.\" Kathie Huddleston of Scifi.com felt that \"...a visit from Tessa in \"Counterfeit\", even an evil Tessa look-alike, is a welcome nod to a significant character from the first season, and it gave our boy Duncan a moment or two to reflect on his recent lost love.\"\n\n"}

This house was carefully reconstructed in 1943 and moved to the grounds of the Witte Museum, where it is still used for educational purposes.\n\nIn 1805 Ruiz became a city councilman, or regidor, in San Antonio. He served in various official capacities including city attorney, or procurador.\n\nRuiz began a long military career in 1811, joining the Bexar Provincial Militia with the rank of lieutenant. He joined the Republican Army at Bexar and took part in failed revolution from Spain in 1813, fighting at the battle of Medina on August 18. Forced into exile from Texas until 1822, Ruiz returned after Mexico won its independence from Spain. He was ordered by the Mexican government to make attempts at peace with the hostile Native American tribes of the North, the Comanches and the Lipan Apaches. Appointed to the mounted militia upon his return, he successfully led a peace treaty delegation of Lipan Apache to Mexico City later in 1822. The next year, Ruiz received a promotion to army captain, unassigned, with the rank of lieutenant colonel, receiving confirmation of his commission in 1825. He was sent to Nacogdoches in December 1826 to help put down the Fredonian Rebellion, receiving command of that detachment in April of the next year.\n\nRuiz was a member of the Comisión de Límites (Boundary Commission), which was assigned to explore areas of Texas following the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819. This commission left Mexico City on November 10, 1827, under the command of General Manuel de Mier y Terán. Ruiz returned to Bexar in 1828, where he commanded the famed Second Flying Company of San Carlos de Parras, which established Fort Tenoxtitlán in 1830.\n\nIn the fall of 1828, Ruiz led the Mier y Teran group of 30 Mexican soldiers and commission members, including naturalist Jean-Louis Berlandier, on a bear and buffalo hunt on open lands northwest of San Antonio, with the cooperation of local Comanche leaders Reyuna and El Ronca. From November 19 to December 18, Ruiz and a military party explored the silver mines on the San Saba River. During this time, he wrote his \"Report on the Indian Tribes of Texas in 1828\", preserved in the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University. An insight into the trust Ruiz garnered with the Indian tribes of Texas can be found in the Shawnee tribe's reference to him as \"a good man no lie and a friend of the Indians.\"\n\nRuiz retired from the military at the end of 1832.\n\nRuiz allied himself with the Texas Revolution in 1835 and traveled to Washington-on-the-Brazos in late February 1836, as a delegate to the Convention of 1836. There on March 2, 1836, Ruiz, along with his nephew José Antonio Navarro, signed the Texas Declaration of Independence - the only native Texans among the fifty-nine men to sign this historic document.\n\nDuring the revolution he was an outspoken supporter of independence, and he eloquently wrote to his family, \"Under no circumstance take sides against the Texans, for only God will return the territory of Texas to the Mexican government.\"\n\nRuiz's son Francisco Antonio Ruiz, San Antonio mayor or alcalde, at the time, was an important eyewitness to the Battle of the Alamo, having been placed under house arrest at his San Antonio home by Antonio López de Santa Anna and later forced by the Mexican dictator to identify the bodies of the deceased after the battle.\n\nJosé Francisco Ruiz represented the Bexar district as its Senator in the 1st Congress of the Republic of Texas.

The Chehalis is a fishing stream and, together with its tributaries such as Statlu Creek, offers opportunities for class III and IV whitewater kayaking.\n\nThe Chehalis River starts in the mountains above and just west of Statlu Lake, which it soon flows into. Shortly after exiting the lake, it drops over impressive Statlu Falls, which is difficult to view without putting yourself in real danger. People have died when they have slipped and fallen over the falls. After the falls, the river turns south, eventually flowing into Chehalis Lake. After it exits the lake it continues its journey south to the Harrison River.\n\nThe river's canyon and the peaks and cliff-faces of the range encircling its basin, which comprises most of the area of the Douglas Ranges, is popular with rock-climbers and hikers, who call the area \"the Chehalis\".

It is lined with many cafés, one of the most famous being Les Deux Garçons and during its history frequented by famous French cultural figures such as Paul Cézanne, Émile Zola and Albert Camus.\n\nThe street has wide sidewalks planted with double rows of plane-trees. The Cours Mirabeau is decorated by fountains, the most notable of which is the Fontaine de la Rotonde , a large fountain that makes up a roundabout at one end of the street. The street also divides Aix into two portions, the Quartier Mazarin, or \"new town\", which extends to the south and west, and the Ville comtale, or \"old town\", which lies to the north with its wide but irregular streets and its old mansions dating from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nFrom 1646 onwards, rich locals started moving into the Mazarin quarter, built by Michele Mazzarino (1605 - 1648), known as \"Michel Mazarin\", the Dominican who was appointed Archbishop of Aix-en-Provence in 1645 by Pope Innocent X. Mazzarino had been professor of theology at the College of Saint Thomas, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\" in Rome, and Master of the Sacred Palace under Pope Urban VIII in 1642. Mazzarino was also the brother of Giulio Mazzarino, known as \"Jules Mazarin\" who served as chief minister under Louis XIV of France.\n\nIn 1650, the Parliament of Aix-en-Provence commissioned the building of a thoroughfare for carts where there was a crumbled rampart. The idea was for it to become the new place of dalliance for Aix dwellers, instead of the place des Prêcheurs.\n\nThe thoroughfare cost 100,000 pounds, and was paid for by property buyers, the town (15,000 pounds), Provence communes (20,000 livres) and Louis, Duke of Vendôme.\n\nA long enclosure closed off by ramparts, town houses were gradually built on each side. A balustrade would look to fields and gardens downwards.\n\nBy 1696 four fountains had been built : \"Fontaine des 9 canons\", \"Fontaine \"Moussue\", \"Fontaine du Roi René\" and, to the west, \"les Chevaux-Marins\", now vanished.\n\nWhilst he first thought of building a palace there, the Duke of Vendôme came around and decided on the 'wildness of fields'. Instead he commissioned the Pavillon Vendôme, where he died in 1669. His son, Louis Joseph de Vendôme (1654–1712), sold their part of the Cours Mirabeau back to Pierre de Creissel, who sold it again to four buyers, thus dividing it into four town houses.\n\nIn 1876, Patrice de Mac-Mahon (1808-1893) signed a decree for it to be named after Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau.\n\n"}

The expurgated diary reveals Nin the philosopher and amateur but astute psychologist. The unexpurgated diary reveals a woman breaking out into wild sexual discovery. It is introduced by her second—bigamous—husband.\nA film based on the book was released in 1990.\n\nAt the end of 1931, Nin finds herself dissatisfied with being a timid, faithful wife to her banker husband, Hugh Parker Guiler. Nin and her husband contemplate the possibility of opening their relationship, and determine that it would threaten their marriage. However, when Anais meets June Miller, she is magnetically drawn to her and perceives June to be the most beautiful and charismatic woman she has ever met. Nin pursues an extremely intense, ambiguous, sexually charged friendship with her. When June leaves, Nin becomes involved with Henry, and begins an uninhibited sexual and emotional affair with him, which prompts an intellectual and sensual awakening. A friendship is formed between the two that was maintained throughout both artist's lives.\n\nThe book was later filmed as \"Henry & June\" directed by Philip Kaufman, with Fred Ward as Henry, Uma Thurman as June, and Maria de Medeiros as Anaïs Nin. The movie, released in 1990, is notable as the first film to be released in the United States with an NC-17 rating.\n\nThe same year the book was also adapted into a film as \"The Room of Words (),\" a low-budget Italian production directed by Franco Molé.\n"}
{"id": "2192146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192146", "title": "Dai pai dong", "text": "Dai pai dong\n\nDai pai dong () is a type of open-air food stall in Hong Kong. The official government name for these establishments is \"cooked-food stalls\". The more common name, \"dai pai dong\", literally means \"big licence stall\" in Cantonese, referring the stalls' license plates, which are larger than those of other licensed street vendors. \n\nFounded after the Second World War, \"dai pai dong\" are tucked next to buildings, on streets and in alleys. For instance, \"the dai pai dong\" in Central and Western districts are regard as \"terrace type\" \"dai pai dong\"since most of the streets are sloped, meaning the stalls occupy different terraces. In the late 20th century, the Hong Kong government decided to restrict the operation and license of \"dai pai dong\" in order to remove them from public streets. Some were relocated into indoor cooked food markets built by the government. After the decline of \"dai pai dong\" from the 1970s, most of them no longer operate within the family but through sole proprietorship or partnership instead.\n\nAccording to the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, there are only 25 \"dai pai dong\" remaining in Hong Kong. As a valuable touchstone of Hong Kong heritage and culture, the word \"dai pai dong\" was recognized by the Oxford English Dictionary in March 2016.\n\nA dai pai dong is characterized by its green-painted steel kitchen, untidy atmosphere, the lack of air conditioning, as well as a variety of low priced great-wok hei dishes. Regarded by some as part of the collective memory of Hong Kong people, official \"dai pai dong\" are scarce today, numbering only 28, situated in Central (10), Sham Shui Po (14), Wan Chai (1), Tai Hang (2), and Tai O (1). \n\nAlthough the term \"dai pai dong\" is often used generically to refer to any food stall operating on the roadside with foldable tables, chairs and no air-conditioning (like those on Temple Street), legally speaking the term can only refer to those 28 stalls which possess the \"big licences\".\n\nUnlicensed food stalls, which provide cheap everyday food such as congee, rice and noodles to the general public of humble income, appeared as early as the late 19th century in Hong Kong. The stalls could be found not only in Central, but also in Wan Chai and the peripheries of Happy Valley Racecourse around Wong Nai Chung Road. In fact, the fire at the racecourse in 1918 was caused by food stalls set beside the podium. There were also stalls assembled by wharf piers, which formed the so-called \"Waisik Matau\" (為食碼頭 lit. \"Gluttonous Pier\"), to serve ferry passengers. \n\nAfter World War II came to an end in 1945, the colonial Hong Kong government issued \"ad hoc\" licenses to families of deceased and injured civil servants, allowing them to operate food stalls in public and thereby earn a living. This type of license was physically considerably larger than the ones normally issued, as a photograph of the licensee was required to appear on them. The licence, therefore, was jocularly called \"\"dai pai\"\" (big license) by the locals. From then on, the \"big license stalls\" began to flourish on every busy street and lane in Hong Kong. \n\nHowever, \"dai pai dong\" soon became the cause of traffic congestion and hygiene problems, and some licensees even began to let out their stalls on the black market. In response, the government stopped issuing new \"big licenses\" in 1956, and limited their transfer. The licences could no longer be inherited, and could only be passed on to spouses upon the licensee's death. If the licensee did not have a spouse, the licence would simply expire. \n\nSince 1975, many \"dai pai dong\" have been moved into temporary markets, like the ones on Haiphong Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, or into cooked food centres, usually located in municipal services complexes managed by the Urban Council, for easier control. To improve worsening public hygiene, the government began to buy back \"big licenses\" from the license-holders in 1983. Since most of the licensees were aged, and the licenses are only legally transferable to their spouses, many of the licensees were willing to return their licenses for compensation. Since then, the number of traditional \"dai pai dong\" has declined rapidly.\n\nToday, most \"dai pai dong\" survive by operating in cooked food centers, while the more successful ones have reinvented themselves as air-conditioned restaurants (some of them keep their original stalls operating at the same time, like Lan Fong Yuen (蘭芳園) in Gage Street, Central).\n\nIt was reported that revenues of \"dai pai dong\" increased considerably in 2003 when Hong Kong was plagued by SARS; as people regarded air-conditioned places as hotbeds of the virus and patronised open-air and sun-lit stalls instead.\n\n\nIn May 2005, the existence of \"dai pai dong\" in Hong Kong caught considerable public attention, as Man Yuen Noodles, a \"dai pai dong\" selling noodles in Central, faced imminent closure due to the death of the licensee. The news came after the closure of a bakery notable for its egg tarts, also located in Central and forced to close because of the rise of rent. The bakery reopened in October 2005.\n\nDespite calls for its preservation by many locals, including some politicians, the stall was closed on 30 July 2005. The Hong Kong government was criticised for not trying its best to preserve \"dai pai dong\" as part of the Hong Kong culture. The news of the closure coincided with the government's proposal of the development of West Kowloon Cultural District. The stall has unexpectedly reopened at a nearby shop on 1 December 2005.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2192151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192151", "title": "Sigi Schmid", "text": "Sigi Schmid\n\nSiegfried \"Sigi\" Schmid (; March 20, 1953 – December 25, 2018) was a German-American soccer coach who had the most wins in the history of Major League Soccer (MLS). Born in Tübingen, West Germany, he moved to the United States with his family when he was a child. He played college soccer from 1972 to 1975 at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he was a starting midfielder in each of his four years. He coached his former college team, the UCLA Bruins, between 1980 and 1999. During that period, he became one of the most successful collegiate coaches of all time, leading the Bruins to a record of 322–63–33 (wins–losses–draws). The team made 16 consecutive playoff appearances from 1983 to 1998, winning the national championship in 1985, 1990, and 1997. Schmid also worked with U.S. Soccer throughout the 1990s.\n\nSchmid coached the Los Angeles Galaxy and the Columbus Crew in MLS, before becoming the head coach of Seattle Sounders in 2009. Despite never having played soccer at a professional level, he has the most coaching wins in MLS history and was the recipient of the MLS Coach of the Year Award in 1999 and 2008. Throughout his career, Schmid received praise from critics for his ability to identify new talent. His defensive tactics were also highly regarded in the press and often cited as a factor in his success. However, their deployment in his final two seasons with Los Angeles led directly to the termination of his contract.\n\nAfter winning the MLS Cup with Columbus in 2008, Schmid was hired by the expansion Seattle Sounders as their first head coach. From 2009 to 2016, Schmid led the Sounders to seven playoff appearances, four Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup titles, and an MLS Supporters' Shield in 2014. After lackluster performances in the playoffs and missteps during the first half of the 2016 season, Schmid left the club on mutual terms and was replaced by Brian Schmetzer as interim head coach. Schmid joined ESPN as a studio analyst and was named the head coach of Los Angeles once again in 2017, replacing Curt Onalfo. He resigned from the position in September 2018 and was replaced by assistant coach Dominic Kinnear.\n\nWith Bachelor of Economics and Master of Business Administration degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Schmid was a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) before coaching full-time. Schmid and his wife had four children. Schmid died on December 25, 2018, weeks after being hospitalized in Los Angeles with a heart-related condition.\n\nSigi Schmid was born in Tübingen, West Germany, on March 20, 1953. At the age of four, he moved with his family to the United States; they took up residence in Torrance, California, in 1962. Schmid's father, Fritz, who had been a prisoner of war during World War II, worked at Pabst Brewing; his mother, Doris, ran a Los Angeles-based German deli, where Schmid worked on weekends. Schmid's family spoke German at home, making him feel German despite spending so much of his life in America. He began school in the United States with little understanding of English and a stuttering speech disorder he did not overcome until high school. In his youth, Schmid visited Germany every summer, playing soccer with the local children and watching Bundesliga clubs play exhibition matches in neighboring towns. In 1964, Schmid played for one of the inaugural American Youth Soccer Organization teams, and was inducted into the AYSO Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\nDespite Schmid's early soccer experience, his parents thought a career in the sport was unfeasible and encouraged him to pursue business. He enrolled at UCLA in 1972 and was a starting midfielder for the UCLA Bruins from 1972 to 1975. In his first two seasons, the Bruins were national runners-up in the championships, and advanced to the national semifinals in 1974. In his senior year, Schmid was selected to the 1975 All Far-West team. Schmid completed his playing career at UCLA ranked 11th in all-time assists at the school.\n\nHe received his Bachelor of Economics degree in 1976 before earning a Master of Business Administration from the University of Southern California. Between 1978 and 1984, he worked eight months of the year as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).\n\nSchmid's first coaching experience was in 1975 for Bishop Montgomery High School. He also founded and coached a small club called the South Bay Vikings. Between 1977 and 1979, he served as an assistant coach under Steve Gay at UCLA. Schmid took over as head coach after Gay left the position in 1980. He began focusing solely on coaching before the 1984 season and was named \"Coach of the Year\" by the magazine \"Soccer America\". UCLA then won the 1985 NCAA Division I championship by defeating American University 1–0 after eight periods of overtime. In his first 10 years as coach, the Bruins won or tied 85 percent of their games.\n\nThe Bruins won the 1990 national championship by defeating Rutgers 4–3 on penalty kicks after a scoreless regulation, two sessions of overtime, and another two periods of sudden death. During the 22-game season, UCLA outscored their opponents 61–16. The team continued to thrive in the following season, part of their success coming from Schmid's decision to move Cobi Jones from a midfield position to forward. Jones later played for Schmid in the MLS and became a top player for the national team. Schmid was named the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Coach of the Year for three years straight (1995–97), and NCAA Coach of the Year in 1997 after UCLA defeated the University of Virginia to win a third NCAA championship. A reporter for the \"Richmond Times-Dispatch\" wrote that after winning just two titles in 17 postseason appearances, UCLA had finally shed \"its 'underachiever' label\". The writer also applauded Schmid's decision to move the team's leading striker into a midfield position which led to the player scoring the winning goal.\n\nSchmid spent 19 seasons as the head coach at UCLA, accumulating a record of 322–63–33 (wins–losses–draws), and reaching 16 consecutive playoffs between 1983 and 1998. He earned a reputation for producing some of the nation's best goalkeepers when David Vanole, Brad Friedel, and Matt Reis came through the university. By 1994, he had coached 16 players at UCLA who were later selected for the U.S. national team. Schmid avoided recruiting foreign talent to bolster his squad. He relied mainly on players from California, whom he believed to be less physically aggressive but more creative and attacking.\nWhile coaching at UCLA, Schmid began to work with the U.S. national team. He was the assistant coach at the 1991 World University Games and traveled with the team to Germany in the fall of 1992. In January 1993, he was selected as an assistant to Bora Milutinović for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, during which five of Schmid's UCLA players appeared for the national team. He continued as an assistant during the 1995 Pan American Games. After being appointed U.S. Under-20 national team coach in January 1998, Schmid built his squad around defensive tactics. The team achieved second place in their group during the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship, defeating England and Cameroon, but were eliminated by the eventual champions Spain in the opening knockout round. Schmid returned to coach the U-20 national team at the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship. The U.S. won the group in the opening stage of the tournament without conceding a goal, but lost to Italy in the first round of the knockout stage. One of the forwards on the national team, Eric Wynalda, said that Schmid's organization on the field was disciplined. Wynalda commented that Schmid had a \"great handle on the defensive side of the game\" while he also admired that the strikers were allowed to be creative. Schmid was inducted into the UCLA Hall of Fame in 2004 after working with UCLA, the national team, and the Los Angeles Galaxy.\n\nSchmid left UCLA to replace Octavio Zambrano as head coach of the Los Angeles Galaxy five games into the 1999 MLS season. At the time, the team was ranked fifth in the Western Conference with a tally of only three goals. Under Schmid in the remainder of the season, the team had a record of 17–9, finished with the second-best record in the league and won their conference, earning him the MLS Coach of the Year Award. The team's captain, Robin Fraser, gave credit to Schmid's emphasis on defense after being named the MLS defender of the year. Los Angeles lost 2–0 to D.C. United in that year's MLS Cup. Schmid made critical comments of the referees after the match; he received a $1,000 fine and suspension for the first game of the following season.\n\nIn 2000, Schmid guided Los Angeles to the playoffs but lost in the semifinals to the Kansas City Wizards. The team also played in that year's CONCACAF Champions' Cup, a competition consisting of the best clubs from North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. The Galaxy defeated the Honduran champion Olimpia 3–2 to win the Cup. Schmid was forced to play an atypical squad since the final was held during the MLS off-season while adjustments to the following season's lineup were being made.\n\nHis successful team of 2001 enjoyed attacking play. The squad included experienced players such as Cobi Jones, Sasha Victorine, Luis Hernández, Simon Elliott, and Mauricio Cienfuegos. The Galaxy won the conference by two points and finished fourth overall with a 14–7–5 record. The team went on to lose to the San Jose Earthquakes in the MLS Cup, but won the U.S. Open Cup a week later with a 2–1 overtime victory against the New England Revolution.\nSuccess followed in 2002 when the Galaxy won the Supporters' Shield for having the best regular season record in the league. Schmid was lauded for his defensive tactics after adjusting the team's standard formation to a 3–5–2 early in the season. The shift allowed Alexi Lalas to play as a sweeper without specific marking responsibilities in the three-man defensive line. Schmid also brought Guatemalan forward Carlos Ruiz to the team; Ruiz won league Most Valuable Player (MVP) award that year. Amidst criticism for failing to win in previous years, the franchise won its first MLS Cup with a 1–0 overtime victory against New England. The team again reached the Open Cup final but lost to the Columbus Crew.\n\nVictory in the MLS Cup earned the team another berth in the 2003 CONCACAF Champions' Cup. Los Angeles advanced past Motagua in the first round but fell against Necaxa in the quarterfinals. In MLS, the club had its first losing season with a 9–12–9 record and no victories on the road. The Galaxy failed to score goals consistently during the year, managing only a fourth-place finish in the five-team Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, Los Angeles defeated San Jose 2–0 in the first leg, but during the second leg, conceded five goals in the second half of the match and were eliminated. Schmid was criticized by fans and the press speculated he would not return in 2004.<ref name=\"CNN/SI 2003-11-26\"></ref> A local writer put some of the blame on a switch to defensive style of play while some players questioned his tactics. After it was announced that he would remain in his role next season, Schmid expected a year of rebuilding the team. The following year, he was picked to coach the Western Conference in the All-Star game. Midway through the season, with the Galaxy in first place, Schmid was fired after a five-game stretch without any wins, in which the team scored only three goals. General manager Doug Hamilton said that the team had a mission \"to compete for and win championships\", and that \"a more entertaining and attractive product on the field.\" was needed. Schmid left with an overall record of 79–53–32 with a 16–7–3 mark in the playoffs.\n\nReflecting on his demeanor in Los Angeles, Lalas said Schmid had \"epic explosions\". One reporter called him \"combustible\", while another referred to him as \"fiery\". Lalas also commented that playing for Schmid in Los Angeles required professionalism on and off the field.\n\nSchmid returned to the league as coach of the Columbus Crew in 2006, rated by the team's general manager Mark McCullers as \"the best coach in America\". The team contained young talent but lacked depth and had no star players. In August, after a streak of 13 winless matches, Schmid considered resigning. The team suffered from injuries and inconsistent lineups throughout the season, finishing last in the Eastern Conference with just 30 goals, the lowest in the league.\n\nBy the start of 2007, Schmid had rebuilt the roster, keeping only three players he had inherited and acquiring Argentine attacker Guillermo Barros Schelotto. Schmid cut the Crew's goalkeeper, Jon Busch, who had been with the team for five years. Schmid had concerns over Busch's playing style and fitness. Busch later criticized Schmid's management skills, and said he would never work for the coach again, but gave credit to Schmid's tactical approach. Scheletto's contributions were crucial to Columbus's improvement that season, but the team failed to make the playoffs. A writer for ESPN speculated that the Crew suffered because the team management would not spend more money, while Schmid lamented that he could not attract a foreign star to the little-known city of Columbus.\n\nThe Crew's performance improved remarkably in the 2008 season. Schmid adjusted their offensive tactics to be based on ball possession and flank speed. He made Schelotto a central part of the plan in a roaming playmaker position, a role in which Schelotto excelled and the Argentinian was named the league's MVP. With a 1–0 victory over the Houston Dynamo at Crew Stadium on April 26, Schmid became the second MLS coach to win 100 regular-season games. The Crew went on to win the Supporters' Shield with the best record in the league. In the playoffs, Columbus defeated the New York Red Bulls 3–1 at Schmid's former home stadium, Los Angeles's Home Depot Center, to win the MLS Cup. Schmid received the Coach of the Year Award for the second time. Part of the success was attributed to Schmid's restructuring of the squad in 2006 and 2007.\n\nSchmid declined a contract offer from Columbus after the 2008 season and became coach of Seattle Sounders. The Crew's ownership believed that Schmid had been in contact with Sounders despite being denied permission to talk to other teams during the season. It was also alleged that he shared confidential information with Seattle after his contract with the Crew had ended. The MLS ruled that no tampering had occurred, but ordered Sounders FC to financially compensate the Crew.\n\nSchmid was named the first coach of the new expansion franchise, Seattle Sounders FC. In their 2009 inaugural season, Seattle defeated D.C. United to win the U.S. Open Cup. On October 24, 2009, Seattle defeated FC Dallas 2–1, giving Schmid his 125th career MLS regular season win; this win moved Schmid past Bob Bradley for the most wins in MLS history. He led Seattle to the playoffs where, in the first round, the Dynamo defeated the team 1–0 in overtime of the second leg. Seattle was the first expansion team to make the playoffs in an inaugural season since the 1998 Chicago Fire, when the league was just two years old.\nThe team began the 2010 MLS season slowly with injuries to key players that impacted Schmid's starting lineups. The team had a record of 4–8–3 over the first 15 games. The Sounders also advanced through the preliminary round of the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League but failed to get past the group stage. The 2010 U.S. Open Cup campaign culminated in Schmid winning his third championship with a 2–1 victory over the Crew at Seattle's Qwest Field. No MLS team had previously won back-to-back Open Cups. The Sounders rebounded in the second half of the regular season with a 10–2–3 record to qualify for the playoffs. The team faced Bruce Arena's Galaxy in the two-legged quarter-final. Both coaches are considered to be among the best in the MLS, and it was the first meeting between the two in the playoffs. The Sounders lost by a 3–1 aggregate and Arena moved within one game of Schmid's MLS postseason record of 19 wins.\n\nIn 2011, Schmid's Sounders FC had many setbacks and a slow start to the season (the club won just 3 of its first 10 matches). Schmid signed a long-term contract extension on July 14, 2011, which could keep him with the club through the 2015 MLS season. The extension is dependent on some club options and performance triggers. Although some fans had become frustrated with what they saw as tactical inflexibility and mismanagement of players, general manager Adrian Hanauer praised Schmid's professionalism and success. The Sounders went on to finish the regular season with the second-best record in the league at 18 wins, 7 losses, 9 draws, and qualified for the playoffs for a third consecutive year. Schmid again led his club to the final of the U.S. Open Cup tournament. They defeated the Chicago Fire 2–0 to become the first team since 1968 to win the tournament three times consecutively. Seattle also advanced to the knock-out stages of the CONCACAF Champions League. However, in the MLS playoffs, Sounders FC was again eliminated from the MLS Cup playoffs in the conference semifinal round by Real Salt Lake.\nIn 2012, Seattle lost in the 2-legged 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League quarter finals by an aggregate score of 7–3 to Santos Laguna. The Sounders advanced to the finals of the Open Cup where they were defeated by Sporting Kansas City after penalty kicks. Schmid was furious over what he saw as a controversial call that handed Kansas City the victory. The team finished the regular season with a 15–8–11 record to make the playoffs where they advanced past Real Salt Lake to reach the conference championship series against the Galaxy. The team played defensive and suffered a 3–0 blowout in the first leg. They won on the return leg but lost on aggregate.\n\nThe Sounders began the 2013 regular season without a win until their sixth match. After advancing through the early stages of the 2012–13 CONCACAF Champions League the year prior, Seattle lost in the semifinals to Santos Laguna. The team was knocked out of the 2013 Open Cup in their first match against the lower division Tampa Bay Rowdies. Seattle would rally during the middle of the season to put the Supporter's Shield and the regional Cascadia Cup in reach. However, the team ended the season on a skid of seven matches without a win that included substantial losses to both Colorado and rival Vancouver. The Sounders beat Colorado in the knockout round of the 2013 MLS Cup Playoffs before losing two matches against arch-rival Portland. At the end of the season, a poll in \"The Seattle Times\" showed that many fans wanted to see Schmid fired. Pundits speculated on the possibility of his termination based on what they saw as poor tactics, a history of mismanaging skilled players, and a fan base that had higher expectations. Owner Joe Roth held a post-season meeting with Hanauer and Schmid. Roth later said that the possibility of Schmid losing his job was \"close\", but instead opted for personnel changes to the squad.\n\nConsequently, Schmid met with a core group of players represented by Osvaldo Alonso, Clint Dempsey, and Brad Evans. The group agreed on changes to the team. Starting striker Eddie Johnson was later traded while a new central defender, winger, midfielder, goalkeeper, and depth at the forward position were brought in. The team played 2014 with Dempsey and Obafemi Martins playing more through the middle as the Sounders won the US Open Cup and the Supporters Shield.\nHe spent part of the 2015–16 offseason with AS Roma to study their training methods. During the first half of the 2016 season, the Sounders failed to meet expectations, placing near the bottom of the league with 6 wins, 12 losses, and 2 draws. After a 3–0 loss on July 24 to Sporting Kansas City, in which the Sounders had only one shot, Schmid left the club on mutual terms and was replaced by assistant coach Brian Schmetzer.\n\nAfter leaving the Sounders, Schmid joined ESPN as a studio analyst.\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the LA Galaxy named Schmid as their new coach, replacing Curt Onalfo—the assistant coach and successor to Bruce Arena, who had departed the Galaxy in November 2016 to take over the United States men's national team. Under Onalfo, the Galaxy had lost half of their 20 matches and were on a five-match losing streak in mid-July, missing several key players to injuries. Schmid's first match for the Galaxy in 2017 ended in a scoreless draw against the Seattle Sounders, but the team would only win two matches before ending the season in last place—missing the playoffs for the first time since 2008 and the fourth time in their history.\n\nSchmid was given greater powers related to player personnel decisions by the Galaxy, similar to that of Arena's tenure and replacing roles served by general manager Pete Vagenas, and looked to enter the 2018 season with a \"winning\" roster. During the offseason, the Galaxy overhauled its roster and declined to re-sign several starting players, including captain Jermaine Jones and homegrown player Gyasi Zardes. Schmid replaced the core team with free agents and trades from other MLS teams, including Perry Kitchen, Chris Pontius, Ola Kamara, and David Bingham. The Galaxy also signed star striker Zlatan Ibrahimović, who Schmid hoped would be a \"positive impact\" on the team.\n\nThe Galaxy started the season with injuries to key players and some of its new arrivals. The team scored an early victory against new rival Los Angeles FC in the inaugural match of \"El Tráfico\", with Ibrahimović debuting as a substitute and leading the team to a 4–3 win. The Galaxy then slipped and lost four matches in a row, several by a single goal, but recovered and embarked on a nine-match unbeaten streak that lasted until August. The Galaxy then failed to win its next five matches under Schmid and slipped to eighth place in the Western Conference, conceding 11 goals in two away matches to Seattle and Salt Lake. Schmid resigned from the Galaxy on September 10, 2018, and was replaced by assistant coach Dominic Kinnear. Kinnear replaced Schmid's 3–5–2 formation with a conventional 4–4–2 lineup and returned the team to playoff contention, but ultimately failed to clinch a playoff berth.\n\nSchmid lived in Bellevue, Washington, during the soccer season. He was married to Valerie Schmid and had four children: Erik, Lacey, Kurt, and Kyle. Kurt has been the head scout for Sounders FC and was also the Director of Player Personnel and Scouting for the L.A. Galaxy. Kyle played as a defender at UC Irvine and was in the USL Premier Development League with Orange County Blue Star. Kyle is now an assistant coach at Cal State Fullerton. Sigi rarely missed game days in MLS, but took time off for Lacey and Kurt's weddings and Kurt's college graduation. Schmid's younger brother, Roland, lived in Sammamish, Washington, and having family in the area was one of the factors which persuaded Schmid to accept the Seattle job. After leaving the Galaxy in September 2018, Schmid stated that he planned to join another MLS club's front office or write a book.\n\nSchmid was hospitalized several times during his later career, including once for a bout of pneumonia in 2009 and again for an undisclosed issue in 2015 that required him to miss a regular season match with the Sounders.\n\nSchmid had weight and heart issues that later factored into his decision to retire from the LA Galaxy in 2018. Schmid was hospitalized on December 10, 2018, in Los Angeles and placed in intensive care at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center while awaiting a heart transplant.

They provide potable water, cheap transportation, electricity, and the livelihood for many people nationwide. This easily explains why nearly all the major cities of India are located by the banks of rivers. The rivers also have an important role in Hindu Religion and are considered holy by all Hindus in the country.\n\nSeven major rivers along with their numerous tributaries make up the river system of India. The largest basin system of the rivers pour their waters into the Bay of Bengal; however, some of the rivers whose courses take them through the western part of the country and towards the east of the state of Himachal Pradesh empty into the Arabian Sea. Parts of Ladakh, northern parts of the Aravalli range and the arid parts of the Thar Desert have inland drainage.\n\nAll major rivers of India originate from one of the following main watersheds:\n\n\nHimalayan glaciers in the Indian subcontinent are broadly divided into the three river basins, namely the Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra. The Indus basin has the largest number of glaciers (3500), whereas the Ganga and Brahmaputra basins contain about 1000 and 660 glaciers, respectively. Ganga is the largest river system in India. However these rivers are just three among many. Other examples are Narmada, Tapi, and Godavari.\n\nThe Indo gangetic plains are known as \"Ganga-Satluj Ka Maidaan\" (गँगा सतलुज का मैदान), this area is drained by 16 major rivers. The major Himalayan Rivers are the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra. These rivers are long, and are joined by many large and important tributaries. Himalayan rivers have long courses from their source to sea (in India Arabian sea and Bay of Bengal).\nFollowing rivers flow from the Aravalli range, both northwards to Yamuna as well as southwards to Arabian Sea.\n\n\nThe major rivers in this system are (in order of merging, from west to east)\nBefore entering Bangladesh, Ganga leaves a distributary Hoogly, which provides water for irrigation in West Bengal.\n\n\nThe Indus River originates in the northern slopes of the Kailash range near Lake Manasarovar in Tibet. Although most of the river's course runs through neighbouring Pakistan, as per as regulation of Indus water treaty of 1960, India can use only 20 percent of the water in this river. A portion of it does run through Indian territory, as do parts of the courses of its five major tributaries, listed below. These tributaries are the source of the name of the Punjab of South Asia; the name is derived from the panch (\"five\") and \"aab\" (\"water\"), hence the combination of the words (\"Punjab\") means \"land with the water of five rivers\". The Indus is long.\n\nThe major rivers in Indus river system are (in order of their length):\n\n\nIndia experiences an average precipitation of per year, or about of rains annually. Some 80 percent of its area experiences rains of or more a year. However, this rain is not uniform in time or geography. Most of the rains occur during its monsoon seasons (June to September), with the northeast and north receiving far more rains than India's west and south. Other than rains, the melting of snow year round over the Himalayas feeds the northern rivers to varying degrees. The southern rivers, however experience more flow variability over the year. For the Himalayan basin, this leads to flooding in some months and water scarcity in others. Despite extensive river system, safe clean drinking water as well as irrigation water supplies for sustainable agriculture are in shortage across India, in part because it has, as yet, harnessed a small fraction of its available and recoverable surface water resource. India harnessed (20 percent) of its water resources in 2010, part of which came from unsustainable use of groundwater. Of the water it withdrew from its rivers and groundwater wells, India dedicated about to irrigation, to municipal and drinking water applications and to industry.\n\nAccording to 2011 report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, India's basin wise distribution of catchment area and utilizable surface water resources is presented in the following table:\n\nThe main water divide in peninsular rivers is formed by the Western Ghats, which run from north to south close to the western coast. Most of the major rivers of the peninsula such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal. These rivers make delta at their mouths. The Narmada, Periyar and Tapti are the only long rivers, which flow west and make estuaries.\n\n"}

He was a member of the Alberta New Democratic Party for the district of Athabasca-Lac La Biche.\n\nPiquette is largely remembered for what would come to be known as the \"Piquette Affair.\" On April 7, 1987, Piquette attempted to ask a question in French in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Speaker David J. Carter twice prevented him from asking the question, ruling that English was the only language permitted in the legislature. Piquette appeared before a special hearing of the legislature's Election and Privilege Committee to argue the legislature had a duty to let members speak both English and French. He relied on section 110 of the \"Northwest Territories Act\", which provided that members of the Northwest Territories legislature could use both English and French in debates. Piquette reasoned that the \"Act\" (which governed the territory that contained Alberta before Alberta became a province in 1905) had never been repealed, and was still in effect.\n\nThe incident sparked two rallies at the legislature in April and December 1987, where hundreds of francophones from across Alberta demonstrated in support of francophone language rights. \nIn February 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision in \"R. v. Mercure\", [1988] 1 S.C.R. 234. The Court ruled that s. 110 continued in force in both Saskatchewan and Alberta but also held that the legislatures of those provinces could unilaterally modify these language rights. The Alberta Legislature responded by allowing members to speak in French, but only if they provided the Speaker with a written translation of their comments, in advance.\n\nAfter his electoral defeat in 1989, Léo Piquette stayed active in the francophone community and provincial politics. In 1994, he helped pioneer francophone education in Alberta after the Alberta government granted francophone parents the right to francophone schools. He became a school board member of the \"Conseil Scolaire Centre-Est\" in 1994 and was Chair of the Board until 2004 when he was elected as President of the \"Fédération des Conseils Scolaires de l'Alberta\".

Along with his contemporary New York critics Richard Aldrich, Henry Finck, W.J. Henderson, and James Huneker, he was part of the first generation of American critics to establish a uniquely American school of criticism. A critic with a strong bend towards empiricism, he frequently sought out first hand experiences, accounts and primary sources when writing; drawing his own conclusions rather than looking to what other writers had already written. A meliorist, Krehbiel believed that the role of criticism was largely to support music that uplifted the human spirit and intellect, and that criticism should serve not only as a means of taste making but also as a mode to educate the public. His book \"How to Listen to Music\" (in print from 1896 to 1924) was widely used as an instructional guide by the music consuming public in the United States during the last years of the 19th century and first several decades of the 20th century. \n\nAs a critic he was particularly complimentary of German romanticism, and was a great admirer and promoter in the United States of Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Schumann, and especially Richard Wagner and his musical theories. He was a close friend and admirer of the conductor Anton Seidl who greatly enhanced his appreciation for Wagner and his music, and whose work he gave his most complimentary reviews. He was not so complimentary to Wagner's main successors: Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler, and was also critical towards French impressionism and works of the Italian school. \n\nKrehbiel was a champion of the music of Antonín Dvořák whom he hoped would help establish an authentically American school of music when Dvořák was appointed head of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City in 1892. Already an admirer of folk music, Krehbiel was inspired by Dvořák's work as a folk song collector and composer, and spent many years researching and collecting folk songs from Americans and immigrants. He collected the folk songs of Magyars, Scandinavians, Russians, Native Americans, and African Americans. This work resulted in numerous publications, including the first book published on African-American spirituals \"Afro-American folksongs: a study in racial and national music\" (1914). He also served as annotator for the programs of the concerts by the New York Philharmonic, and translated several German opera libretti for performance or publication in English. He also translated Alexander Wheelock Thayer's seminal three volume German language biography on Beethoven for its 1921 English language publication. Thayer had left a planned fourth volume unwritten at the time of his death, and Krehbiel wrote a fourth volume to complete the series in his final years. It was published posthumously in 1925 for the second publishing of his English translation.\nKrehbiel was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1854, the son of a German clergyman of the Methodist Episcopal Church. A first generation American, he was educated by his father, and grew up in a bilingual household speaking, reading, and writing in both German and English. He later mastered the French, Italian, Russian, and Latin languages. In 1864 his family moved to Cincinnati where his father took up the post of clergymen at a Methodist Church. There, Henry became the conductor of the church's choir while just a youth. In 1872 he began the study of law in Cincinnati, Ohio. In June, 1874, he was attached to the staff of the \"Cincinnati Gazette\" where he began his career as a writer on sports and crime, reporting mainly on baseball games and murders. He quickly progressed to reporting on music events, and remained with the paper in that post until November 1880.\n\nHe then went to New York, where he joined the staff of \"The New York Tribune\", initially as a journalist attached to the city desk who ocassionally wrote editorials. As in Cincinnati, he quickly progressed to covering music events and rapidly rose to post of musical editor. He became an influential music critic, writing many articles for the \"Tribune\", \"Scribner's Monthly\", and other journals. In researching his articles, he would often seek out first hand experiences, and do his own unique research exhuming primary sources. For example, when writing on Wagner's \"Die Meistersinger\", he traveled to Nuremberg, and when writing on cantorial chant, he attended synagogues. \n\nKrehbiel wrote many books about various aspects of music, including \"Afro-American folksongs: a study in racial and national music\" (1914); one of the earliest examinations of African American music. His interest in the music was African-Americans dates back to his attendance of World's Columbian Exposition where he was enthralled with performances of music by black musicians at the Midway Plaisance. He annotated concert programs (including many of Paderewski's recitals).\n\nKrehbiel translated some opera libretti, including: Nicolai's \"Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor\" (1886), Paderewski's \"Manru\" (1902), and Mozart's \"Der Schauspieldirektor\" (1916). (Dates given are the first performance of the English translation.) When Mozart's \"Così fan tutte\" was performed for the first time in the US, in 1922, it was in a new English version with a text by Krehbiel. He also translated the three volume German language biography of Beethoven written by Alexander Wheelock Thayer, for its first English language publication in 1921. A fourth volume had been planned but was left incompleted by Thayer at the time of his death in 1897. Krehbiel penned his own fourth volume numbering 1,137 pages which was included in the 1925 republication of his English language translation. \n\nKrehbiel was a strong supporter of music by Wagner, Brahms, Dvořák, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky when they were not yet well known in America. He detested French music, and together with his assistant, Richard Aldrich, he waged a continuing campaign against it. After Debussy's \"La mer\" was introduced in the US in 1907, Krehbiel wrote:\n\nIt caused some amusement when after Debussy's work became a staple of the orchestral repertoire Krehbiel felt obliged write in 1922 that \"La mer\" was \"a poetic work in which Debussy has so wondrously caught the rhythms and colors of the seas.\" He was also highly critical of Gustav Mahler, both as a conductor and composer, once describing him as \"a prophet of the ugly\", and attacked Strauss for embracing hedonist themes in his works which he viewed as an amoral subject that did not uplift humanity as great music should. \n\nWhen Krehbiel died in March 1923, still in post as critic of \"The New York Tribune\", Aldrich wrote in a tribute that Krehbiel had been \"the leading musical critic of America\" who raised musical criticism to an eminence it had never previously enjoyed in the US.\n\n\n"}

Tarkovsky co-wrote the screenplay with Tonino Guerra.\n\nThe film depicts a Russian writer (Oleg Yankovsky) who visits Italy to carry out research about an 18th-century Russian composer, but is stricken by homesickness. The film utilizes autobiographical elements drawn from Tarkovsky's own experiences visiting Italy, and explores themes surrounding nostalgia and the untranslatability of art and culture.\n\nThe film won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury, the prize for best director and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival. The film received nine total votes in the 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" polls of the greatest films ever made.\n\nThe Russian writer Andrei Gorchakov (Oleg Yankovsky) travels to Italy to research the life of 18th-century Russian composer Pavel Sosnovsky, who lived there and committed suicide after his return to Russia. He and his comely interpreter Eugenia travel to a convent in the Tuscan countryside, to look at frescoes by Piero della Francesca. Andrei decides at the last minute that he does not want to enter.\n\nBack at their hotel Andrei feels displaced and longs to go back to Russia, but unnamed circumstances seem to get in the way. Eugenia is smitten with Andrei and is offended that he will not sleep with her, claiming that she has a better boyfriend waiting for her.\n\nAndrei meets and befriends a strange man named Domenico (Erland Josephson), who is famous in the village for trying to cross through the waters of a mineral pool with a lit candle. He claims that when finally achieving it, he will save the world. They both share a feeling of alienation from their surroundings. Andrei later learns that Domenico used to live in a lunatic asylum until the post-fascistic state closed them and now lives in the street. He also learns that Domenico had a family and was obsessed in keeping them inside his house in order to save them from the end of the world, until they were freed by the local police after seven years. Before leaving, Domenico gives Andrei his candle and asks him if he will cross the waters for him with the flame.\n\nDuring a dream-like sequence, Andrei sees himself as Domenico and has visions of his wife, Eugenia and the Mary as being all one and the same. Andrei seems to cut his research short and plans to leave for Russia, until he gets a call from Eugenia, who wishes to say goodbye and tell him that she met Domenico in Rome by chance and that he asked if Andrei has walked across the pool himself as he promised. Andrei says he has, although that is not true. Eugenia is with her boyfriend, but he seems uninterested in her and appears to be involved in dubious business affairs. Later, Domenico delivers a speech in the city about the need of mankind of being true brothers and sisters and to return to a simpler way of life. Finally, he plays the fourth movement of Beethoven's Ninth and immolates himself. Meanwhile, Andrei returns to the mineral pool in Bagno Vignoni (Val d'Orcia) to fulfill his promise, only to find that the pool has been drained. He enters the empty pool and repeatedly attempts to walk from one end to the other without letting the candle extinguish. As he finally achieves his goal, he collapses. (This shot has a duration of 9:07.)\n\n\nThis was Andrei Tarkovsky's first film directed outside of the U.S.S.R. It was to be filmed in Italy with the support of Mosfilm, with most of the dialogue in Italian. The film was in pre-production as far back as 1980. Initially the film was titled \"Viaggio in Italia\" (\"Voyage to Italy\"), but since there was already the film \"Journey to Italy\" (1954) by Roberto Rossellini, starring Ingrid Bergman, that already bore that name, they searched for something else, eventually deciding upon \"Nostalghia.\" When Mosfilm support was withdrawn, Tarkovsky used part of the budget provided by Italian State Television and French film company Gaumont to complete the film in Italy and cut some Russian scenes from the script, while recreating Russian locations for other scenes in Italy. Luciano Tovoli was considered for director of photography, although ultimately Giuseppe Lanci shot the film, though Tovoli would take that role in Tarkovsky’s 1982 documentary \"Tempo di Viaggio\", or \"Voyage in Time\".\n\nDonatella Baglivo filmed a ninety minute documentary on the making of the film titled \"Andrei Tarkovsky in Nostalghia\" (1984)\",\" providing a fascinating glimpse into the making of the film, including interviews with cast and crew.\n\nAnatoly Solonitsyn was initially cast as Andrei Gorchakov, but died from cancer in 1982, forcing Tarkovsky to seek a new protagonist, eventually deciding upon Oleg Yankovsky who had appeared in his previous film \"The Mirror\"\".\"\n\nSeveral scenes of the film were set in the countryside of Tuscany and northern Lazio; as the Abbey of San Galgano, the spas of Bagno Vignoni, the Orcia Valley, in the Province of Siena, the mysterious crypt of the Chiesa di San Pietro (Tuscania) and the flooded church of Church of Santa Maria in San Vittorino of Cittaducale, in the Province of Rieti.\n\nSimilarly to Tarkovsky's previous films, \"Nostalghia\" utilizes long takes, dream sequences, and minimal story. Of his use of dream sequences, to the question asked by Gian Luigi Rondi: “A realism of dream, like that of Mirror?\"”\" Tarkovsky answered: “There isn’t 'realism' on the one hand, and on the other hand (in contrast, in contradiction) 'dreams.' We spend a third of our life asleep (and thus dreaming): what is there that is more real than dreams?”\n\nTarkovsky spoke of the profound form of nostalgia which he believes is unique to Russians when traveling abroad, comparing it to a disease, \"an illness that drains away the strength of the soul, the capacity to work, the pleasure of living\", but also, \"a profound compassion that binds us not so much with our own privation, our longing, our separation, but rather with the suffering of others, a passionate empathy.\"\n\nTarkovsky's goal in \"Nostalghia,\" in terms of style, was to portray the soul, the memory, of Italy, of which it felt to him being there. When he visited Italy to begin studying the project of \"Nostalghia\" with Tonino Guerra, as they visited cities Tonino would show him Renaissance architecture, art, monuments, and he admired them, and would take notes, but what struck him the most was the sky, the blue sky, black sky, with clouds, with the sun, at dawn, at noon, in the evening. A sky, he said, is always simply just that, but a change in the hour of the day, the wind, climate, can have it speak to you in a different way, with love, violence, longing, fear, etc. Cinema, he said, can give these \"ways\" back to you and that it must, with courage, and honest, always starting from the real.\n\nAccording to Tarkovsky, while shooting the film he realized that he would be able to express \"something distinctive\", which he believed he couldn't in his previous films – for only then he had become aware that \"a film can make the inner life of its author visible\", and, thereby, he \"expanded into [himself].\"\n\nThe film features music by Ludwig van Beethoven, and Giuseppe Verdi (Requiem), as well as Russian folk songs. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is featured both during Andrei's visit at Domenico's home and during his demonstration in Rome.\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" said that Tarkovsky \"may well be a film poet but he's a film poet with a tiny vocabulary. [...] Nothing happens.\" Dave Kehr was mildly positive, considering it to be \"packed with imagery that seems at once hopelessly obscure and crushingly obvious\" while also arguing that the work \"does succeed in inducing some kind of trance.\" The film won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury, the prize for best director and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival. Tarkovsky also shared a special prize called \"Grand Prix du cinéma de creation\" with Robert Bresson. Soviet authorities prevented the film from winning the Palme d'Or, a fact that hardened Tarkovsky's resolve to never work in the Soviet Union again.\n\nIt is today one of Tarkovsky's lesser-known works. In 2010, scholar Thomas Redwood wrote that \"critics on the whole have tended to ignore the film. Relatively little has been written about \"Nostalghia\" and even less has been understood of it.\" Not without its admirers, the film holds an 89% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and received nine total votes in the 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" polls of the greatest films ever made.\n\n"}

The story set in Ooty revolves around tourist guide Joji (Mohanlal) and photographer Nishchal (Jagathy Sreekumar). They happen to meet a lavish tourist Nandini (Revathi), whom they bet their fortunes on. It also stars Thilakan, Innocent, K. B. Ganesh Kumar, Sukumari, and Sharat Saxena, with Murali and Jagadish making cameo appearances. The music was composed by S. P. Venkatesh.\n\n\"Kilukkam\" was released on 15 August 1991. The film was the highest-grossing Malayalam film at that time and ran for more than 365-days at the theaters. \"Kilukkam\" won five Kerala State Film Awards, including Best Actor for Mohanlal, Second Best Actor for Jagathy Sreekumar, Best Editor for N. Gopalakrishnan, and Best Cinematographer for S. Kumar. The film is regarded as one of the best comedy films of Malayalam cinema.\n\n\"Kilukkam\" was remade in Telugu as \"Allari Pilla\" and in Hindi as \"Muskurahat\" by Priyadarshan himself. The film spawned a sequel, \"Kilukkam Kilukilukkam\", released in 2006.\n\nJoji (Mohanlal) is a tourist guide in Ootacamund, down on his luck. Nandini (Revathy), a tourist, who is mentally challenged, and a series of events make her presence intertwined with the lives of Joji and his friend Nischal (Jagathy Sreekumar). In the early part of the movie, hilarity ensues in their misguided attempts in getting rid of Nandini. However, they find out that she is an escaped mental patient who has a bounty on her safe return. When they find that the bounty has been increasing for a while, they decide to hide her for a while and claim the bounty when it gets big enough. They change her appearance by cutting her long tresses short. In time, they realize that things are not as they seem, and more complications are unraveled.\n\nThe initial plan for the film was set when Priyadarshan met \"Goodknight\" Mohan in an airport. The story was developed by Priyadarshan from a thought which came to his mind, about a mentally-ill mischievous girl who is saved by a poor guy. Priyadarshan employed Venu Nagavally for screenwriting the film. The film's title was chosen as \"Kilukkam\", since the character of Nandini is introduced in the film with the clink of her anglets when she jump off a train and she is all perky like a kilukkampetti (a toy box that makes clinking sound). The story of a girl who has to face some miseries in her lifeit was the idea Priyadarshan initially intended for the film. While working on the story he met director Fazil and discussed the idea. Fazil at the time was directing \"Ente Sooryaputhrikku\" (1991). He told Priyadarshan to \"reverse think\" the story of \"Ente Sooryaputhrikku\", which was about a girl trying to find her mother. And in \"Kilukkam\" it became, a girl trying to find her father.\n\nMohanlal, who is the usual choice of Priyadarshan was the protagonist in mind from the initial stage itself. Amala who was acting in Priyadarshan's Telugu film \"Nirnayam\" at the time, was signed for the role of Nandini. She gave dates from 3 March 1991 to 4 April. Priyadarshan's initial chose for Nischal was Sreenivasan, but he was unavailable during his scheduled date due to another commitment. Hence, Priyadarshan opted for Jagathy Sreekumar, to whom he asked 30 days continuous dates. Sreekumar, at the time, busy acting in multiple films at a time, gave his continuous dates for a long period for the first time. The film's pooja function was held at Kothandapani Studio in Madras (now Chennai). The recording of songs started at the same day in the studio by S. P. Venkatesh. By the time of commencement of filming, Amala got married and had to opt out from the film as her father-in-law Akkineni Nageswara Rao announced her retirement soon after that. She was replaced by Revathi. Jagadish played a pivotal character in the film as a still photographer, the professional rivalry of Nischal, but in the final cut of the film, his portions were cut short to a minor role for reducing the running time.\n\nPrincipal photography began in March 1991 in Ooty, which was the main location where the film is set. In Ooty, The Fernhills Palace was the central location, which was shot as the bungalow of Justice Pillai, played by Thilakan. The mist is utilised in the film to the maximum. The major part of the filming took place early in the morning because the mist lasted for a couple of hours only and the makers wanted to capitalise the mist-covered location. One of the initial scenes in the film, where Mohanlal and Thilakan takes morning walks, are shot in a secluded location in Ooty that was accidentally discovered by the team. They wanted the place to look classy and so the lamp post, a couple of chairs and all those fallen leaves. They painted leaves were brought to the location in a lorry and were scattered to resemble natural foliage.\n\nWhile filming the song \"Ootyppattanam\", Mohanlal escaped from what would have been a fatal injury. A sequence in the song was shot over the top of a moving train, where Mohanlal was standing opposite Jagathi and Revathy. There was a leaning electric line over the train passage, which the production team did not notice. While performing, all of a sudden, Sreekumar instructed Mohanlal to lie low, which he immediately obeyed without questioning. The line just touched his hair. In a later interview, Priyadarshan said that, he never laughed while filming \"Kilukkam\", he believed that if they laugh in the sets, the audience will not get that laugh in theatres. Several unscripted dialogues were used by Mohanlal and Revathi in their combination scenes.\n\n\"Kilukkam\" was released on 15 August 1991, in 32 centres in Kerala. Within 50 days run, it grossed 1.59 crore from the releasing stations. \"Kilukkam\" ran for over 365-days at many releasing centres and was the first Malayalam film to gross over 5 crore from theatrical revenue. \"Kilukkam\" was the highest-grossing film ever in Malayalam film history at the time. The film is often regarded as a classic, it is considered as one of the best comedy films ever made in Malayalam cinema.\n\nIn a later interview, Priyadarshan has said that he exploited the Mohanlal Sreekumar chemistry to the maximum and incorporated certain elements of emotions in the film unlike his earlier comedy films \"Aram + Aram = Kinnaram\" (1985) and \"Boeing Boeing\" (1985), which made the film one of the all-time hits in Malayalam.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, the executives of Ultra Rays 3D Technologies Private Ltd in Kochi approached Priyadarshan and Ram Mohan for talks for the 3D conversion of \"Kilukkam\". In that case, \"Kilukkam\" would become the first Malayalam film to be converted into 3D. Priyadarshan confirmed the news that the company approached him but the final call should be made by the producer Ram Mohan. In the \"Times of India\" report in late 2012, Mohan said that nothing has been finalised, discussions are going on.\n"}

He is the author of three published novels, \"The House of Blue Mangoes\" (2002), \"The Solitude of Emperors\" (2007), and \"Ithaca\" (2011). In parallel to his writing career, Davidar has been a publisher for over a quarter-century. He is the co-founder of Aleph Book Company, a literary publishing firm based in New Delhi.\n\nDavid Davidar was born in Nagercoil, Kanyakumari district, in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. His father was a tea planter in Kerala, and his mother was a teacher. Davidar grew up in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and both states feature prominently in his fiction. He has one sibling, Ruth Swamy, a nutritionist and dietician.\n\nHe attended Sainik School, Amaravathinagar, in Tiruppur district, and then earned a BSc degree in Botany from Madras Christian College in 1979. In 1985, he obtained a diploma in publishing from the Radcliffe Publishing Procedures Course at Harvard University\n\nDavidar has been married to Rachna Singh, a bookseller, since 1997. She has worked at The Bookshop in New Delhi, which her family owns, as well as at bookstores in Canada, among them, Nicholas Hoare, Ben McNally Books, and McNally Robinson.\n\nIn 2010, after he was accused by a former colleague of sexual harassment, Davidar and Penguin, his then-employer, parted ways. He dismissed the allegations, maintaining he'd had a consensual, flirtatious relationship with the complainant. The charges were dropped after the parties involved reached a settlement.\n\nDavidar began a career in journalism after graduating from college. His first job, in 1979, was with the Bombay-based activist magazine \"Himmat,\" which was founded by Rajmohan Gandhi, the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi. When that magazine closed down, Davidar joined a features magazine called \"Keynote,\" which was edited by the distinguished poet Dom Moraes, and his actress wife, Leela Naidu. His last job in journalism was with another features magazine called \"Gentleman\" where he was Executive Editor.

The novel, which was based on Davidar's own family, and covered fifty years of South Indian history, had been twelve years in the writing. It was greeted with acclaim throughout the English-speaking world and was eventually published in sixteen countries and translated into as many languages. Among the newspapers and magazines which praised the novel were \"The New York Times\" which called it \"a polished and accomplished book\", London's \"Sunday Times\" which thought it was \"dazzling\" and the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" which said Davidar was \"an intriguing new voice\".\n\nDavidar's second novel, \"The Solitude of Emperors\", which was based on his experiences as a journalist, and the outrage he felt at the communal riots that took place in India in the 1990s, was published in 2007, and was short-listed for a Commonwealth Writers Prize.\n\nHis third novel, \"Ithaca\", set in the world of international publishing, was published in Fall 2011. It was praised by several newspapers; \"The Hindu\" said it provided \"a fascinating insight into the world of publishing\".

Spanish troops led by General José Joaquín de Arredondo defeated republican forces (calling themselves the \"Republican Army of the North\"), consisting of Tejano-Mexican and Tejano-American revolutionaries participating in the Gutiérrez–Magee Expedition, under General José Álvarez de Toledo y Dubois. It was the deadliest battle in Texas history.\n\nBernardo Gutiérrez de Lara took up the effort to free Texas from Spain. Colonel Gutiérrez visited Washington, D.C., gaining some support for his plans. In 1812, Colonel Augustus Magee, who as a lieutenant had commanded U.S. Army troops guarding the border of the Neutral Ground and Spanish Texas, resigned his commission and formed the Republican Army of the North to aid the Gutiérrez–Magee Expedition. The army flew a solid emerald green flag, thought to have been introduced by Colonel Magee, who was of Scots-Irish descent.\n\nNacogdoches was taken on August 12, 1812, with little opposition, and on November 7, 1812, the Republican Army of the North marched into what is present-day Goliad, where they took the Presidio La Bahía. The Spanish Army soon confronted them, beginning a four-month siege. While at La Bahia, however, Colonel Magee died (February 6, 1813). After numerous battles and heavy losses, the Spanish lifted the siege and returned to San Antonio de Bexar.\n\nOn March 25, 1813, the Republican Army of the North left La Bahia for Bexar after receiving reinforcements. Colonel Samuel Kemper (brother of Reuben Kemper (another soldier very familiar with filibustering) replaced Magee, and Lt. Col. Reuben Ross was elected to second in command.\n\nThere were approximately 1,400 Texians in Lara's Republican Army at the time, composed of Tejanos, Americans, Euro-Mexicans (Criollos), former Spanish Royalist soldiers aided by an auxiliary force of Indians, and at least one black slave. The army, being led by General Toledo, had camped on the north bank of the Medina River, about six miles north of Arredondo's 1,800 Royalist troops which were encamped near present-day Leming, Texas.\n\nThe battle lasted for four hours. Toledo's plan called for an ambush on the Royalist troops as they marched through a defile on the Bexar–Laredo road. Similarly, Arredondo had sent out a scouting party with some cavalry in the morning to try to determine the location of Toledo's troops. Quite accidentally, they happened upon the Republican ambush and retreated after a brief exchange of fire.\n\nThe Republican soldiers gave chase, apparently mistaking the cavalry which kicked up large clouds of dust for the main army; it is believed that Toledo tried in vain to stop his troops from advancing. In their pursuit, they were slowed down by the sandy terrain; the guns they were dragging with them became deeply mired. By the time they reached the Spanish lines, they were tired and thirsty. However, they did manage to rout some Spanish artillery units and were attempting a flanking maneuver when they were repulsed by Spanish cavalry units. The situation had been less than clear for Arredondo, and he was prepared to order his troops to fall back, when he seems to have been informed by a defector that the Republican troops were also attempting to disengage due to exhaustion. He then ordered an advance instead.\n\nThe Republicans fled in disorder. Toledo and a few of his associates headed straight for Louisiana. Some of the combatants stopped in San Antonio just long enough to gather their families. The Spanish army continued to press, killing many of the fleeing soldiers. Most of the remainder were captured and then – in a portent of the future Texas War of Independence – were summarily executed. Fewer than 100 out of 1,400 soldiers on the Republican side survived, while the Royalists lost only 55 men. The remains of the Republican troops were left to rot and were not buried until 1822 when José Félix Trespalacios, the first governor of Coahuila y Tejas under the newly established United Mexican States, ordered a detachment of soldiers to gather their bones and bury them honorably under an oak tree that grew on the battlefield.\n\nSome of Guttierrez-Magee participants were sons of American revolutionaries or had fought with Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812, and of the few who survived, some fought again during the second Texas Revolution in 1835–36. José Antonio Navarro, a founding father of Texas and José Francisco Ruiz, both future signers of the 1836 Texas Declaration of Independence, took part in the 1812-13, Magee, Gutiérrez, and Toledo resistance movements and later served as leaders in the Texas Revolution.\n\nOne of the dead, Peter Sides, was an actual veteran of the American Revolution. Sides (originally Seitz) was about 62 when he marched off from his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with Magee and the other revolutionaries. A native of North Carolina of German ancestry, Seitz was a career soldier who fought in the first militia at Nashborough and in Logan County, Kentucky, before he and his family relocated to Baton Rouge in 1799. Markers from the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Daughters of the Republic of Texas have been placed on the battle site in Sides’ honor.\n\nNearly all the names of the other 1,300 or so dead from the Republic Army of the North have been lost to history.\n\nOf a very interesting note is a young lieutenant by the name of Antonio López de Santa Anna fought in this bloody battle and followed his superiors' orders of taking no prisoners, heavily influencing how he would fight wars for the rest of his life, most infamously during the Texas Revolution at the Alamo and Goliad.\n\nThe location of the Battle of Medina has not been archaeologically determined. There are three historical markers for the battle: \n\n\n\n"}

Soon, he was seen worldwide via ANC (ABS-CBN's sister station) as newscaster/anchorman for Dateline News (1998 to 2000) and as program host of \"Kumusta Ka, Bayan\" on The Filipino Channel (TFC). During those years he was also an anchor for the TV show Gising Pilipinas (1997–2003) and Usapang de Campanilla (2000 to 2003) over DZMM 630 AM.\n\nIn 2003, Razon moved to ABS-CBN's rival network GMA-7, where he became one of the hosts of Unang Hirit and anchor of \"Unang Balita\", the show's news segment. He left GMA in 2005.\n\nOn June 16, 2005, it was reported by the \"Manila Bulletin\" that Razon was forced to resign from GMA for the network \"to maintain its neutrality in the midst of the ongoing bitter conflict between the Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ; INC) and the Members Church of God International (ADD). At that time, Razon was the Vice Presiding Minister of MCGI, and the network had been receiving text messages from both Iglesia ni Cristo and \"Ang Dating Daan\" members, each accusing the other of wrongdoing. GMA \"felt being placed in the middle of such conflict will not serve its best interest and decided to let go of Razon.\" The source of INC's complaint stemmed from Razon's pronouncement in MCGI's doctrinal activity in which he said \"You can see demons in Net 25 (a network owned by the INC).\" Razon was quoted in the MCGI website as saying \"I'd rather lose everything than to lose God\" in reaction to the conflict he was facing regarding his job in \"Unang Hirit\" and in ADD.\n\nDaniel, through his morning talk show \"Good Morning Kuya\" and public service program \"Serbisyong Kasangbahay\", started many public service projects such as free medical/dental check-ups and medicines for the indigent.

Each year, eight schools vie to win the two championships: the Juniors and Seniors. If a school wins both championships in one season, it said that they have won the \"double championship.\"\n\nThe tournament commences with a double-round robin of eliminations, where the four teams with the best records advance to the semifinals, with the two top seeds clinching the twice to beat advantage. The winners in the semifinals meet in a best-of-3 Finals series, in order to determine the champion.\n\nThe championship is continually contested since the league's foundation in 1924, except during World War II and the mid-1960s when scandals rocked the league.\n\nThe athletic nicknames of the different teams variously came from the school's founders, or from a distinct quality that separated a school from the others.\n\nNotably, the first champion of this event was crowned in 1925, 14 years before the U.S. NCAA tournament was instituted.\n\nSince 1996, the eight member schools have fielded their varsity teams in a double round elimination tournament, where the schools play each other twice. The four teams with the best records advance to the crossover semifinals, popularly known as the Final Four.\n\nThe two top teams have a twice to beat advantage. The lower ranked teams need to win twice against the higher ranked teams to advance to the best-of-three Finals, where the first team to reach two wins becomes the NCAA basketball champion.\n\n\nIf any event a team finishes the elimination round undefeated, that team will advance outright to the Finals. The third and fourth seed will have a sudden-death game to determine the opponent of the second seed. Then, the winner of the sudden-death match between the second seed and third/fourth seed advances to the Finals to face the first seed. Previously, the first seed holds a twice to beat advantage in the Finals (the Finals would not be a best of three affair), until 2008, the finals was in a best-of-three series even if a team swept the elimination round. Since 2010 the team who sweeps the elimination round will automatically go to the Finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage and a 1-0 edge over their opponent, their opponent needs to beat them thrice while the team who sweeps the 2-round elimination will just have to beat their opponents twice.\n\nPrior to 1998, when the NCAA had, for most part of its history, six teams, it employed a double round robin tournament. The winner of the first round (the team with the highest standing) would notch the first Final berth, while the winner of the second round would notch the second Final berth.\n\nIf a team manages to have the best overall record, yet fails to win either round, that team will play the winner of the second round in a playoff game, to face the winner of the first round in the Championship game. The games of the Championship round are all single-elimination matches, until the 1980s when the Championship game was expanded to a best-of-three series.\n\nIf a team manages to win both rounds (not necessarily a sweep), the Championship round will be omitted, and that team will be declared outright champions.\n\nIn cases of tie, a playoff game will be played to determine which team won the round. If more than two teams are tied, each team will play the teams they are tied with once. If for example, a team won the first round, and is tied with another team for first place at the second round, a playoff game will be played to determine which team wins the round. If the team that won the first round wins in the playoff game, the Championship round will be omitted, since the team won both rounds. If the other team wins, a Championship round will held, since two different teams won the two rounds.\n\nSome of the Letran team players were products of their Varsity High School Team namely: Ted McKinney,Ramon San Juan,William Alberto and were also part of the 1976 National Inter-Secondary Champion Team that was held in Baguio City wherein they beat their NCAA rival San Beda College with the score of 52-51\nIt was a double victory for the Muralla-based cagers as they dominated in winning the Jrs and Srs NCAA Basketball Championship that year. They were also declared the General Champion by the NCAA Management for winning most of the events that the NCAA has provided. It was very sweet for the Knights for getting that award as it was their first time dominating all events.\n\nBasketball, as the most popular sport in the Philippines, receives the most attention from the press and the sports-minded public. As a result, the NCAA Seniors Basketball championship is the most coveted title among the NCAA events.\n\nSan Beda has the most Seniors basketball title a record 20 times, followed by Colegio de San Juan de Letran with 18 and the Ateneo de Manila (now with the University Athletic Association of the Philippines) is third with 14.\nThere is a separate division for high school student-athletes, the Juniors division. San Beda High School has the most titles with 22 while the defunct Mapúa High School won 18.\n\nSan Beda College leads the overall tally with 42 basketball titles, followed by Letran with 28. Among defunct members, Ateneo has the most championships, with 23.\n\nThe current champions are the Colegio de San Juan de Letran Letran Knights (seniors), and the Malayan High School of Science Red Robins (juniors).\n\nWhen a school wins both the Juniors (or Midgets pre-1925) and Seniors tournament at the same season, the school is said to have won the double championship.\n\nAs of 2014, only seven schools were able to win the double championship:\nAteneo de Manila University, San Beda College and San Sebastian College-Recoletos have the most double championships with six apiece. San Beda College also has the most consecutive double championships with five.\n\nLim Eng Beng of the De La Salle Green Archers currently holds the most points scored in an NCAA seniors' game when he scored 55 points in the 1974 season as he led De La Salle Green Archers to the championship. He scored an average of 32 points in that season which remains the all-time record in average points per game in Philippine Men's NCAA.\n\nIn 2009, Joshua Saret of the Jose Rizal Light Bombers scored 89 points against Angeles University Foundation to shatter the all-time high mark set by ex-teammate Keith Agovida at 82 points on September 5, 2008, against Malayan Science HS.\n\nPrior to their record-breaking feats, Letran Squire Marlon Bola Bola held the single-game record of 70 points in 1970.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The headwaters of a tributary, the Lerderderg River, are north of Ballan near Daylesford and it flows across the basalt plain, through the suburb of Werribee to enter Port Phillip. A linear park follows the Werribee River along much of its course. In total the Werribee River completes a journey of approximately .\n\nThe river flows through the Werribee Gorge State Park before being utilised for irrigation of market gardens at Bacchus Marsh, then through Werribee where it is crossed by the Maltby By-pass. It then flows through the Werribee Open Range Zoo in Werribee Park, and finally the small coastal settlement of Werribee South before entering Port Phillip. The Western Treatment Plant, a sewage treatment site, is located near the mouth of the river, and supplies irrigation needs to the zoo.\n\nThe Werribee River Trail winds beside the Werribee River from Davis Creek in Tarneit to the Princes Highway in Werribee.\n\nBefore the arrival of white settlers, the Werribee River was the boundary of the Bunurong tribe whose six clans lived along the Victorian coast across the Mornington Peninsula, Western Port Bay to Wilsons Promontory.\n\nIn the late 1830s and 1840s, the Werribee River was the scene of conflict between the Wautharong people and the European colonisers. The squatter Charles Franks and a shepherd were speared to death near Mount Cottrell in July 1836. This resulted in the Mount Cottrell Massacre - a punitive party led by John Batman which came upon a large party of aborigines and indiscriminately shot and killed at least ten, There are accounts of arsenic laced flour being given to local aborigines.\n\nIn 1851, a substantial timber bridge was built to cross the Werribee River to replace an earlier wooden bridge. In 1852, this bridge was washed away when the Werribee river flooded.\n\nIn August 2004, the Victorian Government pledged 300,000 () towards restoring the Werribee River, removing willows choking the river around the township and replacing them with native plants in a habitat restoration project.\n\nThe Hume and Hovell expedition camped by the river on 15 December 1824 and named it the \"Arndell\" after Hovell's father-in-law. John Helder Wedge 're-discovered' the river in 1835 and initially called it the \"Peel\", but then decided to call it the \"Ex\" or \"Exe\". The name of the town of Exford, an early crossing place on the river, is derived from this name. One of the local Wathaurong-speaking Kulin tribesman that accompanied Wedge said the name for the stream was 'Weariby Yallock' (\"yallock\" meaning 'stream'). The spelling changed to the present form of \"Werribee\", the original Aboriginal root word meaning \"spine\" or \"backbone\".\n\nWerribee River holds fish all along its course, most of which are at the mouth of the river into Port Phillip Bay in the estuary. This area is best fished for southern black bream.\n\nExploring the river offers an array of outdoor opportunities and is pastime for many local residents.

{"id": "2192212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192212", "title": "Kumbia Kings", "text": "Kumbia Kings\n\nLos Kumbia Kings were a Mexican-American cumbia group from Corpus Christi, Texas, created by Cruz Martínez & A.B. Quintanilla. Their music encompasses the styles of cumbia (hence their name), hip hop, and R&B. They produce songs in both Spanish and English. The band's producers from the beginning have been Quintanilla and Cruz Martínez. Quintanilla is the brother of the late \"Queen of Tejano\", Selena. Quintanilla played bass guitar for the group, while Martínez, husband of international artist Alicia Villarreal, played keyboards. Both co-wrote songs for the Kumbia Kings. Though the group has gone through a revolving door of members in recent years amid controversy and finger-pointing, and the Kumbia Kings of today are vastly different from what originated in Corpus Christi over eight years ago, Quintanilla and Martínez were always the soul of the group. Gone are original members Frankie J and DJ Kane, both of whom have gone on to significant success as solo artists, as well as the group K1 (Kingz One), a collaboration of founding members of Kumbia Kings who have defected from the group for reason of \"internal dissension\". Quintanilla, Irvin \"Pee Wee\" Salinas, as well as Selena's widower Chris Pérez, also decided to leave the group due to that same \"internal dissension\" and joined Los Kumbia All Starz, formed by A.B. Quintanilla. Martínez kept what was left of Los Kumbia Kings and formed his own group Los Super Reyes with the remaining members. In October 2009, Quintanilla and Martínez solved their differences, and announced that the Kumbia Kings would reunite for a series of concerts lasting from late 2009 through early 2010.\n\nLos Kumbia Kings 1999 debut album, \"Amor, Familia y Respeto\", immediately sold over 500,000 copies and earned them a Grammy nomination. 2001 brought the album \"Shhh!\", which in its first week, was number 2 among all Latin releases, and stayed at the top for almost 2 years. By 2003, the Kings had already earned a nomination for the \"Latin Artist of the Year\" at the American Music Awards, along with countless other musical awards and achievements. \"4\" was released in March 2003. It was a bilingual project that brought together innovative fusions of R&B, pop, reggae, hip hop, vallenatos, and electro-cumbia hits. Latin all-stars, such as Aleks Syntek, El Gran Silencio, Juan Gabriel, and the Grammy winning group Ozomatli brought extra dimension to the Kings' already encompassing style. In October 2004, Los Kumbia Kings released their fourth studio album titled \"Fuego\", another CD that, as well, has gone on to sell over 500,000 copies. This album had again saw the Kings meeting the \"Gold Standard\" in the music industry. On November 2, 2006, Los Kumbia Kings won their first Latin Grammy for their album, \"Kumbia Kings Live\" (Best Tropical Regional Mexican Album).\n\nUnfortunately, the Latin Grammy was a bittersweet victory for the group amidst the controversy and love/hate relationship between the co-producers of the band, A.B. Quintanilla and Cruz Martínez, as well as the other members and ex-members of the group. A.B. Quintanilla, the founder of Kumbia Kings, left the group and early in the summer of 2006 formed Los \"Kumbia All Starz\", a Kumbia Kings styled ensemble that released their first album \"Ayer Fue Kumbia Kings, Hoy Es Kumbia All Starz\" in early October of that year.\n\nA.B.'s new group has launched many hits such as \"Chiquilla\", \"Parece Que Va a Llover\" and \"Speedy Gonzales\". They are now touring all over Latin America and the United States. Cruz Martínez continued to tour with \"Los Kumbia Kings\" until he decided to change the name of the group he now headed to \"Los Super Reyes\". Many of the members of the Kumbia Kings opted to stay with Cruz and released their first album as Los Super Reyes, \"El Regreso de los Reyes\" in August 2007. Their first single, titled \"Muévelo\" has topped Latin radio airwaves in the United States as well as Latin America.\n\nA.B. Quintanilla successfully petitioned Mexican courts to claim the naming rights to \"Los Kumbia Kings\". Fellow Kumbia Kings founder Cruz Martínez never pursued counter litigation to retain or share the naming rights with Quintanilla. The name \"Los Kumbia Kings\" is retired according to Quintanilla, though rumors persist that \"Los Kumbia Kings\" will resurface at a later date with new band members. \"That name will make you money\", so it's foolish to think that it will not be used again, cites one record company executive.\n\nQuintanilla continues to tour with his group Los Kumbia All Starz, and their October 2006 release sold well. Plans for a follow-up album have not been discussed, as the group continues to heavily promote and tour their current release, but in the Latin music market where album releases by the biggest stars average about every 15 months, another release by the All Starz is expected early next year.\n\nCruz Martínez regrouped and took what was left of Los Kumbia Kings to Warner Music Latina. In late June it was announced that the new venture would be named \"Los Super Reyes\" with their first album \"El Regreso de los Reyes\" coming August 14, 2007. The single \"Muévelo\" was released to the public over the internet and radio. The Super Reyes ensemble includes cast-offs from the last edition of \"Los Kumbia Kings\". And in a surprising move, Martínez lured original Kumbia Kings members Alex and Roy Ramírez (who are also working with their own group Kingz One) to help him out with the project. \"They are original Kumbia Kings, so I thought it would be great to have them back, plus they're family,\" stated Martínez to Univision.\n\nLos Super Reyes after their huge success on the first debut album have continue to tour all Latin America and for the first time in Kumbia Kings history will be headed to Japan in October 2008 and Spain in November 2008 due to international hit \"Muévelo\" which has also certified the group for platinum and gold record sales between the United States and Mexico. The group is again expected to release another very anticipated studio album early 2009. In one interview, A.B. Quintanilla states that the \"Kumbia All Starz\" were the evolution of \"Kumbia Kings\" leaving out \"Los Super Reyes\" and \"Kingz One\".\n\nIt was recently announced by A.B. Quintanilla and Cruz Martínez themselves that the Kumbia Kings will reunite again. An exclusive interview was given on October 26, 2009, through Ventaneando America.\n\nAs of fall 2009, Kumbia All Starz and Super Reyes feature a combined 18 touring members. Members from both groups that seem to be rooted for the rebirth of Kumbia Kings (according to sources) are A.B. Quintanilla, Cruz Martínez, Jason \"DJ Kane\" Cano, Alex \"PB\" Ramírez, Roy \"Slim\" Ramírez, Anthony \"Nino B\" López, Abel Talamántez, Chris Pérez, DJ Crazy J Rodriguez, Juan Jesús \"JP\" Peña, and Ricky Rick.\n\nThe reunion concert was held at Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City, Mexico on November 21, 2009. The concert started with guest singer Flex who sang songs like \"Te Quiero\", \"Escápate\", \"Si No Te Tengo\" and \"Dime Si Te Vas Con Él\". Then Cruz Martínez & Los Super Reyes sang songs like \"Tu Magia\", \"No Tengo Dinero\", \"Muchacha Triste\", \"Sabes a Chocolate\", \"Na Na Na (Dulce Niña)\", \"Todavía\", \"Quédate Más (I Want You Back)\", \"Eres\" and \"Muévelo\". Then A.B. Quintanilla & Kumbia All Starz sang songs like \"Mami\", \"Reggae Kumbia\", \"Dijiste\", \"Por Ti Baby\" with Flex, performed a special tribute to Michael Jackson and Selena Quintanilla, and \"Parece Que Va a Llover\". For the grand finale A.B. Quintanilla and Cruz Martínez and the rest of the Kumbia Kings got on stage and sang songs like \"Pachuco\", \"Te Quiero a Ti\", \"Desde Que No Estás Aquí\", \"Fuiste Mala\", \"Dime Quién\", \"Se Fue Mi Amor\", \"Azúcar\", \"Boom Boom\" and \"Shhh!\".\n\nAccording to various sources a concert planned for early 2010 will feature A.B. Quintanilla's \"Kumbia All Starz\" and Cruz Martínez' \"Super Reyes\". With the show culminating with members from both groups reuniting and performing on stage for a \"Kumbia Kings\" reunion. Rumors persist that Martínez and Quintanilla will reunite early next year and begin production on a 2010 Kumbia Kings album, with original Kumbia Kings vocalist DJ Kane on lead vocals. \n\nThese are the former members who started their own groups, as listed in parentheses, but who were in the group at some point (as noted in years, before the split while the band was still called Kumbia Kings). They were the only official Kumbia Kings.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is also credited with writing the screenplay for the \"Romance Tropical\", the first Puerto Rican film with sound.\n\nPalés Matos was born in Guayama, Puerto Rico into a family of well-known poets which included both his parents, Vicente Palés Anés and Consuelo Matos Vicil and his brothers and sisters, Vicente, Gustavo, Consuelo and Josefa. His family was instrumental in his poetic development and is reflected when at the age of 17 he wrote and published his first book of poetry titled \"Azaleas\", a collection of his poems. In high school he became the editor of the school's monthly publication \"Mehr Licht\". His family's financial situation was bad and he was forced to drop out of high school and earn a living working in various jobs.\n\nIn 1918, he moved to the town of Fajardo where he worked for El Pueblo, the town's local newspaper. There he met a young lady by the name of Natividad Suliveres and soon married her. Natividad gave birth to a baby boy, but within a year his wife died of tuberculosis. Palés Matos was devastated and expressed his grief in the poem \"El palacio en sombras\" (The palace in shadows). He moved to San Juan and worked for the daily newspapers, El Mundo and El Imparcial. In San Juan he met and befriended José T. de Diego Padró, a fellow poet and together they created a literary movement known as \"Diepalismo\", a name derived from the combination of their surnames.\n\nIn 1926, a local newspaper \"La Democracia\" published \"Pueblo negro\" (Black village), the first known Afro-Antillano poem. This marked the start of a new genre in Latin American literature which blended words from the Afro-Caribbean culture into the Spanish verse of Puerto Rico. These poems were immediately and vitriolically criticized by white, mainstream Puerto Rican intellectuals who viewed black issues as not being noteworthy or appropriate topics for high literature.\n\nIn 1934, Palés Matos wrote the screenplay for \"Romance Tropical\", the first Puerto Rican movie with sound and the second Spanish movie with sound in the world. The movie, which was produced and directed by Juan Emilio Viguié, dealt with the romance between a poor boy and a rich girl. \"Romance Tropical\", which was distributed in theaters throughout Puerto Rico and New York by Pedro Juanera, was an astounding success. The film promised to give the Puerto Rican film industry international recognition, however the development of the industry was affected when a dispute over the copyrights between the Canino family (investors) and Viguié became public knowledge.\n\nIn 1937, Palés Matos published Tuntún de pasa y grifería (Drumbeats of Kinkiness and Blackness). This collection of poems received an award of recognition from the Puerto Rican Institute of Literature. Palés Matos gained fame with his literary work but, the experience was bittersweet. Though Palés Matos is considered, together with the Afro-Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén, the father of the \"Negrismo\" movement, he was also criticized by members of the black Puerto Rican community, who considered it an insult to their race that Palés Matos, a white (light-skinned) man, was becoming famous on their account. Nevertheless, black Puerto Rican performers such as Sylvia del Villard and Juan Boria recited Palés Matos's poetry.\n\nSome of Palés Matos' works are:\n\n\nIn 1957, his written work, \"Poesías\" was acclaimed by the Academy of the Spanish language. Palés Matos was selected by the faculty of the University of Puerto Rico as their conference representative. Palés Matos died of heart failure in San Juan on February 23, 1959.\n\n in Guayama is a residence museum dedicated to the memory of the poet.\n\nThere is a public school in Puerto Rico named after Palés Matos, in the town of Bayamón and a public housing complex in Guayama.\n\nThe school of Humanities of the University of Puerto Rico has a building named after him. \n\nThe Spanglish comic novel \"Yo-Yo Boing!\" by Nuyorican poet Giannina Braschi pays tribute to the Afro-Antillano poems of Luis Palés Matos who is the subject of debate among several characters in the novel.\n\nSinger/songwriter Roy Brown formed a group in the late 70s called Aires Bucaneros, which is the title of one of Palés Matos poems. The group released an eponymous album in 1979, featuring a song based on the poem. After that, Brown has written several songs based on Palés Matos poems.\n\n"}

It was designed, and is primarily used, as a regional airliner. It is also used as a freight aircraft and corporate transport, and by several governmental and military organisations. With customers favoring larger regional jets, Raytheon ended production in October 2002.\n\nThe aircraft was designed to carry passengers in all weather conditions from airports with relatively short runways. It is capable of flying in excess of , although few operators use its full-fuel range. In terms of the number of aircraft built and its continued use by many passenger airlines and other users, it is one of the most popular 19-passenger airliners in history.\n\nThe 1900 is Beechcraft's third regional airliner. The Beechcraft Model 18 was a 6- to 11-passenger utility aircraft produced from 1937 to 1970, used by the military, airlines, charter operations, corporations for executive transport, and freight carriers. The 15-passenger Beechcraft Model 99 Airliner was designed to replace the Beech 18, and was produced between 1966 and 1975, and from 1982 to 1986. It was also commercially successful and remains in common use with freight airlines such as Ameriflight.\n\nThe Beechcraft 1900's design lineage began in 1949 with the Beechcraft Model 50 Twin Bonanza, a 5-passenger, reciprocating engine utility aircraft designed for the U.S. Army. A larger passenger cabin was added to the Twin Bonanza's airframe, and called the Model 65 Queen Air. This aircraft was, in turn, further modified by adding turboprop engines and cabin pressurization, and named the Model 90 King Air. A stretched version of the King Air was later developed and designated the Model 200 Super King Air. Beechcraft developed the 1900 directly from the Super King Air, in order to provide a pressurized commuterliner to compete with the Swearingen Metro and the British Aerospace Jetstream.\n\nThe 1900 first flew on September 3, 1982, with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification awarded on November 22, 1983 under Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 41C airworthiness standards. Like the 1900, the 1900C was certified under SFAR 41C, but the later 1900D version was certified to FAR Part 23 \"Commuter Category\" standards.\n\nThe 1900 entered service in February 1984, with the first ExecLiner corporate version delivered in 1985. A total of 695 Beechcraft 1900 aircraft were built, making the airliner the best-selling 19-passenger airliner in history. With market trends favoring larger 50- to 90-seat regional jets, Raytheon ended production of the Beechcraft 1900 in October 2002. Many airlines continue to fly the 1900.\n\nSince the 1900 is derived from the King Air, all 1900s share certain characteristics with that aircraft. Cockpit controls and operations are similar to those of the King Air. While Federal Aviation Regulations require two pilots for passenger airline operations, the 1900 is designed and certificated for single-pilot operation in corporate or cargo settings, as is the King Air.\n\nThe 1900 is powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop engines. The 1900 and 1900C use two PT6A-65B engines, each flat rated at . The 1900D uses two PT6A-67D engines, each rated at .\n\nThe propellers are manufactured by Hartzell, with four blades on each propeller. The blades are made from composite materials.\n\nThe 1900D cruises at about 285 knots (328 mph or 528 km/h) true airspeed. Ordinary trip lengths range from 100 to 600 miles (20 minutes to two hours), but with full fuel tanks, the aircraft is capable of flying well in excess of .\n\nThe Beechcraft 1900 can operate safely on relatively short airstrips and it can take off and land on grass and rough runways.\n\nThe airplane is certified to fly up to an altitude of above mean sea level with its pressurized cabin. It is designed to operate in most weather conditions, including icing conditions, and it is usually equipped with weather radar to help pilots avoid severe weather. The aircraft can be fitted with a lavatory, using space otherwise available for passenger seating and cargo storage.\n\nThe original design is known simply as the Beechcraft 1900. It features two airstair passenger boarding doors: one near the tail of the aircraft much like the smaller King Airs, and a second at the front just behind the cockpit. It has a small cargo door near the tail for access to the baggage compartment, which is behind the passenger compartment. Only three airframes were built, with \"UA\" serial numbers of UA-1, UA-2, and UA-3. UA-1 and UA-2 are stored at a Beechcraft facility in Wichita, Kansas. UA-3, registered FAB-043, served in Bolivia until it crashed in November 2011.\n\nIt quickly became clear that having two airstair doors on an aircraft holding only 19 passengers was excessive. In creating the 1900C, Beechcraft kept the front airstair, but eliminated the aft airstair door, installing an enlarged cargo door in its place. Other than the redesigned door layout, the early 1900Cs were substantially similar to the original 1900s. These were assigned serial numbers starting with the letters UB. A total of 74 UB version were built, many of which remain in service.\nAircraft in the UA and UB series employ a bladder-type fuel tank system in the wings. Later 1900Cs use a wet wing fuel system: entire sections of the wing are sealed off for use as fuel tanks. This design change allowed more fuel to be stored, substantially increasing the 1900C's range. The wet wing 1900Cs were assigned serial numbers beginning with \"UC.\" These aircraft are also referred to as 1900C-1s. The wet wings proved popular, and the UC is the most common version of the low-ceiling 1900, with 174 UC airframes built.\n\nRaytheon manufactured six 1900C aircraft for use by the U.S. military. These were assigned \"UD\" serial numbers, UD-1 through UD-6.\n\nWhile the 1900C had become a popular regional airliner, Beechcraft undertook a substantial redesign of the aircraft, and in 1991 introduced a new version called the 1900D.\n\nThe 1900 and 1900C, like most 19-passenger airliners and small business jets, have fairly small passenger cabins, with ceilings so low that passengers (of typical male heights) cannot walk through the interior without bending forward. The 1900D was designed to remedy this by providing a \"stand-up cabin\", which would allow most passengers to walk upright. It is one of only two 19-seat airliners with this feature, the other being the British Aerospace Jetstream 31/32.\n\nBecause the taller passenger cabin adds both weight and drag to the airplane, other elements of the 1900D were also changed. More powerful engines and modified propellers were installed, winglets were added to reduce drag and increase the wings' efficiency, and the tail was made larger in response to the more powerful engines. The cockpit was updated with an Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS). The 1900D was certified under the then-new FAR Part 23 \"Commuter Category\" standards, which had replaced the earlier SFAR 41C. Since the UD serial numbers were already in use by the military 1900s, the 1900D airplanes have serial numbers beginning with UE. The 1900D is the most popular version of the airliner, with 439 of the 1900D built.\n\nA supplemental type certificate has been awarded to Alpine Air Express to convert 1900D into cargo aircraft. The STC involved adding a second emergency exit to the cockpit and converting the interior to a cargo configuration. The 1900D can carry 900 cubic feet of cargo, 30% more than a 1900C. Powered by PT6-67D, the super freighter has a max takeoff weight of 17,120lbs and is certified under the commuter category. Due to its standup cabin, the 1900D has a large internal volume. The large volume lends the aircraft well to the cargo industry where many packages are bulky and low in density. The 1900D is able to carry nearly as much volume as an EMB-120 and is certified for single pilot cargo operations. The single pilot crew and surplus of airframes allows for reduced operator costs.\n\nThe U.S. military designation for the Beechcraft 1900C is C-12J. This is a variant of the C-12 Huron, which is the most common designation for military King Airs. The C-12J includes the six Beechcraft 1900s with 'UD' serial number prefixes built for the U.S. military, as well as other 1900Cs in U.S. military service.\n\nExamples of C-12J aircraft in military service include one used for GPS jamming tests at the 586th Flight Test Squadron, Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, and three based at the 459th Airlift Squadron, Yokota Air Base, Japan. The U.S. Army operates both C-12J and 1900D aircraft along with other C-12 (King Air) aircraft.\n\nThe King Air ExecLiner was a marketing name for a corporate version of the Beechcraft 1900C.\n\nIn July 2018, a total of 114 1900Cs and 192 1900Ds were in airline service: 207 in the Americas, 63 in Africa, 25 in Europe and 11 in the Asia Pacific and Middle East.

Scott Fitzgerald's novel \"The Great Gatsby\",\n\n\n\nThe prototypes for the songs on the band's first record, Why We Fight, were (according to Bobby) written by his earlier band, One Point Two on Together Records (Killed For Less Records) out of Richmond Indiana. Scott George owner of Together Records/Killed For Less Records says One Point Two CD is still available on interpunk.com and to this date claims it to be ahead of its time and ground breaking. This band was made up of Bobby, Casey Bates, Josh Berg, and Dustin McGhie. The group later met up with the former guitarist and singer of Good for Nothing, Nic Newsham and Ryan Van Wieringen, and formed Gatsbys American Dream. Although Casey Bates never joined the band, he has remained their producer throughout the band's career.\n\nWhen Acceptance guitarist Kaylan Cloyd heard a Gatsbys demo, he handed it to Darrick Bourgeois, owner of local record label Rocketstar Recordings. Shortly afterward, Gatsbys signed a two-record deal with Rocketstar and worked with producer Aaron Sprinkle to record their 2002 debut album \"Why We Fight\". Their first show after being signed drew in a crowd in excess of 500, which was largely due to Rocketstar's extensive promotion.\n\nShortly after the release of their first album, the line-up changed when bassist Josh Berg left and Kirk Huffman (formerly of K Through Six) was recruited. He is often recognized as the only bassist because Berg never toured with the band. After the band's first tour, Dustin McGhie also left and the band found Rudy Gahadjar, formerly of Waxwing and Bugs in Amber. .\n\nIn 2003, the band released their second record, \"Ribbons and Sugar\", a concept album based loosely on George Orwell’s fable \"Animal Farm\". Musically, the album found them exploring a harder-edged pop sound, opting for unusual time signatures and tempo changes. Although literary references are common through most of their material, \"Ribbons and Sugar\" also began a motif of record label disdain. The lyrics of \"Cut the Strings\" read:\n\"This is awful to think who decides what should or should not stay, what ends up on the cutting room floor. Apparently it's not my choice to make.\"\n\nGatsbys' two-record deal with Rocketstar was fulfilled with \"Ribbons and Sugar\", and the band decided not to renew their contract. Later, guitarist Ryan Van Wieringen would leave the band to further his college education.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Ribbons and Sugar\", the band did a showcase with Drive Thru Records. Slightly embittered by the process, the band signed a one-record deal with Chicago-based LLR Recordings in 2004. Their contractual record, the more mellow and subdued \"In the Land of Lost Monsters\" EP, was in part a response to the post-\"Ribbons\" record label attention the band had received. Labels that approached them wanted the band to write choruses for their next record (a standard songwriting technique the band had, up to that point, seemed to avoid). Newsham and Darling's lyrics for \"Lost Monsters\" reflected this struggle, criticizing the music industry and expressing the band's wariness of record labels, although this was not the only theme of the album. In addition, many of the literary illusions on this EP centered on A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin as seen by the songs \"The Dragon of Pendor\" and \"The Loosing of the Shadow\", although Darling has denied that the lyrics of \"The Dragon of Pendor\" were about the Le Guin book in particular.\n\nSeveral months after the EP's release, the band settled on Fearless Records and released their third full-length, \"Volcano\", in April 2005. Thematically, \"Volcano\" revolves around Pompeii (as evidenced by the title of the second track on the record), which stands as a metaphor for the uncontrollable intensity of human emotion. The album is rife with literary and cultural references from such diverse works as children's film \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\", Lionhead Studio's \"Fable\", William Golding's \"Lord of the Flies\", Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\", the action film \"Jurassic Park\", and Orson Scott Card's science-fiction epics \"Ender's Game\" and \"Speaker for the Dead.\"\n\nDuring the tour that followed the release of \"Volcano\", Gatsbys added Kyle O'Quin (also a member of the band Surrounded By Lions). A few months after O'Quin was added to the band, Ryan Van Wieringen met up with the band in Arizona while they were on tour there and rejoined the line up. Since then, he has been touring and performing live as part of the band.\n\nGatsbys' self-titled fourth full-length album was released August 8, 2006. The album is peppered with numerous pop culture and literary references, which appear in both the lyrics and song titles, ranging from works by Philip K. Dick to the television show \"Lost\".\n\nThe band has been relatively inactive since the release of the self-titled album. The band has played a handful of shows in and around the Seattle area, and on April 27, 2007, they played their first out-of-state show since the self-titled album's release at Colgate University. In a forum post at Gatsbys fansite Snicker at the Swine, Bobby stated the following in regards to future albums or tours:\n\nDuring the hiatus, most of the members started side projects.\n\nIn September 2010, at Forgive Durden's \"Return to Wonderland\" show at El Corazon in Seattle, which included Places and Numbers (Bobby Darling with all members except Newsham as a backing band), and Princess Dinosaur (Nic Newsham). The show concluded with all of the members of Gatsbys American Dream going on stage after Places and Numbers and playing \"Theatre\" off of \"Volcano\".\n\nOn October 5, 2010, entirely through newly created Facebook/Twitter accounts, the band announced they were officially reuniting. They also hinted towards the album they began recording by uploading pictures and mentioning Casey Bates' studio. The band also asked fans to contact their booking agent and request cities for a future tour. Gatsby noted that side projects Kay Kay and His Weathered Underground and Wild Orchid Children in particular would not be affected by the reunion.\n\nIn January 2011 the band worked with the Overdue Collection Agency, a record label dedicated to remastering vinyl records and sending the profits to a charity of the band's choice. They re-released their first two albums, Why We Fight and Ribbons & Sugar on vinyl, with the label, with the goal of raising $5,500 for water.org. They exceeded their goal well before the due date and planned to release their first EP, \"In the Land of Lost Monsters\", later.\n\nOn March 4, 2011, the band unveiled new material, with a song titled \"Modern Man\" on their new official website. In order to hear it, fans have to play a game similar to Angry Birds. On March 11, a second song, initially named \"Born Dead\", was to be streamed, but it was delayed and renamed \"Untitled\" after the 2011 Yunnan earthquake. The song was released a few days after the event, under the name \"Untitled\". From this point the band went inactive, with no official statements or releases for over two years. On March 12, 2013, Nic Newsham announced via Twitter that the planned reunion album was still incomplete, and that it would probably never be released.\n\n\n\n\n\"A Year in the Gulch\" was released in 2003.\nIt contains footage by Casey Bates, Eric Slagle, and the band.\nIt was produced, edited, and designed by Casey Bates.\nThe video contains three music videos including the Ribbons and Sugar CD release party, touring and recording featurettes, over 150 photos, personal member videos, behind the scenes footage of a year with the band when they were recording and touring in support of Ribbons and Sugar.\n\nThe following bands were started during Gatsbys's unofficial hiatus. Of all the Gatsbys members, Rudy Gajadhar is the only one with no other known projects, though he played drums with Search/Rescue at a June 2007 show in Seattle and recorded drums for Forgive Durden's album, \"Razia's Shadow\".\n\nKay Kay and His Weathered Underground is an indie band started by Kirk Huffman and Kyle O'Quin. Like Gatsbys, the band is influenced by a wide variety of musical genres. Though the band only has three official members, they have been known to perform with as many as 11 additional musicians on stage.\n\nSearch/Rescue is a progressive rock band formed by members of Gatsbys American Dream and Acceptance. The band independently released their debut album, titled \"The Compound\", in 2008.\n\nRedRedBlue was Newsham's powerpop side project with Justin Harcus of Pale Pacific. The band's name was taken from a Gatsbys song from \"In the Land of Lost Monsters\", which was often thought to be a reference to an army's color code from the book \"Ender's Game\" by Orson Scott Card (Newsham has said this was just a coincidence). To date, the band has released 3 tracks for download on their MySpace page. On August 23, Newsham posted a MySpace bulletin stating that due to popular request, he would start writing more songs for RedRedBlue, but that they would likely be acoustic-only.\n\n\nWild Orchid Children is another band featuring Huffman and O'Quin. In August 2007, the band started a MySpace page and posted a single song, titled \"Ahead of Us the Secret\" which was also made available for free download at Gatsbys fansite Snicker At The Swine. The band features musicians from other prominent Seattle bands The Divorce and Forgive Durden.\n\nThe band started taking pre-orders in late October 2007 for a 4-song EP, which includes the songs released for streaming on the band's Myspace page. After a manufacturing error caused delays in the release of the EP, the band started shipping orders in January 2008. The EP's artwork is by John Gourley.\n\nWild Orchid Children signed to Equal Vision Records in the summer of 2010, \"The Wild Orchid Children Are Alexander Supertramp\" was subsequently released on Tuesday, November 9, 2010. The album features all four tracks from the previous EP, re-recorded with extended sections and additional instrumentation.\n\n\nBombs Over Bellevue is an independent label started by Huffman.\n\nTo date, the label's only release is the live Kay Kay and His Weathered Underground DVD/CD \"Live at the Pretty Parlor\". The label's website stated that a 5-song EP by Seattle band Man in the Blue Van will be released toward the end of the year as well as a 10\" vinyl-only release from Huffman's Wild Orchid Children.\n\nKeith Ledger is a punk band featuring Nic Newsham on vocals. So far, the band has released four tracks for streaming on their Myspace page and played a handful of shows in the Seattle area.\n\n\nZero Cool is a rock band featuring Bobby Darling and Thomas Dutton of Forgive Durden. The band came out of an idea both members had about mapping out an entire album using guidelines for the tempo and key and setting up the session in ProTools before playing a single note. Currently, the band has only released a single song titled \"Godzilla\" on Forgive Durden's blog.\n\n\nForgive Durden's \"Razia's Shadow\" is a musical involving several artists in the Seattle indie scene. The album features Nic as King Malka in the song \"Meet the King\", and Rudy playing the drums throughout the album.\n\nPrincess Dinosaur is a side project started by Nick Vombrack (formerly of Dr Manhattan) with help from Nic Newsham. They currently have three songs on their Myspace page. They released a six-song EP titled \"A Goldfish and his Friends\" for one \"Like\" on Facebook\n\nBand Members:\n\nBobby Darling has recorded new material under the moniker Places and Numbers with the help of friend/producer Casey Bates, using an iBook and a Macbook Pro while they traveled around Europe. Places and Numbers signed to Equal Vision Records in early 2010 and released their debut EP, \"Waking The Dead\", on a pay what you can model through Bandcamp.com. A full-length album titled \"Travels\" is expected later in 2010.\n\nTicktockman is an alternative band featuring Andy Lum and Ryan Van Wieringen. They released their first EP, \"Periscope\", for sale on iTunes on February 3, 2010. It is also up for download on the pay what you can website Bandcamp.com.\n\nThe band released their first full-length record \"Ticktockman\" on February 14, 2012. It features 11 original tracks recorded with producer Derek Moree.\n\nAn as yet untitled second EP is expected from the band some time in 2012.\n\nMembers\n\n\nKeyboard player Kyle O'Quin announced on March 11 via snickerattheswine.com that he had recorded a solo album and would be touring with the Seattle-based band Lets Get Lost serving as a backing band.\n\n(July 10, 2015) Seattle-based indie rock vets Bobby Darling and Nic Newsham (formerly of Gatsby’s American Dream) have recently revealed their new post-punk collaboration, The Money Pit, and are set to release their self-titled debut on September 4. Produced by Casey Bates (Portugal. The Man, Pierce the Veil), the record evokes the garage rock sound of early The Strokes and Arctic Monkeys, while retaining signature elements that Gatsby’s longtime fans will recognize.\n\n"}

Together, Lloyd and Lucas were affectionately dubbed the \"twin towers\" due to their height in the Bomber forward line.\n\nLucas is known for his strong marking and being a powerful, accurate left foot kick, although his apparent inability to kick with his right foot is almost as notable. Lucas once joked on \"The Sunday Footy Show\" in 2006 that the last time he kicked with his right foot was to Gary Moorcroft when he took the 2001 Mark of the Year.\n\nHe mainly played across half-forward or centre half-forward, but also played at centre half-back and full forward. Lucas regularly had shots on goal from outside 60-metres with his booming left foot and rarely handballed, averaging less than 3 handballs a match.\n\nIn round 19, 2005, Lucas played his 200th AFL game and kicked his 300th AFL goal against at Telstra Dome, but the milestones would be remembered for all the wrong reasons, as the Bombers lost by 20 points despite leading at every change.\n\nIn 2006, Lucas had an outstanding year in an underachieving Essendon side, playing at full forward and being their main target and goal kicker in the absence of captain Matthew Lloyd. Lucas finished the season with a career best 67 goals, runner-up in the Coleman Medal behind Brendan Fevola, and polled a joint team-high seven votes from just 36 votes received by Essendon players in the 2006 Brownlow Medal. Lucas was one of just three players who played every match for season 2006. He capped off this season with his second Crichton Medal, winning with 239 votes from Jobe Watson's 221. Lucas had previously won the club trophy in 2003, when the honours were shared with club great James Hird.\n\nAgainst West Coast in Round 11, 2007, Lucas booted his 400th career goal.\n\nA vintage display also came against West Coast in Round 22, when, despite being close to 50 points down, Lucas rallied in the last quarter in a remarkable solo effort, booting 7 goals (and just missing for a record-equaling eighth), reducing the margin to just 2 points. In the end a late goal to the Eagles saw a gallant Essendon fall 8 points short of one of the greatest ever AFL comebacks. This was also the last game of Essendon legend James Hird and coach of 27 years, Kevin Sheedy.\n\nDuring a match against the Western Bulldogs in the 2008 NAB Cup, Lucas managed to kick a record 3 Super Goals which took his career tally to 7, making him the leading super goal kicker in the AFL.\n\nLucas suffered a knee injury, a torn cartilage in the first round of the 2008 season against North Melbourne and was out of action for a number of weeks. Along with teammate Dustin Fletcher, Lucas signed a one-year contract mid-2008. He bounced back to play in the second half of the season and kicked an amazing mid air soccer goal against Richmond late in the season.\n\nOn 18 August 2009, Lucas announced his immediate retirement from football.\n\nIn 2013, Lucas was inducted into the Essendon Football Club Hall of Fame.\n\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1996\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1997\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1998\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1999\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2000\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2001\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2002\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2003\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2004\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2005\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2006\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2007\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2008\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2009\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 270\n! 471\n! 309\n! 3201\n! 835\n! 4036\n! 1550\n! 470\n! 1.7\n! 1.1\n! 11.9\n! 3.1\n! 14.9\n! 5.7\n! 1.7\n\nOn 4 January 2002 he married Georgina Short.

KMZQ went through many changes over its 12-year run. KMZQ was known as \"Q-100\" and \"Klassy 100.\" From 1995 to 2005, it was known as \"Lite 100.5 FM.\" \n\nOn June 24, 2005, at 2 PM, after playing \"Leaving Las Vegas\" by Sheryl Crow, KMZQ began stunting with Christmas music; 45 minutes later, the stunt shifted to movie theme songs with the sound of a Roulette wheel in between. At 3 PM, the stunt ended with voiceover artist Howard Cogan asking to \"please cut the cheesy Roulette wheel sound effect\". Shortly thereafter, Lite 100.5 became Jack FM, with a variety hits format.

It has a population of 80,114.\nThe Shire of East Gippsland, also called Far East Gippsland, covers two-thirds (66%) of East Gippsland's area and holds half (50%) of its population.\nThe Shire of East Gippsland is confusingly also referred to simply as East Gippsland. It excludes the Shire of Wellington (Central Gippsland). This article (currently) refers mainly to \"Far East Gippsland\".\n\nEast Gippsland's major towns include, from west to east, Bairnsdale (the largest town and administrative centre), Paynesville, Lakes Entrance, Orbost and Mallacoota. Smaller, but significant, towns in the more mountainous northern areas include Ensay, Swifts Creek, Omeo, and Buchan. \n\nEast Gippsland extends from the western watershed of the Mitchell and Thomson River catchments east and north to the New South Wales border. Rugged terrain makes farming difficult, even with fertilisers. \n\nThe major industry is often considered to be forestry, which provides less than 1 percent of employment for the region. The East Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) was signed by Commonwealth and Victorian governments on 3 February 1997, and is Australia's first RFA. It covers a region similar, but not identical to the East Gippsland Shire. It sets aside 5,811 km² from logging, an increase of 1.3% over pre-RFA reserves. Central Gippsland is covered by the Gippsland RFA (signed 31 March 2000), which covers an area similar to the Shire of Wellington, and places 7,805 km² in reserves.\n\nLogging of native forests has caused sustained controversy in East Gippsland, particularly due to the unique species found in areas east of the Snowy River, and the contentious public debate surrounding native forest, particularly old-growth, harvesting. This is despite managed forest having a mitigation effect in climate change.\n\nThe major river basins of the Mitchell, Tambo and Nicholson drain into the Gippsland Lakes, which in turn empty into the sea through an artificially maintained opening at Lakes Entrance. \n\nThe area is a major tourist destination, especially for watersports, and is noted for its mild climate. The Great Alpine Road leads north from Bairnsdale into the Australian Alps via Swifts Creek and Omeo, and onto the major ski resorts of Dinner Plain and Mount Hotham. This area is also very popular for bushwalking in the summer. The Buchan district is popular with tourists for its limestone caves. Further east, the Snowy River and several smaller stream catchments, including the Thurra, Wingan, Genoa, Bemm River and Cann River, enter the Tasman Sea.\n\nMore than 17,000 km² of East Gippsland is public land with 2,680 km² being national parks, two of the largest being Snowy River National Park and Errinundra National Park. Both are remote and inaccessible, but they are otherwise entirely different. Snowy River National Park features dramatic gorges and powerful rapids formed by the descent of the Snowy River. Apart from gorges and southern slopes, this park is in a rain-shadow area forming the southern border of the Monaro Tableland. Consequently, many species more typical of inland New South Wales and Victoria are found here. Errinundra National Park is much wetter - inaccessible from June to October in most years - and features some of the most ancient forests in Australia, a matter of controversy as employment in the remote areas east of the Snowy is mainly dependent upon timber milling. Croajingolong National Park between Marlo and Mallacoota features extensive coastal heathlands and tea tree scrub, as well as the only major area of warm temperate rainforest in Victoria. The 4,193 km² of privately owned land is mainly red gum plains, coastal plains, mountain plateaux and fertile river valleys.\n\nOfficial East Gippsland tourism website\n"}

The band released three albums before splitting up in 1996.\n\nThe band started as the duo of Kelly Riles and guitarist/singer Archie Moore (also of Black Tambourine) in 1989 (the two having met at university), initially going under the name The Gotterdemocrats. They became Velocity Girl with the addition of Brian Nelson (ex-Big Jesus Trashcan, also of Black Tambourine), Jim Spellman (ex-High Back Chairs), and lead singer Bridget Cross (soon to join Unrest). The band took its name from a Primal Scream B-side which appeared on the \"C86\" compilation album. Sarah Shannon joined to replace Cross after the release of the band's debut single \"I Don't Care If You Go.\" While most 1990s rock music featured an abrasive vocal and instrumental style, Velocity Girl's sound, especially post-1993, was more melodic and typically featured \"clean\" (non-distorted) electric guitar sounds and two-part harmonies. The band described their influences as \"the Rough Trade and Postcard labels and some of the early Creation bands.\" However, on their first seven-inch records on Slumberland and Merge, as well as their first Sub Pop album, \"Copacetic\", Velocity Girl were noted for their shoegaze influences. The band was noted for its love of releasing a steady stream of 7\" vinyl singles. Slumberland Records was formed in 1989 by members of several D.C.-area bands, including Velocity Girl. They often featured female/male vocals, sometimes simultaneously, while Archie Moore providing the male vocals.\n\nVelocity Girl toured frequently, releasing three full-length recordings on the Sub Pop label. Music videos were released for \"Crazy Town,\" (1993),\"Audrey's Eyes,\" (directed by Phil Harder) (1993) \"Sorry Again,\" (1994) \"I Can't Stop Smiling,\" (directed by Spike Jonze) (1994) and \"Nothing\" (1996). The group disbanded in late 1996 after playing their last show \"The Buzz Bakesale\" in West Palm Beach, Florida. Coincidentally, this was the same time that the career of Lush, the band to which Velocity Girl were most frequently compared, ended as well. Shannon, Riles and Spellman reunited in a short-lived project called Starry Eyes, releasing one EP in 1998. Moore had already formed Heartworms before Velocity Girl split up, and later formed The Saturday People with Terry Banks of Tree Fort Angst.\n\nSarah Shannon went on to release her self-titled album in 2002. There was one Velocity Girl reunion show played at the Black Cat in Washington, DC on June 9, 2002.\n\nJim Spellman, now a noted CNN reporter, played guitar in now-defunct Washington, D.C. based power-pop band Julie Ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

LDIF conveys directory content as a set of records, one record for each object (or entry). It also represents update requests, such as Add, Modify, Delete, and Rename, as a set of records, one record for each update request.\n\nLDIF was designed in the early 1990s by Tim Howes, Mark C. Smith, and Gordon Good while at the University of Michigan. LDIF was updated and extended in the late 1990s for use with Version 3 of LDAP. This later version of LDIF is called version 1 and is formally specified in RFC 2849, an IETF Standard Track RFC. RFC 2849 is authored by Gordon Good and was published in June 2000. It is currently a Proposed Standard.\n\nA number of extensions to LDIF have been proposed over the years. One extension has been formally specified by the IETF and published. RFC 4525, authored by Kurt Zeilenga, extended LDIF to support the LDAP Modify-Increment extension. It is expected that additional extensions will be published by the IETF in the future.\n\nEach content record is represented as a group of attributes, with records separated from one another by blank lines. The individual attributes of a record are represented as single logical lines (represented as one or more multiple physical lines via a line-folding mechanism), comprising \"name: value\" pairs. Value data that do not fit within a portable subset of ASCII characters are marked with '::' after the attribute name and encoded into ASCII using base64 encoding. The content record format is a subset of the Internet Directory Information type.RFC 2425\n\nThe OpenLDAP utilities include tools for exporting data from LDAP servers to LDIF content records (ldapsearch), importing data from LDIF content records to LDAP servers (ldapadd), and applying LDIF change records to LDAP servers (ldapmodify).\n\nLDIF is one of the formats for importing and exporting address book data that the address books in Netscape Communicator and in the Mozilla Application Suite support.\n\nMicrosoft Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003 include an LDIF based command line tool named LDIFDE for importing and exporting information in Active Directory.\n\nJXplorer is a cross platform open source java application that can browse and do basic editing of LDIF files.\n\n\nThis is an example of a simple directory entry with several attributes, represented as a record in LDIF:\n\nThis is an example of an LDIF record that modifies multiple single-valued attributes for two different directory entries (this format is used by Microsoft's LDIFDE tool):\n\nNote: the \"-\" character between each attribute change is required.

A second game with no related storyline, \"\", produced by Cavia for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox game consoles, was released on April 25, 2006.\n\nThe story follows one Jean-Luc Cougar, a secret agent infiltrating a laser satellite's command center. Gameplay revolves around its innovative cover system, in which the player takes cover behind corners and then ducks out to shoot. The player cannot move while shooting; instead, the control stick is used to aim, a task made easier by the fact that every weapon is equipped with a laser sight.\n\n\"WinBack\"'s cover system eventually went on to influence several later shooters, including \"\" (2001) and \"Kill Switch\" (2003), which in turn influenced games like \"Gears of War\" (2006). The cover system has since become a staple of third-person shooters. \"WinBack\" also featured a laser-sight mechanic that was later incorporated in action games such as \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" and \"Resident Evil 4\" (2005), and in turn would also become a staple of third-person shooters.\n\nA terrorist group called \"Crying Lions\" takes control of a space-based laser weapon. This is used to attack a military installation housing the controls to the weapon, called the GULF system. The leader of the terrorists calls himself Colonel Kenneth Coleman. The Secretary of Defense contacts the Special Covert Action Team (SCAT) with their orders: Enter the GULF complex and reclaim it. Jean-Luc Cougar is part of the team, and the last to escape the helicopter being shot down. The player takes control of Jean-Luc as he leaps a wall and enters a parking lot. The team is scattered throughout the complex and you must find them and destroy the satellite control center before the GULF satellite laser can recharge and fire again. Along the way you will face a number of laser traps, puzzles, machine gun nests, ambushes and mazes. You will face a series of bosses culminating in the final boss fight (against Kenneth Coleman's deputy Cecile).\n\nThere are two possible endings, depending on how long it takes the player (as Jean-Luc) to reach the control room.\n\n\nAfter killing Jin, one of the Crying Lions bosses, in the generator room, a confrontation emerges between the remaining active S.C.A.T. team members (Jake, Jean-Luc, and Lisa) and the remaining Crying Lions' bosses other than Kenneth Coleman (Cecile and Deathmask). A shootout erupts during which Jake is killed while Lisa is knocked unconscious and taken hostage by Cecile, who subsequently departs. Jean-Luc and Deathmask fight in one-on-one combat, with Jean-Luc emerging the victor and killing Deathmask, before Jean-Luc gives chase to Cecile.\n\nCecile, realizing that the Crying Lions objective is likely to fail with the S.C.A.T. team having penetrated so far into the facility, betrays and kills Kenneth Coleman, so as to take control of the terrorist group and the weaponized satellite to achieve his own ulterior motives: blackmailing the US government into giving him a large sum of money. However, S.C.A.T. team leader Dan arrives at the control room and seemingly kills Cecile. Lisa regains consciousness, and is surprised to discover that Dan is working with the Crying Lions, but is again disabled by Dan after he gives her details of how to destroy the satellite.\n\nUpon reaching the satellite control room, Jean-Luc encounters Dan, who reveals he is a traitor, the killer of both Steve and Thomas, and forces Jean-Luc into a confrontation. After a fierce battle, Dan is mortally wounded and tells Jean-luc his reasons for his betrayal of the team: he is half-Saroczian. The war split his family in two, his mother and sister defected to Russia with him in tow, whilst his brother and father joined the Saroczian Revolution. Several years later after the separation, he joined the Army and was eventually sent on a mission by the US Forces to keep the government in power by quashing the revolution supported by a majority of the people. The mission was carried out but Dan was filled with regrets which he says fate was responsible for. He also met his brother, Kenneth Coleman, leader of the Crying Lions who fought to end the suffering of the Saroczian people and avenge his father's death. Dan subsequently dies of his wounds, and Cecile, who survived being shot by Dan earlier, appears and fights one last battle against Jean-Luc in which he is ultimately killed. Once the confrontation is over, Lisa arrives to discover that both Cecile and Dan are dead. Jean-luc Convinces Lisa to destroy the GULF satellite, believing it is too powerful for any one country to control. The GULF satellite is destroyed as Jean-Luc, Keith, and Lisa escape, with Operation Winback ending in success.\n\n\nJean-Luc finds both Lisa and Jake dead in the generator room, both presumably killed by Jin, the elusive (bad ending) Crying Lions boss whom Jean-Luc faces and kills in the generator room should he arrive fast enough (the good ending). Upon reaching the satellite control room, Jean-Luc finds Cecile waiting for him. Cecile tells Jean-Luc that he was too late, the satellite has already fired twice, destroying the Pentagon and White house. Jean-Luc confronts and kills Cecile and goes to the communications room to find Kenneth Coleman, pleased that his \"objective\" and \"cause\" was a success. After some talk, Kenneth shoots himself. Jean-Luc and Keith are the only survivors of Operation Winback, which is ultimately a failure.\n\nThe game featured a standard multiplayer mode and a Bot mode in the PlayStation 2 version of the game and only in the NTSC versions of the game, where players had access to all of the game's abilities and weapons. At the beginning of the game, all the members of Jean-Luc's team are available as selectable characters, all of them come with a basic hand gun as their initial weapon, except for Dan who comes with a unique gun as his main weapon. As the player finished the game or used the cheat code, they will unlock all the bosses and other characters that they had defeated or appeared in story mode. Each boss has a unique weapon that they used in the story mode with infinite ammo.\n\nThe game is a third person shooter. Lock ons are required to shoot enemies. There is also a cover system in the game to help avoid taking damage.\n\n\"Gamers' Republic\" noted that \"Winback\", along with \"Dynasty Warriors and Enigma\", was an attempt for Koei to branch out from strategy games that they were known for. A gameplay demo of the game was presented at the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo and later at the 1999 Nintendo Spaceworld trade show.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Said console version did slightly better than the N64 version, with its improved controls and graphics, but the voice-acting was criticized. Chris Kramer of \"Next Generation\" said of the latter console version, \"The action is simple and the environments are not very detailed, but \"Winback\" [\"sic\"] is fun in an arcade-like fashion.\" Jim Preston later called the former console version \"a game with awkward controls and stiff action set in a boring world of boxes and bad guys. Skip it.\" In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave both console versions each a score of 30 out of 40.\n\n"}

It is situated near the village of Abbotsbury in Dorset, England, west of Weymouth on a site around the Fleet Lagoon protected from the weather of Lyme Bay by Chesil Beach. The colony can number over 600 swans with around 150 pairs. Written records of the swannery's existence go back to 1393 but it probably existed well before that, and is believed to have been set up by Benedictine monks in the eleventh century.\n\nThe Fleet lagoon formed at the end of the last ice age as melt water flooded behind the already formed Chesil Beach leaving shallow salty water in which plants grew profusely producing an ideal environment for wildfowl and water birds. The Benedictine monastery of St. Peter's was established on the site in the eleventh century when King Cnut gave the land to his steward, Orc, and the monks managed the swans as a ready source of meat for use at their lavish banquets.\n\nThe swannery was used by the monks until 1539 when the monastery was dissolved by King Henry VIII. The ruined remains of the monastery are still visible near the Church of St. Nicholas, Abbotsbury. The site was then purchased by Sir Guy Strangeways, and has remained in the ownership of the Strangeways family through fifteen generations up to the present day; an estate of some in Dorset covering Chesil Beach and Abbotsbury is still held by the Ilchester Estate owned by Mrs Charlotte Townshend, the daughter of the 9th Viscount Galway, a descendant of the first Countess of Ilchester.\n\nThe Fleet, besides which the swannery sits, is the largest lagoon in Europe, and runs for about along the Dorset coast. It is brackish and tidal, but sheltered by Chesil Beach, and is a RAMSAR site of international importance and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and has been a nature reserve since as early as 1393. The swannery is at its westerly extremity.\n\nAbbotsbury Swannery is today a tourist attraction and the swans have become accustomed to the presence of visitors and allow close but respectful approach even in the nesting season when cygnets are on the nest. Before viewing the swans, visitors can look at the Decoyman's House which sets the scene for the visit with a display explaining how the colony has been managed over the years and how the present situation has evolved. Apart from the swans, the Fleet and Chesil Beach attracts many species of waterfowl and over 300 different varieties have been recorded leading to the area being designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a Special Protected Area (SPA) and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC).\n\nNesting mute swans are usually intensely territorial, so it is unusual to see this many pairs in proximity to each other. However, the closeness of the nests can sometimes lead to problems as newly hatched cygnets can become attached to the wrong parent bird; to overcome this, rearing pens are used for a few selected families who need more privacy. The daily feeding sessions take place at noon and 4 p.m. A large mass of the birds gather round; children are invited to help with the feeding.\n\nAt the end of July, the swans become flightless, for around six weeks, due to the moulting of their feathers. Once every two years, the swans are rounded up, so that they can be examined, weighed and measured and any new birds to the colony ringed. The round-up is undertaken by around 50 canoes that start at the eastern end of the lagoon and slowly drive the birds into the swannery bay at Abbotsbury. In the past the round-up has resulted in over 900 birds being caught and recorded, but it varies from year to year.\n\nToday, there are around 600 swans. They are free-flying birds and could choose to nest anywhere, but are obviously attracted by the Fleet Lagoon. Visitors can wander on small paths among the various nests, sometimes experiencing the birds' territorial displays. The swannery is open to the public between March and the end of October, and an interesting time to visit is between the middle of May and the end of June when young cygnets are present. Twice a day at noon and 4pm, mass feeding of the swans takes place.\n\nAbbotsbury Swannery features on the cover of the Canadian new wave band, Martha and the Muffins 1980 hit \"Echo Beach\".\n\nIt was also a filming location for \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\"; the actual location seems to have been a reed bed, but it is unclear exactly where at the swannery the filming occurred.\n\n\n"}

The units numbered 121,968 men and fielded 752 guns and 743 tanks on 17 September.\n\nThe 3rd Army saw its first action in September 1939, taking part in the operation in Belarus and Poland. The invasion was conducted under the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which divided Poland between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany and guaranteed that neither country would attack the other.\n\nOrder of Battle on 2 October 1939:\n\n\nAfter the start of Operation Barbarossa, it included three corps, including the 4th Rifle Corps (27th, 56th, and 85th Rifle Divisions), as well as the 21st Rifle Corps (17th, 24th, 37th and 50th Rifle Divisions) and 11th Mechanised Corps (29th and 33rd Tank Division and 204th Motorised Division).\n\nThe 3rd Army took part in the operations of the Western, Central, Bryansk during the defenses of Grodno, Lida, and Novogrudok.\n\nThe 3rd Army also took part in the Battle of Smolensk, where German troops captured the city in a difficult two-month campaign, and the Battle of Moscow, in which the Red Army's winter counter-attack led by Marshal Georgy Zhukov drove back Army Group Center over away from Moscow. During the second half of the Eastern Front, the 3rd Army took part in the Battle of Kursk, where numerically superior Soviet forces, using anti-tank defenses, defeated the German forces, thus stopping Operation Zitadelle and robbing the German Army of all hopes of victory on the Eastern Front. The 3rd Army took part in the Bryansk, Gomel–Rechitsa, and Rogachev-Zhlobin Offensives. During the final phases of the war, the 3rd Army took part in Operation Bagration, the East Prussian Offensive, and the advance into eastern Germany, where it participated in the Battle of Berlin.\n\nOn 1 May 1945 the 3rd Army consisted of the 35th Rifle Corps (250th, 290th, and 348th Rifle Divisions), 40th Rifle Corps (5th, 129th, and 169th Rifle Divisions), 41st Rifle Corps (120th Guards, 269th, and 283rd Rifle Divisions), 4th Corps Artillery Brigade, 44th Gun Artillery Brigade, 584th Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment, and other formations and units.\n\nThe Army headquarters was withdrawn to the Belarussian SSR, where it was reorganised in August 1945 as the short-lived Headquarters Belorussian-Lithuanian Military District. The Belorussian-Lithuanian Military District, according to a Czech internet source (valka), existed 31 Dec 44 – 9 July 1945, whereupon it was succeeded by the Minsk Military District. By this time the army consisted of three Rifle Corps with nine rifle divisions. Later, all of them except the 120th Guards 'Rogachev' Rifle Division were disbanded.\n\nThe army was briefly reformed with headquarters at Slutsk when the Belorussian Military District was being reformed, under the command of Colonel General Nikolai Gusev from July 1946, but was again disbanded in March 1947.\n\n\n\n"}

ESN provides information about academic exchange programmes and student mobility in general.\n\nIn 1987, the European Community approved a plan to create a mobility scheme for higher education. Part of it was the Erasmus programme - an exchange programme for students to provide students with the opportunity to spend part of their studies abroad.\n\nIn 1989 the Erasmus Bureau invited 32 former Erasmus Students for an evaluation meeting in Ghent, Belgium. This meeting was the starting point for the Erasmus Student Network. The lack of peer-to-peer support was singled out as a major issue and the driving force behind the creation of the Erasmus Student Network, named for the Dutch Renaissance humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam.\n\nBy 1994 ESN had 60 sections in 14 countries. In 2004 the ESN network consisted of 170 sections in and outside Europe, from Scandinavia to Morocco.

Together the local sections, or rather representatives from the sections form the Annual General Meeting (AGM), the highest decision-making body of ESN.\n\nThe national level represents the needs of international students towards governments and national authorities. Local sections in the same countries together form a National Platform (NP) who can elect a National Board and elects a National Representative (NR) to represent the national network on the international level.\n\nThe International Board is the executive body of ESN International and consists of five Board members (President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Communication Manager and Web Project Administrator). Since 2005, the members of the International Board are full-time volunteers living and working in Brussels. The International Board is supported by the Secretariat composed of employed staff.\n\nEach country elects a National Representative and all National Representatives form the Council of National Representatives (CNR).

It was inaugurated in 1991 and sponsored by the Amparo Foundation, which was founded in 1979 by Manuel Espinoza Yglesias in honor of his wife.\n\nThe museum is housed in two colonial-era buildings that date from the 17th and 18th centuries, which were popularly known as the Hospitalario. One of the buildings was the Hospital de Nuestra Señora y San Juan de Letrán founded in 1534. This building was made into a college for women by Bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza in the middle of the 18th century, and remained so until the 20th century. The other building is from the 18th century with a brick facade. It was part of the hospital for a time, then was converted into a “refuge” for married women. From 1871 to the 1980s, this building was the home of the Espinoza family. At that time, both buildings were restored and adapted for use as a museum.\nThe museum’s permanent collection traces Mexico’s development over its history. It has one of the most important collections of pre-Hispanic, colonial and modern art in Mexico, with dates of pieces ranging from 2,500 BCE to the present day, covering the pre-Classic period to the Spanish Conquest. The collection contains jars, figures, steles, altars, sculptures and utensils, from the Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Huasteca, Totonac, Maya, Olmec, Chichimeca, Mixtec and Aztec civilizations. The Colonial Area is concentrated what was the home of the Espinoza Family, occupying eleven halls.

{"id": "2192366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192366", "title": "Rectification (geometry)", "text": "Rectification (geometry)\n\nIn Euclidean geometry, rectification, also known as critical truncation or complete-truncation is the process of truncating a polytope by marking the midpoints of all its edges, and cutting off its vertices at those points. The resulting polytope will be bounded by vertex figure facets and the rectified facets of the original polytope. \n\nA rectification operator is sometimes denoted by the letter \"r\" with a Schläfli symbol. For example, \"r\"{4,3} is the rectified cube, also called a cuboctahedron, and also represented as formula_1. And a rectified cuboctahedron rr{4,3} is a rhombicuboctahedron, and also represented as formula_2.\n\nConway polyhedron notation uses \"a\" for ambo as this operator. In graph theory this operation creates a medial graph.\n\nThe rectification of any regular self-dual polyhedron or tiling will result in another regular polyhedron or tiling with a tiling order of 4, for example the tetrahedron {3,3} becoming an octahedron {3,4}. As a special case, a square tiling {4,4} will turn into another square tiling {4,4} under a rectification operation.\n\nRectification is the final point of a truncation process. For example, on a cube this sequence shows four steps of a continuum of truncations between the regular and rectified form:\n\nHigher degree rectification can be performed on higher-dimensional regular polytopes. The highest degree of rectification creates the dual polytope. A rectification truncates edges to points. A birectification truncates faces to points. A trirectification truncates cells to points, and so on.\n\nThis sequence shows a \"birectified cube\" as the final sequence from a cube to the dual where the original faces are truncated down to a single point:\n\nThe dual of a polygon is the same as its rectified form. New vertices are placed at the center of the edges of the original polygon.\n\nEach platonic solid and its dual have the same rectified polyhedron. (This is not true of polytopes in higher dimensions.)\n\nThe rectified polyhedron turns out to be expressible as the intersection of the original platonic solid with an appropriated scaled concentric version of its dual. For this reason, its name is a combination of the names of the original and the dual:\n\n\nExamples\nIf a polyhedron is not regular, the edge midpoints surrounding a vertex may not be coplanar. However, a form of rectification is still possible in this case: every polyhedron has a polyhedral graph as its 1-skeleton, and from that graph one may form the medial graph by placing a vertex at each edge midpoint of the original graph, and connecting two of these new vertices by an edge whenever they belong to consecutive edges along a common face. The resulting medial graph remains polyhedral, so by Steinitz's theorem it can be represented as a polyhedron.\n\nThe Conway polyhedron notation equivalent to rectification is ambo, represented by a. Applying twice aa, (rectifying a rectification) is Conway's expand operation, e, which is the same as Johnson's cantellation operation, t generated from regular polyhedral and tilings.\n\nEach Convex regular 4-polytope has a rectified form as a uniform 4-polytope.\n\nA regular 4-polytope {p,q,r} has cells {p,q}. Its rectification will have two cell types, a rectified {p,q} polyhedron left from the original cells and {q,r} polyhedron as new cells formed by each truncated vertex.\n\nA rectified {p,q,r} is not the same as a rectified {r,q,p}, however. A further truncation, called bitruncation, is symmetric between a 4-polytope and its dual. See Uniform 4-polytope#Geometric derivations.\n\nExamples\n\nA first rectification truncates edges down to points. If a polytope is regular, this form is represented by an extended Schläfli symbol notation t{p,q...} or r{p,q...}.\n\nA second rectification, or birectification, truncates faces down to points. If regular it has notation t{p,q...} or 2r{p,q...}. For polyhedra, a birectification creates a dual polyhedron.\n\nHigher degree rectifications can be constructed for higher dimensional polytopes. In general an n-rectification truncates \"n-faces\" to points.\n\nIf an n-polytope is (n-1)-rectified, its facets are reduced to points and the polytope becomes its dual.\n\nThere are different equivalent notations for each degree of rectification. These tables show the names by dimension and the two type of facets for each.\n\nFacets are edges, represented as {2}.\n\nFacets are regular polygons.\nFacets are regular or rectified polyhedra.\nFacets are regular or rectified 4-polytopes.\n\n"}

Born in Tucson, Arizona, Shannon moved to Dumas, Texas when he was nine, where he originally started as a guitarist, though he started playing bass at the age of 21. He appeared with Johnny Winter at Woodstock in 1969. He later joined Double Trouble in 1981 and became a permanent member of Double Trouble until Vaughan's death in 1990. Shannon and bandmate Chris Layton later formed supergroups such as the Arc Angels.\n\nShannon was born in Tucson, Arizona, and moved to the Texas Panhandle when he was nine. He grew up mainly in Dumas, Texas, north of Amarillo on Highway 287. Shannon joined his first band, The Avengers, around age 13. The band members were Shannon (guitar), Tim Easley (vocals), Jim Love (guitar) and David Davis (drums). It would be a while before they realized the importance of the bass guitar, but eventually Shannon did. Their first gig paid them $80. That excited them so much, they gave half their paycheck back.\n\nIn high school Shannon was in the band Ekos. Soon after high school he moved to Dallas and joined a soul cover band in 1966, initially called The New Breed, and later The Young Lads. Shannon recorded two 45s with this band, which featured Tim on vocals and Uncle John Turner on drums.\n\nShannon had the first of two important meetings at The Fog in Dallas in the late 1960s. There he first saw Johnny Winter. Shannon ended up backing Winter, and they formed a project known as The Progressive Blues Experiment in 1968. They cut one album for Sonobeat Records titled \"The Progressive Blues Experiment\" before being signed to Columbia Records by Clive Davis for $600,000 in 1969. Shannon appeared on both of these Columbia LPs, each released 1969; \"Johnny Winter\" (self-titled), and \"Second Winter\".\nAt Woodstock, Johnny's brother Edgar joined them onstage. Johnny Winter ended up moving to a band featuring Rick Derringer in early 1970 that already had a rhythm section, and there was no room for Shannon or Turner. They landed in a San Francisco band called Krackerjack that comprised Uncle John Turner, drums; Mike Kindred, piano; Shannon, bass; Bruce Bowland, vocals; and John Staehely, guitar, Jesse \"guitar\" Taylor played lead guitar with the band as well for a time during 1970 (there is a band photo as proof). According to Tommy's website, Stevie Ray Vaughan, known as \"Skeeter,\" was part of this band in its later Austin incarnation, along with Robin Syler on guitar. Among other personnel changes, Shannon eventually left the group and was replaced by Dwight Davis. Krackerjack remained a group from 1970 to 1973.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Shannon became involved with drugs, and began a cycle of jail, probation and rehab that would last for some time. He played with the Austin band The Fools briefly. Due to recurring drug arrests and failure of rehab in San Antonio and other locations, Shannon was finally sent to a \"farm\" in Buda and, as a result of his probation on release, he was not allowed to join any bands because of the pervasiveness of drugs in the music scene. Shannon became a bricklayer for a few years until he was eventually able to return to music in 1977. He played in a few unknown bands, then received a call from Rocky Hill, brother of ZZ Top's Dusty Hill. He moved to Houston to play with Hill and Uncle John, and in the late 1970s went on to play with Alan Haynes in the \"Texas Boogie Band\" (Shannon later played on Haynes' well received 1994 release, \"Wishing Well\"). Shannon also toured, opening for Bachman–Turner Overdrive and for KISS at the Warehouse in New Orleans.\n\nShannon moved between Dallas and Austin, and saw Stevie Ray Vaughan at The Fog with Vaughan's group Blackbird. Vaughan later formed a group called Double Trouble, and in 1980 Shannon wound up taking the place of the bass player, Jackie Newhouse, after seeing Double Trouble at Rockefellers in Houston. The group could have been short-lived—Vaughan was tapped to do some guitar tracks for David Bowie (the haunting guitar on \"Let's Dance\", for instance), and was then offered the chance to tour with Bowie. Ultimately, Vaughan's manager turned down the offer. Vaughan, Shannon and drummer Chris Layton would stay together as Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble—and become one of the most famous blues bands of all time.\n\nAfter joining Double Trouble, Shannon met his future wife Kumi and they eventually married in 1986. He had returned to ever-increasing drug use, this time with the band leader. Eventually both realized that they wouldn't last if that lifestyle continued, so they checked into rehabilitation in separate cities and both became clean and sober. Things seemed like they couldn't be better, with the band being healthier, making popular music, and gaining fame and fortune—until the helicopter carrying Vaughan crashed into a hillside after a show at Alpine Valley Music Theater, near East Troy, Wisconsin, on August 27, 1990, and all aboard died.\n\nAfter a period of mourning, Shannon's musical career eventually continued. He played with Doyle Bramhall, Denny Freeman and Chris Layton in The Mighty Zor. Shannon was asked by The Rolling Stones to audition to replace Bill Wyman, but did not get the role. Other notable projects included the Arc Angels with Doyle Bramhall II and Charlie Sexton, and Storyville with Malford Milligan. He toured with Susan Tedeschi and, along with Chris Layton, toured and recorded with Kenny Wayne Shepherd. He and Layton played on Jimmy D. Lane's \"It's Time\". He has played with other notable musicians, including Eric Clapton, The Rolling Stones, Little Richard, Hubert Sumlin, Mike McCready, Jonny Lang, Buddy Guy, Jimmie Vaughan, Eric Johnson, David Grissom, Mato Nanji, Jeff Beck, Lou Gramm and John Mayer.\n\nIn 1999 Shannon, in company with Chris Layton, provided the rhythm section for the Debbie Davies release “Tales From the Austin Motel” on Shanachie Records.\n\nIn 2001, Double Trouble reformed, releasing their only album without Vaughan. Titled \"Been a Long Time\", it featured many guest performers (including Tedeschi) filling Vaughan's frontman role.\n\nHis primary bass was a battered Arctic White 1962 Fender Jazz Bass with a red tortoise shell pickguard. He has been seen playing Yamaha BBs, Music Man StingRays, other Fender Precision and Jazz basses (mostly American, American Deluxe and Custom Shop models) and custom Fodera basses.\n\nShannon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Double Trouble in 2015.\n\n"}

It was a steam-powered design, using a wet heater engine burning decaline, with a typical range of about while running at . It was replaced beginning in 1942 by the electrically powered G7e torpedo, which did not leave a trail of bubbles in the water and thus did not reveal the location of the submarine. G7a's remained in service in other roles, including surface ships, until the end of the war.\n\nThe G7a (TI) torpedo was 533.4 mm (21 in) in diameter, 7163 mm (23 ft 6 in) in length (with a type Ka or Kb warhead and Pi1 or Pi2 pistol), the warhead holding a charge of approximately 280 kg (617lbs) of so-called Schießwolle 36. It was Kriegsmarine's first operational torpedo (hence \"TI\" = Torpedo number one), and the standard issue torpedo for all German U-boats and surface torpedo-bearing vessels from ca 1935 to the end of WW2.\nThe torpedo was of a straight-running unguided design, controlled by a gyroscope. The TI was of variable speed, running a distance of 5,000 m at 81 km/h (5,500 yd at 44kt), 7,500 m at 74 km/h (8,250 yd at 40 kt), and 12,000 m at 55.6 km/h (13,200 yd at 30 kt). The 44 kt setting was used only by torpedo boats like the \"Schnellboote\" on torpedoes with a reinforced engine.\n\nThe TI was the last naval torpedo of German design in operational use with the traditional standard wet heat method of propulsion. The torpedo was powered by an engine fed by a mixture of compressed air and steam. Decaline fuel was burning in a combustion chamber, creating steam from fresh water. The torpedo's speed was determined by the level of pressure (three settings for 30/40/44 kn) from the low-pressure regulator feeding air to the bottom of the combustion chamber. The resulting superheated steam powered a four cylinder reciprocating engine, in turn powering a pair of contra-rotating propellers.\n\nThough this system of propulsion gave the TI great speed and endurance – the greatest of any production model German torpedo of World War II – it had the distinct disadvantage of being very noisy and leaving a long wake of bubbles, common to most torpedoes of the period, with the exception of the Japanese Type 93 and submarine Type 95, which were fuelled by enriched oxygen. For U-boats, this relegated the TI for use mainly at night, when its wake was least noticeable, so as to not give away the element of surprise and the location of the submarine that fired it. During daytime, the electric torpedoes were favoured.\n\nThe TI was initially fitted with a combined mechanical/magnetic exploder, which was inadequately tested (like the U.S. Navy's Mark 14), having never been live fired. In addition, because the G7a's performance had never been assessed, between deep running and premature explosions (both also familiar to the Mark 14), the G7a suffered a thirty percent failure rate early in World War II. The response of the high command, ignoring complaints and blaming the operators, was also common to the U.S. Pacific Fleet's Submarine Force. The problems were so serious, Admiral Dönitz said, \"...never before in military history has a force been sent into battle with such a useless weapon.\"\n\nThere is at least one recorded case of a U-boat being bombed based upon her position being given away by a TI's wake. On 14 September 1939, \"U-30\" was attacked by loitering United Kingdom Fairey Swordfish naval bombers when she fired a TI from her stern torpedo tube at the SS \"Fanad Head\". \"U-30\" was undamaged in the attack and served until she was scuttled at the end of the war.\n\nThough the T1 could easily be spotted by surface ships, it remained the torpedo of choice for some U-Boat captains until the release of the G7e(TIII) electric torpedo in 1942, largely due to the inferior performance and tendency of the G7e(TII) (the wakeless electric torpedo available to U-boats from 1939–1942) to fail to detonate, both on proximity and contact fuses.\n\nThe TI were also issued in versions with programmed-steering gyroscopes, using the Fat I ladder search pattern and the Lut I or Lut II pattern running for attacking convoys.\n\n\nNote 1) 44kn was to be used by S-Boote (problems with initial design led to breakdown on motors running 44 kn, so this setting was banned until the new engine was available).\nNote 2) Black used only from shore torpedo batteries, red from surface vessels and blue from submarines.\nNote 3) Early versions had 4-blade propellers.\n\nPost war use:\nThe TI were used post-war by several navies with different modifications and designations (Marina Española: G-7a, Bundesmarine: DM11, Royal Danish Navy: T1T, Royal Norwegian Navy: T1 mod 1). Last known operator was RNoN with the T1 mod 1 (G7a with wire-guidance: Although four modifications to the torpedo were carried out over the years – the last with computerised control in 1992 – the same designation \"mod 1\" was applied throughout its service). In the RNoN, T1 mod 1 was used from FACs (until 1992), submarines (until the 1980s) and Coastal artillery shore batteries (until 1999).\n\nOther versions:\n\nNote 1) For launch with program setting, speed could only be set to 30 kn.

{"id": "2192413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192413", "title": "Preselector gearbox", "text": "Preselector gearbox\n\nA preselector gearbox is a type of manual transmission mostly used on passenger cars and racing cars in the 1930s, in buses from 1940-1960 and in armoured vehicles from the 1930s to the 1970s. The defining characteristic of a preselector gearbox is that the gear shift lever allowed the driver to \"pre-select\" the next gear, usually with the transmission remaining in the current gear until the driver pressed the \"gear change pedal\" at the desired time.\n\nThe design removed the need for the driver to master the timing of using a clutch pedal and shift lever in order to achieve a smooth shift in a non-synchromesh manual transmission. Most pre-selector transmissions avoid a driver-controlled clutch entirely. Some use one solely for starting from a standstill. Preselector gearboxes were most common prior to the widespread adoption of the automatic transmission, so they were considered in comparison to the \"crash gearbox\" type of manual transmission.\n\nPreselector gearboxes were often marketed as \"self-changing\" gearboxes, however this is an inaccurate description as the driver is required to choose the gear (and often manually actuate the gear change). An automatic transmission is a true \"self-changing gearbox\" since it is able to change gears without any driver involvement.\n\nThere are several radically different mechanical designs of preselector gearbox. The best known is the Wilson design. Some gearboxes, such as the Cotal, shift gears immediately as the control is moved, without requiring the separate gear change pedal.\n\nCompared with the contemporary (non-synchromesh) manual transmissions, preselector gearboxes were easier for drivers to operate smoothly, since they did not require techniques such a double de-clutching. Preselector gearboxes also had faster shift times, could handle greater power outputs and had less mass and could shift under load.\n\nA design advantage of many preselector gearboxes is that the friction components are brakes, rather than clutches. This meant that non-rotating brake bands could be used for the parts which are subject to wear, which results in a simpler design than a rotating component such as a typical clutch. The wearing components could also be mounted on the outside of the mechanism (rather than buried within it), providing easier access for maintenance and adjustment.\n\nThe most common type of pre-selector gearbox was the Wilson, which used an epicyclic design. A precursor to the Wilson gearbox was the manually-controlled epicyclic gearbox used in the 1901-1904 Wilson-Pilcher cars built in the United Kingdom. One of the company directors, Walter Gordon Wilson, had become an advocate for the benefits of the epicyclic gearbox, which allowed large torques to be transmitted whilst still being controllable through a small input force. Walter Wilson was a major co-inventor of the armoured tank during and after World War I, and was responsible for the 1918 British Mark V tank using an eypicyclic steering gearbox. The Lanchester Motor Company in the United Kingdom also produced cars with manually-controlled epicyclic gearboxes from 1900 and built an experimental tank (the \"Lanchester Gearbox Machine\" or \"Experimental Machine K\") fitted with an epicyclic gearbox.\n\nWalter Wilson continued experimentation with epicyclic gearboxes for cars and in 1928 his \"Wilson gearbox\" was invented. Walter and one of the co-owners of Armstrong Siddeley Motors formed the Self-Changing Gears Ltd. company (initially called \"Improved Gears Ltd.\") to design and build the Wilson gearbox. The 1929 Armstrong Siddeley Thirty was one of the first cars to use the Wilson gearbox. The gearbox was also built under licence by other manufacturers including Cord, ERA, Daimler and Maybach.\n\nThe driver pre-selected the next gear using a lever mounted to the steering wheel, then pressed the 'gear change pedal' (often located in place of the usual clutch pedal) to activate the gearchange at the desired time.\n\nThe Wilson gearbox was produced with a variety of clutches. The best-known is the fluid flywheel, used for touring cars such as the Daimler (Armstrong Siddeley used a centrifugal clutch). Sports cars used a Newton centrifugal clutch. This was a multiple plate dry clutch, similar to racing manual clutches of the time, but with the pressure plate centrifugally actuated to engage at around 600rpm. Pure racing cars, such as the ERA, avoided a clutch altogether and relied on the progressive engagement of the gearbox's band brake on lowest gear when starting. When fitted with a centrifugal clutch or fluid coupling, starting from a standstill involved simply selecting first gear, then the clutch would automatically engage once the accelerator pedal was pressed. On other cars, the gear change pedal functioned like a clutch when starting from a standstill. \n\nThe Wilson gearbox relied on a number of epicyclic gears, coupled in an ingenious manner that was also Wilson's invention. Successive gears operated by compounding or 'reducing the reduction' provided by the previous gear. A separate epicyclic was required for each intermediate gear, with a cone clutch for the straight-through top gear and a further epicyclic for reverse. Four gears were provided, at a time when many cars (especially American ones) usually only had a three speed gearbox. This was owing to the sporting, or indeed racing, market for the Wilson gearbox, so that the ratios could be more closely spaced. Although this same arrangement of epicyclics would become the precursor for the post-war automatic transmission, the automatic transmission's use of a torque converter, together with the broad power band and excess power of US V8 engines, meant that wider-spaced, thus fewer, ratios were acceptable. Unlike the \"crash\" gearboxes of the first half of the 20th century, the gearwheels in a preselector box are permanently in mesh in an epicyclic layout.\n\nChanging gear with the Wilson box relied on the control of the brake bands that held each epicyclic's annulus in fixed position. The brake band to be selected was controlled by a rotating cam, moved by the gear shift lever. Only one band was engaged for each gear selection. This small hand-operated lever could not provide enough power to engage and lock the brake band, thus the need for the foot pedal. The actual movement of the brake bands was controlled by the 'toggle' mechanism, a distinctive feature of the Wilson design. When the pedal was pressed and released, a series or 'busbar' of finger-like levers were pressed upwards by a strong coil spring, against a series of light linkages or 'operating struts'. The position of each linkage was controlled by the gear selection camshaft. If the cam (for each gear) held the linkage in place, rather than allowing it to swing out of the way, the busbar finger would then press, via the operating strut, onto the toggles controlling the brake bands themselves. These toggles provided the additional leverage necessary to hold the brake band in place, under the force of the coil spring, until the pedal was next pressed. A further characteristic of the Wilson design was the use of self-adjusting nuts on each band, to compensate for wear. The action of engaging and disengaging each band was sufficient to advance the ratchet nuts and so adjust for wear by taking up any slack.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, several French luxury car manufacturers used three-speed or four-speed preselector gearbox manufactured by Cotal. A unique aspect of the Cotal gearbox was the use of electromagnetic clutches (instead of band brakes) to engage the gears. A downside to this approach was that a loss of electrical power meant that the engine could no longer drive the wheels. The clutches were controlled by a simple dashboard or column-mounted switch, described as \"a cherry on a cocktail stick\", and relays. There was no mechanical servo action, so no need for the Wilson's cam or toggle arrangements and the change gear pedal.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Humber cars were fitted with a four-speed preselector gearbox produced by Laycock-de Normanville. It was broadly similar to the Wilson, but used direct hydraulic actuation of the brake bands (selected via a lever on the steering column) therefore avoiding the need for a change-gear pedal.\n\nSeveral Talbot cars in the 1930s— such as the 1932-1935 Talbot AX65 Darracq— used an \"accelerating gearbox\" designed by Georges Roesch, based on the Wilson patents. The Roesch gearbox was vastly revised in both design and materials, resulting in a lighter gearbox that was able to withstand three times the power of the Wilson gearbox.\n\nThis gearbox would automatically pre-select first gear when reverse was engaged. On engaging second gear, the gearbox would then pre-select third, and fourth when third was engaged. It would then cycle between third and fourth until another gear was pre-selected manually. Initial versions were produced without any form of clutch, however a centrifugal clutch was soon added to the design. Described by Talbot as the 'Traffic Clutch'. this was a simple device, with two radially swinging shoes (similar to a drum brake).\n\nAn early pre-selector gearbox was a prototype three-speed motorcycle gearbox patented by in France in 1906 the design and production were very compact..\n\nThe 1942-1945 German Tiger I armoured tank used a form of pre-selective gearbox that was built by Maybach and offered 8 ratios. The shift mechanism was hydraulic, to reduce driver effort. Clutches were used in combinations, allowing many more ratios than actuators. There were three hydraulic cylinders, each with two positions and controlling dog clutches for gear trains arranged on four shafts. The cylinders were controlled by a rotary valve on a simple quadrant gear lever and activated by pushing the lever sideways into its gate. The combination of the three cylinders permitted eight different ratios, although in reverse these were limited to just the lowest four. When a captured Tiger I tank was studied by the British in 1943, the report on the gearbox was carried out by Armstrong Siddeley motors.\n\nA multi-clutch gearbox avoids the difficulties of shifting gear by avoiding the need to \"shift\" at all. It operates as a number of separate gearboxes, each one controlled by a separate clutch, interlocked to avoid multiple selection. Selecting a gear is a matter of selecting the appropriate clutch. An advantage of this type is that it's simple to arrange remote operation, as there is no gear shift linkage as such, merely duplication of a clutch linkage.\n\nThis type of gearbox appeared in the March 1917 Oldbury gearbox trials testing different transmissions on eight British Heavy Tanks. Each ratio has its own shaft, and its own clutch. Provided the clutches are interlocked so that only one may be engaged at a time, the system is simple.\n\nIn the early 1980s this transmission was developed for urban buses in the UK as the \"Maxwell\", with a four-speed gearbox. UK buses are mostly double-deckers with rear-mounted transverse engines. Their use also involves much stop-start driving, thus heavy clutch wear for conventional gearboxes. The advantage of this arrangement was its use of four clutches, all easily serviced from outside the engine assembly, without needing to remove the engine. The clutches were multi-plate oil-supplied wet clutches. The first gearboxes gained a reputation for unreliability and in 1985 the original developers, Brockhouse, licensed them to Avon Maxwell Transmissions. A developed version, with an enlarged oil pump, was available as a retrofit for most UK buses. An unusual feature of this gearbox was the ability to engage first and second gear simultaneously. This acted as a 50 hp hydraulic retarder.\n\nThe idea of rapid shifting by clutch alone has also been developed as the dual-clutch transmission, in recent high-performance cars. This combines the simplicity of a shifting gearbox with the rapid shifts of a clutch-based design. There are effectively two separate gearboxes, each offering alternate ratios from the overall set, and the two clutches select which gearbox is in effect. Changes within the gearbox are done automatically, to predict which ratio the driver will require next. Provided that the next ratio has been selected correctly (i.e. the computer guessed correctly as to an up-shift vs. a down-shift) the shift itself is merely a rapid movement of the clutch. Unexpected shifts may confuse the system though and it must first select the correct ratio before engaging the clutch, giving a far slower shift.\n\nSeveral other methods have been used to automate the process of clutch operation or gear selection, such as the automated manual transmissions introduced by several car manufacturers in the 1990s.\n\n\nPreselector gearboxes were used in several racing cars and motorbike, including the International Six Days Trial 1921 and 1922 – Switzerland were Marcel Viratelle motorcycles were entered with series motorcycles ;the 1935 ERA R4D, and hillclimbing cars such as the 1930s Auto Union 'Silver Arrows'.\n\nSeveral buses built in the United Kingdom from around 1940 to 1960 had preselector transmission, including those built by Leyland, Daimler and AEC. The AEC RT type, a bus commonly used in London during this period, used compressed air to actuate the gear shifts, while other gearboxes used mechanical actuation. \n\nTypical operation of London buses was they had a very low first gear, only used on hills, so the driver when starting would select second gear, depress and release the change gear pedal to engage the transmission, and then select third ready for changing gear on the move, all this done while the bus was still stationary. On starting, just the accelerator pedal was pressed, with the eventual shift into third gear made by simply pressing the gear change pedal.\n\nSome 1950s-era James motorcycles were built using Villiers engines and a preselector gearbox. These were operated by pressing the gear pedal down to select 1st gear, then pulling in the clutch lever and on its return the gear engaged and drove forward. Pressing the gear pedal again selected 2nd gear, which was engaged only after the lever has been pulled in again.\n\nSome early petrol- and diesel-engined railcars in the 1930s used the Wilson preselector gearbox. The AEC-engined GWR 'Flying Banana' railcars had such a gearbox.\n\n"}

She also served as regent of Cooch Behar during the minority of her son.\n\nIndira was born the only daughter of Sayajirao Gaekwad III' of and his second wife Maharani Chimnabai (1872–1958). She grew up with her several brothers at the opulent Lakshmi Vilas Palace in Baroda, and was betrothed at a young age to Madho Rao Scindia, the then Maharaja of Gwalior. During the period of engagement, Indira attended the Delhi \"durbar\" of 1911, where she met the Jitendra, younger brother of the then Maharaja of Cooch Behar. Within days, they were in love and had decided to marry.\n\nIndira knew that her parents would be aghast; many issues were involved: the diplomatic repercussions of breaking a standing engagement with the Scindia ruler of Gwalior, one of the premier 21-gun-salute princes of India; the scandal and universal opprobrium that would certainly ensue; also the fact that Jitendra was the younger son and thus unlikely ever to become king.\n\nIndira circumvented her parents by taking the initiative in breaking her engagement herself, a daring act for an 18-year-old Indian maiden of that era. She wrote to her fiancé saying that she did not wish to marry him. In Baroda, Indira's father received a single-sentence telegram from the Maharaja of Gwalior: \"\"What does the princess mean by her letter?\"\" This was the first inkling her stunned parents had of Indira's intentions. The Maharaja behaved in exemplary fashion, writing an understanding letter to Indira's father which he signed off as \"your son\"; however, the disgrace was great and was felt keenly by Indira's parents.\n\nThe breaking of the engagement was accomplished, but this defiance of her parents did not serve to reconcile them to her marrying Jitendra. Indira's parents apparently regarded Jitendra as a playboy from a feckless family; they even ventured to summon him and give him a personal warning to stay away. Nothing worked; Indira and Jitendra were equally adamant. Eventually, perhaps also in recognition of the fact that respectable alliances for Indira were now unlikely, her parents made a half-way compromise. They allowed Indira to leave their roof, proceed to London and wed Jitendra.\n\nIndira and Jitendra were wed at a hotel in London with no member of Indira's family present. They were wed by the rites of the Brahmo Samaj, the sect to which Jitendra's mother, Suniti Devi, daughter of Keshub Chunder Sen, adhered.\n\nIt happened that at the time of the wedding, Jitendra's elder brother, Rajendra Narayan, the Maharaja of Cooch Behar, was grievously ill. Within days of the wedding, he died of ailments arising from alcohol abuse, and Jitendra became maharaja of Cooch Behar. The couple lived a relatively happy life and rapidly became the parents of five children. However, alcoholism was endemic in Jitendra's family, and he died at a young age, within a decade of the wedding.\n\nIndira was now not only a young widow and the mother of five, but also regent of Cooch Behar during the minority of her elder son. She faced her situation not merely with courage but indeed with verve. Her administrative skills were deemed by observers very mediocre, but Indira quickly gained a reputation for her highly-active social life, and spent prolonged periods of time in Europe and away from Cooch Behar.\n\nIndira was the mother of three daughters and two sons.\n\nIndira's elder son assumed full powers as ruler of Cooch Behar in 1936. Indira thereafter spent a major portion of her time in Europe. Indira Devi faced many tragedies in her lifetime. Indira Devi lost two of her children: Princess Ila Devi who died at a very young age and Prince Indrajit Narayan Bhup, who died in an accidental fire leaving behind his wife Princess Kamala of Pithapuram. Maharani Indira Devi spent the last years of her life in Mumbai and died there in September 1968.\n\n"}

During the British Raj, the town of Cooch Behar was the seat of a princely state of Koch Bihar, ruled by the Koch dynasty.\n\nThe name \"Cooch Behar\" is derived from the name of the Koch or \"Rajbongshi\" tribes indigenous to this region for many centuries. The word \"behar\" is derived from \"vihara\".\n\nCooch Behar formed part of the Kamarupa Kingdom of Assam from the 4th to the 12th centuries. In the 12th century, the area became a part of the Kamata Kingdom, first ruled by the Khen dynasty from their capital at Kamatapur. The Khens were an indigenous tribe, and they ruled till about 1498 CE, when they fell to Alauddin Hussain Shah, the independent Pathan Sultan of Gour. The new invaders fought with the local Bhuyan chieftains and the Ahom king Suhungmung and lost control of the region. During this time, the Koch tribe became very powerful and proclaimed itself \"Kamateshwar\" (Lord of Kamata) and established the Koch dynasty.\n\nThe first important Koch ruler was Biswa Singha, who came to power in 1510 or 1530 CE. Under his son, Nara Narayan, the Kamata Kingdom reached its zenith. Nara Narayan's younger brother, Shukladhwaj (Chilarai), was a noted military general who undertook expeditions to expand the kingdom. He became governor of its eastern portion.\n\nAfter Chilarai's death, his son Raghudev became governor of this portion. Since Nara Narayan did not have a son, Raghudev was seen as the heir apparent. However, a late child of Nara Narayan removed Raghudev's claim to the throne. To placate him, Nara Narayan had to anoint Raghudev as a vassal chief of the portion of the kingdom east of the Sankosh river. This area came to be known as Koch Hajo. After the death of Nara Narayan in 1584, Raghudev declared independence. The kingdom ruled by the son of Nara Narayan, Lakshmi Narayan, came to be known as Cooch Behar. The division of the Kamata Kingdom into Koch Behar and Koch Hajo was permanent. Koch Behar aligned itself with the Mughal Empire and finally joined the India as a part of the West Bengal, whereas remnants of the Koch Hajo rulers aligned themselves with the Ahom kingdom and the region became a part of Assam.\n\nAs the early capital of the Koch Kingdom, Cooch Behar's location was not static and became stable only when shifted to Cooch Behar town. Maharaja Rup Narayan, on the advice of an unknown saint, transferred the capital from Attharokotha to Guriahati (now called Cooch Behar town) on the banks of the Torsa river between 1693 and 1714. After this, the capital was always in or near its present location.\n\nIn 1661 CE, Maharaja Pran Narayan planned to expand his kingdom. However, Mir Jumla, the subedar of Bengal under the Mughal emperor Aurangazeb, attacked Cooch Behar and conquered the territory, meeting almost no resistance.\nThe town of Cooch Behar was subsequently named Alamgirnagar. Maharaja Pran Narayan regained his kingdom within a few days.\n\nIn 1772–1773, the king of Bhutan attacked and captured Cooch Behar. To expel the Bhutanese, the kingdom of Cooch Behar signed a defence treaty with the British East India Company on 5 April 1773. After expelling the Bhutanese, Cooch Behar again became a princely kingdom under the protection of British East India company.\n\nThe Victor Jubilee Palace was based on Buckingham Palace and built in 1887, during the reign of Maharaja Nripendra Narayan. In 1878, the maharaja married the daughter of Brahmo preacher Keshab Chandra Sen. This union led to a renaissance in Cooch Behar state. Maharaja Nripendra Narayan is known as the architect of modern Cooch Behar town.\n\nUnder an agreement between the kings of Cooch Behar and the Indian Government at the end of British rule, Maharaja Jagaddipendra Narayan transferred full authority, jurisdiction and power of the state to the Dominion Government of India, effective 12 September 1949. Eventually, Cooch Bihar became part of the state of West Bengal on 19 January 1950, with Cooch Behar town as its headquarters.\n\nA geopolitical curiosity was that there were 92 Bangladeshi exclaves, with a total area of 47.7 km² in Cooch-Behar. Similarly, there were 106 Indian exclaves inside Bangladesh, with a total area of 69.5 km². These were part of the high stake card or chess games centuries ago between two regional kings, the Raja of Cooch Behar and the Maharaja of Rangpur.\n\nTwenty-one of the Bangladeshi exclaves were within Indian exclaves, and three of the Indian exclaves were within Bangladeshi exclaves. The largest Indian exclave was Balapara Khagrabari which surrounded a Bangladeshi exclave, Upanchowki Bhajni, which itself surrounded an Indian exclave called Dahala Khagrabari, of less than one hectare (link to external map here ).

Cooch Behar is located in the northeastern part of the state and bounded by the district of Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar in the north, Dhubri and Kokrajhar district of Assam in the east and by Bangladesh in the west as well as in the south.

He is a graduate of the History and History of Art Faculty of the University of Wroclaw. Fydrych began his independent public activity in the 1970s. He created a branch of the Independent Students Union (NZS) in Wrocław and launched the Movement for New Culture in the city. He was also one of the co-organizers of a massive peace march that took place in April 1981.\n\nDuring the Martial Law, many Poles first made acquaintance with Fydrych's work through his picturesque dwarf images painted on building walls, covering up the paint that was used to cover up anti-regime slogans.\n\nStarting in 1986, he began organizing a chain of happenings, which were eventually named the \"Orange Alternative.\" These happenings involved hundreds up to thousands of participants at a given time. At its heyday in 1987, 1988 and 1989, Major Fydrych's \"Orange Alternative\" spread to other Polish cities, Warsaw, Łódź, Wrocław and Lublin being the most active. Altogether in the period of 1986 to 1990 the Orange Alternative organized over 60 street happenings.\nIn March 1988, after distributing women's sanitary pads on the street (an item that was in severe shortage in Communist Poland), Waldemar Fydrych was arrested and sentenced by the Court of Justice to three months of imprisonment. He was released following general public uproar, including a letter to the military junta signed by the foremost Polish intellectuals and artists.\n\nAt the time of the communist regime, when Fydrych was called upon to fulfill his military service obligation, he appeared before the army commission dressed in a uniform of a major. Unwilling to enter the army, he pretended the opposite, simulating madness. Asked to use an appropriate tone in regard to his superiors, Fydrych began addressing his interlocutors per \"colonel,\" at the same time describing himself as a \"major,\" a nickname which remained with him ever since.\n\nFydrych, alongside a group of students, participated in the Orange Revolution in Ukraine organizing events in Poland and Ukraine. He and the students made in the streets an \"Orange Scarf\" of support for the revolution. This scarf was started in Warsaw by one of the icons of the Orange Revolution - famous Ukrainian singer Ruslana Lyzhichko. On the night of the \"Orange Victory,\" the 15-meter long scarf was handed by Lyzhichko to President Yushchenko as one of the main symbols of the brotherhood between Ukraine and Poland.\n\nIn 2002, Fydrych presented himself in elections to the post of the Mayor of the City of Warsaw. He also ran for mayor of Warsaw in 2006 elections, gaining 2914 votes (0,41%). His organization was \"Dolts and Dwarves\" (\"Gamonie i Krasnoludki\").\n\nIn 2012, Fydrych received Ph.D. in Fine Arts from the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, Poland after defending his thesis \"Happening as the integrating and healing operation transforming art and reality\" written under supervision of Professor Stanisław Wieczorek.\n\nIn 2013, Major Fydrych and his dwarf graffiti were featured in Brad Finger’s book „Surrealism - 50 Works of Art You Should Know” published by PRESTEL Publishing along with works of such great artists as Artaud, Duchamp, Buñuel, Dali and Picasso.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In September 1939, the Fourth Army took part in the Soviet invasion of Poland commanded by the future Marshal of Soviet Union V.I. Chuykov, the defender of Stalingrad. Its order of battle in that operation is listed here. Elements of the army, apparently 4th Battalion, 29th Light Tank Brigade, took part in the German–Soviet military parade in Brest-Litovsk on September 22, 1939.\n\nWhen the German invasion of the Soviet Union commenced on 22 June 1941, the Army was part of the Western Front and had the 28th Rifle Corps (6th Rifle Division and 42nd Rifle Division), 14th Mechanised Corps, and 49th and 75th Rifle Divisions, as well as the 62nd Fortified Region. General Colonel Pavlov, Commander of the Western Front, had decided to redeploy some of 4th Army’s troops early in 1941, and John Erickson wrote that 12th Rifle Division was accordingly moved into Brest, and HQ 14th Mechanised Corps to Kobrin, which in Erickson’s words, ‘deprived 4th Army simultaneously of its reserve and its second echelon.’\n\nIt should be clearly understood that John Erickson (historian) was writing in the pre-1990 period when formation designations could be unclear, sometimes to the point of deliberate deception (Soviet 'maskirovka'). According to Sharp the 12th Rifle Division was identified by the Germans on the Western Front, but the unit was assigned to the Far East for the entire war. The formation that appears to have been moved into Brest Fortress was 42nd Rifle Division.\n\nFacing the 4th Army across the Bug River was deployed the German Fourth Army, with twelve infantry divisions and a cavalry division, as well as Panzer Group 2. Some units faced several difficulties; when General Major A.A. Khorobkov, the army commander, saw his officers on 10 June, General Major Stepan Oborin, 14th Mechanised Corps commander, emphasized that more than half his soldiers were untrained recruits, that his artillery had received guns for which there was no ammunition, and that he only had enough lorries to make a quarter of the corps mobile – the rest would have to march.\n\nOn the eve of the attack, 4th Army suffered, as did many Soviet formations, from German communication sabotage. Units lost telephone connections, electrical power, and the Brest Fortress lost its water supply. From about 5 am on 22 June fierce fighting began around the Brest fortress, but the seven battalions around the fortress, from 28th Rifle Corps, were undermanned, disorganized, and slow off the mark to man the defences. Despite these deficiencies the final German reduction of the fortress took some time in the face of determined Soviet resistance. By 1600 hours on 22 June, 4th Army HQ was back at Zapruda, whereupon Front HQ ordered that 14th Mechanised Corps be launched in an attack to clear Brest and reach the frontier line. However the Army staff felt the plan had no chance of success, and so it proved; when the attack was launched the next day, only insignificant progress was made. Three days later Western Front ordered a general withdrawal to try to keep the frontier armies out of threatened German encirclement; 4th Army was directed to fall back on a line from Bytin to Pinsk. Further instructions came through from Pavlov after a chance meeting later the same day; to cover the concentration of reserve armies on the Dnieper, 4th Army was to hold the Shchara, the Slutsk ‘fortified district,’ and the Sluch river line. However the Slutsk fortified district, as the district commander reminded Khorobkov, had long ago been instructed to dispatch all its weapons to the Brest fortress (which was continuing to hold). The planned defence was thus practically non-existent, and Slutsk fell on 27 June.

The field staffs of the 52nd and 54th Armies were used to fill the command contingent of the Army. The new formation was made up of the 285th, 292nd, and 311th Rifle Divisions along with the 27th Cavalry Division, a Tank brigade, the 2nd Reserve aviation group, and other artillery and support units.\n\nThe Fourth Army participated in the defense and attack of Tikhvin from October to December 1941. On December 17, 1941, the Fourth Army was allocated to the Volkhov Front. From January 1942 to November 1943, the Fourth Army fought on the front in Volkhov and Leningrad while also doing many rear-area duties. Unlike in other parts of the Eastern Front, the Red Army was not making significant gains in the north by 1943.\n\nThe 4th Army was disbanded in November 1943 and set up again in January 1944 as part of the Transcaucasus Front. The staff of the 4th Army was formed from the staff of the 34th Army.

{"id": "2192476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192476", "title": "Battle of Prokhorovka", "text": "Battle of Prokhorovka\n\nThe Battle of Prokhorovka was fought on 12 July 1943 near Prokhorovka, southeast of Kursk in the Soviet Union, during the Second World War. Taking place on the Eastern Front, the engagement was part of the wider Battle of Kursk, and occurred when the 5th Guards Tank Army of the Soviet Red Army attacked the II SS-Panzer Corps of the German Wehrmacht in one of the largest tank battles in military history.\n\nIn April 1943, the German leadership began preparing for Operation Citadel, with the objective of enveloping and destroying the Soviet forces in the Kursk salient, by attacking and breaking through the base of the salient from north and south simultaneously. The German offensive was delayed several times due to the vacillation of the leadership and the addition of more forces and new equipment. The Soviet high command, Stavka, had learned of the German intentions, and therefore used the delay to prepare a series of defensive belts along the routes of the planned German offensive. The Soviet leadership also massed several armies deep behind their defences as the Stavka Reserve. This army group, the Steppe Front, was to launch counteroffensives once the German strength had dissipated. The 5th Guards Tank Army was the primary armoured formation of the Steppe Front.\n\nOn 5 July 1943 the Wehrmacht launched its offensive. On the northern side of the salient, the German forces bogged down within four days. On the southern side, the German 4th Panzer Army, with Army Detachment Kempf on its eastern flank, attacked the Soviet defences of the Voronezh Front. They made slow but steady progress through the Soviet defensive lines.\n\nAfter a week of fighting, the Soviets launched their counteroffensives – Operation Kutuzov on the northern side and a coinciding one on the southern side. On the southern side of the salient near Prokhorovka, the 5th Guards Tank Army engaged the II SS-Panzer Corps of the 4th Panzer Army, resulting in a large clash of armoured fighting vehicles. The 5th Guards Tank Army suffered significant losses in the attack, but succeeded in preventing the Wehrmacht from capturing Prokhorovka and breaking through the third defensive belt – the last heavily fortified one. The German high command, unable to accomplish its objective, cancelled Operation Citadel and began redeploying its forces to deal with new pressing developments elsewhere.\n\nThe Red Army went on a general offensive, conducting Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev on the southern side and continuing Operation Kutuzov on the northern side. The Soviet Union thus seized the strategic initiative on the Eastern Front, which it was to hold for the rest of the war.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the battle for the Donets, as the spring rasputitsa (mud) season came to an end in 1943, both the German and Soviet commands considered their plans for future operations. The Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and some senior Soviet officers wanted to seize the initiative first and attack the German forces inside the Soviet Union, but they were convinced by a number of key commanders, including the Deputy Supreme Commander Georgy Zhukov, to assume a defensive posture instead. This would allow the German side to weaken themselves in attacking prepared positions, after which the Soviet forces would be able to respond with a counter-offensive.\n\nStrategic discussions also occurred on the German side, with Field Marshal Erich von Manstein arguing for a mobile defence that would give up terrain and allow the Soviet units to advance, while the German forces launched a series of sharp counterattacks against their flanks to inflict heavy attrition. But for political reasons, German Chancellor Adolf Hitler insisted that the German forces go on the offensive, choosing the Kursk salient for the attack. On 15 April 1943 he authorised preparations for \"Unternehmen Zitadelle\" (Operation Citadel).\n\nThe German offensive plan envisioned an assault at the base of the Kursk salient from both the north and south, with the intent of enveloping and destroying the Soviet forces in the salient. The two spearheads were to meet near Kursk. From the south, the XLVIII Panzer Corps and General Paul Hausser's II SS-Panzer Corps, forming the left and right wings of the 4th Panzer Army commanded by Colonel General Hermann Hoth, would drive northward. The III Panzer Corps of Army Detachment Kempf was to protect Hoth's right flank. The 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf were under Army Group South, commanded by Manstein. Air support over the southern portion of the offensive was provided by Colonel General Otto Deßloch's Luftflotte 4 and its major air formation, the 8th Air Corps. The German offensive, originally slated to commence in the beginning of May, was postponed several times as the German leadership reconsidered and vacillated over its prospects, as well as to bring forward more units and equipment.\n\nThe Soviet leadership, through their intelligence agencies and foreign sources, learned about the German intentions, and therefore the multiple delays by the German high command, OKW, allowed them a great deal of time to prepare their defences. Employing defence in depth, they constructed a series of defensive lines to wear down the attacking panzer formations. Three belts made up of extensive minefields, anti-tank ditches, and anti-tank gun emplacements were created; behind those were an additional three belts, which were mostly unoccupied and less fortified. The Voronezh Front, commanded by General Nikolai Vatutin, defended the southern face of the salient. The Steppe Front, commanded by Colonel General Ivan Konev, formed the strategic reserve. It was to be held back east of the salient until the time was right for the Soviet counteroffensive. This formation included Lieutenant General Alexei Zhadov's 5th Guards Army and Lieutenant General Pavel Rotmistrov's 5th Guards Tank Army.\n\nThe Wehrmacht launched its attack on the morning of 5 July 1943 and met heavy resistance. There were far more Soviet anti-tank guns, minefields, anti-tank ditches and overall Soviet resistance than had been anticipated, making a breakthrough more difficult to achieve. Furthermore, from the outset they were subjected to frequent counterattacks from Soviet tank units. Despite this, by the end of 5 July the II SS-Panzer Corps had advanced through the first defensive belt on the southern side of the salient and reached the second, although the plan was to breach the first two belts and reach the third on the first day. Nonetheless, the panzer corps' penetration caused great concern among Soviet commanders, compelling Vatutin to commit almost all of Voronezh Front's operational reserves by the end of the first day.\n\nThe III Panzer Corps met with stiff resistance as well and had great difficulty creating and maintaining a bridgehead across the Northern Donets River. They eventually succeeded by the morning of 6 July, but the delay in their advance kept them from protecting the east flank of the II SS-Panzer Corps.\n\nLate on 6 July, the 5th Guards Tank and the 5th Guards Armies of the Steppe Front began moving up from their reserve position. The 5th Guards Tank Army covered the over three days, and arrived at the Prokhorovka area on the night of 9 July, and the 5th Guards Army's 33rd Guards Rifle Corps arrived at the settlement on the night of 10 July. Both armies completed their journey and deployment intact without any substantial interference from the Luftwaffe.\n\nSlow progress by the XLVIII Panzer Corps caused Hoth to shift elements of the II SS-Panzer Corps on 8 July to aid the XLVIII Corps' drive toward Oboyan and Kursk. On the same day, the Soviet units counterattacked the II SS-Panzer Corps with several tank corps. These attacks did not destroy the panzer corps as hoped, but slowed its progress. By the end of 8 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps had advanced about and broken through the first and second defensive belts.\n\nOn the following day, 9 July, a meeting of the commanders of the German forces on the northern side of the Kursk salient concluded that a breakthrough on the northern side of the salient was unlikely. Nevertheless, they decided to continue their offensive to maintain pressure and inflict casualties, thereby tying down the Soviet forces there. Any level of success for Operation Citadel now depended on a breakthrough being achieved by 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf on the southern side of the Kursk salient.\n\nOn the evening of 9 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps was ordered to shift its own forward progress, from due north to the northeast, toward the settlement of Prokhorovka. Hoth had formulated this move, and had discussed it with Manstein since early May, as he expected large Soviet armoured reserve forces to arrive from the east, and he did not want his corps to be caught crossing the Psel River when they arrived. The plan originally envisioned elements of XLVIII Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps joining in the attack toward Prokhorovka, but this could not be realised. The Soviet command, however, interpreted the change in direction to be a response to the heavy resistance the German forces had faced driving toward Oboyan, and incorrectly believed the change indicated the German panzer forces had been severely weakened.\n\nSoviet intelligence reports issued from 8 to 9 July reported that defensive works were being constructed by German infantry on the flanks of the 4th Panzer Army, and that German armoured formations were not present in these locations, despite the fact that Soviet armoured formations were situated opposite these flanks. Voronezh Front headquarters supposed the Germans must be reaching their limit, and on 10 July decided to set its counterattack to coincide with the planned Soviet counteroffensive on the northern side of the Kursk salient, Operation Kutuzov, which was set for 12 July.\n\nStarting on the morning of 10 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps began its attack toward Prokhorovka. Its 3rd SS-Panzergrenadier Division \"Totenkopf\" attacked across the Psel River and secured a bridgehead. The 1st SS-Panzergrenadier Division \"Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler\" captured \"Komsomolets\" State Farm and Hill 241.6. The 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Division \"Das Reich\" defended the panzer corps' flank from Soviet armoured counterattacks.\n\nThe II SS-Panzer Corps continued its attack toward Prokhorovka on 11 July. The advance of \"Leibstandarte\" was checked by the 2nd Tank Corps, which had been reinforced by the 9th Guards Airborne Division and 301st Anti-tank Artillery Regiment, both from the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps. \"Totenkopf\" was resisted by the 31st Tank Corps, the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps' 95th Guards Rifle Division, and the 11th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 10th Tank Corps. To the south of \"Leibstandarte\", the 2nd Guards Tank Corps and the 48th Rifle Corps' 183rd Rifle Division opposed the advance of \"Das Reich\".\n\nBy day's end on 11 July \"Leibstandarte\" had advanced deep into the Soviet third defensive belt. They had moved up the Psel corridor, cleared Soviet resistance at the \"Oktyabrsky\" (\"October\") State Farm (), crossed a 15-foot (4.6 m)-deep anti-tank ditch at the base of Hill 252.2 and seized the hill itself after a brief but bloody battle, leaving them only south of Prokhorovka. To its northwest, the panzergrenadiers of \"Totenkopf\" had achieved a bridgehead across the Psel and tanks had been brought across, but they had yet to take Hill 226.6 and there was a gap between \"Totenkopf\" and \"Leibstandarte\". To the south of \"Leibstandarte\", \"Das Reich\" had also met stiff resistance and lagged behind some . With its advance, \"Leibstandarte‍\" was exposed on both of its flanks.\n\nLate on 11 July the 5th Guards Tank Army prepared for its forthcoming counterattack. \"Leibstandarte\"s advance had disrupted Rotmistrov's preparations, as the assembly areas he intended to use for the tank army's 18th and 29th Tank Corps were in German hands by the end of the day, forcing him to hastily revise his plans and select new positions. The arrival of the 5th Guards Tank Army just days earlier was detrimental to it in two major ways: the tank unit commanders did not have an opportunity to reconnoitre the terrain they would be travelling across, and the supporting artillery was unable to site and spot their fire.\n\nLate on the evening of 11 July, Hausser, the commander of the II SS-Panzer Corps, issued orders for the next day's advance on Prokhorovka. It was known that the Red Army had dug in many anti-tank guns on the southwest slopes of Prokhorovka, making a direct attack by \"Leibstandarte\" very difficult. The plan was for \"Totenkopf\" to capture Hill 226.6, and advance northeast along the Psel River to the Kartashёvka-Prokhorovka road, and then strike southeast into the flank and rear of Soviet forces at Prokhorovka. \"Leibstandarte\" was ordered to make a limited advance and secure Storozhevoe and Lamki just outside Prokhorovka, then it and \"Das Reich\" were to wait until \"Totenkopf\"s attack had disrupted the Soviet positions, after which \"Leibstandarte\" was to attack the main Soviet defences on the southwest slope of Prokhorovka. To \"Leibstandarte\"s right, elements of \"Das Reich\" were also to advance eastward to the high ground south of Prokhorovka, then turn south away from Prokhorovka to roll up the Soviet defences opposing the III Panzer Corps' advance and force a gap. The 8th Air Corps was to concentrate its effort to supporting the advance of the II SS-Panzer Corps, with the XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west assigned limited air resources.\n\nThe 5th Guards Army and 5th Guards Tank Army of the Steppe Front had been brought up from reserve and reassigned to the Voronezh Front on 8 and 11 July respectively. On 11 July, Vatutin ordered the armies of the Voronezh Front to go over to the offensive on the following day. This Soviet counterattack on the southern side of the Kursk salient was planned to coincide with the offensive against Orel on the northern side, Operation Kutuzov. Vatutin ordered Rotmistrov to destroy the German forces near Prokhorovka with his 5th Guards Tank Army, without allowing the German forces to withdraw southward.\n\nFor the battle, Rotmistrov ordered his tanks to move forward at high speed to engage the German armour in order to nullify the advantages the Tiger tanks had in the range and firepower of their 88 mm guns. He believed the more manoeuvrable T-34 medium tanks would be able to quickly close in and obtain effective flanking shots against the German heavy tanks. In fact, Soviet intelligence had greatly overestimated the numbers of Ferdinand \"Jagdpanzer\" tank destroyers and Tiger tanks possessed by the II SS-Panzer Corps. In actuality there were no Ferdinands with the 4th Panzer Army or Army Group South, as they were all deployed on the northern side of the Kursk salient with the 9th Army. Soviet tank crews frequently mistook the versions of Panzer IV tanks that were armed with the 7.5 cm KwK 40 anti-tank gun, which also had extra armour added to their turret, for Tigers; therefore Soviet reports tended to overestimate the number of Tigers employed by the German side during the Battle of Kursk.\n\nSoviet air support in the southern part of the salient was provided by the 2nd Air Army and the 17th Air Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Stepan Krasovsky and Lieutenant General Vladimir Sudets, respectively. However, the bulk of the air support was committed in support of Soviet units attacking XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west of Prokhorovka and the III Panzer Corps to the southeast, and only limited numbers of aircraft were available to support 5th Guards Tank Army's attack.\n\nRotmistrov's plans for a counterattack were threatened by events to the south. The III Panzer Corps managed to cross the Northern Donets at Rzhavets on the night of 11 July, and was about southeast of Prokhorovka, and advancing northwards. This threat jeopardised Rotmistrov's entire plan by threatening the flank and rear of the 5th Guards Tank Army. Early on 12 July, Vatutin ordered Rotmistrov to send reinforcements to the Soviet 7th Guards and 69th Armies facing the III Panzer Corps. He organised a task force under the command of his deputy, Major General Kuzma Trufanov, which consisted of the 26th Guards Tank Brigade from the 2nd Guards Tank Corps, the 11th and 12th Guards Mechanized Brigades from the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps, and the 53rd Guards Tank Regiment of the 5th Guards Tank Army. Other units of the Voronezh Front also joined the group on its way south. In doing so, Rotmistrov committed over half of his army's reserves before the Battle of Prokhorovka had begun.\n\nThe German forces involved in the Battle of Prokhorovka were from the three Waffen-SS divisions of the II SS-Panzer Corps: \"Leibstandarte\", \"Das Reich\", and \"Totenkopf\". On the evening of 11 July, the serviceable armour strength of the II SS-Panzer Corps was 294 tanks and assault guns, which included 15 Tigers. The armoured strength of \"Leibstandarte\", \"Das Reich\", and \"Totenkopf\" were 77, 95, and 122 tanks and assault guns respectively. Ten of the Tigers were to the north of the Psel River with \"Totenkopf\", four were with \"Leibstandarte\", and \"Das Reich\" had just one.\n\n\"Leibstandarte\" had advanced the most deeply toward Prokhorovka and was situated in the centre of the German position. A railway line, with a 30-feet high railbed, divided \"Leibstandarte\"s area into north and south. The bulk of the division was positioned to the north of the rail line, including the division's 1st SS-Panzer Regiment and 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment, as well as its reconnaissance, artillery and command units. To the south of the rail line was \"Leibstandarte\"s 1st SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment, along with the division's 1st SS-Panzerjäger Battalion. \"Das Reich\" was positioned to the south of \"Leibstandarte\", and it protected the southern flank of the II SS-Panzer Corps. \"Totenkopf\" was positioned to the northwest of \"Leibstandarte\". \"Totenkopf\"s 3rd SS-Panzer Regiment had largely crossed over the Psel in preparation for the assault. \"Leibstandarte\" placed its lightly armed 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion in the gap between it and \"Totenkopf\" to provide some flank protection. The unit was, later on 12 July, buttressed by the division's four remaining Tigers, commanded by SS-Untersturmführer Michael Wittmann.\n\nThe main Soviet armoured formation involved in the battle was the 5th Guards Tank Army, which controlled five corps, two of which were Guards units, by 12 July: the 2nd Guards, 2nd, 5th Guards Mechanized, 18th and 29th Tank Corps. Altogether they fielded 793 tanks and 37 to 57 self-propelled guns for a total of approximately 840 armoured fighting vehicles. About two-thirds of these tanks were T-34s, while the remainder were T-70 light tanks, with some 31 to 35 Churchill heavy tanks as well. Not all of the 5th Guards Tank Army was present in the Prokhorovka area during the battle, as part of the formation had been sent south to check the advance of the III Panzer Corps. The Soviet armour of the 5th Guards Tank Army – including the newly attached 2nd Guards Tank Corps and 2nd Tank Corps, as well as the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps held in reserve – that faced the II SS-Panzer Corps on 12 July was about 616 tanks and self-propelled guns. In addition, five artillery regiments, one artillery brigade, and one anti-aircraft artillery division were attached to the 5th Guards Tank Army for the assault.\n\nThe main attack of the 5th Guards Tank Army was conducted against \"Leibstandarte\" by its fresh 29th and 18th Tank Corps that had been brought up from the Soviet strategic reserve. These two Soviet tank corps together provided the greatest number of tanks in the attack, with the 18th Tank Corps fielding 190 tanks and self-propelled guns, and the 29th Tank Corps fielding 212 tanks and self-propelled guns. Infantry support to the 18th and 29th Tank Corps was provided by the 9th Guards Airborne Division. A portion of the 18th Tank Corps was directed against the eastern flank of \"Totenkopf\"s 6th SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment \"Theodor Eicke\". On the southeastern wing of the 5th Guards Tank Army, Rotmistrov deployed the 120 tanks of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps. Later on 12 July during the battle, the 26th Guards Tank Brigade of that tank corps with its estimated 40 tanks were sent south to face the III Panzer Corps. The remainder of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps, supported by the remnants of the 2nd Tank Corps, was to attack \"Das Reich\". Their infantry support was provided by the 183rd Rifle Division. The western flank of the 5th Guards Tank Army, which faced \"Totenkopf\", was defended by the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps' 42nd and 95th Guards Rifle Divisions, which were supported by the remnants of the 31st Tank Corps and the heavily depleted 23rd Guards Rifle Corps' 52nd Guards Rifle Division. The forces of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps that were not sent south were held as reserve northwest of Prokhorovka, and they numbered about 113 tanks and self-propelled guns.\n\nVatutin directed Soviet air assets to commit their main effort toward checking the III Panzer Corps' drive northward, and in supporting the attack against the XLVIII Panzer Corps. Missions were flown in support of the attack of the 5th Guards Tank Army as well, but to a limited extent. The 2nd Air Army had some 472 aircraft operational on 12 July, while the 17th Air Army had 300 operational aircraft.\n\nAt 05:45 on 12 July, \"Leibstandarte\"s headquarters started receiving reports of the sound of many tank engines as the Soviet tanks moved into their assembly areas for the attack. At around 06:50, elements of \"Leibstandarte\"s 1st SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment nudged forward and drove the Soviet infantry out of Storozhevoe, while elements of the division's 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment fanned out from the \"Oktyabrsky\" State Farm. The Soviet forces began a preparatory artillery barrage at around 08:00, and as the last shells fell at 08:30, Rotmistrov radioed the code words \"Stal! Stal! Stal!\" (\"Steel, Steel, Steel!\") – the order to commence the attack. With that the Soviet armour of the 5th Guards Tank Army began their advance.\n\nIn total, about 500 tanks and self-propelled guns of the 5th Guards Tank Army attacked the positions of the II SS-Panzer Corps on 12 July, doing so in two waves, with 430 tanks in the first echelon and 70 more in the second.\n\nDown from the slopes in front of Prokhorovka, the massed Soviet armour charged with five tank brigades of the 18th and 29th Tank Corps, firing as they came at \"Leibstandarte\"s positions. As the Soviet tanks rolled down the slopes, they carried the men of the 9th Guards Airborne Division on their hulls (\"tank desant\"). The troops of \"Leibstandarte\" were not slated to go into action until later in the day. Exhausted from the previous week's fighting, many were just starting their day at the outset of the attack. As the Soviet armour appeared, German outposts all across the corps' frontage began firing purple warning flares signalling a tank attack. Obersturmbannführer Rudolf von Ribbentrop, commander of a panzer company under the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment, stated that he knew at once a major attack was underway. He ordered his company of seven Panzer IVs to follow him over a bridge across an anti-tank ditch. Crossing the bridge they fanned out on the lower slope of Hill 252.2. On the crest of the hill, Sturmbannführer Joachim Peiper's 3rd Panzergrenadier Battalion of the 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment were being overrun.\n\nAs Ribbentrop's tanks spread out, he and the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment were suddenly confronted by Soviet tanks of the 29th Tank Corps' 31st and 32nd Tank Brigades: \"About 150–200 meters in front of me appeared fifteen, then thirty, then forty tanks. Finally there were too many of them to count.\" The Soviet armour, firing on the move, charged down the western slopes of Hill 252.2 into the panzer company, and a tank battle ensued. Rotmistrov's tactic to close at high speed disrupted the control and co-ordination of the Soviet tank formations and also greatly reduced their accuracy. In a three-hour battle, the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment engaged the attacking Soviet tanks and repulsed them, reporting that they destroyed about 62 Soviet tanks. Later that afternoon, tanks from the 31st Tank Brigade and the 53rd Motorized Brigade overran elements of the 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion and reached \"Komsomolets\" State Farm, threatening \"Leibstandarte\" lines of communication and the division's command post located at Hill 241.6. The Soviet tanks attacked the division's 1st SS-Panzer Artillery Regiment, killing some of the crews before they themselves were destroyed by direct fire from anti-tank teams.\n\nWittmann's group of four Tigers provided support to the reconnaissance battalion in its effort to protect \"Leibstandarte\"s left flank, and faced off with the 18th Tank Corps' advancing 181st Tank Brigade. In a three-hour battle the Tigers engaged the Soviet tanks at ranges from 1,000 metres down to point-blank, inflicting heavy losses on the Soviet tankers and successfully repelling their attack. None of the Tigers were lost. Later, elements of the 170th Tank Brigade engaged the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment, which was already fighting the 31st and 32nd Tank Brigades. Despite losing its commander and about 30 tanks in the fight, by early afternoon the 170th Tank Brigade had forced the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment back to the \"Oktyabrsky\" State Farm and reached the position of the 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion. At around 18:00, the 170th and 181st Tank Brigades penetrated the German line connecting \"Totenkopf\" and \"Leibstandarte\". Assault guns and panzers supporting \"Totenkopf\"s 6th SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment \"Theodor Eicke\" repelled the Soviet attack and re-established the line, forcing the Soviet tanks to withdraw to the village of Andreevka.\n\nThe advance of Soviet armour down Hill 252.2 was disrupted when they reached the anti-tank ditch at the base of the hill. A number of tanks crashed into the 15-foot deep ditch while others moved along the edge looking for a way to cross. Heavy fire was exchanged between the Soviet tanks and two companies of a panzergrenadier battalion on the opposite side of the ditch. Peiper's surviving panzergrenadiers engaged the Soviet infantry and attacked the Soviet tanks with \"Hafthohlladung\" magnetic anti-tank grenades. Twenty of his battalion's half-tracks were lost in the fighting, some destroyed in ramming the much heavier Soviet tanks in an effort to stop them. Eventually, due to heavy Soviet pressure and dangerously exposed flanks, \"Leibstandarte\" withdrew from the \"Oktyabrsky\" State Farm and established firmer defensive lines to the south.\n\nThe 2nd and 17th Air Armies flew 893 sorties compared to the German 8th Air Corps's 654 sorties over the southern part of the salient. Of note, most of the Soviet sorties flown that day were flown against the XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west and the III Panzer Corps to the south. Low clouds in the morning and thunderstorms in the afternoon inhibited air operations over Prokhorovka for both sides. Over the Prokhorovka battlefield the Luftwaffe gained control of the air. Formations of Stukas, including a small number of the G-2 variants, experimentally equipped with twin \"Bordkanone\" BK 3,7 cannon in gun pods, that were commanded by Staffelkapitän Hans-Ulrich Rudel, attacked the Soviet formations. They were joined by Fw 190 single engine fighter-bombers and Hs 129 twin-engined ground-attack aircraft, both equipped with anti-tank cannon. In particular, the Hs 129 formations from SG 1 inflicted grievous losses on Soviet tanks. The Stuka wings, StG 2 and StG 77, made their weakest contribution to the Kursk operation since the 5 July—150 sorties—down from 1,071 on 5 July, but the small Ju 87G contingent proved effective. Luftwaffe liaison officers allotted to German ground forces were able to guide the close air support units to carry out pinpoint attacks. SG 1 and \"Panzerjägerstaffel\"/JG 51 flew 248 attack missions, virtually all of them in support of the II SS \"Panzerkorps\".\n\nThe 31st Tank Brigade, 29th Tank Corps, reported: \"We suffered heavy losses in tanks through enemy artillery and aircraft. At 10:30 our tanks reached the \"Komsomolets\" State Farm, but due to continuous air attacks, they were unable to advance any further and shifted to the defence.\" The tank brigade also reported: \"our own air cover was fully absent until 13:00.\" The 5th Guards Tank Army reported: \"the enemy's aircraft literally hung above our combat formations throughout the entire battle, while our own aircraft, and particularly the fighter aviation, was totally insufficient.\" The 36th Tank Brigade lost its commander to an air attack.\n\nGerman domination of the Prokhorovka air space occurred for several reasons. During the initial stages of the battle it was Soviet tanks that were hit and burned, obscuring the battlefield which made it difficult for Soviet commanders to develop a clear picture of the situation. Added to that was the failure to provide air liaison officers with Red Army forces, who were then unable to call for air support when the German assault formations first appeared. Whereas the German 8th Air Corps assembled powerful concentrations over the Prokhorovka battlefield, the 17th Air Army spread its forces thinly, to support other sectors; the Soviets dominated the air over the 4th Panzer Army's flanks, leaving the skies over Prokhorovka clear. The 2nd Air Army's fighter aviation had been reduced to 266, and this force was used in the fighter escort, not the air superiority role. The battle of Prokhorovka absorbed the 8th Air Corps' combat power to the extent it was unable to intervene to support the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, enabling Soviet defences to defeat the attempted breakthrough in that sector.\n\nThe posture, dispositions and tactics on 12 July led to few losses on either side in air combat. The 8th Air Corps reported 19 aircraft damaged and destroyed. Only one German aircraft was reported lost in combat with Soviet fighters; the rest were victims of Soviet ground-fire. In return, the 2nd Air Army reported 14 fighters damaged and destroyed (German fighter pilots claimed only seven; though they claimed 16 aircraft of all types shot down). Soviet bomber losses are unknown.\n\nBy the end of the day, \"Leibstandarte\" still held Hill 252.2, but had been exhausted by the effort of turning back five Soviet tank brigades. To its left, \"Totenkopf\" had succeeded in capturing Hill 226.6 and had advanced along the northern bank of the Psel River to reach the Karteschevka–Prokhorovka road, northwest of Prokhorovka in accordance with plan. It was in position to outflank the Soviet forces at Prokhorovka, but was under pressure from Soviet attacks and its hold on the forward ground was tenuous. Forced onto the defensive by the attacks of the 2nd Guards and 2nd Tank Corps, \"Das Reich\" was unable to conduct its planned offensive manoeuvres.\n\nOn the Soviet side, all the tank units under Rotmistrov's 5th Guards Tank Army involved in the battle on 12 July suffered heavy losses. Rotmistrov later wrote that the 29th Tank Corps lost 60 percent of its armour and the 18th Tank Corps lost 30 percent on 12 July. A Soviet General Staff report recorded: \"Thus on 12 July, the 5th Guards Tank Army failed to accomplish its assigned mission. As a result of the frontal attack, the army's corps fought heavy battles against large enemy tank forces during which they were forced to assume defence.\" Rotmistrov was forced to shift the 18th and 29th Tank Corps over to defence and reinforce them with infantry. They dug more trenches, dug in some of their tanks, laid new minefields, prepared anti-tank strong points and massed their artillery. The 10th Guards Mechanized and 24th Guards Tank Brigades of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps made preparations to push \"Totenkopf\" back the next morning.\n\nStalin was very disappointed and infuriated by the early reports of heavy Soviet losses in the battle and on the evening of 12 July, he berated Rotmistrov via a phone call. The same evening, he dispatched Zhukov, who had been overseeing Operation Kutuzov, to Vatutin's headquarters as Stavka representative, in order to assume control of coordinating the operations of the Voronezh and Steppe Fronts. A commission was dispatched to investigate the cause of the high losses and the role of Rotmistrov and his plans in the battle; its findings were completed and submitted to Stalin two weeks later, and initially considering sacking Rotmistrov and hauling him before a military tribunal, Stalin eventually changed his mind after the Chief of the General Staff Aleksandr Vasilevsky interceded.\n\nOn the night of 12 July, Vatutin ordered Soviet forces to prevent any further German advance on Prokhorovka, destroy German forces that had advanced along the northern bank of the Psel River, and stop the III Panzer Corps from making further progress. Orders issued by the German command for 13 July instructed \"Totenkopf\" to consolidate its gains of the previous day and then attack into the flank and rear of the Soviet forces around Prokhorovka. \"Leibstandarte\" was to strengthen its front line and co-ordinate its attack on Prokhorovka from the south with \"Totenkopf\"s attack from the northwest. \"Das Reich\" was to consolidate and strengthen its front line and prepare for an offensive operation to link up with the III Panzer Corps.\n\nOn the morning of 13 July, the 10th Guards Mechanized and 24th Guards Tank Brigades, in cooperation with the 95th and 52nd Guards Rifle Corps, launched attacks against \"Totenkopf\". These Soviet attacks preoccupied \"Totenkopf\" and prevented it from attacking toward Prokhorovka. Around noon, \"Leibstandarte\"s 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion was ordered to attack northward toward the Psel River to consolidate its front line with \"Totenkopf\", while the division's panzer units were to attack toward Soviet positions northeast of the \"Oktyabrsky\" State Farm toward Prokhorovka.\n\nThe 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion attacked the defensive positions held by the 42nd Guards Rifle Division and the remaining armour of the 18th Tank Corps, while the panzer units attacked the defences of 9th Guards Airborne Division and the 29th Tank Corps. These German attacks were repelled by concentrated anti-tank artillery fire. The 29th Tank Corps responded with a counterattack and penetrated German lines, reaching \"Komsomolets\" State Farm before being beaten back by direct fire from German artillery. That afternoon, \"Totenkopf\" was ordered to abandon their positions northwest of Prokhorovka and return to tenable positions around Hill 226.6. Soviet attempts to sever the narrow salient were unsuccessful, and \"Totenkopf\" completed its withdrawal by nightfall.\n\nOn 13 July Hitler summoned Manstein and the commander of Army Group Center, Field Marshal Günther von Kluge, to his headquarters, the \"Wolfsschanze\" in East Prussia. The Allied invasion of Sicily on the night of 9–10 July, combined with the Soviet counteroffensive of Operation Kutuzov against the flank and rear of General Walter Model's 9th Army on the northern side of the Kursk salient on 12 July, and the attacks by strong Soviet forces at Prokhorovka the same day had caused Hitler to stop the offensive and begin redeploying forces to the Mediterranean theatre. He ordered his generals to terminate Operation Citadel.\n\nKluge welcomed the decision, as he was already in the process of withdrawing units of the 9th Army from the northern side of the Kursk salient to deal with Soviet attacks on his flank. But Manstein was greatly disappointed. He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving a major breakthrough on the southern side of the salient. As he saw it, with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS-Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka, and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his operational reserve, they would be halting the offensive just at the moment when victory was in hand. With an eye toward the west, Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive. Manstein persisted, proposing that his forces should at least destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk salient before Citadel was finally terminated, so that the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted for the rest of the summer. Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern salient until Manstein's goal was achieved.\n\nAfter the meeting with Hitler on 13 July, Manstein hastily put together the plans for Operation Roland, realizing that he only had a few days to conduct the operation before he lost the II SS-Panzer Corps due to redeployment. The plan called for \"Das Reich\" to attack east and south and link up with III Panzer Corps, which would attack to the northwest. \"Totenkopf\" and \"Leibstandarte\" were to anchor the western and northern flanks of \"Das Reich\", respectively. Once the link was achieved and the Soviet forces encircled, Prokhorovka would then be attacked shortly thereafter by the combined forces of the II SS-Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps. The goal of the operation was to destroy the Soviet armoured reserves massed in the southern sector of the Kursk salient, and thereby check Soviet offensive capacity for the rest of the summer.\n\nThe orders for Operation Roland were issued in the closing hours of 13 July 1943. But after meeting with Manstein, Hitler countermanded the XXIV Panzer Corps' deployment to the Kursk salient, sending them on 14 July to support the 1st Panzer Army to the south. The assault began at 04:00 on 14 July. Following a brief artillery barrage, the 4th SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment \"Der Führer\" of \"Das Reich\" struck out for the high ground south-west of Pravorot, evicting the remnants of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps from the village of Belenikhino following house-to-house and hand-to-hand fighting. \"Das Reich\"s 2nd SS-Panzer Regiment fought off a series of counterattacks and forced the Red Army units to withdraw eastward to a new line. Zhukov ordered the 10th Guards Mechanized Brigade of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps to reinforce the line. The 7th Panzer Division of the III Panzer Corps made contact with \"Das Reich\", but Trufanov, commanding the Soviet forces in the gap, was aware of the threat and conducted a fighting withdrawal. The link-up failed to trap the Soviet forces, though they abandoned a substantial number of their anti-tank guns. Operation Roland failed to produce a decisive result for the German side, and \"Totenkopf\" began withdrawing from its positions north of the Psel, following orders issued late on 15 July, as the II SS-Panzer Corps assumed a defensive stance along its entire front.\n\nOn 17 July the Soviet Southwestern and Southern Fronts launched a major offensive across the Mius and Donets Rivers against the southern wing of Army Group South, pressing upon the 6th Army and 1st Panzer Army. In the early afternoon of 17 July, Operation Roland was terminated with an order for the II SS-Panzer Corps to begin withdrawing from the Prokhorovka sector back to Belgorod. The 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf anticipated the order and began executing it as early as the evening of 16 July. \"Leibstandarte\"s tanks were distributed between \"Das Reich\" and \"Totenkopf\", and the division was hastily redeployed to Italy, while \"Das Reich\" and \"Totenkopf\" were dispatched south to meet the new Soviet offensives.\n\nLosses for 12 July are difficult to establish for either combatant. Tank losses attributed to the German side vary, in part due to the Wehrmacht's methodology for counting and reporting equipment losses. Only equipment that could not be repaired or that had to be abandoned were counted as losses, but damaged equipment that could be recovered and repaired were simply listed as such. Likewise, reliable figures for tank and personnel casualties for the Red Army in the Battle of Prokhorovka are difficult to establish.\n\nThe II SS-Panzer Corps reported 842 soldiers killed, wounded, or missing for 12 July, and 2,672 for 12 to 16 July inclusive. Since the German forces controlled much of the Prokhorovka battlefield until 17 July, they were able to recover most of their disabled armoured vehicles. The II SS-Panzer Corps' logistics report for 12 July did not record any confirmed permanent tank losses. Other German sources show that three tanks of the II SS-Panzer Corps (two Panzer IVs and a Tiger) that were immobilized in the battlefield could not be subsequently recovered and therefore the permanent losses can only be adjusted to a possible maximum of three tanks for 12 July. A study by the US Army's Center for Strategy and Force Evaluation attributed six permanent tank losses, not counting Panzer I and Panzer II light tanks or German assault guns if any. Archival files of the II SS-Panzer Corps and 4th Panzer Army show that the II SS-Panzer Corps permanently lost 17 tanks and assault guns from 12 to 23 July inclusive, which therefore represents the maximum permanent losses the unit could have incurred for the engagement on 12 July up till the end of Operation Roland.\n\nArchival data of the II SS-Panzer Corps shows that the corps had 294 operable tanks and assault guns on the evening of 11 July, and 251 on the evening of 13 July. Allowing for the possibility that some repaired tanks were returned to service on 13 July, these numbers indicate that at least 43 tanks and assault guns became inoperable during this period, which includes all ten Tigers belonging to \"Totenkopf\" and one belonging to \"Leibstandarte\". An estimated total of 60–80 tanks and assault guns of the II SS-Panzer Corps were damaged or destroyed in combat on 12 July. By the end of 16 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps had 292 serviceable tanks and assault guns, almost the same number it had at the beginning of the battle on 12 July. On 12 July, Schlachtgeschwader 1 of the 8th Air Corps reported 11 aircraft damaged, all by Soviet anti-aircraft artillery, of which 6 were total write-offs.\n\nA document prepared on 17 July 1943 by the 5th Guards Tank Army headquarters summarised the combat losses incurred by the formation from 12 to 16 July inclusive for all of its five corps, as well as smaller units directly subordinated to the army headquarters. The document reported the following irrecoverable losses: 222 T-34s, 89 T-70s, 12 Churchills, 8 SU-122s, 3 SU-76s, and 240 support vehicles. The document reported damaged vehicles still under repair as 143 T-34s, 56 T-70s, 7 Churchills, 3 SU-122s, and 3 SU-76s, with no figures for support vehicles. The document reported personnel casualties as 2,940 killed in action, 3,510 wounded in action, and 1,157 missing in action. This totals 334 irrevocable losses in tanks and self-propelled guns, with another 212 tanks and self-propelled guns under repair, and 7,607 casualties. The historian Karl-Heinz Frieser argued that the majority of the losses reported in the document must have occurred on 12 July.\n\nSoviet personnel losses at Prokhorovka for 12 July were estimated by the historian Christer Bergström to have been as high as 5,500 men. For equipment damaged or destroyed, David Glantz and Jonathan House estimate that the whole 5th Guards Tank Army lost at least 400 tanks in its attacks on 12 July. The Soviet historians Grigoriy Koltunov and Boris Soloviev estimate about 300 tanks and self-propelled guns of 5th Guards Tank Army were damaged or destroyed on 12 July. The study by the US Army's Center for Strategy and Force Evaluation reports that the 2nd Guards, 18th and 29th Tanks Corps altogether permanently lost 144 tanks on 12 July, not including self-propelled guns. George Nipe estimates that 600–650 tanks of the 5th Guards Tank Army were damaged or destroyed while fighting both the II SS-Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps on 12 July.\n\nDebate exists over the significance and outcome of the battle. The German forces destroyed many Soviet tanks and temporarily degraded the striking power of the 5th Guards Tank Army, but they were unable to take Prokhorovka or break through into open ground before developments elsewhere forced the termination of Operation Citadel. For the Soviet side, the massive armoured attack of 12 July failed to destroy the II SS-Panzer Corps, but succeeded in exhausting the Germans and eventually contributed to checking their advance. Thus, neither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS-Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives for 12 July.\n\nWhile the battle is generally considered a tactical success for the German side due to the high numbers of Soviet tanks destroyed, in the wider perspective the Soviets successfully completed their defensive operation at Prokhorovka and created the conditions for their decisive counteroffensive, Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev, just as planned. Ultimately there was no German breakthrough at Prokhorovka or elsewhere in the Kursk salient, becoming the first time in the Second World War that a major German offensive was halted before it could break through enemy defences and penetrate into their operational or strategic depths. With the end of Operation Citadel, the strategic initiative permanently swung over to the Soviet Union for the rest of the war.\n\nThe battle has been widely described as the largest tank engagement or battle in military history, involving 1,200–1,500 tanks and sometimes up to 2,000, but this is incorrect as the battle did not involve that many tanks. The exaggerated figures originated from erroneous Soviet intelligence estimates of German armour reported during and after the battle, and subsequent postwar accounts that repeated this erroneous narrative. Some Soviet estimates reported figures as high as 800 German tanks and assault guns attacking Prokhorovka on 12 July.\n\nComparing Soviet and German archives, the total number of tanks and other heavy armoured fighting vehicles such as assault guns and self-propelled guns deployed by the 5th Guards Tank Army and the II SS-Panzer Corps around Prokhorovka during the battle numbered only about 910. The II SS-Panzer Corps never had the number of tanks and assault guns attributed to it by Soviet estimates at any point during Operation Citadel, not even at the start when it fielded only 494. Even if the definition of the battle was broadened to include the III Panzer Corps and the portion of the 5th Guards Tank Army that faced it, the total number of tanks and other heavy armoured fighting vehicles comes out at a maximum of 1,299. In contrast, for example, the Battle of Brody during Operation Barbarossa involved over 2,000 tanks, up to 6,000 tanks over the duration of the battle, engaged in combat over a 70-kilometre front. Nonetheless, the Battle of Prokhorovka is still regarded as one of the largest tank battles in military history.\n\nHigh figures for tanks lost during the battle have been widely attributed to the Germans, but these are incorrect. For example, Rotmistrov in his postwar accounts of the battle stated that the Germans lost 350–400 tanks, including 70 Tigers, and 3,500–10,000 soldiers on 12 July, and a Soviet General Staff study of the Battle of Kursk reported that the Germans lost 300 tanks, 20 assault guns and over 4,500 soldiers in the battle from 12 to 16 July inclusive. However, archival data of the German units involved show that much lower losses were incurred during the battle.\n\nThe historians David Glantz and Jonathan House asserted that the original intention of the 4th Panzer Army command was to drive northwards, with its two panzer corps driving abreast, toward Oboyan and then Kursk; but that on 9 July, due to heavy Soviet resistance along the road to Oboyan, Hoth was forced to disastrously alter his plan by ordering the II SS-Panzer Corps to swing from the northwesterly direction to the northeast toward Prokhorovka. Therefore, according to Glantz and House, the Battle of Prokhorova was not a result of original intention nor planned for, but was rather engendered by tactically flawed, late improvisations to the original German plan.\n\nThis narrative has been disputed by the historian Steven Newton, who dedicated a section of his 2002 publication about Operation Citadel to refuting it. Using first-hand accounts of German officers that executed Operation Citadel and scrutinizing Glantz' and House's sources, Newton contended that the plan for the 4th Panzer Army to swing from the Oboyan direction to Prokhorovka was decided as early as May 1943, well before Operation Citadel even commenced, as German planners of Army Group South had always expected an encounter between the 4th Panzer Army and Soviet reserves that would arrive at the Psel River and Prokhorovka. Other historians have corroborated these conclusions. Newton also asserts that this has always been the accepted narrative in post-war literature.\n\nSome historians state that the German troops did not expect the Soviet armoured counterattack and were taken by surprise on 12 July. However other historians have stated or argued that the German commanders were aware of, or at least anticipated, the Soviet armour that was massing around Prokhorovka, and therefore the troops could not have been genuinely surprised. The German historian Dieter Brand argues that even though the German commanders expected a major Soviet armoured deployment at Prokhorovka, the frontline German troops were indeed largely taken by surprise when the Soviets counterattacked on the morning of 12 July.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2192477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192477", "title": "Leucopogon", "text": "Leucopogon\n\nLeucopogon is a genus of about 150-160 species of shrubs or small trees in the family Ericaceae, in the section of that family formerly treated as the separate family Epacridaceae. They are native to Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, the western Pacific Islands and Malaysia, with the greatest species diversity in southeastern Australia. Plants in this genus have leaves with a few more or less parallel veins, and tube-shaped flowers usually with a white beard inside.\n\nPlants in the genus \"Leucopogon\" range from prostrate shrubs to small trees. The leaves are arranged alternately and usually have about three, more or less parallel veins visible on the lower surface. The flowers are arranged in leaf axils or on the ends of branchlets either singly or in spikes of a few to many flowers. There is a single egg-shaped to circular bract and a pair of similar bracteoles at the base of each flower immediately below the five sepals. The sepals are similar to the bracts but larger. The petals are fused to form a tube with the five petal tips rolled back or spreading, usually with a beard of white hairs inside. The stamens are attached to the tube near its tip and have a short filament and the tip of the style is thin. The fruit is a drupe.\n\nThe genus \"Leucopogon\" was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown in his \"Prodromus\".\n\nIn 2005, following cladistic analysis, in a paper published in \"Australian Systematic Botany\", Christopher John Quinn and others transferred some species previously known as species of \"Leucopogon\" to other genera, including \"Androstoma\" \", \"Acrotriche\" \", \"Acrothamnus\" and \"Agiortia\" . These species include the former \"L. colensoi\", \"L. milliganii\", \"L. maccraei\", \"L. montanus\". These, and other changes proposed have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census (\"APC\") but not the change of \"L. melaleucoides\" to \"Acrothamnus melaleucoides\".\n\nFurther molecular phylogenetic analysis of \"Styphelia\" and related genera by Crayn and others in 2018 have led to further proposed changes, not yet assessed by the APC as at April 2020.

Stephen Marston, minister of a baptist congregation.\nIn 1834, he was apprenticed to his maternal uncle, a London solicitor; but although he was not inattentive to the duties of the office, after obtained a fair knowledge of law, literature and the theatre had much greater attractions for him. \nHis evenings were devoted to the theatre, and becoming acquainted with Heraud, Francis Barham, and other members of the group which gathered around James Pierrepont Greaves.\nHe contributed to Heraud's magazine \"The Sunbeam,\" and himself became editor of a mystical periodical entitled \"The Psyche.\" \nAmong its chief supporters were some wealthy ladies near Cheltenham, Through them he made the acquaintance of Eleanor Jane Potts, eldest daughter of the proprietor of \"Saunders's News Letter,\" who had retired to Cheltenham. \nShe was not, as has been stated, a member of the Earl of Mayo's family. \nA warm and durable attachment on both sides was the consequence, which resulted in marriage in May 1840, notwithstanding the strongest opposition on the part of the lady's family. \nMarston idealised and inverted his love story in his first play, the \"Patrician's Daughter\" (1841, 8vo), performed in December 1842. \nMarston had already produced a little volume entitled \"Gerald, a Dramatic Poem, and other Poems\" (1842, 12mo), respectable, like everything he wrote.\nBulwer and Knowles had ceased to write, and for many years Marston was almost the only acted dramatist who wrought with any elevation of purpose. \n\"The Heart and the World\" (1847) was a failure, but in 1849 Marston, laying his theories aside for a time, appeared with an historical drama, \"Strathmore,\" which obtained great success, and which he himself regarded as his best work. \nIt has fine literary qualities, although the author's inability to think himself into the age he exhibits constitutes a grave defect. \nThe same may be said of Philip of France and \"Marie de Meranie\" (1850), 'a stirring tragedy, of which the verse has an appropriate martial ring,' and in which Helen Faucit produced a great impression. \nIt is based to some extent on G. P. R. James's novel \"Philip Augustus.\" \nIn the interim (1862) had appeared \"Anne Blake,\" another domestic drama, clever, but marred by such situations and denouements as only occur on the stage. \nIn \"A Life's Hansom\" (1857) the domestic and historical elements are in some measure blended, the action being laid at the revolution of 1688. \nSuch a piece might be easily produced by a man of Mareton's literary ability, but his next tragi-comedy, \"A Hard Struggle\" (1858), required genuine feeling in the author and great command over the resources of the stage. \nBeing written in prose, it produces a greater impression of reality than his more ambitious efforts; it drew tears and enthusiastic praise from Dickens, and obtained a greater success than any of his pieces, owing in part to the powerful acting of Dillon.\nAfter his marriage, Marston lived entirely in London, except for occasional visits to France and short lecturing tours in Scotland and Lancashire. \nHe had become well known in London literary society, especially to Dickens and his circle, and had taken a part in Bulwer's comedy of \"Not so bad as we seem,\" acted for the benefit of the Guild of Literature and Art. \nAbout the same time a tragedy on the history of Montezuma, which would have afforded ample scope for scenic display, was written for and purchased by Charles Kean, but never produced. \nIn 1837, Marston undertook the editorship of the \"National Magazine\" in conjunction with John Saunders. The early numbers had excellent contributions from Sydney Dobell, Mrs. Crowe, and other writers of mark, and illustrations after young artists of genius like Arthur Hughes and W. L. Windus, and with adequate capital the enterprise would probably have succeeded. \nRelinquishing it, and also renouncing vain attempts in fiction, for which, strangely enough, he did not appear to possess the slightest qualification, Marston returned to the theatre, and produced successively \"The Wife's Portrait\" (1862) and \"Pure Gold\" (1863), prose dramas of little account; \"Donna Diana\" (1863), the best of all his plays, but mainly taken from Moreto's masterpiece, \"El Desden con el Desden;\" and \"The Favourite of Fortune\" (1866). \nIt achieved a conspicuous success upon its production. \nThe same remark applies to \"A Hero of Romance,\" adapted from Octave Feuillet in 1867, and \"Life for Life\" (1869), written for Miss Neilson. \"Broken Spells\" followed in 1873, but with his last play, \"Under Fire\" (1885), he experienced a mortifying failure. \nThe piece was the weakest he ever wrote, and he had entirely lost touch with the time.\nFrom about 1863, Marston contributed much poetical criticism to the \"Athenæum.\" \nThe celebrated review of \"Atalanta in Calydon\" was written by him. \nCriticism, indeed, seemed rather his forte than original composition. His theoretical knowledge of the histrionic art was also profound; but though he showed little disposition to cultivate it practically, he was an excellent mimic, and Miss Neilson, like many other actors and actresses, owed much to his tuition. \nNo one judged an actor more accurately, and the admonitions of few were more valuable. He proved his power as a critic of acting in his \"Our Recent Actors: Recollect ions of late distinguished Performers of both Sexes,\" 1888.\nFrom 1860 to about 1874, Marston's circumstances were prosperous, and his house near the Regent's Park was a favourite meeting-place for poets, actors, and literary men. \nThe latter years of his life were clouded by calamity, especially the successive deaths of his wife in 1870, of his two daughters, Eleanor, wife of Arthur O'Shaughnessy, in February 1879, and Cicely in July 1878, and of his gifted and only son, Philip Bourke Marston. \nHis circumstances also became much impaired; but his friend Mr. Henry Irving generously organised (1 June 1887) a special performance of \"Werner\" for his benefit at the Lyceum Theatre. \nThe full receipts, amounting to £928 16\"s\"., were paid to Marston; all the expenses being borne by Mr. Irving. \nMarston died at his lodgings in the Euston Road, 5 January 1890, after a long illness, and was interred with his wife and children in Highgate cemetery. \n\n"}
{"id": "2192486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192486", "title": "Lydden Hill Race Circuit", "text": "Lydden Hill Race Circuit\n\nLydden Hill Race Circuit (formerly known as Lydden Circuit) is a motorsport venue in Denton with Wootton, about half-way between Canterbury and Dover in Kent, England. The mile-long circuit is mainly used for Rallycross, Drift, Saloon and Sports car racing as well as Motorcycle racing.\n\nIt is the shortest road racing circuit in the United Kingdom. The track, previously owned by the McLaren Group, has undergone changes to make it the hub of Kentish motorsport. The track is one of two motor racing circuits in the county of Kent, along with Brands Hatch.\n\nLydden was founded in 1955 by Bill Chesson with the help of the Astra Motor Club. From 1957, they promoted stock-car racing and grass-track racing for motorcycles – the land on which this took place was owned by Barry Skinner, who sold it to Chesson. By 1962, Chesson wanted to progress and laid a tarmac track in order to promote motor and motorcycle road racing. The original plan was for a 1-mile circuit but this scheme had to be put on hold when the tarmac ran out at what is known as the Devil’s Elbow; the result was the short circuit, which is sometimes used by Legends and Hot Rods.\n\nIn 1965, tarmac asphalt was laid for hosting car racing up to Formula Three. Lydden became extremely popular, to the point that, in 1967, a meeting featuring Formula Three was televised and included up and coming drivers such as Andy Sutcliffe, Roger Williamson and Tom Walkinshaw.\n\nOn 4 February 1967, the sport of Rallycross was born at Lydden, thought up by TV producer Robert Reed (for ITV) and race organiser Bud Smith (750 Motor Club – Tunbridge Wells Centre) in co-operation with Chesson. Combining tarmac and non-tarmac elements, the inaugural race was won by Vic Elford in a Porsche 911. Since 1973, Lydden Circuit has seen rounds of Embassy/ERA European Rallycross Championships and FIA European Championships for Rallycross Drivers, the first 23 (till 1996) all organised by the Thames Estuary Automobile Club (TEAC). To this day, Lydden, as the so-called \"Home of Rallycross\", still holds British Rallycross Championship racing, especially with its popular Easter Monday meeting.\n\nOn 9 September 1968, then-unknown English driver James Hunt recorded his first race win driving a Russell-Alexis Mk14 Formula Ford car. Hunt would return on 5 May 1969, this time driving a Motor Racing Enterprises entered Merlyn Mk11A, and recorded his second ever win.\n\nBy 1986, the RAC MSA was pressurising Bill Chesson to erect Armco barriers, but he steadfastly refused to do so, on the grounds that they would be dangerous to the motorcycle-racing fraternity. When RAC MAS threatened to refuse him a new circuit permit, and fearing that his two sons, well known at Lydden as successful racers, would fall out running the track once Bill died, he put it up for sale. Tom Bissett bought the circuit for the asking price of well over a million pounds.\nIn March 1991, Mr and Mrs Bissett entered into a joint venture with McLaren. McLaren then subsequently acquired the Bissett’s shares in Lydden and became sole owners, McLaren then entered plans for industrial buildings and for the track itself to be extended. If the planning permission would have been granted to McLaren, The McLaren technology complex wouldn’t have been built at Woking, it would have been at Lydden Hill, The plans were to build on the land adjacent to the paddock area. There may have also been circuit extensions and other test facilities built on that area of the site (if all the planning permits had been granted the McLaren F1 would have been built there, the F1 team would have been based there, and the McLaren road cars, could have quite well have been built there too). While all the applications were being considered. They bought the track and leased it to the British Motorcycle Racing Club (BMCRC) from 1993 on, thus allowing both cars and bikes to have full use of the track. BMCRC were based at Lydden until the end of 2007, and it formed their home track, playing host to the annual 'Lord of Lydden' and 'Sidecar burnup' races, together with a number of club motorcycle race meetings. Another piece in the history of Lydden came in 2003, when McLaren had an application turned down for Lydden to become a private testing venue.\n\nFrom 2008 on, the new lease holder of the circuit will be, for at least five years, the Waste Recycling Consultant, MSA British Rallycross Champion (2002, 2005, 2009, 2010) and FIA European Rallycross Championship runner-up (1992) Pat Doran. Doran, from Thorverton in Devon, is planning several improvements for the venue as well as an extension of the racing programme (for cars and bikes alike) and his daughter, Amy Doran, has been appointed as director for day-to-day running of the circuit.\n\nOn 24–25 May 2014, Lydden Hill played host to the newly formed FIA World Rallycross Championship. The event was run under similar principles to the FIA European Rallycross Championship in the previous few years, but with the likes of Petter Solberg and Liam Doran being notable drivers competing in the championship, as well as Andrew Jordan and Tanner Foust as the famous \"wildcard\" entries, record crowds were predicted for the weekend at the end of May.\n\nThe opening round of the 2009 FIA European Rallycross Championship (ERC) brought top flight Rallycross back to Lydden Hill. The last European Rallycross event at Lydden Hill Race Circuit was hosted in 1996. As all kind of things can change over a period of 12 years time, at least one thing didn't change ... After being declared winner of the 1996 European event at Lydden in the main Division, multiple champion Kenneth Hansen (Citroën C4) cruised to victory again in Division 1 on Easter Monday (13 April).\n\nWhen ERC returned at the end of May 2010, Norwegian Sverre Isachsen (Ford Focus ST), celebrated his first victory in the European Championship as he beat multiple champion Kenneth Hansen (Citroën C4) and local guy Liam Doran (Citroën C4) in the Division 1 'A' final.\n\nAbout 13,500 people spent Easter 2011 at Wootton, attending the opening round of the 2011 ERC. Specially for the Norwegian fans among them it was a great weekend as the victories in all of the three racing categories went to Norway. Sverre Isachsen (Ford Focus Mk2) was on the highest step of the SuperCars podium on Monday afternoon. Before already Andreas Bakkerud (Renault Clio Mk2) and Lars Øivind Enerberg (Ford Fiesta ST RWD) did the same in the Super1600 and Touring Cars classes.\n\nThere were no first qualifying heats on day 1 of the opening round of the 2012 ERC as problems with the start systems made the Clerk of the Course decide to run the first heat on Monday. Therefore, the 2012 championship started in a similar way as previous year's championship ended when at Sosnová in the Czech Republic during the final round the first heats also had to be postponed until the other day. With the absence of defending champion Sverre Isachsen the door is now open for last year's runner-up Tanner Foust (Ford Fiesta Mk7) to start the season with a victory.\n\nThe opening round of the 2013 FIA European Rallycross Championship was held over the Easter holiday, at Lydden Hill, with victory going to the American Tanner Foust in his Ford Fiesta for the second year running, only after reigning ERC champion Timur Timerzyanov for dropped back with a punctured tyre.\n\nIn 2014, the FIA World Rallycross Championship arrived in Kent for Round Two. Ford Olsbergs MSE driver Andreas Bakkerud won, after a near perfect run. Robin Larsson claimed the runner’s-up spot in his Audi A1 Supercar, with Britain’s Andrew Jordan ending the event third in front of his home crowd.\n\n\n\n\n+ ran in conjunction with the British Rallycross Grand Prix\n\n"}

{"id": "2192496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192496", "title": "Fungiculture", "text": "Fungiculture\n\nFungiculture is the cultivation of mushrooms and other fungi. By growing fungi, food, medicine, construction materials and other products can be attained. A \"mushroom farm\" is in the business of growing fungi.\n\nThe word is also commonly used to refer to the practice of cultivating fungi by leafcutter ants, termites, ambrosia beetles, and marsh periwinkles.\n\nMushrooms are not plants, and require different conditions for optimal growth. Plants develop through photosynthesis, a process that converts atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, especially cellulose. While sunlight provides an energy source for plants, mushrooms derive all of their energy and growth materials from their growth medium, through biochemical decomposition processes. This does not mean that light is an irrelevant requirement, since some fungi use light as a signal for fruiting. However, all the materials for growth must already be present in the growth medium. Mushrooms grow well at relative humidity levels of around 95–100%, and substrate moisture levels of 50 to 75%.\n\nInstead of seeds, mushrooms reproduce asexually through spores. Spores can be contaminated with airborne microorganisms, which will interfere with mushroom growth and prevent a healthy crop.\n\nMycelium, or actively growing mushroom culture, is placed on a substrate—usually sterilized grains such as rye or millet—and induced to grow into those grains. This is called inoculation. Inoculated grains (or plugs) are referred to as spawn. Spores are another inoculation option, but are less developed than established mycelium. Since they are also contaminated easily, they are only manipulated in laboratory conditions with a laminar flow cabinet.\n\nAll mushroom growing techniques require the correct combination of humidity, temperature, substrate (growth medium) and inoculum (spawn or starter culture). Wild harvests, outdoor log inoculation and indoor trays all provide these elements.\n\nMushrooms can be grown on logs placed outdoors in stacks or piles, as has been done for hundreds of years. Sterilization is not performed in this method. Since production may be unpredictable and seasonal, less than 5% of commercially sold mushrooms are produced this way. Here, tree logs are inoculated with spawn, then allowed to grow as they would in wild conditions. Fruiting, or pinning, is triggered by seasonal changes, or by briefly soaking the logs in cool water. Shiitake and oyster mushrooms have traditionally been produced using the outdoor log technique, although controlled techniques such as indoor tray growing or artificial logs made of compressed substrate have been substituted.\n\nShiitake mushrooms grown under a forested canopy are considered non-timber forest products In the Northeast shiitake mushrooms can be cultivated on a variety of hardwood logs including oak, American beech, sugar maple and hophornbeam. Softwood should not be used to cultivate shiitake mushrooms. The resin of softwoods will oftentimes inhibit the growth of the shiitake mushroom making it impractical as a growing substrate.\n\nIn order to produce shiitake mushrooms, 1 metre (3-foot) hardwood logs with a diameter ranging between are inoculated with the mycelium of the shiitake fungus. Inoculation is completed by drilling holes in hardwood logs, filling the holes with cultured shiitake mycelium or inoculum, and then sealing the filled holes with hot wax. After inoculation, the logs are placed under the closed canopy of a coniferous stand and are left to incubate for 12 to 15 months. Once incubation is complete, the logs are soaked in water for 24 hours. 7 to 10 days after soaking, shiitake mushrooms will begin to fruit and can be harvested once fully ripe.\n\nIndoor growing provides the ability to tightly regulate light, temperature and humidity while excluding contaminants and pests. This allows consistent production, regulated by spawning cycles. This is typically accomplished in windowless, purpose-built buildings, for large-scale commercial production.\n\nIndoor tray growing is the most common commercial technique, followed by containerized growing. The tray technique provides the advantages of scalability and easier harvesting. Unlike wild harvests, indoor techniques provide tight control over growing substrate composition and growing conditions. Indoor harvests are much more predictable.\n\nAccording to Daniel Royse and Robert Beelman, \"[Indoor] Mushroom farming consists of six steps, and although the divisions are somewhat arbitrary, these steps identify what is needed to form a production system. The six steps are phase I composting, phase II fertilizing, spawning, casing, pinning, and cropping.\"\n\nComplete sterilization is not always required or performed during composting. In some cases, a pasteurization step is not included to allow some beneficial microorganisms to remain in the growth substrate.\n\nSpecific time spans and temperatures required during stages 3–6 will vary respective to species and variety. Substrate composition and the geometry of growth substrate will also affect the ideal times and temperatures.\n\nPinning is the trickiest part for a mushroom grower, since a combination of carbon dioxide (CO) concentration, temperature, light, and humidity triggers mushrooms towards fruiting. Up until the point when rhizomorphs or mushroom \"pins\" appear, the mycelium is an amorphous mass spread throughout the growth substrate, unrecognizable as a mushroom.\n\nCarbon dioxide concentration becomes elevated during the vegetative growth phase, when mycelium is sealed in a gas-resistant plastic barrier or bag which traps gases produced by the growing mycelium. To induce pinning, this barrier is opened or ruptured. CO concentration then decreases from about 0.08% to 0.04%, the ambient atmospheric level.\n\nOyster mushroom farming is rapidly expanding around many parts of the world. Increased consciousness of its nutritional value and increased market demand is making mushroom cultivation one of the most sought businesses among the farming communities. Oyster mushroom is grown in substrate that comprises sterilized wheat or paddy straw and does not require much space compared to other crops. Its per unit production and profit extracted is comparatively higher than other crops.\n\nMushroom production converts the raw natural ingredients into mushroom tissue, most notably the carbohydrate chitin.\n\nAn ideal substrate will contain enough nitrogen and carbohydrate for rapid mushroom growth. Common bulk substrates include several of the following ingredients:\n\n\nMushrooms metabolize complex carbohydrates in their substrate into glucose, which is then transported through the mycelium as needed for growth and energy. While it is used as a main energy source, its concentration in the growth medium should not exceed 2%. For ideal fruiting, closer to 1% is ideal.\n\nOne of the most sustainable ways of mushroom cultivation is using coffee grounds as a substrate. This process was pioneered by Prof. Chang Shuting in the early 1990s while he worked at the Chinese University in Hong Kong. Coffee grounds are sterile, and rich in fibers. It is more environmentally-friendly; as an estimated millions of kilos of coffee waste disposed in landfill every day, which could be diverted into sustainable food production. The spent substrate, after harvesting mushrooms, is enriched in essential amino-acids, and therefore an ideal feed for animals.\n\nParasitic insects, bacteria and other fungi all pose risks to indoor production. The sciarid fly or phorid fly may lay eggs in the growth medium, which hatch into maggots and damage developing mushrooms during all growth stages. Bacterial blotch caused by \"Pseudomonas\" bacteria or patches of \"Trichoderma\" green mold also pose a risk during the fruiting stage. Pesticides and sanitizing agents are available to use against these infestations. Biological controls for insect sciarid and phorid flies have also been proposed.\n\nAn epidemic of Trichoderma green mold significantly affected mushroom production: \"From 1994–96, crop losses in Pennsylvania ranged from 30 to 100%\".\n\n\n\nPennsylvania is the top-producing mushroom state in the United States, and celebrates September as \"Mushroom Month\".\n\nThe borough of Kennett Square is a historical and present leader in mushroom production. It currently leads production\nof Agaricus-type mushrooms, followed by California, Florida and Michigan.\n\nOther mushroom-producing states:\n\n\nVancouver, British Columbia has a significant number of producersabout 60 as of 1998mostly located in the lower Fraser Valley.\n\nOyster mushroom cultivation has taken off in Europe as of late. Many entrepreneurs nowadays find it as a quite profitable business, a start-up with a small investment and good profit. Italy with 785,000 tonnes and Netherlands with 307,000 tonnes are between the top ten mushroom producing countries in the world. The world's biggest producer of mushroom spawn is also situated in France.\n\nAccording to a research carried out on Production and Marketing of Mushrooms: Global and National Scenario Poland, Netherlands, Belgium, Lithuania are the major exporting mushrooms countries in Europe and countries like UK, Germany, France, Russia are considered to be the major importing countries.\n\nOyster mushroom cultivation is a sustainable business where different natural resources can be used as a substrate. The number of people becoming interested in this field is rapidly increasing. The possibility of creating a viable business in urban environments by using coffee grounds is appealing for many entrepreneurs.\n\nSince mushroom cultivation is not a subject available at school, most urban farmers learned it by doing. The time to master mushroom cultivation is time consuming and costly in missed revenue. For this reason there are numerous companies in Europe specialized in mushroom cultivation that are offering training for entrepreneurs and organizing events to build community and share knowledge. They also show the potential positive impact of this business on the environment.\n\nCourses about mushroom cultivation can be attended in many countries around Europe. There is education available for growing mushrooms on coffee grounds, more advanced training for larger scale farming, spawn production and lab work and growing facilities.\n\nEvents are organised with different intervals. The Mushroom Learning Network gathers once a year in Europe. The International Society for Mushroom Science gathers once every five-years somewhere in the world.\n"}

He was the first draft selection in the 2000 AFL draft. He was the captain of St Kilda in 2005 and from 2007 to 2016. Riewoldt holds the all-time record for most marks in VFL/AFL history, surpassing Gary Dempsey in Round 15, 2017. His cousin Jack Riewoldt plays for Richmond.\n\nBorn in Hobart, Tasmania, Riewoldt and his family moved to the Gold Coast, Queensland, when he was 9 years old. He attended Robina State Primary School from Grade 5 and became the school's vice captain and UNICEF representative. He later switched to All Saints Anglican School during his high school years. Australian rules football was not offered in many Queensland schools at the time but he made a name for himself as an overall sportsman, participating in the school's athletics, cross country, cricket, soccer and touch football teams at a high level. Academically, he also excelled in the studies of physics and chemistry.\n\nRiewoldt played his junior and early senior football for the Broadbeach Cats before moving to the Southport Sharks where he was identified as an outstanding junior talent. He played a big part in Southport's historic fourth consecutive QAFL premiership in 2000. After being kept virtually touchless for the first half, he was moved into the ruck and kicked two important goals in the 11-point grand final victory.\n\nGrowing up, Riewoldt supported the Hawthorn Football Club. He is the first cousin of footballer Jack Riewoldt, who also plays as a forward.\n\nRiewoldt was the No. 1 Draft Pick in the 2000 AFL Draft and made his debut in 2001.\n\nHis breakout season was 2004 when he took an AFL record 256 marks and also finished in the top ten for both the Coleman and Brownlow medals. He received the AFL Players Association Most Valuable Player Award, the Leigh Matthews Trophy and was selected in the 2004 All-Australian Team for the first time.\n\nRiewoldt was rewarded for his 2004 efforts when St Kilda named him club captain for 2005 as part of their rotating captaincy policy. His 2005 season began badly as he broke his collarbone in the third quarter of the first game of the season against the Brisbane Lions. This drew controversy as he was then bumped after the injury by Lions players Chris Scott and Mal Michael. The pair were not asked to face the AFL tribunal on charges of misconduct for targeting an injured player as it was ruled that they would not have known that Riewoldt was injured, that Riewoldt had waved away a trainer that was attending to the injury and that the bumps did not contribute to the injury.\n\nEarly in the 2006 season, Riewoldt returned close to his best form, kicking five goals against former powerhouse Brisbane in Round 3. This match seemed to have put Riewoldt's kicking \"yips\" to bed, but they returned during the Round 7 match against Geelong when he missed a simple but critical goal from 15 metres out. This miss was forgotten the next week when Riewoldt kicked 9 goals against Carlton and took many contested marks. Riewoldt also took a match saving mark for the Saints against Sydney in Round 11, a match the Saints won in wet conditions, and one that kept their finals hopes alive.\n\nRiewoldt topped off the 2006 season by winning his third Trevor Barker Award. In achieving this feat, Riewoldt has already emulated some of the Saints greatest players such as the 1966 premiership captain Darrel Baldock, former skipper Nathan Burke and past champions Wells Eicke, Jack Davis and Jim Ross. Riewoldt was recognised for his season with selection in the 2006 All-Australian Team as a forward player, his second career All-Australian Team award.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2007 season, Lyon appointed Riewoldt Co-Captain of the St Kilda Football Club, along with Luke Ball and Lenny Hayes, both former captains themselves. Back and hamstring injuries forced Riewoldt to miss the first three matches of the season. Riewoldt started the season well, with eight goals in his first two matches. In Round 7, Riewoldt dominated against the Sydney Swans, which kick started another outstanding year. Despite the Saints missing the finals, Riewoldt enjoyed a better year statistically than 2004, narrowly winning St Kilda's best and fairest Trevor Barker Award ahead of defender Sam Fisher.\n\nRiewoldt played in St Kilda's 2008 NAB Cup winning side – the club's third pre-season cup win. Riewoldt had a consistent 2008 season, coming second in the AFL for marks (behind Matthew Richardson) and kicking 57 home and away season goals (63 all up) to finish ninth in the competition. This performance earned him his third All-Australian selection, his first at centre-half-forward. He was also selected to play in the Hall of Fame Tribute Match, but was ultimately unable to play due to a knee injury. Riewoldt was recognised for his season with selection in the 2008 All-Australian Team as a forward player. This was his third All-Australian Team award.\n\nEarly in the season Riewoldt became a target for the fledgling Gold Coast Football Club, which was awarded the 17th licence to enter the AFL in 2011. However, he knocked back their offer to remain at St Kilda.\n\nRiewoldt took the most marks of any player in the league, averaging 9.7 a game and kicking 65 goals in the home and away season, averaging 3.3 a game.\n\nHe was a significant player in a St Kilda team which went through the home and away season with 20 wins and 2 defeats.\n\nRiewoldt played in 21 of 22 matches in the 2009 home and away rounds in which St Kilda qualified in first position for the finals series, winning the club's third minor premiership.\n\nRiewoldt was recognised for his season with selection in the 2009 All-Australian Team as a forward player. He was also named captain of the 2009 All-Australian Team, his fourth All-Australian Team award.\n\nIn the preliminary final against the Western Bulldogs, Riewoldt kicked four goals, one of which was in the final minutes..\n\nSt Kilda qualified for the 2009 AFL Grand Final after qualification and preliminary finals wins but were defeated by Geelong by 12 points. Riewoldt kicked one goal.\n\nRiewoldt won the 2009 Trevor Barker Award for St Kilda's best and fairest player, setting a new club record of five career best and fairest awards. He was also St Kilda's leading goal kicker in 2009.\n\nDuring St Kilda's 28-point Round 3 win over Collingwood, on 9 April 2010, Riewoldt experienced a high grade hamstring tear. He underwent surgery and made his return in Round 15, playing 15 games in the season for 39 goals.\n\nOn 1 September 2016, at the Saints' best-and-fairest awards night, Riewoldt announced that he would stand down as St Kilda captain.\n\nOn 31 July 2017, Riewoldt announced that he would retire at the end of the season. He played the final game of his career in round 23 when he had 15 disposals, 8 marks and 1 goal in a loss to the Richmond Tigers, his cousin's team.\n\nOn 20 December 2010 a photo with a nude image of Riewoldt was posted on the social networking site Facebook by a 17-year-old girl. The girl, whose name was initially withheld in the media due to her age, stated that her actions were a result of unfair treatment at the hands of the AFL regarding an incident earlier in the year, in which she claimed she had become pregnant as a result of having sex with two St Kilda players following a school football clinic. Another nude photo, of fellow Saints player Nick Dal Santo, was also posted. In a subsequent press conference Riewoldt claimed to have never met the girl and that the photo had been taken over a year prior, during an end-of-season trip, in Miami, Florida, by teammate Sam Gilbert, and that he had asked Gilbert to immediately delete the photo. Gilbert stated that the photos had been stolen from his own personal computer, describing the incident as a \"significant breach of privacy without my knowledge or consent\". The girl disputed Gilbert's statement, saying that she had taken the photos and was in possession of at least 19 more images of other AFL players. The girl later admitted this to be a lie, stating that she fabricated this claim of ownership so as not to get into any trouble. She then claimed to have been sent the photos by an unnamed St Kilda player in April of that year. On 24 December 2010 a Federal Court granted a permanent injunction on the images, supporting Riewoldt and Gilbert's statement that the photos had been stolen from Gilbert's laptop computer without consent. Justice Shane Marshall ordered the images and any others be deleted from the girl's computer, with mediation between her and the St Kilda Football Club scheduled to take place on 28 January 2011.\n\nRiewoldt is married to Catherine Heard. The pair married in October 2012 at her parents' property in Waco, Texas, United States. They have three sons, James (born in 2014), William (born in 2016), and Edward \"Teddy\" (born 2019). His sister Madeleine died of aplastic anaemia, a rare bone marrow condition, in February 2015 at the age of 26. Riewoldt and his family established Maddie's Riewoldt's Vision to raise funds for research into new treatments for blood cancers.\n\nRiewoldt's player profile at AFL Tables:\n\n\"*10 games required to be eligible.\"\n\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2001\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2002\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2003\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2004\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2005\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2006\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2007\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2008\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2009\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2010\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2011\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2012\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2013\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2014\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2015\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2016\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2017\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 336\n! 718\n! 455\n! 4051\n! 1562\n! 5613\n! 2944\n! 518\n! 2.1\n! 1.4\n! 12.1\n! 4.6\n! 16.7\n! 8.8\n! 1.5\n\nTeam\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

It is a coarse-grained rock consisting of 40 to 90% olivine along with significant orthopyroxene and lesser amounts of calcic chromium-rich clinopyroxene. Minor minerals include chromium and aluminium spinels and garnets. Plagioclase can occur in lherzolites and other peridotites that crystallize at relatively shallow depths (20 – 30 km). At greater depth plagioclase is unstable and is replaced by spinel. At approximately 90 km depth, pyrope garnet becomes the stable aluminous phase. Garnet lherzolite is a major constituent of the Earth's upper mantle (extending to ~300 km depth). Lherzolite is known from the lower ultramafic part of ophiolite complexes (although harzburgite is more common in this setting), from alpine-type peridotite massifs, from fracture zones adjacent to mid-oceanic ridges, and as xenoliths in kimberlite pipes and alkali basalts. Partial melting of spinel lherzolite is one of the primary sources of basaltic magma.\n\nThe name is derived from its type locality, the Lherz Massif (an alpine peridotite complex, also known as orogenic lherzolite complex), at Étang de Lers, near Massat in the French Pyrenees; Étang de Lherz is the archaic spelling of this location.\n\nThe Lherz massif also contains harzburgite and dunite, as well as layers of spinel pyroxenite, garnet pyroxenite, and hornblendite. The layers represent partial melts extracted from the host peridotite during decompression in the mantle long before emplacement into the crust.\n\nThe Lherz massif is unique because it has been emplaced into Paleozoic carbonates (limestones and dolomites), which form mixed breccias of limestone-lherzolite around the margins of the massif.\n\nThe Moon’s lower mantle may be composed of lherzolite.\n\n"}
{"id": "2192512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192512", "title": "Jeremy Strohmeyer", "text": "Jeremy Strohmeyer\n\nJeremy Strohmeyer (born October 11, 1978) is a convicted murderer, serving four consecutive life terms for the sexual assault and murder of 7-year-old Sherrice Iverson (October 20, 1989 – May 25, 1997) at Primadonna Resort and Casino in Primm, Nevada, on May 25, 1997.\n\nThe case drew national attention by focusing on the safety of children in casinos and on the revelation that Strohmeyer's friend, David Cash Jr., said he saw the crime in progress but did not stop it.\n\nIn the early morning hours of May 25, 1997, two males, Jeremy Strohmeyer (age 18) and David Cash Jr. (age 17), were at the Primadonna Resort & Casino at Primm, Nevada, near the California state line. The two young men had arrived at the gambling establishment, accompanied by Cash's father, from their homes in Long Beach. Strohmeyer was a student at Wilson High School in Long Beach.\n\nAt around 4 a.m., Strohmeyer began repeatedly making apparently \"playful\" contact with 7-year-old Sherrice Iverson, who was roaming the casino alone. The young girl's father was gambling and drinking. Her father left Sherrice in the care of her 14-year-old brother, Harold, in the casino's arcade. This resulted in Sherrice running around unmonitored. The girl had been returned to her father several times through the day, having been found alone by security. Eventually, Strohmeyer followed Sherrice into a women's restroom.\n\nWhile in the restroom, the two began throwing wet paper wads at one another. Sherrice then reportedly tossed a yellow plastic \"Wet Floor\" sign at Strohmeyer. At around this time Strohmeyer's friend, David Cash, entered the restroom and witnessed Strohmeyer forcibly taking Iverson into a stall. When Cash looked in from the adjacent stall, he saw Strohmeyer holding his left hand over Iverson's mouth and fondling her with his right. After this, Cash left the restroom and was followed 20 minutes later by Strohmeyer, who immediately confessed to him that he had molested and killed the girl.\n\nThree days later, Strohmeyer was taken into custody at his home. Two classmates in Long Beach had identified him after security tape footage captured by cameras at the casino was released by Nevada police and played on the television news. Strohmeyer was charged with first-degree murder, first-degree kidnapping, and sexual assault of a minor. When questioned by police, Strohmeyer stated that he molested Iverson and strangled her to stifle her screams. Before leaving, Strohmeyer noticed Iverson was still alive and twisted her head in an attempt to break her neck, and after hearing a loud popping sound, rested her body in a sitting position on the toilet with her feet in the bowl. Strohmeyer's attorneys later tried to have the confession suppressed because he was not given legal counsel. However, the police claimed that Strohmeyer waived his right to have an attorney present during questioning.\nStrohmeyer's defense attorney was Leslie Abramson, who represented many high-profile clients, including the Menendez brothers. Strohmeyer claimed he was high on alcohol and drugs at the time and did not remember committing the crimes. It was even suggested that perhaps the witness, David Cash, had, in fact, been the one to murder Sherrice, as Strohmeyer claimed to have no recollection of his actions and the witness was the one to actually tell him what he had seen him doing in the bathroom that night. Abramson also noted that Strohmeyer's biological father is in prison and his biological mother is in a mental hospital.\n\nStrohmeyer's trial was scheduled to begin in September 1998. Prosecutors claimed that Strohmeyer had asked his former girlfriend to dress up as a school girl for him.\n\nStrohmeyer was originally facing a possible death sentence for the murder (had the case gone to trial), but hours before his trial was to start, Abramson entered a plea bargain on his behalf. On September 8, 1998, Strohmeyer pleaded guilty to four charges: first-degree murder, first-degree kidnapping, sexual assault on a minor with substantial bodily harm and sexual assault on a minor. On October 14, 1998, he was sentenced to four life terms, one for each crime he pleaded guilty to, to be served consecutively without possibility of parole.\n\nStrohmeyer was initially incarcerated at Ely State Prison, a maximum security prison located north of Ely, Nevada where most prisoners in Nevada who are serving life without parole are imprisoned for at least the early portion of their sentences. He was placed in administrative segregation, meaning that he was not placed in the general inmate population, but rather in his own cell in a special secured section. His prison number is #059389. Strohmeyer was reportedly transferred to the Lovelock Correctional Center in Lovelock, Nevada where he is classified as \"medium\" custody.\n\nJeremy Strohmeyer subsequently appealed his conviction.\n\nIn 2000, he was unsuccessfully defended by Camille Abate. Strohmeyer recanted his confession and accused Abramson of lying to him and bullying him into pleading guilty in order to cover up her misunderstandings about Nevada Law. Strohmeyer's new attorneys also suggested that Abramson wanted him to plead guilty because Strohmeyer's parents could not afford to pay her additional funds if the case went to trial. Abramson denied all the allegations. Ultimately, his appeal was rejected.\n\nIn 2001, the Nevada Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Strohmeyer to cancel his guilty plea. In January 2006, Strohmeyer lost a federal court bid to review his case.\n\nOn May 31, 2018, a request for parole was made based on 2012 and 2016 Supreme Court decisions that juveniles should have a chance at parole.\n\nHis request was denied in July 2018.\nIn October 1999, Strohmeyer's adoptive parents filed a $1 million lawsuit against Los Angeles County and its adoption workers. They claimed that social workers deliberately withheld crucial information that would have stopped them from adopting him as an infant. Specifically, they claimed they were never told that Strohmeyer's biological mother had severe mental problems, including that she suffered from chronic schizophrenia and had been hospitalized more than 60 times prior to Strohmeyer's birth.\n\nHowever, the Strohmeyers have stated that they will continue to support their adopted son despite the fact that he will almost certainly spend the rest of his life in prison.\n\nSherrice Iverson's mother demanded that David Cash Jr., also be charged as an accessory to murder, but authorities stated there was insufficient evidence connecting him to the actual crime, and Cash was never prosecuted for any offense related to the murder.\n\nIn the weeks following Strohmeyer's arrest, Cash told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that he did not dwell on the murder of Sherrice Iverson. \"I'm not going to get upset over somebody else's life. I just worry about myself first. I'm not going to lose sleep over somebody else's problems.\" He also told the newspaper that the publicity surrounding the case had made it easier for him to \"score with women.\" Cash also told the \"Long Beach Press-Telegram\": \"I'm no idiot ... I'll get my money out of this.\"\n\nCash would go on to face being labeled \"the bad Samaritan,\" and also the target of a campaign by students who attempted to get him kicked out of UC Berkeley for not stopping the crime. Two local Los Angeles radio hosts, Tim Conway Jr. and Doug Steckler, subsequently held a rally to have Cash expelled from the University of California at Berkeley, but University officials stated that they had no basis to remove him since he was not convicted of any crime.\n\nCash did express equivocal remorse over Iverson's death in a radio interview, stating that \"I have a lot of remorse toward the Iverson family. It was a very tragic event...The simple fact remains I don't know this little girl ... I don't know people in Panama or Africa who are killed every day, so I can't feel remorse for them. The only person I know is Jeremy Strohmeyer\", but still insisted that he did nothing wrong.\n\nSherrice Iverson's murder led to the passage of Nevada State Assembly Bill 267, requiring people to report to authorities when they have reasonable suspicions that a child younger than 18 is being sexually abused or violently treated. The impetus for the bill stemmed from Cash's inaction during the commission of the crime.\n\nThe \"Sherrice Iverson\" bill, introduced by Nevada State Assembly Majority Leader Richard Perkins (D-Henderson), provides for a fine and possible jail time for anyone who fails to report a crime of the nature that led to the creation of the bill. The bill was enacted in 2000.\n\nSherrice Iverson's murder also led to the passage of California Assembly Bill 1422, the \"Sherrice Iverson Child Victim Protection Act\", which added section 152.3 to California's Penal Code. This duty to rescue law requires that a person notify law enforcement if they witness a murder, rape, or any lewd or lascivious act, where the victim is under 14 years old.\n\nAs a result of this murder, hotels in Nevada increased security in their arcades, often having a security guard even in small arcades.\n\n\n"}

Like garrison, it comes from an Old French word of ultimately Germanic origin meaning to provide or defend.\n\nIn the later 1800s, garrets became one of the defining features of Second Empire architecture in Paris, France, where large buildings were stratified socially between different floors. As the number of stairs to climb increased, the social status decreased. Garrets were often internal elements of the mansard roof, with skylights or dormer windows.\n\nA \"bow garret\" is a two-story \"outhouse\" situated at the back of a typical terraced house often used in Lancashire for the hat industry in pre-mechanised days. \"Bowing\" was the name given to the technique of cleaning up animal (e.g. rabbit) fur in the early stages of preparation for turning it into hats. What is now believed to be the last bow garret in existence (in Denton, Greater Manchester) is now a listed building in order to preserve this historical relic.\n\n"}

Originally a maker of farm machinery, Glas evolved first into a producer of motor scooters, then automobiles. It was purchased by BMW in 1966, \nmainly to gain access to Glas's patents; they were the first to use a timing belt with an overhead camshaft in an automotive application. Its limited model range was shortly phased out by its new parent.\n\nMechanic Andreas Glas (born 1857, son of Maurus who founded in 1860 in Freising the first agricultural machines factory of Bavaria) founded an own repair company for agricultural machines at 1883 in Pilsting. He named the company \"Andreas Glas, Reparaturwerkstätte für landwirtschaftliche Maschinen mit Dampfbetrieb\" (in English: Andreas Glas, repair-shop for steam-powered agricultural machines). During the summer periods about 16 people worked for him. In 1905 Andreas Glas' company built their first crop sowing machines (seed drill). He then had sufficient work to employ all his employees during the winters. The production of sowing machines rose from year to year:\n\n1906 the Andreas Glas partened with a financer becoming Glas & Lohn and changed it brand name from Bavaria to Isaria; the partnership ended 1911. \n1908 Glas production moved to Dingolfing to overcome the mandatory rule which was forbidding not local factories to participate to the important local agricultural machine exposition. The new factory started with 150 sowing machines per year. The production count rose each year.\n1920 Glas Werke AG became a share company partnering with Stumm Group.\n1924 Hans Glas (1890-†1969) became CEO of Glas Werke AG.\n1931 failure of the Stumm Group.\n1933 Hans Glass boughs Glas Werke by the shareholders\n\nAfter World War II, the market for sowing machines was declining, and the company began building little carrows and later working machines for bakers along with sowing machines.\n1949 Glas Werke becomes a family company renamed Hans Glas GmbH (Ltd) involving son Andreas (1923-†1990) and daughter Hertha\n\nGlas were known for small cars like the Goggomobil. However, in 1964 the company introduced the Glas 1300GT coupe and later the 1700GT. The body was designed by Pietro Frua. However competition, mostly from British cars, was tough and in 1966 they released the 2600GT powered by a SOHC V8 engine, with a volume just under 2.6 litres. However this didn't help and later the same year the company was sold to BMW. The Glas models were kept in production by BMW, but fitted with BMW engines. The Glas 1300 GT coupe was fitted with a 1.6-litre BMW engine and renamed BMW 1600 GT. BMW also fitted a 3-litre engine and named it 3000 GT. This model kept the Glas name, but had a BMW logo in the front and rear. In 1968 BMW created their own large coupe, the BMW 2500 CS, and this meant the end for Glas. 277 copies of 2600 GT was made and 389 of the 3000 GT.\n\nIn 1951 Andreas Glas (1923-1990), son of Hans Glas, saw the Vespa scooter from Piaggio in an agricultural machines exposition in Verona, Italy. He was so enthused that he began production of motor scooters that July.\n\nThe scooter debuted with a 125 cc motor, increased over time to 150 cc and 200 cc. Until 1956 46,181 motor scooters were built. Production of scooters stopped because of the Goggomobil cars. From 1953 on, load-carrying scooters were built as well. With the 200 cc engine and 9.5 bhp, they had a load capacity of 200 kg.\n\n\nIn 1962 BMW released the BMW 1500. The popular four-door compact's success exhausted the production capacity of the Munich plant. In 1966 the management decided to buy Glas and absorb the Glas model line. Most of Glas' existing lineup was retired, while some models ended up being badged as BMWs until the company was fully absorbed. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to gain access to Glas' development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications, although some saw Glas' Dingolfing plant as another incentive. However, this factory was outmoded and BMW's biggest immediate gain was, according to themselves, a stock of highly qualified engineers and other personnel. The Glas factory began the manufacture of BMW front and rear axles until they could be modernized and fully incorporated into BMW.\n\nBMW immediately retired most of the Glas range, including all of the outdated microcars.\n\n\nIn the late 1960s BMW shut down Glas and built entirely new production facilities, which would eventually become an important production site. , BMW's Dingolfing branch is BMW's largest factory, with 22,000 workers producing 5, 6 and 7 Series cars and as well as bodies for Rolls-Royce.\n\n"}

It was conceived by a group of scholars surrounding Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, notably by the lawyer and politician Aurel Popovici.\n\nThe first program for the federalisation of the Habsburg Empire was developed by the Hungarian nobleman Wesselényi Miklós. In his work titled \"Szózat a magyar és a szláv nemzetiség ügyében\" and published in Hungarian in 1843 and in German in 1844, he proposed not only social reforms but reforms of the state structure of the Empire and its nationality policy. He aimed to replace the centralized empire with a federation of five states: a German state, a state of Bohemia and Moravia, Galicia as a Polish state, and the state of historical Hungary\n\nAnother idea came from Hungarian revolutionary Lajos Kossuth: \"True liberty is impossible without federalism\". Kossuth proposed to transform the Habsburg Empire into a \"Danubian State\", a federal republic with autonomous regions.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 established the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. The Compromise partially re-established the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hungary, separate from, and no longer subject to the Austrian Empire. However, the favoritism shown to the Magyars, the second largest ethnic group in the dual monarchy after the Germans, caused discontent on the part of other ethnic groups like the Slovaks and Romanians.\n\nAs the twentieth century started to unfold, the greatest problem facing the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary was that it consisted of about a dozen distinctly different ethnic groups, of which only two, the Germans and Hungarians (who together accounted for about 44% of the total population), wielded any power or control. The other ethnic groups, which were not involved in the state affairs, included Slavic (Bosniaks, Croats, Czechs, Poles, Ruthenians, Serbs, Slovaks, Slovenes and Ukrainians) and Romance peoples (Italians, Romanians). Among them, only Croats had limited autonomy in the Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia. In the Kingdom of Hungary, several ethnic minorities faced increased pressures of Magyarization.\n\nThe idea of the Dual Monarchy system of 1867 had been to transform the previous Austrian Empire into a constitutional union, one German-dominated and one Hungarian-dominated part, having also common institutions. However, after various demonstrations, uprisings and acts of terrorism, it became readily apparent that the notion of two ethnic groups dominating the other ten could not survive \"in perpetuum\".\n\nFranz Ferdinand had planned to redraw the map of Austria-Hungary radically, creating a number of ethnically and linguistically dominated semi-autonomous \"states\" which would all be part of a larger federation renamed the United States of Greater Austria. Under this plan, language and cultural identification was encouraged, and the disproportionate balance of power would be corrected. The idea was set to encounter heavy opposition from the Hungarian part of the Dual Monarchy, since a direct result of the reform would have been a significant territorial loss for Hungary.\n\nHowever, the Archduke was assassinated at Sarajevo in 1914, triggering the outbreak of the First World War. After the war, Austria-Hungary was dismantled and several new nation-states were created, and various Austro-Hungarian territories were ceded to neighbouring countries by the victorious Entente powers.\n\nAccording to Popovici's plans, the following territories were to become states of the federation after the reform. The majority ethnic group within each territory is also listed.\n\n\nIn addition, a number of mostly German-speaking enclaves in eastern Transylvania, the Banat and other parts of Hungary, southern Slovenia, large cities (such as Prague, Budapest, Lviv, and others) and elsewhere were to have autonomy within the respective territory.\n\n\n"}

The band was short-lived, released two albums, the self-titled \"Blackjack\" in 1979 and \"Worlds Apart\" in 1980, and embarked on a small US nationwide tour.\n\nBlackjack was formed in late 1978 after Bruce Kulick had come off the road touring with Meat Loaf behind the \"Bat Out of Hell\" album. Kulick and his older brother Bob had done a show backing up Michael Bolton, then a solo artist with two albums, at a club show in Connecticut. Afterwards both Kulick brothers were invited to join Bolotin in a proper band. While Bob declined, Bruce accepted. The band's manager Steve Weiss, also an attorney for Led Zeppelin, brought drummer Sandy Gennaro and bassist Jimmy Haslip into the fold to complete the line-up.\n\nThe band was quickly signed to Polydor Records and named Blackjack. At the behest of their record company and management, the foursome went to work with producer Tom Dowd at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida to record their debut album. \"Blackjack\" was released in 1979 and peaked at No. 127 on the Billboard charts selling around 100,000 copies. The album's biggest single, \"Love Me Tonight\", reached No. 62 on \"Billboard\". Blackjack shot videos for both \"Without Your Love\" and \"Love Me Tonight\", which were part of a 9-minute promotional movie circulated by the label, and toured with acts such as Peter Frampton and the Marshall Tucker Band.\n\nIn 1980, Bruce Kulick played guitar on Billy Squier's solo debut album, \"The Tale of the Tape\", produced by Eddie Offord of Yes fame. Offord also became the producer for Blackjack's second album \"Worlds Apart\". But, with the disappointing sales of their debut album and a regime change at Polydor, Blackjack were no longer a priority act at the label and \"Worlds Apart\" was released in 1980 with very little backing and no tour support from the record company. It spelled the end for Blackjack as individual members had opportunities and offers to join more promising musical situations.\n\nBy 1981, Gennaro had replaced Tommy Aldridge in the Pat Travers Band, making his debut on the \"Radio Active\" album. Haslip would re-team with members of the Robben Ford Band under the name Yellowjackets who issued their self-titled \"debut album\" in 1981. After turning down a touring gig with Billy Squier in favor of staying with Blackjack, Kulick recorded \"Great American Music\" with The Good Rats in 1981 and also played guitar on Michael Bolton's eponymous 1983 \"debut album\" for Columbia Records before joining Kiss in 1984.\n\nThe Blackjack song \"Stay\" off their second album \"Worlds Apart\" was sampled by rapper Jay Z for the song \"A Dream\" off his 2002 album \"\" which reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts.\n\nIn 2004, rapper Kanye West re-recorded a section of \"Maybe It's the Power of Love\" off \"Worlds Apart\" for inclusion on his song \"Never Let Me Down\"; it was released on his triple platinum selling debut album \"The College Dropout\" which peaked at No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" 200. Speaking to the website Genius in 2015, Bolton gave his approval of the sampling, stating that \"the song turned out beautifully\".\n\n\"Blackjack\" and \"Worlds Apart\" were first issued on CD as a two-for-one package by PolyGram in 1990, with a Japanese release following in 1996. UK-based label Lemon Records would do another 2-for-1 reissue in 2006, titled \"Anthology\", with extensive liner notes by English rock journalist Malcolm Dome. The most recent re-issues came in December 2013 when both albums were released individually by Universal Music Japan in the cardboard sleeve mini-LP format as SHM-CD remasters.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2192576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192576", "title": "Super League Greece", "text": "Super League Greece\n\nThe Super League Greece () or Super League 1, is the highest professional football league in Greece. The league was formed on 16 July 2006 and replaced \"Alpha Ethniki\" at the top of the Greek football league system. It consists of 14 teams and runs from August to May, with teams playing 26 games each followed by a 10 game play-off to decide the champions. \n\nAs of September 2019, Super League Greece is ranked 15th in the UEFA ranking of leagues, based on performances in European competitions over the last five years.\nSince the foundation of the first official Panhellenic Championship in 1927, only six clubs have won the title, with the \"POK\" (Olympiacos, Panathinaikos and AEK Athens) dominating and only PAOK, Aris and AEL managing to break their dominance on few occasions.\n\nThe current champions are PAOK, based in Thessaloniki.\n\nBetween 1905 and 1912, a Panhellenic Championship was organised by the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics (SEGAS). This championship was actually a local tournament among clubs from Athens and Piraeus.\n\nAfter the Balkan Wars and World War I, two football associations were formed, one organising a football league in Athens and Piraeus, and one doing the same in Thessaloniki. These were the Athens-Piraeus FCA (EPSAP) and the Macedonia FCA (EPSM). In 1923, a Panhellenic Champion was determined by a play-off game between the Athens-Piraeus and the Thessaloniki champions. Peiraikos Syndesmos won 3–1 against Aris. This panhellenic final was not repeated the following year as the EPSAP was split into the Athens FCA (EPSA) and Piraeus FCA (EPSP) following a dispute.\n\nIn 1927, a national championship was organised in the form of a round-robin tournament between the champions of the three governing bodies. Panathinaikos, Olympiacos and AEK Athens refused to participate and Aris won the first title, finishing ahead of Ethnikos Piraeus and Atromitos. This national championship was set up again in 1929, and over the next years evolved into a tournament in which multiple teams took part. Still, these teams had to qualify for the national championship through their local football competitions.\n\nIn 1959 the \"Alpha Ethniki\" - the precursor of the current Super League - was set up as a national round-robin tournament.\nThe 1959–60 championship was the first to be held in national form after several months of talks. It started on Sunday 25 October 1959 with the participation of 16 teams.\nThe creation of a championship in the form of a single permanent national category rather than the way they have been held until then with the participation of the teams selected by the local competitions was a requirement of both the State and UEFA.\nThe first wished to establish a fixed number of matches every Sunday in Greece to stimulate interest in PRO-PO while UEFA wished to nominate national champions with strict criteria and through joint events for all states.\nThe Hellenic Football Federation (HFF) was obliged to proceed to the abolition of the competitions of the Football Clubs Associations (EPS) of Greece as qualifying stages for the Pan-Hellenic Championship. The first place was taken by Alpha Ethniki, a single category with clubs from all over the Greek territory and a stable participation, with the exception of those who would be relegated at the end of the season.\nThe initial design provided for a number of teams well above the 10th of the 1958–59 Pan-Hellenic Championship and in particular 18 which, as the expanded category program would cover almost all the available dates of the year, would no longer participate in its local competitions their EPSs.\nThose would be the qualifier for the upcoming national category and not the participation in the final round of the current championship, so their significance was significantly reduced.\nOn Saturday, October 10, 1959 at the General Assembly of the HFF, ie with the participation of all the members of the Association of Football Associations and in the presence of the General Secretariat of Sports (GGA) and representatives of the Karamanlis government, became the first national category of Greek football. The 1st game was set for 15 days.\nAccording to the general Assembly of HFF in 29 August 1959, it was decided that the newly created Alpha Ethniki would consist of 18 teams, with their determination being made in accordance with the positions in the local EPS competitions in the period 1958–59.\nThe HFF, at its decisive General Assembly on Saturday, October 10, decided to reduce the number of teams to 16 so that the racing program will not be extended in the summer.\nAfter the end of the first event in the summer of 1960, the teams did not increase despite HFF's initial intention, with the number 16 being considered the ideal for a championship in Greece and only 18 in 1967.\n\nThe teams that participated in the first championship of the Alpha Ethniki were the following:\nOn 25 October 1959, the Alpha Ethniki was launched. Panathinaikos won the first Alpha Ethniki's Championship, which became the champion of Greece for the fourth time in his history. He scored at 79 points with AEK Athens and beat 2–1 in the barrage, a match where he needed only a tie result in the neutral Karaiskakis Stadium.\nIn such a case, after the half-hour extension, the competition announcement set the best goal difference. Through barrage and with the same score was also the third place for the demotion, with the winner Panegialios to overtake Pankorinthiakos again in the event of a draw. The scoring system was 3p the win, 2p the draw, 1p the defeat.\n\nTime has been relentless for some teams that have participated in the first league of the Alpha Ethniki. The historic Ethnikos Piraeus, cup winner of Greece in 1933, participates in the Gamma Ethniki, as well as Proodeftiki while AE Nikaia participates in the local championship of Piraeus.\nApollon Kalamaria, Doxa Drama and Iraklis are fighting in the Beta Ethniki, while Pankorinthiakos, a few years after joining Alpha Ethniki, merged with Aris Korinthos and created PAS Korinthos, which reached the Alpha Ethniki at the 90's and is now participating in the Gamma Ethniki.\nMegas Alexandros Katerini is the ancestor of Pierikos. In 1961, they merged with Olympos Katerini and created Pierikos who plays in the Gamma Ethniki.\n\nOn 19 January 1979 a bill was passed in the Hellenic Parliament under which football clubs became Football Incorporated Companies (PAE or ΠΑΕ in Greek). The Association of Football Incorporated Companies (EPAE, ΕΠΑΕ in Greek), under the supervision of the HFF, has since held the responsibility to hold the championship, with Makis Ithakisios being elected its first president. \nInitially the shares were owned by the sports union to which the football club belonged. Yet soon after, prominent Greek businessmen (shipowners, oil magnates, bankers etc.) began acquiring the newly formed PAEs by buying the majority of their shares, and then increasing their share capital, thus turning Greek football into a fully commercialised and highly profitable business for the decades to come.\n\nFor a single racing season, 2000–01, the championship is renamed \"Upper Category\".\n\nOn 16 July 2006, was founded the copartnership \"Super League\". Members of the copartnership are the PAE's that have the right to participate in the professional football championship of the First Division. The main activity of the copartnership is the organization and conduct of the First Division's Championship according to the regulations and decisions of the Hellenic Football Federation (HFF) and the supreme international football confederations (UEFA, FIFA).\n\nAt present, 14 clubs compete in the Super League, playing each other in a 26 game home and away series. At the end of the season, the top 6 clubs face each other in a 10 game championship round to decide the Super League champions but also the teams to enter the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. \n\nThe bottom 8 clubs face each other in play-outs to decide who gets relegated to Super League 2. In their place, the top two teams from Super League 2 are promoted. The number of teams to be relegated may change, depending on a licensing procedure that takes place at the end of the regular season.\n\nThe Super League is currently entitled to two entrants into the UEFA Champions League. The Champion currently enters the third qualifying round through the champion path, while the runner-ups enter the second round of the League Path. The three Europa League spots go to the teams that finished 3rd to 5th, with no European berth for \nthe Greek Cup winner.\n\nThe following 14 clubs will compete in the Super League 1 during the 2019–20 season.\n\n\n\nPanhellenic Championship\n\nNational League (Alpha Ethniki)\n\nProfessional League (A'Eth./Sup.League)\nSource: epo.gr\n\nThe six clubs that have won the championship are from a total of three cities:\n\nThe six clubs that have won the championship are from a total of three regions:\n\nThe number of seasons that each team (in alphabetical order) has played in the top division from 1959–60 until 2019–20.

{"id": "2192581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192581", "title": "Pepin the Short", "text": "Pepin the Short\n\nPepin the Short (, , c. 714 – 24 September 768) was the King of the Franks from 751 until his death in 768. He was the first of the Carolingians to become king.\n\nThe younger son of the Frankish prince Charles Martel and his wife Rotrude, Pepin's upbringing was distinguished by the ecclesiastical education he had received from the monks of St. Denis. Succeeding his father as the Mayor of the Palace in 741, Pepin reigned over Francia jointly with his elder brother Carloman. Pepin ruled in Neustria, Burgundy and Provence, while his older brother Carloman established himself in Austrasia, Alemannia and Thuringia. The brothers were active in suppressing revolts led by the Bavarians, Aquitanians, Saxons and the Alemanni in the early years of their reign. In 743, they ended the Frankish interregnum by choosing Childeric III, who was to be the last Merovingian monarch, as figurehead king of the Franks.\n\nBeing well disposed towards the church and papacy on account of their ecclesiastical upbringing, Pepin and Carloman continued their father's work in supporting Saint Boniface in reforming the Frankish church, and evangelising the Saxons. After Carloman, who was an intensely pious man, retired to religious life in 747, Pepin became the sole ruler of the Franks. He suppressed a revolt led by his half-brother Grifo, and succeeded in becoming the undisputed master of all Francia. Giving up pretense, Pepin then forced Childeric into a monastery and had himself proclaimed king of the Franks with support of Pope Zachary in 751. The decision was not supported by all members of the Carolingian family and Pepin had to put down a revolt led by Carloman's son, Drogo, and again by Grifo.\n\nAs king, Pepin embarked on an ambitious program to expand his power. He reformed the legislation of the Franks and continued the ecclesiastical reforms of Boniface. Pepin also intervened in favour of the papacy of Stephen II against the Lombards in Italy. He was able to secure several cities, which he then gave to the Pope as part of the Donation of Pepin. This formed the legal basis for the Papal States in the Middle Ages. The Byzantines, keen to make good relations with the growing power of the Frankish empire, gave Pepin the title of Patricius. In wars of expansion, Pepin conquered Septimania from the Islamic Umayyads, and subjugated the southern realms by repeatedly defeating Waiofar and his Gascon troops, after which the Gascon and Aquitanian lords saw no option but to pledge loyalty to the Franks. Pepin was, however, troubled by the relentless revolts of the Saxons and the Bavarians. He campaigned tirelessly in Germany, but the final subjugation of these tribes was left to his successors.\n\nPepin died in 768 and was succeeded by his sons Charlemagne and Carloman. Although unquestionably one of the most powerful and successful rulers of his time, Pepin's reign is largely overshadowed by that of his more famous son, Charlemagne.\n\nPepin's father Charles Martel died in 741. He divided the rule of the Frankish kingdom between Pepin and his elder brother, Carloman, his surviving sons by his first wife: Carloman became Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia, Pepin became Mayor of the Palace of Neustria. Grifo, Charles's son by his second wife, Swanahild (also known as Swanhilde), demanded a share in the inheritance, but he was besieged in Laon, forced to surrender and imprisoned in a monastery by his two half-brothers.\n\nIn the Frankish realm the unity of the kingdom was essentially connected with the person of the king. So Carloman, to secure this unity, raised the Merovingian Childeric to the throne (743). Then in 747 Carloman either resolved to or was pressured into entering a monastery. This left Francia in the hands of Pepin as sole mayor of the palace and \"dux et princeps Francorum\".\n\nAt the time of Carloman's retirement, Grifo escaped his imprisonment and fled to Duke Odilo of Bavaria, who was married to Hiltrude, Pepin's sister. Pepin put down the renewed revolt led by his half-brother and succeeded in completely restoring the boundaries of the kingdom.\n\nUnder the reorganization of Francia by Charles Martel, the \"dux et princeps Francorum\" was the commander of the armies of the kingdom, in addition to his administrative duties as mayor of the palace.\n\nAs mayor of the palace, Pepin was formally subject to the decisions of Childeric III who had only the title of King but no power. Since Pepin had control over the magnates and actually had the power of a king, he now addressed to Pope Zachary a suggestive question:\n\nHard pressed by the Lombards, Pope Zachary welcomed this move by the Franks to end an intolerable condition and lay the constitutional foundations for the exercise of the royal power. The Pope replied that such a state of things is not proper. In these circumstances, the \"de facto\" power was considered more important than the \"de jure\" authority.\n\nAfter this decision the throne was declared vacant. Childeric III was deposed and confined to a monastery. He was the last of the Merovingians.\n\nPepin was then elected King of the Franks by an assembly of Frankish nobles, with a large portion of his army on hand. The earliest account of his election and anointing is the \"Clausula de Pippino\" written around 767. Meanwhile, Grifo continued his rebellion, but was eventually killed in the battle of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne in 753.\n\nPepin was assisted by his friend Vergilius of Salzburg, an Irish monk who probably used a copy of the \"Collectio canonum Hibernensis\" (an Irish collection of canon law) to advise him to receive royal unction to assist his recognition as king. Anointed a first time in 751 in Soissons, Pepin added to his power after Pope Stephen II traveled all the way to Paris to anoint him a second time in a lavish ceremony at the Basilica of St Denis in 754, bestowing upon him the additional title of patricius Romanorum (Patrician of the Romans) and is the first recorded crowning of a civil ruler by a Pope. As life expectancies were short in those days, and Pepin wanted family continuity, the Pope also anointed Pepin's sons, Charles (eventually known as Charlemagne), who was 12, and Carloman, who was 3.\n\nPepin's first major act as king was to go to war against the Lombard king Aistulf, who had expanded into the \"ducatus Romanus\". After a meeting with Pope Stephen II at Ponthion, Pepin forced the Lombard king to return property seized from the Church. He confirmed the papacy in possession of Ravenna and the Pentapolis, the so-called Donation of Pepin, whereby the Papal States were established and the temporal reign of the papacy officially began. At about 752, he turned his attention to Septimania. The new king headed south in a military expedition down the Rhone valley and received the submission of eastern Septimania (i.e. Nîmes, Maguelone, Beziers and Agde) after securing count Ansemund's allegiance. The Frankish king went on to invest Narbonne, the main Umayyad stronghold in Septimania, but could not capture it from the Iberian Muslims until seven years later in 759, when they were driven out to Hispania.\n\nAquitaine still remained under Waiofar's Gascon-Aquitanian rule, however, and beyond Frankish reach. Duke Waiofar appears to have confiscated Church lands, maybe distributing them among his troops. In 760, after conquering the Roussillon from the Muslims and denouncing Waiofar's actions, Pepin moved his troops over to and Albi, ravaged with fire and sword most of Aquitaine, and, in retaliation, counts loyal to Waiofar ravaged Burgundy. Pepin, in turn, besieged the Aquitanian-held towns and strongholds of Bourbon, Clermont, Chantelle, Bourges and Thouars, defended by Waiofar's Gascon troops, who were overcome, captured and deported into northern France with their children and wives.\n\nIn 763, Pepin advanced further into the heart of Waiofar's domains and captured major strongholds (Poitiers, Limoges, Angoulême, etc.), after which Waiofar counterattacked and war became bitter. Pepin opted to spread terror, burning villas, destroying vineyards and depopulating monasteries. By 765, the brutal tactics seemed to pay off for the Franks, who destroyed resistance in central Aquitaine and devastated the whole region. The city of Toulouse was conquered by Pepin in 767 as was Waiofar's capital of Bordeaux.\n\nAs a result, Aquitanian nobles and Gascons from beyond the Garonne too saw no option but to accept a pro-Frankish peace treaty (Fronsac, c. 768). Waiofar escaped but was assassinated by his own frustrated followers in 768.\n\nPepin died during a campaign, in 768 at the age of 54. He was interred in the Basilica of Saint Denis in modern-day Metropolitan Paris. His wife Bertrada was also interred there in 783. Charlemagne rebuilt the Basilica in honor of his parents and placed markers at the entrance.\n\nThe Frankish realm was divided according to the Salic law between his two sons: Charlemagne and Carloman I.\n\nHistorical opinion often seems to regard him as the lesser son and lesser father of two greater men, though a great man in his own right. He continued to build up the heavy cavalry which his father had begun. He maintained the standing army that his father had found necessary to protect the realm and form the core of its full army in wartime. He not only contained the Iberian Muslims as his father had, but drove them out of what is now France and, as important, he managed to subdue the Aquitanians and the Gascons after three generations of on-off clashes, so opening the gate to central and southern Gaul and Muslim Iberia. He continued his father's expansion of the Frankish church (missionary work in Germany and Scandinavia) and the institutional infrastructure (feudalism) that would prove the backbone of medieval Europe.\n\nHis rule, while not as great as either his father's or son's, was historically important and of great benefit to the Franks as a people. Pepin's assumption of the crown, and the title of Patrician of Rome, were harbingers of his son's imperial coronation which is usually seen as the founding of the Kingdom of France. He made the Carolingians \"de jure\" what his father had made them \"de facto\"—the ruling dynasty of the Franks and the foremost power of Europe. Known as a great conqueror, he was undefeated during his lifetime.\n\nPepin married Leutberga from the Danube region. They had five children. She was repudiated some time after the birth of Charlemagne and her children were sent to convents.\n\nIn 741, Pepin married Bertrada, daughter of Caribert of Laon. They are known to have had eight children, at least three of whom survived to adulthood:\n\n\n"}

The album peaked at #143 on the \"Billboard\" albums chart in the US; and #22 on the RIANZ albums chart in New Zealand. \"Delicious Surprise\" was later recorded by Jo Dee Messina on her 2005 album of the same name, from which it was released as a single.\n"}
{"id": "2192596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192596", "title": "Marine conservation", "text": "Marine conservation\n\nMarine conservation, also known as ocean conservation, refers to the study of marine plants and animal resources and ecosystem functions. It is the protection and preservation of ecosystems in oceans and seas through planned management in order to prevent the exploitation of these resources. Marine conservation is driven by the manifested negative effects being seen in our environment such as species loss, habitat degradation and changes in ecosystem functions and focuses on limiting human-caused damage to marine ecosystems, restoring damaged marine ecosystems, and preserving vulnerable species and ecosystems of the marine life. Marine conservation is a relatively new discipline which has developed as a response to biological issues such as extinction and marine habitats change.\n\nMarine conservationists rely on a combination of scientific principles derived from marine biology, oceanography, and fisheries science, as well as on human factors such as, demand for marine resources and marine law, economics and policy, in order to determine how to best protect and conserve marine species and ecosystems. Marine conservation may be described as a sub-discipline of conservation biology.\n\nCoral reefs are the epicenter of immense amounts of biodiversity and are a key player in the survival of entire ecosystems. They provide various marine animals with food, protection, and shelter which keep generations of species alive. Furthermore, coral reefs are an integral part of sustaining human life through serving as a food source (i.e., fish and mollusks) as well as a marine space for ecotourism which provides economic benefits. Also, humans are now conducting research regarding the use of corals as new potential sources for pharmaceuticals (i.e. steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs).\n\nUnfortunately, because of the human impact on coral reefs, these ecosystems are becoming increasingly degraded and in need of conservation. The biggest threats include overfishing, destructive fishing practices, sedimentation, and pollution from land-based sources. This, in conjunction with increased carbon in oceans, coral bleaching, and diseases, means that there are no pristine reefs anywhere in the world. Up to 88% of coral reefs in Southeast Asia are now threatened, with 50% of those reefs at either \"high\" or \"very high\" risk of disappearing, which directly affects the biodiversity and survival of species dependent on coral.\n\nThis is especially harmful to island nations such as Samoa, Indonesia, and the Philippines, because many people there depend on the coral reef ecosystems to feed their families and to make a living. However, many fishermen are unable to catch as many fish as they used to, so they are increasingly using cyanide and dynamite in fishing, which further degrades the coral reef ecosystem. This perpetuation of bad habits simply leads to the further decline of coral reefs and therefore perpetuates the problem. One way of stopping this cycle is by educating the local community about why the conservation of marine spaces that include coral reefs is important.\n\nIncreasing human populations have resulted in increased human impact on ecosystems. Human activities has resulted in an increased extinction rate of species which has caused a major decrease in biological diversity of plants and animals in our environment. These impacts include increased pressure from fisheries including reef degradation and overfishing as well as pressure from the tourism industry which has increased over the past few years. The deterioration of coral reefs is mainly linked to human activities – 88% of reefs are threatened through various reasons as listed above, including excessive amounts of CO (carbon dioxide) emissions. Oceans absorb approximately 1/3 of the CO produced by humans, which has detrimental effects on the marine environment. The increasing levels of CO in oceans change the seawater chemistry by decreasing the pH, which is known as ocean acidification.\n\nOil spills also impact marine environments, contributing to marine pollution as a result of human activity. The effects of oil on marine fish have been studied following major spills in the United States.\n\nShipping is a major vector for the introduction of exotic marine species, some of which can become overabundant and transform ecosystems. Collisions with ships can also be fatal for whales and can impact on the viability of whole populations, including the right whale population off the east coast of the United States.\n\nOverfishing is one of main causes of the decrease in the ocean’s wildlife population over the past years. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation, around a third of the world’s fishing companies are pushing past the suggested limits in terms of biological safety. The overfishing of these large fisheries not only destroys the marine environment, but it threatens the livelihood of billions who depend on fish as protein or as a source of income for catching and selling.\n\nOverfishing continues to be a struggle due to the illegal catch and trade that occurs outside of the free market. According to the World Wildlife Organization (WWF), an estimated $36.4 billion is made each year from illegal and unreported fishing. This illegal activity has led to both a degraded ecosystem, but also a disruption to the fish economy that is the highest for the food trading commodity. This industry is crucial to fuel our global economy and half the population which is estimated to rely on fish.\n\nIllegal fishing also relates to the hundreds of thousands of mammals (specifically sharks) that are killed and/ captured every year. World Wildlife mentions that one of the most impacted species is Tuna with some of the impacted locations being the Arctic and Coastal east Africa.\n\nSome solutions that are being pursued by the WWF include improving management in the Easter Pacific tuna fisheries and the expansion of marine protected areas.\n\nOverabundance can occur when the population of a certain species cannot be controlled naturally or by human intervention. The domination of one species can create an imbalance in an ecosystem, which can lead to the demise of other species and of the habitat. Overabundance occurs predominately among invasive species.\n\nThe international shipping trade has led to the establishment of many marine species beyond their native ranges. Some of these can have adverse consequences, such as the North pacific seastar which was introduced to Tasmania, Australia. Vectors for the translocation of organisms include hull biofouling, the dumping of ballast water and dumping of water from marine aquaria. A tank of ballast water is estimated to contain around 3,000 non-native species. Once established, it is difficult to eradicate an exotic organism from an ecosystem.\n\nThe San Francisco Bay is one of the places in the world that is the most impacted by foreign and invasive species. According to the Baykeeper organization, 97 percent of the organisms in the San Francisco Bay have been compromised by the 240 invasive species that have been brought into the ecosystem. Invasive species in the bay such as the Asian clam have changed the food web of the ecosystem by depleting populations of native species such as plankton. The Asian clam clogs pipes and obstructs the flow of water in electrical generating facilities. Their presence in the San Francisco Bay has cost the United States an estimated one billion dollars in damages.\n\nStrategies and techniques for marine conservation tend to combine theoretical disciplines, such as population biology, with practical conservation strategies, such as setting up protected areas, as with marine protected areas (MPAs) or Voluntary Marine Conservation Areas. These protected areas may be established for a variety of reasons and aim to limit the impact of human activity. These protected areas operate differently which includes areas that have seasonal closures and/or permanent closures as well as multiple levels of zoning that allow people to carryout different activities in separate areas; including, speed, no take and multi-use zones.\n\nOther techniques include developing sustainable fisheries and restoring the populations of endangered species through artificial means.\n\nAnother focus of conservationists is on curtailing human activities that are detrimental to either marine ecosystems or species through policy, techniques such as fishing quotas, like those set up by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, or laws such as those listed below. Recognizing the economics involved in human use of marine ecosystems is key, as is education of the public about conservation issues. This includes educating tourists that come to an area who might not be familiar with certain regulations regarding the marine habitat. One example of this is a project called Green Fins based in Southeast Asia that uses the scuba diving industry to educate the public. This project, implemented by UNEP, encourages scuba diving operators to educate their students about the importance of marine conservation and encourage them to dive in an environmentally friendly manner that does not damage coral reefs or associated marine ecosystems.\n\nScientists divide the process by a few parts, and there are various techniques in each part of it. In marking and capturing, the normal techniques include techniques for restraint in pinnipeds, chemical restraint and immobilization in pinnipeds, techniques for capture-release of cetaceans and techniques for restraint and handling.\n\nRecently, some novel approaches include remote sensing techniques to model exposure of coastal-marine ecosystems to riverine flood plumes and advanced iconography.\n\nTechniques also include many social science researches, many researches have founded the effectiveness of marine conservation through the change of social events and encourage sustainable tourism development to raise the public awareness of it. Researchers suggest to integrating customary management into marine conservation and emphasize that practical and conceptual differences exist between customary management and contemporary conservation which have often led to failed attempts to hybridize these systems.\n\nOthers have suggest to Integrating Marine conservation and tourism, the establishment of conservation areas can help reduce conflicts through zoning for different uses the protected areas and enables the grouping of compatible activities into specific zones and the separation of those which are incompatible.\n\nCommon techniques for arise general public’s attention also include the more exposure of carbon footprint concept, and educate people to make sustainable seafood choices and use fewer plastic products.\n\nMarine conservation technologies are used to protect endangered and threatened marine organisms and/or habitat. These technologies are innovative and revolutionary because they reduce by-catch, increase the survivor-ship and health of marine life and habitat, and benefit fishermen who depend on the resources for profit. Examples of technologies include marine protected areas (MPAs), turtle excluder devices (TEDs), autonomous recording unit, pop-up satellite archival tag, and radio-frequency identification (RFID). Commercial practicality plays an important role in the success of marine conservation because it is necessary to cater to the needs of fishermen while also protecting marine life.\n\nPop-up satellite archival tag (PSAT or PAT) plays a vital role in marine conservation by providing marine biologists with an opportunity to study animals in their natural environments. These are used to track movements of (usually large, migratory) marine animals. A PSAT is an archival tag (or data logger) that is equipped with a means to transmit the collected data via satellite. Though the data are physically stored on the tag, its major advantage is that it does not have to be physically retrieved like an archival tag for the data to be available, making it a viable independent tool for animal behavior studies. These tags have been used to track movements of ocean sunfish, marlin, blue sharks, bluefin tuna, swordfish and sea turtles. Location, depth, temperature, and body movement data are used to answer questions about migratory patterns, seasonal feeding movements, daily habits, and survival after catch and release.\n\nTurtle excluder devices (TEDs) remove a major threat to turtles in their marine environment. Many sea turtles are accidentally captured, injured or killed by fishing. In response to this threat the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) worked with the shrimp trawling industry to create the TEDs. By working with the industry they insured the commercial viability of the devices. A TED is a series of bars that is placed at the top or bottom of a trawl net, fitting the bars into the \"neck\" of the shrimp trawl and acting as a filter to ensure that only small animals may pass through. The shrimp will be caught but larger animals such as marine turtles that become caught by the trawler will be rejected by the filter function of the bars.\n\nSimilarly, halfway technologies work to increase the population of marine organisms. However, they do so without behavioral changes, and address the symptoms but not the cause of the declines. Examples of halfway technologies include hatcheries and fish ladders.\n\nInternational laws and treaties related to marine conservation include the 1966 Convention on Fishing and Conservation of Living Resources of the High Seas. United States laws related to marine conservation include the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act, as well as the 1972 Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, which established the National Marine Sanctuaries program.\n\nIn 2010, the Scottish Parliament enacted new legislation for the protection of marine life with the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010. Its provisions include marine planning, marine licensing, marine conservation, seal conservation, and enforcement.\n\nSince 2006, united nations introduce vulnerable marine ecosystem concept for the management of deep-sea fisheries in the areas beyond national jurisdiction. This concept has been transposed by the European parliament for Atlantic European waters.\n\nThere are marine conservation organizations throughout the world that focus on funding conservation efforts, educating the public and stakeholders, and lobbying for conservation law and policy. Examples of these include Oceana, the Marine Conservation Institute (United States), Blue Frontier Campaign (United States), Sea Shepherd Conservation Society (international), Frontier (the Society for Environmental Exploration) (United Kingdom), Marine Conservation Society (United Kingdom), Community Centered Conservation (C3), the Reef-World Foundation (United Kingdom), Reef Watch (India), Marinelife Alliance (Bangladesh), Live Ocean (New Zealand), ProtectedSeas (United States), and Australian Marine Conservation Society. Zoox (United Kingdom) is an example of an organization that provides both marine conservation training and professional career development to volunteers who are also working on marine conservation projects such as Green Fins.\n\nOn a regional level, PERSGA, the Regional Organization for the Conservation of the Environment of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, is a regional entity which serves as the secretariat for the Jeddah Convention-1982, one of the first regional marine agreements. PERSGA member states are Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.\n\nThere have been a number of organized efforts from marine conservation groups such as those aforementioned in this article to raise awareness of the human impact on the situation and inspire people to take action. Some groups take on more public facing campaigns that directly attempt to get civilians engaged with the issue compared to other groups who encourage donations from civilians which goes towards lobbying and advocacy towards the government.\n\nOcean Conservancy and its International Coastal Cleanup is an example of a public-facing campaign that aims to increase participation in conservation efforts among every day civilians. On a predetermined date every year, Ocean Conservancy promotes The International Coastal Cleanup to rally communities to volunteer to collect trash from the coastlines across the globe. The campaign has expanded originally from its two founders and has now reached over 100 countries.\n\nOceana is an example of an advocacy/lobbying group that encourages donations as a means to enact legislation and protect the laws of the ocean. Specifically, Oceana is currently lobbying to prevent the expansion of offshore drilling with emphasis in areas such as the Arctic and Belize. Oceana is currently mentioned in a wide range of bills in the US Congress regarding issues such as anti-drilling protections on the Atlantic coast and the penalty for buying, selling, possessing, or transporting shark fins.\n\nGreenpeace is another non-profit organization that seeks to campaign for a healthier environment and more sustainable environmental practices. While the organization adresses a wide range of topics outside of ocean conservation, it is currently focusing in on plastic pollution, sustainable seafood, and protecting the Arctic. They provide information online on their website regarding their current efforts which can help people get connected to the correct resources to make a difference in their community.\n\nThere have been a wide variety of different events and initiatives to spread the message about the issue.\n\nThis film festival is the largest ocean destination event according to the MCI. Also known as the IOFF, this event is a four-day film festival that includes over 50 films related to ocean-life around the globe. This event is made to educate viewers and the audience on the environmental issues that are negatively impacting the ocean. Films also include potential solutions to help protect the ocean and environment as well.\n\nThis summit is led by Boardriders Foundation, XPRIZE Foundation, and Marisla Foundation. The summit is more interactive as it provides a panel of speakers as well as a portion for questions and answers. Towards the latter half of the event, companies and individuals are able to participate in a workshop so they can learn more about the benefits of a “blue economy”. This event is centered towards the California population\n\n<nowiki>#</nowiki>SaveOurOceans is a social media campaign that draws NGOs and social media platforms together in the form of a TikTok contest. TikTok has partnered with Conservation International to protect marine life. The #SaveOurOceans campaign was able to reach globally due to influencers spreading the message to a wide audience. Local and global influencers alike played a role in spreading the campaign. TikTok declared that they would donate $2 for every video uploaded with the hashtag, up to $100,000, towards protecting oceans and marine life by reducing plastic waste.\n\n<nowiki>#</nowiki>SuitUpToCleanUp is another social media campaign centered around promoting marine conservation. Launched in August and September of 2018 by Ocean Conservancy, the campaign was intended to inspire participants to clean up pollution in their local waterways. The campaign was meant to coincide with Ocean Conservancy's 33rd Annual International Coastal Cleanup (ICC) on September 15, 2018. The phrase #SuitUpToCleanUp was a way for people to share their stories of how they helped clean up in unique ways.\n\nBaleen whales were predominantly hunted from 1600 through the mid-1900s, and were nearing extinction when a global ban on commercial whaling was put into effect in 1986 by the IWC (International Whaling Convention). The Atlantic gray whale, last sighted in 1740, is now extinct due to European and Native American Whaling. Since the 1960s the global population of monk seals has been rapidly declining. The Hawaiian and Mediterranean monk seals are considered to be one of the most endangered marine mammals on the planet, according to the NOAA. The last sighting of the Caribbean monk seal was in 1952, and it has now been confirmed extinct by the NOAA. The vaquita porpoise, discovered in 1958, has become the most endangered marine species. Over half the population has disappeared since 2012, leaving 100 left in 2014. The vaquita frequently drowns in fishing nets, which are used illegally in marine protected areas off the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn 2004, the Marine Turtle Specialist Group (MTSG), from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), ran an assessment which determined that green turtles were globally endangered. Population decline in ocean basins is indicated through data collected by the MTSG that analyzes abundance and historical information on the species. This data examined the global population of green turtles at 32 nesting sites, and determined that over the last 100–150 years there has been a 48–65 percent decrease in the number of mature nesting females. The Kemp's ridley sea turtle population fell in 1947 when 33,000 nests, which accounted for 80 percent of the population, were collected and sold by villagers in Racho Nuevo, Mexico. In the early 1960s only 5,000 individuals were left, and between 1978 and 1991, 200 Kemp's Ridley Turtles nested annually. In 2015, the World Wildlife Fund and \"National Geographic Magazine\" named the Kemp's ridley the most endangered sea turtle in the world, with 1000 females nesting annually.\n\nIn 2014, the IUCN moved the Pacific bluefin tuna from \"least concerned\" to \"vulnerable\" on a scale that represents level of extinction risk. The Pacific bluefin tuna is targeted by the fishing industry mainly for its use in sushi. A stock assessment released in 2013 by the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-Like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC) shows that the Pacific bluefin tuna population dropped by 96 percent in the Pacific Ocean. According to the ISC assessment, 90 percent of the Pacific bluefin tuna caught are juveniles that have not reproduced.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2014, the European eel, Japanese eel, and American eel were put on the IUCN red list of endangered species. In 2015, the Environmental Agency concluded that the number of European eels has declined by 95 percent since 1990. An Environmental Agency officer, Andy Don, who has been researching eels for the past 20 years, said, \"There is no doubt that there is a crisis. People have been reporting catching a kilo of glass eels this year when they would expect to catch 40 kilos. We have got to do something.\"\n\nJohnson's seagrass, a food source for the endangered green sea turtle, is the scarcest species in its genus. It reproduces asexually, which limits its ability to populate and colonize habitats. Data on this species is limited, but it is known that since the 1970s there has been a 50 percent decrease in abundance.\n\nModern marine conservation first became globally recognized in the 1970s after World War II in an era known as the \"marine revolution\". The United States federal legislation showed its support of marine conservation by institutionalizing protected areas and creating marine estuaries. In the mid-1970s the United States formed the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Through this program, nations could communicate and make agreements about marine conservation. After the formation of the IUCN, new independent organizations known as non-governmental organizations started to appear. These organizations were self-governed and had individual goals for marine conservation. At the end of the 1970s, undersea explorations equipped with new technology such as computers were undertaken. During these explorations, fundamental principles of change were discovered in relation to marine ecosystems. Through this discovery, the interdependent nature of the ocean was revealed. This led to a change in the approach of marine conservation efforts, and a new emphasis was put on restoring systems within the environment, along with protecting biodiversity.\n\n\n\n"}

It received generally good reviews as a showcase for the band’s experimental/psychedelic pop.\n\nThe album is the band’s first major change in production style compared to earlier albums. Up until \"The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone\", producer and band leader Robert Schneider would usually implement a Wall of Sound style of production on his records whereas on this album he chose to pursue a more \"raw\" sound. This was to portray a sound more similar to how the band sounded during live performances versus a typically more orchestrated quality of sound. In an interview flexi disc, included on the vinyl-LP version of the album, Schneider remarks: \"That was a lesson I learned from Led Zeppelin and from The Beatles—is that one guitar can go a long way. I used to take a Phil Spector approach which was that a lot of guitars can go a long way. Now I’m kind of going more for the feeling of the way we sound.\"\n\nIn addition to change in production style, the style of genre itself is also something of a departure from the usual 1960s psychedelic pop sound trademarked by earlier Apples in Stereo records. In songwriting, Schneider took more of an influence from R&B artists such as Sly & the Family Stone and early artists featured on the Motown label. Schneider also wanted the songs to sound more disconnected and unique to themselves than on previous albums. He stated, \"I wanted every song to be self contained...on our other records we always had our songs run together. On this record we left big spaces between all the songs so you have a place to put your needle down on the record.\" This was influenced by records such as \"The White Album\" by The Beatles.\n\nThe title is from a book written in 1638 by English clergyman John Wilkins.\n\nAll tracks written by Robert Schneider except where noted.\n\n\n\nBonus 7\"\nThe vinyl edition of \"The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone\" comes with a bonus 7\" flexidisc with the following tracks:\n\nJapanese version\nThe Japanese version of the album contains the following bonus tracks:\n\n\n\n\"The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone\" was produced and mixed by Robert Schneider.

{"id": "2192622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192622", "title": "Heliometer", "text": "Heliometer\n\nA heliometer (from Greek ἥλιος \"hḗlios\" \"sun\" and \"measure\") is an instrument originally designed for measuring the variation of the sun's diameter at different seasons of the year, but applied now to the modern form of the instrument which is capable of much wider use.\n\nThe basic concept is to introduce a split element into a telescope's optical path so as to produce a double image. If one element is moved using a screw micrometer, precise angle measurements can be made. The simplest arrangement is to split the object lens in half, with one half fixed and the other attached to the micrometer screw and slid along the cut diameter. To measure the diameter of the sun, for example, the micrometer is first adjusted so that the two images of the solar disk coincide (the \"zero\" position where the split elements form essentially a single element). The micrometer is then adjusted so that diametrically opposite sides of the two images of the solar disk just touch each other. The difference in the two micrometer readings so obtained is the (angular) diameter of the sun. Similarly, a precise measurement of the apparent separation between two nearby stars, \"A\" and \"B\", is made by first superimposing the two images of the stars and then adjusting the double image so that star \"A\" in one image coincides with star \"B\" in the other. The difference in the two micrometer readings so obtained is the apparent separation or angular distance between the two stars.\n\nThe first application of the divided object-glass and the employment of double images in astronomical measures is due to Servington Savary from Exeter in 1743. Pierre Bouguer, in 1748, originated the true conception of measurement by double image without the auxiliary aid of a filar micrometer, that is by changing the distance between two object-glasses of equal focus. John Dollond, in 1754, combined Savary's idea of the divided object-glass with Bouguer's method of measurement, resulting in the construction of the first really practical heliometers. As far as we can ascertain, Joseph von Fraunhofer, some time not long before 1820, constructed the first heliometer with an achromatic divided object-glass, i.e. the first heliometer of the modern type.\n\nThe first successful measurements of stellar parallax (to determine the distance to a star) were made by Friedrich Bessel in 1838 for the star 61 Cygni using a Fraunhofer heliometer. This was the aperture Fraunhofer heliometer at Königsberg Observatory built by Joseph von Fraunhofer's firm, though he did not live to see it delivered to Bessel. Although the heliometer was difficult to use, it had certain advantages for Bessel including a wider field of view compared to other great refractors of the period, and overcame atmospheric turbulence in measurements compared to a filar micrometer.\n\n\n\n"}

He also participated in the 1896 Summer Olympics, where he came third at the military rifle.\n\nBorn in Mesolongi in 1868 to Themistoklis Trikoupis (member of the Trikoupis family, related to PM Charilaos Trikoupis), he entered the Greek Army Academy, which he graduated in 1888 as an Artillery Second Lieutenant. He furthered his studies in France, where he remained from 1889 to 1895, completing his tour there with courses at the \"École Supérieure de Guerre\". He competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics, held in Athens, in the military rifle and the free rifle events. He came third in the first with a score of 1,713, after hitting the target 34 times out of a possible 40. His place and score in the second event are unknown, except that he did not finish in the top five.\n\nIn the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, he participated as chief of staff of the 1st Infantry Division. He joined the newly established General Staff Corps in 1904, and participated in the Balkan Wars of 1912–13 as chief of staff of the 3rd Infantry Division and the Damianos Detachment. After the Balkan Wars he served as regimental commander, and served as chief of staff of the III Army Corps and then as Deputy Chief of the Hellenic Army General Staff.\n\nFrom 1917, he fought in the Macedonian front of the First World War as commander of the 3rd Infantry Division, being promoted to Major General in 1918. He again commanded the 3rd Division in the spring and summer 1921 offensives during the Asia Minor Campaign. During the advance onto Eskişehir he also commanded the Northern Group of Divisions, and in July was placed in charge of the Southern Group around Afyonkarahisar. In September, he was moved to command of II Corps and in December to I Corps.\n\nDuring the Turkish offensive in August 1922, Trikoupis was the senior Greek commander on the spot, having 5 divisions at his disposal. Having neglected to provide for adequate reconnaissance, his command was surprised by the Turkish attack. In order to avert the collapse of the front held by the 1st and 4th divisions, he ordered a retreat to the second line of defence NW of Afyon on the 13th. The successful Turkish attacks however and the surrender of parts of I and II Corps a few days later sealed the fate of the Greek Army, which began a hasty withdrawal to the Aegean shore. On 29 August, while at Karaja Hisar, also known as Ali Veran (Greek: Ἀλῆ Βερὰν, modern Allioren, Turkey) near Kutahya, he was attacked by Turkish cavalry and surrendered along with slightly more than 5,000 men and 300 officers.

While no trace of the actual fortification still exists, local tradition, the use of \"Castellano\" in place names and the compact structure of the once walled enclosure all indicate that the fortress existed. The hamlet of Torrazza was the source of bitter fighting between the Swiss Confederation and the Duchy of Milan. In 1604, the Treaty of Varese decided against the Italian municipality of Lavena Ponte Tresa and finally awarded it to Caslano.\n\nThe parish church was built in 1653, incorporating an older building.\n\nThe pre-industrial economy was based on fisheries, mines and kilns for lime and clay, transport by sea, agriculture and by remittances from emigrants. The local wealth is shown in the quality of the buildings in the village and in the neighboring towns of Pura and Collina d'Oro. After World War II, the traditional occupations lost their importance. Agriculture became less common, fisheries disappeared and the mines and furnaces were shut down. Other hand, tourism (hotels, restaurants, vacation homes, second homes), industry, trade and commerce all grew and led to a huge influx of commuters.

{"id": "2192647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192647", "title": "West Virginia Senate", "text": "West Virginia Senate\n\nThe West Virginia Senate is the upper house of the West Virginia Legislature.\nThere are seventeen senatorial districts. Each district has two senators who serve staggered four-year terms. The Democrats gained two seats in the 2018 elections, bringing their total number of seats to 14, while the Republicans still hold a majority with 20.\n\nSenators are elected for terms of four years that are staggered, meaning that only a portion of the 34 state senate seats are up every election.\n\nThe state legislature meets on the second Wednesday of January each year and conducts a 60-day regular session. \n\nUnlike most state senates, the West Virginia Senate can introduce revenue bills. Bills must undergo three readings in each house before being sent to the governor. Bills are drafted by the Office of Legislative Services or legislative staff counsel, reviewed by the sponsor of the bill and submitted for introduction. Bills are assigned to committees that make recommendations about a bill in the form of a committee report.\n\nBills approved in both the West Virginia Senate and West Virginia House of Delegates are then submitted to the governor, who has the power to sign them into law or veto them. The state legislature can override the veto, unless they have already adjourned.\n\nThe state's districting system is unique in the United States. Prior to the 2010 Census the state's most populous county, Kanawha County constituted two \"superimposed\" districts. In practical effect, this meant that Kanawha County was a single district electing two members every two years. The remaining 54 counties of the state were divided into fifteen districts, with county lines not respected in most cases. \n\nUnder the unique rule, no multi-county district (and every district except Kanawha's is a multi-county district) may have more than one senator from the same county, no matter the population. This means, for example, that one of the 5th District's two senators must reside in Cabell County and the other must reside in the tiny portion of Wayne County that's inside the 5th District, even though Cabell County has far more people than the portion of Wayne County that is part of the 5th District. However, both senators are elected by everybody within the district, not just by the people of the county in which the senators reside.\n\nResponding to the 2010 Census the Senate redistricted itself. Kanawha County was divided for the first time in the Senate's history, with the northern and western portions joining a part of Putnam County as the 8th District and the remainder of the county constituting the 17th district on its own. This reduced the number of Senators from Kanawha County from four to three, as one of the 8th's must be a resident of Putnam. \n\nThe remainder of the state was redistricted, reflecting the continuing shift of the state's population to the Eastern Panhandle and to Monongalia County, however no incumbents were placed in districts where they had to run against one another, except for the Kanawha situation. Because senators are elected for four-year terms, the redistricting did not come fully into effect until after the 2014 election.\n\nThe Senate elects its own president from its membership. Mitch Carmichael is currently the President of the West Virginia Senate.\n\nWhile the West Virginia Constitution does not create or even mention the title of lieutenant governor, West Virginia Code 6A-1-4 creates this designation for the Senate President, who stands first in the line of succession to the office of governor. As stated in Article 7 Section 16 of the constitution: \"In case of the death, conviction or impeachment, failure to qualify, resignation, or other disability of the governor, the president of the Senate shall act as governor until the vacancy is filled, or the disability removed.\" However, the Senate President may not always serve the remainder of the term as the constitution also states: \"Whenever a vacancy shall occur in the office of governor before the first three years of the term shall have expired, a new election for governor shall take place to fill the vacancy.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2192656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192656", "title": "Lawrence Tyson", "text": "Lawrence Tyson\n\nLawrence Davis Tyson (July 4, 1861August 24, 1929) was an American general, politician and textile manufacturer, operating primarily out of Knoxville, Tennessee, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He commanded the 59th Brigade of the 30th Infantry Division during World War I, and served as a Democratic United States Senator from Tennessee from 1925 until his death. Tyson helped organize the Knoxville Cotton Mills in the early 20th century and served as president of the second Appalachian Exposition in 1911.\n\nA graduate of West Point, Tyson first saw military action during the Apache Wars in the 1880s. He moved to Knoxville in 1891 to teach military science at the University of Tennessee, and commanded the 6th Regiment, Tennessee Volunteer Infantry during the Spanish–American War. From 1902 to 1908, Tyson served in the Tennessee House of Representatives, and was Speaker of the House from 1903 to 1905. During the Meuse-Argonne Offensive of World War I, the 59th Brigade, under Tyson's leadership, became one of the first Allied brigades to break through the Hindenburg Line.\n\nTyson was born on the farm of his parents, Richard Lawrence Tyson and Margaret Turnage, near Greenville in Pitt County, North Carolina near the Tar River in the Tidewater region. He graduated from the Greenville Academy, and initially worked as a clerk in Salisbury. In 1878, he scored the highest in his region on a competitive entrance exam for the United States Military Academy at West Point, and was admitted the following year. Upon graduation in 1883, Tyson was commissioned as a second lieutenant, and took part in the Apache Wars against a Geronimo-led faction of Apaches in the West.\n\nIn 1886, Tyson married Bettie Humes McGhee, the daughter of wealthy Knoxville railroad baron Charles McClung McGhee (1828–1907). With his father-in-law's help, Tyson was appointed professor of military science at the University of Tennessee in 1891.\n\nHe also enrolled in the university's law school, from which he graduated in 1894. After his admission to the Tennessee Bar, he resigned his military commission. He began practicing law. At one point, he worked for the law firm of Edward Terry Sanford (1865–1930), future Supreme Court justice.\n\nUpon the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898, Tyson returned to active military duty. Appointed a colonel by President William McKinley, he organized and trained the 6th Regiment U.S. Volunteer Infantry in the Summer of 1898. In October, he and his unit were shipped to Puerto Rico, where they garrisoned the Arecibo area on the northern half of the island. As the war wound down in February 1899, Tyson's unit was ordered to Savannah, Georgia, where they were mustered out a month later. Tyson entered the National Guard reserve units.\n\nBack in Knoxville, Tyson returned to private law practice. He organized the Knoxville Cotton Mills, which would grow to become one of Knoxville's major textile companies in the early 20th century. In 1907, he chaired a conference in Nashville, which called for reform in child labor practices across the South. In December 1910, several dozen children were still working at a Knoxville Cotton Mills factory, as shown in a photograph by National Child Labor Committee photographer Lewis Hine.\n\nTyson's first foray into politics came in 1902, when he was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives. In 1889, the Democrats had gained control of the state legislature and quickly passed four acts which they described as \"electoral reform,\" including literacy tests, grandfather clauses and poll taxes. These resulted in the disfranchisement of most of the African-American voters in the state, as well as many poor white voters. This sharply reduced competitive politics in the state, leading to Democratic dominance.\n\nFrom 1903 to 1905, Tyson served as the elected Speaker of the House. Simultaneously, he served as a brigadier general and inspector general of the Tennessee National Guard, a position he held from 1902 to 1908. In 1913, he made an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate, seeking the Democratic nomination from the state legislature. That year, the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified, providing for popular election of US senators. It generally affected elections for US senators beginning in 1914.\n\nUpon U.S. entry into World War I, Tyson applied to return to active military duty, and was appointed brigadier general over all Tennessee National Guard troops by Governor Tom C. Rye. This commission was subsequently federalized by President Woodrow Wilson. Tyson was assigned to the 59th Brigade, 30th Infantry Division, and helped train the brigade at Camp Sevier near Greenville, South Carolina. The 30th embarked for France in May 1918, and were among the first American troops to enter Belgium in July of that year.\n\nIn September 1918, the 30th Infantry Division was ordered to the Somme area in northern France, and positioned opposite the heavily fortified Cambrai-Saint Quentin Canal section of the Hindenburg Line. On the morning of September 29, the 30th attacked German fortifications along this section of the line. Marching in dense fog, the troops pushed across a stretch of \"wire entanglements and trench defenses\" before crossing the canal and securing the area. According to some reports, the 59th was the first Allied brigade to break through the Hindenburg Line.\n\nIn subsequent weeks, the 59th captured the northern French villages of Prémont, Brancourt, and Busigny, and fought its last action on October 20. In the course of the war, 1,879 of the 59th's 8,000 troops were killed or wounded. The brigade received nine Medals of Honor, the most of any single brigade in World War I. Tyson was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.\n\nIn October 1918, Tyson's son, Charles McGhee Tyson (1889–1918), a Navy pilot, was lost over the North Sea while scouting for mines. After Germany's surrender, Tyson left the front to help search for his son off the coast of Scotland. He located his son's body, and shipped it back to Knoxville for burial. Tyson left active duty for the final time in 1919.\n\nIn 1920, Tyson made an unsuccessful effort to gain the vice presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention. In 1923, he purchased a newspaper, the \"Knoxville Sentinel.\" When he won the popular election to the U.S. Senate the following year, he sold the newspaper to Scripps-Howard. In 1926, Scripps-Howard merged the \"Sentinel\" with the \"Knoxville News\" to form the \"Knoxville News Sentinel\".\n\nIn the early 1920s, the Democratic Party had grown frustrated with Senator John Knight Shields, who had opposed President Woodrow Wilson's League of Nations, and had stalled a number of the Executive Branch's political appointments. Sensing Shields' vulnerability, Tyson ran against and defeated Shields in the Senate Democratic primary in 1924. He defeated Republican candidate, Hugh B. Lindsay, in the general election later that year. He was sworn in as a Senator on March 4, 1925.\n\nTyson's first major piece of legislation was the Tyson-Fitzgerald Act of 1925, which authorized federal compensation for disabled World War I officers. After President Calvin Coolidge vetoed the bill, Tyson rallied enough opposition in the Senate to override the president's veto. In 1926, Tyson sponsored legislation authorizing the creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nTyson died in 1929 at a sanitarium in Strafford, Pennsylvania. He is buried in Old Gray Cemetery in Knoxville. The obelisk marking the Tyson family plot is among the tallest monuments in the cemetery.\n\nIn 1927, Lawrence and Bettie Tyson donated the land for what is now Tyson Park, as well as land for an airstrip (originally in West Knoxville), to the City of Knoxville, asking in return that the city name the airstrip for their son, Charles McGhee Tyson. McGhee Tyson Airport has since been moved to Blount County.\n\n\nIn July 2007, Drew Gilpin Faust, a professor of history, college administrator and a great-granddaughter of Lawrence D. and Bettie Tyson, became Harvard University's 28th president. Her parents were McGhee Tyson and Catherine (Mellick) Gilpin. Her paternal grandmother was Isabella (Tyson) Gilpin, Lawrence and Bettie's daughter.\n\n\n"}

In 1934, he was a political prisoner for some months. In 1944, while serving with the German Wehrmacht in France, he deserted and joined the Maquis, bringing with him four trucks of arms and ammunition and 500,000 francs. When the U.S. Third Army liberated Alsace in September 1944, he gave himself up to them (along with 17 German prisoners). He then went to work for the British Special Operations Executive and, in 1945, he was parachuted back into the Aussee area with three colleagues: Valentin Tarra, Johann Moser and Hans Renner.\n\nThe Germans had pillaged a huge number of European art treasures during the Nazi period, and many had been stored in the Altaussee salt mine near Gaiswinkler's home town of Bad Aussee. After being dropped into the local area, Gaiswinkler raised a force of around 300 men and armed them with captured German weapons. He spent the last weeks and months of the war harassing local German forces. When the Americans arrived, his information helped them capture several eminent Nazis. He and his colleagues had captured the salt mine, prevented the destruction of the artworks held there and were able to hand over \"\"a number of Nazi treasure hoards, including the Mona Lisa and the Austrian Imperial Crown Jewels\"\". Other artworks rescued included the Ghent Altarpiece.\n\nThe administrators of the Louvre have stated that the Mona Lisa was kept in France during the Second World War, but that it is possible that a 15th- or 16th-century copy of the Mona Lisa was held in Austria.\n\nAfter the war, Gaiswinkler was a SPÖ member of the Austrian Parliament from 1945 to 1949.

The central part of the ward includes elevated ground; this area, known as Yamate, has long been a residential area. Along the shore lies reclaimed land upon which port facilities, part of the Minato Mirai 21 complex, and Yamashita Park were built.

Louis-Guillaume's older brother was the astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier.\n\nLouis-Guillaume Le Monnier worked in physics, geology, medicine, and botany. In 1739 he accompanied the expedition of César-François Cassini de Thury and Nicolas Louis de Lacaille to extend the Meridian of Paris and documented mines and the geology and botany along the route. In the same year, he also began working at the hospital of Saint Germain en Laye as a physician. He researched electrical phenomena, sending a current from a Leyden jar through a wire 950 toises (about 1,850 m) long and concluded that electricity propagated \"instantaneously\" in the wire. Later research of his on electrical phenomena was concerned with thunderstorms and the \"fair weather condition\".\n\nLike his father and his brother before him, Louis-Guillaume became a member of the \"Académie des sciences\" on 3 July 1743, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 7 February 1745, of which his brother also was a member. On 30 June 1746, one year after his brother, he also became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.\n\nWith Claude Richard he was one of the original organizers of Louis XV's botanic collection at Petit Trianon, an undertaking quickly joined by Bernard de Jussieu. Lemonnier was appointed professor of botany at the Jardin du Roi (later the Jardin des Plantes) in 1759, filling a spot left by the death of Bernard de Jussieu's brother Antoine in April of the previous year. In 1786 he was succeeded as professor of botany by René Louiche Desfontaines.\n\nFor Diderot's \"Encyclopédie\" he wrote several entries, among them \"Electricité\", \"Magnétisme\", \"Aimant\" (Magnet), and \"Aiguille aimantée\" (Compass needle). After 1759, he stopped publishing, though.

{"id": "2192703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192703", "title": "Alan Stubbs", "text": "Alan Stubbs\n\nAlan Stubbs (born 6 October 1971) is an English football coach and former player who was most recently manager of Scottish Premiership club St Mirren. Stubbs played as a centre-back for Bolton Wanderers, Celtic, Everton (two spells), Sunderland and Derby County until his retirement, due to a knee injury, in August 2008. Stubbs then worked as a coach for Everton, and started his management career with Hibernian in 2014. He led Hibernian to a Scottish Cup victory in 2016, then had a brief tenure at Rotherham United. After working as a pundit for BT Sport, he was appointed St Mirren manager in June 2018.\n\nBorn in Kirkby, Lancashire, Stubbs started his career at Bolton Wanderers, turning professional in 1990 when they were members of the Football League Third Division. He played 23 league games that season but it was a disappointing first season at Burnden Park for Stubbs as his side missed out on automatic promotion on goal difference and were beaten by Tranmere Rovers in the playoff final. He remained a regular player in 1991–92 but this campaign brought further frustration as Bolton finished 13th in the Third Division and manager Phil Neal was dismissed to make way for Bruce Rioch.\n\nStubbs remained part of Rioch's plans as Bolton began 1992–93 in the new Division Two (following the creation of the FA Premier League and the renumbering of the three remaining Football League divisions) and scored twice in 42 league appearances as they sealed promotion as runners-up. He became club captain soon afterwards and in 1994–95 led them through their best season in years where they reached Wembley twice. The first visit to Wembley came in March, where they reached the Football League Cup final for the first time in their history, only to lose 2–1 to Liverpool. The return to Wembley for the Division One playoff final two months later was a happier occasion for Stubbs and his colleagues, though for 75 minutes it looked as though it would be another disappointment as Bolton trailed 2–0 to Reading in the contest for a place in the Premier League. But a remarkable turnaround saw them drawing 2–2 after 90 minutes to force extra time, and they went on to win 4–3 and return to the top flight for the first time since 1980.\n\nBefore the start of the season, Bolton manager Bruce Rioch departed to Arsenal and attempted to bring Stubbs with him, but this was unsuccessful.\n\nStubbs remained with Bolton throughout their 1995–96 campaign, their first in the top flight for 16 years, which was mostly spent in the bottom two places of the table and ended with them being relegated in bottom place.\n\nHe joined Celtic on 10 July 1996 for £4 million, a record signing for Celtic and at the time the second biggest sale for Bolton. The deal became subject of scrutiny from FIFA, who initially fined Celtic £41,000 and Stubbs £28,000 for the use of unlicensed agents during the transfer. These fines were later reduced to £22,000 and £18,000 respectively on appeal.\n\nHis first season at Celtic, 1996–97, saw him play regularly but Stubbs did little to justify his expensive transfer fee as Rangers clinched their ninth successive Scottish League championship.\n\nThe following season (1997–98 season) saw a new manager, Wim Jansen, in charge at Celtic and a new partner in central defence alongside Stubbs, Danish international Marc Rieper. Both these factors saw an upturn in Stubbs' fortunes at Celtic, and his pairing with Rieper in defence made Celtic a much more formidable obstacle to rivals Rangers. After an initial shaky start to the season, Celtic began to find their form and Stubbs picked up his first winner's medal on 30 November 1997 with Celtic beating Dundee United 3–0 in the Scottish League Cup Final.\n\nStubbs is probably best remembered for his injury time goal 11 days earlier (19 November 1997) in a 1–1 draw with Rangers, which kept Rangers lead in the league at the time over Celtic to a recoverable 4 points. Many believe that this was the most important goal of the season for Celtic; they would later go on to overtake Rangers in the league and win the Scottish Premier Division that season, their first league title since 1988, and prevent Rangers from securing a record breaking 10 league titles in a row.\n\nStubbs continued to impress at Celtic with his strong presence in defence, good range of passing and occasional goal. However a routine drug test after the Scottish Cup Final defeat to Rangers in May 1999 revealed Stubbs was suffering from testicular cancer. Stubbs recovered and continued to be a mainstay in the Celtic side, picking up another winner's medal in March 2000 when he came on as a second-half substitute for Ľubomír Moravčík during Celtic's 2–0 win over Aberdeen in the Scottish League Cup Final. Stubbs also played 11 games in their 2000–01 SPL title winning season under new manager Martin O'Neill. However, he missed most of that campaign as he discovered early in the season that the cancer had come back. and had again to undergo treatment. Stubbs later recalled about this in \"Daily Mail\" columns as part of \"\"The Footballers' Column\"\", quoting:\n\nStubbs again recovered from his illness, making his comeback in May 2001 in a league match against Hibernian where he came on as a second-half substitute to a rousing reception from both sets of fans and scored Celtic's fourth goal in a 5–2 win. However, Stubbs wife never truly settled in Scotland and his own battles with cancer saw the family look to make a return home to England.\n\nHe joined Everton in July 2001 after winning his battle against cancer, and after his Celtic contract expired. On his arrival at Goodison Park, Stubbs stated it had always been his dream to play for the club. Stubbs confirmed at the time part of his motive for moving to Everton was that he wanted to return home to his native Merseyside with his wife Mandy.\n\nStubbs quickly became a regular member of the team and excelled during his first season, as Everton finished 15th and reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. Stubbs continued to be a consistent performer in the heart of the Toffees defence during the 2002–03 as he helped them finish seventh in the Premier League (their highest finish since 1996) under new manager David Moyes, and 2003–04, although they dipped to 17th and narrowly avoided relegation in this campaign.\n\nThe 2004–05 season was another successful campaign for Stubbs. Although a shoulder injury kept him out in April, he made 36 appearances, scoring once - in a 2–1 win against Portsmouth. He captained Everton to a 4th-place finish in the league which entered Everton into the qualifying rounds of the Champions League. He was set to continue as a vital part of the squad in 2005–06, but refused to sign a new contract as the club were willing to offer him only a one-year deal, and later revelations suggested a \"cancer clause\" in the contract that Stubbs was unhappy with; claims Everton denied.\n\nStubbs signed for Sunderland on 2 August 2005. Stubbs' final appearance at the Stadium of Light was to be the 3–0 victory over Northwich Victoria in the FA Cup. He scored once for Sunderland, in a 3–1 defeat at Arsenal on 5 November 2005. This was one of the worst seasons in Sunderland's history, as they were relegated with a then record Premier League low of three wins and 15 points.\n\nStubbs returned to Everton on a free transfer on 20 January 2006, signing a contract that was due to last until the end of the season. His form improved dramatically following his return, leading to manager David Moyes referring to him as \"indispensable\" in March.\n\nDespite the arrival of Joleon Lescott that summer, Stubbs maintained his place in starting line up and proved to be a pivotal figure behind Everton's push for a UEFA Cup place.\n\nIn September 2007 after the murder of Rhys Jones, an 11-year-old Everton fan shot dead in Croxteth, Stubbs delivered a reading at his funeral to a packed Liverpool Cathedral including members of Everton and Liverpool.\n\nOn 31 January 2008, Stubbs moved to Derby County in an 18-month deal on a free transfer. Derby's relegation from the Premiership with 11 points meant that Stubbs had been involved in the campaigns of the teams with two lowest points totals attained since the league's inception. On 20 August 2008, just after the start of Derby's 2008–09 Football League Championship campaign, it was announced that a recurring knee injury had forced him to retire from playing football.\n\nStubbs won an England 'B' cap on 10 May 1994 in a match against Northern Ireland 'B' at Hillsborough. England won the match 4–2, with Stubbs coming on during the second half as a substitute for Chris Bart-Williams.\n\nIn September 2008, Stubs returned once more to Everton, this time as a coach, where he was assistant manager of the U21 team for five years, before managing them for one year. In May 2013, Stubbs was interviewed by Bill Kenwright for the vacant manager's role at Everton, but Roberto Martínez was eventually selected to be the team's new manager. Despite this, Stubbs later credited Martínez for inspiring him to become a manager in his own right.\n\nStubbs was appointed head coach of Scottish club Hibernian (Hibs) in June 2014 on a two-year contract, as Terry Butcher's successor after the club had been relegated to the Scottish Championship. This came after Hibs with Everton's permission had opened talks with Stubbs, who believed he was ready to become a manager. In his first press conference, Stubbs announced his aim of helping Hibs win promotion back to the Scottish Premiership by rebuilding the squad ahead of the new season. To do that, Stubbs also recruited his own backroom staff, consisting of assistant coach Andy Holden, player-coach Alan Combe, head physiotherapist John Porteous, strength and conditioning coach Paul Green, and first-team coach John Doolan.\n\nUnder Stubbs' management, Hibs made ten signings, of which four were loan deals. Stubbs' first league match in charge was against Livingston; unusually, the Hibs goalkeeper (Mark Oxley) scored the winning goal. Stubbs guided Hibs to second place in the 2014–15 Scottish Championship, securing the position above Rangers on the last day of the season. Hibs entered the Premiership play offs at the semi-final stage, but lost 2–1 on aggregate to Rangers. Stubbs also guided Hibernian to a semi-final place in the 2014–15 Scottish Cup, where they lost 1–0 against Falkirk. In the 2015-16 season, Hibs initially challenged Rangers for automatic promotion but eventually finished third and lost in the playoffs to Falkirk. Hibs reached both domestic cup finals in 2015–16, losing the League Cup final to Ross County, but winning 3–2 in the Scottish Cup final against Rangers. This was the first time Hibs had won the Scottish Cup for 114 years.\n\nStubbs was appointed manager of EFL Championship club Rotherham United on 1 June 2016. His only win came on 20 August 2016, with Danny Ward scoring the only goal in a 1–0 win over Brentford. However, he was sacked less than two months later on 19 October 2016 following a 4–2 defeat to Birmingham City, and a record seventh straight away loss. Under Stubbs' tenure, Rotherham lost ten of their first fourteen games, winning just once. They also conceded 37 goals during this period, leaving them with the worst goal difference in the entire EFL. Rotherham replaced Alan Stubbs with Kenny Jackett on 21 October 2016.\n\nStubbs was appointed St Mirren manager in June 2018. On 3 September, it was announced that Stubbs had left the club after less than three months in charge.\n\n\nHibernian\n"}

At the same time he was also a second-grade violin student at the State Musical School in Gliwice. His musical education was continued at the Music High School in Katowice and completed with a master's degree in arrangement and composing from the \"Akademia Muzyczna im. K. Szymanowskiego w Katowicach\".\n\nSoyka made his professional debut on stage on November 1978, when he performed at the National Philharmonic Hall in Warsaw in the prestigious \"Jazz at the Philharmonic\" series. He presented a recital, inspired by classic jazz, soul and R&B, including songs by Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, The Beatles and George Gershwin, but also traditional Polish Christmas carols and folklore tunes. The concert was recorded and released in 1979 as Soyka's debut album entitled \"Don't You Cry\". In that year Stanisław Soyka also won the top prize at Lubelskie Spotkania Jazzowe (Lublin Jazz Conference).\n\nIn the next six yeards he released three more jazz albums and one of religious music. He was named the best Polish jazz vocalist by readers of the magazine \"Jazz Forum\", from 1983 to 1988. In the same period Soyka also recorded some pop songs for Polish Radio, which were later collected on the album \"Radioaktywny\", released in 1989.\n\nIn 1986 Soyka signed a two-year record deal with RCA in Germany. There he recorded his first pop and first international album, entitled simply \"Stanisław Sojka\". Among the producers was the famous Harold Faltermeyer. Before the album he also produced Soyka's single \"Spirit of the West\", recorded for an ad campaign for West cigarettes. The album was a commercial flop, but it was a success in his native Poland. In 1988 Soyka came back to Poland and formed a duet with guitarist Janusz Iwański \"Janina\" from the famous Polish jazz group Tie Break. They recorded and performed together until 1994. In 1991 Soyka recorded his most famous and best-selling album, \"Acoustic\", co-produced by Dieter Meier from Yello. It brought hits like \"Cud niepamięci\" and \"Play It Again\". In 1992 he was named the Best Polish Star of 1991 by the readers of \"Popcorn\" magazine for teenagers. His next album \"Neopositive\" from 1992 repeated the commercial success of \"Acoustic\", thanks to the huge hit \"Tolerancja\", which became the biggest of his career. In that year he also won the Bursztynowy Słowik – Grand Prix of Sopot International Song Festival. Another album, \"Radical Graża\" from 1994, was less successful, as were all his subsequent albums.\n\nIn 1995 Soyka decided to compose music for poetry and chose William Shakespeare's sonnets, translated into Polish. The album \"Sonety Shakespeare\" was released in 1995 and his English version \"Soyka Sings Shakespeare's Sonnets\" four years later. Soyka gave the Polish version as a gift to Queen Elizabeth II, during her 1996 visit to Poland. In 2003 he composed music for the poem \"Roman Tryptich\" written by Pope John Paul II and recorded the album \"Tryptyk rzymski\". He presented these songs live in front of the Pope in the Vatican. In 2001 Soyka recorded the last religious album of his career, \"Polskie pieśni wielkopostne\" with forgotten Polish Lenten songs. But Soyka didn't forget about pop music and between those albums released \"Nr 17\" in 1998, \"Soykanova\" in 2002 and album with covers \"Soyka Sings Love Songs\" in 2004. In 2007 he formed his new band Soyka Sextet Plus. In 2008 Soyka recorded as a guest artist two songs with rapper Gorzki, including one with Bizarre from D12 and one reggae song with composer and producer Krakowski. Soyka's first studio album in five years, \"Studio Wąchock\", was released in October 2009.\n\nSoyka has won two Fryderyk Awards: as \"Best Male Vocalist\" of 1994 (on the first ceremony) and for the \"Best Poetic Music Album\" of 2003.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2192712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192712", "title": "Maurice Girodias", "text": "Maurice Girodias\n\nMaurice Girodias (12 April 1919 – 3 July 1990) was a French publisher who was the founder of the Olympia Press. At one time he was the owner of his father's Obelisk Press. He spent most of his productive years in Paris.\n\nGirodias was born Maurice Kahane in Paris, France, the son of Manchester-born Jack Kahane and a French heiress, Marcelle (\"née\" Girodias). His father was Jewish and his mother was Catholic. Girodias lived a relatively idyllic childhood until the Depression forced his father to take up a new profession in Paris, publishing risqué books in English for the consumption of foreign tourists, who because of censorship could not obtain such materials at home. French censorship laws had a loophole allowing English works to be published without domestic confiscation.\n\nKahane's venture (Girodias later took his mother's birth name to hide his partially Jewish background from the Nazis) was called Obelisk Press. It published notorious works by Frank Harris, Henry Miller and Anaïs Nin, as well as several pieces of light erotica written by Kahane himself.\n\nGirodias's involvement with his father's business started early. In 1934, at the age of 15, Girodias drew the disturbing seen on the original cover of \"Tropic of Cancer\". After his father's early death in 1939, Girodias took over publishing duties, and at the age of 20 managed to survive Paris, World War II, Occupation and paper shortages.\n\nAfter the war, with his brother Eric Kahane, Girodias expanded operations, publishing \"Zorba the Greek\" (in French) and Henry Miller's \"Sexus\", among other texts. The latter volume touched off a firestorm in France, with trials and arrests for obscenity. The 'Affaire Miller' ended with Girodias out of jail, but bankrupt and no longer in control of his company.\n\nExpatriate writer Austryn Wainhouse introduced Girodias to a number of writers living in Paris associated with \"Merlin\", a literary review; in order \"to publish books legally in Paris, [\"Merlin\"] needed to demonstrate to the French authorities it had a French business partner.\" Girodias famously advised the group that the way out of poverty was for everyone to come and write dirty books for his new venture Olympia Press, which took its name from the similarity to his father's company, and Manet's famous portrait of a courtesan.\n\nAmong those who wrote for Girodias in the early days were American author Henry Miller, Samuel Beckett, John Glassco and Christopher Logue. Alexander Trocchi, John Stevenson (Marcus Van Heller), Glassco and Logue penned \"db's\" (\"dirty books\") for the Atlantic Library Series, a short-lived line of erotica. Beckett published \"Watt\" and his Malone Trilogy through the more literary Collection Merlin. The South African poet Sinclair Beiles was an editor at Olympia.\n\nAfter several police crackdowns, Girodias shifted his imprints, replacing the Atlantic Library with the Traveller's Companion Series, beginning with \"The Enormous Bed\" by John Coleman. Legal difficulties persuaded Girodias to include less openly erotic and more literary works in the series, and number six, Denny Bryant's \"Tender Was My Flesh\", was followed by \"The Ginger Man\", by J. P. Donleavy.\n\nOther famous titles published in the Traveller's Companion Series were \"Lolita\" by Vladimir Nabokov, \"The Naked Lunch\" by William S. Burroughs, a translation of \"Story of O\" by Pauline Réage, and \"Candy\" by Mason Hoffenberg and Terry Southern.\n\nThe Olympia Press also published \"The S.C.U.M. Manifesto\", which has since been published by other publishers and excerpted.\n\nOther Olympia Press imprints included Ophir Books, Ophelia Press and Othello Books.\n\nGirodias, very much against Donleavy's intention, published \"The Ginger Man\" as pornography. He seemed unable to grasp the literary merit of the work. When he did belatedly understand that he had a brilliant and original book, instead of acknowledging this, he tried to steal the rights from the author. Girodias and Donleavy sued each other back and forth for a period of 20 years following the publication of \"The Ginger Man\". This litigation continued, even after Girodias' bankruptcy, when at auction Donleavy's wife bought the rights to the Olympia Press.\n\nAnalysis of the original manuscript for \"The Ginger Man\" shows, in Donleavy's words, \"a few major blunders and distinctly misplaced paragraphs and an odd misprint here and there, but the work with these exceptions had meticulously followed the manuscript\". Donleavy won almost every case, though it was an expensive ordeal for both parties.\n\nA complicated arrangement accorded the Olympia Press roughly one-third of the royalties for \"Lolita\" after the novel's breakthrough success in America. However, Girodias lost this share when he failed to pay Nabokov on time for the French royalties.\n\nGirodias used to reprint the successful works of some authors under another imprint belonging to him (Ophelia Press) without the knowledge of the respective authors, in order to avoid giving them royalties for new editions. This was one of the main reasons that determined John Stevenson to end the collaboration with Girodias in 1961. In the years 1955–1961, under the pen name Marcus van Heller, Stevenson was the most prolific writer for the \"Traveller's Companion\" series, turning his pen name into a brand of sorts. Afterwards, Girodias used the fact that the real identity behind Marcus van Haller was largely unknown, commissioning other writers to publish new novels under this pen name.\n\nGirodias consistently ran into difficulties with the authorities throughout his career. The Paris police, often pressured by British customs, seized and destroyed many copies of his books. The courts would fine him, and by 1963 he found he had to leave Paris, first for Copenhagen, then for America, where Customs agents destroyed the microfilm copies of numerous TC titles Girodias possessed. He also got into serious trouble with Simon & Schuster and author Irving Wallace over a work called \"The Original Seven Minutes\" by J.J. Jadway. Copies of Girodias' Olympia Press title had to be destroyed before reaching the bookstores.\n\nHis books were published in the United States under the Olympia Press, Traveller's Companion and Ophelia Press imprints. After acquiring the Venus Library name from Kable News, who had taken it from Barney Rosset's Grove Press in settlement of debts, Girodias published also under the Venus Freeway imprint, with distribution being handled by Kable News.\n\nHis erotic and hardcore pornographic books were published also in the United Kingdom, in West Germany, Denmark and in The Netherlands under the Olympia Press imprint. The first British edition of \"Story of O\" by Pauline Réage was published by Olympia Press.\n\"In 1964, Girodias was prosecuted for publishing obscene literature. He was sentenced on March 3 to a year in jail, banned from publishing for twenty years, and received a $20,000 fine. It was the most serious penalty ever imposed on a publisher for offenses listed \"outrage aux moeurs par la voie du livre\". Girodias was probably ruined because of collusion amongst French, American, and British authorities ... As a result, Girodias lost everything and was ruined.\"\nIn 1974 Girodias published \"President Kissinger\" using the Venus Freeway imprint, a controversial work of science fiction by numerous authors offering a dream of socialism starring Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Girodias, it is said, was set up by the authorities in a phony drug deal and invited to leave the country.\n\nGirodias tended not to pay his writers, if he could avoid it, not to document his work, or even live up to his contracts. He was involved in litigation concerning \"Lolita\", \"Candy\", \"The Ginger Man\", \"Stradella\" and \"O\", among other works. In the cases of \"Candy\" and \"O\", Girodias won, setting a great deal of copyright precedents. In the cases of \"Lolita\" and \"The Ginger Man\", he lost.\n\nOn 3 July 1990, Girodias died of a heart attack. He was 71.\n\n"}
{"id": "2192715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192715", "title": "Achuar", "text": "Achuar\n\nThe Achuar are an Amazonian community of some 18,500 individuals along either side of the border in between Ecuador and Peru. As of the early 1970s, the Achuar were one of the last of the Jivaroan groups still generally unaffected by outside contact.\n\nThe name Achuar means “the people of the aguaje palm”.\n\nAchuar life centers on the domestic household, which consists of a basic family unit often including close relatives. Although the Achuar ideal is household autonomy and independence in terms of subsistence economy, there are usually about ten to fifteen households within the society dispersed throughout the area but still in a relatively close distance of each other. Each of these groupings tends to be uxorilocal. Marriages are typically polygynous, with partners somewhat related, or in some instances women are taken from nearby groups during raids. Co-wives are often sisters (see sororal polygyny).\n\nThe standard Achuar home is settled near a river or lake, but at some distance from major waterways because of mosquitoes and to protect the household against raids by canoe. It is shaped as a large oval, commonly without outer walls to allow ventilation, with a high roof with straight sides. The roof is often made out of palm tree fronds while two types of palm are used for house beams. Temporary walls are made out of large palms when danger seems close. A large yard and gardens then surround the home on the outside. The size of a house plays a pivotal part in the ego of an Achuar man. The bigger the house is to fit multiple wives and children the more likely that man will be considered a \"juunt\", or \"great man\".\n\nConflicts within the Achuar society are minimal. The constant fight is between neighboring tribes and when tensions greatly increase, the Achuar find refuge in large protected houses that hold six to seven families.\n\nWomen and men hold separate daily tasks that are all beneficial for the survival of a family. The women gather and carry the game, sometimes with their children, while also preparing meals. They also have the opportunity to fish with baskets or with lines but overall their role pertains to domestic duties. Men, on the other hand, work in the forest and hunt. They are also involved in making the tools they use for hunting, like blowguns and traps, and use the technique of clearing for the expansion of their spouses’ gardens.\n\nGardens are maintained solely by women, at least three days a week. They comprise a large quantity and variety of plant species, but their value delves much deeper than just a source of food. Women can find sanctuary in their gardens and express their grief and suffering in private, as public emotion is spurned. Women also give birth to their children in there, demonstrating the importance of gardens in Achuar lives.\n\nThe Achuar follow an astronomical calendar of seasonal resources, like the fish season, which is divided into days, moons, and year.\n\nAside from the everyday routine, there still remains time for leisure. Thirty-five percent of the day is spent on subsistence production, leaving the rest of the day open. Men and young boys have more time for relaxation compared to women who still have house chores to complete. Before being married, young boys do nothing all day while adolescent girls work in the garden. During the rest of the day, married men drink manioc beer and talk amongst each other while also doing handiwork, for example woodwork.\n\nThe ethnic group Achuar forms part of the conjunction of the Shuar and form one of the four dialect groups that constitute the linguistic family of the Shuar (Achuar, Shuar, Aguaruna y Huambisa).\n\nThe Achuar speak a Shuar language and Achuar-Shiwiar language, dialects of the Jivaroan languages. Achuar Chicham or Achuar are related to other languages such as Shuar Chicham but they differ greatly with the Awajunt language (except for some words and phrases). For this reason, some researchers believe they are not from the Jivaroana family. In the Achuar language, there are only four vowels: a, e, i, u. The 'e' is pronounced differently. The alphabet consists of 21 letters a, aa, ch, e, ee, i, ii, j, k, m, n, p, r, s, sh, t, ts, u, uu, w, y.\n\nShamanism is present in Achuar lifestyle and witchcraft is occasionally practiced by both ritual specialists and laypersons. An example of this is an institutionalized form of reciprocal violence that entitles a person to revert any harmful incidents or material another sent. Jivaroans, of which the Achuar are a sub-group, ascribe to a particular form of the pan-Amazonian animistic cosmological phenomenon known as 'Amazonian perspectivism,' in which many animals and plants are understood to possess human souls, although their bodily appearance is different. Animals with human souls are significant for the Achuar, as they represent a form of socialized nature. The only way for a hunter to be successful is to live in harmony with the game he hunts and with its guardian spirits, known as \"kuntiniu nukuri\" (literally: \"game mothers\"). The hunter's relationship with both the prey and their \"game mothers\" is personal and cultivated over a lifetime, and these relationships are characterized principally as affinal. He must follow these two rules: taking these animals with moderation and showing respect to the animals he kills. Both of these rules of hunting are codified in cautionary myths.\n\nThe Achuar believe that entities possessing human souls have the ability to communicate through language and signs. This is sometimes experienced during soul journeys, known as \"arutam\" encounters, which represent an extreme state of self-awareness and are induced by the consumption of hallucinogenic drink. Ayahuasca is a ritual sacrament in Achuar religion. Dreams are essential for the Achuar as they are not only revealing, but also can be foretelling. Prior to engaging in any form of predatory behavior, whether warfare, hunting, or some forms of fishing, men often insist upon having a dream.\n\nSelf-control is a fundamental aspect of Achuar beliefs, which is taught at a young age. Men exercise discipline to show will power and strength and the best place to display this is in their own home. Examples of self-control would be avoiding gluttony, being able to go without sleep, and not wasting anything. As well, another form of control would be over their expressions and attitudes, especially in front of visitors. Evading eye contact is key or else a sense of aggression might arise and mouths are covered when speaking. Saliva is the only product of the body that is publicly exposed. This is because female saliva is believed to be a source of fermentation of the manioc beer and male saliva is socially incorporated into the speech of a conversation.\n\nGardens are watched over by the spirit of gardens, Nunkui. Women sing \"anents\", magical songs, as a medium to communicate with their plants, Nunkui, and other particular objects. The songs are extremely personal so they are either sung in the head or on an instrument, but always in secret. Each anent has basically the same melodic structure but different lyrics. Yet gardens can also be perilous at times, specifically manioc which is believed to have traits of vampirism. Children are the main targets of the manioc and thus are not allowed to enter a garden without supervision. Blood is precious in the eyes of the Achuar who believe there is a finite amount of blood in each person and when lost it can never be replaced, therefore quickening death.\n\nThe traditional form of burial for the Achuar is placing the deceased person in a hollowed-out log, resembling a canoe. During the funeral of a head of household, the canoe is buried in the middle of the house in remembrance of the continuing presence of the late figure. One spiritual belief of the Achuar regarding death, is the role of the remaining body parts of the dead body. These limbs acquire a life of their own and assume the bodies of certain animals.\n\nAchuar were first written about by Western people in 1548; however, they avoided prolonged European contact until the 20th century. Christian missionaries did not gain a foothold in Achuar society until the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nDue to the development of the Amazon Rainforest the Achuar people's numbers and livelihood has been declining. When oil was discovered in the Amazon in 1964 oil companies began to make claims on land for development and profit. Such claims, their development, and a history of violent attacks on oil investment installations throughout the Amazon have resulted in the Achuar being excluded from a portion of operational & drilling areas in the territory traditionally claimed by the Achuar. Non-Indigenous contact has also seen introduction of new diseases (including new STDs) and conflict related to pollution from oil spills, improper business practices, and violent interactions.\n\nIn multiple but not all cases, oil spills of various degrees have been inadequately remediated by simple burial. Major oil pipelines run above rivers that the Achuar depend on for bathing and drinking. When these oil pipelines break, pollution can and has occurred, thereby degrading the resource and limiting Achuar access to their historic fresh (but untreated) water sources. Violent conflicts with non-Indigenous people have arisen between oil company employees and the native Achuar. As in much of the Amazon Basin, indigenous sexual practices differ from those in non-Indigenous populations, and modern \"safe sex\" practices are very poorly disseminated thereby putting at risk their population and culture. As a consequence, some advocates claim that non-Indigenous contact contributes to a majority of indigenous deaths.\n\n\n\n"}

Seventeen of the dead were residents of Gilo.\n\nOn the morning of June 18, 2002, at 7:50 a.m., a Palestinian suicide bomber from Bethlehem got onto the Egged line 32A bus, which came from the Gilo neighborhood and stopped at Beit Safafa, an Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem. The bomber boarded the bus and exploded himself in the front. His explosive belt included metal balls for shrapnel in order to maximize casualties.\n\nPalestinian Islamist group Hamas claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack. The suicide bomber was identified as Muhammad al-Ghoul, a 22-year-old student at An-Najah National University in Nablus. He strapped explosives packed with nails to his body and boarded the bus during the morning rush hour as schoolchildren and commuters travelled to downtown Jerusalem from Gilo. The explosion lifted the bus off the ground, tore off its roof and sent bodies flying through the windows. Two residents of the East Jerusalem suburb of Jabel Mukaber were tried and convicted for transporting a suicide bomber.\n\nThe charred remains of the bus were shipped to America and displayed at the biannual Jewish Expo fair in New York at the initiative of Zaka, an Israeli rescue and body parts recovery organization whose volunteers scrape up fragments of blood and flesh from bomb scenes for burial in keeping with Jewish law. Zaka said its aim was to increase awareness of its work and show the effects of suicide bombings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2192729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192729", "title": "G7e torpedo", "text": "G7e torpedo\n\nThe G7e or more appropriately the G7e/T2, G7e/T3, and G7e/T4 Falke torpedoes were, with the exception of the T4 model, the standard torpedoes for Germany during World War II. All of the G7e models shared standardized dimensions for all German torpedoes designed for use by U-boats during World War II, they measured 53.3 cm (21 inches) in diameter and 7.16 m in length. The warhead was 280 kg of \"Schießwolle 36\", a mixture of dipicrylamine and TNT. All were powered by 100 hp (75 kW) electric motors and lead-acid batteries which required onboard maintenance to maintain their functionality.\n\nThe T2 model of the G7e went in service with German U-boat fleets in 1936. Its existence was virtually unknown to the British until fragments of one torpedo were recovered following the sinking of the Royal Oak in October 1939. The advantages of the G7e in contrast to the G7a steam-driven torpedo, rested in its simplicity and cheapness of manufacture, (half the cost) and the T2 was virtually silent, left no visible trail of bubbles to alert ships that they were under attack. However, in all other respects, the T2 was less reliable and performed unpredictably compared to the G7a. It has no setting (for contact or magnetic detonation) beyond fixed range of 5,000m and ran much slower at . Additionally, the batteries of these torpedoes needed to be preheated to a temperature of 30 °C (85 °F) to operate with maximum speed and range, though generally this was a non-issue as U-boats had the element of surprise and often had the advantage of firing the first shot.\n\nPoor range and speed were not the T2's only problems. Both the contact and magnetic detonators were unreliable, a major flaw that also the United States Navy's standard Mark 14 anti-submarine and anti-ship torpedo had to struggle with. The magnetic influence exploder, designed to allow the torpedo to run under the keel of a ship and detonate, breaking the ship's back, was inconsistent and would often detonate prematurely, or not at all. This led the BdU to order that all G7e/T2 torpedoes be fired only for contact detonation. However, the contact pistol of the T2 also proved to be unreliable; the British battleship HMS \"Nelson\" managed to survive almost certain destruction when three torpedoes from struck on her keel, two broke upon hitting and the other failed to explode.\n\nThese technical defects lead to the circumstance that attacks on at least one battleship, seven heavy cruisers, seven destroyers and some cargo ships were not successful.\n\nNevertheless, the German Navy, after much prodding by German U-boat Command (BdU), invested resources into correcting the T2's flaws. Gradually, it improved, and by the end of the Norwegian Campaign problems with the contact exploder and depth-keeping gear had been mostly solved, with significant strides made in improving the magnetic proximity feature. At the same time, the T2's range was increased from 5,000m to 7,500 m. By that time, however, the T2 was already being phased out of production.\n\nImprovements in the design of the G7e/T2 were incorporated into the production of the next model of electric torpedo for Germany's U-boat fleet. Introduced in 1942, the T3 represented a vast improvement over the early T2. The faulty exploders from the T2 were scrapped in favor of a new design.\n\nThe T3 had a range of 7,500 m and could achieve 30 kt. With the improved design of the T3 and the new exploder, the G7a steam torpedo was totally superseded and was rarely used for the remainder of the war. Using the T3's perfected proximity feature, U-boat captains could effectively fire under the keel of a ship and break the back of their targets with a single torpedo, increasing the overall effectiveness of the U-boat fleet. The T3 could be fitted with both the FaT (\"Flächenabsuchender Torpedo\") and LuT (\"Lagenunabhängiger Torpedo\") pattern running systems for convoy attacks.\n\nThough many opportunities had been missed due to the defects of the T2 torpedo, with the new T3 U-boats were deadlier than ever.\n\nThe T4 Model was the adjunct of the earlier T3 model in nearly every way. The T4 was not an ordinary straight-running torpedo, it ran at 20 kt (37 km/h) for 7500 m and it might, depending on the exact date, have been the world's first acoustic homing torpedo in Naval service, since it was introduced in March 1943, the same month and year as the American Mk-24 \"Mine\" acoustic homing torpedo.\n\nEarly in 1933 Germany started development and testing of acoustic homing mechanisms for torpedoes. From the outset of submarine warfare, submariners had dreamed of being able to aim and fire torpedoes without surfacing or using a periscope. The periscope gives away the location of a submarine, and a hull-penetrating periscope greatly weakens a submarine's pressure hull and limits the depths to which it can dive. U-boats also had to come to very shallow depths to use their periscopes, generally about 15 m, leaving them greatly exposed to bombing, depth charging, and even gunfire.\n\nWith the introduction of \"Falke\", U-boats could remain more deeply submerged and fire at convoys with nothing to give away their position but the noise of their screws. Rather than aiming with a periscope, the torpedo could be roughly aimed at a sound contact as detected by a U-boat's hydrophones, and the homing mechanism could be trusted to find the target without the need for precise aiming.\n\n\"Falke\" worked much like a normal straight-running torpedo for the first 400 m of its run, after which its acoustic sensors became active and searched for a target. The sensitive sound-sensing equipment in \"Falke\" required the torpedo be as quiet as possible, hence it ran at only ; in addition, the firing U-boat was forced to stop its motors. \"Falke\" was intended to home on merchant targets, however, so its slow speed was not a great hindrance.\n\nOnly known to have been fired in action by three U-boats, , and , although regarded as successful, resulting in the sinking of several merchants, and its performance rated satisfactory, \"Falke\" was rapidly phased out of service. It was replaced by the G7es/T5 \"\"Zaunkönig\"\" (referred to by the Allies as GNAT, for German Navy Acoustic Torpedo), which was faster and better able to home onto the sound of fast moving warships as well as merchant traffic.\n\nThough its period of operational service was brief, \"Falke\" was a proof of concept for the acoustic homing torpedo. Its introduction occurred only two months before the U.S. Navy achieved its initial combat success with the Mark 24 FIDO \"mine.\" FIDO was not a mine, but a passive, acoustic-homing torpedo designed for use by long-range patrol aircraft. The initial success with the Mark 24 occurred on 14 May 1943, when a PBY-5 from VP-84 sank with the new weapon. Most sources indicate that the Germans' first combat success with the \"Zaunkönig\" (GNAT) did not occur until September 1943. While the Allies became aware in September 1943 that the Germans had brought GNAT into operational service, it was not until the capture of in June 1944 that they obtained reliable data on the German homing torpedo.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2192733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192733", "title": "American Tract Society", "text": "American Tract Society\n\nThe American Tract Society (ATS) is a nonprofit, nonsectarian but evangelical organization founded on May 11, 1825, in New York City for the purpose of publishing and disseminating tracts of Christian literature. ATS traces its lineage back through the New York Tract Society (1812) and the New England Tract Society (1814) to the Religious Tract Society of London, begun in 1799. Over the years, ATS has produced and distributed many millions of pieces of literature. There is a printed pamphlet titled \"Constitution of the American Tract Society, instituted in Boston 1814\" referencing the distribution of 'Religious Tracts' by Christians in Europe and America during the previous twenty years. The purpose of which was to combine the energy & activities of various groups & individuals across New England.\n\nATS is theologically conservative. It receives funding through a combination of private donations and tract sales. ATS accepts donations to fund tract and evangelistic resource distribution including start-up funding for foreign tract distribution in regions including Africa, Asia, India, South and Central America, Canada, Australia, and Europe. Churches and other evangelistic groups in the United States can purchase ATS literature at nominal cost for use in their own evangelistic ministries.\n\nATS is board-governed and benefits from the visibility of its Council of Reference, an advisory board of evangelical notables from business, ministry, and other walks of life. ATS is currently headquartered in Garland, Texas.\n\nOn September 1, 2012, American Tract Society entered into a joint publishing agreement with Good News Publishing, which is a division of Crossway.\n\nBefore ATS was founded, the Bible was the only religious book being distributed widely around the United States. The American Tract Society's founders felt that the American Bible Society was limited in its activities, leading to ATS's establishment. ATS was created from a merger of the New York Religious Tract Society, founded 1812, and New England Religious Tract Society, founded 1814. William Allen Hallock helped the New England Religious Tract Society change its name to the American Tract Society in 1823. The New England society surrendered that name to a national society proposed by the New York society, which was formed on May 10, 1825. The separate tract societies merged and moved into a four-story building at 87 Nassau Street in New York City. The numbering of that house was revised over the years, changing to 144 Nassau Street in 1827 and 150 Nassau Street by 1833. A new tract house was built on the same site in 1846-1847.\n\nUpon ATS's 1825 creation, it became the first organization in the U.S. formed specifically to give out religious tracts. Hallock subsequently served as the organization's secretary from 1825 to 1870, and as secretary emeritus until his death in 1880. Sampson Uryling Stoddard Wilder was the first president, serving until 1842, and Moses Allen was the first treasurer, serving until 1863. The organization was dependent on endowments and financial contributions from wealthy backers. It was successful, printing out 700,000 tracts in its first year and 5 million tracts per year by 1850, with branches in multiple American cities. ATS took advantage of the population's growing literacy, distributing tracts to immigrants, Native Americans and freed slaves. In 1894, ATS built its 23-story American Tract Society Building at 150 Nassau Street, which still stands today. At the time of its construction it was one of the tallest buildings in New York City.\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century, ATS used traveling salesmen. These peddlers sold tracts, provided counseling, and led church services.\n\nThe American Tract Society has disseminated Christian tracts for over 185 years, and believes its mission and message are as relevant today as when it was formed in 1825.\n\nIn 1978, ATS relocated its headquarters from New York to Garland, Texas. The move came about as a result of the growing number of churches and ministries purchasing ATS literature in Texas. The leaders of American Tract Society also discovered that it would be cost effective to have the ATS office in Texas.\n\nThe ever-increasing advances in technology and social media present both challenges and opportunities for ATS in disseminating its message. Over the years ATS has developed a number of ways to present the gospel in a relevant and timely manner. ATS continues to develop new tools to communicate Christian teachings to the next generation.\n\nThrough its international division (International Tract Society) ATS has approximately 136 print partners in 70 countries who print and distribute tracts in over 100 languages. The goal is to provide ATS print partners with the necessary resources and funding to print and distribute evangelism tools among disadvantaged churches and evangelists worldwide.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2192747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192747", "title": "Five Families", "text": "Five Families\n\nThe Five Families are the five major New York City organized crime families of the Italian American Mafia, formed in 1931 by Salvatore Maranzano following his victory in the Castellammarese War.\n\nMaranzano reorganized the Italian American gangs in New York City into the Maranzano, Profaci, Mangano, Luciano, and Gagliano families, which are now known as the Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese, and Lucchese families. Each family had a demarcated territory, an organizationally structured hierarchy, and having each family report up to the same overarching governing entity. Initially, Maranzano intended each family's boss to report to him as the \"capo di tutti i capi\" (\"boss of all bosses\"). However, this led to his assassination that September, and the role was replaced by The Commission, a ruling committee to oversee all Mafia activities in the United States and serve to mediate conflicts between families, consisting of the bosses of the Five Families, as well as the bosses of the Chicago Outfit and the Buffalo crime family. In 1963, Joseph Valachi publicly disclosed the existence of New York City's Five Families at the Valachi hearings. Since then, a few other crime families have been able to become powerful or notable enough to rise to a level comparable or close to that of the Five Families, holding or sharing the unofficial designation of Sixth Family.\n\nIn the 1920s, Mafia operations in the U.S. were controlled by Giuseppe \"Joe The Boss\" Masseria, whose faction consisted mainly of gangsters from Sicily and the Calabria and Campania regions of Southern Italy. Masseria's faction included Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano, Albert \"Mad Hatter\" Anastasia, Vito Genovese, Alfred Mineo, Willie Moretti, Joe Adonis, and Frank Costello. However, powerful Sicilian \"mafioso\" Don Vito Ferro decided to make a bid for control of Mafia operations. From his base in Castellammare del Golfo, he sent Salvatore Maranzano to seize control. The Castellammarese faction in the U.S. included Joseph \"Joe Bananas\" Bonanno, Stefano \"The Undertaker\" Magaddino, Joseph Profaci, and Joe Aiello. As it became more and more evident that the two factions would clash for leadership of the Mafia, they each sought to recruit more followers to support them.\n\nOutwardly, the Castellammarese War was between the forces of Masseria and Maranzano. Underneath, however, there was also a generational conflict between the old guard Sicilian leadership known as the \"Mustache Petes\" for their long mustaches and old-world ways, such as refusing to do business with non-Italians and the \"Young Turks\", a younger and more diverse Italian group who were more forward thinking and willing to work more with non-Italians. This approach led his followers to question whether Masseria was even capable of making the Mafia prosper in the modern times. Led by Luciano, the aim of this group was to end the war as soon as possible in order to resume their businesses, because they viewed the conflict as unnecessary. Luciano's objective was to modernize the mob and do away with unnecessary orthodox norms. This was a vision that enabled him to attract followers, who had seen the inadequacies of Masseria's traditionalist leadership. Therefore, both factions were fluid, with many mobsters switching sides or killing their own allies during the war. Tensions between the Maranzano and Masseria factions were evident as far back as 1928, with one side frequently hijacking the other's alcohol trucks (alcohol production was then illegal in the United States due to Prohibition).\n\nIn early 1931, Luciano decided to eliminate Masseria. The war had been going poorly for Masseria, and Luciano saw an opportunity to switch allegiance. In a secret deal with Maranzano, Luciano agreed to engineer Masseria's death in return for receiving Masseria's rackets and becoming Maranzano's second-in-command. Joe Adonis had joined the Masseria faction and when Masseria heard about Luciano's betrayal, he approached Adonis about killing Luciano. However, Adonis instead warned Luciano about the murder plot. On April 15, 1931, Masseria was killed at Nuova Villa Tammaro, a Coney Island restaurant in Brooklyn. While they played cards, Luciano allegedly excused himself to the bathroom, with the gunmen reportedly being Anastasia, Genovese, Adonis, and Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel; Ciro \"The Artichoke King\" Terranova drove the getaway car, but legend has it that he was too shaken up to drive away and had to be shoved out of the driver's seat by Siegel. With Maranzano's blessing, Luciano took over Masseria's gang and became Maranzano's lieutenant, ending the Castellammarese War.\n\nWith Masseria gone, Maranzano reorganized the Italian American gangs in New York City into the Five Families headed by Luciano, Profaci, Gagliano, Mangano and himself. Maranzano called a meeting of crime bosses in Wappingers Falls, New York, where he declared himself \"capo di tutti i capi\" (\"boss of all bosses\"). Maranzano also whittled down the rival families' rackets in favor of his own. Luciano appeared to accept these changes, but was merely biding his time before removing Maranzano. Although Maranzano was slightly more forward-thinking than Masseria, Luciano had come to believe that Maranzano was even more greedy and hidebound than Masseria had been.\n\nBy September 1931, Maranzano realized Luciano was a threat, and hired Vincent \"Mad Dog\" Coll, an Irish gangster, to kill him. However, Lucchese alerted Luciano that he was marked for death. On September 10, Maranzano ordered Luciano, Genovese and Costello to come to his office at the 230 Park Avenue in Manhattan. Convinced that Maranzano planned to murder them, Luciano decided to act first. He sent to Maranzano's office four Jewish gangsters whose faces were unknown to Maranzano's people. They had been secured with the aid of Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel. Disguised as government agents, two of the gangsters disarmed Maranzano's bodyguards. The other two, aided by Lucchese, who was there to point Maranzano out, stabbed the boss multiple times before shooting him. This assassination was the first of what would later be fabled as the \"Night of the Sicilian Vespers.\"\n\nAfter Maranzano's murder in 1931, Luciano called a meeting in Chicago. Although there would have been few objections had Luciano declared himself \"capo di tutti i capi,\" he abolished the title, believing the position created trouble between the families and made himself a target for another ambitious challenger. Luciano's goals with the Commission were to quietly maintain his own power over all the families, and to prevent future gang wars; the bosses approved the idea of the Commission. The Commission would consist of a \"board of directors\" to oversee all Mafia activities in the United States and serve to mediate conflicts between families.\n\nThe Commission consisted of seven family bosses: the leaders of New York's Five Families: Charlie \"Lucky\" Luciano, Vincent Mangano, Tommy Gagliano, Joseph Bonanno, and Joe Profaci; Chicago Outfit boss Al Capone; and Buffalo family boss Stefano Magaddino. Charlie Luciano was appointed chairman of the Commission. The Commission agreed to hold meetings every five years or when they needed to discuss family problems.\n\nIn 1963, Joseph Valachi publicly disclosed the existence of New York City's Five Families at the Valachi hearings. According to Valachi, the original bosses of the Five Families were Charles Luciano, Tommaso Gagliano, Joseph Profaci, Salvatore Maranzano and Vincent Mangano. At the time of his testimony in 1963, Valachi revealed that the current bosses of the Five Families were Tommy Lucchese, Vito Genovese, Joseph Colombo, Carlo Gambino, and Joe Bonanno. These have since been the names most commonly used to refer to the New York Five Families, despite years of overturn and changing bosses in each.\n\nThe crime families historically operated throughout the New York Metropolitan area, but mainly within New York City. In the state of New York, the gangs have increased their criminal rackets on Long Island (Nassau and Suffolk) and the counties of Westchester, Rockland, and Albany. They also maintain a strong presence in the state of New Jersey. The Five Families are also active in South Florida, Connecticut, Las Vegas, and Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactual and fictional details of the history of the crime families have been used in a vast array of media, such as:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2192755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192755", "title": "Nantlle Valley", "text": "Nantlle Valley\n\nThe Nantlle Valley (, ) is an area in Gwynedd, north Wales, characterised by its numerous small settlements.\n\nThe area is also historically important geologically, and featured in one of the most contentious disputes of the 19th century, between the 'Diluvialists' who believed in the Biblical flood, and the ‘Glacialists’, who supported the Glacial Theory, which was substantially established by studies of the drift sediments on Moel Tryfan.\n\nBetween 85-90% of the population of the Nantlle Valley speak Welsh as their first language. \n\nSome of the communities came into being as a result of slate quarrying in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries and some have a history stretching back to antiquity. There are Iron Age forts at Caer Engan in Pen-y-groes and on the coast at Dinas Dinlle and evidence of Bronze Age settlement on the higher ground. The valley was important during the Middle Ages - with a \"clas\" or ecclesiastical college developed at Clynnog Fawr. \n\nThe Glynllifon estate can trace its foundation historically to the 8th century and there is evidence of occupation on the site going back to the Iron Age.\nThere were a number of quarries in the valley, the largest being the Dorothea and Pen yr Orsedd quarries. Although the major quarries are worked out, there remains demand for slate waste for garden decoration.\n\nIn 1991, \"Antur Nantlle Cyf\" was established as a community enterprise to work for the benefit of the Nantlle Valley and its surrounding area.\n\nDyffryn Nantlle was one of the major slate quarrying regions of Wales during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, having at least 37 operating slate quarries at one given time. It was an innovative region in the development of the slate industry. The Cilgwyn quarry on the north side of the valley is the oldest in Wales and one of the oldest in Europe, dating from the 12th century. \n\nThe first steam engine to be used in the slate industry was a pump installed at the Hafodlas quarry in the valley in 1807. Slate roofing tiles have been excavated at Segontium Roman camp in Caernarfon and are thought to have originated in the Nantlle Valley. The quarries of the area are being considered as a World Heritage site.\n\nUnlike most of the other slate producing regions in Wales the Nantlle Valley developed a large number of small, independent quarries because most of the land in the valley was owned by a number of small landowners rather than a single large landowner. At the height of the industry there were over 50 quarries being worked in the valley. \n\nDue to this the quarries were never managed as a large single concern as they were in the Penrhyn, Dinorwic and the Festiniog area quarries and this led to the industry in the area being much more vulnerable to any downturns in the economy. This also led to the development of an industrial landscape that is quite different from the other slate quarrying regions in that there are a large number of small waste slate heaps around the valley.\n\nThere were considerable difficulties involved in raising slate from the pits and in keeping them free from water, and the ingenious ways which were found to solve these problems, including blondins, chain inclines and vast revetments, are some of the principal reasons why the slate quarrying remains in this area, many of which are unique, are so important. Some of the principal features include the 1906 Cornish beam-engine at Dorothea, a unique survival in Wales, the mill and a number of pyramids, also unique, and the blondins at Pen-yr-Orsedd quarry.\n\nOriginally there were two lakes on the valley floor but one has now disappeared and the water is largely contained by the Dorothea quarry pit.\n\nA dispute between local crofter-quarrymen and the local large landowner, Lord Newborough of the Wynn family from Glynllifon became an important legal landmark in the early 19th century. In 1823, Lord Newborough tried to have a law passed to give him control of all the Moel Tryfan Commons, including recent encroachments, and to extinguish the rights of common use. This move was met with fearsome opposition, not least from one John Evans who was concerned that enclosure around the Cilgwyn quarries would affect his own interests, particularly over a dam and watercourse that he had constructed on Crown land in 1816. \n\nEvans organised a commoners’ petition against the Bill, with seven hundred signatures. The petitioners claimed that their cottages had been built over forty years earlier, that originally the land had been too wild for cultivation, and that they had improved it by hard work. This led to a change in the land enclosure law in the United Kingdom.\n\nAnother dispute much celebrated in the area took place a generation later centred on the largest quarry in the valley. Dorothea Quarry was bought in 1835 by an Englishman called Muskett. He spent heavily on new equipment to raise the wagons from the quarry bottom. But he overspent, and was declared bankrupt a few years later. The quarry was closed with three months wages owing to most of the workers. They consequently revolted and demolished the new house Muskett had built for himself - Plas y Cilgwyn.\n\nThe horse-drawn gauge Nantlle Railway served the quarries from 1828 to 1963, although from 1865 the line was cut back to Tyddyn Bengam, and in 1871 only the portion from the standard gauge railhead at Nantlle railway station in Talysarn was in use. The Nantlle railway has a long history as an industrial and passenger line. \n\nThe line received its Act of Parliament in 1825 and was constructed under the supervision of Robert Stephenson, brother of George Stephenson. It opened in 1828 and was operated using horse power. Although built mainly for the transport of slate, the line is known to have carried passengers at various times between Caernarfon and Pen-y-groes. \n\nIt is the last recorded use of horses by British Railways, and closed only with the closure of the branch line to which it connected after the Beeching Review in 1963.\n\nThe Nantlle Valley is famous within Wales for being the main setting of the Fourth branch of the Mabinogion, \"Math fab Manawydan\", the story of Lleu Llaw Gyffes, Blodeuwedd and Gwydion. The story is set mainly in the area with Gwydion finding Lleu transfigured into an eagle in an oak tree at Baladeulyn (the ground that used to exist between the two lakes before industrialisation). There are numerous references to the valley in the Welsh Triads (\"Trioedd Ynys Prydain\") as well.\n\nThe valley was noted for its woodlands and was an important area in the Middle Ages, being used as a hunting park for the royal family of Gwynedd. After the Edwardian conquest in 1282, one of the first recorded jousts in Britain was held on the fields of Baladeulyn near the village of Nantlle as the royal entourage made its way from Nefyn after the war. Rules were apparently drawn up here which later were the basis of the 1292 Statute of Arms issued by Edward I to regulate jousting. \n\nThe area is also famous for the variety, breadth and amount of folk-lore associated with fairies, right up until the present times. This lore was recorded extensively by John Owen Huws in the 1970s and 1980s and published in his landmark three-volume work \"Straeon Gwerin Ardal Eryri\" (Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, 2008).\n\nThe Nantlle Valley also became one of the power-houses of Welsh literature during the 20th century. Notable examples include the poetsT.H. Parry-Williams from Rhyd Ddu and R. Williams Parry from Talysarn. Mathonwy Hughes, from Mynydd Cymffyrch, and Gwilym R. Jones, from Talysarn, grew up in the valley, as did the modern dramatist John Gwilym Jones (of Y Groeslon) and the novelist Kate Roberts (Rhosgadfan) also grew up there. Prolific author of children's and young adult novels J. Selwyn Lloyd was born near Talysarn. Angharad Tomos, author and children's author from Llanwnda, also attended the local secondary school and now lives in Pen-y-groes, as does the American-born Welsh-speaking author Professor Jerry Hunter.\n\nWorld renowned opera singer Bryn Terfel grew up in Pant Glas, on the outskirts of the valley, and attended the local schools Ysgol Llanllyfni and Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlle. Singer and actor Bryn Fôn from Llanllyfni and actor and author Mari Gwilym grew up in Pontllyfni. In the earlier part of the 20th century Nantlle produced the Brodyr Francis (the Francis Brothers) who toured Wales and beyond.\n\nIn the 19th century the valley had a number of brass and silver bands. Some famous for their playing ability, such as the Nantlle Royal Silver Band, are still extant. Others were more noted for their drinking ability and prowess with their fists, notably the Llanllyfni brass band and some of the Pen-y-Groes brass bands, as recorded by Geraint Jones in his book about the development of brass and silver bands in north Wales, \"Cyrn y Diafol\" (Gwasg Gwynedd 2004).\n\nThe Nantlle Ridge is regarded by many walkers as a classic route in the UK. Although usually classed as a 'moderate' walk with only minimal scrambling on the eastern side, it can be a challenge because of its route being a traverse only mainly and therefore usually needing transport at the end of the walk back to the start point and also because of the changeable weather--as the westernmost limb of Snowdonia, the area can be the first to experience bad weather coming in from the Atlantic. The views though are considered some of the best in North Wales, with the Snowdon massif to the east, Anglesey to the north, the expanse of Caernarfon Bay and the Llŷn Peininsula to the west and Cardigan bay and the Welsh coast all the way down to Pembrokeshire visible to the south. It is regularly voted one of the best and quietest routes in Snowdonia (19th on the 50 Greatest Hill Routes in Trail magazine, 2009; 21st in the Greatest Ridge walks in the UK in The Great Outdoors magazine, 2013).\n\nThe Nantlle Ridge has two Marilyns and four Hewitts on the route, the ridge is about 8–9 miles long and the high point is Craig Cwm Silyn at 2,408 feet:\n\nY Garn: 2,077 ft - 633 m (Nuttall)\nMynydd Drws y Coed: 2,280 ft - 695 m (Hewitt)\nTrum y Ddysgl: 2,326 ft - 709m (Marilyn)\nCraig Cwm Silyn: 2,408 ft - 734 m (Marilyn)\nGarnedd Goch: 2,300 ft - 701 m (Nuttall)\nMynydd Graig Goch: 2,000 ft - 610 m (Hewitt)\n\nOn the north side of the valley is the well known Mynydd Mawr (also known as Elephant mountain from viewing it from the Caernarfon side as it resembles an Indian elephant) - which trickles down to the Cilgwyn and then gently down to the valley floor - a walking route follows the path down to the valley floor.\n\nThe pass through the mountains at the eastern end of the valley is known as Drws-y-Coed (the door of the trees) and was a path that reputedly was hewn by Edward I's men after the conquest. In this part of the valley are numerous old copper mining shafts and old industrial linked buildings. There is also a memorial to a chapel that was demolished when a large boulder rolled down the mountainside and crashed into it.\n\nAt the top of the valley is Llyn y Dywarchen where Giraldus Cambrensis in 1188 told of the lake ‘having a floating island in it which is driven from one side to the other by the force of the wind’. His explanation at that time was perfectly rational. ‘A part of the bank naturally bound together by the roots of willows and other shrubs may have broken off and being continually agitated by the winds...it cannot reunite itself firmly with the banks.’\nThe astronomer and scientist Edmund Halley swam out to the island in 1698 to verify that it did indeed float.\nThomas Pennant in 1784 claimed to have seen the island and confirmed that cattle which strayed upon it when it was near the shore were occasionally marooned when it began to move.\n\nThe lake is used for fishing now and the car park there is on the site of a former clandestine Moravian lodging and chapel- one of only about 40 to have been built in the UK and therefore extremely rare, before being demolished - established in the 18th century (1704-1760s) and one of the forerunners of Methodism.\n\nA report by Gwynedd County Council in 2006 profiled the tourist industry in the Natlle Valley and made recommendations for the future.\n\nThe report list the following tourist basd business in the valley: \n\"25 tourist businesses were identified in the Nantlle Valley, 23 of these took part in the survey. Of these 25 there were 7 caravan / camping sites, 4 hotels, 3 guesthouses or B&B, 3 attractions, 3 educational centres, 2 public houses (who have tourist accommodation), 2 specialist retailers and 1 holiday cottage provider. The 23 establishments questioned have 67 full time employees and 105-part time1. Hotels are the main full time employers (19 posts), but it is the caravan sites that are the main full and part time employers (35 posts).\"\n\nAlthough the valley has plenty of natural resources - hiking, fishing, industrial heritage, the Glynllifon grounds and a long sandy and safe bathing beach at Dinas Dinlle - the infrastructure to support and develop tourism is not as well developed as other areas. The report makes recommendations for future development in the area.\n\nSome of the already developed attractions are the Glynllifon Estate grounds and the aircraft museum and airport at Dinas Dinlle. An 'unofficial' but hugely popular attraction is the old disused Dorothea Quarry - the old quarry has flooded now and attracts large numbers of divers to it. When the quarry flooded the 'galleries' and all the tackle and machinery that were on them were still present which makes diving there particularly dangerous. The unregulated nature and depth of the site has encouraged some divers to overestimate their capabilities – in the decade 1994-2004 21 divers lost their lives in the quarry. It has also been the site of unofficial 'raves' in the past.\n\nThe Nantlle Valley is predominantly a football playing region and a number of football clubs have been founded in the area over the years. \n\nThe most prominent being Nantlle Vale FC which was established in the early part of the 20th century and is still playing, based at Pen-y-groes.\n\nTalysarn Celts FC is based at Tal-y-sarn, a team in Llanllyfni and Mountain Rangers in Rhosgadfan.\n\n\"Source:\"\n\nSignificant quarries include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The film stars Sally Field, Kiefer Sutherland, Ed Harris, Beverly D'Angelo and Joe Mantegna. The story was adapted from Erika Holzer's novel of the same name. The film opened on January 12, 1996.\n\nKaren McCann is happily married to Mack and has two daughters, 17-year-old Julie (from Karen's previous marriage) and six-year-old Megan (with Mack). She lives in a lovely two-story home in Pacific Palisades, California and has a good job in a museum.\n\nKaren's perfect world is suddenly shattered when Julie is violently raped and murdered while Karen listens helplessly on the phone from her car. Detective Sergeant Joe Denillo assures Karen there is enough DNA evidence to find and convict the killer. He encourages the McCanns to seek counseling.\n\nAt a support group, they meet people in similar circumstances, including Albert and Regina Gratz, and Sidney Hughes. During the meeting, Karen overhears Albert talking to Sidney about something which alarms Regina.\n\nThe DNA tests reveal the killer, Robert Doob, a delivery man with a criminal record. At the trial it is clear Doob is guilty, but because the defense did not receive a sample of the DNA evidence, the judge dismisses the case. Karen and Mack are dumbstruck as Doob walks free. When Doob launches an antagonizing apology at Karen it causes Mack to snap and furiously attack Doob, but is overpowered by guards and Doob walks out unharmed.\n\nMack is desperate to return to a normal life, but Karen cannot stop thinking of Doob. She finds the apartment where he lives, then keeps detailed records of his movements, stalking him. After observing Doob urinate on a customer's lawn after a delivery she goes to Denillo — but he tells her there's no evidence of intent. Karen attempts to warn the delivery customer, but the woman only speaks Spanish and does not understand her.\n\nKaren later learns that the murderer of the son of a member of her support group has been killed in a drive-by shooting, just days after being released from prison. Angel, also in the self-help group, tells Karen the best way to get over her grief is to focus on having good experiences with her living daughter — and Karen realizes she has been so fixated on Doob that Megan has been deprived of her attention. Meanwhile, Doob has gone to Megan's school and struck up a conversation with the girl during recess. When Karen comes to pick up Megan, Doob deliberately intimidates her.\n\nWorried for Megan's safety, Karen's sanity is on the rocks and remembers what happened to the killer of her friend's son and approaches Sidney, who admits the drive-by shooting was set up by him and Martin. Karen demands their help and they agree to find a weapon, train her, and plan the murder, but tell her she has to carry it out. Karen agrees and they begin plotting. She also joins a self-defense class which helps her gain more confidence, helps rekindle her sex life with Mack, and improves her relationship with Megan. Karen feels encouraged. Although Martin doubts Karen is capable of murder, Sidney gives her a gun.\n\nThe next day, Angel reveals that she is really an undercover FBI Agent investigating vigilante activity. Angel warns Karen not to kill Doob. Karen calls Sidney to tell him she cannot go through with it. However, she soon changes her mind when she learns that the Hispanic customer she tried to warn about Doob has been raped and murdered just as Julie had been. Karen is so furious she accuses Denillo of not finding enough evidence, letting Doob go free. Hearing Doob has again gotten off on a technicality bolsters her resolve. Karen decides that the only way to avenge her daughter's murder and save her family from Doob is to kill him.\n\nShe sets a trap to lure Doob into her home, so that she can say killing him was self-defense. It works. She shoots Doob dead and calls the police. Denillo arrives and tells Karen that he knows the truth and that she hasn't fooled him, to which she replies, \"Prove it.\" He decides to tell his colleague that it was a \"clear case of self-defense\". When her husband arrives, he sits beside her, holding her hand, knowing what she has done.\n\n\"Eye for an Eye\" received negative reviews from critics, as it holds an 8% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 37 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Overwrought, thinly written, and all-around unpleasant, \"Eye for an Eye\" crudely exploits every parent's nightmare with deeply offensive results.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.\nRoger Ebert gave the film one star (out of four), calling it \"a particularly nasty little example of audience manipulation\" and writing that it \"is intellectually corrupt because it deliberately avoids dealing with the issues it raises.\" Ebert also compared the film to \"Dead Man Walking\", saying \"\"Dead Man Walking\" challenges us to deal with a wide range of ethical and moral issues. \"Eye for an Eye\" cynically blinkers us, excluding morality as much as it can, to service an exploitation plot.\" Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote \"Never in his varied career has Mr. Schlesinger made a film as mean-spirited and empty as this.\" She also felt \"The sole purpose of \"Eye for an Eye\" is to excite blood lust from the audience\".\n\n\n"}

He is notable for his service as Envoy to Court of St. James's from 1885 to 1889. In addition, Phelps was a founder of the American Bar Association, and served as its president from 1880 to 1881.\n\nA prominent Democrat even as Vermont was trending towards the Republicans, Phelps was the son of Senator Samuel S. Phelps and his first wife, Frances (Shurtleff) Phelps. Edward Phelps graduated from Middlebury College in 1840, taught school in Virginia, and studied for a career as an attorney, first at Yale Law School, and then in the office of Middlebury attorney Horatio Seymour. He practiced in Burlington, and served as Second Comptroller of the Treasury from 1851 to 1853. He supported the Union, but as a critic of what he regarded as the excesses of the Abraham Lincoln administration. He served as a delegate to the Vermont constitutional convention of 1870, and was one of the founders of the American Bar Association. Phelps served as ABA president from 1880 to 1881. In 1880, he was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Governor of Vermont.\n\nPhelps was Envoy to Court of St. James's in Britain from 1885 to 1889. He later taught law at Yale Law School, the University of Vermont, and Boston University. He supported Republicans after 1896, in response to his disagreement with the Democratic Party's turn towards the Free Silver movement. He died in New Haven, Connecticut, and was buried at Greenmount Cemetery in Burlington.\n\nPhelps' father Samuel S. Phelps had been a U.S. Senator from Vermont. Edward Phelps was born in Middlebury, graduated from Middlebury College in 1840, and worked as a school teacher and principal in Virginia. He studied law at the Yale Law School, completed his studies in the office of Horatio Seymour, and began practicing in Middlebury in 1843. Phelps moved to Burlington in 1845.\n\nPhelps practiced in Burlington with different partners at various times, the most prominent being David Allen Smalley. Phelps and Smalley included George F. Edmunds among the prospective attorneys who studied law with them.\n\nFrom 1851 to 1853, Phelps served as Second Comptroller of the Treasury. He then practiced law in New York City as a partner in Wakeman, Latting & Phelps, the senior partner of which was Abram Wakeman. He returned to Burlington in 1857 and resumed practicing law. Originally a Whig, after that party's demise he became a Democrat. He served as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1870.\n\nPhelps was one of the founders of the American Bar Association and was its president in 1880-1881. From 1881 until his death he was Kent Professor of Law at Yale Law School.\n\nIn 1880 Phelps was the Democratic nominee for Governor of Vermont. Democrats were a perpetual minority in Vermont, and lost every statewide election from the 1850s to the 1960s. 1880 was no exception, and Phelps was excoriated as an unrepentant Copperhead:\nHad he maintained his resolution to accept no political nomination, the memory of his attitude during the memory of his attitude from 1860 to 1865 might have quite died; but the Democratic nomination and his speech of acceptance, in which, with surprising want of tact, he aired afresh his old hatred of the African and attacked the Southern Republicans, white and black, with a virulence which few Southern Democrats could equal … have brought it into strong prominence. Still stronger light has been thrown on it by the publication of a careful stenographic report of a speech made by Mr. Phelps in September, 1864, before a little club of Copperheads in Burlington. In this he called Mr. Lincoln a 'wooden-head' and a 'twentieth-rate back country attorney,' declared that the North was fighting simply to 'turn loose all the [racial epithet]' and 'whitewash the [racial epithet] in the blood of millions[.]'.\nPhelps was Envoy to Court of St. James's in Britain from 1885 to 1889, and in 1893 served as senior counsel for the United States before the international tribunal at Paris to settle the Bering Sea Controversy. His closing argument, requiring eleven days for its delivery, was an exhaustive review of the case. The ruling favored the British, and the Americans were denied the exclusive jurisdiction they had claimed.\n\nPhelps lectured on medical jurisprudence at the University of Vermont in 1881-1883, and on constitutional law at Boston University in 1882-1883, and delivered numerous addresses, among them \"The United States Supreme Court and the Sovereignty of the People\" at the centennial celebration of the Federal Judiciary in 1890, and an oration at the dedication of the Bennington Battle Monument, unveiled in 1891 at the centennial of Vermont's admission to the Union.\n\nIn politics, Phelps was always conservative, opposing the anti-slavery movement before 1860, the free-silver movement in 1896, when he supported the Republican presidential ticket, and after 1898 becoming an ardent \"anti-expansionist.\"\n\nPresident Grover Cleveland intended to appoint him as U.S. Chief Justice in 1888, but Phelps was concerned that his tenure as ambassador to the Court of St. James's in Great Britain would cause the Democratic Party to lose the support of Irish Americans, and he declined.\n\nIn 1893, Phelps was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.\n\nPhelps died in New Haven, Connecticut. Former Yale University president Timothy Dwight V eulogized Phelps. He was buried in Burlington's Greenmount Cemetery.\n\nEdward John Phelps married Mary S. Haight in 1847; the marriage produced 3 children: Edward Haight Phelps (1847–1884), Mary Haight Phelps (1857–1911) who married Horatio Loomis, and Charles Pierpont Phelps (1861–1912).\n\n\"The man who makes no mistakes does not usually make anything.\" From a speech given at the Mansion House in London on January 24, 1899, quoting Bishop W. C. Magee of Peterborough in 1868.\n\n\"Better a hundred times an honest and capable administration of an erroneous policy than a corrupt and incapable administration of a good one.\" Spoken at a dinner of the New York Chamber of Commerce.\n\n, contains the text of Phelps' 1889 farewell speech in London.\n"}

It is the only operating tram network in India and the oldest operating electric tram in Asia, running since 1902. There are 257 trams in total, of which 125 used to run daily on the Kolkata streets, but now only 35 trams run daily. The single-deck articulated cars can carry 200 passengers (60 seated).\n\nThe first horse-drawn trams in India ran a distance between Sealdah and Armenian Ghat Street on 24 February 1873. The service was discontinued on 20 November of that year. The Calcutta Tramway Company was formed and registered in London on 22 December 1880. Metre-gauge horse-drawn tram tracks were laid from Sealdah to Armenian Ghat via Bowbazar Street, Dalhousie Square and Strand Road. The route was inaugurated by Viceroy Ripon on 1 November 1880. In 1882, steam locomotives were deployed experimentally to haul tram cars. By the end of the 19th century the company owned 166 tram cars, 1000 horses, seven steam locomotives and 19 miles of tram tracks. In 1900, electrification of the tramway and reconstruction of its tracks to (standard gauge) began. In 1902, the first electric tramcar in India ran from Esplanade to Kidderpore on 27 March and on 14 June from Esplanade to Kalighat.\n\nThe Calcutta Tramways Company is in the process of upgrading the existing tram network in Kolkata at a cost of .\n\nA mass public-transport system for Mumbai (then Bombay) was proposed in 1865 by an American company, which applied for a licence to operate a horse-drawn tram system. Although a licence was granted, the project was never realised due to the city's economic depression.\n\nThe Bombay Tramway Company was set up in 1873. After a contract was signed between the Bombay Tramway Company, the municipality and the Stearns and Kitteredge company, the Bombay Presidency enacted the Bombay Tramways Act, 1874 licensing the company to run a horsecar tram service in the city. On 9 May 1874 the first horse-drawn carriage made its début in the city, plying the Colaba–Pydhone via Crawford Market, and Bori Bunder to Pydhonie via Kalbadevi routes. The initial fare was three annas (15 paise pre-decimalisation), and no tickets were issued. As the service became increasingly popular, the fare was reduced to two annas (10 pre-decimalisation paise). Later that year, tickets were issued to curb increasing ticket-less travel. Stearns and Kitteredge reportedly had a stable of 900 horses when the tram service began.\n\nIn 1899, the Bombay Tramway Company applied to the municipality to operate electric trams. In 1904, the British Electric Traction Company applied for a license to supply electricity to the city with the Brush Electrical Engineering Company its agent. It received the Bombay electric license on 31 July 1905, signed by Bombay Tramways Company, the Bombay Municipality and the Brush Electrical Company. In 1905, the Bombay Electric Supply and Tramway Company (BEST) was formed. BEST received a monopoly on electric supply and an electric tram service in the city, and bought the Bombay Tramway Company's assets for . Two years later, the first electric tram debuted in the city. Later that year, a steam power generator was commissioned at Wari Bunder. In 1916 a power purchase from Tata Power (a private company) began, and by 1925 all power generation was outsourced from Tata. To ease rush-hour traffic, double-decker trams were introduced in September 1920. The trams met travellers' needs until the betterment of the city's train network, and the service closed on 31 March 1964.\n\nTrams in Nashik (then Nasik) were built in 1889 as narrow gauge. The consulting engineer was Everard Calthrop, later known with the Barsi Light Railway. Originally, the tram used two carriages pulled by four horses. It ran from the present Old Municipal Corporation building on Main Road to the Nasik Road railway station, a distance of . The stretch between Nashik and Nashik Road was jungle-covered, and the only mode of transport from the station to the city was horse-drawn carriage or one of two taxis. The tram ceased operations between 1931 and 1933.\n\nTrams in Chennai (then Madras) operated between the docks and the inland areas, carrying goods and passengers. When the system began on 7 May 1895, it was India's first electric tram system. The original conduit system was replaced by a conventional overhead wire system after a series of destructive monsoons. The trams could carry heavy loads and were popular, with thousands of riders daily. The route included Mount Road, Parry's Corner, Poonamallee Road and the Ripon Building. At its height in 1921, 97 cars ran on of track. The tram company went bankrupt about 1950, and the system closed on 12 April 1953.\n\nIn June 1907, trams were introduced in Kanpur (then Cawnpore). There were of track and 20 single-deck open trams. The single-track line connected the railway station with Sirsaya Ghat on the banks of the Ganges. Photographs of Cawnpore trams are rare. The introductory stock was electric-traction single-coach; single-coach trams were also used in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. The service was discontinued on 16 May 1933.\n\nThe Cochin State Forest Tramway was a forest tramway running from the Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary in Palakkad district to Chalakudy in Thrissur district. Operating from 1907 to 1963, it served the then Cochin state (now part of Kerala) and brought teak and rosewood from forests for global shipment.\n\nTrams in Delhi began operation on 6 March 1908. At its zenith in 1921, there were 24 open cars on of track. Jama Masjid, Chandni Chowk, Chawri Bazaar, Katra Badiyan, Lal Kuan and Fatehpuri were linked with Sabzi Mandi, Sadar Bazar, Paharganj, Ajmeri Gate, Bara Hindu Rao and Tis Hazari. The system closed in 1963 due to urban congestion.\n\nPatna had horse-drawn trams as urban transport The tram in Patna ran in the populated area of Ashok Rajpath, from Patna City to Bankipore, with its western terminus at Sabzibagh (opposite the Pirbahore police station). It was discontinued in 1903 due to low ridership, and plans to extend the route westward never materialised.\n\nBhavnagar had a narrow-gauge tram built by Bhavnagar State. The first section was built in 1926 from Bhavnagar south to Talaja, and was extended to Mahuva in 1938. The total length of the tramway was . The tramway used small 4-8-0 locomotives later classified as T-class. In 1947 the tramway was taken over by the Saurashtra Railway, and later by the Western Railway. It was closed during the 1960s.\n\n\n"}

It is located at latitude 40°28' 16 N: longitude 71°43' 29 E. at an altitude of 487 meters.\n\nAccording to European legend, Margilan was founded by Alexander the Great. On a lunch stop, he was given chicken (\"murgh\"; in Persian مرغ) and bread (\"nan\"; in Persian نان), from which the town took its name. More reliable records indicate that Margilan was an important stop on the Silk Road by the 9th century AD, along the route going across the Alay Mountains to Kashgar.\n\nWriting in the early 16th century, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, Babur, mentioned that “the pomegranates and apricots are superb ... the game in Margilan is good; white deer may be found nearby. The people are Sarts. They are a feisty people, ready with their fists. The custom of exorcism is widespread throughout Transoxiana, and most of the renowned exorcists of Samarkand and Bukhara are Margilanis. The author of the \"Hidaya\" (Burhan al-Din al-Marghinani) was from a Margilan village called Rishtan”. This reputation for toughness extends to modern times. Margilan merchants were key players in Central Asian commerce, and were said to be a law unto themselves during Soviet days, when Margilan was the heart of Uzbekistan’s black market. Margilan today is also a stronghold of conservative Islam.\n\nThe town is the location of Uzbekistan’s largest traditional silk factory, the Yodgorlik Silk Factory. Employing over 2,000 workers, everything is done in the traditional manner, for an annual output of some 250,000 square meters of highly premium silk cloth\n\nThe neighboring Margilan Silk Factory employs 15,000 workers using modern machinery, and produces some 22 million square meters per year. It is uncertain when the secrets of silk production came to the Fergana Valley, but certainly, Margilan has been active in the industry since ancient times.\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in Metz, France to copperplate engraver Sebastian le Clerc and his wife Charlotte van den Kerckhove. He was summoned to Denmark at the age of 47, and lived out the rest of his life there as a royal sculptor to the Danish Court and as professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Art. He helped introduce French Rococo artistic ideals to Denmark.\n\nHe studied at the French Academy of Art, the \"Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture\" under sculptor Charles-Antoine Coysevox. There he won two prizes for his work.\n\nHe traveled to Ansbach in Bavaria and Brühl near Cologne in 1734-1735.\n\nIn Ansbach he worked for the Margrave Carl Wilhelm Friderich.\n\nIn Brühl he worked for Cologne’s Archbishop and German Empire Prince Elector Clemens August von Wittelsbach. Here he assisted Bavarian Court master builder, architect François de Cuvilliés 1734-1735 on the Elector’s hunting lodge Falkenlust (also known as \"Schloss Falkenlust\"), on the grounds of Augustusburg (also known as \"Schloss Augustusburg\"). These buildings are now considered the most important buildings of the late Baroque and Rococo in all of the Rhineland. They were declared a World Heritage Site in 1984 by UNESCO.\n\nFigure groups in wall niches in the upper vestibule sculpted by le Clerc are still extant.\n\nHe was summoned to Denmark in the summer of 1735 by King Christian VI to help with the interior decoration of Christiansborg Palace. He arrived that same year along with his wife, Caroline Wilhelmine Isabella, and was named royal sculptor to the Danish Court in December of that same year.\n\nHe was, along with Elias David Häusser and Nicolai Eigtved, one of the primary figures involved in the creation of Christiansborg. He was named head of the sculpture and stone work at the palace in 1737. Most of the work he did at Christiansborg, however, was eventually lost, having been destroyed in the fire of 1794.\n\nExisting still to this day are wood carved vases in Christiansborg’s horse stalls, and relief medallions on the side of the Marble Bridge (\"Marmorbro\") that leads to the castle’s main entrance. Four perspective drawings he made of Christiansborg 1746-1747 are in the collection of the Engraving Museum in Copenhagen.\n\nDestroyed work from the castle includes the cornices, capitals and frames of the windows; carved wall panels, fireplaces and console tables in both the king’s and the queen’s suites; the golden dining room with buffet and chandelier; sculptures on the balustrade, and all sculpture work in the castle church.\n\nIn 1739 he created a fountain in the King’s Garden (\"Kongens Have\") at Rosenborg Castle representing a boy with a swan. The sandstone original was replaced by a bronze figure featuring a similar motif; the replacement was designed and produced by Hermann Ernst Freund in 1837.\n\nAfter Hendrick Krock’s death in 1738 le Clerc, along with the Venetian history painter Hieronimo Miani, took over the leadership of the burgeoning Royal Danish Academy of Art, then known as the Drawing and Painting Academy (\"Tegne- og Malerakademiet\"). He served as leader of the Academy 1740-1748.\n\nHis first wife died on January 22, 1741. He married his second wife Jacobine Louise Lefèvre a year later, on January 30, 1742.\n\nHe continued alone in the role of Academy director after Miani left Denmark in 1745, and until architect Nicolai Eigtved took full control over the Academy. In 1746 Frederik V, the successor king to Christian VI, came to the throne. As the king was an absolute king, and the Academy’s protector, changes in government could, and often did, mean major changes to organizations dependent on royalty’s good graces. While le Clerc had been greatly favoured by King Christian VI, who appreciated his artistic abilities, Frederik V favoured other artists.\n\nFrederik V affirmed his support for the Academy by issuing a royal resolution on February 12, 1748. In addition to a financial commitment there were specified organizational changes. At the same time le Clerc was named professor to the Academy, one of the first artists to be so named.\n\nFrederik V established the current Academy of Art (now called \"Det kongelige skildre-, billedhugger- og bygningsakademi\", in English \"The Royal Painting, Sculpture and Architecture Academy\") in 1754. He was made a member of the Academy that same year, and also named professor. Le Clerc did not play a significant role in the new Academy, other than as a teacher. After Frederik V had summoned another French-born sculptor Jacques Saly to Denmark in 1752 to create a monumental equestrian statue of himself for the courtyard of Amalienborg Palace, le Clerc’s importance went down and his production became small.\n\nHe continued as professor at the Academy until his death. His artistic skills were not employed much in his later years. He died in Copenhagen, in his house on Brolæggerstræde, on March 8, 1771. He was buried in the Reformed Cemetery in Copenhagen.\n\nMost of his work has been lost to the ravages of time, especially due to the disastrous fire at Christiansborg. In addition to the few extant pieces previously noted, there is still work of le Clerc’s in the Knight’s Hall (\"Riddersalen\") in Moltkes Palace, one of the four buildings at the Amalienborg Palace complex.\n\nBut even before the great fire destroyed so much of his work, the tides had shifted against him. Rococo, as an artistic ideal, had been discredited, and Frederik V, the successor king to le Clerc’s great patron, chose to favour other artists.\n\nIn addition, some drawing of his work are still in existence.\n\nHis portrait of Carl Gustaf Pilo is in the keepsake of the Academy.\n\n"}

The nonfiction book recounts a double murder on Palmyra Atoll; the subsequent arrest, trial and conviction of Duane (\"Buck\") Walker; and the acquittal of his girlfriend, Stephanie Stearns, whom Bugliosi and Leonard Weinglass defended. The book went to No. 1 on \"The New York Times\" hardcover bestseller list in March 1991 and is still in print as a trade paperback and ebook.\n\nIn 1974, a yachting couple from San Diego, California, Malcolm \"Mac\" Graham III, 43, and Eleanor LaVerne \"Muff\" Graham, 40, sailed a 38-foot ketch to Palmyra Atoll — 1,200 miles south of Honolulu — hoping to find it deserted and to pass an idyllic year or more there. The wealthy Grahams overcame their disappointment at finding other sailors already on Palmyra, including two male Canadian scientists. The couple found the two men amiable and intelligent, and stayed.\n\nAlso on Palmyra were Wesley G. Walker (a.k.a. Buck Walker) and Stephanie Stearns (referred to as \"Jennifer Jenkins\" in the book), who had sailed there together from Hawaii on Stearns' sailing vessel \"Iola\", a deteriorating, patched-together wooden sloop that lacked a reliable auxiliary engine. In contrast, the Grahams' ketch, the \"Sea Wind\", was beautifully finished and impeccably outfitted, with an onboard machine shop equipped with a lathe and acetylene welding torch.\n\nWalker was an ex-convict fleeing a drug possession charge and had come up with the idea of growing cannabis on Palmyra to support himself. The Grahams were a happily married couple touring the world, and Mr. Graham ran his business remotely. The Grahams had brought more than a year's supply of food for their voyage, but Walker and Stearns quickly consumed their own meager supplies and resorted to harvesting the island's few coconuts, often by chopping down entire trees, leaving scars on the island habitat. As Walker's method of farming became unsustainable, he and Stearns were forced to plan a voyage in the rickety \"Iola\", against prevailing winds and currents, to Fanning (Tabuaeran), a nearby atoll in Kiribati, to restock — a voyage that was somewhere between difficult and impossible without a working auxiliary engine.\n\nAccording to Stearns, the Grahams disappeared sometime between August 28 and August 30, 1974, and the young couple found the Grahams' Zodiac rigid inflatable dinghy upside down. On September 11, 1974, after days of searching and waiting for the Grahams to return to their boat, Stearns said she and Walker scuttled the \"Iola\" and sailed for Hawaii on the \"Sea Wind\". Once in Hawaii, the couple had the \"Sea Wind\" repainted and also renamed it, which according to boating superstition brings bad luck. This act aroused suspicion; acquaintances of the Grahams easily recognized the distinctive \"Sea Wind\" despite its new paint job. Stearns was arrested in the lower level of the Hawaii Yacht Club for the theft of the \"Sea Wind\", but Walker was able to escape and avoid capture by using a motorized dinghy to race up the \"400 row\" of the Ala Wai Harbor. It was believed he fled on foot after leaving the dinghy at the loading dock near the Ilikai Hotel.\n\nEarly one morning in 1981, other visitors to Palmyra, sailors Robert and Sharon Jordan, from Durban, South Africa, found Muff Graham's skull and other skeletal remains in the surf near a large metal container. The remains showed signs of dismemberment and burning (possibly by Mac Graham's acetylene welding torch), and the body appeared to have been concealed underwater in the container.\n\nBuck Walker was tried and convicted of Muff Graham's murder. He was incarcerated at United States Penitentiary, Victorville, in California. Although Walker never testified, the defense claimed that he and Stearns were attempting to return the \"Sea Wind\" to Hawaii with the \"Iola\" in tow, but the \"Iola\" ran aground on the reef as they exited the lagoon and had to be abandoned. During the voyage back to Hawaii, it was claimed that a large swordfish damaged the \"Sea Wind\"s hull below the waterline, necessitating her repair and subsequent repainting and renaming.\n\nStephanie Stearns was tried separately in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco. After Bugliosi argued that Buck Walker had committed the Palmyra murders himself without Stearns' participation or knowledge, and following her testimony at the trial, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.\n\nThe book was adapted into the 1991 television film \"And the Sea Will Tell\", directed by Tommy Lee Wallace which aired on CBS As a 4-hour film (Part 1 aired on February 24, and Part 2 was aired 2 days later on the 26th that month.)\n\nThe trial lawyer who represented Walker, Earle Partington, sued Bugliosi for defamation, claiming that both the book and the docudrama portrayed Partington in a negative light. The court found for Bugliosi, ruling that this was his protected opinion.\n\nWalker was released on parole in September 2007 at the age of 69, after serving 22 years of a life sentence, and died of a stroke on April 26, 2010 at the age of 72. Prior to his death, Walker had been living in a trailer home in Willits, California. Walker (writing as Wesley G. Walker), claimed in a book about that case that he had been seduced by Mrs. Graham and, in the midst of lovemaking, had been caught by Mr. Graham, who shot his wife and attempted to shoot Walker.\n\nMalcolm Graham's body has never been found.\n\n"}

She is a bounty hunter with a mutation that gives her a vampiric lust for blood.\n\nWhen the character was first devised, there was some debate over Durham Red or Chelsea Blue as the character's name. The writers, John Wagner and Alan Grant, settled on Durham Red, and the character immediately proved popular from her first appearance. Following the death of Johnny Alpha, she was given a leading role in the spin-off series \"Strontium Dogs\" and in her own series, \"Durham Red\". Following the departure of writer Peter Hogan, the series was handed to Dan Abnett. Abnett's first action was to place Red in suspended animation and have her awake a thousand years after \"Strontium Dog\" continuity, in a universe where she was worshipped as a mythical saint of mutants.\n\nWith art by several artists including Mark Harrison, the series has enjoyed a long run. Dan Abnett's final story was printed in 2004, envisioning Durham Red surviving another ten thousand years, watching over the end of the human race and the beginning of a mutant-populated universe. Since then, the character has returned in stories set before Abnett's, in which she is still in the 22nd century.\n\nAs a result of radioactive fallout (strontium-90) from a nuclear war in 2150, Durham Red was born with a mutation which made her resemble a vampire in appearance and behaviour, although she had no supernatural attributes. Shunned by other mutants, she joined the Search / Destroy agency at a young age and became a bounty hunter, or \"strontium dog.\" While working for the agency she met Johnny Alpha (the lead character in the \"Strontium Dog\" series) and they were briefly romantically involved, but he was unable to trust her (and with good reason).\n\nAt some unspecified time after Alpha's death, Red became tired of her life and entered suspended animation. She only intended to do this for a couple of years, but she was not awoken until 1,272 years later. On her revival she discovered that the human race had spread throughout the galaxy but was still divided between pure-blood humans and mutants. As a mutant who drank the blood of normal humans, she had become a mythical figure to the mutants, who revered her as a saint (\"Saint Scarlet\"). Her efforts to end the conflict backfired and only made things much worse, costing the lives of billions. However she lived for another ten thousand years, and eventually witnessed a renaissance of human civilisation. In the last episode of Dan Abnett's stories, it is implied that she became an empress and was responsible for a new golden age of humanity, before faking her death and withdrawing from public life. Stories published since then (2004) are set before she entered suspended animation.\n\nShe has appeared in a number of strips and featured in her own \"Durham Red\" title:\n\n\nSome of the later stories have been collected into a number of trade paperbacks:\n\n\nPeter J. Evans has written a number of Durham Red novels that have been published by Black Flame:\n\n\nCritics said that Rayne, from the videogame series \"BloodRayne\" shows a strong similarity to Durham Red, having the same weapons and distinctive red hair. The claim has been denied by the TRI representatives. In a posting on the BloodRayne.co.uk forums Joe Wampole, a developer for \"BloodRayne\" declared:\n\n\n<br>\n"}

He is considered to be the father of operations research in the U.S.\n\nMorse graduated from the Case School of Applied Science in 1926 with a B.S. in physics. He earned his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University in 1929. In 1930, he was granted an International Fellowship, which he used to do postgraduate study and research at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich under Arnold Sommerfeld during the winter of 1930 to the spring of 1931.\n\nFrom the spring through the summer of 1931, he was at Cambridge University. Upon return to the United States, he joined the faculty of MIT.\n\nIn 1949 he was named the first Research Director of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG), an organization founded to conduct studies for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he served a year and a half before returning to MIT in the summer of 1950. In 1956 he launched MIT’s Operations Research Center, directing it until 1968, and awarding the first Ph.D. in OR in the U.S. to John Little.\n\nHe was a member of a National Research Council committee dedicated to bringing OR into civilian life, and was a prime mover behind the creation of the Operations Research Society of America (ORSA) in 1952. He served as president of the American Physical Society, president of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA), and board chair of the American Institute of Physics.\n\nIn 1946, he was a recipient of the Medal for Merit from the U.S. President for his work during the war. In 1973 the ASA awarded him the Gold Medal, its highest award, for his work on vibration.\n\nPhilip Morse made many contributions to the development of operations research (OR). Early in 1942 he organized the Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG), later ORG, for the U.S. Navy, after the US had entered World War II and was faced with the problem of Nazi German U-boat attacks on transatlantic shipping. \"That Morse’s group was an important factor in winning the war is fairly obvious to everyone who knows anything about the inside of the war,\" wrote historian John Burchard.\n\nPhilip Morse co-authored \"Methods of Operations Research\", the first OR textbook in the U.S., with George E. Kimball based on the Navy work. His further writings include the influential books \"Queues, Inventories, and Maintenance\" and \"Library Effectiveness\". He received ORSA's Lanchester Prize in 1968 for the latter book.\n\nPhilip Morse gave the opening address at the 1957 organizing meeting of the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS). In 1959 he chaired the first NATO advisory panel on OR.\n\nPhilip Morse had a distinguished career in physics. Amongst his contributions to physics are the textbooks \"Quantum Mechanics\" (with Edward Condon), \"Methods of Theoretical Physics\" (with Herman Feshbach), \"Vibration and Sound\", \"Theoretical Acoustics\", and \"Thermal Physics\". Morse is also one of the founding editors of \"Annals of Physics\". In 1929 he proposed the Morse potential function for diatomic molecules which was often used to interpret vibrational spectra, though the standard is now the more modern Morse/Long-range potential.\n\nHis administrative talents were applied in roles as co-founder of the MIT Acoustics Laboratory, first director of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, founder and first director of the MIT Computation Center, and board member of the RAND Corporation and the Institute for Defense Analyses.\n\nHe chaired the advisory committee that supervised preparation of \"Handbook of Mathematical Functions, with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables\".\n\n\n"}

Central to the making of Said Mahran is also Ra'uf 'Ilwan, his one-time criminal mentor, who used the same revolutionist rhetoric, but now, being a respected journalist and businessman, is in seeming opposition to Said, whose outlook hasn't changed. These perceived betrayals throw the protagonist into the utmost confusion and his initial calculation in revenge becomes ever more a wild flailing against the whole world. Only Nur, a prostitute, and Tarzan, a café-owner, provide Said with any aid and support from the world at large which is closing in on him, yet in time even they cannot help him.\n\n\nHeavily dependent on imagery, the thief, Said, is depicted as a tragic hero being Rady chased down by those he perceives as dogs. The recurring images of prison, betrayal and darkness amongst others also permeate the text. The novel is remarkable because it is the first novel to employ the stream of consciousness style of writing in Arabic. It helped, therefore, to confirm Mahfouz's stature as a pioneer in the field of literature. \n\nThe novel was adapted into a film and a television series in Egypt. The film was first released in 1962, only one year after the novel was first published, with a screenplay by Salah Jahin. The film starred Shoukry Sarhan (Said), Kamal el-Shennawi, and Shadia (Nur). The television series was released in 1975, and lasted only one season (13 episodes). Although it was an Egyptian series, it was produced by a Dubai-based television station.\n\n"}

Old 'Borough of Shoreditch' signs can still be seen above street name signs in that south-west part of the street.\n\nBefore the late 20th century, it was the site of a busy fruit and vegetable market, but this slowly dwindled over time - in the early 2000s, market activity was limited to a couple of stands selling produce. On 8 May 2004 a food market was launched on Saturdays which has since become firmly established. Broadway Market is closed to traffic when the market is being held (9am - 5pm). Thanks largely to the market a number of new restaurants and boutiques have opened in the area.\n\nThe ongoing development of Broadway Market has sparked a local debate about the perceived gentrification of Hackney and the way Hackney council disposed of some of their commercial property portfolio. In late 2005, a group of local protestors occupied 34 Broadway Market (Francesca's café) to bring attention to the issue. Despite being evicted on 21 December 2005 the building was successfully reoccupied on 27 December (replacing the demolished roof in the process) before the protestors were again evicted on 23 February 2006. Ultimately, the battle was lost and the former proprietor of Francesca's cafe now runs the Little Francesca's juice stall on Saturdays in Broadway Market. The battle did not end, however, and local shopkeeper Spirit, whose shop was sold to an overseas developer by Hackney Council, fought several court battles to regain his property after proving that Hackney Council had cashed the cheque for his purchase deposit prior to selling his property to an overseas development company. Ultimately Spirit lost his battle too - winning in court but unable to reverse the transaction.\n\nBroadway Market, and specifically the barber shop, was the location for David Cronenberg's 2007 film, Eastern Promises. The opening scenes of the 1988 movie \"Buster\" were shot at the Regent's Canal end of the market. It was also used for filming some scenes in the 1947 film \"Odd Man Out\". Along with many squares and streets in the East End of London, it is rumoured that the old Broadway Market partly inspired the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2192877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192877", "title": "1946 Polish people's referendum", "text": "1946 Polish people's referendum\n\nThe People's Referendum () of 1946, also known as the Three Times Yes referendum (Trzy razy tak, often abbreviated as 3×TAK), was a referendum held in Poland on 30 June 1946 on the authority of the State National Council (order of 27 April 1946). The referendum presented an opportunity for the forces vying for political control of Poland following World War II to test their popularity among the general population. However, the results were forged and the referendum failed to meet democratic standards.\n\nThe referendum comprised three questions:\n\nParties of the pro-communist Democratic Bloc, (the Polish Workers' Party (PPR), Socialist Party, Democratic Party, and People's Party) campaigned heavily in favor of \"Three Times Yes\", while non-communist parties advocated various other combinations; hence the referendum was seen as unofficially deciding whether the Polish citizenry supported or opposed communism. The Polish People's Party (PSL) and Labor Party, which realized what was really at stake in the vote, namely Polish independence and the future of the country, advocated voting \"no\" on the first question, despite the fact that it had been opposed to the Senate's existence since before the war. The majority of PSL political support was in rural areas, among people who supported agricultural reform, so the party found it impossible to advocate voting \"no\" on the second question. Nonetheless, the party's opposition to the first question was used by the communists to declare the more liberal PSL activists \"traitors\". Catholic groups supported \"no\" on the first question, \"yes\" on the third, and left the second to voters individual preferences. The Wolność i Niezawisłość party argued against the first two questions only, while the National Armed Forces advocated a \"no\" for all three questions, as a sign of protest against the annexation of the eastern territories of Poland (known as the Kresy) by the Soviet Union.\n\nThe official results, published on 12 July 1946, showed that from a population of 13,160,451 eligible voters, 90.1% or 11,857,986 had taken part in the referendum. Of these, 11,530,551 or 97.2% were counted as valid. On the first question, 68% of voters chose \"yes\". On the second question, 77.2% voted \"yes\". On the third question, 91.4% voted \"yes\".\n\nHowever, the official results were far removed from the actual results since the vote had been seriously compromised by the communists and their supporters. The communists, who already \"de facto\" controlled much of the government and had the backing of the military (both the Polish Wojsko Ludowe and Soviet Red Army), used the police (Milicja Obywatelska) and the secret services (Urząd Bezpieczeństwa) to threaten, assault and even murder opposition activists, switch real ballots for false ones, stuff ballot boxes with false votes, consider blank ballots as \"yes\" votes, destroy votes not in favour of all or any of the three questions or simply falsify votes. Voting in the army was done on command and without secrecy. The falsification was overseen, just like the later 1947 Polish legislative election, by Soviet experts like Aron Palkin and Semyon Davydov, both high-ranking officers from the Soviet Ministry for State Security.\n\nIn Kraków, where the opposition managed to ensure a fair vote, the \"no\" results were: 84%, 59% and 30% for all three questions. PSL, which was able to obtain real records for approximately 48% of the voting districts, estimated that a \"yes\" for all three questions was chosen by 16.7% of respondents. Despite the protests of the opposition, led by Stanisław Mikołajczyk, and representatives of the United Kingdom and United States, the results were declared free and fair by the government.\n\nFollowing the referendum, the Allies called for democratic elections. However, the 1947 elections were \"completely manipulated\".\n\nAccording to documents released forty years later, 29% of respondents had voted yes for all three questions. The official results indicated this figure was 68%. Materials published after the communists lost power in Poland in 1989 showed that only the third question received a majority of votes in favor. For the first question, \"yes\" was chosen by 26.9% voters. For the second question, 42% chose \"yes\". For the third question, 66.9% chose \"yes\".\n\n"}

It was hosted by Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht, who had previously hosted TechTV's \"The Screen Savers\" together. Its main purpose was to discuss some of the top stories from Digg, the social news and bookmarking website developed by Rose and others. The first episode \"aired\" online on July 1, 2005. The format of the show usually involved Rose and Albrecht reviewing beverages, mostly beer, but occasionally tea, coffee, hard liquors like Vodka or Whisky at the opening of the show, which they consumed throughout the show, followed by them discussing various Digg stories from the previous week, with often off-topic banter with each other and with producer David Prager and camera operator Glenn McElhose. Both audio and video versions of the podcast are available from Revision3 for streaming or downloading in various formats.\n\nThe intro sequence was created by Eden Soto in collaboration with David Prager. It was in development for more than three months, according to Eden Soto's website.\n\nA spin-off show, \"The Digg Reel\" ran from January 2008 to September 2010, and was originally hosted by Jessica Corbin, followed by Andrew Bancroft. The show featured the week's top user submitted videos in comparison to Diggnation's primary focus on news articles. Both were produced by Revision3.\n\nOn October 3, 2011 David Prager announced the show would end with its 340th episode at the end of 2011. Occasional Reunion Live Shows might happen in the future.\n\nOn October 13, 2017, Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht announced and released a \"light Diggnation reunion\" under the title of \"Talking Tech\", released within Kevin Rose's \"Kevin Rose Show\" podcast. In the episode, Alex and Kevin confirmed new episodes of \"Talking Tech\" will be released every 4 to 5 episodes of the \"Kevin Rose Show.\"\n\nThe show begins immediately with a short listing of the podcast's current sponsors, and is usually followed by a humorous fake advertisement (i.e. Bose's Noise Enhancing Headphones, \"Days of our Prager\", Cougars: Aged to Perfection, etc.). After the title video, the hosts introduce themselves, tell the viewers where they are filming from, make any relevant announcements, and discuss the drinks they will have during the episode. The beer tasting and beverage aspect of Diggnation is one of the show's unique aspects. The majority of the episode is dedicated to the discussion of news items as well as personal commentary, anecdotes and unrelated banter. The show's humor is generally somewhat vulgar, often due to considerable intoxication. At the end of the show, Rose and Albrecht mention their sponsors once again in a longer advertisement spot, read e-mail from fans, then conclude the show with a seemingly ad libbed phrase or saying. Starting with more recent episodes, larger Digg stories (typically the weeks big news) are discussed after the ads, but before the emails. This is keeping in line with most other Revision3 shows.\n\nDiggnation episodes were released weekly on Wednesdays at 6 PM (EST). Previously, the show was released on Friday at the same time for paid members, and Sunday at 12:01 for everyone. There were an estimated 250,000 regular subscribers to the show during its peak. BitGravity handles iTunes and TiVo subscribers, downloads from the website, and RSS feeds. Virgin America airlines also offers on-demand episodes available on the in flight entertainment systems (along with other Revision3 shows). Repeats, edited for content, time and profanity, are also seen on the cable network Youtoo TV as part of Revision3's contract with that network.\n\nDiggnation occasionally hosted live shows. These shows have been hosted at CES, SXSW, Reno, Macworld, San Francisco, E3, San Diego, Hollywood, London, St. Louis, Amsterdam, San Francisco, Tokyo, Los Angeles, and New York City. The final live show was the Diggnation finale held on December 30, 2011 at The Music Box in Hollywood, CA.\n\nDavid Prager suggested to name the Digg website \"Diggnation\". Rose decided on the simpler Digg instead. Rose subsequently chose Diggnation as the name of the podcast.\n\nAlthough hosting duties were typically split solely between Kevin and Alex, a few \"third-chair\" guests were invited onto the program:\n\n\nIn addition, though not officially invited to join in on stories, other guests included \"To Catch A Predator's\" Chris Hansen, Adam Carolla, Ashton Kutcher, WWE Diva and Go Daddy Girl Candice Michelle, Gary Vaynerchuk, Rachel Maddow, Leo Laporte, director Robert Rodriguez and Tony Hawk.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2192882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192882", "title": "Prodeinotherium", "text": "Prodeinotherium\n\nProdeinotherium is an extinct representative of the family Deinotheriidae that lived in Africa, Europe, and Asia in the early and middle Miocene. \"Prodeinotherium\", meaning \"before terrible beast\", was first named in 1930, but soon after, the only species in it, \"P. hungaricum\", was reassigned to \"Deinotherium\". During the 1970s, however, the two genera were once again separated, with \"Prodeinotherium\" diagnosed to include \"Deinotherium bavaricum\" (=\"P. hungaricum\"), \"Deinotherium hobleyi\", and \"Deinotherium pentapotamiae\", which were separated based on geographic location. The three species are from Europe, Africa, and Asia, respectively. However, because of usage of few characters to separate them, only one species, \"P. bavaricum\", or many more species, including \"P. cuvieri\", \"P. orlovii\", and \"P. sinense\" may be possible.\n\n\"Prodeinotherium\" is one of three genera of the Deinotheriidae, the others being \"Chilgatherium\" from Africa, and \"Deinotherium\" from Europe, Africa, and Asia. \"Chilgatherium\" preceded \"Prodeinotherium\", while \"Deinotherium\" succeeded it. \"P. hobleyi\" was the first species of \"Prodeinotherium\", and it migrated into Asia and Europe before evolving into \"P. pentapotamiae\" and then \"P. bavaricum\". \"Prodeinotherium\" lived for the Early Miocene and Middle Miocene before being replaced by \"Deinotherium\". The deinotheriids are an early branch of proboscideans, although more derived than \"Barytherium\" and \"Moeritherium\".\n\nAll deinotheres were large animals that evolved to be even larger, and many features are shared throughout the group. \"Prodeinotherium\" and \"Deinotherium\" both had large, downcurved tusks on the lower jaw, but none on the upper jaw. This could have been used to grasp food while the tusks moved branches out of the way. \"Prodeinotherium\" was slightly smaller than \"Deinotherium\", yet much larger than more primitive proboscideans. All \"Prodeinotherium\" species were similar in size, ranging from tall and weighing about .\n\n\"Prodeinotherium\" was the size of the present Asian elephant, about at the shoulders, but differing from elephants by lacking upper tusks and instead possessing downward-facing lower tusks. In appearance and many characters, it was like \"Deinotherium\", but differed in being of smaller size, having shorter fore limbs, and also in various details in the shape and form of the teeth. A potentially adult female specimen of \"P. bavaricum\" is estimated to be tall and weigh , while an adult male measured tall and was about . The earliest species \"P. hobleyi\" was estimated at similar tall and . \"Prodeinotherium hobleyi\" was larger and more specialised than its Oligocene predecessor \"Chilgatherium\". It flourished for several millions of years, before being replaced in the middle Miocene by the much larger \"Deinotherium\".\n\n\"Prodeinotherium\" is distinguished from \"Deinotherium\" from multiple features, including possessing a different dental formula of 003/103 and 0023/1023; M2-3 with an ornamentation; the rostrum turns down parallel to the mandibular symphysis; the rostrum and external nares narrow; the swelling of the preorbital is close to the orbit; the roof of the skull is longer and wider than in \"Deinotherium\"; the articulation between the neck vertebrae and skull is more upturned; the skeleton is graviportally adapted; the scapula has a prominent spine and a stout acromion and metacromion; and the carpal bones and tarsal bones are narrow, but not dolichopodous.\n\nDeinotheres such as \"Prodeinotherium\" have a muscle attachment for a trunk-like structure. However, instead of an elephant-like trunk, the appendage was more muscular and similar to a tapirs snout. Within the evolution of \"Prodeinotherium\", the paired \"tongs\" at the end of the trunk were lost.\n\n\"P. bavaricum\", fossils of which come from the Upper Freshwater Molasse, is the most well-studied species of \"Prodeinotherium\", with multiple features shared among all specimens, not necessarily to the exclusion of other species. Some of these features include \"small size, generally simple dental structure, less enamel plication and crenulation, ... thus the valleys of the premolars are well separated, slender teeth, bicuspid mesial lophid in P3 (the cuspids are distinct but more compressed against each other than in P. hobleyi), and clear mesial projection (“preprotolophide”) in P3; sometimes is bicuspid.\" Other features noted earlier in 1957 include \"the mesial lophid of P3 is well separated into two cuspids, the mesial projection of P3 is well developed and often bicuspid, and the base of the protoconid in P3 is longer than that of the metaconid.\" \"P. hobleyi\" differs in morphology from \"P. bavaricum\" mostly in these P3 characteristics.\n\nAll deinothere mandibles have the same basic anatomy, with a downturned symphysis, and lower incisors. Most differences of deinothere genera are in the P3 tooth morphology and dimensions of the mandible and teeth. Measurements of the mandible have shown that the curve of the jaw is relative to the length of the jaw; a longer jaw means a stronger curve. A distinguishing feature of \"Prodeinotherium\" is that the area at the base of the curve in the jaw is flat, while a depression is seen in all specimens of \"Deinotherium\".\n\n\"Prodeinotherium\" lived during the Early Miocene and Middle Miocene, about 19.0 to 18.0 million years ago (Mya). \"Prodeinotherium\" likely evolved from \"Chilgatherium\", or the common ancestor of the two genera. The earliest remains of \"Prodeinotherium\" come from Kenya, where two deposits preserving the genus date to 22.5 and 19.5 Mya according to one 1978 study. The same study found that fossils from Uganda date to 20.0 Mya. However, more recent studies (from 1988, 1991, and 2002) find that the deposits date to >17.9, 19.5, and 17.0 Mya, respectively. After evolving in Africa, \"Prodeinotherium\" spp. likely migrated into Asia and then Europe with the formation of the \"\"Gomphotherium\" land bridge\". \"Prodeinotherium\" may have gone extinct around 15.5 Mya, based on the last known fossils from the Arabian Peninsula. \"P. hobleyi\" was the first species to evolve, followed soon after \"P. pentapotamiae\" and then \"P. bavaricum\" around the same time. These species are from Africa, Europe, and South Asia, respectively. \"Prodeinotherium\" was replaced in Asia by \"Deinotherium indicum\", in Europe by \"D. giganteum\", and in Africa by \"D. bozasi\".\n\nDeinotheres are quite controversial with regards to the systematics. Many species have been named, yet major studies by Harris and Huttunen find that only three species in each genus are valid, based on distribution and smaller details. Within \"Prodeinotherium\", the species found valid by these authors include \"P. bavaricum\", \"P. pentapotamiae\", and \"P. hobleyi\". Many descriptions of new species of deinotheres are based upon limited material compared to only a small number of the species. Thus, many species of deinotheres are no longer valid. In addition to invalid species, \"Prodeinotherium\" has on occasion been synonymized with \"Deinotherium\". Species of \"Prodeinotherium\" found to be valid by multiple studies include \"P. cuvieri\", \"P. sinense\", and \"P. orlovii\". In a study 2011 analyzed the mandibles of multiple genera in a phylogenetic analysis. Their results are shown below:\n\n\"Deinotherium bavaricum\" was originally mentioned in a paper by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer in 1831. However, his first description of the material came in 1833, in which he also created the new species \"Dinotherium bavaricum\", the accidental change in genus spelling making it a \"lapsus calami\". The material known is the lectotype P3, in the Bayerische Staatssammlung für Paläontologie und historische Geologie, selected from a group of specimens (a syntype) from Bavaria. Meyer compared the tooth to the material of \"Deinotherium gigantium\", and found enough features to distinguish it as a separate species. Most deinotheres were lumped into \"Deinotherium\" until the studies of Harris, who concluded that morphology separated them into two genera, \"Prodeinotherium\" and \"Deinotherium\". As the earliest description of a small deinothere in Europe, \"P. bavaricum\" became the type species of \"Prodeinotherium\". \"Prodeinotherium\" was named in 1830 by Ehik, and its name is derived from \"pro\" – \"before\" \"Deinotherium\" – \"terrible beast\".\n\nAnother early description of \"Prodeinotherium\" is that of Kaup (1832). He described teeth previously assigned to \"Tapir gigantesque\", finding them to be a new deinothere. Kaup assigned these to \"Dinotherium cuvieri\", using size to distinguish it from \"D. giganteum\". However, the size, morphology, and distribution match that of \"P. bavaricum\", thus the latter became the senior synonym. Later in 1836, Lartet described yet another deinothere that eventually became \"P. bavaricum\". This new species was named \"Deinotherium secondarium\", for teeth from France. Lartet published no description, and did not mention this species in later works. Huttunen showed that the distribution of \"D. secondarium\" was within that of \"P. bavaricum\", thus considered the two species likely synonymous. Later, Ehik (1930) described the genus and the new species \"Prodinotherium hungaricum\", misspelling the genus name. The species was known from a jaw with teeth and some post cranial elements. This material was from Királd, and was destroyed, but casts of it remain in the Hungarian Natural History Museum. Diagnosed by dental features, and post cranial morphology, the specimen was later found similar to specimens from elsewhere in Europe, which were assigned to \"P. bavaricum\". Harris found \"P. hungaricum\" to be a synonym of \"P. bavaricum\", a conclusion followed by Huttunen. \"P. petenyii\" was described in 1989 by Vörös, who found it to differ from all other \"Prodeinotherium\" species. From Hungary, the material includes a jaw with teeth. The tooth morphology is very similar to that of \"P. bavaricum\", and although the species has the unique feature of tusks that do not curve down and instead project forwards, Huttunen considered it a synonym of \"P. bavaricum\".\n\nIn 1868, Hugh Falconer's notes from before his death were published, including the description of material that he labelled \"Dinotherium pentapotamiae\". This was from the Sewalik of India, he noted that the teeth were possibly the same as \"D. indium\", but were within the range of a midsized individual. This presumption as \"D. indium\" was based on the possibility that \"D. giganteum\" was the only species of \"Deinotherium\" in Europe, and the variation of individuals of \"Mastodon longirostris\" within a population. This species was later reassigned to \"Prodeinotherium\", distinct from \"D. indicum\".\n\nThe African species, \"P. hobleyi\", was first described in 1911 by Charles William Andrews. The species was from East Africa, and was named \"Dinotherium hobleyi\". Andrews described these remains, which included a mandible with teeth, a calcaneum, a patella, and other indeterminable fragments, shipped to him by C.W. Hobley. It was compared to \"Dinotherium cuvieri\", and although they were similar, the minor differences and geographical separation were enough for Andrews to create a new species. This species was later reassigned to \"Prodeinotherium\", as the only species from Africa.\n\n\"P. sinense\" was described in 2007 as a late species of \"Prodeinotherium\"; it was described by Qui \"et al.\", and is known from dental material and jaw. It was first found in 2005, in Gansu, China. It is of a Late Miocene age, thus is younger than other \"Prodeinotherium\" species. That study also found that the material of \"P. hungaricum\" is distinct from \"P. bavaricum\". A study in 2010 by Vergiev & Markow noted that the teeth are quite similar to those of \"Deinotherium\", and based on these features and age the species was thought to either be a species in between \"Prodeinotherium\" and \"Deinotherium\", or belonging to the latter genus.\n\nEarly depictions of deinotheres such as \"Prodeinotherium\" were scientifically incorrect. Before postcranial material was known, the genera were considered to be rhinos, giant tapirs, sirenians, whales, and marsupials. However, with postcranial material came the proposal of an elephantine relation. However, early depictions of deinotheres were too elephantine, practically only with the addition of lower tusks. These restorations were inaccurate, because they showed the lower lip directly beneath the trunk, with the tusks projecting from the \"chin\". According to a 2001 study, the tusks more likely projected above the lip, which followed the curvature of the jaw down. Another inaccuracy is likely the length of the trunks. Having a long, elephantine trunk was thought of as unlikely by multiple authors, including Harris and the 2001 study. Besides the large opening often associated with a trunk, the general skull structure makes it unlikely for the trunk to be elongated. The upper tusks, retained in all more derived proboscideans, were likely lost so that the upper lip could directly manipulate the food of \"Prodeinotherium\".\n\n\"Prodeinotherium\" was a herbivorous organism. Based on the known distribution of fossils, \"Prodeinotherium\" could only survive along the coast in closed forests. Rodents and fish may have lived in the same environment or region as \"Prodeinotherium\". In Europe, fossils of \"Gomphotherium\" have been found alongside those of \"Prodeinotherium\", showing that the genera likely ate different plants.\n\nDeinotheres were browsers, meaning they ate plants above ground level. Deinotheres possibly ate specific dicots. These could be found in closed woodland forests. The way they chewed their food was probably similar to that of modern tapirs, with the front teeth being used to crush the food, while the second and third molars have a strong vertical shearing action, with little lateral movement. This chewing action differs from both that of gomphotheres (lateral grinding) and elephants (horizontal shearing). Deinothere molars show little wear, indicating a diet of soft, nongritty, forest vegetation, with the down-turned lower tusks being used for stripping bark or other vegetation. The supports for the tusks used in feeding is also based on the fact that juveniles have a different tusk morphology, which is consistent on them likely possessing a slightly different diet or feeding strategy. The trunks of deinotheres were likely similar to a tapirs, which could have been used for grasping plant matter and moving it to where the tongue could manipulate it.\n\n"}
{"id": "2192894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192894", "title": "Whitehall Study", "text": "Whitehall Study\n\nThe Whitehall Studies investigated social determinants of health, specifically the cardiovascular disease prevalence and mortality rates among British civil servants. The initial prospective cohort study, the Whitehall I Study, examined over 17,500 male civil servants between the ages of 20 and 64, and was conducted over a period of ten years, beginning in 1967. A second cohort study, the Whitehall II Study, was conducted from 1985 to 1988 and examined the health of 10,308 civil servants aged 35 to 55, of whom two thirds were men and one third women. A long-term follow-up of study subjects from the first two phases is ongoing.\n\nThe studies, named after the Whitehall area of London and originally led by Michael Marmot, found a strong association between grade levels of civil servant employment and mortality rates from a range of causes: the lower the grade, the higher the mortality rate. Men in the lowest grade (messengers, doorkeepers, etc.) had a mortality rate three times higher than that of men in the highest grade (administrators). This effect has since been observed in other studies and named the \"status syndrome\".\n\nThe first Whitehall Study compared mortality of people in the highly stratified environment of the British Civil Service. It showed that among British civil servants, mortality was higher among those in the lower grade when compared to the higher grade. The more senior one was in the employment hierarchy, the longer one might expect to live compared to people in lower employment grades.\n\nThe first of the Whitehall studies, or Whitehall I, found higher mortality rates due to all causes for men of lower employment grade. The study also revealed a higher mortality rate specifically due to coronary heart disease for men in the lower employment grade when compared to men in higher grades.\n\nThe initial Whitehall study found lower grades, and thus status, were clearly associated with higher prevalence of significant risk factors. These risk factors include obesity, smoking, reduced leisure time, lower levels of physical activity, higher prevalence of underlying illness, higher blood pressure, and shorter height. Controlling for these risk factors accounted for no more than forty percent of differences between civil service grades in cardiovascular disease mortality. After controlling for these risk factors, the lowest grade still had a relative risk of 2.1 for cardiovascular disease mortality compared to the highest grade.\n\nWhitehall I was carried out by the Department of Medical Statistics & Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. The Whitehall Study papers are available to view at the School's archives.\n\nTwenty years later, the Whitehall II study documented a similar gradient in morbidity in women as well as men. The name \"Whitehall II\" was derived from the previous Whitehall study. The Whitehall Studies revealed this social gradient for a range of different diseases: heart disease, some cancers, chronic lung disease, gastrointestinal disease, depression, suicide, sickness absence, back pain and general feelings of ill-health. A major challenge, and a reason for the importance of these studies, was to understand the causes of this social distribution of so many disorders.\n\nWhitehall II is a longitudinal, prospective cohort study of 10,308 women and men, all of whom were employed in the London offices of the British Civil Service at the time they were recruited to the study in 1985. The Study is led by Professor Mika Kivimaki at University College London. The initial data collection included a clinical examination and self-report questionnaire. Since then, twelve waves of data collection have been completed: phase 1 (1984-1985; age 35 to 55), phase 2 (1989-1990), phase 3 (1991-1993), phase 4 (1995-1996), phase 5 (1997-1999), phase 6 (2001), phase 7 (2002-2004), phase 8 (2006), phase 9 (2007-2009), phase 10 (2011), phase 11 (2012-2013), phase 12 (2015-2016). The thirteenth wave began in February 2019. Researchers are continuing to collect further data and samples from the cohort.\n\nResearch continues to explore the pathways and mechanisms through which social position influences health. The research group aims to build a causal model leading from social position through psychosocial and behavioural pathways to pathophysiological changes, sub-clinical markers of disease, functional change, and clinical disease.\n\nThe Whitehall II study began as a study of working age people and investigated the relationships between work, stress, and health. Whitehall II found that the way work is organised, the work climate, social influences outside work, influences from early life, and health behaviours all contribute to the social gradient in health. As participants in this study continue through adult life, the research focuses on inequalities in health and functioning in an aging population. With an increasingly large population of older citizens in the UK, there is an urgent need to identify the causes of social inequalities and to study the long-term effects of previous circumstances on people's ability to function and stay healthy during retirement. Researchers in the Whitehall II team are also considering the role of social inequalities in relation to dementia risk.\n\nThe Whitehall II team have a data sharing policy, allowing researchers from other institutions to use data from the Whitehall II cohort. There is a slightly different data sharing policy for projects that involve genetic information. This policy suggests that the team are engaging with the open access movement, a social movement which is gaining momentum in academia.\n\nThe social gradient in health is not a phenomenon confined to the British Civil Service. Throughout the developed world, wherever researchers have had data to investigate, they have observed the social gradient in health. In order to address inequalities in health, it is necessary both to understand how social organisation affects health, and to find ways to improve the conditions in which people work and live.\n\nMichael Marmot chaired the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH), which was established in 2005 and launched its final report in August 2008. The Commission sought to engage with policy makers, global institutions, and civil society on the issues around health inequalities within and between countries, the social determinants of health, and act to address those issues. The CSDH acted as a catalyst for change, working with countries, academics, and civil society to bring health inequalities to the fore in the national policy dialogue. The overarching goals of the CSDH were to improve population health, to reduce health inequities, and to reduce disadvantages due to ill health.\n\nBy design, the Whitehall studies have been focused upon a single set of related occupations, where the people within each occupational grade tend to be socially similar, yet clear social distinctions between grades are inherent. The studies were designed in this manner as an attempt to avoid certain research drawbacks associated with generalized social class groupings—drawbacks that otherwise would result from the diversity of occupations within social classes—which in turn would tend to reduce the objectivity of any analysis.\n\nThe primary health risks under investigation in the Whitehall studies include cardiovascular function, smoking, car ownership, angina, leisure and hobbies, ECG measurements, and diabetes.\n\nHigh blood pressure at work was associated with greater \"job stress,\" including \"lack of skill utilization,\" \"tension,\" and \"lack of clarity\" in tasks assigned. The higher blood pressure among the lowest grade servants was found to be related to the highest job stress score, whereas blood pressure at home was not related to job stress level.\n\nAccording to Whitehall study researchers, \"a steep inverse association between social class, as assessed by grade of employment, and mortality from a wide range of diseases\" has been demonstrated. Summing up the moral of the Whitehall studies, the researchers concluded that \"more attention should be paid to the social environments, job design, and the consequences of income inequality.\"\n\nSubjects of Whitehall II in the lowest employment grades were more likely to have many of the established risk factors of coronary heart disease (CHD): a propensity to smoke, lower height-to-weight ratio, less leisure time, and higher blood pressure. However, even after normalizing for these factors, the lower employment grades were still at greater risk for a heart attack; another factor was at work.\n\nSome have pointed to cortisol, a hormone produced by the body as a response to stress. An effect of cortisol release is a reduction in the immune system's efficacy through lymphocyte manipulation. One theory explaining the connection between immune-efficiency and CHD is that infectious pathogens, such as herpes or Chlamydia, are at least partially responsible for coronary diseases. Therefore, a body with a chronically suppressed immune system will be less able to prevent CHD.\n\nA study of the cortisol awakening response (the difference between cortisol levels upon awakening and thirty minutes later) further supports the significance of cortisol. Workers showed no significant difference in cortisol levels upon awakening regardless of socioeconomic position. However, the lower employment grades showed significantly higher levels thirty minutes later, particularly if it was a workday. Researchers concluded this was due to chronic stress and its anticipation.\n\nThis seems counter-intuitive: one usually thinks of those with the most decision-making responsibility as the ones with the most stressful lives. One theory is that the lower one is on the chain of command, the less control one has over his or her life. Not having to take orders on how to perform a task, or when to do it, results in lower heart rate, stress hormones, and blood pressure than being told how and when to perform it.\n\nThis theory, however, is not without its detractors. A Finnish study conducted a cohort study similar to Whitehall, but with greater analysis of the worker's stress. The study determined that decision autonomy was not a significant contributing factor to coronary heart disease, but that lack of predictability in the workplace was a significant factor. In the Finnish study, \"predictability\" was defined as high stability of work and lack of unexpected changes, and was found to correlate closely to employment grade.\n\nOthers argue that because there is a strong correlation between low employment grade and domestic stress, stress from a lack of control at work cannot be the whole story. In this line of reasoning, the size of one's paycheck alone could significantly contribute to overall stress. Those with fewer resources have a harder time making ends meet, a situation that can be a tremendous source of chronic anxiety.\n\nAdding to the controversy is the disagreement over the cortisol explanation in the first place. The theory is based on a pathogenic contribution to coronary heart disease and the stressed body's inability to fight it. Follow-up studies on the Whitehall II cohort failed to demonstrate a correlation between pathogen burden and socioeconomic status, whereas other studies in different parts of the world have.\n\nAn alternative to the cortisol explanation is that self-esteem is the major contributing factor and that the link between professional achievement and self-esteem accounts for the health gradient. The study supporting this view correlated low self-esteem in test subjects with greater reductions in heart rate variability and higher heart rates in general—both established coronary heart disease risk factors—while performing stressful tasks.\n\nCurrently there is no universally-accepted cause for the phenomenon brought to light by the Whitehall studies. Clearly, stress is associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease, but so are many other non-traditional factors. Furthermore, “stress” seems to be too nonspecific. There are different kinds of stress in one's day-to-day life and each kind could contribute differently. Vaananen, et al., are making great headway in this regard by researching which components of stress are responsible and which are not.\n\nRegardless of the exact reason why coronary heart disease is more prevalent in lower employment grades, the results of the Whitehall studies have significantly changed the way some doctors approach the evaluation of heart disease risk. By recognizing the effects of psychosocial stressors on the body, in addition to the traditional risk factors, physicians can offer a better assessment of a patient's health.\n\nProfessor Sir Michael Marmot of the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London initiated the Whitehall II study. It is now directed by Professor Mika Kivimaki. Marmot was the commissioner of the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2192895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192895", "title": "The Relativity of Wrong", "text": "The Relativity of Wrong\n\nThe Relativity of Wrong is a collection of seventeen essays on science by American writer and scientist Isaac Asimov. The book explores and contrasts the viewpoint that \"all theories are proven wrong in time\", arguing that there exist degrees of wrongness.\n\nThe book was the twentieth of a series of books collecting essays from \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\". Like most of the essays Asimov wrote for \"F&SF\", each one in \"The Relativity of Wrong\" begins with an autobiographical anecdote which serves to set the mood. Several of the essays form a sequence explaining the discovery and uses of isotopes.\n\nIn the title essay, Asimov argues that there exist degrees of wrongness, and being wrong in one way is not necessarily as bad as being wrong in another way. For example, if a child spells the word \"sugar\" as \"pqzzf\", the child is clearly incorrect. Yet, Asimov says, a child who spells the word \"shuger\" (or in some other phonetic way) is \"less wrong\" than one who writes a random sequence of letters. Furthermore, a child who writes \"sucrose\" or \"CHO\" completely disregards the \"correct\" spelling but shows a degree of knowledge about the real thing under study. Asimov proposes that a better test question would ask the student to spell \"sugar\" in as many ways as possible, justifying each.\n\nLikewise, believing that the Earth is a sphere is less wrong than believing that the Earth is flat, but wrong nonetheless, since it is really an oblate spheroid or a reasonable approximation thereof. As the state of knowledge advanced, the statement of the Earth's shape became more refined, and each successive advance required a more careful and subtle investigation. Equating the wrongness of the theory that the Earth is flat with the wrongness of the theory that the Earth is a perfect sphere is \"wronger than wrong\".\n\nAsimov wrote \"The Relativity of Wrong\" in response to an \"English Literature major\" who criticized him for believing in scientific progress. This unnamed individual is portrayed by Asimov as having taken the postmodern viewpoint that all scientific explanations of the world are equally in error. Irritated, the rationalist Asimov put forth his views in his monthly \"F&SF\" column, and the result became the title essay of this collection.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2192913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192913", "title": "Third Siege of Missolonghi", "text": "Third Siege of Missolonghi\n\nThe Third Siege of Missolonghi (, often erroneously referred to as the Second Siege) was fought in the Greek War of Independence, between the Ottoman Empire and the Greek rebels, from 15 April 1825 to 10 April 1826. The Ottomans had already tried and failed to capture the city in 1822 and 1823, but returned in 1825 with a stronger force of infantry and a stronger navy supporting the infantry. The Greeks held out for almost a year before they ran out of food and attempted a mass breakout, which however resulted in a disaster, with the larger part of the Greeks slain. This defeat was a key factor leading to intervention by the Great Powers who, hearing about the atrocities, felt sympathetic to the Greek cause.\n\nMissolonghi was first besieged by the Ottomans in 1822, then in 1823. In April 1824, Lord Byron died in Missolonghi of an illness, adding to the fame of the city.\n\nIn spring 1825, the Ottomans came to besiege the Greeks again. The Ottoman commander Reşid Mehmed Pasha was informed \"Either Missolonghi falls or your head\" as the Sultan would not tolerate a third failed siege. It was a common practice in the Ottoman empire for those generals who failed the Sultan to pay the price of their failure with their lives. The location of Missolonghi was on a long spit of land surrounded by a lagoon full of islands, giving it a strong defensive position. Three islands, Marmaris, Klisova and Aitoliko controlled the entrance to the lagoon. Much of the ground on the eastern landward side was marshy and on the eastern side was a wide open plain. The town's was surrounded by earthen walls, but their defences had been strengthened by a military engineer from Chios, Michael Kokkinis who had built a series of 17 bastions containing 48 guns and 4 mortars, forming triangular projections so the defender could bring interlocking fire on any attacker. Kokkinis named the bastions after heroes for liberty, naming them after Benjamin Franklin, William of Orange, Tadeusz Kościuszko, Lord Byron, Karl von Normann-Ehrenfels, Markos Botsaris, Skanderbeg, Lord Sheffield, and so on. The defenders were some 3,000 men, most Greek, but a few were Italian, Swiss and German philhellenes. The Greeks were nominally led by a committee of three, but the dominant personality was a Souliot captain Nótis Bótsaris. The Ottoman forces were 20,000, of which 8,000 were professional soldiers, the rest Albanian irregulars while some 4,000 were Greeks enslaved to work on building the Ottoman entrenchments. Reshid promptly put his Greek slaves to work building a series of trenches around Missolonghi that gradually brought his men closer to the town, reaching up to 100 yards of Missolonghi. Reshid was at the end of long and tenuous supply lines and simply did not have enough cannonballs to knock down the walls of Missolonghi. Whenever a breach was made, attempts to storm it were beaten off with ferocious counter-attacks while all the citizens of Missolonghi, men and women worked together to fill the breaches in during the night.\n\nIn August 1825, the Ottomans began building a mound, so they could bring down fire on Missolonghi’s defenders. From the mound, the Greeks were forced out of the Franklin battery, but dug a ditch with a rampart behind, which stopped the Ottomans from advancing too deep into Missolinghi. The Ottomans began building a second mound, but the Greeks destroyed it via a mine full of explosives at the end of August. In the course of night raids, the Greeks dismantled the first mound and used its soil to rebuild holes in their wall. The first mound was finally destroyed by a mine in September 1825. The Ottomans also attempted to mine the walls, but proved to be inept at this. In September 1825, the Greeks dug a mine under the Ottoman camp, in which they exploded a mine. Believing the Greeks were attempting a sortie, the Ottomans gathered around the hole in the earth, at which point the Greeks exploded a second and much larger mine killing many, with one Greek remembering: “We too were terrified and fell to the ground…legs, feet, heads, half bodies, thighs, hands and entrails fell on us and on the enemy”.\n\nAdmiral Miaoulis was able to bring in supplies, so the Ottoman attempt to starve the city into surrender came to nothing. Georgios Karaiskakis, the leading captain of the Roumeli was an enemy of Botsaris, and provided little support for the besieged. In October 1825, the heavy rains turned the Ottoman lines into a quagmire and, feeling confident of victory, the women and children whom Admiral Miaoulis had taken to the island of Kalamos for their safety returned in the fall. One of the Greek captains Dhimitros Makris got married, which led the Greeks to get drunk and fire off blank cartridges all night at the wedding party; in the morning the Turks shouted over the walls to ask what the noise was all about, the Greeks shouted back “It’s the general’s wedding”. The Turks replied “Long life to them! May they be happy!”. Despite the conflict, the two sides would fraternize and talk like old friends during truces. During the truce to celebrate the wedding, the engineer Kokkinis was allowed to visit the Ottoman camp, which he described “as earthworks with no coherence, constructions with no logic, and in short by any reckoning a muddle and a hotchpotch…The whole thing is unbelievable-but it’s Turkish”.\n\nIn the fall of 1825, Mohammed Ali the Great, the more or less independent \"wali\" (governor) of Egypt sent a new fleet of 135 ships, which consisted of Algerian, Tunisian, Turkish and Egyptian ships to join the expeditionary force already in Greece under his son Ibrahim Pasha. Reinforced with 10,000 new Egyptian troops, Ibrahim Pasha marched through the Peloponnese, destroying everything in his path and joined the siege in January. The High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands, Sir Frederick Adam, tried to make both forces sign a treaty, but his efforts were unsuccessful. The Greek Admiral Andreas Miaoulis kept breaking through the Ottoman naval blockade and bringing in supplies. The commander of the Ottoman forces, Reşid Mehmed Pasha, was joined early 1826 by Ibrahim Pasha who crossed the Gulf of Corinth. Ibrahim Pasha had also brought with him many cannons and artillery shells, and on 24 February 1826, the Egyptians began a fierce bombardment of the city. Over the course of three days, the Egyptians fired 5,256 cannon balls and 3,314 mortar shells into the city, destroying much of it. The Greeks defeated three Egyptian attempts to storm the city in hand-to-hand fighting where many men and women stood shoulder to shoulder against the Egyptians.\n\nAt this point, Ibrahim Pasha decided to starve the city into submission. To do that, he needed to take the islands in the lagoon. Ibrahim had a fleet of shallow draught boats numbering 82 and together with five other boats carrying cannons that served as floating batteries. On 9 March 1826, the island of Vasiladhi commanded by the Italian philhellene Pasquale Iacommuzzi consisting of 34 artillerymen and 27 infantry was attacked by 1,000 Egyptians under Hussein Bey. After a day’s fighting, Vasiladhi fell. On 12 March, the Egyptians attacked the islands of Dolmas and Poros, which surrendered after coming under a heavy bombardment. With the islands under Egyptian control, supplies from the sea could no longer reach the city. When the Ottomans captured the fortress island of Anatolikon, Miaoulis was not able to bring in supplies.\n\nIbrahim Pasha now demanded the city surrender, with the people being given the choice of being sold into slavery or converting to Islam, a demand the Greeks rejected. On 6 April 1826, Reshid Pasha led some 2,000 Albanian and Turkish troops onto the island of Klisova, but the Ottoman troops got stuck in the mud as they landed, making them easy targets for Greek snipers with Reshid Pasha himself wounded. After the failure of the first assault, some 3,000 Egyptians under Hussein Bey made a second attempt later that same morning, but were again shot down by the Greeks in the mud banks. The Greeks, knowing that the Egyptians were lost without their officers, concentrated their fire on their leaders and by killing Hussein Bey reduced the Egyptian ranks to chaos. Ibrahim Pasha tried to motivate his soldiers by striking them with his whip and screaming in his fractured Arabic (Ibrahim was an Albanian who never mastered Arabic) that this was a \"jihad\", so the Egyptians should not fear \"martyrdom\" for Allah, and that they were free to rape any Greek Christian who crossed their path. Despite Ibrahim's whip and call for \"jihad\", the Egyptians were unable to get past the mud banks and the assault was finally called off. One Greek Nikolaos Kasomoulis, serving as a secretary to one of the captains described the scene the next day: ”The lagoon was covered with corpses a gunshot distance away, and they were drifting like rubbish by the shore…one could see bodies floating all round, about 2,500 of them, apart from those our boatman had captured and killed at dawn when they cried out for help. Some, 2,500 guns had been found, some with bayonets and some without, plus bandoliers and innumerable belts, from which the Greeks made braces. I made a pair myself, and so did everyone else. But the clothes were worthless, apart from those of a few officers; the Greeks got no booty from these and were much displeased” However, with the Ottomans guarding the islands in the entrance to the lagoon, Admiral Miaoulis could not longer bring in supplies of food and soon the people were starving.\n\nThe situation soon became desperate for the defenders with the people starving. The city had no more cats, dogs, donkeys, or horses as the people had eaten them all. To stay alive, the people were forced to eat seaweed washed ashore, but it failed to provide sufficient nutrients, leaving many to suffer from ulcers, scurvy, diarrhoea, and swelling from the joints. Many of the townsfolk were described as being “skeletal” beings, with pale, livid skin who could barely walk.\n\nAfter around a year of holding out, the leaders of the Greeks, Notis Botsaris, Kitsos Tzavelas and Makris made a plan to escape the city in a conference held at the church of Ayios Spiridhon. When all food supplies had run out and there was no hope of relief, the besieged Greeks decided that some of the menfolk of fighting age should burst out of the gates and attempt to lead the women and children to safety, while the rest would remain to defend the town to the death on 22 April 1826. Georgios Karaiskakis would attack the Turks from the rear and create a diversion while the besieged Greeks would escape the city. Of the 9,000 inhabitants only 7,000 were strong enough to take part. The population consisted of some 3,500 men of military age, 1,000 workers and 4,500 women and children. The plan was that, on the night of 22 April, the people were to charge over the eastern section of the walls, use wooden bridges they carried to cross the Ottoman ditches and then wait for Karaiskakis to come. The exodus was to be divided into three with Dhimitrios Makris leading out the women and children on the right, Kitsos Tsavellas leading the group on the left and Notis Botsaris leading the centre. Those were who were dying and/or too sick were piled into houses packed full of gunpowder to blow themselves up when the Ottomans arrived to kill them. All of the Ottoman prisoners were killed while Bishop Joseph quashed what the British historian David Brewer called \"a crazy plan\" to kill all the women and children and just have the men escape. The Turks had been made aware of the escape plan by deserters, but Ibrahim, preferring that the Greeks escape to spare his forces further fighting, did little to block the Greeks.\n\nWhen night came on 22 April, the moon was obscured by clouds that came in from the sea. In silence, the bridges were dragged over the walls while others threw blankets and pillows into the ditch. Karaiskakis failed to make his promised attack, but the Greeks heard shooting in the hills to the east and assumed he was coming. A thousand soldiers crossed the bridges, followed by the women and children, with the rest all tensely waited for the signal to come out. The clouds now disappeared and the moonlight illuminated the nocturnal exodus, with Karaiskakis still having failed to appear. A cry of \"embros\" (forward) went up and the everyone rushed out, and then somebody shouted \"opiso\" (fall back). When the refugees charged out of the city gates they were fired upon by Turks and Egyptians from defensive positions. Many of the Greeks panicked and fled inside the walls while the Ottoman-Egyptian forces had already entered the city, killing, looting and raping. In the confusion, thousands were trampled to death while others fell into the ditch and drowned. The Ottomans and Egyptians set the city on fire, leading Kasomoulis to remember: “The torch that was Missolonghi shed its light as far as Vasiladhi and Klisova and over the whole plain, and even reached us. The flashes of gunfire looked like a host of fireflies. From Missolonghi we heard the shrieks of women, the sound of gunfire, the explosion of powder magazines and mines, all combined in an indescribably fearful noise. The town was like a roaring furnace”. In the morning, the Ottoman cavalry set off in pursuit of the refugees while, where Karaiskakis was supposed to be, a party of Albanians were waiting to kill the men and to take the women and children to sell into slavery. Of the 7,000 people that tried to escape, only 1,000 made it to safety. The next morning Palm Sunday the Turks entered the city. Many of the Greeks killed themselves by blowing themselves up with gunpowder rather than surrender. The rest were slaughtered or sold into slavery, with the majority of the surviving Greek Christian women becoming sex slaves to Egyptian soldiers. The Turks displayed 3,000 severed heads on the walls.\n\nThough a military disaster, the siege and its aftermath proved a victory for the Greek cause, and the Ottomans paid dearly for their harsh treatment of Missolonghi. After this incident, many people from Western Europe felt increased sympathy for the Greek cause, as manifested for example in the famous Delacroix painting \"Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi\" (1827). The siege of Missolonghi also inspired Gioacchino Rossini's opera \"Le siège de Corinthe\".\n\nThis public sympathy for the Greeks had a significant influence on the eventual decision of Britain, France and Russia to intervene militarily in the Battle of Navarino and secure Greece's independence - with the result that, among other things, within four years Missolonghi fell into Greek hands again.\n\nThe unfinished poem \"The Free Besieged\" by Dionysios Solomos is dedicated to the siege.\nVictor Hugo’s poem ‘’Les Têtes du sérail’’ from his ‘’Les Orientales’’ (1829) celebrates the Greek heroes of the siege.\nThe siege is referenced in the ALPHA 60 song \"Ruins of Missolonghi\".\n\n\n"}

It is long and serves 38 underground stations.\n\nKey points served by the line are \"Duomo\", considered the center of Milan; Castello Sforzesco (with Cairoli station); \"Cadorna\", one of the busiest stations in Milan and in Italy; \"Corso Buenos Aires\" (with stations Porta Venezia, Lima and Loreto), an important shopping street; and Rho Fiera, one of the largest fairgrounds in the world.\n\nOn 6 April 1952 the city administration asked for a project of a metro system and on 6 October 1955 a new company, Metropolitana Milanese, was created to manage the construction of the new infrastructure. The project was funded with ₤ 500 million from the municipality and the rest from a loan. The construction site of the first line was opened in \"viale Monte Rosa\" on 4 May 1957. Stations on the new line were designed by Franco Albini-Franca Helg architecture studio. Bob Noorda designed the famous wayfinding and signage system.\n\nAt first, stations were designed without the mezzanine floor.

{"id": "2192933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192933", "title": "Bardaisan", "text": "Bardaisan\n\nBardaisan (, \"Bardaiṣān\"), known in Arabic as Ibn Daisan (ابن ديصان) and in Latin as Bardesanes (A.D. 154–222), was a Syriac or Parthian gnostic and founder of the Bardaisanites. A scientist, scholar, astrologer, philosopher and poet, Bardaisan was also renowned for his knowledge of India, on which he wrote a book, now lost.\n\nBardaisan ( \"bar Daiṣān\" \"son of the Daiṣān\") was a Syriac author born on 11 July 154, in Edessa, Osroene, which, in those days, was alternately under the influence of both the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire. To indicate the city of his birth, his parents called him \"Son of the Daisan\", the river on which Edessa was situated. He is sometimes also referred to as \"the Babylonian\" (by Porphyrius); and, on account of his later important activity in Armenia, \"the Armenian\", (by Hippolytus of Rome), while Ephrem the Syrian calls him \"philosopher of the Arameans\" (, \"Filosofā d-Arāmāyē\"). Some sources refer to his high birth and wealth; according to Michael the Syrian, Bardaisan's parents had fled Persia and Sextus Julius Africanus reports that he was of the Parthian nobility. His parents, Nuhama and Nah 'siram, must have been people of rank, for their son was educated with the crown-prince of Osroene at the court of Abgar VIII. Africanus says that he saw Bardaisan, with bow and arrow, mark the outline of a boy's face with his arrows on a shield which the boy held.\n\nOwing to political disturbances in Edessa, Bardaisan and his parents moved for a while to Hierapolis (now Manbij), a strong centre of Babylonianism. Here, the boy was brought up in the house of a priest Anuduzbar. In this school he learnt all the intricacies of Babylonian astrology, a training that permanently influenced his mind and proved the bane of his later life. At the age of twenty-five he happened to hear the homilies of Hystaspes, the Bishop of Edessa, received instruction, was baptized, and even admitted to the diaconate or the priesthood. \"Priesthood\", however, may merely imply that he ranked as one of the college of presbyters, because Bardaisen remained in the world and had a son called Harmonius, who according to Sozomen's Ecclesiastical history, was \"deeply versed in Grecian erudition, and was the first to subdue his native tongue to meters and musical laws; these verses he delivered to the choirs\". When Abgar IX, the friend of his youth, ascended the throne (179), Bardaisan took his place at court. While a sincere Christian, he was clearly no ascetic, but dressed in finery \"with berylls and caftan\", according to Ephrem, one of his critics.\n\nBardaisan is said to have converted prince Abgar IX to Christianity (probably after 202, i.e. after his visit and honourable reception at Rome), and even he did not, he had an important share in Christianizing the city. Both king and philosopher laboured to create the first Christian state. However, while he showed great literary activity against Marcion and Valentinus, Bardaisan himself went to create his own heterodox Christian dogma by mixing its doctrines with Babylonian astrology. Other commentators say his philosophy ended up resembling those of Valentinus, if not adhering to them completely. Epiphanius of Salamis and Bar Hebraeus assert that he was first an orthodox Christian and afterwards an adept of Valentinus. As a gnostic, he certainly denied the resurrection of the body, and so far as we can judge by the obscure quotations from his hymns furnished by Ephrem he explained the origin of the world by a process of emanation from the supreme God whom he called the Father of the Living. His teachings formed the basis of the Manichaeism and later of the batini sects of Shia Islam.\n\nBardaisan and his movement were considered heretic by the Christians, and he was subjected to critical polemics. Those claimed, probably falsely, that he became a Valentinian Gnostic out of disappointed ambitions in the Christian church. In particular, he was vigorously combated by St. Ephrem. who mentioned him in his hymns:\nPorphyry states that on one occasion at Edessa, Bardaisan interviewed an Indian deputation of holy men ( \"śramaṇas\") who had been sent to the Roman emperor Elagabalus or another Severan emperor, and questioned them as to the nature of Indian religion. The encounter is described in Porphyry \"De abstin.\", iv, 17 and Stobaeus (\"Eccles.\", iii, 56, 141):\nEventually, after 353 years existence, the Osrhoenic came to an end by the Romans under Caracalla. Taking advantage of the anti-Christian faction in Edessa, captured Abgar IX and sent him in chains to Rome. Though he was urged by a friend of Caracalla to apostatize, Bardaisan stood firm, saying that he feared not death, as he would in any event have to undergo it, even though he should now submit to the emperor. At the age of sixty-three he was forced to take refuge in the fortress of Ani in Armenia and tried to preach there, but with little success. He also composed a history of the Armenian kings. He died at the age of sixty-eight, either at Ani or at Edessa. According to Michael the Syrian, Bardaisan had besides Harmonius two other sons, called Abgarun and Hasdu.\n\nThe followers of Bardaisan (the Bardaisanites) continued his teachings in a sect of the 2nd century deemed heretical by later Christians. Bardaisan's son, Harmonius, is considered to have strayed farther from the path of orthodoxy. Educated at Athens, he added to the Babylonian astrology of his father Greek ideas concerning the soul, the birth and destruction of bodies and a sort of metempsychosis.\n\nA certain Marinus, a follower of Bardaisan and a dualist, who is addressed in the \"Dialogue of Adamantius\", held the doctrine of a twofold primeval being; for the devil, according to him is not created by God. He was also a Docetist, as he denied Christ's birth of a woman. Bardaisan's form of gnosticism influenced Manichaeism.\n\nSt. Ephrem's zealous efforts to suppress this powerful heresy were not entirely successful. Rabbula, Bishop of Edessa in 431–432, found it flourishing everywhere. Its existence in the seventh century is attested by Jacob of Edessa; in the eighth by George, Bishop of the Arab tribes; in the tenth by the historian Masudi; and even in the twelfth by Shashrastani. Bardaisanism seems to have merged first into Valentinianism and then into common Manichaeism.\n\nVarious opinions have been formed as to the real doctrine of Bardesanes. As early as Hippolytus (Philosoph., VI, 50) his doctrine was described as a variety of Valentinianism, the most popular form of Gnosticism. Adolf Hilgenfeld in 1864 defended this view, based mainly on extracts from St. Ephrem, who devoted his life to combating Bardaisanism in Edessa. However, it has been argued that he strong and fervent expressions of St. Ephrem against the Bardaisanites of his day are not a fair criterion of the doctrine of their master. The extraordinary veneration of his own countrymen, the very reserved and half-respectful allusion to him in the early Fathers, and above all the \"Book of the Laws of the Countries\" suggest a milder view of Bardaisan's aberrations.\n\nLike the Early Christians, Bardaisan believed in an Almighty God, Creator of heaven and earth, whose will is absolute, and to whom all things are subject. God endowed man with freedom of will to work out his salvation and allowed the world to be a mixture of good and evil, light and darkness. All things, even those we now consider inanimate, have a measure of liberty. In all of them the light has to overcome the darkness.\n\nShashrastani states: \"The followers of Daisan believe in two elements, light and darkness. The light causes the good, deliberately and with free will; the darkness causes the evil, but by force of nature and necessity. They believe that light is a living thing, possessing knowledge, might, perception and understanding; and from it movement and life take their source; but that darkness is dead, ignorant, feeble, rigid and soulless, without activity and discrimination; and they hold that the evil within them is the outcome of their nature and is done without their co-operation\".\n\nHe apparently denied the resurrection of the body, though believed Christ's body was endowed with incorruptibility as with a special gift. Bardaisan postulated that after six thousand years this Earth shall have an end, and a world without evil would take its place.\n\nBardaisan also thought the sun, moon and planets were living beings, to whom, under God, the government of this world was largely entrusted; and though man was free, he was strongly influenced for good or for evil by the constellations. According to St. Ephrem, Sun and Moon were considered male and female principles, and the ideas of heaven amongst the Bardaisanites were not without an admixture of sensuality (or \"obscenities\"). Led by the fact that \"spirit\" is feminine in Syriac, Bardaisan might have held unorthodox views on the Trinity.\n\nBardaisan apparently was a voluminous author. Though nearly all his works have perished, we find notices of the following:\n\n\n\n"}

The chemistry of helicenes has attracted continuing attention because of their unique structural, spectral, and optical features.\n\nThe systematic naming for this class of compounds is based on the number of rings: [\"n\"]helicene is the structure consisting of \"n\" rings. According to IUPAC, only structures where \"n\" is at least 5 are considered helicenes. Some specific compounds also have alternate or trivial names. As the number of rings increases, starting at four, the structure becomes non-planar, but instead the planes of consecutive rings tilt to prevent steric collisions. The resulting helix is chiral. For helicenes with six benzene units, a 360° turn is completed. In the helicene series the dihedral angles between the extremities increases going from [4]helicene (26°) to [6]helicene (58°) and then decreases again for example in [7]helicene (30°).\n\nHelicenes are notable for having chirality despite lacking both asymmetric carbons and chiral centers. Instead, there is axial chirality, which results from the handedness of the helicity itself. The clockwise and counterclockwise helices are non-superposable. By convention a left-handed helix is \"minus\" and labeled (\"M\"), a right-handed helix is \"plus\" and labeled (\"P\"). Evidence from CD spectroscopy suggests left-handed helices are levorotatory and right-handed helices are dextrorotatory.\n\nThe first helicene structure was reported by Jakob Meisenheimer in 1903 as the reduction product of 2-nitronaphthalene. [5]helicene was synthesized in 1918 by Weitzenböck & Klingler. The first [6]helicene (also called \"hexahelicene\") was synthesized by M. S. Newman and D. Lednicer in 1955 via a scheme that closed the two central rings by Friedel–Crafts cyclization of carboxylic acid compounds. Since then, several methods for synthesizing helicenes with different lengths and substituents are used. The oxidative photocyclization of a stilbene-type precursor is used most often as the key step. The longest helicene, [14]helicene, was prepared in 1975 by this method.\n\nIn one study, [5]helicene was synthesized in an olefin metathesis reaction of a divinyl compound (prepared from 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) in several steps), with Grubbs' second generation catalyst:\n\nOther approach is also non-photochemical and is based on assembly of biphenylyl-naphthalenes and their platinum-catalyzed double cycloisomerization leading to various [6]helicenes:\n\nAcenes are the linear 1,3-fused or meta-analogs of helicenes, and phenacenes are a zig-zag configuration. Conceptually related compounds are the circulenes.\n\nHelicenes have been studied with respect to nonlinear optics, CPL, organocatalysis, conformational analysis, chirality sensing, chemical sensors and hetero-atom substitution \n\n"}

Like his father, he collected information about the genealogies and history of the ancient Arabs. According to the Fihrist, he wrote 140 works. His account of the genealogies of the Arabs is continually quoted in the Kitab al-Aghani.\n\nHisham established a genealogical link between Ishmael and Mohammed and put forth the idea that all Arabs were descended from Ishmael. He relied heavily on the ancient oral traditions of the Arabs, but also quoted writers who had access to Biblical and Palmyran sources. In 1966, W. Caskel compiled a two volume study of Ibn al-Kalbi's \"Djamharat al Nasab\" (\"The Abundance of Kinship\") entitled \"Das genealogische Werk des Hisam Ibn Muhammad al Kalbi\". It contains a prosopographic register of every individual mentioned in the genealogy in addition to more than three hundred genealogical tables based on the contents of the text.\n\n"}

He came to Egypt along with his brother, and held a succession of offices in the Fatimid bureaucracy. He entered the service of Sitt al-Mulk, before becoming secretary to the police chief of Cairo. He was convicted of disloyalty when he opened letters of the secret services in 1013, as a result of which his hands were cut off. However the Caliph al-Hakim soon regretted this harsh punishment, and took him back into the palace and promoted him to high office.\n\nIn 1015/6 he was appointed head of the \"dīwān al-nafaḳāt\" (bureau of expenditure), before rising to the post of \"wāsiṭa\" (the official intermediary between Caliph and the people) in 1021/2, and finally achieving the post of vizier in 1027. He held the post under the caliphs Ali az-Zahir and al-Mustansir until his death in March 1045.\n\nDuring his tenure, after the pacification of Syria by Anushtakin al-Dizbari, al-Jarjara'i, concerned himself with improving relations with the Byzantine Empire. A ceasefire had been in place since 1027, and after fresh fighting in 1036 a peace treaty was agreed. The main point of contention was the suzerainty over the Emirate of the Mirdasids in Aleppo, which both powers made claim to. In practice a kind of dual control came into operation.\n\nAl-Jarjara'i assumed the regency during Caliph al-Mustansir's early reign, though his rule was moderated for its duration by the influence of the caliph's powerful mother Rasad.\n\n"}

It once again featured Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield. The special was first broadcast May 8, 1987 on CBS and was nominated for Outstanding Animated Program at the 39th Primetime Emmy Awards. It has been released on both VHS and DVD home video.\n\nThis was the sixth of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991. In the special, Garfield attempts to raise money to go to Hollywood and appear on \"Pet Search\".\n\nGarfield and Odie believe their dance routines (as performed atop a fence at night) cannot be beaten and so does Jon. They happen to be watching \"Pet Search\" (a pets' version of \"Star Search\") when they come up with a great idea to go on the show after seeing a past winner. Jon is hoping to win the $1,000 prize, which Garfield is unimpressed with. They perform as an Elvis style trio called \"Johnny Bop and the Two-Steps\" (rather reluctantly, because they did not want Jon involved in their act, as they think he's awful at music). Garfield believes it is embarrassing because they all have to wear kitschy 1950's-era costumes.\n\nDespite the silly act, they win the regional competition (after a dog that plays five instruments simultaneously is disqualified after Odie exposes him as just a man in a dog costume) and are able to compete at the national competition in Hollywood. They hit the road to Hollywood and arrive at their fancy Beverly Hills hotel. Garfield and Odie agree that their act is too mediocre to win first prize, so they destroy Jon's guitar when he is not looking, but he gets shocked upon seeing the mess. This allows Garfield and Odie to come up with a better act for the show.\n\nMeanwhile the \"Pet Search\" finals are underway with a different host named Burt and an announcer named Bob. Bob tells Burt about the prizes the top winner will receive including $1,000,000 and the second place winner will receive a boat. While Jon, Garfield. and Odie watch the other competitors, Jon tells them that even though they were happy they won the first \"Pet Search\" contest, $1,000, made it to Hollywood, and would like to take the prizes for first place, he thinks that Garfield and Odie should lose the finals and return to their old lives as a prize of their own, but Garfield disagrees. Garfield and Odie compete in the finals as a tango dancing duo called \"The Dancing Armandos,\" only to receive the boat for second place and lose the top prize package to an opera-singing cat. Angry over losing, Garfield destroys the set, but Jon assures him that they won the boat as a prize. The special ends back home where Garfield finally admits to Jon that it was all for the best that they are home again, as they are on their boat fantasizing about sailing to exotic locations worldwide, despite the fact that they live in a landlocked area and have to settle for sitting on it in the backyard.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Their story is told in the book \"When We Were Thin\" (published 2007 by Hotun Press). The name of the band is a corruption of the Latin American band Alberto y Los Trios Paraguayos.\n\nCreated in 1972 by former member of Greasy Bear – Chris \"C.P.\" Lee and Jimmy Hibbert (vocals, bass) (ex Jacko Ogg and the Head People) and Bob Harding (vocals, guitar, bass), the comedy sketch outfit became a musical group in 1974 and was joined by former Greasy Bear (1968–1972) drummer Bruce Mitchell (drums), with Les Prior (vocals), Simon White (steel guitar, guitar), Tony Bowers (bass, guitar) and Ray \"Mighty Mongo\" Hughes (second drummer). They became a popular support act, supporting Hawkwind on their 1974 tour. The group mercilessly parodied the major rock names of the 1970s – \"Anadin\" (the trade name for an over the counter headache remedy) was a reworking of Lou Reed's \"Heroin\" / \"Sweet Jane\". By 1975 they were topping the bill in their own right and were supported by such acts as The Police, The Stranglers and Blondie. As with many comedy ensembles, the Albertos belied their comic aspirations by their exemplary musicianship, and they released three albums and a variety of spoof discs, culminating in the musical play, \"Snuff Rock\".\n\n\"Sleak (aka Snuff Rock)\", inspired by the then recent film, \"Snuff\", and the concept of snuff movies, but carrying the idea to a band who killed themselves for entertainment, was their musical play presented at London's Royal Court Theatre and Round House, and was famous for the role of the comic disc jockey played by Les Prior. The accompanying EP, \"Snuff Rock\", released on Stiff Records, poked fun at the punk rock phenomenon, targeting the Sex Pistols (\"Gobbing On Life\"), The Damned (\"Kill\") and The Clash (\"Snuffin' Like That\") as well as myriad reggae bands in \"Snuffin' In A Babylon\". They reached the UK Singles Chart with the Status Quo spoof, \"Heads Down No Nonsense Mindless Boogie\" in 1978. Les Prior died in January 1980 from leukaemia, which left a large gap in the group.\n\nAfter their nationally networked TV show \"Teach Yourself Gibberish\" and a crack at America with \"Sleak\", the Albertos disbanded in 1982.\n\nThe band's brand of spoof rock has been said to be in the same English tradition as that of the Barron Knights and the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, but a better comparison might be the American bluegrass/country parody band the Austin Lounge Lizards.\n\n\n\n"}

During his career he advised top Navy officials on essential matters of national defense and was personally thanked by Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy for his efforts.\n\nFor 51 years, Dr. Lyon worked for Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego) and its predecessor organizations. Dr. Lyon started work there less than a year after its June 1940 establishment as the Navy Radio and Sound Lab, as their first Ph.D. physicist. He was charged with forming and directing initial efforts of the Sound Division. The lab was used during World War II for testing, repairing and modifying submarine equipment and harbor defense systems in the Pacific Ocean. During the war, German U-boats in the Gulf of St. Lawrence were undetectable, because sonar failed under the surface ice. Dr. Lyon addressed this problem by designing and testing sonar and oceanographic equipment for the submarine and participating in the ship's first under-ice dives.\n\nHis recommendation initiated an effort that would last over four decades.\n\nIn 1947 Dr. Lyon became head of the Naval Electronics Laboratory's, Submarine Studies Branch in the Research Division.\n\nDr. Lyon had a test pool constructed at Battery Whistler (a converted mortar battery at NEL) to test equipment for deep submergence vehicles like Bathyscaphe \"Trieste\". The pool was equipped to grow sea ice and study its physical properties. In addition, he established a field station at Cape Prince of Wales, Alaska in 1951.\nEquipment and techniques were designed and tested to enable submarine operation in the Arctic Ocean. Brine content and ice elasticity were measured to apply in the design of submarines that could surface through the ice cover. Cold rooms and calibration facilities at the Arctic Submarine Laboratory were used to solve the problem of icing on submarine snorkel head valves. The research culminated in the transpolar submerged voyage of in 1958.\n\nDr. Lyon's career included scores of under-ice cruises to gain scientific knowledge essential to Arctic submarine operations. He and researcher Art Roshon developed an under-ice sonar that allowed completion of the first winter cruise by s. Through the 1970s and 1980s Dr. Lyon's ongoing research at the Arctic Submarine Laboratory resulted in refurbishment and improvement of the Lab's cryogenic facilities. These facilities were used for evaluating icing issues on s, sonar technology developments for remote acoustic measurement of ice thickness, and the ice breakthrough tests for s.\n\nDr. Lyon received major awards including:\n\nHe also received numerous non-governmental awards including:\n\nDr Lyon remained active in Arctic research even after retirement. He collaborated with Dr. William M. Leary on a book detailing development of the submarine Arctic warfare program entitled, \",\" published in January 1999. Less than two weeks before his death, he met with the president of the prestigious Explorer's Club to plan an expedition to the North Pole. They had planned to dive to the sea floor at the Pole. He died at the age of 84 on May 5, 1998. A memorial service was held on June 20, 1998, at the First Unitarian Universalist Church of San Diego. Per his family's wishes, Dr. Lyon's ashes were scattered at the North Pole by on May 3, 1999.\n\nFriends and colleagues of Dr. Lyon have established a memorial scholarship, administered by the UCLA Foundation, to be awarded to a deserving student in the Physics Department at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Dr. Lyon's alma mater.\n\n"}
{"id": "2192998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2192998", "title": "Second Liberian Civil War", "text": "Second Liberian Civil War\n\nThe Second Liberian Civil War began in 1999 when a rebel group backed by the government of neighbouring Guinea, the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD), emerged in northern Liberia. In early 2003, a second rebel group, the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), emerged in the south, and by June–July 2003, Charles Taylor's government controlled only a third of the country.\n\nThe capital Monrovia was besieged by LURD, and the group's shelling of the city resulted in the deaths of many civilians. Thousands of people were displaced from their homes as the result of the conflict.\n\nThe Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed by the warring parties on August 18, 2003 marking the political end of the conflict and beginning of the country's transition to democracy under the National Transitional Government of Liberia which was led by interim President Gyude Bryant until the Liberian general election of 2005.\n\nThe First Liberian Civil War ended with the Liberian general election, 1997 in which Charles Taylor took power.\n\nThe second civil war began in April 1999, when Liberian dissidents under the banner of the Organization of Displaced Liberians invaded Liberia from Guinea. Guinea became LURD’s main source of military and financial support. By July 2000, the various dissident groups had coalesced as the LURD led by Sekou Conneh. The dissidents were thought to be mostly Mandinka and Krahn fighters of the former ULIMO-J and ULIMO-K.\n\nAlso important in forming LURD was an alliance, brokered by ECOMOG-SL Nigerian chief General Maxwell Khobe, between Liberian dissidents and the Sierra Leonean Kamajors hunter militia, including chiefs Samuel Hinga Norman and Eddie Massally. Against the dissidents Taylor deployed irregular ex-National Patriotic Front of Liberia fighters with his more privileged units, such as the Anti-Terrorist Unit, positioned to ensure the irregulars did fight.\n\nSimultaneous September 2000 counter-attacks on Guinea from Liberia and Sierra Leone by RUF – still loyal to Taylor and Guinean dissidents – achieved initial success. By January 2001, however, Taylor’s forces were pushed back inside Sierra Leone and Liberia. The insurgents were posing a major threat to the Taylor government. Liberia was now engaged in a complex three-way conflict with Sierra Leone and the Guinea Republic.\n\nBy the beginning of 2002, both of these countries were supporting LURD, while Taylor was supporting various opposition factions in both countries. By supporting — practically creating — the SL rebels, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Taylor also drew the enmity of the British and Americans. British and U.S. pressure on Taylor increased with rising financial support for Guinea and U.S./U.K.-proposed sanctions, a weaker version of which were imposed by U.N. Security Council May 2001.\n\nBy mid-February 2002 LURD troops were just 44 kilometres from Monrovia, at Klay Junction, and Taylor was forced to declare a state of emergency. The February 2002 ICG report says that this attack was made by pursuing ‘a strategy of infiltration of south-western Liberia through the thick bush of Southern Lofa, looping around government strongholds and disrupting supply lines... while LURD claims between 300 and 500 men were assigned to that mission, ... the number that actually attacked was likely closer to twenty.’ Any image of a large force gradually pushing toward Monrovia is mistaken; ‘hit and run’ raids, rather than a continuous advance, seem to have been the pattern.\n\nThrough the first half of 2002 LURD mounted raids in Bomi, Bong, and Montserrado counties, hitting, in addition to Klay Junction, Gbarnga and Tubmanburg, each time temporarily seizing control from government fighters. In May, an attack on Arthington, less than 20 kilometres from the capital, apparently prompted panic in Monrovia. The state of emergency was lifted in September 2002, after, the government claimed, the township of Bopolu had been retaken.\n\nIn early 2003, a second rebel group, the Ivoirian-backed Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), emerged in the south, and by the summer of 2003, Taylor's government controlled only a third of the country. Despite some setbacks, by mid-2003 LURD controlled the northern third of the country and was threatening the capital. The capital Monrovia was besieged by LURD, and that group's shelling of the city resulted in the deaths of many civilians. Thousands of people were displaced from their homes as a result of the conflict.\n\nA new bout of fighting began in March 2003 after a relative lull and by early May, LURD and MODEL had gained control of nearly two thirds of the country, and were threatening Monrovia. Regional and wider pressure led to the convening of a conference in Accra by the then Chair of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), President John Kufuor of Ghana, on June 4, 2003.\n\nBy July 2003 Monrovia appeared to be in danger of being occupied and devastated despite ongoing peace talks. The U.S. established Joint Task Force Liberia, built around a U.S. navy amphibious group with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard, positioned off the West African coast.\n\nIn July 2003 the United States (US) sent a small number of troops to bolster security around the US embassy in Monrovia, which had come under attack during Operation Shining Express. On July 25, 2003, the Southern Europe Task Force at Vicenza, Italy was designated the lead U.S. Army command for the operation.\n\nOn 29 July 2003, LURD declared a ceasefire. ECOWAS sent two battalions of Nigerian peacekeepers to Liberia. The first Nigerian battalion detached from the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, and the second came from Nigeria itself.\n\nPresident Taylor resigned on August 11, 2003, ahead of the Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) which formed the negotiated end to the war, and was flown into exile in Nigeria. An arrest warrant for Taylor for war crimes committed by his RUF rebel allies in Sierra Leone was later issued by Interpol but Nigeria refused to deport him for a time unless they receive a specific request from Liberia. Vice-President Moses Blah replaced Taylor.\n\nOn August 14, rebels lifted their siege of Monrovia and 200 American soldiers landed to support a West African peace force. Thousands of people danced and sang as American troops and ECOMIL, the Nigerian-led West African forces, took over the port and bridges which had split the capital into government and rebel-held zones. An estimated 1,000 people had been killed in Monrovia between July 18 and August 14.\n\nMoses Blah handed over power to the National Transitional Government of Liberia on October 14, 2003. However, the transitional government exercised no real authority in the country, 80% of which was controlled by the rebel groups. Riots in Monrovia left approximately 16 people dead, with sources claiming that former combatants were behind the violence.\n\nBoth LURD and Charles Taylor made extensive use of children press ganged into military service as soldiers or ammunition porters. The use of child soldiers was prolific by both sides, regardless of prohibitions of the practice in the Geneva Convention. Observers from Human Rights Watch described a deadly and chaotic siege of Monrovia, with many very young fighters shooting \"shiny toys\" they had not been trained to use.\n\nDrugs made up an integral part of Liberian wartime culture. Child soldiers and other combatants were routinely addicted to cocaine, khat, and other drugs as a means of control. Several warlords felt that cocaine made soldiers more effective in battle.\n\nIn November 1997, following the completion of the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia UNOMIL on 30 September, the United Nations established the United Nations Peace-building Support Office in Liberia (UNOL), headed by a representative of the Secretary-General. That first United Nations post-conflict peace-building support office was tasked primarily with assisting the government in consolidating peace following the July 1997 multiparty elections.\n\nOn September 11, 2003, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan recommended deployment of the peacekeeping mission, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), to maintain the peace agreement. The UN Security Council approved the mission on September 19 in Resolution 1509. Nigeria sent in peacekeepers as part of the interim ECOWAS force. UNMIL was made up of over 15,000 personnel, including both military and civilian troops.\n\nThe bulk of the personnel were armed military troops, but there were also civilian policemen, as well as political advisers and humanitarian aid workers. On October 1, the first peacekeepers changed their berets and became a UN force, with many more troops earmarked. During three days of riots in Monrovia in October 2004, nearly 400 people were wounded and 15 killed. The UN slowly built up its forces in the country, with 5,500 projected to be in place by November 2003, and worked to disarm the various factions. However, instability in neighbouring countries, an incomplete disarmament process, and general discontent threatened Liberia's fragile peace.\n\nA group of Liberian women headed by Leymah Gbowee formed an organization called \"Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace\" and forced a meeting with President Charles Taylor, extracting a promise from him to attend peace talks in Ghana. A delegation of women organized nonviolence protests and continued to apply pressure on the warring factions during the peace process. They staged a silent protest outside of the Presidential Palace, bringing about an agreement during the stalled peace talks. Their creative non-violent protest allowed them to use the power within women and mothers of Liberia; tactics included a sex strike until their men chose to set aside weapons, and threatening to undress during a sit in outside the peace talks in Ghana.\n\nWorking together, over 3,000 Christian and Muslim women mobilized their efforts, and as a result, the women were able to achieve peace in Liberia after a 14-year civil war and helped bring to power the country's first female president. The story is told in the 2008 documentary film \"Pray the Devil Back to Hell\". \n\nAmong the women leaders who helped end the civil war was Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who would become the first modern elected female head of state in Africa when she was elected in 2005. Her election was inspired by the powerful commitment of women who had seen the war perpetuated by men in their country and were unwilling to put a man back into that powerful role.\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n\n\n"}

ET245 are formed by three-car consists, with Bo-Bo powered units at both ends and a car between them; normally, two consists are coupled to form a single train.\nThis series came in two different versions for urban and suburban routes. The first had 8 doors per car and regular seats, while the latter was equipped with only 6 doors per car and more seats.\nOriginal ET245 trains are still in service on the line. Of these, some have been renewed in latest years.\n\nThe second type in operation is the new AnsaldoBreda \"Meneghino\" train. The first train was introduced in April 2009.

His mother was Lizetta Young (née Johnson), and his father was Willis Handy Young, originally from Louisiana. Lester had two siblings – Leonidas Raymond, who became a drummer, and Irma Cornelia. He grew up in a musical family. His father was a teacher and band leader, and several other relatives performed professionally.\n\nWhile growing up in New Orleans, he worked from the age of five to make money for the family. He sold newspapers and shined shoes. By the time he was ten, he had learned the basics of trumpet, violin, and drums, and joined the Young Family Band touring with carnivals and playing in regional cities in the Southwest In his teens he and his father clashed, and he often left home for long periods.\n\nYoung left the family band in 1927 at the age of 18 because he refused to tour in the Southern United States, where Jim Crow laws were in effect and racial segregation was required in public facilities. He became a member of the Bostonians, led by Art Bronson, and chose tenor saxophone over alto as his primary instrument. He made a habit of leaving, working, then going home. He left home permanently in 1932 when he became a member of the Blue Devils led by Walter Page.\n\nIn 1933 Young settled in Kansas City, where after playing briefly in several bands, he rose to prominence with Count Basie. His playing in the Basie band was characterized by a relaxed style which contrasted sharply with the more forceful approach of Coleman Hawkins, the dominant tenor sax player of the day. One of Young's key influences was Frank Trumbauer, who came to prominence in the 1920s with Paul Whiteman and played the C-melody saxophone (between the alto and tenor in pitch).\n\nYoung left the Basie band to replace Hawkins in Fletcher Henderson's orchestra. He soon left Henderson to play in the Andy Kirk band (for six months) before returning to Basie. While with Basie, Young made small-group recordings for Milt Gabler's Commodore Records, \"The Kansas City Sessions\". Although they were recorded in New York (in 1938, with a reunion in 1944), they are named after the group, the Kansas City Seven, and comprised Buck Clayton, Dicky Wells, Basie, Young, Freddie Green, Rodney Richardson, and Jo Jones. Young played clarinet as well as tenor in these sessions. Young is described as playing the clarinet in a \"liquid, nervous style.\" As well as the \"Kansas City Sessions\", his clarinet work from 1938–39 is documented on recordings with Basie, Billie Holiday, Basie small groups, and the organist Glenn Hardman. Billie and Lester met at a Harlem jam session in the early 30s and worked together in the Count Basie band and in nightclubs on New York's 52nd St. At one point Lester moved into the apartment Billie shared with her mother, Sadie Fagan. Holiday always insisted their relationship was strictly platonic. She gave Lester the nickname \"Prez\" after President Franklin Roosevelt, the \"greatest man around\" in Billie's mind. Playing on her name, he would call her \"Lady Day.\" Their famously empathetic classic recordings with Teddy Wilson date from this era.\n\nAfter Young's clarinet was stolen in 1939, he abandoned the instrument until about 1957. That year Norman Granz gave him one and urged him to play it (with far different results at that stage in Young's life—see below).\n\nYoung left the Basie band in late 1940. He is rumored to have refused to play with the band on Friday, December 13 of that year for superstitious reasons spurring his dismissal, although Young and drummer Jo Jones would later state that his departure had been in the works for months. He subsequently led a number of small groups that often included his brother, drummer Lee Young, for the next couple of years; live and broadcast recordings from this period exist.\n\nDuring this period Young accompanied the singer Billie Holiday in a couple of studio sessions (during 1937 - 1941 period) and also made a small set of recordings with Nat \"King\" Cole (their first of several collaborations) in June 1942. His studio recordings are relatively sparse during the 1942 to 1943 period, largely due to the recording ban by the American Federation of Musicians. Small record labels not bound by union contracts continued to record and he recorded some sessions for Harry Lim's Keynote label in 1943.\n\nIn December 1943 Young returned to the Basie fold for a 10-month stint, cut short by his being drafted into the army during World War II (see below). Recordings made during this and subsequent periods suggest Young was beginning to make much greater use of a plastic reed, which tended to give his playing a somewhat heavier, breathier tone (although still quite smooth compared to that of many other players). While he never abandoned the cane reed, he used the plastic reed a significant share of the time from 1943 until the end of his life. Another cause for the thickening of his tone around this time was a change in saxophone mouthpiece from a metal Otto Link to an ebonite Brilhart. In August 1944 Young appeared alongside drummer Jo Jones, trumpeter Harry \"Sweets\" Edison, and fellow tenor saxophonist Illinois Jacquet in Gjon Mili's short film \"Jammin' the Blues\".\n\nIn September 1944 Young and Jo Jones were in Los Angeles with the Basie Band when they were inducted into the U.S. Army. Unlike many white musicians, who were placed in band outfits such as the ones led by Glenn Miller and Artie Shaw, Young was assigned to the regular army where he was not allowed to play his saxophone. Based in Ft. McClellan, Alabama, Young was found with marijuana and alcohol among his possessions. He was soon court-martialed. Young did not fight the charges and was convicted. He served one traumatic year in a detention barracks and was dishonorably discharged in late 1945. His experience inspired his composition \"D.B. Blues\" (with D.B. standing for detention barracks).\n\nYoung's career after World War II was far more prolific and lucrative than in the pre-war years in terms of recordings made, live performances, and annual income. Young joined Norman Granz's Jazz at the Philharmonic (JATP) troupe in 1946, touring regularly with them over the next 12 years. He made many studio recordings under Granz's supervision as well, including more trio recordings with Nat King Cole. Young also recorded extensively in the late 1940s for Aladdin Records (1946-7, where he had made the Cole recordings in 1942) and for Savoy (1944, '49 and '50), some sessions of which included Basie on piano.\n\nWhile the quality and consistency of his playing ebbed gradually in the latter half of the 1940s and into the early 1950s, he also gave some brilliant performances during this stretch. Especially noteworthy are his performances with JATP in 1946, 1949, and 1950. With Young at the 1949 JATP concert at Carnegie Hall were Charlie Parker and Roy Eldridge, and Young's solo on \"Lester Leaps In\" at that concert is a particular standout among his performances in the latter half of his career.\n\nFrom around 1951, Young's level of playing declined more precipitously as his drinking increased. His playing showed reliance on a small number of clichéd phrases and reduced creativity and originality, despite his claims that he did not want to be a \"repeater pencil\" (Young coined this phrase to describe the act of repeating one's own past ideas). Young's playing and health went into a crisis, culminating in a November 1955 hospital admission following a nervous breakdown.\n\nHe emerged from this treatment improved. In January 1956 he recorded two Granz-produced sessions including a reunion with pianist Teddy Wilson, trumpet player Roy Eldridge, trombonist Vic Dickenson, bassist Gene Ramey, and drummer Jo Jones – which were issued as \"The Jazz Giants '56\" and \"Pres and Teddy\" albums. 1956 was a relatively good year for Lester Young, including a tour of Europe with Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Quartet and a successful residency at Olivia Davis' Patio Lounge in Washington, DC, with the Bill Potts Trio. Live recording of Young and Potts in Washington were issued later.\n\nThroughout the 1940s and 50s, Young had sat in on Count Basie Orchestra gigs from time to time. The best-known of these is their July 1957 appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival, the line-up including many of his colleagues: Jo Jones, Roy Eldridge, Illinois Jacquet and Jimmy Rushing. In 1952 he was featured on \"Lester Young with the Oscar Peterson Trio\", released in 1954 on Norgran.\n\nLester married three times. His first marriage was to Beatrice Tolliver, in Albuquerque, on 23 February 1930. His second was to Mary Dale.\nHis third wife was Mary Berkeley. They had two children: Lester W. Young Jr. (born 1947) and Yvette Young (born 1957). Both hold a PhD in Education, according to drummer Roy Haynes, who was interviewed as part of an attempt to create a film biography of Young. On January 31, 2008, Sady Sullivan conducted an oral history interview with Dr. Lester W. Young Jr. At approximately 1:10:00 he speaks about his father, listening to jazz, learning to play, and how having a famous father did not convey any favours.\n\nOn December 8, 1957, Young appeared with Billie Holiday, Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster, Roy Eldridge, and Gerry Mulligan in the CBS television special \"The Sound of Jazz,\" performing Holiday's tune \"Fine and Mellow.\" It was a reunion with Holiday, with whom he had lost contact over the years. She was also in physical decline, near the end of her career, yet they both gave moving performances. Young's solo was brilliant, acclaimed by some observers as an unparalleled marvel of economy, phrasing and extraordinarily moving emotion; Nat Hentoff, one of the show's producers, later commented, \"Lester got up, and he played the purest blues I have ever heard...in the control room we were all crying.\"\n\nYoung made his final studio recordings and live performances in Paris in March 1959 with drummer Kenny Clarke at the tail end of an abbreviated European tour during which he ate next to nothing and drank heavily. He died in the early morning hours of March 15, 1959, only hours after arriving back in New York, at the age of 49.\n\nAccording to jazz critic Leonard Feather, who rode with Holiday in a taxi to Young's funeral, she said after the services, \"I'll be the next one to go.\" Holiday died four months later on July 17, 1959 at age 44.\n\nCharles Mingus dedicated an elegy to Young, \"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\", only a few months after his death. Wayne Shorter, then of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, composed a tribute, called \"Lester Left Town\".\n\nYoung's playing style influenced many other tenor saxophonists, including Stan Getz, as well as Zoot Sims, Al Cohn, and Gerry Mulligan. Paul Quinichette modeled his style so closely on Young's that he was sometimes referred to as the \"Vice Prez\" (sic). Sonny Stitt began to incorporate elements from Lester Young's approach when he made the transition to tenor saxophone. Lester Young also had a direct influence on the young Charlie Parker, and thus the entire be-bop movement.\n\nIn 1981 OyamO (Charles F. Gordon) published the book \"The Resurrection of Lady Lester\", subtitled \"A Poetic Mood Song Based on the Legend of Lester Young\", depicting Young's life. The work was subsequently adapted for the theater, and was staged in November of that year at the Manhattan Theater Club, New York City, with a four-piece jazz combo led by Dwight Andrews.\n\nIn the 1986 film \"Round Midnight\", the fictional main character Dale Turner, played by Dexter Gordon, was partly based on Young – incorporating flashback references to his army experiences, and loosely depicting his time in Paris and his return to New York just before his death. Young is a major character in English writer Geoff Dyer's 1991 fictional book about jazz, \"\".\n\nThe 1994 documentary about the 1958 \"Esquire\" \"A Great Day in Harlem\" photograph of jazz musicians in New York, contains many remembrances of Young. For many of the other participants, the photo shoot was the last time they saw him alive; he was the first musician in the famous photo to pass away.\n\nDon Byron recorded the album \"Ivey-Divey\" in gratitude for what he learned from studying Lester Young's work, modeled after a 1946 trio date with Buddy Rich and Nat King Cole. \"Ivey-Divey\" was one of Lester Young's common eccentric phrases.\n\nYoung was the subject of an opera, \"Prez: A Jazz Opera\", that was written by Bernard Cash and Alan Plater and broadcast by BBC television in 1985.\n\nPeter Straub's short story collection \"Magic Terror\" (2000) contains a story called \"Pork Pie Hat\", a fictionalized account of the life of Lester Young. Straub was inspired by Young's appearance on the 1957 CBS-TV show \"The Sound of Jazz\", which he watched repeatedly, wondering how such a genius could have ended up \"this present shambles, this human wreckage, hardly able to play at all\".\n\nOn 17 March 2003, Young was added to the ASCAP Jazz Wall of Fame, along with Sidney Bechet, Al Cohn, Nat \"King\" Cole, Peggy Lee and Teddy Wilson. He was represented at the ceremony by his children Lester Young Jr and Yvette Young.\n\nLester Young is said to have popularized use of the term \"cool\" to mean something fashionable. Another slang term he coined was the term \"bread\" for money. He would ask, \"How does the bread smell?\" when asking how much a gig was going to pay.\n\n\nWith the Count Basie Orchestra\nWith Jazz at the Philharmonic\nWith Billie Holiday\n\n\n\n"}

His father was Plácido Caballero, a Cuban whose mother was of European descent and whose father was from Cantabria. His mother was Julia Bonald, a descendant of Viscount Louis Gabriel Ambroise de Bonald, a traditional French philosopher who settled in Andalucia in the middle of the 19th century.\n\nBetween 1936 and 1943, he studied at the Marianistas de Jerez School. During the Spanish Civil War, he spent some time in the Sierra de Cádiz and in Sanlúcar de Barrameda. He read the first books that were to influence him: Jack London, Emilio Salgari, Robert Louis Stevenson, and José de Espronceda.\n\nBetween 1944 and 1948, he undertook nautical studies in Cádiz, and he wrote his first poems. He made friends with members of the Cádiz magazine \"Platero\", namely Fernando Quiñones, Pilar Paz Pasamar, Felipe Sordo Lamadrid, Serafín Pro Hesles, Julio Mariscal, José Luis Tejada, Francisco Pleguezuelo and Pedro Ardoy.\n\nCaballero spent his military service in the Milicia Naval Universitaria and spent two summers sailing in the waters of the Canary Islands, Morocco and Galicia. His military career was curtailed when he contracted a lung illness and travelled to Jerez to recuperate.\n\nBetween 1949 and 1952, he studied philosophy and literature in Seville.\n\nHe continued his studies of literature in Madrid and worked on the First Biennial Latin-American Art Festival.\n\nAround 1954 he served as Secretary and later as Deputy Editor of the \"Papeles de Son Armadans\" magazine.\n\nIn 1959 he began to make friends with and collaborate with poets who would later make up the \"Generation of 1950\". This group of literary figures were united in their political opposition to the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.\n\nIn February 1959 in Collioure (France), he attended the 20th anniversary of the death of Antonio Machado, along with Blas de Otero, José Agustín Goytisolo, Ángel González, José Ángel Valente, Jaime Gil de Biedma, Alfonso Costafreda and Carlos Barral.\n\nHe moved to Bogotá, where he taught Spanish literature and humanities at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

He published the \"Narrativa Cubana de la Revolución\" (Cuban Narrative of the Revolution) in 1968, and was again arrested for political reasons, and imprisoned for one month in Carabanchel jail.\n\nIn 1971 he began working for the Lexicography Seminar of the Royal Spanish Academy, where he stayed until 1975. In 1973 he also started working as literary editor for Júcar Publications, a position which he also occupied until 1975. He gave courses on narrative in several European universities and attended literary symposia.\n\nHe worked as a Contemporary Spanish Literature Professor at the Centre for Hispanic Studies at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania from 1974 to 1978. That year he was appointed President of the PEN Club Español (from which he resigned in 1980). In Madrid, the National Drama Center performed his version of \"Abre el Ojo\" (Open Your Eye), by Rojas Zorrilla.\n\nBetween 1985 and 1988 he once again spent some time in the United States. In 1989 a high school bearing his name was inaugurated in Jerez. A public library bearing his name was inaugurated in Marbella in 1992.\n\nIn 1993 he was appointed corresponding member of the North American Spanish Language Academy. The National Classic Theatre Company performed his version of \"Don Gil de las Calzas Verdes\" (Sir Gil of the Green Stockings) by Tirso de Molina. The Sanlúcar de Barrameda Town Council named a street after him.\n\nIn 1997 the Antonio Gades Company performed his ballet adaptation of Fuenteovejuna.

He lives in London. He was a key player in preparing the “Letter of Demands” of 1991 and the \"Memorandum of Advice\" the following year. Both documents were endorsed by a considerable number of prominent figures, including Sheikh Bin Baz, Al-Uthaymeen and Salman Al-Ouda, and were then presented to the king at the time Fahd. In 1994, the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights was established and Al-Faqeeh was appointed as the head of its London office, with another Saudi dissident Mohammad al-Massari as the spokesperson.

Two days later, the names of al-Faqih and MIRA were added to the UN 1267 Committee's list of individuals and entities belonging to or associated with al-Qaeda. The Treasury statement mentions al-Faqih's past affiliation with Osama bin Laden, Khalid al-Fawwaz, Mustafa Setmariam Nasar, and an obscure al-Qaeda ideologue who writes, or used to write, under the name Lewis Attiyatullah. Sa'ad Al-Faqih asserts that authorities, such as the United States government, wish to vilify him because they are allies with the current Saudi regime, which he opposes and denies all allegations.\n\n\"BBC five\" reported a claim that in 1996 Saad Al Faqih purchased an Exact-M 22 satellite phone for Osama bin Laden, an allegation which has not even been investigated, nor has he been charged by any court in the world.\nAl-Faqeeh confirms that he and MIRA are \"totally committed to peaceful agenda.\".\n\nHe has since been removed from the UN sanctions list after the UN Security Council committee accepted the Ombudsman's recommendation to have him removed. The committee's chairman, German Permanent Representative Peter Wittig, announced in a statement on 3 July 2012 that \"after thorough consideration\" Dr Al-Faqih and Mira had been removed. \"The key question the committee has to consider is whether there is sufficient information to provide a reasonable and credible basis for concluding that an individual, group, undertaking, or entity is associated with al-Qaeda,\" he added. The UK and Germany reportedly supported Dr Faqih's removal, while the US and Saudi Arabia were among those who opposed it. Dr Al-Faqih said it had been a \"laborious battle\" to get off the sanctions list.\n\"All that has happened in the last eight years is that an innocent, peaceful activist, acting within the law, has been a victim of a conspiracy by tyrants in the Gulf supported by superpowers,\" he told the Reuters news agency. \n\n"}

In 1986, Morgan Stanley licensed the rights to the indexes from Capital International and branded the indexes as the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) indexes. By the 1980s, the MSCI indexes were the primary benchmark indexes outside of the US before being joined by FTSE, Citibank, and Standard & Poor's. After Dow Jones started float weighting its index funds, MSCI followed. In 2004, MSCI acquired Barra, Inc., to form MSCI Barra. In mid-2007, parent company Morgan Stanley decided to divest from, and perhaps spin off, MSCI. This was followed by an initial public offering of a minority of stock in November 2007.

Initially the domestic Chinese companies received a 5% weighting in the index even though the stated methodology called for a 40% weighting. While MSCI is the last major index provider to include the companies, the decision has proved controversial due to the fact that many Chinese listed companies refuse to permit the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to inspect their financial records, thereby sparking criticism and questions from Senator Marco Rubio and others. In February 2019, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported the decision was the result of pressure from the Chinese government. In March 2019, CNBC reported that MSCI would quadruple the weightings of mainland Chinese shares in its global benchmarks.

The town is the headquarters of Bardez Taluka. It is located on the main highway NH-17, linking Mumbai to Kochi.\n\nIn Portuguese, the town is known as Mapuça.\n\nMapusa is a small town clustered around the Mount (Alto). The name Mapusa is thought to be derived from the Konkani word for a 'measure' - 'map' and the phrase fill up - 'sa'. Ancient Goan agrarian community had a well established \"Gaunkari\" or Community Farming System, where villages formed associations, worked on community land and shared profits. Market day was a major event, with goods brought in from every district to one central area. Mapusa has thus remained a prominent market center for many centuries.\n\nMapusa is located at . It has an average elevation of 15 metres (49 feet).It lies on the banks of Mapusa River.\nMapusa has a tropical climate with temperatures ranging from a high of 37 °C in summer with high levels of humidity to a low of 21 °C in winters.\n\n India census, Mapusa had a population of 40,487. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Mapusa has an average literacy rate of 76%, higher than the national average of 74.04%: male literacy is 80%, and female literacy is 73%. In Mapusa, 11% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\nMapusa is close to one of the main centres of Goa's tourism industry. Mapusa's proximity to many beaches in the north of Goa makes it a suitable base during the tourist season (November to April). Because it is a mainly commercial town (for locals) with a large resident population, Mapusa has only a limited number of hotels and accommodation.\nMapusa comes alive on Friday, the traditional market day also known as Mapusa Friday Market. People from surrounding villages and towns come to Mapusa to sell their wares. This fair has a lot of local flavour (unlike some other tourist-oriented fairs or markets) and specialises in agricultural produce, vegetables, locally grown fruit, spices, clothes and even plants (mainly during the monsoon planting season).\n\nEvery Friday, the Mapusa Market bulges at the seams, with seemingly every square inch of space occupied by sellers with only just enough room for the prospective buyers, the alleys between the regular stalls being occupied with temporary mats and boards. From lottery tickets displayed in great swathes to barber shops, the bazaar caters for almost every requirement imaginable. There is the fish street, dried fish of all possible varieties and whole fresh fish from baby shark and squid to the ubiquitous bangda (mackerel). Fresh fruit and vegetables are gathered together and beautifully displayed, from huge sweet potatoes, and pumpkins and the local shiny red brown Moira bananas to the tiny fresh beans and other pulses.\n\nMapusa houses several prominent Goan educational institutions, including Saraswat Vidyalaya, St. Mary's Convent High School, St. Britto's High School, New Goa High School, St. Antony's High School, Mapusa High School, Dyanprasarak High School, Shree Ganesh Vidya Mandir, DMC Higher Secondary and college of Art, Science and Commerce, St. Xavier's College, and St. Xavier's Higher Secondary School, Agnel Institute of Technical Education (Engg College).\n\nMapusa, however, does not have too many tourist sites. There are a few colonial era Municipal building on the Altinho hill, but it is a fairly small town with mostly modern buildings spread around the slopes of Altinho.\n\nThe most famous local shrine is Shree Dev Bodgeshwar Sansthan of Lord Bodgeshwar, located on the outskirts of the town in the middle of some rice fields, which is beautifully lit up at night and draws thousands of devotees for its annual Jatra.\n\nThe Church of Our Lady of Miracles, founded in 1594 and rebuilt several times since, located around 600m east of the Municipal Gardens, is famous more for its annual festival than for its architecture. It was built by the Portuguese on the site of an old Hindu temple, and thus the Hindu community still holds the site as sacred. On the sixteenth day after Easter, the church's annual feast day is celebrated here by both Hindus and Christians – one of the best examples of the way in which Hinduism and Christianity often coexist merrily in Goa.\n\nMaruti Temple, in the centre of town, is a small, pastel-coloured Maruti temple that was built in the 1840s at a site where Hanuman was covertly worshipped during more oppressive periods of Portuguese rule. After temples had been destroyed by the Portuguese, devotees placed a picture of Hanuman at the fireworks shop that stood here, and arrived cloaked in secrecy to perform pujas (prayers). In April 1843 the picture was replaced by a silver idol and an increasing number of worshippers began to gather here. Eventually the business community of Mapusa gathered enough funds to acquire the shop, and the temple was built in its place. The intricate carvings at the doorway of the temple are the work of local artisans.\n\nThe Mapusa Market gathers Goan traders as well as merchants from adjacent states for goods such as spices, toddy and home-grown goods. For example, there are four varieties of locally growned bananas sold in this market and other varieties imported from Karnataka. There is also a part of the market where the traders specialise in repairing ustensiles such as blenders and food mixers for the preparation of spices. \n\n"}

It may also be used varyingly as a disinfectant, sanitizer, microbicide (or microbistat), virucide or insecticide. It is also used as an effective herbicide where its action is to modify the waxy cuticle of plants, resulting in desiccation.\n\nPine oil is distinguished from other products from pine, such as turpentine, the low-boiling fraction from the distillation of pine sap, and rosin, the thick tar remaining after turpentine is distilled.\n\nChemically, pine oil consists mainly of α-terpineol and other cyclic terpene alcohols. It may also contain terpene hydrocarbons, ethers, and esters. The exact composition depends on various factors, such as the variety of pine from which it is produced and the parts of the tree used.\n\nPine oil is a disinfectant that is mildly antiseptic. It is effective against \"Brevibacterium ammoniagenes\", the fungi \"Candida albicans\", \"Enterobacter aerogenes\", \"Escherichia coli\", Gram-negative enteric bacteria, household germs, Gram-negative household germs such as those causing salmonellosis, herpes simplex types 1 and 2, influenza type A, influenza virus type A/Brazil, influenza virus type A2/Japan, intestinal bacteria, \"Klebsiella pneumoniae\", odor-causing bacteria, mold, mildew, \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\", \"Salmonella choleraesuis\", \"Salmonella typhi\", \"Salmonella typhosa\", \"Serratia marcescens\", \"Shigella sonnei\", \"Staphylococcus aureus\", \"Streptococcus faecalis\", \"Streptococcus pyogenes\", and \"Trichophyton mentagrophytes\".\n\nIt will kill the causative agents of typhoid, gastroenteritis (some agents), rabies, cholera, several forms of meningitis, whooping cough, gonorrhea and several types of dysentery. It is not effective against spore related illnesses, such as tetanus or anthrax, or against non-enveloped viruses such as poliovirus, rhinovirus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.\n\nIndustrially, pine oil is used as a frother in mineral extraction from ores. For example, in copper extraction pine oil is used to condition copper sulfide ores for froth flotation. Therefore, it is important in the industry for the froth flotation process. It has largely been replaced by synthetic alcohols and polyglycol ethers.\n\nPine oil has a relatively low human toxicity level, a low corrosion level and limited persistence; however, it irritates the skin and mucous membranes and has been known to cause breathing problems.

Of these 5 lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of Siraj-ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, it purchased these villages in 1758 from Mir Jafar, and reorganised them. These villages were known en-bloc as \"Dihi Panchannagram\" and Ballygunge was one of them. It was considered to be a suburb beyond the limits of the Maratha Ditch. Beltala was a village in Dihi Mohanpur (later Monoharpukur).\n\nBallygunge grew up around a market for sand (\"bali\" in Bengali) and had garden-houses of 18th century Europeans. Amongst the prominent residents were George Mandeville, the zamindar/ collector, and Colonel Gilbert Ironside, a friend of Warren Hastings. In 1840, Emily Eden called Ballugunge 'our Eltham or Lewisham'. It also emerged as a citadel of the educated Bengali middle class after the suburban railway opened up the area.\n\nIn 1888, Ballygunge and Tollygunge had a combined \"thana\" (police station).\n\nEntally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, parts of Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watgunge and Ekbalpur, and parts of Garden Reach and Tollygunge were added to Kolkata Municipal Corporation in 1888. Garden Reach was later taken out.\n\nWhen the Bengal Renaissance started taking roots in 19th century Calcutta, it was initially limited to the predominantly Hindu 'Indian town' stretching north and north-east from the fringes of Burrabazar, with a somewhat later extension south and south-east of the 'European town' to Bhowanipore, and some decades later to Ballygunge, which was then developing as a suburb.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, “in the milieu of relative urban prosperity... Calcutta’s rich citizens – those connected with jute, coal, tea, other industries, trade, money-lending and rentier income from urban property – did fabulously well for themselves.” Large chunks of Ballygunge, Sunny Park, Rainey Park and Southern Avenue were developed during the 1930s and 1940s. Many of the mansions in Ballygunge, Bhowanipore and Alipore were built by the city’s Bengali and new Marwari elite who wanted to move from the “dirtier sections of north Calcutta to the more fashionable areas in the south”.\n\nBallygunge is flanked by Park Circus in the north, Kasba and the Eastern Railway south suburban line in the east, Dhakuria and the Lakes (now called Rabindra Sarobar) in the south, and the localities of Bhowanipore and Lansdowne in the west.\n\nThe following police stations in the Ballygunge area, which are part of the South-east division of Kolkata Police, cover four police districts in the area:\n\nRabindra Sarobar police station is a new police station being set up in the Rabindra Sarobar area.\n\nKaraya Women police station, has jurisdiction over all police districts under the jurisdiction of the South-east division, i.e. Topsia, Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Gariahat, Lake, Karaya, Rabindra Sarobar and Tiljala.\n\nAs of 2018, the price of residential property in Ballygunge is amongst the neighbourhoods with high prices in Kolkata, and the price has more than doubled in the last decade.\n\nGariahat market, spread along Rashbehari Avenue, Gariahat Road and the lanes in the area, is one of the largest and busiest markets in Kolkata.

Over the next four decades he took charge of several club and national teams, including Athletic Bilbao which he also represented as a player, Espanyol and Spain. He won the La Liga championship in 1983 and 1984 with the former.\n\nNicknamed \"El rubio de Barakaldo\" (The blond from Barakaldo) per his hair colour and town of origin, Clemente coached the Spanish national side in two World Cups and Euro 1996.\n\nBorn in Barakaldo, Biscay, Clemente joined Athletic Bilbao's youth system at the age of 16, from local Barakaldo CF. He was propelled to the first team at only 18 by manager Agustín Gaínza, making his official debut against Liverpool for the season's Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (2–1 home win, 3–3 aggregate triumph); along with fellow teenage newcomer José María Igartua, he was selected for the 1969 Copa del Generalísimo Final against Elche CF, a 1–0 victory in Madrid.\n\nClemente's best La Liga output with his first and only club consisted of 18 games in the 1969–70 campaign. On 23 November 1969, during a league match against CE Sabadell FC, he suffered a serious leg injury (fibula and tibia) from which he never fully recovered; after four unsuccessful operations, he retired aged just 24.\n\nClemente started coaching immediately after retiring. His first stops were with local Arenas Club de Getxo, CD Basconia and Athletic's reserves.\n\nIn summer 1981, 31-year-old Clemente was appointed at Athletic Bilbao. He led the side to back-to-back national championships in his second and third years but, during this timeframe, also began a bitter rivalry with César Luis Menotti and his FC Barcelona – the Argentine criticized his playing style as authoritarian and his teams as defensive and destructive, and the Spaniard in turn dismissed Menotti as an ageing hippy and womanizer; the culmination of this was the 1984 final of the Copa del Rey, which ended in a massive brawl between the two sets of players.\n\nClemente left the Lions midway through the 1985–86 season, after a run-in with star player Manuel Sarabia. He was subsequently appointed at fellow league team RCD Espanyol, leading them to a best-ever third place in 1987 and the final of the UEFA Cup the following year, but being relieved of his duties in March 1989 after questioning his squad's desire – the campaign eventually ended in relegation for the Catalans.\n\nIn the following years, Clemente had incomplete top flight spells with Atlético Madrid, a return to Athletic Bilbao, and Espanyol.\n\nIn 1992 Clemente was appointed manager of Spain, replacing Vicente Miera after the nation had failed to qualify for UEFA Euro 1992. His first game in charge was a 1–0 friendly win over England on 9 September, and he led the country to the following three major international tournaments, the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World Cups and Euro 1996, being eliminated in the group stage of the second competition and having a run of 31 matches without defeat.\n\nClemente's last game in charge was on 5 September 1998, a 2–3 defeat in Cyprus for the Euro 2000 qualifiers.\n\nClemente returned to club action after his national team dismissal, working in the main division with Real Betis, Real Sociedad, CD Tenerife, Espanyol for a second time, a one-season spell in Ligue 1 with Olympique de Marseille, and back with Athletic Bilbao. He helped the latter avoid relegation in the 2005–06 season but, shortly before the new campaign started, was fired after a disagreement with chairman Fernando Lamikiz.\n\nOver his three spells in charge at San Mamés, Clemente was manager in 289 official matches, which set a club record. This was broken in 2017 by Ernesto Valverde, who also surpassed his total of 211 league matches managed, finishing on 228, but was unable to match his record of victories: the former won 141 games – 102 in the league – while the latter came up one short, with 140 and 101.\n\nClemente became manager of the Serbia national team on 21 July 2006, being brought in on initiative from Serbian Football Association president Zvezdan Terzić. According to local media his salary was €30,000 per month on a two-year contract, worth €720,000 in total – also, he was eligible for a €400,000 bonus if the country qualified for Euro 2008, and an additional €150,000 bonus for every round passed at the tournament; in an interview given to Serbian daily \"Politika\", he claimed his current was the lowest wage he had earned in the last 20 years.\n\nClemente made his debut on 16 August 2006 in a 3–1 away friendly victory with Czech Republic. New players introduced into the squad included Danko Lazović, Marko Pantelić, Vladimir Stojković and Aleksandar Trišović, while previous mainstays such as Predrag Đorđević, Dragoslav Jevrić, Mateja Kežman, Savo Milošević and Albert Nađ were dropped. The continental qualification campaign started with three home wins, over Azerbaijan, Belgium and Armenia, and a draw in Poland from the first four matches; however, things started to go wrong with a 1–2 defeat in Kazakhstan in March 2007, and the nation eventually trailed Poland and Portugal in Group A, with the manager questioning the side's mental approach in the process.\nFollowing the failure to qualify, Clemente was released from his contract on 6 December 2007.\n\nOn 17 August 2010, following spells in his country with Real Murcia (top level and Segunda División) and Real Valladolid (eight games in charge, top flight relegation), Clemente was named as the new coach of Cameroon, taking over from Paul Le Guen who stepped down after three losses in as many games in the 2010 World Cup. He made his debut with the \"Lions Indomptables\" on 4 September in a 3–1 away win against Mauritius in the first match of the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. However, the nation finished second behind Senegal and thus failed to reach the finals in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and he was dismissed on 25 October 2011.\n\nOn 13 February 2012, Clemente signed as the new manager of Sporting de Gijón, with a contract running until the end of the season. He left the Asturians in May, following their relegation; in the process he celebrated his 500th game in the Spanish first division, a 1–2 away loss to Granada CF.\n\nOn 20 September 2013, Clemente was named manager of Libya, taking over from Abdul-Hafeedh Arbeesh who was fired after a 0–1 defeat to Cameroon for the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign.

At the 2015 local government reform it became a subdivision and the seat of the municipality Malësi e Madhe. It was the seat of the former Malësi e Madhe District. The population at the 2011 census was 3,734. It is situated north of the city of Shkodër. As of June 2016, Koplik has been registered and administrated as an international 'free economic trade zone' by the Albanian government.\n\nCupionich was mentioned by Mariano Bolizza in 1614, being part of the Sanjak of Scutari. It was Roman Catholic, had 60 houses, and 130 men at arms commanded by Pecha Campersa.\n\nKoplik was thought to have been founded sometime in the 14th century by Tsar Stephan Dushan of Serbia.\n\nKoplik, being a border town, has a long history of warfare. The historical importance of Koplik owes much to the Malissori tribesmen. Their fierce independent nature insured that Koplik was often embroiled in wars against the Ottomans and the Serbs though much of its history. In the town itself there is a monument commemorating the Battle of Koplik, also known as the Battle of Deçiq on account of being fought both in Koplik and Tuzi. The battle was a result of a rebellion of Malsori tribesmen led by Ded Gjo Luli of the Traboin-Hoti tribe against Ottoman imperial authority. The battle was a costly victory for the Malsori tribesman. After the first world war and the partition of Malsia e Madhe into two component parts, the area surrounding Tuzi was given to the Kingdom of Montenegro whilst the area around Koplik remained Albanian with Koplik being created the regional capital of Malsia e Madhe. During the Ottoman occupation, many of the inhabitants of the town converted to Islam, although the rural population in Malësia e Madhe continued to be mainly Catholic. The communist regime put heavy restrictions on mobility but after the fall of communism in 1991, Koplik experienced a great influx of new settlers from the countryside.\n\nIn 1984, Koplik was elevated to city status, with a municipality granted following the first democratic elections on 26 July 1992.\n\nLake Shkodër and the mountainous areas of the Malëia e Madhe are recreational areas. Koplik receives hundreds if not thousands of tourists every year. These are however mainly expatriate immigrants returning to see family. Koplik and the surrounding areas have seen investment with a casino as well as restaurants being built to accommodate the increased demand from the tourist influx during the summer months. Koplik is a starting point for hikers wishing to explore the literary famous Malsia e Madhe, translated in English as the \"Great Highlands\" which receive much literary attention most famously in the travels of the early female anthropologist Edith Durham in her book \"High Albania\" as well as others including Lord Byron, Margaret Hasluck and many native figures. Malsia e Madhe is an area that offers hiking opportunities.\n\nRoads were poor; however in recent years, government investment has improved the central highway running through the province as well as the asphalting of most village roads. There is no availability to passenger trains from Koplik itself. The main method of public transportation is the use of minibuses on the main highway with one arriving every 3 to 5 minutes on average. Each minibus is usually privately owned and operated so there are no fixed fares as such; passengers are expected to pay the market price depending on the length of journey with the price from Koplik to the village of Dober (about a 2 to 3-mile journey) being around 20 lek.\n\nKoplik is the trading center of Malsia e Madhe. It is generally the place where from the rural villages go for anything from buying household items, clothing and other everyday things to attaining services such as health care, haircuts etc. As a result, Koplik is filled with shops, restaurants and hardware stores as well as Internet cafes and a casino. It has branches from the major banks operating in Albania. It also has a variety of business from a few hunting shops for the purchase of licensed fire arms and ammunition to mobile phone shops, bureau de change to a variety of high-street stores to be found in most major settlements. Further, the main high school for the surrounding villages is located there. As a result of Koplik's trade and administrative center status, it benefits from a constant influx of people from the surrounding area. It is also a transport hub as it is somewhat of a gateway into the deep valleys of Malsia itself and therefore a place of congregation for the various minibuses with at least half a dozen being present there at any time in the day.\n\nThe football city club is KS Veleçiku Koplik.\n\nThe municipality of Koplik has its own website, , which allows users to see who is employed by the local government and also view its budget and other administrative information.\n\n"}

Beneath the line of white bars is very thin, and the brick-red submarginal band of the hindwing is placed between two rows of black spots, which are thinly edged with bluish white, and is sometimes continued on to the forewing. Throughout Central and South Europe, from the Atlantic coast and Great Britain throughout Europe and Asia to Amurland and Corea; but absent from North Africa and probably also from Japan, the specimens recorded from the latter country presumably belonging to \"mera\" or \"prunoides\" In ab. \"fulvior\" Tutt (particularly females) the forewing bears an orange-yellow discal patch, the rest of the wing being dusted with golden brown. In ab. \"ptorsas\" Hfngl. both wings have a reddish yellow submarginal band above; transitional specimens have an incomplete band (ab. \"progressa\", \"excessa\"). ab. \"obsoleta\" Tutt has no reddish yellow anal spots above, while these spots are pale yellow instead of red in ab. \"lutea\" Tutt. A \"lutea\" specimen in which the underside is dull and has no black spots on the proximal side of the band on the hindwing has received the name ab. \"paupera\" Tutt, and individuals with a broad white macular band on the underside parallel to the outer margin are ab. \"albofasciata\" Tutt. — Egg quite flat, chagreened, greyish brown, with the top concave; deposited singly or in pairs. Larva woodlouse-shaped, green, with a darker\ndorsal stripe, at the sides of which there are small brown warts or tubercles; from April till the end of May on Blackthorn and Plumtrees. It has been observed to attack other pruni larvae which had fastened themselves before moulting (Frohawk). Pupa anteriorly somewhat angular, black-brown, with darker markings and a pale saddle-patch, the abdomen being tuberculate and strongly raised, the whole resembling a small bud or bird-droppings. The butterflies appear in June, usually flying singty, being so abundant however in certain years that one can easily obtain several dozen within an hour. At such occasions they fly about the twigs of the food-trees and the undergrowth beneath them; they are very partial to flowering privet.\nIt is rare in Great Britain and restricted to a number of sites in the south and east Midlands, between Oxford and Peterborough. The largest breeding colony is in Ham Home-cum-Hamgreen Woods in Buckinghamshire. Historically there have been around 90 known colonies since its discovery in 1828 but there have been many, mostly unsuccessful, introductions at various locations in southern England including one in Surrey in 1952 that seemed to be successful until the habitat was destroyed. It is now one of the rarest butterflies in Great Britain.\n\nIn June 2018, it was announced that a large population had been discovered in East Sussex, and it was observed in Oxfordshire at a site where it had not been seen since 1988.\n\nIt is found in most countries of continental Europe, except Mediterranean coastal regions. While widespread, the species is local and habitat-dependent. It is declining in the east of the region.\n\nThe black hairstreak is found in the south of Finland and Sweden, and extinct in Denmark.\n\n\"Note that information on this species applies to Great Britain and some details may not be consistent with the species in other parts of its range.\"\n\nThis small brown butterfly is very similar to the white-letter hairstreak but the black hairstreak has a row of orange spots along the edge of the upper-side hindwing. In the female these spots also extend to the forewings. The undersides are similar to the white-letter but the white line tends to be straighter and the orange border extends onto the forewings. The most conclusive way to distinguish the two is by the row of black spots accompanying the orange band which the white-letter hairstreak never has. They spend most of their lives in the canopy or in dense scrub, feeding on honeydew, and very rarely come down to ground level.\n\nEggs are laid singly on young blackthorn \"Prunus spinosa\" growth and it is this stage which hibernates. Although blackthorn is the main foodplant, wild plum \"Prunus domestica\" and other \"Prunus\" spp are occasionally used. The caterpillar hatches the following spring, at the end of April, just before the buds open and feeds on the flower buds. Older larvae are green and well camouflaged against the leaves on which they feed. Pupation takes place on leaves or twigs in June and the pupae are patterned black and white to mimic a bird dropping, as a defence against being eaten. The adult butterflies of this single-brood (univoltic) species are on the wing from the end of June to mid July.\n\n\n"}

Putnam's Sons is an American book publisher based in New York City, New York. Since 1996, it has been an imprint of the Penguin Group.\n\nThe company began as Wiley & Putnam with the 1838 partnership between George Palmer Putnam and John Wiley, whose father had founded his own company in 1807.\n\nIn 1841, Putnam went to London where he set up a branch office, the first American company ever to do so. In 1848, he returned to New York, where he dissolved the partnership with John Wiley and established G. Putnam Broadway, publishing a variety of works including quality illustrated books. Wiley began John Wiley (later John Wiley and Sons), which is still an independent publisher to the present day.\nIn 1853, G. P. Putnam & Co. started \"Putnam’s Magazine\" with Charles Frederick Briggs as its editor.\n\nOn George Palmer Putnam's death in 1872, his sons George H., John and Irving inherited the business and the firm's name was changed to G. P. Putnam's Sons. Son George H. Putnam became president of the firm, a position he held for the next fifty-two years.\n\nIn 1874, the company established its own book printing and manufacturing office, set up by John Putnam and operating initially out of newly leased premises at 182 Fifth Avenue. This printing side of the business later became a separate division called the Knickerbocker Press, and was relocated in 1889 to the Knickerbocker Press Building, built specifically for the press in New Rochelle, New York.\n\nOn the death of George H. Putnam in 1930, the various Putnam heirs voted to merge the firm with Minton, Balch & Co., who became the majority stockholders. George Palmer Putnam's grandson, George P. Putnam (1887–1950), left the firm at that time. Melville Minton, the partner and sales manager of Minton Balch & Co., became acting president and majority stockholder of the firm until his death in 1956. In 1936, Putnam acquired the publisher Coward-McCann (later Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, after John Geoghegan its long-time chairman), and ran it as an imprint into the 1980s. Upon Melville Minton's death, his son Walter J. Minton took control of the company.\n\nIn 1965, G. P. Putnam's Sons acquired Berkley Books, a mass market paperback publishing house.\n\nMCA bought Putnam Publishing Group and Berkley Publishing Group in 1975. Phyllis E. Grann who was running Pocket Books for Simon & Schuster was brought on board in 1976 as editor-in-chief. Grann worked with MCA executive Stanley Newman on a financial model to make Putnam profitable. This model emphasized publishing key authors annually and took Putnam from $10 million in revenue to over $100 million by 1983. While keeping the list at 75 titles a year, Putnam focused on winners like Tom Clancy whose book \"Red Storm Rising\" sold nearly a million copies in 1986. Putnam along with other publishers in the 1980s moved to a heavy discount hardcover model to keep up with demand and sales through bookstore chains and price clubs. Phyllis Grann was promoted to CEO of Putnam in 1987 becoming the first woman to be CEO of a major publishing house. By 1993, the publisher was making $200 million in revenue.\n\nIn 1982, Putnam acquired the respected children's book publisher, Grosset & Dunlap from Filmways. Also in 1982, Putnam acquired the book publishing division of Playboy Enterprises, which included Seaview Books.\n\nIn the 1990s ownership of Putnam changed a number of times. MCA was bought by Matsushita Electric in 1990. Then the Seagram Company acquired 80% of MCA from Matsushita and then shortly thereafter Seagram changed the name of the company to Universal Studios, Inc. The new owners had no interest in publishing, but Phyllis Grann stepped in and was able to broker the deal for Putnam to be merged with Penguin Group in 1996, a division of British publishing conglomerate, Pearson PLC Putnam and the Penguin Group formed Penguin Putnam Inc. In 2001, Grann abruptly left after speculation over tensions with Pearson CEO Marjorie Scardino.\n\nIn 2013, Penguin merged with Bertelsmann's Random House, forming Penguin Random House.\n\n\n\n"}

He is commonly associated with his time in Denmark he served as Director of the Royal Danish Academy of Art (1754–71). His most noteworthy work is the equestrian statue \"Frederik V on Horseback\" at Amalienborg.\n\nHe was born in Valenciennes to François Marie Saly (1684–1776) and his wife Marie-Michelle Jardez (1690–1760).\nHe began his training as a sculptor at nine years of age under local master Antoine Gilles in Valenciennes from 1726-1727. In spite of his parents' meager income, he was sent to Paris in 1732 to train in the studio of the leading sculptor at Paris, Guillaume Coustou. At the same time he attended the school of the \"Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture\", winning medals in 1734, 1737 and 1738.\n\nWinning that last medal, first place in the \"Prix de Rome\" competition, gave him the right to study at the French Academy at Rome, at the time the single mainstream route to a successful official career as a sculptor in Paris. He first received his stipend in 1740, and he arrived in Rome on 13 October 1740. He stayed there for eight years between 1740–1748, and lived at the Academy. The goal here was that through the study of antiquities and the masters of the past, one would develop and refine one's artistic taste. More practically it meant making marble copies of Roman sculpture for the French king.\n\nIn 1742 he made a monumental portrait bust of Manuel Pinto de Fonseca, Grand Master of the Order of Malta. In 1744 he made a bust of a little girl which is one of the most reproduced sculptures from the 18th century.\nHe became one of the first French members of the \"Accademia degli Arcadi\" in Rome 1744, and of the Academy of Design at Florence, in 1748, and of the accademia di belli arti, Bologna.\n\nHe traveled back to his home via Naples, Florence and Bologna, and arrived back in Valenciennes in the beginning of March 1749. The works he had sent home had received such positive attention that his hometown commissioned a full standing portrait of King Louis XV from him. The marble statue was erected in 1752, and destroyed in 1792. A plaster bust of Louis XV was also made that same year. He went on to Paris, where he became a member of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1751 with his work \"Le Faune au chevreau\". He was assistant professor at the Académie 1751-1753. He exhibited at the Paris Salons, 1750-1751 and 1753.He created a plaster bust of Madame de Pompadour in 1752, and a statue of Amor for her the next year.\nIn 1752 Saly was commissioned to create a sculpture of King Frederick V of Denmark on horseback to be placed in the center of the courtyard of Amalienborg Palace. The equestrian statue was commissioned by Adam Gottlob Moltke, head of the Danish Asiatic Company, as a gift to the king. But while Moltke's company offered to finance the statue, it was the government, however, who chose the sculptor. Count Johan Hartvig Ernst Bernstorff wrote to the Danish Legation secretary to the French Court in Paris Justitsråd Joachim Wasserschlebe to find a suitable French sculptor.\nSculptor Edmé Bouchardon rejected the offer, but suggested Saly, who wanted a significant sum for the model and free housing in Copenhagen. The government concluded the contract with Saly in Spring 1752, but due to conflict with ongoing projects Saly did not arrive in Denmark until 8 October 1753, bringing with him his parents, his two sisters and at least one assistant, Journée, along with his family. Work began on the monument that same year.\n\nDuring the same period of time the Royal Danish Academy of Art (\"Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi\") was officially established with offices at Charlottenborg, on Frederik V's birthday, 31 March 1754. Saly gave the main speech at the event, a snub to the current Academy Director architect Nicolai Eigtved. Saly was made member of the Academy; was named professor, and received a residence at Charlottenborg. Several months later after Eigtved died suddenly on 7 July 1754, Saly was named Eigtved's successor; he served as Director of the Academy from 25 July 1754 to 15 July 1771, and he was given a lifelong yearly pension in 1760.\nSaly worked hard to improve the Danish Academy after the model of the French Academy. He sought to bring about these changes, all the while working on his model of the equestrian statue for the king, the primary artistic work associated with his many years in Denmark.\n\nSaly was also instrumental in bringing his friend from the French Academy and the years in Italy, fellow-countryman and architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin, to the attention of King Frederik V as the suitable choice to replace Nicolai Eigtved for the design and building of Frederik's Church (\"Frederikskirke\"), now known as The Marble Church (\"Marmorkirken\"), work on which had had begun in 1749. A contract to bring Jardin to Denmark was concluded on 12 October 1754, a few months after Eigtved's death, and Jardin took over Eigtved's professorship at the Academy.\n\nSaly showed the king the first sketch of the equestrian statue on 4 December 1754. The king approved a sketch for the whole monument in August 1755. Then Saly began a thorough study of horses from the king's stalls. This resulted in a little model, which he showed the king in November 1758. Casts of this model are found in both the collection of the Academy and the State Collection, now the Danish National Gallery. Saly also sculpted around this same time a life-size bust of the king, of which seven bronze casts were created, and a sculpture of Moltke, the head of the Asiatic Company, of which three bronze casts were created.\n\nSaly, after having set up an appropriate studio, carried out the work on the large model of the equestrian statue 1761-1763, and the plaster cast was presented to the Academy members on 3 February 1764. The king also saw this model. Preparations for the bronze casting took four more years, and Frenchman Pierre Gors did the casting on 2 March 1768. 1768 is officially considered the statue's completion date.\n\nJohan Martin Preisler made a large engraving of the equestrian statue 1768-1769 in commemoration of its completion, and The Danish Asiatic Company cast two medallions, one by Wulff and the other by Daniel Jensen Adzer.\n\nThe base for the statue, however, was first deliverable in 1770, and the unveiling of the equestrian statue finally took place in the courtyard at Amalienborg Palace on 1 August 1771, five years after the King's death in 1766. It commands the site still to this day, and has been restored 1997-1998.\n\nSaly held the post of Academy Director until 15 July 1771, two weeks before the equestrian statue's unveiling. He quit in protest over a new set of rules that gave increased influence to native-born Danes. This all occurred during the oppressive reign of Johann Friedrich Struensee,\n\nSaly was named Knight of the Order of St Michel in Paris, but was not allowed to bear the title while living in Denmark.\n\nSaly, although no longer Director of the Academy, kept the apartment at Charlottenborg, from 1771 to at least 1774. During this time he tried to justify an additional sum from the Danish Asiatic Company for his extraordinary services on the monument to Frederik V, considering how much longer the statue took to complete than originally planned. He was not satisfied with the conclusion of his financial negotiations.\n\nHe left for Paris along with his father on 2 July 1774; most of the other family members had died by this point. One of his two sisters had married a French sea officer in Danish service. Back in Paris in 1775 he could now bear the title of Knight. He was named Senior Professor at the French Academy in Paris 29 July 1775. Already seriously ill when he left Denmark, he died on 4 May 1776. He was buried at Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois.\n\nHis artistic achievements are overshadowed by the monumental effort to create the equestrian statue of Frederik V of Denmark under the king's absolute rule. Saly's leading role at the Danish Academy of Art, during its early years helped establish the Academy as a force in art training not only in Scandinavia, but in Europe, and led the way to an emerging and strong Danish artist tradition.\n\nIn addition to the other Academy memberships already mentioned, Saly was also member of the academies in Marseilles (1762) and St. Petersburg (1768).\n\nHis sculptures are in the collections of the National Gallery of Denmark (Copenhagen), National Gallery of Art (Washington D.C.), Musée du Louvre (Paris), Musée des Beaux-Arts (Valenciennes, France) J. Paul Getty Museum (Los Angeles, California), as well as in private collections.\n\n\n\n"}

He first started playing guitar as a teenager in the late 1970s. With brother Hamish he formed The Clean, a group that went on to become one of the most popular and most respected bands in New Zealand.\n\nBorn in Ranfurly, Kilgour is the son of McGregor Kilgour and Helen Stewart Kilgour (née Auld). He was educated at Otago Boys' High School from 1974 to 1976.\n\nThe Clean are recognised as one of the founders of the New Zealand independent rock scene and a pivotal band in the development of the Dunedin sound, which was centred on the Flying Nun record label and produced other acts including The Verlaines, The Chills, Straitjacket Fits, The Bats (which included The Clean bassist Robert Scott) and the Tall Dwarfs. The Clean broke up in the early 1980s, and David Kilgour proceeded to form and play with other bands such as \"Stephen\" and The Great Unwashed. The Clean reformed in 1989 and produced the album \"Vehicle\".\n\nIn 1991, Kilgour struck out on his own and recorded his first solo CD, \"Here Come The Cars\", which received much critical acclaim. 1994 showcased the release of his second solo lp, \"Sugar Mouth\". In 1995 he released \"First Steps and False Alarms\", a compilation of recordings & demos, so called the 'best of the worst',done between the late 80s and early 90s. In 1997 he recorded his 3rd lp \"David Kilgour and The Heavy Eights\", made with the help of several other notable Dunedinites such as Martin Phillipps from The Chills. In late 2000, after a four-year hiatus, The Clean reformed again to record \"Getaway\", only their fourth full-length LP—along with \"Vehicle\", \"Modern Rock\" (1994) and \"Unknown Country\" (1996)—in their 20+ year history.\n\nKilgour has come to be known as one of the most respected and admired songwriters of his generation and certainly one of the greatest rock musicians to come out of New Zealand. His signature guitar twang and languid, carefree melodies are readily identifiable. His more obvious influences include Bob Dylan and Lou Reed, with other, less obvious influences including Brian Eno, to whom an instrumental on \"First Steps and False Alarms\" is dedicated.\n\nIn the 2001 New Year Honours, Kilgour was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to music. That same year, he released his 4th solo LP, \"A Feather In The Engine\", hailed by many as his best work yet. His current U.S. label, Merge, describes it as \"pure psychedelic pop bliss\".\n\nIn 2004, his fifth solo album \"Frozen Orange\" was released on Arch Hill Recordings (NZ) and Merge Records (USA). For \"Frozen Orange\", Kilgour left his native New Zealand and recorded in Nashville with members of Lambchop and Jason Loewenstein of Sebadoh, along with his longtime backing band The Heavy Eights, consisting of Taane Tokona, Alan Haig, Tony De Raad and Thomas Bell. The album also marked the first recording that Kilgour did not produce himself, a task left to Mark Nevers (producer / engineer of Lambchop).\n\nKilgour released his sixth solo album, \"The Far Now\", on 5 February 2007 on Arch Hill/Remote Control (NZ/Australia) and Merge (USA). The new album was recorded in Kilgour's hometown of Dunedin with his backing band The Heavy Eights. Recording of the album was split into two parts, with some songs laid down in winter 2004 at the Tinshed, and the rest between 2005 and 2006 at Studio One.\n\n\n\n\nSee The Clean discography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The UDMA reflected the change in Abbas' point of view. He considered that after the failure of the implementation of significant reform, the assimilation of the Algerian people into France as French citizens was no longer a viable alternative. He then advocated an autonomous state within the French framework; no longer would Algeria be considered a province of France; rather it would be an autonomous state within the French federalist system. UDMA won the elections to the Constituent Assembly in June 1946, by gaining 11 of the 13 seats devoted to the colonized population of Algeria.\nAfter 1948, fraud in the elections prevented nationalist parties from any significant success in the elections. Nevertheless, the UDMA took part in the electoral campaign. After the creation of the FLN (National Liberation Front) and the beginning of the War for Independence, negotiations took place to discuss the UDMA's merging with the FLN. In the end, it was decided that the UDMA, like the Algerian Communist Party, would dissolve and that its members would individually join the FLN. Ferhat Abbas and Ahmed Francis, two of the most prominent party leaders, fled to Cairo and joined the FLN leadership.\n\n"}

{"id": "2193171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193171", "title": "TrustRank", "text": "TrustRank\n\nTrustRank is an algorithm that conducts link analysis to separate useful webpages from spam and helps search engine rank pages in SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages). It is semi-automated process which means that it needs some human assistance in order to function properly. Search engines have many different algorithms and ranking factors that they use when measuring the quality of webpages. TrustRank is one of them. \n\nBecause manual review of the Internet is impractical and very expensive, TrustRank was introduced in order to help achieve this task much faster and cheaper. It was first introduced by researchers Zoltan Gyongyi and Hector Garcia-Molina of Stanford University and Jan Pedersen of Yahoo! in their paper \"Combating Web Spam with TrustRank\" in 2004. Today, this algorithm is a part of major web search engines like Yahoo! and Google. \n\nOne of the most important factors that help web search engine determine the quality of a web page when returning results are backlinks. Search engines take a number and quality of backlinks into consideration when assigning a place to a certain web page in SERPs. Many web spam pages are created only with the intention of misleading search engines. These pages, chiefly created for commercial reasons, use various techniques to achieve higher-than-deserved rankings in the search engines' result pages. While human experts can easily identify spam, search engines are still being improved daily in order to do it without help of humans. \n\nOne popular method for improving rankings is to increase the perceived importance of a document through complex linking schemes. Google's PageRank and other search ranking algorithms have been subjected to such manipulation.\n\nTrustRank seeks to combat spam by filtering the web based upon reliability. The method calls for selecting a small set of seed pages to be evaluated by an expert. Once the reputable seed pages are manually identified, a crawl extending outward from the seed set seeks out similarly reliable and trustworthy pages. TrustRank's reliability diminishes with increased distance between documents and the seed set. \n\nThe logic works in the opposite way as well, which is called Anti-Trust Rank. The closer a site is to spam resources, the more likely it is to be spam as well.\n\nThe researchers who proposed the TrustRank methodology have continued to refine their work by evaluating related topics, such as measuring spam mass.\n\n\n"}

Formed in Sweden on 10 June 1978, the party was led by former leading SWAPO members Andreas Shipanga (President), Kenneth Abrahams, Ottilie Abrahams (Secretary-General), and Emil Appolus in response to a major party split within SWAPO which resulted in the forced detention of Shipanga and Solomon Mfifma during the 1975-76 SWAPO crisis, also known as the \"Shipanga Rebellion\".\n\nSWAPO-D were generally seen by SWAPO as traitors and collaborators with the apartheid regime. However, they were still following a comparable political course, boycotting the 1975–1977 Turnhalle Constitutional Conference and the resulting 1978 legislative elections.
