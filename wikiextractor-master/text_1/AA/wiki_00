In liturgical Christian churches, this feast of St. Mark is observed on 25 April of each year; thus St. Mark's Eve is 24 April.\n\nIt was the custom in villages in England, from the 17th century to the late 19th century, to sit in the church porch on St. Mark's Eve. Those sitting had to keep silent between the bell tolling at 11.00 p.m. until the bell struck 1.00 a.m. In Yorkshire it was necessary to keep vigil for three successive nights. On the third such sitting, it was said that the ghosts of those to die during the year would be witnessed passing into the church. This practice took place throughout England, but was most prevalent in northern and western counties.\n\nSome accounts of the custom state that the watchers must be fasting, or must circle the church before taking up position. The ghosts of those who were to die soon would be the first observed, while those who would almost see out the year would not be witnessed until almost 1.00 a.m. Other variations of the superstition say that the watchers would see headless or rotting corpses, or coffins approaching. Another tradition holds that a young woman can see the face of her future husband appear on her smock by holding it before the fire on St Mark's Eve.\n\n\n"}

The mountain is located in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness of White River National Forest, north by northeast (bearing 30°) of the community of Redstone in Pitkin County, Colorado, United States.\n\nMount Sopris is located in western Pitkin County, south of Carbondale and southwest of the confluence of the Crystal and Roaring Fork rivers. Mount Sopris is notable for having two summits, East Sopris and West Sopris, that are one-half mile (0.8 km) apart and have the same elevation of .\n\nIt is named for Richard Sopris, a former mayor of Denver and part of the first European expedition in the Roaring Fork Valley. In 2011 J.P. McDaniels petitioned to rename East Sopris \"Mount John Denver\" after the Colorado singer. A local poll in Aspen and Carbondale said 74 percent of the respondents were against the proposal.\n\nMount Sopris is believed to have been formed by an igneous intrusion 10,000 feet below the earth's surface, geologically referred to as a pluton, that occurred around 30 million years ago, after the initial uplift of the modern Rocky Mountains. Mount Sopris is not a volcano, but it is possible that an ancient volcano sat above it, with the current rock forming the magma chamber far below. Due to subsequent continued erosion, any evidence is now gone. In either case, the rock that makes up Sopris never reached the surface, cooling and crystallizing in situ, and later becoming exposed due to erosion. Nearby prominent peaks Mount Gunnison and Crested Butte are believed to have formed similarly. \n\nMount Sopris dominates the skyline of Carbondale and the lower Roaring Fork Valley, serving as an unofficial symbol of the area. It is prominently visible from State Highway 82 in the vicinity of Carbondale. In terms of local relief, it is one of the largest peaks in the state of Colorado. For example, West Sopris rises 6,400 ft (1,905 m) above the valley to the west in only 2.7 mi (4 km). (One can compare this to the corresponding vertical rise of the more well-known Maroon Peak in the heart of the Elks: it rises only about 4,300 ft (1,310 m), at best, in the same horizontal distance.) In fact a vertical rise of over 6,000 feet in less than 3 miles is rare and impressive anywhere in the contiguous United States.\n\nThe Mount Sopris Trail ascends to East Sopris via its east ridge. It starts near Dinkle Lake, on the northeast side of the mountain, and passes between the two Thomas Lakes just before reaching timberline. The ascent involves about 4,300 ft (1,300 m) of vertical gain (plus 600 ft/180 m for a round-trip to West Sopris, if desired) and 12 mi (20 km) of hiking (plus 1 mi/1.6 km for West Sopris); it is a strenuous trail hike, with some scree.\n\n\n"}

He is the father of political author Anthony Seldon.\n\nArthur Seldon was born Abraham Margolis in the East End of London to Masha and Pinhas Margolis. They came to Britain from Kiev fleeing the anti-semitic pogroms in 1903 or 1904. Abraham was probably born at Mrs Levy's Maternity Home, Petticoat Lane, near Aldgate, London. Masha and Pinchas Margolis were married in Kiev; he was probably born at Perioslav, a village near Kiev. The family were very poor: Pinchas worked making caps at a Jewish immigrant's factory called Goldstein & Co, Commercial Road, Stepney and, they lived at 12 Marks Street, Aldgate. It was not until after they moved to 13 Beeford Street, Stepney that Abraham was actually born. His oldest brother Jack was born in 1906, and a sister Bess in 1910; brothers Susman and Solly Margolis changed their names to Cecil Margolis and Sidney Margolis respectively; only Abraham changed his whole name. His mother Masha had two brothers Ben and Morris Kopelolt who had also come to London as refugees. When his parents both died in the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, his uncles families took the boys in, and then sent them away to school. Abraham was put up for adoption by a cobbler, Pinchas Slaberdain, and his wife Eva at 154 Oxford Street, Commercial Road, Stepney. Arthur Seldon never forgot where he came from, and the intense poverty that had shaped his family's arrival in this country. But rather than turning for help to socialism he worked hard, first at school, and then to get a tertiary education becoming self-reliant.\n\nAged only eight he remembered cheering on the Labour candidate for Stepney in the 1924 General election campaign. Abraham was educated at elementary school Sir Henry Raine's Grammar School. There in 1928 he was impressed by History master E J Hayward's interpretation of cottage industry's transition to capitalism. A scholarship paid for the London School of Economics where he read Friedrich Hayek, Arnold Plant and Lionel Robbins served to deepen his interest in classical liberalism. Friedrich Hayek's \"Road to Serfdom\" introduced him to Austrian economics. Seldon helped found the small university's student Liberal Society. Nonetheless he retained anti-fascist principles as war drew nearer.\n\nHe served with the army in North Africa and Italy during the war. Arthur married Marjorie in 1948, and continued to be involved with the Liberal Party. He was chairman of its committee on the elderly from 1948 to 1949.\n\nSeldon was working at the Brewer's Society in 1956 when approached by Lord Grantchester to be asked if he wanted to join a new 'Think Tank' just set up by Antony Fisher on the advice of Friedrich Hayek, founder of the Chicago School of economics and champion of free market neoliberalism. Seldon wrote a first pamphlet still only 20 years of age, called \"The Intellectuals and Socialism\" (1937) in which he criticised the keynesian state and its bureaucracy as \"second hand dealers in ideas.\" Ralph Harris was appointed General Director of the new Institute of Economic Affairs and Arthur was Editorial Adviser. Antony, later Lord Fisher left a legacy of think tanks that he had founded all around the world. \"The State Versus Market\" pamphlet was published when he was still only twenty years old, based on a book review, it explained the benefits of market competition.\n\nSeldon joined the Liberal Party. He was on a Committee of Enquiry chaired by Elliott Dodds into the distribution of property, exploring the idea of \"ownership for all,\" and the effects of statist maldistribution. In \"The Drift to Corporate State\" he severely criticised the corporatist industrial policy being against state monopoly. It was an idea endorsed by the Liberal Assembly ten years earlier in 1948. In another pamphlet in 1957, the IEA published \"Pensions in a Free Society\" commented freely on the Liberal Beveridge Report of 1942 into founding of the state pension system. Seldon generated editorial copy: edited recruited authors, made available titles to a wider audience. Pamphlets were of between 10,000 and 15,000 words and as such represented a new form of political literature. It was also Seldon's inspiration to produce series, such as Hobart Papers, Occasional Papers, and Readings etc.\n\nSeldon was also involved in the famous Orpington by-election in 1962, in which the Liberal Party gained the seat from the Conservative Party and weakened the confidence of the Macmillan administration. A neoliberal free marketeer, he influenced the policies of Margaret Thatcher.\n\nIn 1970 Seldon invited Milton Friedman at the IEA, quick to recognise the value of monetarist policy. The ideas imported from Chicago had a great influence on members of the Conservative party, especially Enoch Powell, Sir Keith Joseph, and Margaret Thatcher. Public Choice Theory analysed the relations between the State and voluntary activity. He organised a conference in 1978 called \"Economics in Britain\" – the American economist James Buchanan, founder of Public Choice was invited. In 1980 Seldon founded the IEA's \"Economic Journal\". Seldon gained a reputation as an exceptionally competent editor. He would, according to Ralph Harris, re-write poor pamphlets to such an extent as to almost become its co-author. In \"Vote Motive\" he found a voice that was most profound and influential, shaping the post-modern ethos for electioneering and party politics.\n\nSeldon won the Fisher Arts Literary Prize in 1991, although it was established by the founder of IEA, so nobody minded the eternal paradox, for his book \"Capitalism\". He received an honorary degree in 1999 from the University of Buckingham.\n\nArthur Seldon is the father of the historian Anthony Seldon.\n\nSeldon's widow Marjorie was interviewed about his work at the IEA and the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series \"Tory! Tory! Tory!\".\n\nAll publications from 1956 with the IEA unless otherwise stated:\n\n\n"}

Their product lines include electric and acoustic guitars, basses, guitar and bass amplifiers, effects units, USB audio interfaces and guitar/bass wireless systems. The company was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in Calabasas, California.\n\nLine 6 imports its products primarily from China. Since December 2013, it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the Yamaha Corporation.\n\nMarcus Ryle and Michel Doidic (two former Oberheim designers) co-founded Fast-Forward Designs, where they helped develop several notable pro audio products such as the Alesis ADAT, Quadraverbs and QuadraSynth, and Digidesign SampleCell. As digital signal processing became more and more powerful and affordable during the 1980s, they began developing DSP-based products for guitarists. As Ryle tells the story, the name \"Line 6\" came about because the phone system at Fast-Forward Designs only had 5 lines. Because the new guitar-related products were developed in secrecy, the receptionist used \"Line 6\" as a code word of sorts, and paging them for a call on Line 6 meant to stop any guitar or amp-related sounds so that they wouldn't be overheard by other Fast-Forward clients or callers.\n\nLine 6 launched in 1996, with their first digital-modeling guitar amplifier, the AxSys 212, a combo amp using one 2x12\" speaker. This was followed in 1997 by the Flextone. The company underwent a rapid expansion in the early 2000s (decade) due to the success of their \"Pod\" product line, which isolated modeling circuitry from the AxSys amplifier.\n\nDigital modeling attempts to recreate the unique characteristics of musical instruments and pro audio gear. Early Line 6 products used digital modeling to emulate the signature tone of a guitar amp/speaker combination. Further development of Line 6's modeling technology has extended the emulation to include numerous guitar amplifier / guitar cabinet combinations, guitar effects, microphones, and even different guitars and other fretted instruments themselves. Digital modeling offers countless virtual combinations of a variety of music gear, but only as emulations, however convincing as they may be.\n\nThough Line 6 began with a modeling guitar amp, their breakthrough product line was arguably the POD guitar processor line and its later variants, but this modeling technology has been the foundation for most of Line 6's products, from guitar amps to software and computer audio interfaces. Line 6 has an active user community, and provides software that allows users to easily download and share patches or device settings for many of Line 6's products.\n\nIn early 2008, Line 6 acquired X2 Digital Wireless, who had introduced digital wireless systems for guitar. Further developing this technology, Line 6 developed and introduced a family of digital wireless microphone systems in 2010.\n\nIn December 2013, it was confirmed that Line 6 was to be bought by Yamaha Corporation, to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary with the internal management remaining the same.\n\nLine 6 produces a number of guitar amplifiers (combos and heads), all featuring amplifier modeling software. In 2004, the Spider II 112 combo amp was released. The Spider III sold over 12,700 units in 2011, the 15-watt Spider IV amp was the best-selling guitar amplifier in America. As of this time, they've launched the Spider IV, which has also been the best-selling 15, 30, 75, and 120 watt amp, according to their website.\n\nPedal boards range from Pod amp modelers to modeling pedals for delay and other effects, as well as a jam looper. In 2015 Line 6 announced their 'next generation' multi-effects processor/ pedalboard named Helix, similar in function to the Floor Pod and Pod Live series, but with a redesigned interface and body.\n\nThe BackTrack and BackTrack+Mic are portable recording devices for electric and acoustic guitars, respectively.\n\nThe earlier audio interface produced by Line 6, GuitarPort, is replaced by the TonePort line.

Mee was also a manager, noted for leading Arsenal to their first Double win in 1971.\n\nBorn in Bulwell, Nottingham, Mee played for Derby County and Mansfield Town. In 1940–41, Mee made 16 guest appearances for Southampton, scoring twice.\n\nAfter his playing career was cut short by injury, Mee joined the Royal Army Medical Corps where he trained as a physiotherapist and spent six years, rising to the rank of sergeant. After leaving, he worked for various football clubs as a physiotherapist before joining Arsenal in 1960, succeeding Billy Milne.\n\nAfter the sacking of Billy Wright in 1966, the club asked Mee to become manager, a highly surprising move, perhaps even to the man himself; Mee asked for a get-out clause for him to return to physiotherapist after twelve months if it didn't work out. Mee recruited Dave Sexton and Don Howe as his assistants, in order to make up for any tactical shortcomings of his own.\n\nArsenal hadn't won a trophy since 1953, but, under Mee, with a crop of players from Arsenal's youth system, such as Charlie George, John Radford, Pat Rice and Ray Kennedy, began to show promise. Arsenal reached two successive League Cup finals in 1968 and 1969, but lost them both to Leeds United and Swindon Town respectively. However, the following season, the club won its first European trophy and its first trophy of any kind for 17 years, beating Anderlecht to claim the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, 4–3 on aggregate. After being 3-0 down in the away leg, Arsenal grabbed a late consolation and then beat the Belgian side 3–0 at Highbury.\n\nThe Fairs Cup was only the warm-up for the main act, namely the FA Cup and League Double win in 1971. The League title was won at White Hart Lane, home of their deadly rivals Tottenham Hotspur, on Monday 3 May, the last day of the season; five days later Arsenal beat Liverpool 2–1 at Wembley after extra-time, the winning goal scored by Charlie George. It was only the second time a club had won a Double in the twentieth century.\n\nArsenal had ambitions to retain their title the following season and signed Alan Ball from Everton. However their league campaign faltered and their hopes of a trophy depended on the FA Cup, where Arsenal had again reached the final, this time facing Leeds. Arsenal lost by a single goal. In the 1972–73 season Arsenal managed a serious championship challenge, at one point topping the table, but eventually finished runners-up. A run in the FA Cup was brought to an end by a semi final defeat to eventual winners Sunderland.\n\nMee then began to break up the team which had won the double, and players such as Ray Kennedy, Charlie George and captain Frank McLintock departed. Mee announced his resignation in 1976 as Arsenal's most successful manager in terms of victories with 241 wins, a number that would not be surpassed until 2006 by Arsène Wenger. Mee was succeeded by Terry Neill.\n\nHe would later join Watford as assistant to Graham Taylor in 1978 in charge of scouting, and later became a director of the Hornets before retiring in 1991.\n\nMee was made an OBE in 1984 for services to football.

His Ultramontanism spearheaded the Romanisation of the Catholic Church in Ireland and ushered in the devotional revolution experienced in Ireland through the second half of the 19th century and much of the 20th century. A trained biblical theologian and scholar of ancient languages, Cullen crafted the formula for papal infallibility at the First Vatican Council.\n\nCullen was born at Prospect, Narraghmore, Athy, County Kildare, one of 16 children of Hugh and Judith Maher Cullen, six of whom were from Hugh's first marriage. His first school was the Quaker Shackleton School in nearby Ballitore. Following the relaxation of some of the Penal Laws, his father purchased some , giving him the status of a Catholic \"strong farmer\", a class that greatly influenced 19th-century Irish society. They were fervent in their Catholicism and fearful of the sort of social unrest that had led to the failed 1798 Rising.\n\nCullen entered St. Patrick's, Carlow College, in 1816, and, in 1820, he proceeded to the Pontifical Urban College in Rome, where his name is registered on the roll of students of 29 November 1820. At the close of a distinguished course of studies, he was selected to hold a public disputation in the halls of the Propaganda on 11 September 1828, in 224 theses from all theology and ecclesiastical history. The theological tournament was privileged in many ways, for Pope Leo XII, attended by his court, presided on the occasion, while no fewer than ten cardinals assisted at it, together with all the élite of ecclesiastical Rome. Vincenzo Pecci, the future Pope Leo XIII, was present at the disputation. Cullen graduated a doctor of divinity.\n\nHe was ordained in 1829. During his studies, Cullen acquired knowledge of classical and Oriental languages. He was later appointed to the chairs of Hebrew and Sacred Scripture in the schools of the Propaganda, and receiving at the same time the charge of the famed printing establishment of the Congregation of \"Propaganda Fidei\". This later charge he resigned in 1832, after being appointed Rector of the Pontifical Irish College in Rome, but during the short term of his administration, he published a standard edition of the Greek and Latin Lexicon of Benjamin Hedericus, which still holds its place in the Italian colleges; he also edited the Acts of the congregation in seven quarto volumes, as well as other important works.\n\nIn late 1831, Cullen was appointed rector of a fledgling and struggling Irish College. He successfully secured the future of the college by increasing the student population and thereby strengthening the finances of the college. He astutely fostered relationships with the Irish hierarchy, on whom he relied for students, often becoming their official Roman agent. This role yielded income and influence and was to remain a key function of future rectors. He endeavoured to chart a middle ground between conflicting parties of Irish bishops. He was active in his opposition to the establishment of the secular Queen's Colleges.\n\nDuring the revolution that marked the demise of the Papal States and the beginning of the Roman Republic, he accepted the position of rector of the College of Propaganda while retaining charge of the Irish College. As all the rectors of Colleges in Rome, who were not foreigners, had to leave the city, Cullen was left in charge, temporally, of their interests. Soon after his appointment the Revolutionary Trimuvirate issued orders that the College of Propaganda was to be dissolved and the buildings appropriated. The rector appealed to Lewis Cass, a United States Charge de Affairs at Rome, for the protection of the citizens of the United States who were students of the college. Within an hour, the American flag was floating over the Propaganda College. The order of confiscation was withdrawn. Cass was subsequently criticized for his actions by American anti-Catholic interests.\n\nCullen was appointed Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh on 19 December 1849 and consecrated by the Cardinal Prefect of Propaganda at the Irish College in Rome on 24 February 1850. He was also named Apostolic Delegate. His first major act as Archbishop of Armagh was to convene the Synod of Thurles (1850), the first Roman Catholic national synod held in Ireland since the Reformation. It occurred during the period of the debilitating Irish Famine which reduced the population of the country by over 2 million people through starvation, disease and emigration. The purpose of the synod was to establish a new ecclesiastical discipline in Ireland. This included rules relating to the celebration of Mass, the administration of the sacraments and the maintenance of registers and archives.\n\nCullen was transferred to the See of Dublin on 1 May 1852 and 14 years later, in 1866, was elevated to the cardinalate as Cardinal-Priest of \"San Pietro in Montorio\" the first Irish cardinal.\n\nCullen was sent to Ireland to bring the Irish church into conformity with Roman canon law and usage and to that end he recruited new clergy and orders of religious brother and sisters. After a series of disastrous harvest in the 1860s, he founded, with the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the Mansion House Relief Committee in 1862. Cullen also started the practice of Irish priests wearing Roman collars and being called \"Father\" (instead of \"Mister\") by their parishioners.\n\nCullen was particularly intent on promoting Roman Catholic religious education in Ireland. From the first days of his episcopate Cullen had planned and pursued a Roman Catholic university for Ireland. The university project was welcomed generally by the Irish at home and abroad and the beginnings of the institution in Dublin gave some promise. In 1862 the cornerstone of the New University building was laid with Archbishop Hughes of New York preaching on the occasion. John Henry Newman, whom he had invited to be Rector of the Catholic University, complained that the Archbishop treated him and the laity not as equals but as his subjects.\n\nCullen paid frequent visits to Rome. He took part in the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1854 and with the 18th centenary of the martyrdom of Saints Peter and Paul in 1867, when he stayed at the Irish College. \n\nHe attended all the sessions of Vatican I, taking an active part in its deliberations. Towards the close of the council, at the express wish of the Central Commission, he proposed a formula for the definition of papal infallibility. It was a matter of great delicacy, as promoters of the definition were split in various factions, some anxious to assign a wide range to the pope's decisions, and others would set forth in a somewhat indefinite way the papal prerogative.\n\nIn 1864, he founded the \"Irish Ecclesiastical Record\".\n\nHe arrived late to the Conclave of 1878.\n\nHe was the most important Irish political figure in the 30 years between Daniel O'Connell and Charles Stuart Parnell. In political matters, Cullen made it a rule to support every measure, whatever its provenance, conducive to the interests of his vision for the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland. Desmond Bowen considers Cardinal Cullen \"a cautious, suspicious, and usually shrewd product of the Roman school of diplomacy\". He had a strong distrust of secret societies and waged a public campaign against the Young Irelanders and the Fenians. He supported redress by constitutional means. The Gladstone government disestablished the Church of Ireland during his episcopacy.\n\nCullen was a frequent visitor at the vice-regal lodge to lobby the government. In 1867, the Fenian leader General Thomas F. Burke had been sentenced to death, and efforts to obtain a reprieve had been in vain. He had fought with distinction in the American Civil War, and the British government was determined to deter other skilled military leaders from enlisting with revolutionaries. The orders of execution from London were peremptory. The scaffold was already erected, and the next morning Burke was to be hanged. Through mediation from Archbishop Hughes of New York and others, Cullen became convinced of the character of the accused and was able to obtain a grant of reprieve for Burke.\n\nHe died in Dublin and was buried at Holy Cross College in Drumcondra.\n\nCullen is most notable today for being the first Irish cardinal. With his experience and friendships in Rome he was able to influence the choice of appointments to episcopal sees in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada. His relatives, friends, and students, referred to as \"Cullenites\", exerted great influence overseas, with his nephew, Patrick Francis Moran, archbishop of Sydney, one notable example. The term also refers to a style of leadership resembling that of Cullen, characterized as \"authoritative\" and \"intransigent\".\n\nFather Thomas N. Burke, O.P., in a sermon at a solemn Requiem mass, the \"Month's Mind\" of 27 November 1878, said: \"The guiding spirit animating, encouraging and directing the wonderful work of the Irish Catholic Church for the last twenty eight years was Paul, Cardinal Cullen.\"\n\nCullen has been credited with the revival of regular Catholic devotion in Ireland. An extreme Ultramontanist, he vigorously opposed secret societies with revolutionary aims, as well as the system of mixed education then in force. His opposition was largely responsible for the failure of Gladstone's Irish Universities Bill in 1873. \n\nIn James Joyce's \"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\", the protagonist's father mentions Cullen: \"Mr Dedalus uttered a guffaw of coarse scorn. O, by God, he cried, I forgot little old Paul Cullen! Another apple of God's eye!\"\n\nAlthough a devout Catholic herself, Mary Jane, wife of Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, wrote a blistering response in her poem, \"\"Tis for the Glory of the Faith\"\", to what she saw as Cullen's suggestion that Irish emigrants had the role of spreading Catholicism abroad.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the older son of the village minister Hans Egede and his wife Gertrud Rask. Hans became dedicated to the cause of restoring contact with and missionizing among the Norsemen of the lost Greenland colony, who were presumed to have remained Catholic following the Reformation. He parlayed support among Norwegian merchants and the Danish Mission College into the establishment of the Bergen Greenland Company, which equipped three ships which left Bergen in 1721. A few months later, the Egede family and about forty other colonists landed on the Island of Hope (modern Kangeq) at the mouth of the fjord which houses today's Nuuk. Scurvy broke out and most returned home as quickly as possible, but the natives proved generally curious and helpful. No Norse survivors were found and Hans's company went bankrupt in 1727, but he and his family learned the local Inuit dialect and began a Christian mission among them.\n\nPaul assisted his father in his work and, when his mother died and Hans returned to bury her in Denmark after a smallpox outbreak, he took over the mission for an additional six years, accepting to forgo his own desire to become a Danish naval officer. He succeeded his father as superintendent of the Greenland mission. The Lutheran mission was not as successful as the Moravian missions in Greenland, but the expansion of colonies and trading outposts under Jacob Severin's company and the General Trade Company was always eventually followed by a chapel or church at the site. Egede was also an accomplished botanist.\n\nIn 1742, Egede was appointed Minister of the Vartov Lutheran Church in Copenhagen. In 1747, he became a professor of theology at the Greenland Mission Seminary established in Denmark by his father and then, in 1758, its provost. In 1779, he was elevated to Bishop of Greenland and, in 1785, made a fellow of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters.\n\nEgede and a kalaaleq woman named Arnarsaq translated the New Testament into Kalaallisut, the language of the West Greenland Inuit. He went on to publish a Kalaallisut–Danish–Latin dictionary (1750), a revised Kalaallisut catechism (1756), and a Kalaallisut grammar (1760), as well as a number of other books concerning the language.\n\nPaul Egede died in Copenhagen in 1789, having published in that year his journal of his life in Greenland.\n\n\n"}

He was the founder of the Monastery of the Mother of God Petritzonitissa in Bachkovo and author of its \"typikon\". The monks of this Orthodox monastery were Iberians.\n\nGregory's origins are a matter for scholarly dispute. He is believed to have hailed from the region of Tao or Tayk, which had been ruled by Georgian Bagratids of kouropalatate of Iberia, later annexed by the Byzantines to the theme of Iberia in 1001. According to the contemporary historian Anna Comnena, who knew Pakourianos personally, Gregory was \"descended from a noble Armenian family,\" while the Armenian chronicler Matthew of Edessa, from the 12th century, notes that he was of Georgian (Vrats) origin had in mind Pakourianos' religious affiliation. Gregory himself proclaimed that he belonged to \"the glorious people of the Iberians\" and insisted his monks to know the Georgian language. In her study on Byzantine administration over the provinces of Armenia, Armenian historian Viada Arutjunova-Fidanjan believes that Pakourianos was born into a Chalcedonian Armenian family.\n\nTaking into account all the evidence available on Pakourianos, the scholar Nina G. Garsoïan proposed that \"the most likely explanation is that [the Pakourian family] belonged to the mixed Armeno-Iberian Chalcedonian aristocracy, which dwelt in the border district of Tayk/Tao.\"\n\nAccording to Anna Comnena, Pakourianos was tiny of body but a mighty warrior.\n\nSince 1060 Gregory served in Byzantine army. In 1064 he had achieved a significant position among the Byzantine military aristocracy, but failed at defending Ani against the Seljuk leader Alp Arslan, King Bagrat IV of Georgia and Albanian King Goridzhan in the same year. Since 1071 he was appointed as a \"Strategos\" (governor) of the theme of Iberia. As the Seljuk advance forced the Byzantines to evacuate the eastern Anatolian fortresses and the theme of Iberia, Gregory ceded control over Kars and Tao to King George II of Georgia in 1074. This did not help, however, to stem the Turkish advance and the area became a battleground of the Georgian-Seljuk wars.\n\nAfterwards he served under Michael VII Doukas (1071–78) and Nikephoros III Botaneiates (1078–81) in various responsible positions on both the eastern and the western frontiers of the empire. Later Gregory was involved in a coup that removed Nikephoros III. The new Emperor, Alexios I Komnenos, appointed him \"\"megas domestikos\" of All the West\" and gave him many more properties in the Balkans. He possessed numerous estates in various parts of the Byzantine Empire and was afforded a variety of privileges by the emperor, including exemption from certain taxes. In 1081, he commanded the left flank against the Normans at the Battle of Dyrrachium. A year later he evicted the Normans from Moglena. He died in 1086 fighting the Pechenegs at the battle of Beliatoba, charging so vigorously he crashed into a tree.\n\nGregory was also known as a noted patron and promoter of Christian culture. He together with his brother Abas (Apasios) made, in 1074, a significant donation to the Eastern Orthodox Holy Monastery of Iviron on Mount Athos and commissioned the regulations (\"typikon\") for this foundation. He signed the Greek version of the Typikon in Armenian. He also signed his name in Georgian and Armenian characters rather than Greek. It is assumed that Pakourianos did not know Greek.\n\nGregory Pakourianos and his brother Abas were buried in a bone-vault house near the Bachkovo Monastery. The portraits of the two brothers are painted on the north wall of the bone-vault house.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1791128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791128", "title": "Mexican labor law", "text": "Mexican labor law\n\nMexican labor law governs the process by which workers in Mexico may organize labor unions, engage in collective bargaining, and strike. Current labor law reflects the historic interrelation between the state and the Confederation of Mexican Workers, the labor confederation officially aligned with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI), which ruled Mexico under various names for more than seventy years. \n\nWhile the law, on its face, promises workers the right to strike and to organize, in practice it makes it difficult or impossible for independent unions to organize while condoning the corrupt practices of many existing unions and the employers with which they deal.\n\nThe current system originated in the Mexican Revolution of 1910–1920, which produced the Constitution of 1917. Article 123 of that Constitution gave workers the right to organize labor unions and to strike. It also provided protection for women and children, the eight-hour day, and a living wage. \n\nThe Constitution's promised rights, however, remained mere promises until 1931, when the government enacted the Ley Federal de Trabajo or Federal Labor Law. The LFT established Juntas de Conciliación y Arbitraje (the Boards of Conciliation and Arbitration), made up of representatives of the government, employers and labor unions.\n\nIn order to participate in this system, a union must have a legal registration (registro), must have an officially recognized right to negotiate collective bargaining agreements (titularidad), and must periodically re-register its officers and be accepted by the state (toma de nota). This system can be used to hobble independent unions not associated with the CTM or other federations that have established relations with the state, since all three members of these boards often have self-interested reasons for denying or delaying registration to rival unions.\n\nEmployers can also avoid unionization by entering into \"protection contracts\" with \"sindicatos blancos\" or \"white unions\", often before a plant is ever built. Such contracts frequently give the union a closed shop, which authorizes the union to demand that the employer fire a worker who is not a member in the union in good standing; that power can, in turn, be used to single out employees who seek to organize independent unions for termination. Some observers, including the independent Unión Nacional de Trabajadores (http://www.unt.org.mx) or UNT, estimate that between eighty and ninety percent of all collective bargaining agreements in Mexico fall into this category. \n\nEmployees are not always aware that they are covered by a protection contract or that they are represented by a union; while the ghost union may have registered with the Board and filed its contract with it, those records are not made public. An outside union that has filed a petition seeking to organize workers may have its petition dismissed if it is unaware that another union is already recognized or if it does not list the correct name or legal address of the incumbent union.\n\nIf an outside union challenging a recognized union is able to obtain registration, then it must go through an election to oust the incumbent. Local Boards often delay such elections for long periods; when they do take place they are by voice vote, rather than secret ballot, in elections held in the workplace under the supervision of a representative of the labour board, the employer, the official union and the independent union. In recent contested elections workers have been required to pass through a gauntlet of armed representatives of the incumbent union in order to report for work and to vote in their workplace. Even if the independent union wins the election, the original contract remains in place until its expiration. \n\nWhile Mexican labor law gives workers powerful rights to strike, barring employers from hiring replacement workers or operating during a strike, those rights are dependent on official approval from the Board. These local Boards frequently declare strikes to be \"inexistente\" or non-existent, depriving striking workers of all their legal protections. As a result, while labour protests and work stoppages are frequent in Mexico, legal strikes are rare.\n\nThe PRI and Mexican employers' associations started floating proposals to enhance productivity of Mexican industry by allowing it more \"flexibility\" during the late 1980s, when \"technocrats\" such as Miguel de la Madrid, Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Ernesto Zedillo were in command of the PRI. Those proposals made no headway, however, until after the election of Vicente Fox Quesada of the Partido Acción Nacional, or PAN, in 2000. Fox's Secretary of Labor, Carlos Abascal Carranza, a former head of one of the largest employer associations, initiated discussions in 2001 with employer associations and the official and independent union confederations aimed at achieving a consensus proposal for labor law reform.\n\nThe Abascal proposal presented in 2002, however, would tighten government control of unions and collective bargaining, without taking any steps to make information about unions' collective bargaining agreements or their activities available to affected workers or the public or make the organizing process any less cumbersome. On the contrary, the proposed reforms would heighten the risks for workers seeking to organize by requiring independent unions to submit the name and address of each of their members to the local Boards, which would then have the power to investigate the authenticity of their signatures. \n\nThe reforms would also favor existing unions by barring the board from considering more than one election petition at a time and tightening jurisdictional rules defining which labor organization can represent which workers, according to their craft, enterprise and company, making it impossible for some independent unions to challenge incumbents.\n\nOpponents of the law have challenged it under the provisions of the labor side letter to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). While the CTM originally supported the reforms, some unions within the official labor movement have expressed reservations about it. The proposals are currently at a standstill.\n\n\n"}

Atlas promotes think tanks that support private-property rights, limited government, the rule of law, and market economics. Atlas Network is not named after Ayn Rand's novel \"Atlas Shrugged\".\n\nAccording to journalist Lee Fang, writing for \"The Intercept\", the libertarian Atlas Network has \"reshaped political power in country after country,\" operating as an extension of U.S. foreign policy, with Atlas-affiliated think tanks receiving funding from the United States Department of State and the National Endowment for Democracy. The organization's methods include providing grants for new think tanks, providing courses on political management and public relations, sponsorship of networking events around the world, and encouraging libertarians to influence public opinion through social media and online videos.\n\nAtlas was founded in 1981 by Sir Antony Fisher. After founding the Institute of Economic Affairs in London in 1955, Fisher had helped to establish the Fraser Institute, the Manhattan Institute and the Pacific Research Institute in the 1970s. Fisher conceived of Atlas as a means to connect various think tanks via a global network through which the organizations could learn best practices from one another and \"pass the best research and policy ideas from one to the other, and so avoid the need to reinvent the wheel.\" Atlas has been described as \"self replicating, a think tank that creates think tanks.\"\n\nAccording to the \"2019 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report\", Atlas is ranked number 54 (of 109) in the \"Top Think Tanks in the United States\". \n\nThe chief executive officer of Atlas Network is Brad Lips. Lips joined Atlas Network, then known as Atlas Economic Research Foundation, in 1999 and became CEO in 2009. Matt Warner is President.\n\nAs of 2005, Atlas had received $440,000 from ExxonMobil, and has received at least $825,000 USD from the tobacco company Philip Morris.

The project seeks to define principles of \"sound money,\" countering the government policies Atlas considers to be inflationary.\n\nAtlas provides limited amounts of financial support to new think tanks on a case-by-case basis. Grants are usually given for specific projects and range between $2,000 and $5,000. In 2014 Atlas Network provided funding in the form of grants at USD 4,340,000 to 177 partners in 68 different countries.\n\nThe organization has provided grants to free-market think tanks in Latin America, including to groups that supported the Free Brazil Movement. Atlas provided funding to a think tank that merged with the political party formed by Mauricio Macri, a businessman who became the president of Argentina. Atlas has also supported the anti-government movement in Venezuela and the campaign of Sebastián Piñera, the president of Chile.\n\nAtlas Network's Doing Development Differently campaign is guided by the principles of a global manifesto published by the Building State Capability program at Harvard University's Center for Global Development Global Initiative. \n\nAwarded since 2004, the Templeton Freedom Award is named for the late investor and philanthropist Sir John Templeton.

It occupies much of the area formerly known as Yesler Hill, Yesler's Hill, or Profanity Hill. The development is administered by the Seattle Housing Authority, who have been redeveloping the neighborhood into a mixed-income area with multi-story buildings and community amenities since 2013.\n\nThe name derives ultimately from Henry Yesler, pioneer mill owner. Yesler Way was originally the skid road on which logs were skidded down to the mill. The southern part of the hill came to be known as Yesler's Hill, Yesler Hill, or Profanity Hill. These names referred roughly to the part of First Hill south of the original King County Courthouse at 8th Avenue and Terrace Street. Razed in 1931, the courthouse site was roughly the western portion of the present-day Harborview Medical Center. The name \"Profanity Hill\" could have its origins from the cursing of the attorneys and litigants at having to climb so steep a grade after missing the cable car, or because of the slum neighborhood known for its uncouth inhabitants to the south where Yesler Terrace is now situated.\n\nYesler Terrace is located on the southernmost part of First Hill, along Yesler Way immediately east of downtown Seattle. Uphill across Interstate 5 from Pioneer Square and the International District. Much of the site included Nihonmachi or Japantown until Executive Order 9066 ordered residents to be interned.\n\nYesler Terrace sits on with 561 residential units in 68 buildings, many of which are two-story rowhouses. Unlike most public housing developments, residents have their own private yards.\n\nAs of 2005, there were 1,167 residents. An estimated 38% of households are Asian or Asian American, 40% are African or African American, 11% are White, and 3% Native American.\n\nTalks of redeveloping the 60-year-old Yesler Terrace, which had become the oldest public housing project in the city, began in 2004 amid similar schemes to redevelop Rainier Vista, High Point and NewHolly into mixed-income neighborhoods. Formal planning on the project began in 2006 with the hiring of a planning team and recruitment for a citizen review panel.\n\nThe $1.7 billion redevelopment project of the neighborhood began in 2013, with plans to replace existing homes with 5,000 mixed-income residential units, of office space, and of retail and community space. The new development will include at least 561 units for those earning 30% of the area median income (AMI) or less as well as 290 units for 60% of AMI and 850 units for 80% of AMI. The SHA partnered with developer Vulcan Real Estate, who would buy and develop private parcels, and architects Weber Thompson. The first new building, Kebero Court, opened in May 2015 and was followed by the opening of Raven Terrace in February 2016. The project, the largest such redevelopment in Seattle's history, is anticipated to take up to 20 years for the full buildout.\n\nThe First Hill Streetcar, which began operation in 2016, connects Yesler Terrace to Capitol Hill via Broadway, and the International District via Jackson Street.\n\nPrior to the start of construction, existing Yesler Terrace residents had organized to oppose any redevelopment plans that would reduce the number of units available to residents with the lowest income.\n\n"}

He also lived for a year at Reval on the coast of Estonia, where he wrote many love-songs.\n\nBorn at Hartenstein, in Vogtland, Saxony, the son of Abraham Fleming, a well-to-do Lutheran pastor, Fleming received his early education from his father before attending a school at Mittweida and then the famous \"\" at Leipzig. He received his initial medical training at the University of Leipzig, where he also studied literature and graduated as a Doctor of Philosophy before gaining his medical doctorate at the University of Hamburg.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War drove Fleming to Holstein, where in 1633 Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, engaged him as physician, courtier and steward. Towards the end of 1633 the Duke sent Fleming with Adam Olearius as a member of an embassy to Russia and the Persian Empire headed by Otto Brüggemann and Philipp Kruse. Fleming was outside Germany for almost six years, much of them in the two foreign empires. Travelling into Russia, Fleming was in an advance party of the embassy which went to Novgorod, where he remained while negotiations went on with the Swedes and the Russians. At the end of July 1634 the ambassadors joined the party, and the embassy proceeded to Moscow, arriving on August 14. After four months in the capital city, the Holstein embassy departed again for the Baltic on Christmas Eve, 1634, and on January 10 arrived at Reval (now Tallinn) in Swedish Estonia. While the ambassadors continued to Gottorp some of the party, including Fleming, remained in Reval. In the event, Fleming was there for about a year, during which he organized a poetry circle called \"the Shepherds\". Not long after his arrival in Reval, Fleming began his courtship of Elsabe Niehus, the daughter of Heinrich Niehus, a merchant originally from Hamburg. He wrote love poems for her, and they became engaged to be married. In 1636 the embassy proceeded to Persia, by way of a further visit to Moscow, and Elsabe was left behind. Fleming's \"Epistolae ex Persia\" were four letters in verse written during his time in Persia, between 1636 and 1638. The embassy was at Isfahan in 1637. On returning to Reval, Fleming found that Elsabe had married another man and became engaged to her sister, Anna Niehus.\nIn 1639 Fleming resumed his medical studies at the University of Leiden, and in 1640 was awarded a doctorate. He settled in Hamburg, where he died on April 2, 1640.\n\nWith his contemporaries Martin Opitz (1597–1639), Andreas Gryphius (1616–1664), Christian Hoffmann von Hoffmannswaldau (1616–1679) and the rather later Daniel Casper von Lohenstein (1635–1683), Fleming is one of the writers now called \"the Silesian poets\" or \"the Silesian school\". As a lyricist he stands in the front rank of German poets.\nFleming's well-known poems include ' (On the Death of a Child) and \"Madrigal\". A number of his sonnets are about the places he visited in his travels. The only collections published in his lifetime were \"Rubella seu Suaviorum Liber\" (1631) and \"Klagegedichte über das unschuldigste Leiden und Tod unsers Erlösers Jesu Christi\" (Laments concerning the most innocent Suffering and Death of our Saviour Jesus Christ), printed early in 1632, the second of which begins with an invocation of Melpomene, the Muse of tragedy. His ' (Poems in German), published posthumously in 1642, was later renamed \"\" (Spiritual and Secular Poems) and contains many notable love-songs.\n\nFleming wrote in Latin as well as in German, and his Latin poems were published in a single volume in 1863, edited by Johann Martin Lappenberg. Fleming has been called a man of \"real poetic genius\", \"the only good poet in Germany during the Thirty Years' War\", \"possibly the greatest German lyric poet of the seventeenth century\" and \"the German Herrick\". Günter Grass has called him \"one of the major figures in German seventeenth-century literature\".\n\nFleming wrote the hymn in nine stanzas \"\" (In all that I do) on the melody of \"\" by Heinrich Isaac, which is contained in several hymnals. Johann Sebastian Bach used the final stanza to close both cantatas ' (BWV 13) and \"Sie werden euch in den Bann tun\" (BWV 44). The complete hymn is the base for Bach's chorale cantata ' (BWV 97). Already in the 17th century another composer, David Pohle (1624–1695), had set twelve of Fleming's love-songs to music.\n\nSource: \n\n\n"}

Snowmass Mountain should not be confused with the Snowmass ski area, located outside Snowmass Village; nor with nearby Snowmass Peak, a lower but more visually striking peak that towers over Snowmass Lake. Hagerman Peak sits between Snowmass Mountain and Snowmass Peak and is also often mistaken for Snowmass Mountain.\n\nThe route most commonly used to climb Snowmass Mountain is the Snowmass Creek approach. The route to the summit starts at Snowmass Lake, which is itself an hike up Snowmass Creek from the parking area. Most people hike to the lake, camp the night and then proceed to the top. This route is recommended in the spring and early summer when the snowfield still covers much of the route; however an ice axe and crampons are recommended for travel on the snowfield. Later in the summer there is more travel on talus (scree) and more danger from rockfall. An alternative in snow-free conditions is to hike up to the saddle between the peak and Hagerman Peak.

{"id": "1791156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791156", "title": "Implicit-association test", "text": "Implicit-association test\n\nThe implicit-association test (IAT) is a measure within social psychology designed to detect the strength of a person's subconscious association between mental representations of objects (concepts) in memory. It is commonly applied to assess implicit stereotypes held by test subjects, such as unconsciously associating stereotypically black names with words consistent with black stereotypes. The test's format is highly versatile, and has been used to investigate biases in racial groups, gender, sexuality, age, and religion, as well as assessing self-esteem.\n\nThe IAT was introduced in the scientific literature in 1998 by Anthony Greenwald, Debbie McGhee, and Jordan Schwartz. The IAT is now widely used in social psychology research and, to some extent, in clinical, cognitive, and developmental psychology research. The IAT is the subject of much controversy regarding validity, reliability, and whether test results are an accurate representation of implicit bias.\n\nIn 1995, social psychology researchers Anthony Greenwald and Mahzarin Banaji asserted that the idea of implicit and explicit memory can apply to social constructs as well. If memories that are not accessible to awareness can influence our actions, associations can also influence our attitudes and behavior. Thus, measures that tap into individual differences in associations of concepts should be developed. This would allow researchers to understand attitudes that cannot be measured through explicit self-report methods due to lack of awareness or social-desirability bias. In essence,the purpose of the IAT was to reliably assess individual differences in a manner producing large effect sizes. The first IAT article was published three years later in 1998.\n\nSince its original publication date, the seminal IAT article has been cited over 4,000 times, making it one of the most influential psychological developments over the past couple of decades. Furthermore, several variations in IAT procedure have been introduced to address test limitations, while numerous applications of the IAT were also developed, including versions investigating bias against obesity, suicide risk, romantic attachment, attitudes regarding sexuality, and political preferences, among others. Finally, as is characteristic of any psychological instrumentation, discussion and debate of the IAT's reliability and validity has continued since its introduction, particularly because these factors vary between different variations of the test.\n\nA computer-based measure, the IAT requires that users rapidly categorize two target concepts with an attribute (e.g. the concepts \"male\" and \"female\" with the attribute \"logical\"), such that easier pairings (faster responses) are interpreted as more strongly associated in memory than difficult pairings (slower responses).\n\nThe IAT is thought to measure implicit attitudes: \"introspectively unidentified (or inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought, or action toward social objects.\" In research, the IAT has been used to develop theories to understand implicit cognition (i.e. cognitive processes of which a person has no conscious awareness). These processes may include memory, perception, attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes. Because the IAT requires that users make a series of rapid judgments, researchers believe that IAT scores may also reflect attitudes which people are unwilling to reveal publicly. The IAT may allow researchers to get around the difficult problem of social-desirability bias and for that reason it has been used extensively to assess people's attitudes towards commonly stigmatized groups, such as African Americans and Individuals who identify as homosexual.\n\nA typical IAT procedure involves a series of seven tasks. In the first task, an individual is asked to categorize stimuli into two categories. For example, a person might be presented with a computer screen on which the word \"Black\" appears in the top left-hand corner and the word \"White\" appears in the top right-hand corner. In the middle of the screen a word, such as a first name, that is typically associated with either the categories of \"Black\" or \"White\". For each word that appears in the middle of the screen, the person is asked to sort the word into the appropriate category by pressing the appropriate left-hand or right-hand key. On the second task, the person would complete a similar sorting procedure with an attribute of some kind. For example, the word \"Pleasant\" might now appear in the top left-hand corner of the screen and the word \"Unpleasant\" in the top right-hand corner. In the middle of the screen would appear a word that is either pleasant or unpleasant. Once again, the person would be asked to sort each word as being either pleasant or unpleasant by pressing the appropriate key. On the third task, individuals are asked to complete a combined task that includes both the categories and attributes from the first two tasks. In this example, the words \"Black/Pleasant\" might appear in the top left-hand corner while the words \"White/Unpleasant\" would appear in the top right-hand corner. Individuals would then see a series of stimuli in the center of the screen consisting of either a name or word. They would be asked to press the left-hand key if the name or word belongs to the \"Black/Pleasant\" category or the right-hand key if it belongs to the \"White/Unpleasant\" category. The fourth task is a repeat of the third task but with more repetitions of the names, words, or images.\n\nThe fifth task is a repeat of the first task with the exception that the position of the two target words would be reversed. For example, \"Black\" would now appear in the top right-hand corner of the screen and \"White\" in the top left-hand corner. The sixth task would be a repeat of the third, except that the objects and subjects of study would be in opposite pairings from previous trials. In this case, \"Black/Unpleasant\" would now appear in the top right-hand corner and \"White/Pleasant\" would now appear in the top left-hand corner. The seventh task is a repeat of the sixth task but with more repetitions of the names, words, or images. If the categories under study (e.g. Black or White) are associated with the presented attributes (e.g. Pleasant/Unpleasant) to differing degrees, the pairing reflecting the stronger association (or the \"compatible\" pairing) should be easier for the participant. In the Black/White-Pleasant/Unpleasant example, a participant will be able to categorize more quickly when Black and Pleasant are paired together than when White and Pleasant are paired if he or she has more positive associations with Black people than with White people (and vice versa if White and Pleasant are categorized more quickly).\n\nVariations of the IAT include the Go/No-go Association Test (GNAT), the Brief-IAT and the Single-Category IAT. An idiographic approach using the IAT and the SC-IAT for measuring implicit anxiety showed that personalized stimulus selection did not affect the outcome, reliabilities and correlations to outside criteria.\n\nThe Go/No-go Association Test (GNAT) is a variation of the IAT that assesses implicit attitudes or beliefs by measuring the relationship between a target concept and two different extremes of an attribute. Specifically, the strength of relationship is assessed by how quickly the items belonging to the target category and specific attribute (yellow and good or yellow and bad) can be picked from surrounding distractor items that are not associated with the target concept or attribute. Respondents are required to press a key when they identify a stimulus that belongs to one of these categories, and not to press a key when they see stimuli that does not belong to those categories. The difference in ability to correctly associate the concept with the specific attributes is described to be the measure of automatic attitude. Unlike the IAT, which measures response latency, the GNAT measures accuracy in identifying the specific relationships between the target concept and specific attributes.\n\nThe Single Category IAT, also known as Single-Target IAT (ST-IAT), is unique in that it uses one target category instead of the two required in the original IAT. During the ST-IAT, respondents complete a discrimination block of the evaluative stimuli. The second block consists of sorting target concepts and positive items with one response key and negative items with the other. In the last block, respondents are required to sort target stimuli and negative items together with one key, and positive items with the other key. In comparison to the IAT, which uses contrasts in latency between two concepts and two attributes, the ST-IAT focuses on latency differences in relation to one concept and two attributes.\n\nValence IATs measure associations between concepts and positive or negative valence. They are generally interpreted as a preference for one category over another. For example, the Race IAT shows that more than 70% of individuals have an implicit preference for Whites over Blacks. On the other hand, only half of Black individuals prefer Blacks over Whites (\"cf.\" the earlier \"doll experiment\" developed by psychologists Kenneth and Mamie Clark during the early civil rights era). Similarly, the Age IAT generally shows that most individuals have an implicit preference for young over old, regardless of the age of the person taking the IAT. The Weight IAT indicates that medical students have lower implicit biases towards obese individuals compared to the general public, but increased explicit biases, although public explicit and implicit biases remained stable. Research with the Sexuality IAT shows that heterosexual individuals have an implicit preference for heterosexuals, associating them with more positive attributes. In contrast, bisexual individuals indicated a preference for heterosexuals over homosexuals, specifically as a result of attributing homosexuals to negative attributes. Neither of these trends of attributing more positive or negative attributes to a specific sexual identity are seen with homosexual respondents. Some other valence IATs include the Weight IAT, the Sexuality IAT, the Arab-Muslim IAT, and the Skin-tone IAT.\n\nStereotype IATs measure associations between concepts that often reflect the strength to which a person holds a particular societal stereotype. For example, the Gender-Science IAT reveals that most people associate women more strongly with liberal arts and men more strongly with science. Similarly, the Gender-Career IAT indicates that most people associate women more strongly with family and men more strongly with careers. The Asian IAT shows that many people more strongly associate Asian Americans with foreign landmarks and European Americans more strongly with American landmarks. Some other stereotype IATs include the Weapons IAT and the Native IAT.\n\nThe self-esteem IAT measures implicit self-esteem by pairing \"self\" and \"other\" words with words of positive and negative valence. Those who find it easier to pair \"self\" with positive words than negative words are purported to have higher implicit self-esteem. Generally, measures of implicit self-esteem, including the IAT, are not strongly related to one another and are not strongly related to explicit measures of self-esteem.\n\nThe Brief IAT (BIAT) uses a similar procedure to the standard IAT but requires fewer classifications. It involves approximately four to six tasks rather than seven, only uses combined tasks (corresponding most closely to tasks 3, 4, 6, and 7 on the standard IAT), and has fewer repetitions. Additionally, it requires specification of a focal concept in each task as well as a single attribute, instead of two. For example, although, White, Black, Pleasant, and Unpleasant stimuli all appear, participants would press one key when White and Pleasant words appear and another key when \"anything else\" appears. Subsequently, participants would press one key when Black and Pleasant words appear and another key when \"anything else\" appears. Unlike the GNAT, the Brief IAT doesn't not use accuracy of correctly identifying the specific concept and attribute requested. Instead, the latency is used to acquire results.\n\nThe Child IAT (Ch-IAT) allows for children as young as four years of age to take the IAT. Rather than words and pictures, the Ch-IAT uses sound and pictures. For example, positive and negative valence are indicated with smiling and frowning faces. Positive and negative words to be classified are voiced out loud to children.\n\nStudies using the Ch-IAT have revealed that six-year-old White children, ten-year-old White children, and White adults have comparable implicit attitudes on the Race IAT.\n\nAccording to Greenwald, the IAT provides a \"window\" into a level of mental operation that operates in unthinking (unconscious, automatic, implicit, impulsive, intuitive, etc.) fashion because associations operating without active thought (automatically) can help performance in one of the IAT's two \"combined\" tasks, while interfering with the other. Respondents to the IAT experience a higher (conscious, controlled, explicit, reflective, analytic, rational, etc.) level of mental operation, when they try to overcome the effects of the automatic associations. The IAT succeeds as a measure because the higher level fails to completely overcome the lower level.\n\nThe interpretation that the IAT provides a \"window\" to unconscious mental contents has been challenged by Hahn and colleagues, whose results indicated that people are highly accurate in predicting their own IAT scores for a variety of social groups.\n\nDe Houwer theorizes that the IAT is a measure of a response compatibility effect, in which participants first learn to associate positive and negative words and concepts with pressing specific keys on the keyboard. Later in the test, when participants are instructed to sort words and concepts that are both negative and positive with the same keyboard key, De Houwer argues that much of the latency and incorrect responses that result from this change are due to the increased cognitive complexity of the task, and not necessarily a reflection of implicit bias.\n\nBrendl, Markman, and Messner have proposed a random walk model process to explain responses in the critical portions of the IAT. They theorize that test respondents base their responses on a process of mental evidence-gathering that continues until the evidence for one option or the other (right or left key) reaches a threshold, at which time a decision is made, and action is taken. This requires consideration of both the concept and the attribute, which can be congruent or incongruent - all factors that affect decision speed. All evidence during the compatible block of the test is congruent, allowing for fast decision-making. However, incongruent concept and attribute in the incompatible task leads to longer processing time. Increased task difficulty also increases evidence threshold criterion, further decreasing decision speed.\n\nAn alternative or complementary theory from Mierke and Klauer holds that the cognitive control processes required to switch back and forth between categorizing based on concept versus based on attribute leads to reduced speeds in the critical blocks of the test. In other words, it is much less mentally demanding to sort concepts in the compatible block when only one aspect of the concept must be focused upon. Comparatively, sorting concepts in the incompatible block, which requires focusing on both concept and attribute not only takes longer to process because of the increased complexity, but also because the previous concept may have required a different cognitive effort.\n\nFiinally, Rothermund and Wentura propose a figure-ground model of explanation for the IAT. In essence, this theory suggests that IAT respondents simplify their task by relying on salience. For example, negative is salient for most people, so if a respondent is to press the right key for negative words, the individual will plan to press the right key for all negative words (figure), and the left key for any other (non-negative) words (ground). This leads to fast decision-making in the compatible task and two of the critical tasks, but not for the third critical task, in which two salient categories require different keys pushed.\n\nThere is empirical support for all these explanations of the IAT's effects, but this is not necessarily evidence against the IAT's overall validity, as these theories are not mutually exclusive. Furthermore, regardless of the fundamental cognitive processes of the IAT, studies show that multiple implementations of the test validly measure their targeted constructs, and the psychometric value of each implementation varies as a function of its individual characteristics (e.g., construct measured, participant characteristics, testing environment).\n\nIn 1958, Fritz Heider proposed the balance theory, which stated that a system of liking and disliking relationships is balanced if the product of the valence of all relationships within the system is positive. In the theory, there are concepts and associations. Concepts are persons, groups, or attributes; and among attribute concepts, there are positive and negative valences. Associations are relations between pairs of concepts, and the strength of association is the potential for one concept to activate another, either by external stimuli or by excitation through their associations with other, already active, concepts. The theory followed the assumption of associative social knowledge: an important portion of social knowledge could be represented as a network of variable-strength associations among person concepts (including self and groups) and attributes (including valence).\n\nWhen two unlinked or weakly linked nodes are linked to the same third node, the association between these two should strengthen. This is the principle of balance–congruity. The nodes in the principle of balance–congruity are equivalent to the concepts in Heider's balance theory, and the three involved nodes/concepts make up a system. Since every relationship within the system here is positively associated, this, according to a derivation of Heider's theory, also represents a balanced system where the product of the direction of all associations within the system is positive.\n\nIn 2002, Greenwald and his colleagues introduced the balanced-identity design as a method to test correlational predictions of Heider's balance theory. The balanced identity design incorporated Heider's theory, the balance–congruity principle, and the assumption of centrality of self. The assumption of centrality of self is that in an associative knowledge structure, the self's centrality can be represented by its being associated with many other concepts that are themselves highly connected in the structure. The concepts in a typical balanced identity design are the self, a social group/object, and either a valence attribute or nonvalence attribute. There are thus five important associations possible in a typical balanced identity design that connect these three categories of concepts. An attitude is the association of a social group/object with a valence attribute; a stereotype is the association of a social group with one or more nonvalence attribute(s); self-esteem is the association of the self with a valence attribute; a self-concept is the association of the self with one or more nonvalence attribute(s); and the last important association is between the self and a social group/object, which is called an identity. However, in a typical balanced identity design, only three of the five possible associations come into play, and they are usually either identity, self-concept, and stereotype or identity, self-esteem, and attitude. Researchers using a balanced identity design are the ones to determine the set of concepts they want to investigate, and each one of the associations within the system that the researchers created will then be tested and analyzed statistically with both implicit and explicit measures.\n\nA typical result of a balanced identity design usually shows that a group's identity is balanced, at least with implicit measures. According to a derivation of Heider's balance theory, since there are three concepts in a typical balanced identity design, the identity is balanced either when all three relations are positive or when one positive and two negative relations are present in the triad system. The triad system of \"me—male—being good at math\" will be used as an example here, and its typical result acquired from the Implicit Association Test (IAT) will be shown below. For male subjects, the three associations within the triad are usually all positive. For female subjects, the \"me—male\" association is usually negative, the \"male—being good at math\" association is usually positive, and the \"me—being good at math\" association is usually negative. As it's shown, for both the male and female subjects, their group identities are balanced.\n\nSelf-reporting is also usually used in a balanced identity design. Although self-reports don't necessarily reflect the predicted consistency patterns from Heider's theory, it is often used to compare with the results from the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Any discrepancies between the self-reports and the IAT results on the same association in a balanced identity design can be an indication of an experience of conflict. The above triad system of \"me—male—being good at math\" is a good example. For female subjects, whereas the Implicit Association Test (IAT) typically shows a stronger positive association of \"male\" and \"being good at math,\" the explicit self-reporting usually shows a weaker positive association or even a weaker negative association of \"male\" and \"being good at math.\" Also, whereas the IAT typically shows a stronger negative association of \"me\" and \"being good at math\" for the same female subjects, the self-reporting usually shows a weaker negative or even a weaker positive association of \"me\" and \"being good at math.\" In this case, the female group is believed to be experiencing a conflict. The common explanation for a group experiencing a conflict is that in an effort to change a stereotypical view that has been around in the society for a really long time, even though people who belong to a certain social group believe that they are able to reject this stereotype (shown in explicit measures), the exact stereotypical thought is still going to remain in the back of their heads (shown in implicit measures), maybe not as much as those who actually believe in that thought. So maybe with time, as a stereotype gradually fades away, that conflict will fade away as well.\n\nThe IAT has been widely used as a measure for the balanced identity design because data obtained with this method revealed that predicted consistency patterns from Heider's theory were strongly apparent in the data for implicit measures by IAT but not in those for parallel explicit measures by self-report. The general explanation for why explicit measures by self-report did not reflect the predicted consistency patterns from Heider's theory was that self-report measures can go astray when respondents are either unwilling or unable to report accurately, and these problems could be more than enough to obscure the operation of consistency processes. There are, however, still limitations to the theory. For example, the balanced identity IAT measures only give group results rather than individual results, so it has its limitations when an analysis requires for individual pinpoint data to analyze, for instance, how balanced one's identity is relative to others'. It is hopeful, however, that researchers working with the Implicit Association Test (IAT) are trying hard to overcome challenges such as the one described above.\n\nThe IAT has engendered some controversy in both the scientific literature and in the public sphere (e.g. in the \"Wall Street Journal\"). For example, it has been interpreted as assessing familiarity, perceptual salience asymmetries, or mere cultural knowledge irrespective of personal endorsement of that knowledge. A more recent critique argued that there is a lack of empirical research justifying the diagnostic statements that are given to the lay public. For instance, feedback may report that someone has a [slight/moderate/strong] automatic preference for [European Americans/African Americans]. Proponents of the IAT have responded to these charges, but the debate continues. According to \"The New York Times\", \"there isn't even that much consistency in the same person's scores if the test is taken again\". In addition, researchers have recently claimed that results of the IAT might be biased by the participant's lacking cognitive capability to adjust to switching categories, thus biasing results in favor of the first category pairing (e.g. pairing \"Asian\" with positive stimuli first, instead of pairing \"Asian\" with negative stimuli first).\n\nAccording to Jesse Singal, some of these issues have been settled in the research literature, but others continue to inspire debate among researchers and lay people alike.\n\nSince its introduction into the scientific literature in 1998, a great deal of research has been conducted in order to examine the psychometric properties of the IAT as well as to address other criticisms on validity and reliability.\n\nThe IAT is purported to measure relative strength of associations. However, some researchers have asserted that the IAT may instead be measuring constructs such as salience of attributes or cultural knowledge.\n\nA 2009 meta-analysis concluded that the IAT has predictive validity independent of the predictive validity of explicit measures. However, a follow-up meta-analysis questioned some of these results, finding that implicit measures were only weakly predictive of behaviors and no better than explicit measures. Some research has found that the IAT tends to be a better predictor of behavior in socially sensitive contexts (e.g. discrimination and suicidal behaviour) than traditional \"explicit\" self-report methods, whereas explicit measures tend to be better predictors of behavior in less socially sensitive contexts (e.g. political preferences). Specifically, the IAT has been shown to predict voting behavior (e.g. ultimate candidate choice of undecided voters), mental health (e.g. a self-injury IAT differentiated between adolescents who injured themselves and those who did not), medical outcomes (e.g. medical recommendations by physicians), employment outcomes (e.g. interviewing Muslim-Arab versus Swedish job applicants), education outcomes (e.g. gender-science stereotypes predict gender disparities in nations' science and math test scores), and environmentalism (e.g., membership of a pro-environmental organisation).\n\nWhen patients were tested on their subconscious feelings towards death, suicidal patients are put at risk. Research shows that those experiencing deep suicidal thoughts are not likely to share their true experiences. \n\nIn applied settings, the IAT has been used in marketing and industrial psychology. For example, in determining the predictors of risk-taking behaviour of pilots in general aviation, attitudes towards risky flight behaviour as measured through an IAT have shown to be a more accurate forecast of risky flight behaviour than traditional explicit attitude or personality scales. The IAT has also been used in clinical psychology research to test the hypothesis that implicit associations may be a causal factor in the development of anxiety disorders.\n\nResearchers have argued that the IAT may measure salience of concepts rather than associations. Whereas IAT proponents claim that faster response times when pairing concepts indicate stronger associations, critics claim that faster response times indicate that concepts are similar in salience (and slower response times indicate that concepts differ in salience). There is some support for this claim. For example, in an old-young IAT, old faces would be more salient than young faces. As a result, researchers created an old-young IAT that involved pairing young and old faces with neutral words (non-salient attribute) and non-words (salient attribute). Response times were faster when old faces (salient) were paired with non-words (salient) than when old faces (salient) were paired with neutral words (non-salient), supporting the assertion that faster response time can be facilitated by matching salience.\n\nAlthough proponents of the IAT acknowledge that it may be influenced by salience asymmetry, they argue that this does not preclude interpreting the IAT as a measure of associations.\n\nAnother criticism of the IAT is that it may measure associations that are picked up from cultural knowledge rather than associations actually residing within a person. The counter-argument is that such associations may indeed arise from the culture, but they can nonetheless influence behavior.\n\nTo address the possibility that the IAT picks up on cultural knowledge rather than beliefs that are present in a person, some critics of the standard IAT created the personalized IAT. The primary difference between a standard valence IAT and the personalized IAT is that rather than using pleasant and unpleasant words as category labels, it uses \"I like\" and \"I don't like\" as category labels. Additionally, the Personalized IAT does not provide error feedback for an incorrect response as in the standard IAT. This form of the IAT is more strongly related to explicit self-report measures of bias.\n\nProponents of the standard IAT argue that the Personalized IAT increases the likelihood that those taking it will evaluate the concept rather than classify it. This would increase its relationship with explicit measures without necessarily removing the effect of cultural knowledge. In fact, some researchers have examined the relationship between perceptions of general American attitudes and Personalized IAT scores and have concluded that the relationship between the IAT and cultural knowledge is not decreased by personalizing it. However, it is important to note that there was no relationship between cultural knowledge and standard IAT scores either.\n\nThe IAT has also demonstrated a reasonable amount of resistance to social-desirability bias. Individuals asked to fake their responses on the IAT have demonstrated difficulty in doing so in some studies. For example, participants who were asked to present a positive impression of themselves were able to do so on a self-report measure of anxiety but not an IAT measuring anxiety. Nonetheless, faking is possible, and recent research indicates that the most effective method of faking the IAT is to intentionally slow down responses for pairings that should be relatively easy. Most subjects, however, do not discover this strategy on their own, so faking is relatively rare. An algorithm developed to estimate IAT faking can identify those who are faking with approximately 75% accuracy.\n\nThere is a recent study showing that participants can even speed up their responses during the relatively difficult response pairings in an autobiographical implicit association test that aims to test the veracity of autobiographical statement. Specifically, participants who were instructed to speed up their responses to fake the test were able to do so. The effect was larger when participants were trained in speeding up. Most importantly, guilty participants who speed up their responses during the difficult response pairing successfully beat the test to obtain an innocent result. In other words, participants can reverse their test outcome without being detected.\n\nDistinct from faking (the deliberate obscuring of a true association), some studies have shown that heightening awareness about the nature of the test can change the outcome, potentially by activating different fluencies and associations. For example, in one study, a simple reminder from the experimenter (\"Please be careful not to stereotype on the next section of the task\") was sufficient to significantly reduce the expression of biased associations on a race IAT. Notably, there was not a significant decrease in overall reaction time in this experiment, indicating that this \"control\" may also be implicit.\n\nA common criticism of the IAT is that it may be difficult to associate positive attributes with less familiar concepts. For example, if a person has had less contact with members of a particular ethnic group, he or she may have a more difficult time associating members of that ethnic group with positive words simply because of this lack of familiarity. There is some evidence against the familiarity based on studies that have ensured equal familiarity with the African American and White names as well as the faces appearing on the Race IAT.\n\nAs the IAT relies on a comparison of response times in different tasks pairing concepts and attributes, researchers and others taking the IAT have speculated that the pairing on the first combined task may affect performance on the next combined task. For example, a participant who begins a gender stereotype IAT by pairing female names with family words may subsequently find the task of pairing female names with career words more difficult. Research has indeed shown a small effect of order. As a result, it is recommended to increase the number of classifications required in the fifth IAT task. This gives participants more practice before doing the second pairing, thus reducing the order effect. When studying groups of people, this effect could be countered by giving pairings first to different participants (e.g. half of participants pair female names and family words first, the other half pair female names with career words first).\n\nThe IAT is influenced by individual differences in average IAT response times such that those with slower overall response times tend to have more extreme IAT scores. Older subjects also tend to have more extreme IAT scores, and this may be related to cognitive fluency, or slower overall response times.\n\nAn improved scoring algorithm for the IAT, which reduces the effect of cognitive fluency on the IAT, has been introduced. A summary of the scoring algorithm can be found on Greenwald's webpage.\n\nRepeated administrations of the IAT tend to decrease the magnitude of the effect for a particular person. This issue is somewhat ameliorated with the improved scoring algorithm. An additional safeguard to control for IAT experience is to include a different type of IAT as a comparison. This allows researchers to evaluate the degree of magnitude decrease when administering subsequent IATs.\n\nThe act of taking the Race IAT has also been found to exacerbate the negative implicit attitudes that it seeks to assess. Results from four pre-registered experiments demonstrated that completing a Race IAT resulted in increases in White participants’ negative automatic racial evaluations of Black people as measured by two different implicit measures (Single Category IAT and the Affective Misattribution Procedure) but did not generalize to another measure of automatic racial bias(Shooter Bias Task).\n\nThe IAT demonstrates inconsistent internal consistency and its test-retest reliability stands at 0.60, a relatively weak level. IAT scores also seem to vary between multiple administrations, indicating that it may measure a combination of trait (stable characteristics of people) and state (subject to variation based on situation-specific circumstances) characteristics. One example of the latter case is that scores on the Race IAT are known to be less biased against African Americans when those taking it imagine positive Black exemplars beforehand (e.g. Martin Luther King). Similarly, the Race IAT scores for an individual may indicate bias, but that bias is diminished on another IAT administered after associating with a mixed-race group. In fact, Race IAT scores can be changed even more easily; administering the IAT in different languages yields significantly different scores for bilingual individuals. For example, studies conducted with Moroccan participants fluent in both French and Arabic showed that participants are biased when completing an IAT in their native language; however, that bias is diminished when completing an IAT in another language. Similar results were found in the United States when administering an English and Spanish IAT on bilingual Hispanic Americans. Another state characteristic that may well influence IAT scores is the time of day a person completes the task, with findings that holding a preference for one's own racial group is lowest in the morning, but increases over the course of the day and into the evening; however, this may be more to do with who completes the task at each time of day than a function of circadian rhythms.\n\nAfter establishing the IAT in the scientific literature, Greenwald, along with Mahzarin Banaji (Professor of Psychology at Harvard University) and Brian Nosek (Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Virginia), co-founded Project Implicit, a virtual laboratory and educational outreach organization that facilitates research on implicit cognition.\n\nThe IAT has been profiled in major media outlets (e.g. in the \"Washington Post\") and in the popular book \"Blink,\" where it was suggested that one could score better on the implicit racism test by visualizing respected black leaders such as Nelson Mandela. The IAT was also discussed in a 2006 episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\".\n\nIn the episode \"Racist Dawg\" on \"King of the Hill\", Hank and Peggy take an IAT, colloquially referred to as the \"racist test\" to see if they prefer the company of white or black people.\n\n"}

Her mother remarried to Herbert Kalmus, co-founder of Technicolor, in 1949. \n\nWhile her acting career only spanned four years during her childhood, she appeared in two of the biggest films of the era, \"Gone with the Wind\" and \"Bambi\". She landed the part of Bonnie Blue Butler in \"Gone With the Wind\" at the age of four after casting directors had tested 250 applicants for the role, including her seven-year-old sister Diane. After Diane was deemed too old for the part, she told the staff, \"My sister looks like me and is only four and she can read lines\". Cammie did remember her lines, but she was unable keep her eyelids from moving during Bonnie's death scene and was fitted with a death mask. An adult male little person served as a body double for Bonnie's fall from the horse. \n\nCammie provided the voice of Faline as a fawn in Disney's 1942 film \"Bambi\".

Paul began work as a mechanical worker in a machine factory but he saw that to make any progress in his profession, he had to be able to draw; accordingly in his spare time in the evenings, he took classes in drawing. He devoted his special attention to architectural and mechanical drawing and worked at land surveying and mapping which led to his obtaining a position with the Government Ordnance Department as a draughtsman. It wasn't until his early thirties that he turned his attention to his proper vocation as an artist.\n\nThe story is told that he took his name from Gavarnie in Luz-Saint-Sauveur where he had taken a journey into the Pyrenees.\n\nHis first published drawings were for the magazine \"Journal des modes\".\n\nAt the time, Gavarni was barely thirty years of age. His sharp and witty drawings gave these generally commonplace and unartistic figures a life-likeness and an expression which soon won him a name in fashionable circles. He gradually gave greater attention to this more congenial work, and ultimately stopped working as an engineer to become the director of the journal \"Les Gens du monde\".\n\nGavarni followed his interests, and began a series of lithographed sketches in which he portrayed the most striking characteristics, foibles and vices of the various classes of French society. The letterpress explanations attached to his drawings were short, but were forcible and humorous, if sometimes trivial, and were adapted to the particular subjects. At first he confined himself to the study of Parisian manners, more especially those of the Parisian youth.\n\nMost of his best work appeared in \"Le Charivari\". He had been invited by the editor François Caboche to draw for the magazine. Gavarni had never drawn caricatures and was reluctant to accept the request but was persuaded to submit some drawings for approval. This he did and they were accepted but he didn't care for the captions which had been added by the magazine editors. Thereafter, he started writing his own. This was the beginning of the \"Boites aux lettres\" series.\n\nSome of his most scathing and most earnest pictures, the fruit of a visit to London, appeared in \"L'Illustration\". He also illustrated Honoré de Balzac's novels, and Eugène Sue's \"Wandering Jew\".\n\nAmong his illustrated works were \"Les Lorettes, Les Actrices, Les Coulisses, Les Fasizionables, Les Gentilshommes bourgeois, Les Artistes, Les Débardeurs, Clichy, Les Étudiants de Paris, Les Baliverneries parisiennes, Les Plaisirs champêtres, Les Bals masqués, Le Carnaval, Les Souvenirs du carnaval, Les Souvenirs du bal Chicard, La Vie des jeunes hommes, and Les Patois de Paris\". He had now ceased to be director of \"Les Gens du monde\"; but he was engaged as ordinary caricaturist of \"Le Charivari\", and, while making the fortune of the paper, he made his own. His name was exceedingly popular, and his illustrations for books were eagerly sought for by publishers. \"Le Juif errant\", by Eugene Sue (1843, 4 vols. 8vo), the French translation of Hoffman's tales (1843, 8 vo), the first collective edition of Balzac's works (Paris, Houssiaux, 1850, 20 vols. 8 vo), \"Le Diable à Paris\" (1844–1846, 2 vols. 4 vo), \"Les Français peints par eux-mêmes\" (1840–1843, 9 vols. 8vo), the collection of Physiologies published by Aubert in 38 vols. 18mo (1840–1842), all owed a great part of their success at the time, and are still sought for, on account of the clever and telling sketches contributed by Gavarni.\n\nA single frontispiece or vignette was sometimes enough to secure the sale of a new book. Always desiring to enlarge the field of his observations, Gavarni soon abandoned his once favorite topics. He no longer limited himself to such types as the lorette and the Parisian student, or to the description of the noisy and popular pleasures of the capital, but turned his mirror to the grotesque sides of family life and of humanity at large. \"Les Enfants terribles\", \"Les Parents terribles\", \"Les Fourberies des femmes\", \"La Politique des femmes\", \"Les Mans vengs\", \"Les Nuances du sentiment\", \"Les Rives\", \"Les Petits Jeux de société\", \"Les Fetus Malheurs du bonheur\", \"Les Impressions de ménage\", \"Les Interjections\", \"Les Traductions en langue vulgaire\", \"Les Propos de Thomas Vireloque\", etc., were composed at this time, and are his most elevated productions. But while showing the same power of irony as his former works, enhanced by a deeper insight into human nature, they generally bear the stamp of a bitter and even sometimes gloomy philosophy.\n\nAt one point Gavarni was imprisoned for debt in the debtors' prison of Clichy. After his release, he published his experiences in a work called \"L'Argent\" (\"Money\").\n\nGavarni visited England in 1849. On his return his impressions were published in the book \"Londres et les Anglais, illustrés par Gavarni\" (1862) by Émile de la Bédollière.\n\nMost of these last compositions appeared in the weekly paper \"L'Illustration\". In 1857 he published in one volume the series entitled \"Masques et visages\" (1 vol. 12 mo), and in 1869, about two years after his death, his last artistic work, \"Les Douze Mois\" (1 vol. fol.), was given to the world. Gavarni was much engaged, during the last period of his life, in scientific pursuits, and this fact must perhaps be connected with the great change which then took place in his manner as an artist. He sent several communications to the Académie des Sciences, and until his death on 23 November 1866 he was eagerly interested in the question of aerial navigation. It is said that he made experiments on a large scale with a view to find the means of directing balloons; but it seems that he was not so successful in this line as his fellow artist, the caricaturist and photographer, Nadar.\n\nGavarni's \"Œuvres choisies\" was published in 1845, followed in 1850 by two volumes named \"Perles et Parures\". Some essays in prose and in verse written by him were collected by one of his biographers, Charles Yriarte, and published in 1869. \"Gavarni l'homme et l'œuvre\" by Edmond and Jules de Goncourt was published in 1873. A \"catalogue raisonné\" of Gavarni's works was published by J. Armehault and E. Bocher, paris in 1873.\n\n"}

Both players have one half of the screen. Hitting a landscape or another ship destroys the vessel. Movement of ships is affected by their thrust, gravity and drag in air and liquid. \n\nThe players can choose from various weapons that are advantageous in different situations. Rapid fire weapons are good for causing at least some damage for the opponent and non-rapid fire weapons are good for hitting the opponent hard from proximity. The players can load weapons and fuel on their base platforms. The base platform can also repair a ship. The player needs to make a trade-off between good acceleration (small mass) and the amount of ordnance and fuel loaded. It is also possible to play the game as a time race.\n\n\n"}

It is part of the larger town of Ashton-in-Makerfield and is geographically indistinguishable from it, but forms a separate local council ward. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 11,662. Served by Bryn railway station, Bryn is home to the Three Sisters Recreation Area which has been created from three large spoil tips which remain from Bryn's role in Lancashire's coal mining past. The recreation area is also the site of the Three Sisters Race Circuit, which provides race driving instruction and plays host to kart racing events and motorcycle road race meetings at clubman level.\n\nThe name \"Bryn\" is most likely derived from Cumbric \"brïnn\", meaning 'hill' (compare with modern ). Alternatively, the name may be derived directly from the Welsh equivalent, possibly reflecting Welsh settlement in the 12th century. A third explanation is that the name is derived from Old English \"bryne\", 'burning, fire', suggestive of land cleared by burning.\n\nThe former Bryn (or Brynne) Hall was the seat of the Gerard family beginning in the thirteenth century or earlier. It was a \"safe house\" for the English Roman Catholic martyr and saint Edmund Arrowsmith and his hand was reportedly preserved there after his execution. The house, dating to the fourteenth century, has now completely collapsed and remaining stones have been cleared.\n\nThe Roman Catholic parish of Our Lady of Good Counsel was founded in 1896. In 1902 the foundation stone of the church, dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, was laid by Bishop Thomas Whiteside, the 4th Bishop of Liverpool. The church, on Downall Green Road, was designed in the style popularised by Augustus Pugin and opened on 21 October 1903. On 8 September 1955 the church was consecrated and the holy relics of two early Roman martyrs – Saints Speciosi and Fructuosi, were placed under the altar stone. In the course of over 100 years, the church has been served by 13 priests, the current parish priest being Father John Gorman.\n\nThe Unitarian Park Lane Chapel in Wigan Road was built in 1697, though its congregation was founded in 1662.

His wife Kitty McShane played Old Mother Riley's daughter, Kitty. It was essentially a drag act but also a double act. The couple played music halls, theatres, and broadcast on radio and appeared in films. Lucan was voted sixth biggest British box-office star by the \"Motion Picture Herald\" in 1943.

In 1756, he obtained the appointment of physician to the military hospital in Normandy attached to the army of observation commanded by Marshal d'Estrées, but a severe attack of hospital fever compelled him to leave this post. In 1757, his services were required in the medical staff of the army of Westphalia, where he had the rank of consulting physician, and on his return to Paris he acted as joint editor of the \"Journal des savants\" and the \"Encyclopédie méthodique\". In 1759 he obtained a medical professorship at Montpellier, and in 1774 he was created joint chancellor of the university.\n\nIn 1778, he published his most famous work, \"Nouveaux élémens de la science de l'homme\", in which he employs the expression \"vital principle\" as a convenient term for the cause of the phenomena of life, without committing himself to either a spiritualistic or a materialistic view of its nature. Taking the degree of doctor of civil law in 1780, he secured the appointment of counsellor to the Supreme Court of Aids at Montpellier, but he soon took up his residence in Paris, having been nominated consulting physician to the king.

Appointed as hereditary \"eristavi\" (dukes) of Odishi (Samegrelo) in reward for their military services, the family had become the most powerful feudal house in western Georgia by the 1280s. At that time, the branches of the family governed also Svaneti, Guria, and Bedia.\n\nIn 1542, Duke Levan I Dadiani became hereditary Prince (\"mtavari\") of Mingrelia and established himself as an independent ruler. His descendant Prince Levan III Dadiani was forced to abdicate in 1691 and Dadiani’s relatives from the Chikovani (ჩიქოვანი) family, hitherto Princes of Salipartiano, inherited the title of Princes of Mingrelia and the surname of Dadiani. Accepting Russian sovereignty in 1802, the Dadiani were elevated to the dignity of Prince of the Russian Empire () and enjoyed significant independence in their home affairs. Russia made a de facto annexation of Samegrelo in 1857, but Samegrelo remained nominally in existence until January 4, 1867, when Niko Dadiani, the last Prince of Samegrelo, was deposed and the principality was abolished. Prince Niko Dadiani officially renounced his rights to the throne in 1868.\n\n\n\n"}

It is considered to be the standard reference work in the field of Islamic studies. The first edition was published in 1913–1938, the second in 1954–2005, and the third was begun in 2007.\n\nAccording to Brill, the \"EI\" includes \"articles on distinguished Muslims of every age and land, on tribes and dynasties, on the crafts and sciences, on political and religious institutions, on the geography, ethnography, flora and fauna of the various countries and on the history, topography and monuments of the major towns and cities. In its geographical and historical scope it encompasses the old Arabo-Islamic empire, the Islamic countries of Iran, Central Asia, the Indian sub-continent and Indonesia, the Ottoman Empire and all other Islamic countries\".\n\n\"EI\" is considered to be the standard reference work in the field of Islamic studies. Each article was written by a recognized specialist on the relevant topic. However, unsurprisingly for a work spanning 40 years until completion, not every one of them reflects recent research.\n\nThis reference work is of fundamental importance on topics dealing with the geography, ethnography and biography of Muslim peoples.\n\nThe first edition (\"EI1\") was modeled on the Pauly-Wissowa \"Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World\". \"EI1\" was created under the aegis of the International Union of Academies, and coordinated by Leiden University. It was published by Brill in four volumes plus supplement from 1913 to 1938 in English, German, and French editions.\n\nAn abridged version was published in 1953 as the \"Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam\" (\"SEI\"), covering mainly law and religion. Excerpts of the \"SEI\" have been translated and published in Turkish, Arabic, and Urdu.\n\nThe second edition of \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\" (\"EI2\") was begun in 1954 and completed in 2005 (several indexes to be published until 2007); it is published by the Dutch academic publisher Brill and is available in English and French. Since 1999, (\"EI2\") has been available in electronic form, in both CD-ROM and web-accessible versions. Besides a great expansion in content, the second edition of \"EI\" differs from the first mainly in incorporating the work of scholars of Muslim and Middle Eastern background among its many hundreds of contributors:\n\nPublication of the Third Edition of \"EI\" (\"EI3\") started in 2007. It is available online, printed \"Parts\" appearing four times per year. The editorial team consists of twenty 'Sectional Editors' and five 'Executive Editors' (i.e. editors-in-chief). The Executive Editors are Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer (Free University, Berlin), Everett Rowson (New York University), John Nawas (Catholic University of Leuven), and Denis Matringe (EHESS, CNRS). The scope of \"EI3\" includes comprehensive coverage of Islam in the twentieth century; expansion of geographical focus to include all areas where Islam has been or is a prominent or dominant aspect of society; attention to Muslim minorities all over the world; and full attention to social science as well as humanistic perspectives.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Urdu Encyclopaedia of Islam\" is the project of translating the Encyclopedia of Islam into Urdu.\nIt was started in the 1950s at University of the Punjab, as a project led by Muhammad Shafi. The editorial board worked on translating the Leiden \"Encyclopaedia\" into Urdu, amending, correcting, and adding to the Leiden text themselves.\nThe original plan for publication, as laid out by Shafi and others, was for the \"Encyclopaedia\" (which was to be entitled \"Urdu Da’ira Ma’arif-i-Islamiya\") to span between 20 and 22 volumes, with roughly a hundred illustrations per volume, published at a rate of four volumes per year.\nAt the time of Shafi's death in 1963, one volume of the encyclopaedia had been published (in February 1954), and a second volume was in press.\nBecause of Shafi's death, and lack of funding, work on the \"Encyclopaedia\" stalled until 1971, when a grant from the Asia Foundation enabled it to resume. Volumes 10 and 12 were completed by 1973.\nBy 1985, 21 out of a planned 25 volumes had been published.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1791212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791212", "title": "Josephine Butler", "text": "Josephine Butler\n\nJosephine Elizabeth Butler (' Grey; 13 April 1828 – 30 December 1906) was an English feminist and social reformer in the Victorian era. She campaigned for women's suffrage, the right of women to better education, the end of coverture in British law, the abolition of child prostitution, and an end to human trafficking of young women and children into European prostitution.\n\nGrey grew up in a well-to-do and politically connected progressive family which helped develop in her a strong social conscience and firmly held religious ideals. She married George Butler, an Anglican divine and schoolmaster, and the couple had four children, the last of whom, Eva, died falling from a banister. The death was a turning point for Butler, and she focused her feelings on helping others, starting with the inhabitants of a local workhouse. She began to campaign for women's rights in British law. In 1869 she became involved in the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases—particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy—through the forced medical examination of prostitutes, a process she described as surgical or steel rape. The campaign achieved its final success in 1886 with the repeal of the Acts. Butler also formed the International Abolitionist Federation, a Europe-wide organisation to combat similar systems on the continent.\n\nWhile investigating the effect of the Acts, Butler had been appalled that some of the prostitutes were as young as 12, and that there was a slave trade of young women and children from England to the continent for the purpose of prostitution. A campaign to combat the trafficking led to the removal from office of the head of the Belgian \"\", and the trial and imprisonment of his deputy and 12 brothel owners, who were all involved in the trade. Butler fought child prostitution with help from the campaigning editor of \"The Pall Mall Gazette\", William Thomas Stead, who purchased a 13-year-old girl from her mother for £5. The subsequent outcry led to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 which raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 and brought in measures to stop children becoming prostitutes. Her final campaign was in the late-1890s, against the Contagious Diseases Acts which continued to be implemented in the British Raj.\n\nButler wrote more than 90 books and pamphlets over the course of her career, most of which were in support of her campaigning, although she also produced biographies of her father, her husband and Catherine of Siena. Butler's Christian feminism is celebrated by the Church of England with a Lesser Festival, and by representations of her in the stained glass windows of Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral and St Olave's Church in the City of London. Her name appears on the Reformers Memorial in Kensal Green Cemetery, London, and Durham University named one of their colleges after her. Her campaign strategies changed the way feminist and suffragists conducted future struggles, and her work brought into the political milieu groups of people that had never been active before. After her death in 1906 the feminist leader Millicent Fawcett hailed her as \"the most distinguished Englishwoman of the nineteenth century\".\n\nJosephine Grey was born on 13 April 1828 at Milfield, Northumberland. She was the fourth daughter and seventh child of Hannah (\"\" Annett) and John Grey, a land agent and agricultural expert, who was a cousin of the reformist British Prime Minister, Lord Grey. In 1833 John was appointed manager of the Greenwich Hospital Estates in Dilston, near Corbridge, Northumberland, and the family moved to the area, where John acted as Lord Grey's chief political agent in Northumberland. In this role John promoted his cousin's political opinions locally, including support for Catholic emancipation, the abolition of slavery, the repeal of the Corn Laws and reform of the poor laws. Josephine was taught at home before completing her schooling at a boarding school in Newcastle upon Tyne which she attended for two years.\n\nJohn treated his children equally within the home. He educated them in politics and social issues and exposed them to various politically important visitors. John's political work and ideology had a strong influence on his daughter, as did the religious teaching she received from her mother; the family background and the circles in which she moved formed a strong social conscience and a staunch religious faith.\n\nAt about the age of 17 Grey went through a religious crisis, which probably stemmed from an incident in which she discovered the body of a suicide while out riding. She became disenchanted with her weekly church attendance, describing the local vicar as \"an honest man in the pulpit ... [who] taught us loyally all that he probably himself knew about God, but whose words did not even touch the fringe of my soul's deep discontent\". Following her crisis, Grey did not identify with any single strand of Christianity, and remained critical of the Anglican church. She later wrote that she \"imbibed from childhood the widest ideas of vital Christianity, only it \"was\" Christianity. I have not much sympathy with the \"Church\". She began to speak directly to God in her prayers:\n\nIn mid-1847 Grey visited her brother in County Laois, Ireland. It was at the height of the Great Famine and the first time she had come into contact with widespread suffering among the poor; she was deeply affected by her experiences and later recalled that \"As a young girl, I had no conception of the full meaning of the misery I saw around me, yet it printed itself upon my brain and memory.\"\n\nBy 1850 Grey had grown close to George Butler, a Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, whom she had met at several of the balls hosted around County Durham. By October that year George was sending her self-penned poems; the couple were engaged in January 1851 and married in January 1852. The Butlers set up home at 124, High Street, Oxford. George was a scholar and cleric and shared with his wife a commitment to liberal reforms and a love of Italian culture. The couple also both had a strong Christian belief and Josephine Butler later wrote of her husband that they often \"prayed together that a holy revolution might come about and that the Kingdom of God might be established on the earth\".\n\nIn November 1852 the Butlers had a son, George Grey Butler, followed by a second, Arthur Stanley—known as Stanley—in May 1854. Butler's later memories of Oxford were of a closeted and misogynist community lacking in family life; she was often the only female at social gatherings and would listen in anger to what her biographer Judith Walkowitz describes as \"the open acceptance of the double standard by the gentlemen of the university\". Butler was offended by a discussion regarding the publication in 1853 of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel \"Ruth\" in which the heroine is seduced by a man of means and subsequently abandoned. Butler saw that the male conversationalists considered it natural that a \"moral lapse in a woman was spoken of as an immensely worse thing than in a man\"; she decided not to voice her feelings on the point but \"to speak little with men, but much with God\". As a more practical measure she—and George—began to help many of the fallen woman of Oxford and invited some to live in their house. One case in which they were involved concerned a young woman serving a prison sentence at Newgate Prison. She had been seduced by a university don who had subsequently abandoned her; the woman had murdered her baby in despair. The Butlers contacted the governor of Newgate to arrange for her to stay in their house at the end of her sentence.\nIn 1856 Butler's health began to suffer from Oxford's damp atmosphere, which exacerbated a long-standing lesion on her lung; her doctor informed her that to remain in Oxford could be fatal. As an immediate step George purchased a house in Clifton, near Bristol, where their third son, Charles, was born in 1857. The same year, as a longer-term measure, George took the position of vice-principal at Cheltenham College and they moved to a local house. They continued their support for liberal causes, including that of the Italian nationalist Giuseppe Garibaldi, although their sympathy for the Union side in the American Civil War led to social ostracism; Butler considered that the resultant feeling of social isolation \"was often painful ... but the discipline was useful\".\n\nIn May 1859 Butler gave birth to her final child, a daughter, Evangeline Mary, known as Eva. In August 1864 Eva fell from the top-floor banister onto the stone floor of the hallway in her home; she died three hours later. Butler was distraught at the loss and had disturbed sleep for several years; she was unable to write about the circumstances until 30 years later. The subsequent inquest gave a verdict of accidental death.\n\nIn October 1864 Stanley contracted diphtheria while Butler was still grieving for Eva. She was suffering from depression and was in poor health. After the worst of Stanley's ailment passed, Butler decided to take him to Naples for them both to rest and recuperate. The ship in which they travelled down the west coast of Italy faced rough weather, and Butler had a physical breakdown on board from which she nearly died.\n\nIn January 1866 George was appointed headmaster of Liverpool College, and the family moved to premises in the Dingle area. Despite the new surroundings, Butler continued to mourn for Eva but focused her feelings on helping others; she later wrote that she \"became possessed with an irresistible urge to go forth and find some pain keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself. ... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool.\" She made regular visits to the workhouse at Brownlow Hill, an institution that could hold 5,000 individuals. She would sit with the women in the cellars—many of whom were prisoners—and pick oakum with them, while discussing the Bible or praying with them.\n\nJust as they had done in Cheltenham, the Butlers began providing shelter in their own home for some of the women, often prostitutes in the terminal stages of venereal disease. It soon became clear that there were more women in need than they could provide for, so Butler set up a hostel, with funds from local men of means. By Easter 1867 she had established a second, larger home, in which more appropriate work was provided, such as sewing and the manufacture of envelopes; the \"Industrial Home\", as she called it, was funded by the workhouse committee and local merchants.\n\nButler campaigned for women's rights, including the right to the vote and to have a better education. In 1866 she was a signatory on a petition to amend the Reform Bill to widen the franchise to include women. The petition, which was supported by the MP and philosopher John Stuart Mill, was ignored and the bill became law.\n\nButler considered the Liverpool hostels a stop-gap; women would continue to struggle to find employment until they had been better educated. In 1867, with the suffragist Anne Clough, she established the North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women, which aimed to raise the status of governesses and female teachers to that of a profession; She served as its president until 1873. A series of lectures, initially in towns in the north of England, began under James Stuart, a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Although it was thought thirty students would sign up, three hundred joined. In 1868 Butler published \"The Education and Employment of Women\", her first pamphlet, in which she argued for access to higher education for women, and more equal access to a wider range of jobs. It was the first of 90 books and pamphlets she wrote. That May she petitioned the senate of the University of Cambridge to provide examinations for women; the Cambridge Higher Examination for women was introduced the following year. Jordan notes that \"much of the credit for this should go to Anne Clough, but ... Butler played a very influential part ... of the campaign.\"\n\nAt the time British law relating to marriage was based on the legal doctrine of coverture, in which a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband upon their matrimony. By law a woman had no separate legal existence, and all her property became her husband's; divorce initiated by a woman was difficult and complicated. In April 1868 Butler and fellow suffragist Elizabeth Wolstenholme set up and became joint secretaries of the Married Women's Property Committee to pressure parliament into changing the law. Butler remained on the committee until the campaign was successful, with the passing into law of the Married Women's Property Act 1882.\n\nIn 1869 Butler became aware of the Contagious Diseases Acts. They had been introduced in 1864, 1866 and 1869 to regulate prostitution in an attempt to control the spread of venereal diseases, particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy. The Acts authorised the police to detain women in specific areas considered to be prostitutes—no evidence was needed, other than the police officer's word. If a magistrate agreed, women were given genital examinations. If women were suffering from sexually transmitted diseases, they were held in a lock hospital until the condition was cured. If they refused to be examined or hospitalised they could be imprisoned, often with hard labour.\n\nUnits of plain-clothed policemen specialised in arresting suspected prostitutes; according to Jordan, the officers were \"hated for their surveillance and harassment of prostitutes and working-class women ... who they treated with little regard for their legal rights\". Women who were subjected to the examination found their names and reputations affected and, according to the historian Hilary Cashman, \"the Acts had the effect of turning them to prostitution by barring respectable ways of life to them\".\n\nIn September 1869 Wolstenholme met Butler in Bristol to discuss what could be done about the Acts. The National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was founded that October, but excluded women from its membership. In response, Wolstenholme and Butler formed the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts (LNA) before the end of the year. The organisation published a \"Ladies Manifesto\", which stated that the Acts were discriminatory on grounds of both sex and class; the Acts, it was claimed:\n\nOn 31 December 1869 the Ladies National Association published a statement in \"The Daily News\" that it had \"been formed for the purposes of obtaining the repeal of these obnoxious Acts\". Among the 124 signatories were the social theorist Harriet Martineau and the social reformer Florence Nightingale.\n\nButler toured Britain in 1870, travelling 3,700 miles to attend 99 meetings in the course of the year. She focused her attention on working-class family men, the majority of whom were outraged at the description Butler gave of the examination women were forced to undergo; she called the process surgical or steel rape. Although she persuaded many members of her audiences, she faced significant opposition, which put her in danger. At one meeting pimps threw cow dung at her; at another, the windows of her hotel were smashed, while at a third, threats were made to burn down the building where she was hosting a meeting.\n\nAt the 1870 Colchester parliamentary by-election the LNA fielded a candidate against the Liberal Party candidate Sir Henry Storks, a supporter of the Acts, who had implemented a similar regime when he commanded the British army in Malta. Butler held several local meetings during the campaign; during one, she was chased by a group of brothel owners. The presence of the LNA candidate split the Liberal vote and allowed the Conservative Party candidate to win the seat; Butler considered that \"it proved to be somewhat of a turning-point in the history of our crusade\". Because of Stork's loss at the by-election the Home Secretary, Henry Bruce, announced a Royal Commission to examine the situation. One MP told Butler that\n\nThe commission began work in early January 1871 and spent six months taking evidence. After Butler testified on 18 March, a member of the committee, Liberal MP Peter Rylands, stated: \"I am not accustomed to religious phraseology, but I cannot give you an idea of the effect produced except by saying that the spirit of God was there\". Nevertheless, the commission's report defended the one-sided nature of the legislation, saying \"... there is no comparison to be made between prostitutes and the men who consort with them. With the one sex the offence is committed as a matter of gain; with the other it is an irregular indulgence of a natural impulse.\" The report accepted the findings that the sexual health of men in the 18 areas covered by the Acts had improved. In relation to the compulsory examinations, the commission was swayed by the descriptions of \"steel rape\", and suggested it should be voluntary not compulsory. The commission heard significant evidence that many prostitutes were as young as 12 and recommended that the age of consent should be raised from 12 to 14. Bruce took no action on the recommendations for six months.\n\nIn February 1872 Bruce proposed a bill that took some of the commission's recommendations, but widened the geographical scope from the 18 military centres to the whole of the UK. Although the LNA's initial stance was to accept some of the bill's clauses and try and change others, Butler rejected it in its entirety and published \"The New Era\", a 56-page pamphlet attacking the legislation; the pamphlet was re-published in serial form in \"The Shield\". It was the first split in the repeal movement and she lost many personal supporters because of her stance. The bill faced too much opposition from the parliamentary supporters of the Contagious Diseases Acts, and was withdrawn.\n\nTwo months after the withdrawal of Bruce's bill, a ministerial by-election in Pontefract in 1872 gave the LNA an opportunity for further action. Although they did not field a candidate, Butler attended meetings in the town. At one LNA meeting the floor of the room had been liberally sprinkled with cayenne pepper by her opponents, making speaking difficult. After it was cleared away, her opponents set bales of straw alight in a storeroom below, which led to smoke rising through the floorboards; two members of the Metropolitan Police—specially drafted into the town for the by-election—looked on but took no action. Although the incumbent Liberal candidate, Hugh Childers, was returned, there were heavy abstentions, and his vote was reduced by around 150 (from an electorate of 2,000). In December 1872 Butler met the Prime Minister, William Gladstone, when he visited Liverpool College. Although he supported the aims of the LNA, he was politically unable to back the LNA publicly, and had supported Bruce's bill.\n\nThe fall of the Liberal government in 1874, and its replacement with Benjamin Disraeli's Conservative administration meant that the repeal campaign stalled; Butler called it a \"year of discouragement\" when there was \"deep depression in the work\". Although the LNA kept up the pressure, progress in persuading Liberal MPs to oppose the Contagious Diseases Acts was slow, and the government was implacable in its support of the measures.\n\nAt a meeting of regional LNA branches in May, one speech focused on legislation in Europe; the meeting resolved to correspond with sister organisations on the continent. At the start of December 1874 Butler left for Paris and a tour that covered France, Italy and Switzerland, where she met with local pressure groups and civic authorities. She encountered strong support from feminist groups, but hostility from the authorities. She returned from her travels at the end of February 1875.\n\nAs a result of her experiences, in March 1875 Butler formed the British and Continental Federation for the Abolition of Prostitution (later renamed the International Abolitionist Federation), an organisation that campaigned against state regulation of prostitution and for \"the abolition of female slavery and the elevation of public morality among men\". The Liberal MP James Stansfeld—who wished to repeal the Acts—became the federation's first general secretary; Butler and her friend, the Liberal MP Henry Wilson, became joint secretaries.\n\nIn 1878 Josephine wrote a biography of Catherine of Siena, which Glen Petrie—her biographer—thought was probably her best work; Walkowitz considers the work provided a \"historical justification for her own political activism\". Another biographer, Helen Mathers, believes that \"in emphasising that she and Catherine were born to be leaders, of both men and women, ... [Butler] made a profound contribution to feminism\".\n\nButler became aware of the slave trade of young women and children from England to mainland Europe in 1879. Young girls were considered \"fair game\", according to Mathers, as the law allowed them to become prostitutes at the age of 13. After playing a minor role in starting an investigation into an accusation of trafficking, Butler became active in the campaign in May 1880, and wrote to \"The Shield\" that \"the official houses of prostitution in Brussels are crowded with English minor girls\", and that in one house \"there are immured little children, English girls of from twelve to fifteen years of age ... stolen, kidnapped, betrayed, got from English country villages by every artifice and sold to these human shambles\". She visited Brussels where she met the mayor and local councillors and made allegations against the head of the Belgian ' and his deputy as to their involvement in the trade. After the meeting she was contacted by a detective who confirmed that the senior members of the ' were guilty of collusion with brothel keepers. She returned home and filed a deposition containing a copy of the statement from the detective and sent them to the ' (Chief Prosecutor) and the British Home Secretary. Following an investigation in Belgium, the head of the ' was removed from office, and his deputy was put on trial alongside 12 brothel owners; all were imprisoned for their roles in the trade.\n\nThe 1880 general election had removed Disraeli's Conservative party from office; they were replaced by Gladstone's second ministry containing a high proportion of MPs who wanted to repeal the Acts. As Prime Minister, Gladstone had the power to nominate candidates to vacant positions within the Church and, in June 1882, he offered George Butler the position of canon of Winchester Cathedral. George had been considering retirement, but he and Josephine were concerned about their finances, as much of their income had been spent on the LNA and other causes Josephine supported. George accepted the appointment, and they moved into a grace and favour home near the cathedral. Josephine Butler set up another hostel for women near their home.\n\nPolitical pressure from Liberal backbenchers, particularly Joseph Chamberlain and Charles Hopwood, led to increasing opposition to the Acts. In February 1883 Hopwood tabled a resolution in parliament: \"That this House disapproves of the compulsory examination of women under the Contagious Diseases Acts\", which was debated in April. MPs voted by a majority of 72 to suspend the inspections; three years later the Acts were formally repealed.\n\nIn 1885 Butler met Florence Soper Booth, the daughter-in-law of William Booth, who founded the Salvation Army. The meeting led to Butler's involvement in the campaign to expose child prostitution in Britain and its associated trade. Along with Booth, Benjamin Scott the City Chamberlain and several supporters from the LNA, she persuaded the campaigning editor of \"The Pall Mall Gazette\", William Thomas Stead, to help their cause.\n\nStead considered the best way to prove that the purchase of young girls for prostitution took place in London, was to buy a girl himself. Butler introduced him to a former prostitute and brothel owner who was staying in her hostel. In a slum in Marylebone, Stead purchased a 13-year-old girl from her mother for £5, and took her to France. In July 1885 Stead began the publication of a series of articles entitled \"The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon\", exposing the extent of child prostitution in London. In the first article—which covered six pages of the \"Gazette\"—Stead recounted an interview he had with Howard Vincent, the head of the Criminal Investigation Department:\n\nOn 16 July—ten days after the article was published—Butler gave a speech at a meeting at London's Exeter Hall calling for increased protection for the young and the raising of the age of consent. The following day she and George left for a holiday in Switzerland and France. While they were away, a moribund parliamentary bill from 1883 dealing with the age of consent was re-debated by MPs; the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 was passed on 14 August 1885. The Act raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 years of age, while the procurement of girls for prostitution by administering drugs, intimidation or fraud was made a criminal offence, as was the abduction of a girl under 18 for purposes of carnal knowledge. The police investigated Stead's purchase, and Butler was forced to cut her holiday short to return for questioning. Although she avoided all charges, Stead was imprisoned for three months.\n\nThe passing of the Criminal Law Amendment Act led to the formation of purity societies, such as the White Cross Army, whose aims were to force the closure of brothels through prosecution. The societies widened their remit to suppress what they considered indecent literature—including information on birth control—and the entertainment provided by the music halls. Butler warned against the purity societies because of their \"fatuous belief that you can oblige human beings to be moral by force, and in so doing that you may in some way promote social purity\". Her warnings went unheeded by other suffragists, and some, such as Millicent Fawcett—who was later Butler's biographer—continued to combine their activities in the feminist movement with the work for the purity societies.\n\nAlthough the Contagious Diseases Acts had been repealed in the UK, the equivalent legislation was active in the British Raj in India, where prostitutes near the British cantonments were subjected to regular forced examinations. The relevant law was contained in the Special Cantonments Acts which had been put on to a practical footing by Major-General Edward Chapman, who issued standing orders for the inspection of prostitutes, and the provision of \"a sufficient number of women, to take care that they are sufficiently attractive, to provide them with proper houses\".\n\nButler began a new campaign to have the legislation repealed, comparing the girls to slaves. After the campaign put pressure on MPs, the widespread publication of Chapman's orders led to what Mathers describes as \"outrage across Britain\". In June 1888 the House of Commons passed a unanimous resolution repealing the legislation, and the Indian government was ordered to cancel the Acts. To circumvent the order, the India Office advised the Viceroy of India to instigate new legislation ensuring that prostitutes suspected of carrying contagious diseases had to undergo an examination or face expulsion from the cantonment.\n\nTowards the end of the 1880s George's health began to decline, and Butler spent increasing time looking after him. They holidayed in Naples in 1889, but George contracted influenza in the 1889–90 pandemic. They returned to Britain but George died on 14 March 1890; Butler suspended campaigning in the aftermath of his death. Soon after, she left Winchester, and moved to a house in Wimbledon, London, which she shared with her eldest son and his wife.\n\nButler, at 62, felt she was too old to travel to India, but two American supporters visited on her behalf and spent four months building a dossier showing that the lock hospitals, compulsory examination and use of underage prostitutes—some as young as 11—were all continuing to operate. The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Butler spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India.\n\nAlthough many of Butler's friends and supporters of shared causes spoke out against British Imperial Policy, Butler did not. She wrote that because of the work Britain had undertaken in making slavery illegal, \"[w]ith all her faults, looked at from God's point of view, England is the best, and the \"least\" guilty of the nations\". During the Second Boer War (1899–1902), Butler published \"Native Races and the War\" (1900), in which she supported British action and its imperialist policy. In the book she took a strong line against the casual racism inherent in her countrymen's dealings with foreigners, writing:\n\nFrom 1901 Butler began to withdraw from public life, resigning her positions in the campaign organisations and spending more time with her family. In 1903 she moved to Wooler in Northumberland, to live near her eldest son. On 30 December 1906 she died at home and was buried in the nearby village of Kirknewton.\n\nIn 1907 Josephine Butler's name was added to the south side of the Reformers' Memorial in Kensal Green Cemetery, London. The memorial was erected for those \"who had defied custom and interest for the sake of conscience and public good\". She is celebrated in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 30 May, and represented in a stained glass window in Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral, All Saints' Church, Cambridge and St Olave's Church in the City of London.\n\nHer connections to Liverpool were memorialised in a more secular fashion. A building in the Faculty of Business and Law at Liverpool John Moores University was named \"Josephine Butler House\". The building, originally the first Radium Institute in the UK, in the Cultural Quarter in Hope Street, was built in 1867 and demolished in 2013 when the site became a car park and subsequently student housing which opened in 2015.\n\nIn 1915 the LNA merged with the International Abolitionist Federation to form the Association of Moral and Social Hygiene, which changed its name to the Josephine Butler Society in 1953. As at 2017 the society still operates; it campaigns for the protection of prostitutes and provides \"protection for women and children who are criminally detained, violently abused or exploited by others who profit from their prostitution\".\n\nIn 2005 Durham University named Josephine Butler College after her, reflecting her and George's connection to the area and the university. The Women's Library, at the London School of Economics, holds a number of collections related to Butler. They include papers from the Ladies' National Association; more than 2,500 letters in the Josephine Butler Letter Collection; and the Josephine Butler Society Library consisting of books and pamphlets collected by the society. In 2001 English Heritage placed a blue plaque on her former residence in Wimbledon; her former house in Cheltenham was demolished in the 1970s, but in 2002 the Cheltenham Civic Society placed a plaque on the building which now occupies the site.\n\nButler was not only a staunch feminist but a passionate Christian, whose favourite phrase was \"God and one woman make a majority\". Although staunchly liberal, she felt constant tensions between her liberal and feminist philosophies. According to the feminist historian Barbara Caine, \"Liberalism provided the framework for Butler's whole social and political approach. It was an integral part of her feminism\", although it was in conflict with the liberal approach to sexuality and desire. Butler resolved the conflict through her religion.\n\nAccording to Walkowitz, Butler \"pushed liberal feminism in new directions, developing theories and methods of political agitation that directly affected future campaigns for the emancipation of women\". She developed new approaches to campaigning and moved the debate beyond discussions in middle-class houses to the public forum, bringing into the political debate women who had never been involved before. Butler's campaigning, says Walkowitz, \"not only reshaped gender, class, and sexual subjectivities in late Victorian Britain but also informed national political history and state-building\".\n\nNumerous historians consider the success of the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts to be a milestone in the history of female emancipation. According to the political historian Margaret Hamilton, the campaign showed that \"attitudes toward women were changing\". The feminist scholar Sheila Jeffreys says that Butler is \"one of the bravest and most imaginative feminists in history\", while Fawcett wrote that she was \"convinced that ... [Butler] should take the rank of the most distinguished Englishwoman of the nineteenth century\". Her unnamed obituarist in \"The Daily News\" considered that Butler's name\n\n\n"}

Licensed to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States, the station is run by students of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The station is owned by Student Educational Broadcasting, Inc. The station operates with an effective radiated power of 1,100 watts from an antenna height above average terrain of 147 meters.\n\nThe station broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Its signal has been simulcast on the Internet by ibiblio since November 1994 and is credited as having performed the first Internet radio broadcast in the world. It can also be found on iTunes, where, based on listener feedback, it would appear to enjoy some popularity in the UK and the American Northeast among Internet listeners.\n\nThe station is known for an eclectic variety of content, including: jazz, blues, rock, hip hop, zydeco, metal, electronic music, folk music, bluegrass, country, traditional Asian music, traditional African music, calypso, samba, tejano, mariachi, Latin American music, funk, electroclash, synthpop, pop, cajun, doo wop, reggae, dance hall, classical, classic rock, and almost any other type of music. \n\nThere is a stated emphasis on music from the 20th century onwards (as opposed to classical), though classical music is played from time to time. Furthermore, there is a conscious attempt to give artists from North Carolina (especially the greater Chapel Hill area) more air time, but local artists do not dominate the content. There are also specialty talk shows that highlight sports, news, and student government at UNC. Specialty music shows exhibit material from UNC's Southern Folklife Collection, music usually considered too erratic, abrasive, or long for regular radio play (even by WXYC's permissive standards), local music, newly released music, and electronic/dance. Additionally, every Thursday night there is a three-hour theme show. The theme of this show changes every week, but a few examples include: songs about chickens, music from Mexico, Swing music from occupied Europe, the northern England electronic scene, batucada, music performed by convicted criminals, and Carolina Soul of the 1960s through 1980s.\n\nWXYC's offices and studios are located in the Frank Porter Graham Student Union on the campus of the University of North Carolina. WXYC's transmitter is located on Jones Ferry Road in Chatham County, North Carolina. \n\nWXYC is known for putting on dances throughout the year with various themes, including the 80s, the early 1990s, and the best music released in the past year.\n\nPrior to 1977, WXYC was a carrier current AM station known as WCAR.\n\nUntil 1970, several UNC residence colleges had their own carrier current stations. Morrison Dormitory had WMO, Ehringhaus had WSTD, Granville Towers had WILD and Hinton James also had its own station. In the fall of 1969, Hinton James joined Ehringhaus to form WRSC (Radio South Campus). Meanwhile, Morrison and Granville Towers formed WCAR which broadcast from the basement of Granville West. In January of 1970, all of these stations consolidated into WCAR. The WCAR studios were located in the basement of Ehringhaus Dormitory and broadcast to every other dorm via AM frequency 550 kHz. The management of WCAR planned to upgrade the service with the hope of eventually getting an FM license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). At that time, it was anticipated that the station would serve as a training ground for future broadcasters and not act solely an outlet for, what was called at the time, \"progressive rock\".\n\nIn order to achieve their ambitious plans, many WCAR staff members ran for Student Legislature (SL). In 1972, a running joke around campus was that the SL was made up of three parties, the liberals, the conservatives, and WCAR. Through the shrewd use of political power, WCAR was allocated the funds necessary to move its studios and offices to the Frank Porter Graham Student Union in 1973. UNC students Jim Srebro, Gary Rendsburg, Jim Bond, Bob Heymann, Randy Wolfe, Monte Plott, and George Frye were all instrumental in the upgrading of facilities and doing the preliminary engineering and legal work in order to be licensed as an FM station. A student referendum was held in 1973 to allocate the necessary funds to formally apply for and build an FM station. Through the work of WCAR volunteers, the referendum passed.\n\nIn 1974, WCAR received its construction permit from the FCC to begin building its FM station. When the UNC Administration realized that this \"new\" FM station would be licensed with over 10,000 watts of power and therefore could be clearly heard in Raleigh and by members of the North Carolina General Assembly, it pulled its support for the entire project. The FCC subsequently canceled the construction permit.\n\nIn response, WCAR's management formed a not-for-profit corporation, Student Educational Broadcasting, Inc., which would become the new licensee of WXYC. Jim Srebro served as the first Chairman of Student Educational Broadcasting, Inc. In the intervening time, however, other new FM stations were licensed by the FCC in North Carolina which limited WXYC to only 400 watts of power when it went on the air in March 1977. In 2009 the station relocated its transmitter facilities and increased power to 1,100 watts.\n\nIn 1994 WXYC disc jockey Michael Shoffner set up the station's Internet radio broadcast, which runs to this day and is widely considered to be the first such broadcast.\n\nNorth Carolina Public Radio (WUNC) is also affiliated with the university.\n\n\n"}

Construction of the new road started in the Spring of 2005 and it was opened on 23 May 2007.\n\nThe scheme consists of a single two-lane carriageway, one roundabout and three traffic signal controlled junctions. of new road was constructed and a long, five-span, downstream bridge was built across the River Taw. A new roundabout was created between the Newport and Roundswell roundabouts: this has a feeder lane which provides easy access from the A39 Atlantic Highway to the A361 Braunton Road which generates much of Barnstaple's traffic.\n\nThe bridge is a balanced cantilever design with reinforced concrete box girders supporting the arms.\n\nOther constructions include stream culverts, two pedestrian/cycleway underpasses, minor retaining walls, and a 100-metre three span viaduct providing access for buses, cyclists and pedestrians to Barnstaple railway station. The plans allowed for reopening of the Barnstaple-Bideford railway, should this become financially viable.\n\nAs with any project of this scale, many companies were employed in the development. Edmund Nuttall Ltd., a major civil engineering group, was the main contractor. It was estimated to cost £42 million. £38 million of this amount came from the central government. Devon County Council also contributed.\n\nAn economic impact study estimated that after 5 years the project would generate an extra £248 million in business turnover and would create 1,280 jobs.\n\nUp to 20,000 people were expected to attend the Taw Bridge Family Fun Day.\n\nThe event was organised to raise money for charity and to commemorate the completion of the Western Bypass and Downstream Bridge.\n\nThe ceremony took place on the Pottington side of the bridge at 11:00 and members of the public were able to walk over the new bridge from 11:30. A Fun Run started from Park School at 12:00.\n\nAt 14:30 A tug-of-war competition took place on the bridge itself .\n\nA final grand parade was to start at 16:00 and at 17:30 an evening concert in St Peter's Church was to end the day.\nCritics said that the Western Bypass would endanger wildlife and the environment. Friends of the Earth campaigner and Green Party candidate Anthony Bown claimed it would disturb large numbers of seabirds on the Taw and Torridge Estuary, along with the habitat of endangered otters.\n\nThey are also worried that the bypass will attract more vehicles and therefore further contribute to pollution, but it has also been argued that the bypass will reduce pollution by substantially reducing traffic jams and journey times in and around Barnstaple.\n\nSome locals are also upset that the decoration chosen for one of the new roundabouts comprises Cornish stone, as the road is really a gateway to North Devon.\nThe old railway line from Barnstaple to Bideford was partially built over, meaning it will be more expensive to re-open the line in the future.\n\n"}

Based on the Torino, the mid-size two-door coupe was intended to be a less expensive Thunderbird alternative to compete with the increasingly popular intermediate personal luxury class of vehicles such as the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, Buick Regal, Dodge Charger and Chrysler Cordoba. It was essentially the concurrent Mercury Cougar XR-7 with a mild front end restyling to resemble the Thunderbird, different taillamps with a center reflector, unique twin opera windows and large color-keyed vinyl moldings placed higher on the bodysides. The interiors were identical save for upholstery styles and minor trim. \n\nIntroduced February 18th, 1974 as the Gran Torino Elite, it was initially the top of the line model of the Torino series. Although advertised separately, it was titled and registered as a Gran Torino. For 1975 and 1976, the Gran Torino prefix was dropped and Elite became a stand-alone model nameplate. Early pre-production publicity photos for the 1974 model show the use of \"Gran Torino XL\" nameplates.\n\nThe Elite name was dropped after 1976 because the Ford mid-size range was restructured for the 1977 model year. The Thunderbird was dramatically reduced in size and price for 1977 by moving the nameplate to the Torino-based LTD II platform which replaced the Torino. In effect, the Elite continued restyled and marketed under the more-recognized Thunderbird name, and the previous full-sized Thunderbird was discontinued.\n\n\n\nThe Elite name was also used in Mexico. The Ford Fairmont was introduced in Mexico in late 1977 as a 1978 model, replacing the Ford Maverick that was produced there locally. The Futura coupe with its distinctive Thunderbird-styled roofline was never offered in Mexico. Instead there was an uplevel 2-door sedan called the Fairmont Elite. It was distinguished from other Fairmonts by its higher level of equipment and vinyl roof. It used the four headlight grille from the Fairmont Futura along with Mercury Zephyr taillamps and rear quarter window louvers. For 1981, the Fairmont Elite switched to the Mercury Zephyr grille. \n\nFor 1982, the Fairmont Elite was renamed Ford Elite II, which was now offered in two- and four-door sedans. It continued to use the body of the Fairmont with the front end of the North American 1982\nFord Granada and matching rear bumper. The rear continued to use Mercury Zephyr taillamps. \n\nFrom 1983 to 1985, a version of the North American Fox platform Ford LTD was manufactured in Venezuela and marketed as the Ford Granada Elite in uplevel trim.\n\n"}

He scored numerous hit songs across the 1970s and 1980s, first as a member of the Raspberries (who had a million-selling single with \"Go All the Way\"), and then with his solo career, including hits such as \"All by Myself\", \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\", \"She Did It\", \"Hungry Eyes\", and \"Make Me Lose Control\".\n\nFrom a family of Russian Jewish immigrants, Carmen was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and grew up in Lyndhurst, Ohio. He has been involved with music since early childhood. By the age of two, he was entertaining his parents with impressions of Jimmy Durante and Johnnie Ray. By age three, he was in the Dalcroze Eurhythmics program at the Cleveland Institute of Music. At six years old, he took violin lessons from Muriel Carmen (his aunt), a violinist of the Cleveland Orchestra. By age 11, he was playing piano and dreaming about writing his own songs. The arrival of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones altered his dream slightly. By the time he was a sophomore at Charles F. Brush High School, Carmen was playing piano and singing in rock 'n' roll bands including the Fugitives, the Harlequins, the Sounds of Silence and the Cyrus Erie.\n\nThough classically trained in piano, Carmen became a self-taught guitarist. At 15, he started guitar lessons, but when his teacher's approach did not fit with what he wanted, he decided to teach himself. He bought a Beatles chord book and studied guitar for the next four months.\n\nCarmen became serious about being a musician while attending John Carroll University. He joined a band named Cyrus Erie, which recorded several unsuccessful singles for Epic records. Cyrus Erie guitarist Wally Bryson had been playing with friends Jim Bonfanti and Dave Smalley in one of Cleveland's most popular bands, the Choir, which scored a minor national hit in 1967 with the single \"It's Cold Outside\".\n\nWhen Cyrus Erie and the Choir collapsed at the end of the 1960s, Carmen, Bryson, Bonfanti and Smalley teamed up to form Raspberries, a rock and roll band who were among the chief exponents of the early seventies power pop style. Carmen was the lead singer of the group, and wrote or co-wrote all their hit songs. In 1975, after the breakup of Raspberries, he started his solo career, de-emphasizing harder rock elements in favor of soft rock and power ballads, which were already the hallmark of Carmen tracks on Raspberries albums.\n\nIn 2004, Carmen, along with original Raspberries members Jim Bonfanti, Wally Bryson, and Dave Smalley, re-formed the band for a series of sold-out live performances in cities across the United States. On that tour, the Raspberries recorded a live album of their hits at The House of Blues on Sunset Strip, in Hollywood. Both the show and album received critical acclaim. Carmen himself has stated that he planned to write new harder-edged songs for the band to perform in the same vein as those that the Raspberries performed in the 1970s.\n\nHis first two solo singles were chart hits in 1976. Both were built around themes by Sergei Rachmaninoff. The first of these singles, \"All by Myself\" – based on Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 – hit number 2 in the United States, and number 12 in the United Kingdom where it was his only charting hit. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in April 1976. The follow-up single, \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\" – based on the main theme of the slow movement of Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2 – reached number 11 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and hit number one on the US Adult Contemporary Chart, as well as number nine on the Cash Box chart. In the UK Dana took it to number 31. Those songs featured on his 1975 self-titled debut album, along with \"That's Rock and Roll\", a number 3 hit single for singer Shaun Cassidy. The album made number 21 on the \"Billboard\" album chart and was certified Gold in 1977 for sales of more than 500,000 copies.\n\nCarmen's second album, \"Boats Against the Current\", came out in the summer of 1977 and received mixed reviews. It featured backup players such as Burton Cummings, Andrew Gold, Bruce Johnston and Nigel Olsson. The album spent 13 weeks in the Billboard Album chart, peaking number 45. It also produced the Top 20 single \"She Did It,\" but the title track only managed to scrape the bottom of the chart. The title track was later covered by Olivia Newton-John on her album \"Totally Hot\". A third single taken from the album, \"Marathon Man,\" became his first solo single not to hit the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. However, Shaun Cassidy again made the Top 10 in 1978 with Carmen's \"Hey Deanie.\" For several weeks in the fall of 1977, Carmen had three compositions charting concurrently on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, Cassidy's two big hits and Carmen's own \"She Did It.\"\n\nCarmen followed up with two more albums. Despite declining chart fortunes, the single \"Change of Heart\" broke into the Pop Top 20 and reached number 6 at AC in late 1978, with this hit also being covered by Samantha Sang on her \"Emotion\" LP. But in 1980, after the release of the album \"Tonight You're Mine\" and single \"It Hurts Too Much\" (number 75 Billboard Top 100; number 3 South Africa, June 1980) he temporarily withdrew from the music industry.\n\nFour years later, after Mike Reno and Ann Wilson topped the charts (Pop number 7; Adult Contemporary number one) with the Carmen-penned ballad \"Almost Paradise\" (the love theme to the film \"Footloose\"), Eric resurfaced on Geffen Records in 1985 with a second self-titled album and a sizeable comeback hit \"I Wanna Hear It from Your Lips\". The single hit the Adult Contemporary Top 10 as well as the Pop Top 40. The follow-up single, \"I'm Through with Love,\" also climbed the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and reached the Top 20 of the Adult Contemporary chart. Another track from the album, \"Maybe My Baby,\" later became a Country hit for Louise Mandrell. \"I Wanna Hear It from Your Lips\" was also a Country hit for Louise Mandrell.\n\nIn 1987, Carmen's contribution to the hit movie \"Dirty Dancing\", \"Hungry Eyes\", hit number 2 on the Adult Contemporary Chart and also returned him to the Pop Top 10. \"Reason To Try\", a further contribution to the \"\" compilation album of songs recorded for the Seoul Summer Olympics, kept Carmen's profile high in 1988, during which the nostalgic \"Make Me Lose Control\" also returned him to the number one position on the Adult Contemporary chart – where it stayed for three straight weeks – as well as number 3 on Billboard's Hot 100. This became his highest charting song since \"All By Myself\". Both, along with \"Hungry Eyes\", having in the past two decades become classic pop radio favorites. Although Carmen did not follow his two hit singles with a new studio album in 1988, \"Make Me Lose Control\" was included on a revised 'Best Of' collection from Arista. (The original version of the album was released a few months before the single was released, and early pressings exclude the song.)\n\nThe year 2000 saw the stateside release of \"I Was Born to Love You\", which had been released in 1998 only in Japan as \"Winter Dreams\". Carmen eschewed the use of a band on the recording, playing most of the instruments and programming the drum parts himself. The album did not find a large audience, but Carmen has continued to enjoy success placing songs with other artists over the years. In 2000 he also toured for the first time in years with Ringo Starr and His All Starr Band performing \"Hungry Eyes\", \"Go All The Way\" and \"All By Myself\".\n\nOn December 24, 2013, the first new recording in over 15 years by Carmen titled \"Brand New Year\" was released. The track, written and recorded in November/December 2013 in Ohio and Los Angeles, was issued via a gratis download by Legacy Recordings as a special \"Christmas gift\", to herald the March 2014 arrival of a 30 track career retrospective entitled \"The Essential Eric Carmen.\".\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Eric Carmen among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\nCarmen has not toured since 2009, but continues to write and license music. He moved from Los Angeles back to Gates Mills in northeast Ohio in the 1990s. In 2016, Eric married former Los Angeles newscaster Amy Murphy and tweeted from his verified Twitter account on October 20, 2016 that he had gotten married in the previous week to his \"best friend and soulmate\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1791248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791248", "title": "Hirohiko Araki", "text": "Hirohiko Araki\n\nAraki grew up in Sendai, Japan with his parents and younger identical twin sisters. He cites his sisters' annoyances as the reason he spent time alone in his room reading manga, naming \"Ai to Makoto\" as the most important one to him, and his father's art books, he supposes this was his motive for drawing manga. He was particularly influenced by the work of French artist Paul Gauguin. After a school friend praised his manga, he began secretly drawing manga behind his parent's backs. He submitted his first work to a magazine in his first year of high school. All his submissions were rejected while other artists his age or younger were making successful debuts. He decided to go to the publishers' offices in Tokyo to find out why in person, taking a manga he stayed up all-night to finish. The Shueisha editor he met highly criticized the work, but said it had potential and to clean it up for the upcoming Tezuka Awards. The manga was \"Poker Under Arms\".\n\nAraki left Miyagi University of Education before graduating, and made his debut under the name in 1980 with the wild west one-shot \"Poker Under Arms\", which was a \"Selected Work\" at that year's Tezuka Award. His first serialization was \"Cool Shock B.T.\" in 1983, about a young magician who solves mysteries. But the first series to display his signature amount of gore was 1984's \"Baoh\". It tells the story of a man who is implanted with a parasite by an evil organization, giving him superhuman powers, and follows as he fights against them. It was adapted into an OVA in 1989, the manga was released in the US by Viz Media in 1990 (in \"tankōbon\" form in 1995), but the OVA didn't get a stateside release until 2002. It wasn't until \"The Gorgeous Irene\" in 1985, that he really developed his signature art style of buff, muscular characters (it would later become more flamboyant).\n\nHis next series would become his magnum opus, 1987's \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\". The series begins in 1880s England and follows Jonathan Joestar (JoJo) and his adopted brother Dio Brando, who eventually tries to kill their father in order to obtain his share of inheritance. When confronted, Dio puts on an ancient mask that turns him into a vampire. JoJo then learns a breathing technique called \"hamon\", and travels to Dio's castle to kill him. Subsequent arcs of \"JoJo\" follow the descendants of the Joestar family, and many are set in different parts of the world. Part 3, which would become the most popular part in the series, downplays the vampire story and hamon technique and instead introduces the power of Stands, which continues in the series today. Still being serialized over 30 years later, \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\" has been adapted into numerous other forms of media and the manga had 100 million collected volumes in print by December 2016. Since 2011, Araki has produced \"JoJolion\", the eighth story arc of the series, serialized in \"Ultra Jump\" magazine.\n\nThe September 2007 issue of \"Cell\" had a cover drawn by Araki with a ligase represented as one of his Stands. In 2008, Araki drew the cover art for a collection featuring Yasunari Kawabata's short story \"The Dancing Girl of Izu\". He drew the cover for the limited edition of Base Ball Bear's \"Breeeeze Girl\" single, which actually takes an image from the \"JoJo\" manga.\n\nAlso in 2009, Hirohiko Araki was one of five artists selected by the Musée du Louvre to create original works set at the famous museum. His piece \"Rohan at the Louvre\" starred JoJo's Rohan Kishibe and was shown at the exhibit titled Le Louvre invite la bande dessinée (\"The Louvre Invites Comic-Strip Art\"), which was created to show the diversity of comics, from January 19 to April 13.\n\"Rohan at the Louvre\" was highly praised. The following year, \"Rohan at the Louvre\" was published in France and ran in Japan's \"Ultra Jump\". It was released in the US by NBM Publishing in February 2012.\n\nFrom September 17 to October 6, 2011, the Gucci store in Shinjuku hosted the Gucci x Hirohiko Araki x Spur \"Rohan Kishibe Goes to Gucci\" Exhibition, a collaboration between the luxury Italian clothing brand, JoJo's creator and the fashion magazine \"Spur\". The exhibit celebrated the 90th anniversary of Gucci and featured a life-size figure of Rohan Kishibe, as well as numerous illustrations by Araki; including actual pieces of the brand's own 2011-2012 fall/winter collection and his own original fashion designs. For \"Spur\", Araki drew \"Kishibe Rohan meets Gucci.\", a full-color one-shot featuring Rohan Kishibe that ran in its October 2011 issue. \"Spur\" once again ran a \"JoJo\" spinoff by Araki, \"Jolyne, Fly High with Gucci\" starring Jolyne Cujoh from Part 6, in their February 2013 issue. A free English translation is available on Gucci's Facebook page.\n\nTo raise awareness of the ongoing reconstruction efforts of the Hiraizumi ruins, that were damaged by the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in June, Araki drew artwork depicting the ruins. A \"Hirohiko Araki JoJo Exhibition\" opened in Araki's native Sendai at the end of July 2012 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\", it then moved to Tokyo in October.\n\nHe drew the album cover for Sayuri Ishikawa's 2012 album \"X -Cross-\", where she performs one of the series' iconic poses and is drawn wearing jewelry from the manga, the cover of the 2012 reprint of Tamaki Saitō's \"Lacan for Surviving\", and the cover of the 2015 compilation album for composer Akira Senju.\n\nA book explaining Araki's methodology on creating manga, titled , was released on April 17, 2015 in Japan; an English translation was later released on June 6, 2017. A stage adaptation of Araki's 1994 one-shot \"Under Execution, Under Jailbreak\" ran from November 20 to November 29, 2015, at the Galaxy Theatre, then touring the country in December. The play also included elements of his 1996 one-shot \"Dolce, and His Master.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1791250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791250", "title": "Simpsons Bible Stories", "text": "Simpsons Bible Stories\n\n\"Simpsons Bible Stories\" is the eighteenth episode of \"The Simpsons\" tenth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on Easter Sunday, April 4, 1999. It is the first of \"The Simpsons\" now annual trilogy episodes, and consists of four self-contained segments. In the episode, the Simpson family fall asleep during a sermon in church. Marge dreams that she and Homer are Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, Lisa dreams that she and her fellow Springfield Elementary School students are Hebrew slaves in Ancient Egypt and guides Moses to lead them to freedom, Homer dreams that he is King Solomon called to resolve a dispute between Lenny and Carl over the ownership of a pie, and Bart dreams he is King David, who has to fight Goliath's son, Goliath II.\n\n\"Simpsons Bible Stories\" was written by Matt Selman, Larry Doyle and Tim Long, and was the first episode Nancy Kruse directed for \"The Simpsons\". While executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully stated that the idea for the episode came after Fox requested an Easter-themed episode, co-writer Selman argued that it was conceived by former staff writers Dan Greaney and Donick Cary while they were pitching ideas for the tenth season. Because the episode mostly takes place outside Springfield, the animators had to design completely new sets. While the episode mostly features references to the Old Testament and Christianity, it also parodies children's television programs, American politicians and action films by Jerry Bruckheimer.\n\nIn its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 12.2 million viewers, \n\nFollowing its broadcast, the episode received mixed reviews from critics, but won an Annie award in the category of Best Animated Television Production. \n\nIn 2007, the episode was released as part of \"The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD box set, and a promotional poster for the episode was included in an exhibition in Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The episode's ending scene is one of series creator Matt Groening's favorite moments on \"The Simpsons\". The episode has been credited with fostering a critical literacy towards religion and the Bible among its viewers.\n\nIt is an unseasonably hot Easter at church, and no one is interested in Reverend Lovejoy's sermons. When the collection plate is passed around, Homer puts in a chocolate Easter bunny that he found in the dumpster, enraging Reverend Lovejoy, calling it a wicked idol, and provoking him to read the Bible from the beginning. The Simpsons all fall asleep.\n\nMarge dreams that she and Homer are Adam and Eve. They peacefully live in the Garden of Eden until a snake (Snake Jailbird) tempts Adam into eating dozens of apples from the forbidden tree. He persuades Eve to try one when God (Ned Flanders) witnesses his sin. Even though Adam ate many apples, God only caught Eve eating an apple, and she is therefore banished from the Garden of Eden. Adam is unwilling to come clean, but misses Eve and thinks of a way of getting her back in by digging a tunnel with the help of some of the animals. God's unicorn, named Gary, becomes exhausted from the digging and dies just before God catches Adam trying to smuggle Eve back into the Garden. The death of the unicorn enrages him further, and he expels them both from the Garden of Eden.\n\nLisa imagines she and all the other Springfield Elementary students are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build a pyramid. Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if it is going to be smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.\n\nHomer pictures himself as King Solomon. Lenny and Carl fight over ownership of a pie. King Solomon cuts it in half, sentences Lenny and Carl to death, and then eats the pie. King Solomon then presides over a civil case between Jesus and Checker Chariot.\n\nBart sees himself as King David, who kills Goliath, but has not won the war yet: Nelson is Goliath II, Goliath's son. Goliath II has killed Methuselah (Grampa), David's oldest friend in revenge. In retaliation, David challenges Goliath II, but having no stones to sling at him, David loses and is catapulted from the city. David then meets Ralph, a shepherd, who claims he can kill Goliath II. Ralph dies, which enrages David even more. He then trains to try to slay Goliath. Having to climb up the enormous Tower of Babel beforehand, David manages to kill Goliath by throwing a lit lantern down his throat. Goliath is surprisingly still alive, but is quickly killed by Ralph's gravestone, hurled by Ralph himself, who also had not died. Much to his shock, David is sent to jail as the townspeople claim that Goliath was the best King they ever had, building roads, libraries and hospitals. The dream ends with a title card that reads \"A Bart Simpson Dream\".\n\nAs the family wakes up, they find themselves alone in the church. Upon exiting they realize that the Apocalypse has come; fire rains from a red sky, and the Four Horsemen ride past. The Flanders ascend into Heaven, but The Simpsons do not; Lisa begins to ascend, but Homer grabs her leg and pulls her back down. Instead, the Simpsons descend via a staircase into Hell, where Homer follows the delicious scent of barbecue. The episode ends with Homer screaming in agony (because there are no hot dogs and hamburgers, there is pineapple in the coleslaw, and German potato salad) as \"Highway to Hell\" by AC/DC plays over the credits.\n\n\"Simpsons Bible Stories\" was co-written by Matt Selman, Larry Doyle and Tim Long, and was the first episode Nancy Kruse directed for \"The Simpsons\". It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April 4, 1999, the day Easter took place that year. According to executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully, the idea for the episode was conceived when Fox requested an Easter-themed \"Simpsons\" episode that would air on the holiday. Normally, Fox would not broadcast any new \"Simpsons\" episodes on Easter, as it is considered a \"low-ratings night\", but \"Simpsons Bible Stories\" was an exception. However, according to co-writer Selman, the idea for the episode came about when he and former staff writer Dan Greaney were pitching episode ideas for the tenth season with former staff writer Donick Cary. Cary and Greaney suggested a \"bible-trilogy\" story, which then became \"Simpsons Bible Stories\". \"Simpsons Bible Stories\" is the first of the trilogy episodes which, since the season 12 episode \"Simpsons Tall Tales\", \"The Simpsons\" produces once every season.\n\nThe first segment was written by Long. According to former staff writer Tom Martin, Long wanted the pig in the garden of Eden to have a \"Tony British\" accent. The pig was voiced by regular cast member Hank Azaria, who portrays Moe Szyslak among other characters in the series. The unicorn that digs a hole from the garden of Eden was portrayed by Tress MacNeille. The second segment was written by Doyle. The episode's third segment was written by Selman. When writing segments for trilogy episodes, the writing staff usually follow the stories they are based on, while putting \"The Simpsons\" characters in the original characters' place. With \"Simpsons Bible Stories\"' third segment, Selman stated that he wanted to go a \"fresh new way\" by instead writing a sequel to the story of David and Goliath. According to Scully, Selman had a very clear vision of how he wanted the segment to be, and Selman said that he wanted to make a \"dog's breakfast\" of movie clichés at the time.\n\nThe song that plays during Bart's training montage is \"Winner Takes It All\" by American rock singer Sammy Hagar. Selman decided to include the song after hearing it in the 1987 action drama film \"Over the Top\". According to Doyle, the scene was originally much longer, almost seven minutes in length. The song that plays during the episode's end credits is \"Highway to Hell\" by Australian hard rock band AC/DC. According to Scully, the staff could not use the song on \"The Simpsons\" at first, since AC/DC's record company refused to sell it. However, when Scully called the band's manager directly, it turned out he had not been told about the request. Scully said that when they asked if they could use \"Highway to Hell\", the band's manager \"signed on right away\" and gave the \"Simpsons\" staff a \"huge discount.\"\n\nBecause most of the episode takes place in ancient history, the animators had to create completely new sets and designs for the episode. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Kruse stated that she and staff animator Alex Ruiz had to re-draw a majority of the episode, as the faulty scenes were drawn by six trainees. In order to receive an animator credit on \"The Simpsons\", an animator has to draw ten scenes in an episode. Because the trainees did not draw ten scenes each, none of them were credited for their work on the episode. All the trainees were later hired to \"The Simpsons\" animation staff. Kruse stated that, while animating the episode, she was worried that the animation department would be offended by the episode's content, as many of the crew members were \"very religious\". However, as animation ensued, she found that most of the animators were not uncomfortable with the episode, as it mostly parodies the Old Testament. The only complaint she received was from an animator who refused to animate Jesus in the court room scene in Homer's dream.\n\nIn the DVD commentary for the episode, Scully stated that he regretted not submitting \"Simpsons Bible Stories\" for the Primetime Emmy Award in the category of animated programming less than one hour in 1999. At the time, Scully reasoned that, because the original stories were not conceived by the writing staff, the episode would not hold up. However, he noted that the episode's animation was \"outstanding\", and that he later found out that the Emmy awards \"put a lot of importance on\" the animation in submitted episodes. Instead of submitting \"Simpsons Bible Stories\" for the Emmy awards in 1999, Scully submitted \"Viva Ned Flanders\", which ultimately lost to the \"King of the Hill\" episode \"And They Call It Bobby Love\".\n\n\"Simpsons Bible Stories\" contains several references to the Hebrew prophets, holy book, and the religion as a whole, as well as films based on the Bible. Each segment is based on a biblical story, mostly from the Old Testament. The first segment is based on the story of Adam and Eve, who, according to the Book of Genesis were the first man and woman created by God. Ned Flanders has the role of God, while the serpent that lures Marge into eating an apple from the forbidden tree resembles Snake Jailbird. The Garden of Eden was the place where Adam and Eve lived after they were created by God, according to the Book of Genesis.\nThe second segment parodies Moses who, according to the Book of Exodus, freed the Israelites from the Egyptian Pharaoh. Milhouse has the role of Moses while Skinner has the role of the Pharaoh. When the Pharaoh asked who vandalized his sarcophagus, the burning bush tells him that Bart did it. When Bart is seized by the Pharaoh's guards, he exclaims \"No, the bush set me up!\" Bart's line refers to the 1990 arrest of Marion Barry who, while being arrested by the FBI for smoking crack cocaine, exclaimed \"No, the bitch set me up!\" In a scene in the segment, Milhouse and Lisa can be seen pouring frogs into Skinner's tent. The scene refers to the second of ten Biblical plagues that were imposed on Egypt by God, in chapters 7-12 of the Book of Exodus. While they are inside the torture chamber, Milhouse and Lisa walk past an orb. The orb is called \"Orb of Isis\" and played a big part in the season 9 episode \"Lost Our Lisa\". In another scene, Milhouse parts the Red Sea so that his fellow slaves can escape. The execution of the scene is based on the one seen in the 1956 American epic film \"The Ten Commandments\", in which Moses parts the Red Sea. The shot in which Pharaoh and his guards are drowning is also taken from the movie.\n\nIn Homer's dream, Homer has the role of King Solomon who, according to the Books of Kings and Book of Chronicles was a King of Israel, as well as one of the 48 prophets according to the Talmud. Bart's dream shows Bart as King David and, rather than telling the story of David and Goliath, Bart's dream is a \"sequel\" to the story. The segment is inspired by and contains references to several films by Jerry Bruckheimer, including \"Die Hard\" and \"Lethal Weapon\", and borrows elements from other action films. At one point in the segment, Bart's dog Santa's Little Helper starts talking to him. The dog's voice is similar to that of Goliath in the stop-motion animated television series \"Davey and Goliath\". Inside the whale skeleton in the episode, Bart finds the remains of Jonah. Jonah was a prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel, according to the Hebrew Bible. Nelson lives in the Tower of Babel which, according to the Book of Genesis, was an enormous tower that the humans built in order to reach heaven. After being defeated by Bart, Nelson reappears while a variation of Modest Mussorgsky's composition \"St. John's Night on the Bare Mountain\" plays in the background. At the end of the segment, Bart is arrested and Chief Wiggum says \"Where's your messiah now?\" Wiggum's line was also taken from \"The Ten Commandments\", from a character played by Edward G. Robinson, on whom Wiggum's voice is based. King David's (Bart) training montage of arm-wrestling with his sheep is a reference to the film \"Over the Top\", complete with Sammy Hagar's \"Winner Takes It All\" from the film.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on April 4, 1999, \"Simpsons Bible Stories\" received a 7.4 Nielsen rating, translating to approximately 7.4 million viewers. The rating is based on the number of household televisions that were tuned into the show, but Nielsen Media Research estimated that 12.2 million viewers watched the episode, a considerable drop from the previous episode, which was seen by an estimated 15.5 million viewers. David Bianculli of \"New York Daily News\" attributed the loss in viewership to the fact that the episode aired on a religious holiday. Nevertheless, it was the week's second most watched program on the network. \n\nLater that year, the episode received an Annie award in the category of Best Animated Television Production, the second year in a row that \"The Simpsons\" won the award. \n\nOn August 7, 2007, \"Simpsons Bible Stories\" was released as part of \"The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD box set. Matt Groening, Mike Scully, George Meyer, Tom Martin, Larry Doyle, Matt Selman and Nancy Kruse participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode.\nFollowing its broadcast, \"Simpsons Bible Stories\" received mixed reviews from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\" wrote that the episode is \"A fantastic twist of the Treehouse of Horror style of storytelling,\" and added that each segment is a \"classic on its own\". They wrote that Wiggum telling Moses and Lisa to give his regards to the British Museum as he seals them inside a tomb and Marge asking Bart if he is wearing clean underwear as they face the apocalypse were some of the episode's \"best moments\", and concluded by writing that the episode is \"\"The Simpsons\" at its very best: inventive, irreverent and very, very funny.\" \n\nWhile DVD Town's James Plath wrote that the episode's premise was \"risky\", he still enjoyed the episode. \n\nAlan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz of \"The Star-Ledger\" described the episode as \"hilarious\", however they noted that the episode's \"suggestion that Moses parted the Red Sea by having all the Israelites flush their toilets at once\" could result in a backlash from the \"religious right\".\n\nOn the other hand, giving the episode a negative review, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that \"Simpsons Bible Stories\" \"proves less successful [than most Treehouse of Horror episodes]\". He added that he \"just think the brevity required by the inclusion of three separate tales better suits the world of horror spoofs than it does these Bible pieces,\" as they \"try to pack an awful lot into very little time.\" He concluded by writing that, while the episode has \"some good moments\", he did not find a lot of entertainment in it. \n\nAaron Roxby of Collider described \"Simpsons Bible Stories\" as his least-favorite trilogy episode, and wrote \"Considering that, in earlier seasons, the show had some of the most thoughtfully edgy religious humor on television, this one feels surprisingly toothless.\" However, he gave praise to the talking pig in the Garden of Eden.\n\nAt the end of the episode, the Simpsons walk out of the church and notice that the Apocalypse has begun. While the other family members are left on earth, Lisa at first starts ascending into Heaven, but Homer stops her by grabbing her leg and says \"Where do you think you're going, missy?\" The gag was written by staff writer George Meyer, and is series creator Matt Groening's favorite joke of the series. While the episode's ending is one of Groening's favorites, fans were uneasy with it. Selman stated that the ending \"drives them [the fans] crazy\", since they do not know whether or not the episode is canonical. \n\nIn 2007, Homer's line \"Oh, I smell barbeque!\" was included in Bobby Bryant of \"The State\"'s list \"20 Essential Things I've Learned From Homer Simpson\". \n\nThe same year, the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma, unveiled a new exhibit which galleried Biblical images in art and pop culture, including a promotional poster for \"Simpsons Bible Stories\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1791259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791259", "title": "Smart antenna", "text": "Smart antenna\n\nSmart antennas (also known as adaptive array antennas, digital antenna arrays, multiple antennas and, recently, MIMO) are antenna arrays with smart signal processing algorithms used to identify spatial signal signatures such as the direction of arrival (DOA) of the signal, and use them to calculate beamforming vectors which are used to track and locate the antenna beam on the mobile/target. Smart antennas should not be confused with reconfigurable antennas, which have similar capabilities but are single element antennas and not antenna arrays.\n\nSmart antenna techniques are used notably in acoustic signal processing, track and scan radar, radio astronomy and radio telescopes, and mostly in cellular systems like W-CDMA, UMTS, and LTE. \n\nSmart antennas have many functions: DOA estimation, beamforming, interference nulling, and constant modulus preservation..\n\nThe smart antenna system estimates the direction of arrival of the signal, using techniques such as MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification), estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) algorithms, Matrix Pencil method or one of their derivatives. They involve finding a spatial spectrum of the antenna/sensor array, and calculating the DOA from the peaks of this spectrum. These calculations are computationally intensive.\n\nMatrix Pencil is very efficient in case of real time systems, and under the correlated sources.\n\nBeamforming is the method used to create the radiation pattern of the antenna array by adding constructively the phases of the signals in the direction of the targets/mobiles desired, and nulling the pattern of the targets/mobiles that are undesired/interfering targets.\nThis can be done with a simple Finite Impulse Response (FIR) tapped delay line filter. The weights of the FIR filter may also be changed adaptively, and used to provide optimal beamforming, in the sense that it reduces the Minimum Mean Square Error between the desired and actual beampattern formed. Typical algorithms are the steepest descent, and Least Mean Squares algorithms. In digital antenna arrays with multi channels use the digital beamforming, usually by DFT or FFT.\n\nTwo of the main types of smart antennas include switched beam smart antennas and adaptive array smart antennas. Switched beam systems have several available fixed beam patterns. A decision is made as to which beam to access, at any given point in time, based upon the requirements of the system. Adaptive arrays allow the antenna to steer the beam to any direction of interest while simultaneously nulling interfering signals. Beamdirection can be estimated using the so-called direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation methods.\n\nIn 2008, the United States NTIA began a major effort to assist consumers in the purchase of digital television converter boxes. Through this effort, many people have been exposed to the concept of smart antennas for the first time. In the context of consumer electronics, a \"smart antenna\" is one that conforms to the EIA/CEA-909 Standard Interface.\n\nIn 2017, the Israeli Aerospace Industries unveiled an adaptive array antenna called ADA, and stated that it is already operational and shall be fitted onto \"major platforms\" used by the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nPrior to the final transition to ATSC digital television in the United States on June 11, 2009, two smart antenna models were brought to market:\n\n\nAnd two models are causing consumer confusion:\n\n\n\nSmart antenna systems are also a defining characteristic of MIMO systems , such as the IEEE 802.11n standard. Conventionally, a smart antenna is a unit of a wireless communication system and performs spatial signal processing with multiple antennas. Multiple antennas can be used at either the transmitter or receiver. Recently, the technology has been extended to use the multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver; such a system is called a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system . As extended Smart Antenna technology, MIMO supports spatial information processing, in the sense that conventional research on Smart Antennas has focused on how to provide a digital beamforming advantage by the use of spatial signal processing in wireless channels. Spatial information processing includes spatial information coding such as Spatial multiplexing and Diversity Coding, as well as beamforming.\n\n\n\nBooks:\n"}

She was nicknamed 'May' to distinguish her from her mother. May was of English ancestry. The Bolles family were distinguished in New York City, owning a successful bank in the city. When she was fourteen May was sent to England to live with her English cousins. For one year May lived in Kensington. May became very spiritually minded; she was given a gift of a Bible in 1885, which she studied and read daily.\n\nAs May approached her late teens, her family saw it was the time for her to be married. Phoebe Hearst, who was a close friend of her mother, funded May's extravagant debutante ball. She was 'brought out' in Washington. May was considered a great beauty with a petite figure, blue eyes and long fair hair attracting several suitors who courted her. The rejection of several marriage proposals frustrated her family. She was bought out again into Newport society in the hopes of finding a husband. May fell in love during this period and became engaged, but it was broken off. May plunged into depression, and it was around this time that her health seriously deteriorated.\n\nIn late 1894, May moved to Paris with her mother and brother; who was attending the École des Beaux-Arts. May's mother still hoped for her to marry, but May resented the Parisian high society. She went through periods of deep depression and insomnia and even considered entering a convent. In 1897 May lost both her grandmother and cousin whom she was very close to. At 27 May became obsessed with mortality and became bedridden leading to many of her family members believing she was going to die.\n\nIn November 1898, Phoebe Hearst, accompanied by her nieces and other Baháʼís like Lua Getsinger, stopped off at Paris before concluding their journey to the East. Hearst was shocked to see 28-year-old May bedridden with the chronic malady which had inflicted her. She invited May to sojourn to the East with her believing the change of air to be conducive to her health. Getsinger also disclosed to May the purpose of the journey; a pilgrimage to visit the head of the Baháʼí religion ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. May arrived in Acre in February 1899. She wrote of the first time she met ʻAbdu'l-Bahá as \"of that first meeting I can remember neither joy nor pain nor anything that I can name\".\n\nMay returned to Paris and began teaching her new faith and played a significant role in introducing the religion to several people while in Paris. She helped convert several new believers, including Englishman Thomas Breakwell and Juliet Thompson. On her return five of the younger female pilgrims had a photograph commissioned and sent to ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. On receiving the photograph he wrote a tablet addressed to the five, whom he named the \"Five Holy Leaves\". She met a close friend of her brother's, William Sutherland Maxwell, a Canadian of Scottish background, and the two married in 1902 in London. William had been introduced to the religion before their marriage but he did not become a Baháʼí until 1909, after meeting ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. The couple had one child, a daughter named Mary.\n\nThe couple moved to Montreal, and May set up a Baháʼí center in her home. Prior to 1912, she supported a Children's Court for Montreal, and her efforts were chief in maintaining the Colborne Street Milk Station. In about 1914, she brought a Montessori teacher from New York to their home in Montreal to start the first school of this type in Canada. In Montreal May continued to convert people such as Arthur Armstrong, Rose Henderson and her husband's cousin Martha MacBean. In 1912 ʻAbdu'l-Bahá visited Canada and stayed with the Maxwells. She was an early participant at Green Acre, the first Baháʼí training facility in the United States. In 1927 she was a member of the US and Canada National Spiritual Assembly.\n\nIn 1937, her life changed dramatically after her daughter, Mary, was married to Shoghi Effendi, then head of the Baháʼí Faith.\n\nDespite poor health, on January 24, 1940 May chose to leave New York on a steamship to Brazil, ultimately to land in Argentina to teach the Faith with her niece, Jeanne Bolles. She arrived in Buenos Aires on February 27 with elation; however on March 1, May died of a heart attack. Shoghi Effendi gave her the status of martyr and cabled the following: \"ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's beloved handmaid, distinguished disciple May Maxwell (is) gathered (into the) glory (of the) Abhá Kingdom. Her earthly life, so rich, eventful, incomparably blessed, (is) worthily ended. To sacred tie her signal services had forged, (the) priceless honor (of a) martyr's death (is) now added. (A) double crown deservedly won. (The) Seven-Year Plan, particularly (the) South American campaign, derive fresh impetus (from the) example (of) her glorious sacrifice.

The album \"Dusty in Memphis\" was released in stereo, though its singles were remixed and released in mono. \"Son of a Preacher Man\" was to be the last Top Ten chart hit for Springfield for almost 20 years, until she teamed up with Pet Shop Boys for the single \"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\" in 1987. In 1995 a re-release reached number one in Iceland.\n\nIn 1967, while working at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, songwriters John Hurley and Ronnie Wilkins (who had recently had a hit with \"Love of the Common People\") were asked by Jerry Wexler to write a song for Aretha Franklin. Recalling that Franklin's father was a gospel preacher, as was Wilkins's grandfather, they came up with \"Son of a Preacher Man\". Wexler liked the song, and recorded it with Franklin, though he later decided that it did not fit well with her other songs, and passed the song on to Dusty Springfield for her album \"Dusty in Memphis\".\n\nThe song was also recorded by Franklin's older sister, Erma, and included on her 1969 Brunswick album \"Soul Sister\". Not until after hearing Springfield's version did Aretha Franklin reconsider, ultimately including the song on her 1970 album, \"This Girl's in Love with You\"; this version charted only as the B-side of her hit single \"Call Me\".\n\nThe writers of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine placed Dusty Springfield's recording at number 77 among \"The 100 Best Singles of the Last 25 Years\" in 1987. The record was placed at number 43 among the \"Greatest Singles of All Time\", by the writers of \"New Musical Express\" in 2002, and\nin 2004, the song was on the \"Rolling Stone\" list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\n\nIn 1994, the song was featured in a scene of the film \"Pulp Fiction\". The film's soundtrack reached number 21 on the Billboard 200 and went platinum (100,000 units) in Canada alone. \"Son of a Preacher Man\" helped to sell over two million units of the album and to help it reach number six on the charts according to SoundScan. Quentin Tarantino has been quoted, on the \"Collectors Edition\" DVD of \"Pulp Fiction\", as saying that he probably would not have filmed the scene in which the song is featured had he not been able to use it.\n\nIn 2001, Emma Wilkinson's UK television performance of Son Of A Preacher Man won the Grand Final of the talent show Stars In Their Eyes garnering the most votes from 15 million television viewers. Wilkinson then released an album in 2002 featuring the song as its title track, mixed with original songs of her own and other Dusty cover versions.\n\nThe song is also featured in the film \"\", during scenes depicting Kenneth Lay, ex-Enron CEO and son of a Baptist minister, and on an episode of \"Hindsight\". In the 2008 television episode of the American series \"The Office\" titled \"Baby Shower\", Jan Levinson, played by Melora Hardin, is filmed singing \"Son of a Preacher Man\" as a lullaby to her newborn daughter Astrid. Later in the same episode, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) describes the bizarre scene to his fiancée, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), saying that the song is about \"losing your virginity next to a church.\"\n\nSamples from \"Son of a Preacher Man\" were used on Cypress Hill's \"Hits from the Bong\" on their album \"Black Sunday\". The song is also featured in the 2016 video game \"Mafia III\".\n\n\n\n"}

It was a part of the U.S. Pacific Ocean Areas under Admiral Chester Nimitz.\n\nThe assignment orders for Major General Ernest Harmon as the Commanding General, Army Forces, South Pacific, dated 7 July 1942, said:\n\n\"The establishment of the Pacific Ocean Area as an area of United States strategical responsibility under the command of the Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, became effective on May 8, 1942. The Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, has been designated the \"Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Ocean Area\". Under the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Ocean Area, a U.S. Naval officer has been designated as \"Commander, South Pacific Area\". The South Pacific Force under COMSOPAC include the following:\n\nIn July 1942 the South Pacific Area, under Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, superseded by Admiral William Halsey Jr. from 16 October, comprised four commands: Amphibious Forces, South Pacific (AmphibForSoPac), under Admiral Richmond K. Turner, South Pacific Naval Forces under Admiral Ghormley, U.S. Army Forces South Pacific under Major General Millard Harmon, and South Pacific Air Forces under Admiral John S. McCain, Sr.. At a later stage Transport Group, South Pacific (TransGrpSoPac) was added to the organisation.\n\nThe organisation's first major battle was the Battle of Guadalcanal. Admiral Ghormley's Operations Order 1-42 established two task forces, Task Force 61 and Task Force 63, to carry out the operation.\n\nOn September 20, 1942, six weeks after the first American amphibious operation of the war got underway at Guadalcanal, Vice Admiral Aubrey Fitch assumed command of Aircraft, South Pacific Force (AirSoPac). Not a desk-bound admiral, he carried out numerous, hazardous flights into the combat zones, inspecting air activities and bases for projected operations. For these, he received a Distinguished Flying Cross. AirSoPac ultimately encompassing U.S. Navy, Army, Marine Corps, and Royal New Zealand Air Force air units. It saw great success aiding the Allied campaign in the area. \n\nCommander, Aircraft, Solomons (ComAirSols), directed the combat operations of all land-based air forces in the Solomons during Operation Cartwheel, under the direction of AirSoPac. Rear Admiral Charles P. Mason was the first officer to hold the title ComAirSols; he assumed command on 15 February 1943 at Guadalcanal. Actually, Mason took over a going concern, as he relieved Brigadier General Francis P. Mulcahy, who had controlled all aircraft stationed at the island during the final phase of its defense. Mulcahy, who became Mason's chief of staff, was also Commanding General, 2d Marine Aircraft Wing. The fact that a general headed the staff of an admiral is perhaps the best indication of the multiservice nature of AirSols operations. \n\nVice Admiral Finch retained two areas of flight operations under his direct control; sea search by long range Navy patrol planes and Army bombers, and transport operations by South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command (SCAT). Throughout its long and useful life (November 1942-February 1945), SCAT's complement of Marine and Army transports was headed by Marine Aircraft Group 25's commanding officer. SCAT's operations area moved northward with the fighting during 1943, and by August's end, all regularly scheduled flights in SoPac's rear areas were being handled by the Naval Air Transport Service (NATS). \n\n\n\n"}

A normal consular army during this period consisted of 2 legions, composed of Roman citizens only, and 2 allied \"alae\". Alae were somewhat larger than normal legions (ca. 5,400 v. ca. 4,500 men). From the time of the first Roman emperor, Augustus (ruled 30 BC - AD 14), the term \"ala\" was used in the professional imperial army to denote a much smaller (ca. 500), purely cavalry unit of the non-citizen auxilia corps, see Ala (Roman cavalry unit).\n\nWhen, at a later date, the Roman armies were composed partly of Roman citizens and partly of Socii (allies from the rest of the Italian mainland), either Latini or Italici, it became the practice to marshal the Roman troops in the centre of the battle line and the \"Socii\" upon the wings. Armies of the middle republic would consist of two legions of Roman citizens and two legions of \"ala\", with the ala supplying thirty turmae of cavalry per legion, whereas the Roman provided only ten turmae. Hence \"ala\" and \"alarii\" denoted the contingent furnished by the allies, both horse and foot, and the two divisions were distinguished as \"dextera ala\" (right wing) and \"sinistra ala\" (left wing) (Livy, xxvii.2 , Livy, xxv.21 , Livy xxxi.21 ; Lips. \"de Milit.

The frigate, designed by Joshua Humphreys, was launched on 10 July 1776, by Wharton and Humphreys at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Captain Nicholas Biddle was appointed commander of the \"Randolph\" on 11 July, and he took charge of the frigate in mid-October.\n\nSeamen were scarce and recruiting was slow, delaying the ship's maiden voyage. Captured British seamen were \"dragged\" from jail in Philadelphia; the resulting riot required the soldiers appointed to carry the men to the ship to fire into the prison windows. Finally manned, \"Randolph\" sailed down the Delaware River on 3 February 1777, and three days later rounded Cape Henlopen, escorting a large group of American merchantmen to sea. On the 15th, the convoy separated, with some of \"Randolph's\" charges heading for France and the rest setting course for the West Indies.\n\nThe frigate herself turned northward, hoping to encounter HMS \"Milford\", a British frigate which had been capturing New England shipping. Before long, she boarded a ship which proved to be French and was set free. Then, as she continued the search, \"Randolph\" sprung her foremast. While the crew labored to rig a spar as a jury mast, the ship's mainmast broke and toppled into the sea.\n\nContinuing the hunt was out of the question. Now seeking to avoid the Royal Navy's warships, Biddle ordered the ship south toward the Carolina coast.\n\nFever broke out as the \"Randolph\" painfully made her way, and many members of the crew were buried at sea. A mutiny of the captured British seamen had to be put down before the ship could reach Charleston, South Carolina, on the afternoon of 11 March.\n\nTwice, after her repairs had been completed and as she was about to get underway, the frigate was kept in port by lightning-splintered mainmasts. Meanwhile, the ship, undermanned when she left Philadelphia, was losing more of her men from sickness, death, and desertion.\n\nRecruiting was stimulated by bounty, and \"Randolph\" was finally readied for sea - this time with her masts protected by lightning rods. She departed Charleston on 16 August and entered Rebellion Road to await favorable winds to put to sea. Two days later, a party from the frigate boarded merchantman \"Fair American\", and impressed two seamen who earlier had been lured away from Biddle's ship.\n\nInshore winds kept \"Randolph\" in the roadstead until the breeze shifted on 1 September, wafting the frigate across Charleston Bar. At dusk, on the 3rd, a lookout spotted five vessels: two ships, two brigs, and a sloop. After a nightlong chase, she caught up with her quarry the next morning and took four prizes: a 20-gun privateer, \"True Briton\", laden with rum, for the British troops at New York; \"Severn\", the second prize, had been recaptured by \"True Briton\" from a North Carolina privateer while sailing from Jamaica to London with a cargo of sugar, rum, ginger, and logwood; the two brigs, \"Charming Peggy\", a French privateer, and \"L’Assomption\", laden with salt, had also been captured by \"True Briton\" while plying their way from Martinique to Charleston.\n\n\"Randolph\" and her rich prizes reached Charleston on the morning of 6 September. While the frigate was in port having her hull scraped, the president of South Carolina's General Assembly, John Rutledge, suggested to Biddle that \"Randolph\", aided by a number of State Navy ships, might be able to break the blockade which was then bottling up a goodly number of American merchantmen in Charleston Harbor. Biddle accepted command of the task force, which, besides \"Randolph\", included \"General Moultrie\", \"Notre Dame\", \"Fair American\", and \"Polly\".\n\nThe American ships sailed on 14 February 1778. When they crossed the bar, Biddle's ships found no British cruisers. After seeing a number of merchantmen to a good offing, the ships proceeded to the West Indies hoping to intercept British merchantmen. After two days, they took and burned a dismasted New England ship which had been captured by a British privateer while headed for St. Augustine, Florida. Thereafter, game was scarce. They encountered only neutral ships until \"Polly\" took a small schooner on 4 March bound from New York to Grenada. Biddle manned the prize as a tender.\n\nOn the afternoon of 7 March, \"Randolph\"s lookouts spotted sail on the horizon. At 21:00 that evening, that ship, now flying British colors, came up on the \"Randolph\" as the largest ship in the convoy, and demanded they hoist their colors. The \"Randolph\" then hoisted American colors and fired a broadside into the British ship, mistakenly believing the ship to be a large sloop. The stranger turned out to be the British 64-gun ship of the line, HMS \"Yarmouth\".\n\nAs a 64-gun, two-deck line-of-battle ship, \"Yarmouth\" had double the number of guns as \"Randolph\". \"Yarmouth\"s guns were also significantly heavier, mounting 32 pound cannons on her main deck, 18 pounder guns on her upper deck and 9 pounder guns on her quarterdeck and forecastle, giving her almost five times the weight of shot that \"Randolph\" could fire. The \"Randolph\" and General Moultrie engaged \"Yarmouth\" until the \"Randolph\"s magazine exploded with a blinding flash. The \"Yarmouth\" was struck with burning debris up to six feet long, which significantly damaged her sails and rigging as well as killing five, and wounding twelve.\n\nThe damage caused to \"Yarmouth\"'s sails and rigging prevented her from pursuing the remaining South Carolina ships which slipped away in the darkness.\n\nThe loss of the \"Randolph\" resulted in the deaths of 311 of her crew, including Capt. Nicholas Biddle, with 4 survivors.\n"}

Four were known as 'penitential psalms' by St. Augustine of Hippo in the early 5th century. The fiftieth Psalm (\"Miserere\") was recited at the close of daily morning service in the primitive Church. Translations of the penitential psalms were undertaken by some of the greatest poets in Renaissance England, including Sir Thomas Wyatt, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, and Sir Philip Sidney. Before the suppression of the minor orders and tonsure in 1972 by Paul VI, the seven penitential psalms were assigned to new clerics after having been tonsured.\n\nPerhaps the most famous musical setting of all seven is by Orlande de Lassus, with his \"Psalmi Davidis poenitentiales\" of 1584. There are also settings by Andrea Gabrieli and by Giovanni Croce. The Croce pieces are unique in being settings of Italian sonnet-form translations of the Psalms by Francesco Bembo. These were widely distributed; they were translated into English and published in London as Musica Sacra; and were even translated (back) into Latin and published in Nürnberg as Septem Psalmi poenitentiales. William Byrd set all seven Psalms in English versions for three voices in his \"Songs of Sundrie Natures\" (1589). Settings of individual penitential psalms have been written by many composers. Well-known settings of the \"Miserere\" (Psalm 50/51) include those by Gregorio Allegri and Josquin des Prez; yet another is by Bach. Settings of the \"De profundis\" (Psalm 129/130) include two in the Renaissance by Josquin.\n\n"}

Multiple references in ancient Greek, Roman, and Hebrew Bible sources exist for this city, but its exact location remains somewhat uncertain. A number of scholars identified it as the later archaeological site of \"Tell El Maskhuta\". Others identified it as the earlier archaeological site of \"Tell El Retabeh\". \n\nThis name comes from Hebrew פיתום \"Pithom\" which was taken from the Late Egyptian name *Pi-ʔAtōm (< *Par-ʔAtāma) 'House of Atum'. Atum, a solar deity, was one of the major gods of ancient Egypt, and a sun-god of Heliopolis.\n\nPithom is one of the cities which, according to Exodus , was built for the Pharaoh of the oppression by the forced labor of the Israelites. The other city was Ramses; and the Septuagint adds a third, \"\"On\", which is Heliopolis.\" These cities are called by a Hebrew term rendered in the Authorized Version \"treasure cities\" and in the Revised Version \"store cities.\" The Septuagint renders it \"strong [or \"fortified\"] cities.\" The same term is used of certain cities of King Solomon in I Kings 9:19 (comp. also II Chronicles 16:4).\n\nHeroöpolis was a large city east of the Nile Delta, situated near the mouth of the Royal Canal which connected the Nile with the Red Sea. Although not immediately upon the coast, but nearly due north of the Bitter Lakes, Heroöpolis was of sufficient importance, as a trading station, to confer its name upon the arm of the Red Sea which runs up the Egyptian mainland as far as Arsinoë (near modern Suez) -- the modern Gulf of Suez. It was the capital of the 8th nome of Lower Egypt.\n\nEarly on, the location of Pithom—just like the locations of other similar sites, such as Tanis—had been the subject of much conjecture and debate.\n\nThe 10th century Jewish scholar, Saadia Gaon, identified the place in his Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch as Faiyum, southwest of Cairo.<br>\nÉdouard Naville and Flinders Petrie were looking for Pithom along the Wadi Tumilat, an arable strip of land serving as the ancient transit route between Egypt and Canaan across the Sinai—the biblical 'Way of Shur'. In the spring of 1883, Naville believed he had identified Pithom as the archaeological site Tell El Maskhuta. The site of Pithom, as identified by Naville, is at the eastern edge of Wadi Tumilat, south-west of Ismaïlia. Petrie agreed with this identification. John Holladay, a more recent investigator of the site, also supports this opinion.\n\nEight miles west from Tell El Maskhuta is the site of Tell El Retabeh. This is approximately the midpoint of Wadi Tumilat.\n\nHere was found a group of granite statues representing Ramesses II, two inscriptions naming \"Pr-Itm\" (Temple of Atum), storehouses and bricks made without straw. So archeologists (wrongly) concluded that this was the site of Pi-Ramesses. The excavations carried on by Naville for the Egypt Exploration Fund uncovered a city wall, a ruined temple, and the remains of a series of brick buildings with very thick walls and consisting of rectangular chambers of various sizes, opening only at the top and without any entrances to one another.\n\nSome scholars, such as Manfred Bietak and Kenneth Kitchen, have argued that this was the ancient Pithom. This opinion goes back to the 19th century, when Alan Gardiner first identified Pithom with the site of Tell El Retaba, and this was later accepted by William F. Albright, and Kenneth Kitchen. Yet archeological excavations seem to show that Tell El Retaba had been unoccupied during the period when we find monuments relating to a town called Pithom.\n\nNaville identified all these locations as being in the region of Tjeku (Sukkot), the 8th Lower Egypt nome.\n\nThe joint Polish-Slovak mission has carried out a systematic research at Tell El Retaba since 2007.\n\nMore recent analyses have demonstrated that the designation for the temple of Atum, \"pr-itm\", can be found in inscriptions at both sites—both at Tell El Retaba and at Tell El Maskhuta. This seems to demonstrate that the name 'Pithom' was used originally for the earlier site, Tell El Retaba, before it was abandoned. And when the newer city of Tel El Maskhuta was built, the same name was applied to it as well – as the temple of Atum was moved to El Maskhuta. Thus, in effect, 'Pithom' was moved to a new location, which phenomenon is attested with some other cities as well, such as Migdol.\n\nModern excavations at Tel El Maskhuta were carried out by the University of Toronto 'Wadi Tumilat Project' under the direction of John Holladay. They worked over five seasons between 1978 and 1985. These excavations have shown that the history of Tel El Maskhuta is quite complex. There was a Middle Bronze IIB settlement there (18th-17th centuries BC), associated with the Hyksos, followed by a long break until the late 7th century BC, when there was rebuilding.\n\nThis construction at the end of the 7th century may have been carried out by Pharaoh Necho II, possibly as part of his uncompleted canal building project from the Nile to the Gulf of Suez.\n\n"}
{"id": "1791330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791330", "title": "Pisidia", "text": "Pisidia\n\nPisidia (; , \"Pisidía\"; ) was a region of ancient Asia Minor located north of Lycia, bordering Caria, Lydia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, and corresponding roughly to the modern-day province of Antalya in Turkey. Among Pisidia's settlements were Antioch(ia) in Pisidia, Termessos, Cremna, Sagalassos, Etenna, Neapolis, Selge, Tyriacum, Laodiceia Katakekaumene and Philomelium.\n\nAlthough Pisidia is close to the Mediterranean Sea, the warm climate of the south cannot pass the height of the Taurus Mountains. The climate is too dry for timberland, but crop plants grow in areas provided with water from the mountains, whose annual average rainfall is c. 1000 mm on the peaks and 500 mm on the slopes. This water feeds the plateau. The Pisidian cities, mostly founded on the slopes, benefited from this fertility. The irrigated soil is very suitable for growing fruit and for husbandry.\n\nThe area of Pisidia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic age, with some settlements known from historical times ranging in age from the eighth to third millennium BC. The ancestors of the classical Pisidians were likely present in the region before the 14th century BC, when Hittite records refer to a mountain site of \"Salawassa\", identified with the later site of Sagalassos. At that time, Pisidia appears to have been part of the region the Hittites called \"Arzawa\". The Pisidian language is poorly known, but is assumed to be a member of the Anatolian branch of Indo-European languages.\n\nThere is a \"lacuna\" (gap) in the text of Herodotus (7.76), but it is doubtful to surmise a reference to the Pisidians in that passage. There can be little doubt that the Pisidians and Pamphylians were the same people, but a distinction between the two seems to have been established at an early period. Herodotus, who does not mention the Pisidians, enumerates the Pamphylians among the nations of Asia Minor, while Ephorus mentions them both, correctly including the one among the nations on the interior, the other among those of the coast. Pamphylia early received colonies from Greece and other lands, and from this cause, combined with the greater fertility of their territory, became more civilized than its neighbor in the interior. Pisidia remained a wild, mountainous region, and one of the most difficult for outside powers to rule.\n\nAs far back as the Hittite period, Pisidia was host to independent communities not under the Hittite yoke. Known for its warlike factions, it remained largely independent of the Lydians, and even the Persians, who conquered Anatolia in the 6th century BC, and divided the area into satrapies for greater control, were unable to cope with constant uprisings and turmoil.\n\nAlexander the Great had a somewhat better fortune, conquering Sagalassos on his way to Persia, though the city of Termessos defied him. After Alexander died, the region became part of territories of Antigonus Monophthalmus, and possibly Lysimachus of Thrace, after which Seleucus I Nicator, founder of the Seleucid Dynasty of Syria, took control of Pisidia. Under the Seleucids, Greek colonies were founded at strategically important places and the local people Hellenised. Even so, the Hellenistic kings were never in complete control, in part because Anatolia was contested between the Seleucids, the Attalids of Pergamon, and the Galatians, invading Celts from Europe. The cities in Pisidia were among the last in western Anatolia to fully adopt Greek culture and to coin their own money.\n\nPisidia officially passed from the Seleucids to the Attalids as a result of the Treaty of Apamea, forced on Antiochos III of Syria by the Romans in 188 BC. After Attalos III, the last king of Pergamon, bequeathed his kingdom to Rome in 133 BC as the province of Asia, Pisidia was given to the Kingdom of Cappadocia, which proved unable to govern it. The Pisidians cast their lot with pirate-dominated Cilicia and Pamphylia until the Roman rule was restored in 102 BC.\nIn 39 BC Marcus Antonius entrusted Pisidia to the Galatian client king Amyntas and charged him with suppressing a people of the Taurus Mountains known as the Homonadesians, who sometimes controlled the roads connecting Pisidia to Pamphylia.\n\nAfter king Amyntas of Galatia was killed in the struggle in 25 BC, Rome made Pisidia part of the new province of Galatia. The Homonadesians were finally wiped out in 3 BC.\n\nDuring the Roman period Pisidia was colonized with veterans of its legions to maintain control. For the colonists, who came from poorer parts of Italy, agriculture must have been the area's main attraction. Under Augustus, eight such colonies were established in Pisidia, and Antioch and Sagalassos became the most important cities. The province was gradually Latinised. Latin remained the formal language of the area until the end of the 3rd century.\n\nPisidia became an important early Christian centre. Paul the Apostle preached in Antioch on his first journey. He also visited the area in his second and third journeys. After the Emperor Constantine's legalization of Christianity in 311, Antioch in Pisidia (which has various namesakes, including the Patriarchate in Syria) played an important role as the Christian metropolitan see as well as being the capital of the civil province of Pisidia. Most Pisidian cities were heavily fortified at that time due to civil wars and foreign invasions.\n\nThe area was devastated by an earthquake in 518, a plague around 541–543, and another earthquake and Arab raids in the middle of the 7th century. After the Muslim conquest of Syria disrupted the trade routes, the area declined in importance. In the 8th century the raids increased. In the 11th century the Seljuk Turks captured the area and founded the Seljuk Sultanate in Central Anatolia. Pisidia frequently changed hands between the Byzantine Empire and the Turks until 1176, when Sultan Kılıçarslan defeated Manuel Komnenos in the Battle of Myriocephalon (thousand heads), which ended Byzantine rule and cemented Turkish rule of the area.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1791332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791332", "title": "Reference class problem", "text": "Reference class problem\n\nIn statistics, the reference class problem is the problem of deciding what class to use when calculating the probability applicable to a particular case. \n\nFor example, to estimate the probability of an aircraft crashing, we could refer to the frequency of crashes among various different sets of aircraft: all aircraft, this make of aircraft, aircraft flown by this company in the last ten years, etc. In this example, the aircraft for which we wish to calculate the probability of a crash is a member of many different classes, in which the frequency of crashes differs. It is not obvious which class we should refer to for this aircraft. In general, any case is a member of very many classes among which the frequency of the attribute of interest differs. The reference class problem discusses which class is the most appropriate to use.\n\nMore formally, many arguments in statistics take the form of a statistical syllogism:\n\n\nformula_2 is called the \"reference class\" and formula_3 is the \"attribute class\" and formula_4 is the individual object. How is one to choose an appropriate class formula_2?\n\nIn Bayesian statistics, the problem arises as that of deciding on a prior probability for the outcome in question (or when considering multiple outcomes, a prior probability distribution). \n\nJohn Venn stated in 1876 that \"every single thing or event has an indefinite number of properties or attributes observable in it, and might therefore be considered as belonging to an indefinite number of different classes of things\", leading to problems with how to assign probabilities to a single case. He used as an example the probability that John Smith, a consumptive Englishman aged fifty, will live to sixty-one.\n\nThe name \"problem of the reference class\" was given by Hans Reichenbach, who wrote, \"If we are asked to find the probability holding for an individual future event, we must first incorporate the event into a suitable reference class. An individual thing or event may be incorporated in many reference classes, from which different probabilities will result.\"\n\nThere has also been discussion of the reference class problem in philosophy.\n\nApplying Bayesian probability in practice involves assessing a prior probability which is then applied to a likelihood function and updated through the use of Bayes' theorem. Suppose we wish to assess the probability of guilt of a defendant in a court case in which DNA (or other probabilistic) evidence is available. We first need to assess the prior probability of guilt of the defendant. We could say that the crime occurred in a city of 1,000,000 people, of whom 15% meet the requirements of being the same sex, age group and approximate description as the perpetrator. That suggests a prior probability of guilt of 1 in 150,000. We could cast the net wider and say that there is, say, a 25% chance that the perpetrator is from out of town, but still from this country, and construct a different prior estimate. We could say that the perpetrator could come from anywhere in the world, and so on.\n\nLegal theorists have discussed the reference class problem particularly with reference to the Shonubi case. Charles Shonubi, a Nigerian drug smuggler, was arrested at JFK Airport on Dec 10, 1991, and convicted of heroin importation. The severity of his sentence depended not only on the amount of drugs on that trip, but the total amount of drugs he was estimated to have imported on seven previous occasions on which he was not caught. Five separate legal cases debated how that amount should be estimated. In one case, \"Shonubi III\", the prosecution presented statistical evidence of the amount of drugs found on Nigerian drug smugglers caught at JFK Airport in the period between Shonubi's first and last trips. There has been debate over whether that is the (or a) correct reference class to use, and if so, why.\n\nOther legal applications involve valuation. For example, houses might be valued using the data in a database of house sales of \"similar\" houses. To decide on which houses are similar to a given one, one needs to know which features of a house are relevant to price. Number of bathrooms might be relevant, but not the eye color of the owner. It has been argued that such reference class problems can be solved by finding which features are relevant: a feature is relevant to house price if house price covaries with it (it affects the likelihood that the house has a higher or lower value), and the ideal reference class for an individual is the set of all instances which share with it all relevant features.\n\n"}

The town of Pinerolo was one of the main crossroads in Italy, and was therefore one of the principal fortresses of the dukes of Savoy. Its military importance was the origin of the well-known military school that still exists today. The fortress of Fenestrelle is nearby. Later, Pinerolo was ruled by the abbot nullius of Pinerolo, who ran the abbey of Abbadia Alpina, even after the city had established itself as a municipality (1247) under the government of Thomas II of Savoy.\n\nFrom 1235, Amadeus IV of Savoy exercised over the town a kind of protectorate, which became absolute in 1243, and was continued thereafter by either the House of Savoy, or its cadet-branch, the House of Savoy-Acaia.\n\nWhen French troops invaded Piedmont (1536), Pinerolo was conquered; it remained under French control until 1574. It fell again to France in 1631 with the treaty of Cherasco.\n\nFrance agreed to hand Pinerolo back to the house of Savoy under the Treaty of Turin (1696), with the conditions that its stronghold's fortifications be demolished and that Savoy withdraw from the League of Augsburg against Louis XIV.\n\nIt is around Pinerolo that revolves the economy of the waldensian valleys (right slope of Val Chisone, Valle Germanasca and Val Pellice) and of the plain between these valleys and the Po (river) course.\n\nSeveral industries have their base in this area, particularly mechanical, paper making, chemical and textile industries, and also absorb manpower from the nearby centres.\n\nThe leading companies are Freudenberg Sealing Technologies (former Corcos), which produces seals for rotating shafts and valves sterns, Raspini, a meat processing company, TN Italy (former NN Inc.), which manufactures ball bearings, the Trombini Group (ex Annovati), which supplies the furniture industry with chipboard, and PMT Italia, which supplies the pulp and paper industry with paper machines.

The park contains over thirty peaks more than in elevation, and two-thirds of the area within the park is above . The elevation difference in the park is , and there are many canyons, cliffs, and valleys.\n\nBecause of its remote location and entry control, Yushan National Park is not among the most visited national parks in Taiwan. Even so, the park still attracted 1,044,994 visitors in 2015.\n\nTaiwan, which owes its existence to the power of plate tectonics, remains a place of regular seismic activity. Examples of geological features such as fault lines, joints, and folding can be seen throughout Yushan National Park:\n\nThe southern \"Cross Island Highway\" and \"Yushan Scenic Highway\" both offer countless opportunities to witness the area’s special geological features.\n\nYushan area is an important watershed of main river systems in central, southern, and eastern Taiwan. It is the water sources of Zhuoshui River (濁水溪), Kaoping River (高屏溪), and Siouguluan River (秀姑巒溪). The Chenyoulan (陳有蘭溪), Jyunda (郡大溪), Nanzaisian (楠梓仙溪), Laonong (荖濃溪), and Lekuleku(拉庫拉庫溪) rivers are all from Yushan with V-shaped river bed.

It was formed when Chenyoulan River (陳有蘭溪) cuts through land traversed by a fault line, it showcases one of the best examples of headway erosion. Jinmentong cliffs (金門峒斷崖), Yunlong Waterfall (雲龍瀑布) and Yinyu Waterfall (乙女瀑布; also known as 七絲瀑布) are some popular scenic points in the park.\n\nAlpine lakes such as Dashueiku (大水窟), Tafen Pond (塔芬池), Jiaming Lake (嘉明湖), and Tienchih (天池) are formed from rain and melting snows in the shadows of surrounding mountain peaks. These lakes provide animals including visitors precious water from the mountains. However, the ecosystem around them is fragile and need further protection.\n\nYushan National Park is well known for its diverse climate zones and rich biodiversity. The plants found in the park spans from subtropical at its foothills to alpine at its summits.\n\nDifferences in altitudes, precipitous cliffs, and plunging valleys in the Yushan National Park lend to the park highly unstable weather conditions. Temperatures can vary from warm to cold at the same time at places relatively close. While accounting for merely 3% of Taiwan’s total land area, the park has half of Taiwan’s native plant species growing within its boundaries. In surveys, there are 2,522 different kinds of plants found in the park.\n\nWith increasing elevation, there are the following six vegetation zonations in the park:\n\nThe park is home to a large variety of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and butterflies. Between the months of March and May, visitors have the chance to see processions of butterflies fluttering through mountain valleys. In the following table, it shows total different kinds of animals found in the park:\n\nIn the past, many of these species became endangered due to over-hunting; but with the establishment of the Yushan National Park, they are gradually making a comeback. Larger mammals such as the black bear, sambar deer, Taiwan macaque, and serows can sometimes be seen, and their call is often heard.\n\nPrehistoric relics, such as stone tools and pottery, found in the Wangshiang (望鄉) and Dongpu (Tungpu;東埔) areas, provide evidence of early human occupation. The Bunun , an aboriginal tribe, presently inhabits the villages of Dongpu (Tungpu;東埔) and Meishan (梅山). They emigrated from the coastal plains to the mountains some 300 years ago. Another tribal people, Tsou, who live in the west of the park, have been largely assimilated by the Bunun. Displacement of aboriginals by settlers occurred during the Qing Dynasty with the construction of the 100-km Patung-kuan Historical Trail (Batongguan Historic Trail; 八通關古道) in 1874 for defense purposes. Some stone steps, walls and guard-posts are the remains from that past.\n\nTo promote eco-tourism, the park has established protection laws and raised public awareness of the importance of nature conservation on one hand and provided public facilities for easy access on the other hand.

Following its broadcast, a scene in the episode garnered criticism from the Catholic League, but the controversy went largely ignored by \"The Simpsons\"' staff. \n\nThe episode received very positive reviews from critics, and is considered one of the best episodes of the season.\n\nAfter a long morning at church, the Simpsons go to the grocery store Eatie Gourmet's to take advantage of free samples in lieu of a Sunday brunch and Bart's suggestion that the family go Catholic so they can have \"communion wafers and booze\". At the store, Homer wants to buy a lobster, but since the larger ones are too expensive (eight dollars a pound), he decides to \"buy an eight dollar lobster, fatten it into an eighty dollar lobster and eat the profits\". Homer also tries to look for normal flavors of ice cream among the unusually named flavors at the \"Ken & Harry's\" factory plant, so he puts Lisa into the freezer to look for some in the back, which ultimately causes her to catch a cold.\n\nAlthough Lisa hates the idea, Marge wants Lisa to stay home from school for the next few days to recover from her cold. Lisa is derisive about playing one of Bart's video games in order to pass the time, but soon becomes addicted to it, and consequently ignores the homework on \"The Wind in the Willows\" that she is given by Ralph Wiggum. She even fakes the perpetuation of her illness so that she can continue playing the game. When Marge finally compels her to return to school, Lisa realizes she is unprepared for a test on the book, having not read it. In a panic she visits Bart, who brings her to Nelson, from whom she gets the test answers. Miss Hoover grades the tests over lunch, and Lisa is awarded the rare grade of A+++. Meanwhile, Homer becomes attached to his lobster and names him Pinchy. When the time comes to cook Pinchy, Homer cannot bring himself to do it, and instead declares him a part of the family.\n\nThe family is extremely proud of Lisa's \"achievement\", although she is guilt-ridden at having cheated. The next day at school, Principal Skinner informs Lisa that her test grade has brought Springfield Elementary's GPA up to the state's minimum standard, and they now qualify for a basic assistance grant. Lisa admits that she cheated on the test, but Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers persuade her to keep it a secret so the school can keep the money. During the presentation, Lisa says that she understands how desperately the school needs the basic assistance grant money, but also says that the truth is more important, confessing that she cheated. However, this was anticipated by Skinner, who fooled Lisa by staging a fake presentation before the real one, with the comptroller being revealed as Otto wearing a latex mask, allowing the school to keep the money anyway. Meanwhile, Homer discovers that he has accidentally cooked Pinchy while giving him a hot bath. Later that night, a distraught Homer eats Pinchy and finds him delicious.\n\n\"Lisa Gets an \"A\"\" was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Bob Anderson. Although the episode was written by Maxtone-Graham, neither of the plots were conceived by him. The main plot involving Lisa was pitched by fellow \"Simpsons\" writer Ron Hauge, and the sub-plot involving Homer adopting a lobster was conceived by former staff writer Richard Appel. The writers found it difficult to \"get the subplot go[ing],\" and it took a long time to come up with the third act, according to Maxtone-Graham. The writers debated what name Homer would give his lobster. Hauge pitched that his name would be \"Shelly\", however they eventually settled on naming him \"Pinchy\". Hauge also pitched the name of the grocery store Eatie Gourmet's. At the end of the episode, when Homer is eating Pinchy, a lot of the dialogue was ad-libbed by Dan Castellaneta, who portrays Homer among other characters in the series. It took a long time for the writers to come up with an ending to the episode's main storyline. Eventually, they settled on an ending that parodied the 1973 caper film \"The Sting\".\n\nIn real life, lobsters are black in color, turning red after being cooked. However, in \"Lisa Gets an \"A\"\", Pinchy is red throughout the whole episode. The \"Dash Dingo\" video game was difficult to animate, according to Hauge, as the animators had to \"make it look less than \"The Simpsons\" style\". In order to achieve the desired effect, the animators decided to pixelate the video game. The episode features the second appearance of Gavin, who first appeared in the season seven episode \"Marge Be Not Proud\", and \"Range Rover Mom\", Gavin's mother. They were both voiced by Tress MacNeille. The false Comptroller Atkins was portrayed by series regular cast member Harry Shearer, while the real Atkins was voiced by Hank Azaria, who is also a regular cast member for the series. The name of the character was based on the name of Jacqueline Atkins, a writer's assistant on \"The Simpsons\". The episode also features Marcia Wallace, Pamela Hayden, Maggie Roswell, Russi Taylor and Karl Wiedergott.\n\nThe episode satirizes the \"skewed priorities\" sometimes associated with educational establishments. Even though Principal Skinner knows that Lisa cheated on her test, he \"looks the other way\" so that the school meets the requirements for government funding. In the DVD commentary for the episode, the episodes showrunner Mike Scully opined that \"there is a lot of truth in this story [...] There are certain requirements that the school has to meet in order to get state funding, and there are things that they'd rather look the other way on if it's gonna cost them money. This does really happen.\"\n\nWhile staying home from school, Lisa plays a video game called \"Dash Dingo\". The video game is a spoof of the 1996 platform video game \"Crash Bandicoot\". In a scene in the episode, Lisa imagines that she will fail the test. She imagines that the president of Harvard University, voiced by Dan Castellaneta, will be disappointed in her and recommend her to Brown University, where Otto was apparently on faculty. The scene was conceived by Maxtone-Graham, whose alma mater was Brown University. He stated that all his friends from Brown and Harvard \"loved\" the joke. The liqueur Drambuie is also mentioned in the episode. With the government-funded grant money, Springfield Elementary are able to afford a Coleco, a 1980s home computer.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on November 22, 1998, \"Lisa Gets an \"A\"\" received an 8.0 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 8 million viewers. The episode finished in 51st place in the ratings for the week of November 16–22, 1998, tied with the ABC program \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\".\n\nAfter its original broadcast, the episode garnered scrutiny from The Catholic League, an American Roman Catholic advocacy group. In a scene in the episode, the Simpsons are on their way home from a church service, and Bart says \"I'm starving. Mom, can we go Catholic so we can get Communion wafers and booze?\" To which Marge replies \"No, no one is going Catholic. Three children is enough, thank you.\" In an issue of the Catholic League's monthly newspaper \"Catalyst\", the organization wrote \"The Fox animated TV show, \"The Simpsons\", is loved by millions for its engaging characters. It was with regret, therefore, that we were forced to take issue with its November 22 episode [\"Lisa Gets an \"A\"\"].\" They added that William Anthony Donohue, the current president of the organization, had sent a letter to Fox, reading \"Can you possibly explain why this dialogue was included in the show?\" In response, Thomas Chavez, Fox's manager for broadcast standards and practices, wrote a \"lengthy\" letter, in part re-printed on the same issue of \"Catalyst\". It read:\n\nAccording to Mark I. Pinsky, author of \"The Gospel According to The Simpsons\", the Catholic League was \"not persuaded\" by Chavez' letter, and stated that they \"sarcastically\" responded in \"Catalyst\": \"Now why didn't we think of that? Just goes to show how thoughtful the Hollywood gang really is.\" According to Pinsky, the controversy did not have any impact on the show and was \"simply ignored\" by \"The Simpsons\" staff.\n\nOn August 7, 2007, the episode was released as part of \"The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD box set. Matt Groening, Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Ron Hauge, Yeardley Smith and Mike B. Anderson participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode.\n\nFollowing its home video release, \"Lisa Gets an \"A\"\" received generally positive reviews from critics. \n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\" described it as \"A fabulously defining moment in Lisa's life, showing what happens if you let your guard slip.\" They continued by writing \"What makes this work even more is the false ending which shows that everyone in Springfield is as adept at predicting Lisa's morality as the viewers are.\" They concluded their review by calling it \"An absolutely inspired piece of comedy.\" \n\nColin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that he \"[took] great delight in the way this episode skewers the skewed priorities of the educational establishment.\" He added that \"Lisa acts like her usual prissy self, but that factor acts to allow the show to succeed.\" He concluded by writing that the episode \"connects to real emotions pretty well and offers some funny moments.\" \n\nDigital Entertainment New's Jake McNeill described it as one of the season's best episodes, giving particular praise to its subplot, which he called \"great\". \n\nJames Plath of DVD Town wrote that \"the real fun in this episode comes from Homer's attachment to a lobster he brings home.\"\n\n\n"}

The original Sons of Erin line-up featured Dermot and Fergus along with Gary Kavanagh and band leader Ralph O'Brien. When the band broke up Dermot, Fergus and Gary continued on for one tour as O'Reilly's Men and upon returning to Toronto met up with Don Sullivan to form the original Sullivan's Gypsies. Ralph O'Brien reformed The Sons Of Erin with new members Johnnie Lynn, Little John Cameron and Denis Ryan and recorded a self-titled LP. Shortly afterward Denis left to join Sullivan's Gypsies. Ryan's Fancy came to be when Sullivan's Gypsies parted ways.\n\nThe trio relocated to St. John's, Newfoundland in 1971 to attend Memorial University of Newfoundland. Making a splash in the local music scene, the group landed the first of several television series. Produced by Jack Kellum on CBC, the show involved the trio travelling and playing across Atlantic Canada. Ryan's Fancy had their own syndicated series called \"Ryan's Fancy\" (January 1972 to April 1972) and the pub-styled \"Tommy Makem and Ryan's Fancy\" (July to September 1974). Plus, in 1980, they starred and performed in the CBC-TV movie \"Pirate's Gold\". It was in this period that accordion virtuoso James Keane from Dublin became a band-member and contributor of traditional music to the ballad-focused trio. Shortly after Keane left the band, Ryan's Fancy split. Keane moved to New York City, where he became part of the traditional scene there through the 1980s to the present day.\n\nThe group disbanded in 1983. Denis Ryan moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia and became an investment banker and businessman while Fergus O'Byrne and Dermot O'Reilly remained in St. John's. Fergus completed a degree in education and began a successful career as a teacher and performer, while Dermot opened a music recording studio, called Piperstock Productions. Fergus can be seen performing weekly on George Street at O'Reilly's Pub in St. John's. Fergus also continues to tour both nationally and internationally with Jim Payne and A Crowd Of Bold Sharemen.\n\nIn 2004, Ryan's Fancy were awarded the Dr. Helen Creighton Lifetime Achievement Award of the East Coast Music Association.\n\nDermot O'Reilly died on 17 February 2007, from a heart attack at age 64. He was survived by fellow former Ryan's Fancy members Ryan and O'Byrne.\n\n\nAlden Nowlan's 1982 poem, \"He Sits Down on the Floor of a School for the Retarded\" described visiting a psychiatric hospital with Ryan's Fancy, as they have been asked to play for the patients\n\n\n\n"}

() is a 1999 Korean crime-comedy film directed by Kim Sang-jin and written by Park Jung-woo.\n\nThe film tells the story of a quartet of thugs who rob a gas station out of sheer boredom, having robbed it only a few days previously. Unable to get any money from the register, they take everyone hostage and start dispensing gas and keeping the money. The film becomes progressively more and more farcical as the characters find different ways of amusing themselves, mostly through the mixed cast of characters that come in through the gas station. However, it's only a matter of time before they start upsetting the wrong people.\n\nDuring the question and answer session at a screening during the 2000 Vancouver International Film Festival, director Kim Sang-jin indicated that the film inspired real-life copycats in South Korea.\n\nThe young cast of then-little known actors would go on to bigger careers: Lee Sung-jae, Yu Oh-seong, Yoo Ji-tae, and Lee Yo-won.\n\nHaving robbed and thoroughly destroyed a gas station, a group of street thugs with their own gripes against society sit in a convenience store and out of sheer boredom, decide to rob the same gas station (as the title card reads, \"Why do they attack the gas station? Just because!\"). But, since the manager had the foresight and sense to stash the money away, the four gang members take the manager and the employees hostage and stick around, dispensing gas to all the customers and keeping the money.\n\nA range of characters stop for gas throughout the film, not all with good intentions, but with ludicrous results. A gang of school bullies come by the gas station to harass one of the employees for money (they end up being taken hostages, while the bullied employee ends up being forced into a fist fight with one of the bullies... and wins) The police come by demanding free gasoline (the four thugs refuse, as the police clearly aren't doing their job). A customer refuses to pay for a full tank of gas, only asking for half a tank, and is taken hostage. More school bullies come by the gas station, seeking revenge for the first fight, but then they too are taken hostage. The four titular thugs also order unusually large amounts of food from a Chinese restaurant, and the deliveryman becomes suspicious.\n\nIt's not long until they start attracting the wrong kind of attention, which leads to a violent confrontation with the police and further gang members. The fight ends when No Mark sprays everyone in the chaos with gasoline and threatens to throw a lighter at them. The four thugs escape while everyone else remains panicked at the gas station.\n\nDuring the credits, four scenes show what the characters do after the events in the film: Paint appears to be a successful painter, but he angers a customer when he celebrates by spilling red paint all over one of the paintings. Rockstar restarts his career as a lead singer, and he bosses his members as they prepare for their next performance. Bulldozer becomes a policeman, and he scolds teenagers for smoking. He punishes the kids the same way he dealt with the hostages, and warns them about their futures by alluding to his own past. No Mark joins a baseball team, but accidentally hits the catcher while pitching.\n\n\n\"Attack the Gas Station\" was released around a time of economic turmoil in South Korea in the mid-to-late 1990s called the \"IMF crisis,\" culminating with many Korean car manufacturers laying off thousands of employees. There are many allusions to this throughout the film, mostly when Paint discovers framed pieces of paper with slogans promoting a productive work force (which he subsequently destroys in a fit of rage).\n\nThe film also makes a comment on American economic imperialism during a scene where Ddan Dda-Ra drinks from a can of Pepsi and a police officer chides him for his choice, chastising him for \"giving money to the Yankees.\" The young punk defends his choice, saying that Pepsi is a Korean product, referring to the Pepsi logo's resemblance of the Taeguk symbol on the South Korean flag.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1791383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791383", "title": "Pentaceratops", "text": "Pentaceratops\n\nPentaceratops (\"five-horned face\") is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaur from the late Cretaceous Period of what is now North America.\n\n\"Pentaceratops\" fossils were first discovered in 1921. The genus was named in 1923 when its type species \"Pentaceratops sternbergii\" was described. \"Pentaceratops\" lived around 76–73 million years ago, its remains having been mostly found in the Kirtland Formation in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico. About a dozen skulls and skeletons have been uncovered, so anatomical understanding of \"Pentaceratops\" is fairly complete. One exceptionally large specimen later became its own genus, \"Titanoceratops\", due to its more derived morphology, similarities to \"Triceratops,\" and lack of unique characteristics shared with \"Pentaceratops\".\n\n\"Pentaceratops\" was about 6 meters (20 feet) long, and has been estimated to have weighed around five tonnes. It had a short nose horn, two long brow horns, and long horns on the jugal bones. Its skull had a very long frill with triangular hornlets on the edge.\n\nThe first specimens were collected by Charles Hazelius Sternberg in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico. Sternberg worked in commission for the Swedish Uppsala University. In 1921 he recovered a skull and a rump, specimens PMU R.200 and PMU R.286, at the Meyers Creek near the Kimbetoh Wash in a layer of the Kirtland Formation. He sent these fossils to paleontologist Carl Wiman. In 1922 Sternberg decided to work independently and began a dig north of Tsaya Trading Post, in the Fossil Forest of San Juan County. Here he discovered a complete skeleton, which he sold to the American Museum of Natural History. The museum then sent out a team headed by Charles Mook and Peter Kaisen to assist Sternberg in securing this specimen; subsequent digging by Sternberg in 1923 brought the total of AMNH specimens to four. The rump of the main specimen was discarded by the museum because it had insufficient value as a display.\n\nThe species was named and described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1923, as \"Pentaceratops sternbergii\". The generic name means \"five-horned face\", derived from the Greek \"penta\" (πέντα, meaning five), \"keras\" (κέρας, horn) and \"-ops\" (ὤψ, face), in reference to its two long epijugal bones, spikes which protrude out sidewards from under its eyes, in addition to the three more obvious horns as with \"Triceratops\". Osborn obligingly gave it the specific name \"sternbergii\" to honor its discoverer. The name had been suggested to Osborn by William Diller Matthew; the specific epithet served as a consolation to the almost bankrupt Sternberg whose 1923 fossils were initially not acquired by the museum that had to use its 1923/1924 budget to process the finds of the great Asian expeditions by Roy Chapman Andrews.\n\nThe holotype was the skull discovered by Sternberg in 1922, specimen AMNH 6325. It was found in a layer of the Fruitland Formation, dating from the Campanian, about seventy-five million years old. The other three AMNH specimens were AMNH 1624, a smaller skull; AMNH 1622, a pair of brow horns; and AMNH 1625, a piece of skull frill.\n\nIn 1930, Wiman named a second species of \"Pentaceratops\": \"P. fenestratus\". It was based on Sternberg's 1921 specimens and the specific name referred to a hole in the left squamosal. This was later considered to be the same species as \"Pentaceratops sternbergii\" and thus a junior synonym, the hole being the likely effect of an injury.\n\nIn 1929 Steinberg's son, George Fryer Sternberg, discovered specimen USNM V12002, a right squamosal. \"Pentaceratops\" proved to be a quite common fossil in the Fruitland and Kirtland formations. It has even been used as a guide fossil: the appearance of \"Pentaceratops sternbergii\" in the fossil record marks the end of the Judithian land vertebrate age and the start of the Kirtlandian. Subsequent finds include specimens MNA Pl. 1668, MNA Pl. 1747, NMMNH P-27468 and USNM 2416, partial skeletons with skull; YPM 1229, a skeleton lacking the skull; UALP 13342 and UKVP 16100, skulls; UNM B-1701, USNM 12741, USNM 12743, USNM 8604, SMP VP-1596, SMP VP-1488, SMP VP-1500 and SMP VP-1712, fragmentary skulls. Apart from the San Juan Basin finds, a juvenile specimen of \"Pentaceratops\", SDMNH 43470, was found in the Williams Fork Formation of Colorado in 2006.\nSometimes the identification of a specimen as \"Pentaceratops\" has proven to be highly contentious. In 1998 Thomas Lehman described OMNH 10165, a very large skull and its associated skeleton found in New Mexico in 1941. The skull is presently on display at the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, and is the largest \"Pentaceratops\" exemplar known, with the distinction of having produced the largest known skull of any land vertebrate. However, in 2011, the skeleton was renamed as a separate genus, \"Titanoceratops\", due to its more derived morphology, similarities to \"Triceratops,\" and lack of unique characteristics shared with \"Pentaceratops\".\n\nIn 2014 Nicholas Longrich named a new species: \"Pentaceratops aquilonius\", \"the northern one,\" based on fragmentary fossils discovered during the 1930s near Manyberries in Canada. The species has been described as having a first epiparietal pointing upwards instead of forwards. In 2016, Mallon \"et al.\" found \"P. aquilonius\" to be morphologically similar to \"Spiclypeus shipporum\", with it possibly being the same species, and considered \"P. aquilonius\" a \"nomen dubium\".\n\n\"Pentaceratops\" was a large ceratopsid; Dodson estimated the body length at 6 meters. The skull length of AMNH 1624 is 2.3 meters while PMU R.200 has a length of 2.16 meters. In 2016 Paul estimated its length at 5.5 meters (18 ft) and its weight at 2.5 tonnes (2.75 short tons). The nose horn of \"Pentaceratops\" is small and pointing upwards and backwards. The brow horns are very long and curving strongly forwards. The somewhat upward tilted frill of \"Pentaceratops\" is considerably longer than that of \"Triceratops\", with two large holes (parietal fenestrae) in it. It is rectangular, adorned by large triangular osteoderms: up to twelve episquamosals at the squamosal and three epiparietals at the parietal bone. These are largest at the rear corners of the frill, and are separated by a large U-shaped notch at the midline, a feature not recognized until 1981 when specimen UKVP 16100 was described. Within the notch the first epiparietals point forwards. The very thick jugal and the squamosal do not touch each other, a possible autapomorphy.\n\nThe torso of \"Pentaceratops\" is tall and wide. The rear dorsal vertebrae bear long spines from which ligaments possibly ran to the front, to balance the high frill. The prepubis is long. The ischium is long and strongly curves forward. In smaller specimens the thigh bone bows outwards.\n\nOsborn originally assigned \"Pentaceratops\" to Ceratopsia. Within this group \"Pentaceratops\" belonged to the Ceratopsinae or Chasmosaurinae. It appears to be most closely related to \"Utahceratops\". Their clade was perhaps more derived than the earlier genus \"Chasmosaurus\" but more basal than \"Anchiceratops\", the latter representing a line of which \"Triceratops\" was a member, which lived a few million years later, right at the end of the Cretaceous period, when all ceratopsians died out.\n\nThe cladogram of the phylogeny of \"Pentaceratops\" according to a study by Scott Sampson et al. in 2010 found that the genus was most closely related to \"Utahceratops\", from a similar age and region. The below cladogram follows Longrich (2014), who named a new species of \"Pentaceratops\", and included nearly all species of chasmosaurine.\n\nLongrich stated that the holotype and referred specimen of \"P. aquilonius\" fall within the diagnosis of \"Pentaceratops\", and were recovered very close to the type species in the phylogeny. He noted that the placement of \"Utahceratops\" does not make the genus paraphyletic, as there is no requirement that genera are monophyletic. The Williams Fork chasmosaur differs from the \"Pentaceratops\" and \"Utahceratops\" species, and might require a new specific or generic name.\n\n\"Pentaceratops\", like all ceratopsians, was an herbivore. During the Cretaceous, flowering plants were \"geographically limited on the landscape\" and so it is likely that this dinosaur fed on the predominant plants of the era: ferns, cycads and conifers. It would have used its sharp ceratopsian beak to bite off the branches which were then shredded - leaves, needles and all - by the tooth batteries, providing a self-sharpening continuous cutting edge in both upper and lower jaws. Ultimately the plant material was digested by the large gut.\n\n\"Pentaceratops\" lived around 76–73 million years ago, its remains having been mostly found in the Kirtland Formation in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico. Other dinosaurs that shared its habitat include \"Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus\", the pachycephalosaur \"Sphaerotholus\", the armored dinosaur \"Nodocephalosaurus\" and the tyrannosauroid \"Bistahieversor\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Fazlul Huq\n\nAbul Kasem Fazlul Huq (, ; 26 October 1873 — 27 April 1962) popularly known as Sher-e-Bangla (\"Tiger of Bengal\"), was a British Indian statesman and jurist who served as the first Prime Minister of Bengal and later as the Home Minister of Pakistan. A key figure in Pakistan Movement, widely remembered for presenting Pakistan Resolution, he played major political roles in British India and later in Pakistan (including East Pakistan, today's Bangladesh) and held various other political offices.\n\nHuq was first elected to the Bengal Legislative Council from Dhaka in 1913; and served on the council for 21 years until 1934. He was a member of the Central Legislative Assembly for 2 years, between 1934 and 1936. For 10 years between 1937 and 1947, he was an elected member of the Bengal Legislative Assembly, where he was Prime Minister and Leader of the House for 6 years. He was later elected to the East Bengal Legislative Assembly, where he was Chief Minister for 2 months; and to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, where he was Home Minister for 1 year, in the 1950s.\n\nHuq boycotted titles and knighthood granted by the British government. He was notable for his English oratory during speeches to the Bengali legislature. Huq courted the votes of the Bengali middle classes and rural communities. He pushed for land reform and curbing the influence of zamindars. Huq was considered a leftist and social democrat on the political spectrum. His ministries were marked by intense factional infighting. In 1940, Huq had one of his most notable political achievements, when he presented the Lahore Resolution. During the Second World War, Huq joined the Viceroy of India's defence council and supported Allied war efforts. Under pressure from the Governor of Bengal during the Quit India movement and after the withdrawal of the Hindu Mahasabha from his cabinet, Huq resigned from the post of premier in March 1943. In the Dominion of Pakistan, Huq worked for five years as East Bengal's attorney general and participated in the Bengali Language Movement. He was elected as chief minister, served as a federal minister and was a provincial governor in the 1950s.\n\nHuq became secretary of the Bengal Provincial Muslim League in 1913. In 1929, he founded the All Bengal Tenants Association, which evolved into a political platform, including as a part of the post-partition United Front. Huq held important political offices in the subcontinent, including President of the All India Muslim League (1916-1921), General Secretary of the Indian National Congress (1916-1918), Education Minister of Bengal (1924), Mayor of Calcutta (1935), Prime Minister of Bengal (1937-1943), Advocate General of East Bengal (1947-1952), Chief Minister of East Bengal (1954), Home Minister of Pakistan (1955-1956) and Governor of East Pakistan (1956-1958). Huq was fluent in Bengali, English and Urdu, and had a working knowledge of Arabic and Persian. Huq died in Dacca, East Pakistan on 27 April 1962. He is buried in the Mausoleum of Three Leaders. The Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area of Dhaka, which houses the National Parliament, is named after Huq. The Sher-e-Bangla Cricket Stadium is also named after him. In 2004, Huq was voted fourth in a BBC poll of the Greatest Bengali of all time.\n\nHuq was born into a middle class Bengali Muslim family in Bakerganj, Barisal, in 1873. He was the son of Muhammad Wazid, a reputed lawyer of the Barisal Bar, and Sayedunnessa Khatun. His paternal grandfather Kazi Akram Ali was a Mukhtar and a scholar of Arabic and Persian. Initially home schooled, he later attended the Barisal District School, where he passed the FA Examination in 1890. Huq moved to Calcutta for his higher education. He sat for his bachelor's degree exam in 1894, in which he achieved a triple honours in chemistry, mathematics and physics from the Presidency College now (Presidency University). He then obtained a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Calcutta in 1896. He obtained his Bachelor in Law from the University Law College in Calcutta in 1897.\n\nFrom 1908 to 1912, Huq was the Assistant Registrar of Co-operatives. He resigned from public service and opted for public life and law. Being advised by Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee, he joined the bar council of the Calcutta High Court and started legal practice. He practiced in the Calcutta High Court for 40 years.\n\nAfter the First Partition of Bengal, Huq attended the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference hosted by Sir Khwaja Salimullah in Dacca, the erstwhile capital of Eastern Bengal and Assam. The conference led to the formation of the All India Muslim League. The annulment of the partition led to the formation of the Bengal Provincial Muslim League, in which Huq became secretary. With the patronage of Sir Salimullah and Syed Nawab Ali Chowdhury, he was elected to the Bengal Legislative Council from Dacca Division in 1913.\n\nIn 1916, Huq was elected president of the All India Muslim League. Huq was one of those who were instrumental behind formulating the Lucknow Pact of 1916 between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League. In 1917 Huq was a Joint Secretary of the Indian National Congress and from 1918-1919 he served as the organization's General Secretary. He is the only person in history to concurrently hold the presidency of the League and the general secretary's position in the Congress. In 1918, Huq presided over the Delhi Session of the All India Muslim League.\n\nIn 1919, Huq was chosen as a member of the Punjab Enquiry Committee along with Motilal Nehru, Chittaranjan Das and other prominent leaders set up by the Indian National Congress to investigate the Amritsar massacre. Huq was the president of the Midnapore Session of the Bengal Provincial Conference in 1920.\n\nDuring the Khilafat movement, Huq led the pro-British faction within the Bengal Provincial Muslim League, while his rival Maniruzzaman Islamabadi led the pro-Ottoman faction. Huq also differed with the Congress leadership during its non-cooperation movement. Huq favored working within the constitutional framework rather than boycotting legislatures and colleges. He later resigned from the Congress.\n\nIn 1923, Huq served as education minister of Bengal for six months under the dyarchy system.\n\nThe dyarchy was replaced by provincial autonomy in 1935, with the first general elections held in 1937. Huq transformed the All Bengal Tenants Association into the Krishak Praja Party. During the election campaign period, Huq emerged as a major populist figure of Bengal. His party won 35 seats in the Bengal Legislative Assembly during the 1937 Indian provincial elections. It was the third largest party after the Bengal Congress and Bengal Provincial Muslim League. Huq formed a coalition with the Bengal Provincial Muslim League and independent legislators. He was elected as the Leader of the House and the 1st Prime Minister of Bengal.\n\nHuq's cabinet include Nalini Ranjan Sarkar (finance), Bijoy Prasad Singha Roy (revenue), Maharaja Srish Chandra Nandy (communications and public works), Prasanna Deb Raikut (forest and excise), Mukunda Behari Mallick (cooperative credit and rural indebtedness), Sir Khwaja Nazimuddin (home), Nawab Khwaja Habibullah (agriculture and industry), Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy (commerce and labour), Nawab Musharraf Hussain (judicial and legislative), and Syed Nausher Ali (public health and local self-government).\n\nIn 1940, Huq was selected by Muhammad Ali Jinnah to formally present the Lahore Resolution, which envisaged ‘independent states’ in the eastern and northwestern parts of India.\n\nOne of the notable measures taken by Huq included using both administrative and legal measures to relieve the debts of peasants and farmers. He protected the poor agriculturists from the clutches of the usurious creditors by enforcing the Bengal Agricultural Debtors' Act (1938). He established Debt Settlement Boards in all parts of Bengal. The Money Lenders' Act (1938) and the Bengal Tenancy (Amendment) Act (1938) improved the lot of the peasants. The Land Revenue Commission appointed by the Government of Bengal on 5 November 1938 with Sir Francis Floud as Chairman, submitted the final report on 21 March 1940. This was the most valuable document related to the land system of the country. The Tenancy Act of 1885 was amended by the Act of 1938 and thereby all provisions relating to enhancement of rent were suspended for a period of 10 years. It also abolished all kinds of abwab and (imposts) imposed traditionally by the zamindars on raiyats. The raiyats got the right to transfer their land without paying any transfer-fee to zamindars. The law reduced the interest rate for arrears of rent from 12.50% to 6.25%. The raiyats also got the right to get possession of the (land lost through river erosion and appeared again) land by payment of four years of rent within twenty years of the erosion. Thus several acts enforced during Huq's Premiership helped the peasants to lighten some of their burdens though Huq could not fully execute his programme of Dal-Bhat placed before the people during his election campaigns. Huq also promoted affirmative action for Bengali Muslims.\n\nHuq held the education portfolio in his cabinet. He introduced the Primary Education Bill in the Bengal Legislative Assembly, which was passed into law and made primary education free and compulsory. But there was a storm of protests from the opposition members and the press when Fazlul Huq introduced the Secondary Education Bill in the assembly as it incorporated 'principles of communal division in the field of education' at the secondary stage. Huq was associated with the foundation of many educational institutions in Bengal, including Calcutta's Islamia College and Lady Brabourne College, Wajid Memorial Girls' High School and Chakhar College.\n\nDue to intense factional infighting within the Krishak Praja Party, that Huq ended up being the lone party member on the cabinet. After 1939, the British Empire grappled with World War II. In 1941, Huq and Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, the Prime Minister of the Punjab, joined the Viceroy's National Defence Council. Their move angered Muhammad Ali Jinnah because they had not consulted him, and because it deviated from the Muslim League party line that the structure of the council was unacceptable inasmuch as it did not give the League parity with Congress.\n\nOn 2 December 1941, Huq resigned and governor's rule was imposed.\n\nThe second Huq coalition government was formed on 12 December 1941. The coalition was supported by most members in the Bengal Legislative Assembly, except for the Muslim League. Supporters included the secular faction of the Krishak Praja Party led by Shamsuddin Ahmed, the Forward Bloc founded by Subhash Chandra Bose, pro-Bose members of the Bengal Congress and the Hindu Mahasabha led by Syama Prasad Mukherjee.\nThe cabinet included Nawab Bahabur Khwaja Habibullah, Khan Bahadur Abdul Karim, Khan Bahadur Hashem Ali Khan, Shamsuddin Ahmed, Syama Prasad Mukherjee, Santosh Kumar Bose and Upendranath Barman.\n\nDespite Huq enjoying the confidence of most of the assembly, he had tense relations with the Governor of Bengal John Herbert. The governor favored the provincial Muslim League leaders and patrons, including Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin, the Leader of the Opposition; and the \"Calcutta Trio\" in the assembly, including Mirza Ahmad Ispahani, Khwaja Nooruddin and A. R. Siddiqui. The focal point of the League's campaign against Huq was that he was growing closer with Mukherjee, who was alleged to be working against the political and religious interests of the Muslims. The League appealed to the governor to dismiss the Huq ministry.\n\nThe fear of Japanese invasion during the Burma Campaign and the implementation by the military of a 'denial policy' implemented in 1942 caused considerable hardship to the delta region. A devastating cyclone and tidal waves whipped the coastal region on 26 October but relief efforts were hindered due to bureaucratic interference. On 3 August, a number of prisoners were shot down in Dhaka jail but no inquiry could be held again due to bureaucratic intervention. Another severe strain on the administration was caused when the Congress launched the Quit India movement on 9 August, which was followed by British political repression. The entire province reverberated with protest. The situation was further complicated when Mukherjee resigned bitterly complaining against the interference of the governor in the work of the ministry.\n\nOn 15 March 1943, the Prime Minister disclosed in the floor of the Assembly that on several occasions, under the guise of discretionary authority, the governor disregarded the advice tendered by the ministry and listed those occasions. The governor did not take those allegations kindly, and, largely due to his initiative, no-confidence motions were voted in the assembly on 24 March and 27 March. On both occasions the motions were defeated, although by narrow margins. To enforce his writ, the governor asked Huq to sign a prepared letter of resignation on 28 March 1943 and assigned himself the responsibility of administering the province under the provision of Section 92 of the constitution. A month later a League dominated ministry was commissioned with Nazimuddin as the Prime Minister. Huq's party won much fewer seats during the 1946 Indian provincial elections.\n\nAfter the partition of British India, Huq settled in Dhaka and became the Advocate General of the Government of East Bengal. He served in the position between 1947 and 1952. On 31 December 1948, while delivering a presidential address at a literary conference, Huq proposed a language academy for the Bengali language. He supported the Bengali Language Movement in 1952. Huq was also injured during police action against demonstrators demanding that Bengali be made a state language of Pakistan.\n\nHuq was a leading figure in the United Front (East Pakistan) coalition along with Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Maulana Bhashani. The United Front won a landslide victory during the 1954 East Bengali legislative election. Huq himself defeated his arch rival Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin in the Patuakhali constituency.\n\nHuq became chief minister for two months. During his short lived ministry, he took measures to establish the Bangla Academy. King Saud of Saudi Arabia sent a plane to Dhaka to bring Huq for a meeting with the monarch in Karachi.\n\nA report in \"The New York Times\" stated that Huq wanted independence for East Bengal, which trigged his dismissal and the imposition of Governor General's rule. Huq was subsequently placed under house arrest.\n\nIn August 1955, a coalition between the Krishak Sramik Party in East Pakistan and the Muslim League in West Pakistan allowed Chaudhry Mohammad Ali to become Prime Minister and A. K. Fazlul Huq to become the federal Home Minister. Prime Minister Ali was later dismissed by President Iskander Mirza, who allowed a coalition of the Awami League and Republican Party to form government. As a result, the Krishak Sramik Party and the Muslim League formed the main opposition.\n\nHuq was appointed Governor of East Pakistan in 1956. He served in the position for two years until the 1958 Pakistani coup d'état. Huq was again placed under house arrest after the coup.\n\nHe was married three times. His first wife was Khurshid Begum with whom he had two daughters. The marriage ended in divorce. His second wife was Musammat Jannatunissa Begum who was from Howrah, West Bengal. They had no children. His third wife Khadija was from Meerut district, Uttar Pradesh. They had a son together, A. K. Faezul Huq, who played an active role in Bangladeshi politics.\n\nSher-e-Bangla founded several educational and technical institutions for Bengali Muslims, including Islamia College in Calcutta, Baker Hostel and Carmichael hostel residence halls for Muslim students of the University of Calcutta, Lady Brabourne College, Adina Fazlul Huq College in Rajshahi, Eliot hostel, Tyler Hostel, Medical College hostel, Engineering College hostel, Muslim Institute Building, Dhaka Eden Girls' College Building, Fazlul Huq College at Chakhar, Fazlul Huq Muslim Hall (Dhaka University), Fazlul Huq Hall(Bangladesh Agricultural University, then East Pakistan Agricultural University), Sher-e-Bangla Hall (Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology) Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU) Dhaka-1207, Bulbul Music Academy and Central Women's College. Sher-e-Bangla had significant contribution in founding the leading university of Bangladesh: Dhaka University. During his premiership Bangla Academy was founded and Bengali New Year's Day (Pohela Boishakh) was declared a public holiday.\n\nThroughout Bangladesh, educational institutions (e.g., Barisal Sher-e-Bangla Medical College), roads, neighbourhoods (Sher-e-Bangla Nagor), and stadiums (Sher-e-Bangla Mirpur Stadium) have been named after him. This depicts the respect of the people for Sher-e-Bangla. One of the main roads in Islamabad, Pakistan A.K. Fazal-ul-Haq Road is named after him.\n"}

Byrd, to have made the first flight to the North Pole in May 1926. However, their claim to have reached the pole is disputed.\n\nBennett was born in Warrensburg, New York, in 1890. He was an automobile mechanic before he enlisted in the Navy in 1917, during World War I. Bennett attended flight school, learned to fly and was rated as an Aviation Pilot. Bennett served with Richard E. Byrd on an aviation survey of Greenland in 1925, on which Byrd came to respect his ability as a pilot.\n\nByrd named Bennett as his pilot for an attempt to reach the North Pole by air in 1926. The expedition was financed by John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Edsel Ford, Vincent Astor and T. F. Ryan.\n\nBennett was at the controls on May 9 as the two men made their attempt, in a Fokker Tri-motor called the \"Josephine Ford\". They returned to their airfield in Spitzbergen on that day. During the flight, the aircraft's engine developed an oil leak. Bennett advised turning back but Byrd decided to continue the flight. Although members of the European press were skeptical of their claim (because it seemed that the plane had been away from Spitzbergen too briefly to have reached the North Pole), Byrd and Bennett were lionized as heroes in America.\n\nBoth Bennett and Byrd received the Medal of Honor, as well as the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for this feat. Upon their arrival in the United States, Byrd was awarded the Hubbard Medal of the National Geographic Society and Bennet was awarded a gold medal from the society in recognition of their achievement. The subsequent discovery of Byrd's diary of the flight, with erased (but still legible) sextant readings, has been considered as evidence they might not have reached the North Pole.\n\nAfter returning to the United States, Bennett flew the \"Josephine Ford\" on a goodwill tour of America, with Bernt Balchen as his co-pilot. Later in his life Balchen claimed that Bennett confessed to him that he and Byrd did not reach the North Pole but, instead, flew around in circles. Balchen would go on to pilot Byrd to the South Pole in 1929, became a highly decorated Army Air Forces officer during the Second World War and retired from the United States Air Force as a colonel.\n\nByrd and his team had been leading candidates to win the large Orteig Prize in 1927, to be awarded for the first nonstop flight between France and the United States. Once again, Byrd named Bennett as his pilot for the attempt. However, Bennett was seriously injured during a practice flight and the airplane, a Fokker F-VIIb-3m named \"America,\" was badly damaged when it crashed on take-off. Byrd and his fellow pilot George O. Noville were also slightly injured in the crash. Following this failure by Bennett and Byrd, Charles Lindbergh won the Orteig Prize, flying from Long Island, New York, nonstop to Paris, France.\n\nThe \"Bremen\" was a German aircraft which had just completed the first successful transatlantic aeroplane flight from east to west, but was stranded in Greenly Island, Canada at the end of that non-stop flight from Europe. Floyd Bennett and Bernt Balchen flew a Ford Trimotor to provide relief to the three stranded Bremen Flyers. Bennett had developed pneumonia following a previous crash, and died with a high fever while in flight on April 25, 1928. Balchen flew the remaining eight hours, and he was paid $10,000 ($ today) for the effort, an amount that was passed to Bennett's widow. Bennett's remains were buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nBennett and Byrd became national heroes upon their return from the Arctic when they arrived in New York on June 22, 1926. They received numerous honors from both governments and private organizations. Congress voted to award both men the Medal of Honor by a special act passed on December 21, 1926. The medals were presented to Byrd and Bennett at the White House by President Coolidge on February 25, 1927. Shortly after his return to the United States, Bennett was promoted from Chief Aviation Pilot to the warrant officer rank of Machinist. Bennett's date of rank as a warrant officer was May 9, 1926 - the date of his historic flight.\n\nBennett received the following awards during his career in the Navy:\n\n\nRank and organization: Machinist, U.S. Navy. Born: October 25, 1890, Warrensburg, N.Y. Accredited to: New York. Other Navy award: Distinguished Service Medal.\n\nCitation:\n\n\"For distinguishing himself conspicuously by courage and intrepidity at the risk of his life as a member of the Byrd Arctic Expedition and thus contributing largely to the success of the first heavier-than-air flight to the North Pole and return.\"\n\n\"The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Distinguished Service Medal to Aviation Pilot Floyd Bennett, United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service in a position of great responsibility to the Government of the United States.

{"id": "1791398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791398", "title": "Benguela railway", "text": "Benguela railway\n\nThe Benguela Railway (), also called the Katanga-Benguela railway, is a Cape gauge railway line that runs through Angola from west to east, being the largest and most important modal of the type in the country. It also connects to Tenke in Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the Cape to Cairo Railway (Kindu-DRC à Port Elizabeth-SAR).\n\nIts logistical facility is the port of Lobito on the Atlantic coast, from where it exports all types of products, from minerals (from the Copperbelt region), food, industrial components, live loads, etc.\n\nFrom the Angolan section of Lobito to the Luau, it is run by the Empresa do Caminho de Ferro de Benguela-E.P. From Dilolo to Tenke is run by the Société nationale des Chemins de fer du Congo.\n\nThe railway is Cape gauge, , which is used by most mainline railways in southern Africa. The maximum design speed is 90 km per hour. The design capacity is 20 million tons of cargo and 4 million passengers per year. There are 67 stations and 42 bridges along the route of the railway.\n\nThe highest point on the railway is 6,082 feet.\n\nThe railway line roughly follows old trade routes between the ancient trading centre of Benguela and its hinterland of the Bié plateau. In 1899, the Portuguese government initiated the construction of the railway to give access to the central Angolan plateau and the mineral wealth of the then Congo Free State. A concession, running for 99 years, was granted to Sir Robert Williams on 28 November 1902. His \"Benguela Railway Company\" took over the construction which commenced on 1 March 1903. \"Messrs Pauling & Co.\" and \"Messrs Griffiths & Co\" were contracted to build sections of the railway. By 1914 when World War I started, had been completed. Construction was halted until 1920 after which the railway's connection to Luau at the border to the Belgian Congo was completed in 1929. The primary purpose was the export trade and the \"domestic Angolan traffic would be of secondary importance.\"\n\nPassenger trains also ran between Lubumbashi and Lobito, connecting with passenger ship services to Europe. This provided a shorter route for Europeans working in the Katangan and Zambian Copperbelt, and the name \"Benguela Railway\" was sometimes used loosely to refer to the entire Lubumbashi–Lobito route, rather than the Tenke–Lobito section to which it strictly applies.\n\nIn its heyday, the Benguela Railway was the shortest way to transport mineral riches from the Congo to Europe. The line proved very successful and profitable, especially in the early 1970s after Zambia closed the border with the then Rhodesia. The railway reached an operational peak in 1973 when it transported 3.3 million tons of cargo, generated freight revenues of $30 million, and had 14,000 employees. Until the early 1970s, the railway was operated entirely by steam locomotives, oil-fired from the coast to Cubal, and then wood-fired from Cubal to the interior. Wood was supplied by eucalyptus trees grown on company-owned tree plantations. Steam locomotives outnumbered diesels as late as 1987.\n\nSoon after Angola gained its independence from Portugal in 1975, the Angolan Civil War broke out. The railway was heavily damaged during the war and progressively fell into disuse. The workshops in Huambo were destroyed. Ballast cars had to be coupled to the front of locomotives to detonate mines. By 1992, only 340 km of the railway remained in operation. When the 99-year concession expired in 2001, only 34 km remained in service, along the coast from Benguela to Lobito.\n\nThe railway was 90% owned by Tanganyika Concessions Limited (Tanks), a London-based holding company. Société Générale de Belgique purchased a minority share in Tanks in 1923 and acquired a controlling interest in 1981. The Belgian company remained the controlling owner of the railway when the concession expired in 2001, at which point ownership of the railway passed to the Angolan government.\n\nAfter the Angolan Civil War ended in 2002, the railway was reconstructed between 2006 and 2014 by the China Railway Construction Corporation at a cost of $1.83 billion. 100,000 Angolans were employed on the railway. Trains reached Huambo in 2011, Kuito in 2012, and Luau near the Congolese border in 2013. The rebuilt railway was formally inaugurated in February 2015.\n\nAccording to \"Jornal de Angola\" in May 2012, CfB employs 1,321 workers, and transported 129,430 passengers and 5,640 tons of goods in 2011. Two trains per day run between Lobito and Benguela, one per week to Huambo, and three per week between Lobito and Cubal.\nOn March 5, 2018, ore transport was restarted from the Tenke Fungurume Mine, in the D.R. Congo, from where copper and cobalt are extracted, and the cargoes are taken to the port of Lobito. From that date the railroad went into full operation, connecting the city of Tenke to the city of Lobito.\n\nThe Benguela railway line is to be electrified from Lobito to Cuamba.\n\nIn the Tolunda rail accident on 22 September 1994, damaged brakes caused a train to plunge into a canyon, killing 300.\n\n\n\n"}

His name is inseparably connected with Mary, Queen of Scots, for whom he conceived an insane passion.\n\nFrom the service of the Constable Montmorency, Chastelard, then a page, passed to the household of Marshal Damville, whom he accompanied in his journey to Scotland in escort of Mary (1561). He returned to Paris in the marshal's train, but left for Scotland again shortly afterwards, bearing letters of recommendation to Mary from his old protector, Montmorency, and the Regrets addressed to the Queen Dowager of France by Pierre de Ronsard, his master in the art of song. He undertook to transmit to the poet the service of plate with which Mary rewarded him. But he had fallen in love with the queen, who is said to have encouraged his passion.\n\nCopies of verse passed between them; she lost no occasion of showing herself partial to his person and conversation. The young man hid himself under her bed, where he was discovered by her maids of honour. Mary pardoned the offence, and the old familiar terms between them were resumed. Chastelard was so rash as again to violate her privacy. He was discovered a second time, seized, sentenced and beheaded the next morning. He met his fate valiantly and consistently, reading, on his way to the scaffold, his master's noble \"\", and turning at the instant of doom towards the palace of Holyrood, to address to his unseen mistress the famous farewell \"\" (\"farewell to you, so beautiful and so cruel, who kill me and whom I cannot cease to love\"). This at least is the version of the \"Memoirs of Brantôme\", who is, however, notoriously untrustworthy. But for his madness of love, it is possible that Chastelard would have left no shadow or shred of himself behind. As it is, his life and death are of interest as illustrating the wild days in which his lot was cast.\n\nThe English diplomat Thomas Randolph described the arrest of Chastelard in his letters to William Cecil. He notes Chastelard as a servant of Monsieur D'Anville. When he arrived in Scotland in November 1561, Mary showed him her favour by letting him ride a horse that was a present from her half-brother Lord Robert Stewart. He gave her a book of his own poems. On 14 February 1563, St Valentine's day, Chastelard was discovered in the Queen's chamber under her Great Bed at Rossend Castle at Burntisland. Mary ordered her half brother the Earl of Moray to execute him on the spot. But instead the unfortunate poet was taken to St Andrews. Randolph wrote that Chastelard had made a similar attempt at Holyroodhouse. In his defence, Chastelard claimed he had been caught in the Queen's privy but witnesses insisted he was under the bed. He was beheaded a week later at the Market Cross of St Andrews on market day. Mary was consoled by the company of Mary Fleming.\n\n\n"}

A graduate of the Naval Academy, he participated in the 1912 United States occupation of Nicaragua and the 1915 United States occupation of Veracruz. While serving with the War Plans Section of the Bureau of Navigation in Washington, D.C. between the World Wars, developed an interest in amphibious warfare. In 1940 he produced \"Fleet Training Publication 167 – Landing Operations Doctrine, United States Navy\", which would become the Navy's \"bible\" of amphibious operations, and would remain in use throughout World War II.\n\nAs commander Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet in 1940 and 1941 he supervised amphibious training and conducted Fleet Landing Exercises. In May 1942, Barbey was appointed to organize a new Amphibious Warfare Section within the Navy Department, which was charged with responsibility for the coordination of amphibious training and the development and production of the new generation of landing craft. In January 1943 he assumed command of Amphibious Force, Southwest Pacific Force, which became the VII Amphibious Force. He planned and carried out 56 amphibious assaults in the Southwest Pacific Area between September 1943 and July 1945. After the war, he commanded the Seventh Fleet and Fourth Fleet.\n\nDaniel Edward Barbey was born in Portland, Oregon on 23 December 1889. He graduated from the Naval Academy and was commissioned an ensign in June 1912. His first assignment was aboard the armored cruiser , which participated in the 1912 United States occupation of Nicaragua. In May 1914 he was transferred to the destroyer as engineering officer, participating in the United States occupation of Veracruz. He remained on \"Lawrence\", where he was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) on 8 June 1915, serving first as engineering officer, and later as executive officer and commanding officer. In October 1916 he became engineering officer of the gunboat , serving in Central American and Mexico waters. He received a Letter of Commendation from the Secretary of the Navy for the ship's service during the Mexican Revolution. Barbey was involved in the fitting out of the destroyer from December 1917 to May 1918, becoming its executive officer when it was commissioned on 24 May. Under an accelerated wartime promotion system, he was promoted to Lieutenant on 8 June 1918.\n\nBarbey was assigned to the Naval Base at Cardiff, Wales in January 1919, becoming the Naval Port Officer at Cardiff from July to August 1919, when he was transferred to the U.S. Naval Headquarters in London. In November 1919 he became Naval Port Officer, Constantinople, Turkey. In October 1920, he also became operations officer and flag secretary to Rear Admiral Mark L. Bristol, Commander U.S. Naval Detachment in Turkish Waters and High Commissioner to Turkey. Barbey ceased to be Naval Port Officer in July 1921, but continued as flag secretary to Admiral Bristol. During this time, Barbey served as the U.S. delegate on the Allied Commission for the Control of Trade with Turkey and as an observer with the White Army in the Crimea.\n\nReturning to the U.S. in February 1922, he served briefly on the cargo ship before becoming assistant engineering officer of the battleship in the Pacific. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 15 October 1922. Continuing the pattern of alternating duty afloat and ashore, he then spent two years as Officer in Charge of the Portland Navy Recruiting Station, before returning to the Atlantic as engineering officer of the light cruiser in June 1925. From February 1927 to June 1928, he was executive officer of the oil tanker . He then spent the next three years as aide to the Superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy, Rear Admiral Samuel S. Robison. From June 1931 to June 1933 he commanded the destroyer . He then spent two years as an inspector of ordnance at the Mare Island Naval Ammunition Depot in California, where he was promoted to the rank of commander in September 1933. In February 1935, he was posted to the battleship as damage control officer. He briefly commanded the before becoming Commander of Destroyer Division 17 in the Pacific.\n\nIn June 1937 Barbey was assigned to War Plans Section of the Bureau of Navigation in Washington, D.C.. During this assignment, he worked on mobilization plans, and developed an interest in amphibious warfare from studying reports of Japanese amphibious operations in the Second Sino-Japanese War. He was particularly intrigued by photographs of special landing craft with hinged bow ramps. In 1940 he produced \"Fleet Training Publication 167 – Landing Operations Doctrine, United States Navy\" (FTP 167). This would become the Navy's \"bible\" of amphibious operations, and would remain in use throughout World War II. He was promoted to captain in February 1940.\n\nBarbey assumed command of in the Pacific but in January 1941 he returned to the Atlantic to become Chief of Staff to Rear Admiral Randall Jacobs, Commander Service Force, Atlantic Fleet. This included the embryo Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet. In 1940 and 1941 he supervised the amphibious training of the 1st Marine Division and the 1st Infantry Division, conducting Fleet Landing Exercises along the coast of North Carolina. In May 1942, Admiral Ernest King, Commander in Chief U.S. Fleet appointed Barbey to organize a new Amphibious Warfare Section within the Navy Department. Barbey was charged with responsibility for the coordination of amphibious training and the burgeoning amphibious craft construction program. He became involved with the development and production of the new generation of landing craft. He was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in December 1942.\nOn 8 January 1943 Barbey assumed command of Amphibious Force, Southwest Pacific Force. He established his headquarters aboard the attack transport (APA) on the Brisbane River and set about building up his small training command into a major amphibious force capable of carrying out the strategy of the Supreme Commander, Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA), General Douglas MacArthur, for an amphibious advance from Australia to the Philippines. On 15 March 1943, \"by a stroke of Admiral King's pen,\" the Southwest Pacific Force became the Seventh Fleet and its Amphibious Force became the VII Amphibious Force. On meeting Barbey for the first time, MacArthur had only one question: \"are you a lucky officer?\"\n\nThe VII Amphibious Force inherited the Royal Australian Navy amphibious training center HMAS Assault at Port Stephens, New South Wales and a Combined Training School at Bribie Island and nearby Toorbul Point in Queensland. There was only one APA, the , which was in a poor state of repair and trailed an oil slick wherever it went, precluding its use in a combat zone, but VII Amphibious Force had three Australian assault transports, known as Landing Ships, Infantry (LSI): , and . For the moment, they were too valuable to risk in forward areas. They were augmented by a flotilla each of the new beaching craft, Landing Ships, Tank (LST), Landing Craft, Infantry (LCI) and Landing Craft, Tank (LCT). There were also a small number of high speed transports (APD). MacArthur directed that the two navies would use a common doctrine, FTP 167. However, this was written with the assumption that APDs would be available and carry \nbeach parties. Doctrine therefore required modification from the start.\n\nOperation Chronicle, the landings at Kiriwina and Woodlark Islands, was the VII Amphibious Force's first operation, presented no great difficulty as the islands were known to be unoccupied. However half the assault troops experienced seasickness, problems were encountered with clearing the sand bar at the entrance to Guasopa Harbor, and Barbey's decision to land at night and withdraw before dawn in order to avoid encountering Japanese aircraft highlighted the inexperience of his crews and deficiencies in their training. Unloading activities on the coral-fringed Kiriwina dragged on for a fortnight.\nFor the landing at Lae, Barbey elected to make a night approach and a dawn landing. As the LCIs approached the beach, they were set upon by three Mitsubishi G4M \"Betty\" bombers which score a bomb hit and two near misses on USS \"LCI-339\". Badly damaged and riddled by strafing bullets and fragments, the ship was beached but became a total loss. That afternoon, six LSTs were attacked by a force of about 80 Japanese aircraft. Some 48 Lockheed P-38 Lightnings were vectored to assist but USS \"LST-471\" and USS \"LST-473\" were hit, killing 57 crewmen and Australian troops.\n\nA few weeks later Barbey was called upon to make a landing at Finschhafen. Not confident of the promised air support, Barbey decided to make another night landing, with the landing ships clearing the beach before dawn. Major General George Wootten, the commander of the assault troops, doubted that the VII Amphibious Force could find the correct beach in the dark, and was proven correct by events; the VII Amphibious Force was not yet proficient enough to conduct night landings. Fortunately, this time Japanese air attacks failed to sink or damage any amphibious ships. For his part in the landings at Lae and Finschhafen, Barbey was awarded the Navy Cross. His citation read:\n\nThe Battle of Arawe and the Battle of Cape Gloucester involved a number of \"firsts\" for the VII Amphibious Force. It marked the first use of an Australian LSI, , in combat, and the first appearance in SWPA of a Landing Ship, Dock (LSD), . The LSD was used to carry amtracs, also making their debut in SWPA, which were necessary to cross the coral reefs. Fire support was provided by two LCIs equipped with rockets. This proved so successful that Barbey had another six modified for the purpose. Casualties were evacuated using specially modified LCTs and LSTS equipped as hospital ships. For the first time, Beach Party 1 participated, providing a fully trained naval beach party for the first time. Contrary to doctrine, it was not affiliated with a particular APA. The Arawe operation also saw the first use of another innovation of Barbey's, the landing craft control officers. However, an attempt to land a force in rubber boats was a total failure, and was not repeated. Afterward, Barbey received his first properly equipped amphibious command ship, the . He also acquired an experienced deputy in Rear Admiral William M. Fechteler. Fechteler commanded the assault on the Admiralty Islands, in which APDs were employed in order to meet the Army's requirement for a reconnaissance in force.\n\nDuring Operations Reckless and Persecution, Barbey personally directed the landing at Tanahmerah Bay. The beaches there proved to be unsuitable, and Barbey diverted the follow-up forces to Humboldt Bay. MacArthur told war correspondent Frazier Hunt that Barbey was \"just about the number one amphibious commander in the world,\" but Admiral Chester Nimitz was more critical. VII Amphibious Force carried nearly 80,000 personnel, 50,000 tons (56,000 m) of stores and 3,000 vehicles to the area but the resulting accumulation of stores on and immediately behind the beach included dumps in which fuel and ammunition were stored together. A lone Japanese aircraft bombed a dump and set off fires and explosions. Twenty men were killed and over a hundred wounded, and twelve LST loads of stores were destroyed. Meanwhile, three Japanese bombers attacked and torpedoed the cargo ship . The ship was severely damaged and towed back to Finschhafen with half its cargo still on board. For these operations, Barbey was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. His citation read:\n\nBarbey paid a visit to Washington, D.C. in June 1944 to discuss his needs but his trip was mistimed, for the Joint Chiefs of Staff had left for Europe to observe the Invasion of Normandy and Barbey had to wait for Admiral King to return. In their discussions, King emphasised that it was his intention that MacArthur's advance would proceed no further than Mindanao. This was scuttled in September 1944 by his own admirals, who recommended a descent on Leyte. By July enough amphibious ships had arrived in SWPA to allow Barbey to divide the VII Amphibious Force. Fechteler assumed command of Amphibious Group 8, while Amphibious Group 9 was formed under Rear Admiral Arthur D. Struble. In 1945, a third group, Amphibious Group 6, was formed under Rear Admiral Forrest B. Royal. For the invasion of Leyte, MacArthur and his naval commander, Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid expected that Barbey would continue in command of the amphibious forces, but Nimitz preferred the commander of the III Amphibious Force, Vice Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson, who was senior and in Nimitz's opinion, more experienced. In the end, a compromise was reached, with both amphibious forces participating, and Kinkaid in overall command. For his part, Barbey was awarded a second Navy Distinguished Service Medal. His citation read:\n\nPromoted to vice admiral on 9 December 1944, Barbey directed 30 more assaults in 1945, mostly in the southern Philippines and Borneo. He conducted the last amphibious operation of the war, the landings at Balikpapan, Borneo on 1 July 1945. In all, \"Uncle Dan\", as he was known, planned and conducted 56 amphibious operations, landing more than one million Australian and American soldiers and marines. For his wartime service in the Southwest Pacific, the U.S. Army awarded Barbey the Army Distinguished Service Medal. On Australia Day in 1948 the Australian government honored him with an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire, which was presented at the Australian embassy in Washington by Norman Makin, the Australian Ambassador to the United States.\n\nAfter the war, Barbey replaced Kinkaid as commander of the Seventh Fleet. He continued the task of landing occupation forces in South Korea and North China. While providing training, transportation and support to the Chinese Nationalist Party forces, he attempted to prevent his own forces from becoming embroiled in the Chinese Civil War, which was engulfing North China. In March 1946 he became Commander Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet. In September he became commander of the Fourth Fleet. He briefly returned to the Far East in February 1947 as Chairman of the Joint Military Board on fact-finding mission to evaluate strategic requirements there. He returned to the U.S. in March to become Commandant of the 10th Naval District and commander of the Caribbean Sea Frontier from 1 May 1947 until 10 October 1950. His final assignment was as Commandant of the 13th Naval District. He retired as a vice admiral on 30 June 1951.\n\nIn retirement, Barbey published his memoirs of his wartime service as \"MacArthur's Amphibious Navy\" in 1969. He died at the Naval Hospital in Bremerton, Washington on 11 March 1969. His papers are in the Naval Historical Center at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. The Navy named a , in his honor, which was launched at the Avondale Shipyards in Westwego, Louisiana by his widow on 4 December 1971.\n\nVice Admiral Daniel E. Barbey´s ribbon bar:\n"}

{"id": "1791425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791425", "title": "Windsor Great Park", "text": "Windsor Great Park\n\nWindsor Great Park is a Royal Park of , including a deer park, to the south of the town of Windsor on the border of Berkshire and Surrey in England. The park was, for many centuries, the private hunting ground of Windsor Castle and dates primarily from the mid-13th century. Historically the park covered an area many times the current size known as Windsor Forest, Windsor Royal Park or its current name. The only royal park not managed by The Royal Parks, the park is managed and funded by the Crown Estate. Most parts of the park are open to the public, free of charge, from dawn to dusk, although there is a charge to enter Savill Garden.\n\nThe park is Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Windsor Forest and Great Park is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.\n\nThe Great Park is a gently undulating area of varied landscape. It has sweeping deer lawns, small woods, coverts and areas covered by huge solitary ancient oak trees. There is a small river in the north of the park called the Battle Bourne running to the Thames near Datchet. The River Bourne runs through a number of ponds to the south. Chief amongst these are Great Meadow Pond and Obelisk Pond, near the great lake of Virginia Water. The most prominent hill is Snow Hill and the avenue of trees known as the \"Long Walk\" runs between here and Windsor Castle. The area is accessed by a number of gates: Queen Anne's Gate, Ranger's Gate, Cranbourne Gate, Forest Gate, Sandpit Gate, Prince Consort's Gate, Blacknest Gate, Bishop's Gate and Bear's Rails Gate and the original medieval park pale can still be seen in places. The main road known as Sheet Street (A332) into Windsor runs through the northeast of the park. On the western side of the park is The Village, built in the 1930s to house Royal estate workers. It has a village shop and infant/junior school. Other buildings include the Royal Lodge, Cumberland Lodge, the Cranbourne Tower and Norfolk Farm. The park lies mostly within the civil parish of Old Windsor, though the eastern regions are in the Borough of Runnymede and there are small areas in the parishes of Winkfield and Sunninghill. Areas associated with or attached to the Great Park, but not officially within its borders include the Home Park, Mote Park, Flemish Farm, Cranbourne Chase, Forest Lodge and South Forest.\n\nThe modern enclosed deer park is at the northern end of the Great Park. It is home to a large herd of semi-wild deer, reflecting the original medieval purpose of the park.\n\nThe Long Walk runs south from Windsor Castle to the 1829 Copper Horse statue of King George III atop Snow Hill where there are impressive views of the castle. It is from George IV Gateway at Windsor Castle to The Copper Horse. Other equestrian statues in the park include one of the Prince Consort, to the west of the polo grounds, and one of Queen Elizabeth II near the Village.\n\nThe Royal Lodge was built in the centre of the park as the Deputy Ranger's house. It was made into a retreat for the Prince Regent from 1812, but was largely pulled down after his death. The remains were renovated, in the 1930s, as a home for the Duke and Duchess of York before their accession as George VI and Queen Elizabeth. It is now the official residence of the Prince Andrew, Duke of York and not accessible by the public.\n\nThe Royal Chapel of All Saints was built after the chapels of the Royal and Cumberland Lodges proved too small for growing numbers of household staff. The chapel was built in 1825 by Jeffry Wyattville and regularly used by George IV during the refurbishment of Windsor Castle. It was later remodelled in the Gothic Revival style by Samuel Sanders Teulon and Anthony Salvin. Queen Victoria often attended the chapel as did the Duke and Duchess of York before their accession as George VI and Queen Elizabeth. It is regularly used by Queen Elizabeth II when she is in residence at Windsor.\n\nOther notable buildings in the park include Cumberland Lodge, built in 1652 during the Commonwealth. After the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 the Lodge quickly became the home of the Ranger of the Great Park, an office in the gift of the sovereign. Each Ranger made his – or in one case, that of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, her – own mark on the features of the house and its surroundings.\n\nThroughout her life Queen Victoria was a frequent visitor. Her daughter Princess Helena of the United Kingdom lived at the Lodge for over fifty years, presiding over elaborate re-building after a major fire in 1869 and extensive alterations in 1912. Lord FitzAlan, last British Viceroy of Ireland, was the last private person to be entrusted with the Lodge. It was in his time, in 1936, that the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, discussed the crisis over King Edward VIII's desire to marry Wallis Simpson, talks which led to his abdication of the crown a few weeks later. In 1947, the King made the Lodge available to the newly established St. Catharine's Foundation, later known as the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Foundation of St Catharine's. Today the organisation is simply known as Cumberland Lodge. Cumberland Lodge today is an educational charity dedicated to initiating fresh debate on questions facing society. The grounds are not generally open to the public, but the house is continually holding conferences, open days and lectures.\n\nThe private Cranbourne Tower is easily viewed from surrounding paths. It is all that survives of Cranbourne Lodge, the residence of the Keeper of Cranbourne Chase. It is thought to date back to the 16th century.\n\nIn the south-east of the park, near Englefield Green, are the well-endowed Savill Garden and Valley Gardens which were designed and built by Eric Savill in the 1930s and 1940s. They include an extraordinary range of flowers and trees from around the world. Smith's Lawn and Polo Grounds are also nearby, as is the tranquil Heather Garden. The Savill Garden Visitor Centre houses a gift shop; toilets; restaurant; coffee shop; ice cream counter; and a shop selling many plants found in the garden. The gardens are open to visitors between 10:00 and 16:30 in the winter and 10:00 and 18:00 in the summer.\n\nVirginia Water Lake, in the south of the park, is an artificially-created lake of around dating from the 1740s. Among the lakeside features are the high Canadian totem pole, carved by Mungo Martin, Henry Hunt, and Tony Hunt Sr., commemorating the centenary of British Columbia, and a collection of ornamental Roman ruins, transported from the site of Leptis Magna (modern-day Al-Khums) in 1816 and installed at Virginia Water in 1826.\n\nBeside a smaller lake, known as the Obelisk Pond, is the Obelisk memorial to the Duke of Cumberland. This is inscribed\nIt was originally inscribed \"Culloden\" but this was erased on Queen Victoria's orders and replaced with \"Cumberland\": \"Cumberland\" is inscribed within an inset in the masonry, the original surface having had \"Culloden\".\n\nWindsor Castle was begun in the 11th century by William the Conqueror as it afforded a good defensive point over the River Thames. A vast area of Windsor Forest to the south of the castle became reserved by the King for personal hunting and also to supply the castle with wood, deer, boar and fish. It was not until later that it became necessary to formally define this area. In 1129, the first \"parker\" was appointed, and in 1240, King Henry III officially set out the borders of the \"Park\", a region many times larger than the current Great Park. The castle was a mere fortress at this time and, when hunting, King Henry would have been resident at the more comfortable manor house of Old Windsor (what later became known as Manor Lodge). The title \"Parker\" exists today as \"Ranger of the Park\", the current title-holder being Prince Philip. Kings Edward I and Edward III used the park for jousts and tournaments and the latter had his Royal stud there to supply horses for the Hundred Years' War. The moat at Bear's Rails contained the manor house of Wychamere, the home of William of Wykeham while he was building the castle. It was later used for bear-baiting.\n\nExcept for a brief period of privatisation by Oliver Cromwell implying subdivision to pay for the civil war, the area remained the personal property of the monarch until the reign of George III when control over all Crown lands was handed over to Parliament. Today the Park is owned and administered by the Crown Estate, a public body established by Act of Parliament in which the monarch and family members associated with its particular parts have non-executive, advisory roles.\n\nBy the 18th century, the food value of the parkland to Windsor had decreased in importance and the new Hanoverian monarchs preferred to build and garden the land rather than hunt in it. The Long Walk had been laid out by King Charles II and the planting of its trees completed by William of Orange in the 1680s, with double rows of elms which lasted until World War II, but the Georges extended it and built numerous features and monuments, such as the Copper Horse (depicting George III) and the Obelisk (in honour of William, Duke of Cumberland). George III had a set of 2,000-year-old Roman ruins imported from Libya and placed in the park.\n\nVirginia Water was begun in 1746 by William, Duke of Cumberland who was then Ranger of the Park. Few details are recorded of the building of the lake; however it has been suggested that prisoners of war from the recent Jacobite risings, who were encamped at the nearby Breakheart hill, were involved. The original lake was much smaller than the current form, and was destroyed in a flood in 1768. In 1780, Paul and Thomas Sandby began construction of a much larger lake at the site, and went on to add an artificial waterfall, Meadow Pond and Obelisk Pond. The lake replaced a small stream of the same name which was probably named after Queen Elizabeth I, who was known as the \"Virgin Queen\".\n\nQueen Victoria was probably the greatest patron of the Park. Following the death of her beloved Albert, she largely withdrew from public life, retreating in part to the Park. At adjoining Frogmore she built a Royal Mausoleum for Albert. She was later buried there upon her own death, along with a number of other subsequent members of the royal family.\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th century, one of the main events for farmers near and far was the Christmas sale of stock from the Royal Windsor Estates. Held on the same week as the Smithfield Show, buyers came from all over the country to buy something from the monarch. The sale in 1850 was held on 17 December by Messrs Buckland & Sons of Windsor, and included Superior Fat Heifers for £20 each; 10 fat ewes, fed by Prince Albert for 33/10; Fine Old Wether Sheep fed by His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch for 40/6. The sale made a total of £226. On 12 December 1894, Messrs Buckland & Sons were proud to announce:\n\n<poem>The Prince Consort's Flemish Farm\nA Xmas sale of fat stock belonging to HM the Queen\nON WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1894\nAt One o'Clock precisely\nCarriages will meet the Trains at both Windsor Stations</poem>\n\nDuring the World Wars, the \"Smith's Lawn\" area of the Park was used for housing troops. During the 1940s, much of the deer park was ploughed and farmed for food, which involved the felling of hundreds of ancient trees. Over 200 large bombs fell on the land, including several V-2 rockets. During the 1948 Summer Olympics, the park was used as the road cycling venue. In the 1950s, the Park was gradually turned into the recreation area open to the public that it is today. This involved the re-planting of Savill Gardens (which had been allowed to run wild during the war) and the new Valley Gardens. In 1951, a large wall for creeping plants was built at Savill using bricks from bombed-out London buildings. In 1958, a Totem pole was installed nearby, a gift from British Columbia to the Queen.\n\nIn 1972 Ubi Dwyer organised the \"People's Free Festival\", the first of the Windsor Free Festivals in the Park, attended by 700 people. A co-organiser Sid Rawle claimed that Windsor Great Park has been common land until the 18th century, and inclosed (made private) by George III. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was reported to be \"furious\". Ubi and his allies repeated the festival in 1973 with at least 1,400 in attendance. In 1973, the Windsor Great Park regulations were introduced. In 1974, 7,000 people turned up but it was violently broken up by police, who made 220 arrests and the festival was banned. Dwyer was jailed the next year for distributing leaflets to promote another festival and Rawle was given three months for reproducing parts of Ubi's leaflets in the underground newspaper \"International Times\".\n\nA new visitor centre designed by Glenn Howells Architects and Buro Happold was opened in June 2006, and was nominated for the 2007 Stirling Prize.\n\nIf travelling by road with satellite navigation, use the address: Windsor Great Park, Windsor, SL4 2HT to enter via Rangers Gate, but bear in mind that access is strictly for authorised vehicles only. There are several other road, horse and foot entrances which may have a different post code, particularly the Long Walk entrance off the A308, SL4 2HH, some 1.05 mi (1.7 km) south of Windsor.\n\nIf walking from Windsor, follow the A332 road south from Windsor for 1.86 mi (3 km).\n\nAccess to \"some\" of the extensive \"private\" areas of the Great Park is available, on application, for an annual \"key rental\" fee of £20 (2011 price) plus deposit. Contact the Crown Estate Office, The Great Park, Windsor, Berkshire, SL4 2HT.\n\nAccess to the park is governed by Windsor Great Park Regulations 1973 S.I. 1973/1113, displayed on boards at most entrances. \n\nEvery five or six years since 1993 Windsor Great Park has been home to the Scout and Girlguiding camp WINGS (Windsor International Guides and Scouts camp), last held in August 2014.\n\nAt the 15th World Conference of WAGGGS it was decided to mark the centenary of the birth of Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of Guiding, by holding a World Camp with four locations — Doe Lake, Ontario, Canada; Quezon City, Philippines; Lac de Conche, Swizerland; and Windsor Great Park, from 19 January to 2 February 1957.\n\nWindsor Great Park was featured on the cover and inner booklet of the 1978 Elton John album \"A Single Man\". The Crown Estate has allowed the use of the Park as a filming location and the Great Park has been used on \"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince\", \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" (\"Parts 1\" and \"2\"), \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", Sir Ridley Scott's \"Robin Hood\", and \"Snow White and the Huntsman\". In 2014 the Park was used as a location for \"Into the Woods\". \"The King's Speech\" made extensive use of Cumberland Lodge. \"\" was on location in the South Forest in early 2015; \"\" used various locations during May and June 2015; \"Bridget Jones's Baby\" was filming on location on Duke's Lane in October 2015, \"Flowers\" from Channel 4 was filming in December 2015 in South Forest & Penslade Bottom, and Windsor Great Park \"Friends and Members News\" Summer 2015 edition refers to the filming of the 2016 Warner Bros. film, \"The Legend of Tarzan\", and the 2015 Disney film \"Cinderella\". It has doubled as Scottish lochside forests, the River Thames (\"Robin Hood\", 2010, \"Virginia Water\"), and the slopes of Mount Fuji.

It was one of very few collections of Latin liturgical music to survive the Reformation, and hence is an important source. It originally contained music by 24 different composers; however, many of the pieces are damaged or incomplete. It is one of three large choirbooks surviving from early-Tudor England (the others are the Lambeth Choirbook and the Caius Choirbook).\n\nThe Choirbook was compiled between approximately 1500 and 1505 for use at Eton College; its present binding dates from the mid 16th century. 126 folios remain of the original 224, including the index. In the original, there were a total of 93 separate compositions; however only 64 remain either complete or in part. Some of the 24 composers are known only because of their inclusion in the Eton Choirbook. John Browne has the most compositions (10), followed by Richard Davy (9) and Walter Lambe (8).\n\nStylistically, the music contained in the Eton Choirbook shows three phases in the development of early Renaissance polyphony in England. The first phase is represented by the music of Richard Hygons, William Horwood and Gilbert Banester. Most of the music of this early phase is polyphonic but non-imitative, with contrast achieved by alternation of full five-voice texture with sections sung by fewer voices. The second phase, which includes music by John Browne, Richard Davy and Walter Lambe, uses imitation, cantus firmus techniques, and frequent cross-relations (a feature which was to become a distinctive sound in early Tudor polyphony). The final phase represented in the choirbook includes music by William Cornysh and Robert Fayrfax, composed around 1500. Points of imitation are frequent, cantus firmus techniques disappear, and in general the sound of the music is more Continental.\n\nAll of the compositions in the book are sacred vocal music in Latin. According to the index, it initially contained 93 works. However, part of its content was lost and only 64 works have survived, a few of them incomplete. They consist of:\n\nThe following inventory represents the contents as enumerated by the index, with folio numbers for the works that survive.\n\nThe composers represented in the manuscript are: John Browne (10 works), Richard Davy (9), Walter Lambe (8), Robert Wilkinson (7), William Cornysh (5), William Horwood (4), Robert Fayrfax (2), John Fawkyner (2), Nicholas Huchyn (2), Hugh Kellyk (2), Edmund Turges (2), Gilbert Banester, Brygeman (1), Robert Hacomplaynt (1), John Hampton (1), Holynborne (1), Richard Hygons (1), Nesbet (1), Edmund Sturton (1), John Sutton (1), Sygar (1) and William Stratford (1).\n\nOther composers as Baldwyn, John Dunstable and Mychelson also appear in the index, but their works were lost.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The school is under the trusteeship of the Cardinal Hume Academies Trust. Its current Headmaster is Martin Tissot.\n\nBishop Douglass opened with Voluntary Aided status as a mixed secondary modern Roman Catholic school in Hamilton Road in 1963. In 1969 it merged with the independent Manor House Convent School in the nearby East End Road, which thereafter housed the sixth form of the expanded school. New buildings were added in Hamilton Road in 1969, 1973, 1976 and 1982, when there were 1,140 pupils on the roll. \n\nThe founding headmaster, Michael Caulfield, was at the time of his appointment the youngest of any school in the UK. He was succeeded by his deputy, John Meadows in the early 1990s, who retired in 2001. After a year with a temporary head and the school was faced with closure, Angela Murphy became the school's first headmistress in 2003. At the time of Murphy's appointment in 2003 the school was under 'special measures'. \n\nSince this date standards have consistently improved. Bishop Douglass was taken out of Special Measures following HMI Inspection in December 2005 and in its most recent Ofsted Inspection the following comments were given “a Good school of which students, parents, staff and governors are proud of” \n\nIn 2007, the School was granted Specialist Science College status, and was renewed in 2010. Under the Academies Act 2010, in 2016, Bishop Douglass became an Academy under the trusteeship of the Cardinal Hume Academies Trust. The school's current Headmaster, former pupil Martin Tissot, is also Headmaster of the other schools in the Trust - St George's Roman Catholic Secondary School in Maida Vale and St Thomas More Catholic School, Wood Green.\n\nThe pupils study Religious Education, Mathematics, Science, English Language and Literature, Spanish, French, History, Geography, Music, Art, Physical Education, Drama, Technology, ICT and Citizenship. The pupils carry on their selected GCSE subjects to Key Stage Four where additional subjects such as Sociology, Fine Art, Graphic Design, Business Studies and Computer Science are available. By Key Stage 4, the Science GCSEs are separated into Biology, Chemistry and Physics.\n\nAt sixth form, pupils choose A level subjects, including many traditional subjects, which they can continue from GCSE, such as Mathematics, Natural Sciences, English Literature and Philosophy as well as new subjects, such as Psychology, Engineering, Theology and Economics.\n\nFrom the founding of the school until 1969 the school uniform was light grey and white. When the school merged with Manor House Convent School, the uniform was From the founding of the school until 1969 the school uniform was grey. When the school became a comprehensive, at the time of the merger with Manor House Convent, until 2001, the Bishop Douglass uniform for girls consisted of a long royal blue skirt, grey V-neck jumper and a royal blue blazer. This would be worn with a blouse of the same colour as the house they were in. The girl's uniform blazer was originally collarless and double breasted. In the 1990s, it became a standard jacket similar to the boy's uniform. Originally, a navy bow-tie was worn with the blouse, but this was abandoned around 1974, at around the same time that the summer dress in blue and white dog tooth check was discontinued. Prior to 1977, first year girl students (\"Discovery Year\") wore a navy blue \"gym slip\" dress with their house blouse, rather than the skirt. The boys' uniform consisted of dark grey trousers, a white shirt, a grey V-neck jumper and royal blue blazer. This would be worn with a blue tie with stripes of the same colour as their house. The Sixth Form uniform for girls was navy skirt and navy sweater with a white blouse and for the boys it was black trousers, black sweater, black jacket and white shirt. The sixth form tie for boys was black, with the school emblem stitched in white.renewed to its current form, defined by its distinctive Royal Blue. It consists of a white shirt, a royal blue v-neck jumper, worn in the winter, and a royal blue blazer, bearing the emblem of the school. Girls wear a Royal Blue and basil green kilt, or may choose dark trousers, which were allowed after 2001. Boys wear dark trousers. All pupils wear a tie of colour corresponding to the colour of their house \"(see House colours below)\". Sixth form students wear a dark blazer, dark trousers or skirts (for girls), a white inner shirt and a striped white and black tie.\n\nIn 2001, a new uniform was implemented, the most noticeable change being in the new girls' uniform: a green Douglass Tartan Kilt, a white shirt, a royal blue blazer and a blue tie with stripes of the same colour as their house. A new option was that the girls were now allowed to wear black trousers instead of the skirt. The boys' uniform remained the same except for a darker shade of blue for their blazers.\n\nBefore the merger with Manor House Covent there were four houses: Bourne, Godfrey, Griffen and Hindsley. After the merger, a further two were established. Each house is named after a Christian Martyr, canonised by the Roman Catholic Church and has a distinctive colour which pupils of the house wear on their uniform. Each House supports its chosen social causes, ideas and charities. Inter-house competitions, such as poetry, chess, art and sport, take place throughout the academic year. \n\n\"HouseColours\": Campion , Fisher , Line , More , Owen , Ward \n\nAdditionally, there are two houses that do not bear the name of Catholic Saints nor colours: All-Saints and Southwell. These houses were introduced after 2013, primarily for administrative purposes, to allow for the expansion of the sixth form and are only used in the sixth form.\n\nIn addition to school houses, for many years the form years were named. First year students were classified as \"Discovery\" Year students in recognition of their new status in the school. Second year was named \"Exploration\"; the third year was \"Understanding\"; the fourth year was \"Preparation\" - as they prepared for their examination years; and the fifth year was \"Appreciation\" - a somewhat arrogant statement that the students were appreciating all the school had done for them. The sixth form was named Lower and Upper Sixth years. The naming convention was abandoned in 2002.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1791439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791439", "title": "Fortismere School", "text": "Fortismere School\n\nFortismere School (simply referred to as Fortismere) is an 11–18 mixed, comprehensive, foundation secondary school and sixth form in Muswell Hill, London, Greater London, England.\n\nIn 2016, it was ranked by \"The Sunday Times\" as the 12th best comprehensive school in the country. In its most recent Ofsted inspection, it was rated \"Outstanding\" and is the highest-performing comprehensive school in the borough.\n\nTollington Park College, a private educational establishment for boys, was founded by William Brown in 1879 in Tollington Park, London N4. Rapid population growth around Muswell Hill created the need for a new school. Campbell Brown, the founder's son, established Tollington Boys School in Tetherdown, Muswell Hill in 1901. Brown then opened Tollington High School for Girls in nearby Collingwood Avenue in 1910. In 1919 both schools were purchased by the local education authority. Aside from the senior management, the two schools operated independently.\n\nAfter World War II, this became a state grammar school and the attached preparatory school became Tetherdown Primary School (this moved from the site in 1958 when it exchanged premises with the girls' grammar school). In 1958 the current building was erected and Tollington High School for Girls and Tollington Grammar School for Boys merged to become Tollington Grammar School (co-ed). In 1955, William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School (named after a local councillor) opened on an adjoining site in Creighton Avenue, taking the senior classes from Coldfall Council School. It offered extended classes from 1961.\n\nWith the introduction of comprehensive education in Haringey in 1967, Tollington Grammar School and William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School were merged to form Creighton School. Charles Loades, head of William Grimshaw since 1958, became head, remaining until his retirement in 1974.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Creighton School became the centrepiece of a Labour Party educational experiment. Situated in the middle-class, largely white suburb of Muswell Hill it was decided to integrate a large number of Afro-Caribbean and other ethnic minority children into the school from distant parts of the borough in an attempt to maximise education choice and social interaction – a policy based heavily on the United States' then-current system of desegregation busing. In 1975, before this new intake had worked through the school, around one-third of the Sixth Form was either a first-generation immigrant, or had a surname of Cypriot or Asian origin. The head who was charged with overseeing this experiment was Molly Hattersley, the wife of Labour Party minister Roy Hattersley.\n\nAs a part of the continuing debate about comprehensive schools, Creighton School became the subject of a series of articles in the \"Sunday Times\" and a subsequent book by Hunter Davies,\"The Creighton Report\", illustrated by an A-Level Photography student at the school and the Sunday Times photojournalist Frank Herrmann.\n\nAfter further reorganisation, Creighton School and another comprehensive, Alexandra Park School, were combined under the new name of Fortismere School. It opened in September 1983 and gained Technology College status in 1997, which lasted until it became a foundation school. \n\nIn the summer of 2006, the school's governors and recently appointed head teacher Aydin Önaç proposed to change the school's status to that of a foundation school. The governors argued that the increased autonomy from the LEA provided by foundation status would be beneficial to the school, while critics argued that the proposal was an attack on the school's comprehensive nature and would lead to a reduction in provision for pupils with special educational needs. On 1 September 2007, Fortismere became a foundation school – despite opposition from 70 per cent of parents and a petition from students demanding to be consulted on the changes.\n\nIn September 2009, Önaç altered the comprehensive school's entry criteria, reserving places for musically gifted children – a policy described as 'elitist', favouring wealthier parents and more academic children.\n\nÖnaç was also criticised for a policy towards children with special needs. Ten children were affected by the policy, which reduced personnel in what had been a well-staffed special needs department, and breached legal requirements concerning the hours of support provided to children. Parents sought a judicial review of Önaç's approach to special needs provision, but in December 2009 he resigned from his post soon after the legal action started. The action was subsequently discontinued and special needs provision improved after Önaç's departure.\n\nUnder the leadership of headteacher Helen Glass, Fortismere adopted a vertical tutoring system in September 2012. Under the new system students are sorted into tutor groups that consist of students from Years 7–11. The school also introduced a college system. Following an online vote, it was decided that the new 'colleges' would be named after the Wonders of the World. There are six 'colleges': Alexandria, Ephesus, Colosseum, Rhodes, Olympia and Petra.\n\nThe school occupies extensive grounds a little west of the centre of Muswell Hill. There are two main buildings on the site, the North Wing focuses mainly on English, Modern Languages and the Arts and South Wing which mainly focuses on Maths, Sciences and Humanities with a separate science block. The Wings are separated by playing fields, a sports hall, astroturf and tennis courts.\n\nA sixth form building is adjacent to the South Wing, situated just inside the Tetherdown entrance. There are main entrances in Twyford Avenue (South Wing), Tetherdown (South Wing), and Creighton Avenue (North Wing).\n\nThe secondary school part of the Blanche Nevile School for Deaf Children is located on the site of Fortismere School. The two schools maintain a strong partnership and are connected to the same computer server.\nEach Saturday Farsi is taught to a wide age spectrum. \n\nThe instrument of government requires 12 governors: one local authority governor; four parent governors elected by the parents; one staff governor; two partnership governors; three co-opted and the headteacher. There are four sub-committees: Curriculum, Physical Resources, Resources and Admissions.\n\nAs a foundation school, Fortismere sets its own admission procedure. The duty to have a fair admissions procedure was defined by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. All students are funded by their local authority.\n\nFor year 7 entry it has a published admissions number of 243, which is 8 form entry. Applications are made through the local authority transfer procedure system. The school is responsible for defining the order of priority when more than 243 children apply.\n\nPupils with a Statement of Special Educational Needs or an Education, Health and Care Plan which names the school, are automatically offered a place. Places then go to Looked after children/previously looked after children, then to children with exceptional medical or social need, then to children with siblings in the school, and children of members of staff. Finally other children are selected by the distance they live from the reception area in the South Wing building.\n\nYear 12 entry is dependent on students having five C-grade GCSE passes or better, including English or Maths. For academic courses they must have the equivalent of five B-grade passes in Maths, English and the subjects they wish to study and any other published requirement. For the applied courses the bar is set at C-grade passes. Academic students are expected to pass the equivalent AS level exam before advancing into year 13. \n\nThere are a minimum of 50 extra places available for students transferring from other schools.\n\nAs of 2010, the school follows the National Curriculum in Years 7–11 and offers a broad range of GCSEs (national exams taken by students aged 14–16) and A-levels (national exams taken by pupils aged 16–18). The school has no affiliation with a particular religious denomination, but religious education is given throughout the school, and students may opt to take the subject as part of their GCSE course.\n\nKey Stage 3 of the National Curriculum is covered during years 7, 8 and 9, though most subjects will commence using Key Stage 4 (i.e. GCSE) material during year 9.\nThe 'Core Key Stage 3 Subjects' are English, Mathematics and Science. The Foundation Subjects are Art & Design, Geography, History, Music, Physical Education, Technology, Information Technology, Modern Languages. Additional Subjects are Religious Education, Drama and Wellbeing. The five cross-curricular themes are Careers, Wellbeing, Economic and industrial awareness, Environmental education and Health education.\n\nKey Stage 4 students study up to 10 GCSEs, depending on their ability. There are four core subjects studied by all students and four options delivered by a varied options system. This allows for the study of three separate sciences, as well as two languages and a range of courses, including vocational options. French, German, Spanish and Mandarin are offered. \nThe English Baccalaureate will be awarded to any pupil who secures good GCSE or iGCSE passes (C and\nabove) in all of the following subject areas: English, Maths, two sciences (which includes computer science), a foreign language, history or geography. This qualification is of particular interest to Russell Group universities.\nIn addition to the subjects studied at Key Stage 3, Business Studies, Economics, ICT to include ECDL, Media Studies, Music Technology, Sports Studies, Health and Fitness, Photography, Engineering, Fashion and Textiles, Food and Catering, Performing Arts, Princes trust (Certificate), and Sociology are offered.\n\nStudents who opt to stay on after sixteen study for BTEC or A levels. The following courses are offered Biology, Chemistry, Classical Civilisation, Computer Science, Drama & Theatre Studies, Economics, English, Film Studies, Fine Art, Geography, History, Mandarin Pre-U, Maths, Media Studies, French, Spanish, German, Music. Music Technology, philosophy, Photography, Physics, Politics, Product Design, Psychology, Sociology. Entry to each course is dependent on GCSE exam grades. Students who fail to obtain a good AS-level pass, are advised to retake it before continuing the A level course in year 13.\n\nSchool clubs and societies include various language clubs, sport clubs, and musical activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

He wrote novels, critiques, a play, and poetry. His literary works were noted for their dreamlike abstraction, elegant style and refined vocabulary. He was close to the surrealist movement, in particular its leader André Breton.\n\nGracq first studied in Paris at the \"Lycée Henri IV\", where he earned his baccalauréat. He then entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1930, later studying at the \"École libre des sciences politiques\" (Sciences Po.), both schools of the University of Paris at the time.\n\nIn 1932, he read André Breton's \"Nadja\", which deeply influenced him. His first novel, \"The Castle of Argol\", is dedicated to that surrealist writer, to whom he devoted a whole book in 1948.\n\nIn 1936, he joined the French Communist Party but quit the party in 1939 after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was signed.\n\nDuring the Second World War, he was a prisoner of war in Silesia with other officers of the French Army. One of the friendships he formed there was with author and literary critic Armand Hoog, who later described Gracq as a passionate individualist and ferociously anti-Vichy.\n\nIn 1950, he published a fierce attack on contemporary literary culture and literary prizes in the review \"Empédocle\" titled \"La Littérature à l'estomac\". When he won the \"Prix Goncourt\" for \"The Opposing Shore\" (\"Le Rivage des Syrtes\") the following year, he remained consistent with his criticism and refused the prize.\n\nGracq taught history and geography in secondary school (high school) until he retired in 1970.\n\nIn 1979, he wrote the foreword to a re-edition of the \"Journal de l'analogiste\" (1954) by Suzanne Lilar, a work he called a \"sumptuous initiation to poetry\" (\"\"une initiation somptueuse à la poésie\"\").\n\nIn 1989, Gracq's work was published by the \"Bibliothèque de la Pléiade\". He remained distant from major literary events and faithful to his first publisher, José Corti.\n\nGracq lived a quiet life in his native town of Saint-Florent-le-Vieil, on the banks of the Loire River. On 22 December 2007, a couple of days after suffering a dizzy spell, he died at the age of 97 in a hospital in Angers.\n\n\"The Opposing Shore\" (\"Le Rivage des Syrtes\", 1951) is Julien Gracq's most famous novel.\n\nA novel of waiting, it is set in an old fortress close to a sea which defines the ancestral border between the stagnant principality of Orsenna and the territory of its archenemy, the mysterious Farghestan. Its lonely characters are caught in a no man's land, waiting for something to happen and wondering whether something should be done to bring about change, particularly when change may mean the death of civilisations.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her principal topics of interest are media, technology, and the global circulation of images. Steyerl holds a PhD in Philosophy from the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. She is currently a professor of New Media Art at the Berlin University of the Arts, where she co-founded the Research Center for Proxy Politics, together with Vera Tollmann and Boaz Levin .\n\nSteyerl was born on 1 January 1966 in Munich and attended the Japan Institute of the Moving Image. She later studied at the University of Television and Film Munich. Steyerl was deeply influenced by Harun Farocki, although she has cited her former professor, the noted film historian Helmut Färber, as having a more direct influence on her work.\n\nIn 2004 she participated in Manifesta 5, The European Biennial of Contemporary Art. She has also participated in the 2008 Shanghai Biennale and the 2010 Gwangju and Taipei biennials. In 2007, her film \"Lovely Andrea\" was exhibited as a part of documenta 12 in Kassel, Germany. In 2013 her work was included in the Venice Biennale and the Istanbul Biennial. In 2015, her work was included in the German pavilion at the Venice Biennale. In 2019, it was featured in the Arsenale of the Venice Biennale. \n\nHito Steyerl’s work pushes the boundary of traditional video, often obscuring what is real beneath many layers of metaphors and satirical humor. She referred to her piece, \"Red Alert\", as \"the outer limit of video\". It consisted of three monitors playing a video of pure red, representing \"Lovely Andrea\", as well as symbolizing the extreme danger and lust that had become a normality.\n\nHer work concerns topics of militarization, surveillance migration, the role of media in globalization, and the dissemination of images and the culture surrounding it. Steyerl has pushed both the role and the label of fine artist, which is demonstrated through her tendencies and interests in engaging the presentational context of art. Her work is developed from research, interviews, and the collection of found images, culminating in pedagogically-oriented work in the realm of forensic documentaries and dream-like montages.\n\nIn 2017, Steyerl was listed as the number one most influential person in the contemporary art world.\n\nIn recent years, Steyerl's work has expanded to confront the status of images in an increasingly digital world, institutions (including museums), networks, and labor. Her work has addressed the topic of corporate sponsorship by engaging with institutions, including \"Drill\" in 2019 at the Park Avenue Armory in New York, for which Steyerl revealed histories connecting the building hosting the exhibition with the founding of the National Rifle Association. On the topic of private funding, Steyerl has expressed: 'Ultimately, it will be important to move beyond protests against individuals and try to frame the problems more generally in terms of a new charter for the art world: a set of principles that include different aspects, like pay, sponsorship, governance, transparency standards, representation, sustainability, and so on, like a new deal for museums.'

These lessons include how to 1. Make something invisible for a camera, 2. Be invisible in plain sight, 3. Become invisible by becoming a picture, 4. Be invisible by disappearing, and 5. Become invisible by merging into a world made of pictures. Many of these methods may seem impossible. \"How Not to Be Seen\" is a satirical take on instructional films. Much of the video also deals with surveillance and digital imagery: for example, figures in all black dance around as \"pixels,\" and aerial photography features frequently. Thus, \"How Not to be Seen\" becomes a tutorial for invisibility in an age of intense hypersurveillance. \n\n30:00 minutes\n\n\"Liquidity, Inc.,\" (from 2014) consists of a video and a seating/backdrop installation.

It gained broader popularity after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US, which was the first major incident to be covered by TVN24. It is available over all digital platforms in Poland (Cyfrowy Polsat and nc+) as well as in most cable networks and some networks in other countries, including USA (Dish Network) and Germany. The audio portion of the channel can be streamed on the internet.\n\nOn February 6, 2018, the European Commission approved the deal. Since Liberty Global, which operates pay television services in Poland under the UPC Polska brand, is a major shareholder in Discovery Inc, the EU required that Discovery ensure the continued availability of TVN24 and TVN24 BiS to third-party TV providers.\n\nThe TVN24 team is also responsible for the TVN flagship newscast, Fakty TVN, and for the weather and lifestyle channel TVN Meteo Active.

On January 14, 2009, the PiS political committee decided to suspend the boycott. On this day, Grażyna Gęsicka took part in the TVN24 program.

The reason for this was the lack of invitation for members of his party to the series of debates before the parliamentary elections in 2011. Despite the lack of changes in the decision, the leader of the group often appeared in this station. TVN24 is very often criticized by Law and Justice politicians as well as conservative journalists and journalists who accuse the station of bias, manipulation, and favoring politicians and activists of the Civic Platform, .Modern and the Committee for the Defense of Democracy. In 2015, the then candidate for the presidential election of Poland and the founder and leader of the Kukiz'15 movement, Paweł Kukiz accused TVN24, of making propaganda. On January 20, 2018, the National Movement politicians repeatedly bias the TV material prepared for the \"Duma and Modernity\" association by the \"Supervisor\" broadcast on TVN24 .\n\n"}

Tour is an American nanotechnologist and both Professor of Materials Science and NanoEngineering, and Professor of Computer Science at Rice University in Houston, Texas, United States.\n\nTour received degrees from Syracuse University (BS, 1981), Purdue University (PhD, 1986) and completed postdoctoral work at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1986–1987) and Stanford University (1987–1988).\n\nJames Tour's work has spanned organic chemistry and materials science with a focus on carbon materials chemistry and nanotechnology. Tour has over 700 research publications and over 130 patent families, with an H-index of 144 with total citations over 100,000. \n\nHis work on carbon materials is broad and encompasses fullerene purification, composites, conductive inks for radio frequencies identification tags, carbon nanoreporters for identifying oil downhole, graphene synthesis from cookies and insects, graphitic electronic devices, carbon particle drug delivery for treatment of traumatic brain injury, the merging of 2D graphene with 1D nanotubes to make a conjoined hybrid material, a new graphene-nanotube 2D material called rebar graphene, graphene quantum dots from coal, gas barrier composites, graphene nanoribbon deicing films, supercapacitors and battery device structures, and water splitting to H and O using metal chalcogenides. His work with the synthesis of graphene oxide, its mechanism of formation, and its use in capturing radionuclides from water is extensive. Tour has developed oxide based electronic memories that can also be transparent and built onto flexible substrates. More recently, he has been using porous metal structures to make renewable energy devices including batteries and supercapacitors, as well as electronic memories. \n\nTour worked in molecular electronics and molecular switching molecules. He pioneered the development of the Nanocar, single-molecule vehicles with four independently rotating wheels, axles, and light-activated motors. Tour was the first to show that Feringa-based motors can be used to move a molecule on a surface using light as opposed to electric current from an STM tip. His early career focused upon the synthesis of conjugated polymers and precise oligomers. \n\nTour has also been involved in scientific outreach, such as NanoKids, an interactive learning DVD to teach children fundamentals of chemistry and physics. He also developed SciRave, a Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero package to teach science concepts to middle school and elementary school students. and much work on carbon nanotubes and graphene. \n\nIn the \"Scientific American\" article \"Better Killing Through Chemistry\", which appeared a few months after the September 11 attacks, Tour highlighted the ease of obtaining chemical weapon precursors in the United States.\n\nTour was inducted into the National Academy of Inventors in 2015. He was named among \"The 50 most Influential Scientists in the World Today\" by TheBestSchools.org in 2014. Tour was named \"Scientist of the Year\" by \"R&D Magazine\" in 2013. Tour won the ACS Nano Lectureship Award from the American Chemical Society in 2012. Tour was ranked one of the top 10 chemists in the world over the past decade by Thomson Reuters in 2009. That year, he was also made a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Other notable awards won by Tour include the 2008 Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology, the NASA Space Act Award in 2008 for his development of carbon nanotube reinforced elastomers, the Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award from the American Chemical Society (ACS) for his achievements in organic chemistry in 2007, the Small Times magazine's Innovator of the Year Award in 2006, the Southern Chemist of the Year Award from ACS in 2005, the Honda Innovation Award for Nanocars in 2005, the NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1990, and the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award in 1989. In 2005, Tour's journal article \"Directional Control in Thermally Driven Single-Molecule Nanocars\" was ranked the Most Accessed Journal Article by the American Chemical Society. Tour has twice won the George R. Brown Award for Superior Teaching at Rice University in 2007 and 2012. In 2016, Tour was listed as an ISI highly cited researcher.\n\nIn 2001, Tour was one of a small number of nationally prominent researchers among the five hundred scientists and engineers whose names appeared on the Discovery Institute's controversial petition, \"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism\". The petition states \"we are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.\" The two-sentence statement has been widely used by its sponsor, the Discovery Institute, and some of their supporters in a national campaign to discredit evolution and to promote intelligent design.\n\n\"To those who are disconcerted or even angered that I signed a statement back in 2001\" he responded \"I have been labeled as an Intelligent Design (ID) proponent. I am not. I do not know how to use science to prove intelligent design although some others might. I am sympathetic to the arguments on the matter and I find some of them intriguing, but the scientific proof is not there, in my opinion. So I prefer to be free of that ID label.\"\n\nHe explained that he felt the explanations offered by evolution are incomplete, and he found it hard to believe that nature can produce the machinery of cells through random processes. On his website, he writes that \"From what I can see, microevolution is a fact\" and \"there is no argument regarding microevolution. The core of the debate for me, therefore, is the extrapolation of microevolution to macroevolution.\"\n\nTour has written extensively on his viewpoint that all scientific studies to date are wholly inadequate to account for life. In multiple essays in the \"Inference: International Review of Science\", Tour argues from a chemical perspective that the molecules needed for life - nucleotides, carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids - are too complex to have been formed by probabilistic chance. Despite this, he said he remains open-minded about evolution but maintains that evolution of complex systems remains pure conjecture. He was quoted as saying \"I respect that work\" and being open to the possibility that future research will complete the explanations.\n\nIn Lee Strobel's book \"The Case For Faith\" - the following commentary is attributed to Tour: \"I build molecules for a living, I can't begin to tell you how difficult that job is. I stand in awe of God because of what he has done through his creation. Only a rookie who knows nothing about science would say science takes away from faith. If you really study science, it will bring you closer to God.\"\n\n"}

It was founded as Pearl River County Agricultural High School in 1909 and became the first junior college in Mississippi in 1921.\n\nPearl River County Agricultural High School (PRCAHS) was the result of the Mississippi Agricultural High School Law of 1908, making it the nation's first state-funded system of agricultural high schools. The law was found to be in violation of the separate but equal clause in the state's constitution by the state's Supreme Court late in 1909 when no equal opportunity was offered for the state's African-American children. The overturned law caused all but three of the twenty original agricultural high schools in the state to close, since state funding was no longer available. Pearl River County citizens came to the school's rescue, however, when private citizens secured a loan from \na local bank to fund the school until the Mississippi Legislature could pass a new law which made opportunity for both races.\n\nClasses began on September 8, 1909 under the direction of Professor T.M. Kelly. The entire boarding high school was located in one three-story building erected on of land on the edge of the county's seat, Poplarville. Classrooms and the cafeteria was located on the building's first floor, while the girls' dormitory occupied the second floor and the boys' dormitory occupied the third floor.\n\nPRCAHS, under the supervision of James Andrew Huff, added freshman college classes to the curriculum to the school in 1921-22, making Pearl River College the first 2-year public institution in Mississippi. Pearl River College continued to lead the way by the addition of sophomore classes in 1925-26.\n\nPearl River College has since expanded to include four locations, the main campus in Poplarville, the Forrest County Center and Lowery Woodall Advanced Technology Center in Hattiesburg, MS, and the Hancock Center in Waveland, MS.\n\nIn August 2005, PRCC's Poplarville campus suffered an estimated $40–50 million in damage at the hand of Hurricane Katrina. This included severe structural damage to the auditorium wing of Moody Hall, the state's oldest instructional building on a junior college campus, and M. R. White Coliseum, the college's sports arena. Both the auditorium wing of Moody Hall and the entire sports arena were razed for student safety. A new M. R. White Coliseum was built on the same site, and the Ethel Holden Brownstone Center for the Arts was built to replace Moody Hall Auditorium. Most of the roofs on campus had to be replaced due to the storm, and many buildings had to undergo extensive mold remediation. The Hancock Center, on the Gulf Coast, was completely gutted by the massive tidal surge. The main campus was shut down for three weeks due to damages and the Hancock Center was shut down for four weeks.\n\nThe school has the following residential facilities:\n\nFor men: Hancock Hall, Huff Hall, Lamar Hall, Marion Hall, and Pearl River Hall.\n\nFor women: Forrest Hall, Holden Hall, and Moody Hall.\n\nPearl River's athletic teams are called the Wildcats, and the football team won four straight Mississippi Association of Community & Junior Colleges (MACJC) championships (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006) since head coach Tim Hatten took over the program in 2002. Pearl River also won the 2004 National Championship of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) with the help of three NJCAA All-Americans, including wide receiver Larry Brackins, who was selected 155th overall by the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2005 NFL Draft; quarterback Jimmy Oliver, and offensive lineman Matt Lott. PRCC played for the 2006 NJCAA title in the Pilgrim's Pride Bowl Classic in Mt. Pleasant, Tex., but lost to Blinn College (Tex.) 19-6.\n\nBrackins was a member of the Philadelphia Soul of the Arena Football League, and the practice squad for the NFL New York Jets. While former Wildcat receiver Donavan Morgan plays with the AFL's Chicago Rush franchise after brief NFL stints with the New York Jets, Houston Texans, and Buffalo Bills. Larry Kendrick, Brackins' 2003 Wildcat teammate, signed on with the Ole Miss Rebels following the one-year stint at Pearl River and was an NJCAA All-American as a wide receiver and a defensive back, as well as being named the NJCAA's Male Athlete of the Year in 2003. Kendrick currently plays in the Arena 2 league.\n\nPRCC's 2006 state title marked its 19th in school history, which is a record for Mississippi community colleges. Oliver guided the Wildcats to their 2004 and 2005 titles and earned NJCAA \"Offensive Player of the Year\" honors both seasons, including All-American accolades. Oliver played two seasons with Jackson State University, guiding the Tigers to the 2007 SWAC championship.\n\nPearl River won four MACJC state championships during the 2003-2004 school year in football, men's basketball, women's soccer, and baseball. PRCC also won the 2005 MACJC women's soccer championship.\n\nThree former Wildcat players are currently in the NFL, including San Diego Charger wide receiver Demetrius Byrd (who also won the 2008 BCS National Championship with the LSU Tigers after playing for PRCC), Washington Redskin defensive linemen Cornelius Griffin, and Oakland Raider defensive back Hiram Eugene. Former PRCC basketball standout James Singleton played two seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and currently plays for the Washington Wizards.\n\nIn 2010 PRCC Men's soccer team signed a professional from Scotland, Curtis Sangbarani.\n\nThere are several student organizations available at the different campus locations.\n\nThe Poplarville Campus offers:\nBaptist Student Union,\nCollege Republicans, \nDECA,\nFellowship of Christian Athletes,\nHonors Institute,\nPhi Theta Kappa,\nPRCC Gaming and Strategy Club,\nRiver Navigators,\nSkills USA,\nSTEM Club (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics),\nStudent Government Association,\nStudent Nurses Association,\nWesley Foundation, Wildcat Watch, and \nYoung Americans for Liberty.\n\nThe Forrest County Center offers: \nAmerican Dental Hygienists’ Association,\nBaptist Student Union,\nFellowship of Christian Athletes,\nForrest County Center Science Club,\nHistory and Humanities Club,\nMu Alpha Theta,\nPhi Theta Kappa-Beta Tau Gamma Chapter,\nSigma Kappa Delta, National English Honor Society, and\nStudent Government Association.\n\nThe Hancock Center offers: Baptist Student Union and Phi Theta Kappa.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1791503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791503", "title": "Atomic Energy Act of 1946", "text": "Atomic Energy Act of 1946\n\nThe Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) determined how the United States would control and manage the nuclear technology it had jointly developed with its World War II allies, the United Kingdom and Canada. Most significantly, the Act ruled that nuclear weapon development and nuclear power management would be under civilian, rather than military control, and established the United States Atomic Energy Commission for this purpose.\n\nIt was sponsored by Senator Brien McMahon, a Democrat from Connecticut, who chaired the United States Senate Special Committee on Atomic Energy, and whose hearings in late 1945 and early 1946 led to the fine tuning and passing of the Act. The Senate passed the Act unanimously through voice vote, and it passed the House of Representatives 265–79. Signed into law by President Harry S. Truman on August 1, 1946, it went into effect on January 1, 1947, and the Atomic Energy Commission assumed responsibility for nuclear energy from the wartime Manhattan Project.\n\nThe Act was subsequently amended to promote private development of nuclear energy under the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program in 1954. In restricting the access to nuclear information to other countries, it created a rift between the United States and its allies, particularly Britain and Canada, which had participated in the Manhattan Project. This resulted in cumbersome command and control arrangements, and in Britain developing its own nuclear weapons. The Act was amended in 1958 to allow the United States to share information with its close allies.\n\nNuclear weapons were developed during World War II by the wartime Manhattan Project. Key scientists working on the project anticipated that their development would have wide-ranging implications. However the project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves Jr., was reluctant to spend project funds on activities beyond those required to win the war. Nonetheless, Arthur Compton of the Metallurgical Project in Chicago commissioned a report on post-war nuclear energy, and the Military Policy Committee, the Manhattan Project's governing body, commissioned a similar study by Richard Tolman. Both reports called for a comprehensive, government-supported nuclear energy program, with military, scientific, and industrial aspects.\n\nIn July 1944, Vannevar Bush, James B. Conant and Irvin Stewart produced a proposal for domestic legislation to control nuclear energy. Conant submitted this to the Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson in September 1944, and then to the Interim Committee, a body created by President Harry S. Truman in May 1945 to supervise, regulate and control nuclear energy until such a time as Congress created a permanent body to do so. In June 1945, the Interim Committee asked George L. Harrison, an assistant to Stimson and a member of the committee, to prepare legislation.\n\nHarrison brought in two experienced Harvard Law School-educated War Department lawyers, Brigadier General Kenneth Royall and William L. Marbury Jr. to take up the job of drafting the legislation. The legislation was based on Bush and Conant's proposal, and the organization that it proposed was based on the existing structure of the Manhattan Project. Their draft bill would have created a nine-man commission consisting of five civilian and four military members. It granted the commission broad powers to acquire property, operate facilities, conduct research, regulate all forms of nuclear energy and administer its own security, administrative and audit regimes.\n\nRoyall and Marbury envisaged nuclear energy being controlled by experts, with a minimum of political interference. The commissioners would be appointed for indefinite terms, and the President's power to remove them would be limited. They would be supported by four advisory boards, for military applications, industrial uses, research and medicine, the membership of which would be restricted to those with technical qualifications. Day-to-day running of the organization would be in the hands of an administrator and his deputy. The Royall–Marbury Bill was reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lifted the veil of secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project, Royall and Marbury were able to consult with the Attorney General, the Judge Advocate General and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The draft was sent to the President in August for circulation among, and comment from, affected government agencies. Only the State Department had objections, on the basis that it was still involved in trying to hammer out an international agreement on nuclear energy.\n\nOn October 3, 1945, the bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Andrew J. May from Kentucky, the chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, and in the Senate by Senator Edwin C. Johnson from Colorado, the ranking member of the Senate Military Affairs Committee. The bill was known as the May-Johnson Bill for its sponsors. May immediately had the bill referred to the Military Affairs Committee, which held hearings on October 9. Bush, Conant and Groves all testified before the committee. But in the Senate Military Affairs Committee, the bill was held up by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg.\n\nThere was a storm of criticism from scientists, particularly those at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Leó Szilárd and Harold Urey were particularly notable critics. The bill created a powerful administrator and deputy administrator, and specifically stated that they might be members of the armed forces. It was feared that they would dominate the part-time commissioners. The fact that the bill emphasized that the administrator had to keep the deputy fully informed further aroused suspicion that the administrator would be an Army officer and the deputy a Navy officer. The secrecy provisions also frightened many scientists; it contained severe penalties of up to ten years imprisonment and $10,000 in fines for security breaches. The \"Chicago Sun\" headline accused the War Department of attempting to railroad the legislation through Congress.\n\nLegislators found themselves in an unusual and uncomfortable situation. Nuclear weapons were terrifying, and the nature of nuclear energy was not widely understood. Because it was so new, there were no policies or precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments were absent. The scientists who had developed the new technology had never been vocal before, but suddenly were now. The victorious conclusion of World War II gave the armed forces enormous prestige, but there still remained the long-standing American distrust of standing armies, and the tradition of civilian control of the military.\n\nOn December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative bill on atomic energy, drafted by the Senate Military affairs Committee, which quickly became known as the McMahon Bill. This was initially a very liberal bill regarding the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson Bill also provided for civilian control. The McMahon Bill attempted to address the controversial aspects of the May-Johnson Bill. The number of commissioners was reduced to five, and they would serve full-time. No exemption was provided for serving military officers. An amendment specified that they have staggered terms of five years.\n\nWhile the bill was being debated, the news broke on February 16, 1946, of the defection of Igor Gouzenko in Canada, and the subsequent arrest of 22 people. The members of Congress debating the bill feared that \"atomic secrets\" were being systematically stolen by Soviet atomic spies. McMahon convened an executive session at which Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover, Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and Groves were called to appear. Groves revealed that the British physicist Alan Nunn May had passed information about the Manhattan Project to Soviet agents.\n\nThe more conservative elements in Congress now moved to toughen the act. Section 10, which was formerly titled \"Dissemination of Information\", now became \"Control of Information\". This new section contained the novel doctrine later described as \"born secret\" or \"classified at birth\". All information concerning the design, development and manufacture of nuclear weapons was \"restricted data\", and regardless of how it was derived or obtained, was considered classified unless it was specifically declassified. This restriction on free speech, covering an entire subject matter, is still enforced. The \"wall of secrecy\" set up by the Act meant that atomic energy research and development had to be conducted under the supervision of the Atomic Energy Commission.\n\nRepresentative Helen Gahagan Douglas, who sponsored the McMahon Bill in the House, vigorously defended the dissemination provisions of Section 10 against counterarguments. She dismissed objections that it would \"give away the secret of the bomb\", asserting that America's advantage in nuclear weapons could only be temporary, whereas the bill could perpetuate its lead in scientific research. An important addition, known as the Vandenberg Amendment, created a Military Liaison Committee to advise the commission on defense matters. Section 2 of the Act also created a General Advisory Committee, and a new Joint Committee on Atomic Energy to oversee the new organization.\nThe Senate passed the Act unanimously through voice vote on June 1, 1946. Considerable political maneuvering was required before it was passed by the House 265–79 on July 20. A compromise bill was then agreed to by both houses on July 26. Truman signed the compromise bill into law as the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 on August 1, 1946. When it went into effect at midnight on January 1, 1947, the newly created Atomic Energy Commission assumed responsibility for nuclear energy from the wartime Manhattan Project.\n\nAn important omission from the Atomic Energy of 1946 was any mention of non-governmental use of nuclear energy, since military applications overshadowed all others at the time. The restrictions of the act related to secrecy, the control of fissile materials, the ownership of patents and the operation of production facilities placed a number of legal roadblocks in the way of private nuclear power stations.\n\nThis was at odds with the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program, and resulted in pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures on the nuclear weapons program. In 1953 the Atomic Energy Commission presented a set of draft amendments to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy for consideration. After some debate, this resulted in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.\n\nThe Atomic Energy Act of 1954 proved insufficient in its objective of encouraging privately built and run nuclear reactors. A series of accidents with research reactors, including partial core meltdowns, made private companies cautious, and reluctant to become involved with nuclear energy without protection from liability. This led to the Price–Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act of 1957, which capped private liability for nuclear accidents, while providing for adequate compensations for accident victims.\n\nImplementing the McMahon Act created a substantial rift between United States and Britain. The new control of \"restricted data\" prevented the United States' allies from receiving any information, despite the fact that the British and Canadian governments, before contributing technology and manpower to the Manhattan Project, had made agreements with the United States about the post-war sharing of nuclear technology. Those agreements had been formalized in the 1943 Quebec Agreement. In the case of the United Kingdom, these were developed further in the 1944 Hyde Park Agreement, which was signed by Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nThe Hyde Park Agreement was lost in Roosevelt's papers after his death, and until the American copy of the document was found American officials were puzzled when the British mentioned it. The Quebec Agreement was an executive agreement that only applied to the Roosevelt administration, and the Senate had not seen the document. McMahon told Churchill in 1952 that \"If we had seen this Agreement, there would have been no McMahon Act.\" The McMahon Act fueled resentment from British scientists and Churchill, and led to Britain developing its own nuclear weapons.\n\nLewis Strauss, the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, proposed in January 1958 that the President should be able to share nuclear information with allies that were making \"substantial and material contributions to the national defense and security\". In addition to its own nuclear weapons, Britain had hosted American Strategic Air Command nuclear bombers since 1948. Congress amended the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 in June 1958, and America and Britain again began sharing nuclear research under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.\n\nThe stipulations contained in the Act caused significant controversy during debates over NATO's military command structure. Both Striking Fleet Atlantic and the United States Sixth Fleet have never been allowed to be placed anywhere but directly under American commanding officers—the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic and Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe—because the dominant legal interpretation of the McMahon Act has been that nuclear striking forces cannot be controlled by non-US commanders. This was the reason for the formation of Striking Fleet Atlantic as an independent entity, instead of being operationally subordinated to the UK Admiral serving as Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Atlantic, in October–November 1952. This was also the reason why the Sixth Fleet, in its NATO guise as Naval Striking and Support Force, South, was placed under American control rather than Allied Forces Mediterranean when the European commands were agreed at the same time.\n\nA 2012 court decision concerning a state law attempting to shut down the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant affirmed that the Act gives the federal government exclusive authority over safety at nuclear power plants. This allowed Vermont Yankee to continue operating until it was voluntarily shut down by the owner for economic reasons in 2014.\n\n\n"}

L. Doctorow, loosely based on the lives, trial and execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Doctorow tells the story of Paul and Rochelle Isaacson (corollaries to the Rosenbergs) through the persons of their older son, Daniel, and his sister, Susan, who are college students deeply involved in 1960s politics.\n\nWriting his doctoral thesis ('The Book of Daniel'), a political genealogy of the American Old Left, Daniel Isaacson confronts his own personal relationship to that historical narrative by investigating the background to his parents' conviction and execution by the State, with some assistance from his adoptive parents (the Lewins). The dénouement is the revisiting, in flashback, of the death of his parents, Rochelle and Paul Isaacson, and, in due course, the death from nervous disorder (and attempted suicide) of his sister Susan. The novel closes as the library in which Daniel is working is closed by student protests. Doctorow closes his novel with a parody of lines from Chapter 12 of the Biblical Book of Daniel. This moment culminates a merger of the text's two primary levels of narrative concern: Daniel's self-conscious inability to find and tell his own truthful personal history, which mirrors the anxiety of the radical 1960s New Left to emerge from the failure of the Communist Party to achieve its revolutionary potential in the 1950s. \n\nThe book is written in four parts, and in each Daniel is the principal narrator; the narrative moves fluidly and rapidly between 1967 ('the present') and flashback (to the late 40s/early 50s), and between first and third person:\n\nThe book was adapted as a film, \"Daniel\" (1983), directed by Sidney Lumet. Lumet somewhat changes the emphasis of the novel, to concentrate more on the 1940s left-wing politics of the parents. This was an era of which Lumet had close personal experience – the film is generally less well-regarded than the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Use of Shikharji as a tourist destination also impacts on the religious beliefs of the Jain.\n\nThe pilgrimage to Shikharji is a round trip of 27 km through the Madhuban forest. The section from Gandharva Nala stream to the summit is the most sacred to Jains. The pilgrimage is made on foot or by a litter or \"doli\" carried by a \"doliwallah\" along a concrete paved track. Along the track are shrines to each of the twenty four \"tirthankaras\" and vendors of tea, coffee, water, fruits and snacks.\n\nThere is an option for parikrama of the entire Parasnath Hill, a pilgrimage of . The parikrama path is through the forest and is walking only.\n\nIn 2019, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal included Sammed Shikharji under Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojana.\n\nThe temple at Shikharji is a new construction with some parts dating to the eighteenth century. However, the idol itself is very old. Sanskrit inscriptions at the foot of the image date to 1678. At the base of Shikharji is a temple to Bhomiyaji (Taleti). On the walls of the Jain temple at the village of Madhuban, there is a mural painting depicting all the temples on Parasnath Hill. Temples along the track include:\n\nOn August 13, 2012, the world's first to-scale complete replication of Shikharji was opened in Siddhachalam in New Jersey over 120 acres of hilly terrain. Called Shikharji at Siddhachalam, it has become an important place of pilgrimage for the Jain diaspora. There is a small scale replica of Shikharji at Dādābadī, Mehrauli.\n\nThe nearest railway station named \"Parasnath Station\" is situated in Isri Bazar, Dumri, Jharkhand. Its around 25 km from Madhuban, at the base of Shikharji. Parasnath station is situated on Grand Chord, which is part of Howrah-Gaya-Delhi line and Howrah-Allahabad-Mumbai line. Many long distance trains have halts at Parasnath Station. Daily connectivities to Mumbai, Delhi, Jaipur, Ajmer, Kolkata, Patna, Allahbad, Kanpur, Jammutawi, Amritsar, Kalka etc. are available. Even 12301-12302 Howrah Rajdhani Express via Gaya Junction has a halt on Parasnath station which run 6 days in a week.\n\nBy Airway;\nNearest airport is Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport, Durgapur (RDP) West Bengal and 4 hour drive from airport. Durgapur has direct flights from Kolkata and Delhi\n\nBirsa Munda Airport, Ranchi (IXR), Jharkhand is also around 180 Kms (Approximately 4.5 hours), and the drive to Shikhar Ji is quite smooth. Direct flights are available from Delhi.\n\n\"Save Shikharji\" is a protest movement by Jain sects who are against the state's development plans for Shikharji. Jain community members have opposed the plans of the state government to improve the infrastructure in the hill to boost tourism as alleged attempts to commercialize the Shikharji hill. This movement is currently headed by Yugbhushan Surishwarji, and demands Shikharji Hill to be declared officially as a place of worship by Government of Jharkhand.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1791512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791512", "title": "Asian witchcraft", "text": "Asian witchcraft\n\nAsian witchcraft refers to any or all types of witchcraft practiced in Asia.\n\nThe belief in witchcraft and its practice seem to have been widespread in the past. Both in ancient Egypt and in Babylonia it played a conspicuous part, as existing records plainly show. It will be sufficient to quote a short section from the Code of Hammurabi (about 2000 BCE).\n\nIn the Tanakh, references to witchcraft are frequent, and the strong condemnations of such practices which we read there do not seem to be based so much upon the supposition of fraud as upon the \"abomination\" of belief in the magic in itself.\n\nVerses such as Book of Deuteronomy 18:11-12 and Book of Exodus 22:18 \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\" provided scriptural justification for Christian witch-hunters in the early modern period. The word \"witch\" is a translation of the Hebrew \"kashaf\", \"sorceress\". The Bible provides some evidence that these commandments were enforced under the Hebrew kings:\n\nThe Hebrew verb , translated in the King James Version as \"cut off\", can also be translated as \"kill wholesale\" or \"exterminate\".\n\nThe New Testament condemns the practice as an abomination, just as the Old Testament had (Epistle to the Galatians 5:20, compared with the Book of Revelation 21:8; 22:15; and Acts of the Apostles 8:9; 13:6).\n\nThere is some debate, however, as to whether the word used in Galatians and Revelation, \"pharmakeía\", is properly translated as \"sorcery\", as the word was commonly used to describe the malicious use of drugs.\n\nDivination and magic in Islam encompass a wide range of practices, including black magic, warding off the evil eye, the production of amulets and other magical equipment, evocation, cleromancy, astrology and physiognomy.\n\nMuslims, followers of the religion of Islam, do commonly believe in the existence of magic and black magic (\"sihr\"), and explicitly forbid the practice of it. \"Sihr\" is the word for \"black magic\" in Arabic. The best known reference to magic in Islam is in surah al-Falaq, which is a prayer to ward off black magic.\nMany Muslims believe that a person taught black magic to mankind:\nHowever, whereas performing miracles or good magic in Islamic thought is from Messengers (al-Rusul – those who came with a new revealed text) and Prophets (\"al-anbiya\" – those who came to continue the specific law and Revelation of a previous Messenger); supernatural acts are also believed to be performed by awliya – the spiritually accomplished, through ma'rifa – and referred to as \"karamat\" \"extraordinary acts\". Disbelief in the miracles of the Prophets is considered an act of disbelief; belief in the miracles of any given pious individual is not. Neither are regarded as magic, but as signs of Allah at the hands of those close to him that occur by his will and his alone.\n\nMuslim practitioners commonly seek the help of the jinn in magic (singular \"jinni\"). It is a common belief that jinns can possess a human, thus requiring exorcism. (The belief in jinn in general is part of the Muslim faith. Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj narrated the Prophet said: \"Allah created the angels from light, created the jinn from the pure flame of fire, and Adam from that which was described to you (i.e., the clay.)\")\n\nStudents of the history of religion have linked several magical practices in Islam with pre-Islamic Turkish and East African customs. Most notable of these customs is the \"zar\".\n\nJewish law views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with idolatry and/or necromancy; both being serious theological and practical offenses in Judaism. According to Traditional Jewish sources, it is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. Rabbis of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic. However, some of the Rabbis practiced \"magic\" themselves. For instance, Rabbah created a person and sent him to Rabbi Zera, and Rabbi Hanina and Rabbi Oshaia studied every Sabbath evening together and created a small calf to eat (Sanhedrin 65b). In these cases, the \"magic\" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from God rather than pagan gods) than as witchcraft.\n\nBelief in the supernatural is strong in certain parts of India, and lynchings for witchcraft are reported in the press from time to time. According to the Indian National Crime Records Bureau, at least 2100 suspected witches (known as \"dayan\") were murdered between 2000 and 2012. It is believed that an average of over 150 women per year are killed accused of being witches, concentrated across central India. Murder is commonly carried out by means of being burned, hacked or bludgeoned to death, often preceded by ritual humiliation, such as being stripped naked, smeared with filth and forced to eat excrement. For those accused of witchcraft who are not murdered, nearly all suffer permanent ostracism or banishment and their families face social stigma.\n\nIn Japanese folklore the witch can commonly be separated into two categories: those who employ snakes as familiars, and those who employ foxes.\n\nThe fox witch is by far the most commonly seen witch figure in Japan. Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the \"kitsune-tsukai\", and the \"kitsune-mochi\".\n\nThe first of these, the \"kitsune-tsukai\", gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The \"kitsune-tsukai\" then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of 'The Grateful Foxes'. However, once a fox enters the employ of a man it almost exclusively becomes a force of evil to be feared.\n\nA fox under the employ of a human can provide him with many services. The fox can turn invisible and be set out to find secrets and it still retains its many powers of illusion which its master will often put to use in order to trick his enemies. The most feared power the \"kitsune-tsukai\" possesses is his ability to command his fox to possess other humans.\n\nMagical girl genre may be the most commonly known to feature witchcraft, but it appears liberally in any works of fiction where such supernatural power can exist, despite the fact that such magic resembles more of western witchcraft than an oriental counterpart. Evil witch antagonists, borne out of the European concept of witch, are popular; however, their powers rarely stem from worshipping devils.\n\nAttempting to influence others through spells in Joseon was widely censured by the royal court. On discovering that Consort Hwi-bin Kim had used witchcraft on the crown prince, Sejong the Great described her as a \"sorcerer\" or \"evil monster\" () and had her thrown out of the palace.\n\nWitchcraft is a feature of traditional mythology in Kazakhstan and Tajikistan documented since the 16th century. It is believed that once a human dies their soul is owned by the witch that murdered them. \n"}

He appeared in the musical \"Hair\" and at the Woodstock Festival, and released several albums as a singer-songwriter.\n\nSommer grew up in Queens, New York, learned piano and guitar, and began writing songs when in his teens. He attended Woodlands High School. He became friendly with other young musicians and songwriters in the area, including Michael Brown and Leslie West, and wrote several songs for West's band, the Vagrants, including their single \"Beside the Sea\", co-written with producer Felix Pappalardi and his wife Gail.\n\nIn 1967, Sommer joined Michael Brown's band, The Left Banke, as lead singer, replacing Steve Martin and co-writing their single \"And Suddenly\" with Brown, but the group soon fell apart following legal threats by Martin's lawyers. Sommer also wrote \"Brink of Death\", recorded by the band Childe Harold. Shortly afterwards, he was recruited as a cast member of the musical \"Hair\", soon being promoted to the role of Woof. His \"frizzed-out Afro\" hair and eyes featured on the playbill for \"Hair\" in 1969.\n\nHe was signed by Capitol Records, and in June 1969 released his first album, \"The Road to Travel\", produced by Artie Kornfeld as were his next two albums. Kornfeld's involvement with the Woodstock Festival led to Sommer being invited to perform there. He was the third act to perform on the opening Friday, August 15, 1969. He sang ten songs, including \"Jennifer\", a song inspired by his fellow \"Hair\" performer, Jennifer Warnes, and Simon & Garfunkel's \"America\", after which he received the festival's first standing ovation. Bert was accompanied by Ira Stone (guitar, Hammond Organ, Harmonica) and Charles Bilello on Bass. However, because he was signed to a rival record label, a recording of his performance was not made publicly available until 2009.\n\nSommer's second album, \"Inside Bert Sommer\", was released in May 1970 on the Eleuthera label, a subsidiary of Buddah Records, and featured the single \"We're All Playing in the Same Band\", which he wrote at, for, and about the Woodstock festival, about his experience there, reaching number 48 on the Hot 100 in September 1970. Sommer continued to perform in and around New York, often opening the bill for major acts such as Ike and Tina Turner and the Byrds. A third album, \"Bert Sommer\", was released on Buddah in 1971 but, like Sommer's other albums, was commercially unsuccessful. Sommer spent some time in a rehabilitation facility in the early 1970s, and then formed a trio, Sommer, Landis & Roberts, with Gary Roberts (also known as Johnny Rabb) and Rob Landis.\n\nWhile Sommer continued to write songs, he returned to acting. After being encouraged to audition by music producer Artie Ripp, he appeared as \"Flatbush\" of Kaptain Kool and the Kongs on \"The Krofft Supershow\" in 1976, but did not reprise the role in the second season. In 1977, his fourth album, also titled \"Bert Sommer\", produced in Los Angeles by Ron Dante, was released by Capitol Records, but was again unsuccessful and he was dropped by the label.\n\nHe returned to Albany in the early 1980s and continued to perform with Johnny Rabb in a band, The Fabulous Newports. He also continued to record demos in the hope of getting a record deal; one track, \"You\", was featured in the films \"The Patriot\" and \"Stella\". His last performance was in Troy on June 11, 1990, with Rabb.\n\nSommer died in Troy, New York on July 23, 1990, after a long battle with a respiratory illness.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1791514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791514", "title": "Package tour", "text": "Package tour\n\nA package tour, package vacation, or package holiday comprises transport and accommodation advertised and sold together by a vendor known as a tour operator. Other services may be provided such a rental car, activities or outings during the holiday. Transport can be via charter airline to a foreign country, and may also include travel between areas as part of the holiday. Package holidays are a form of product bundling.\n\nPackage holidays are organised by a tour operator and sold to a consumer by a travel agent. Some travel agents are employees of tour operators, others are independent.\n\nThe first organised tours dated back to Thomas Cook who, on 5 July 1841, chartered a train to take a group of temperance campaigners from Leicester to a rally in Loughborough, eleven miles away. By 1872 he was undertaking worldwide tours, albeit with small groups. His company, Thomas Cook & Son (commonly called Thomas Cook or simply \"Cook's\"), grew to become one of the largest and most well known travel agents before being nationalised in 1948.\n\nWith the gradual decline of visits to British seaside resorts after the Second World War, Thomas Cook & Son began promoting foreign holidays (particularly Italy, Spain and Switzerland) in the early 1950s. Information films were shown at town halls throughout Britain. However they made a costly decision by not going into the new form of cheap holidays which combined the transport and accommodation arrangements into a single 'package'. The company went further into decline and were only rescued by a consortium buy-out on 26 May 1972.\n\nVladimir Raitz, the co-founder of the Horizon Holiday Group, pioneered the first mass package holidays abroad with charter flights between Gatwick airport and Corsica in 1950, and organised the first package holiday to Palma in 1952, Lourdes in 1953, and the Costa Brava and Sardinia in 1954. In addition, the amendments made in Montreal to the Convention on International Civil Aviation on 14 June 1954 was very liberal to Spain, allowing impetus for mass tourism using charter planes.\n\nBy the late 1950s and 1960s, these cheap package holidays — which combined flight, transfers, and accommodation — provided the first chance for most people in the United Kingdom to have affordable travel abroad. One of the first charter airlines was Euravia, which commenced flights from Manchester Airport in 1961 and Luton Airport in 1962. Despite opening up mass tourism to Crete and the Algarve in 1970, the package tour industry declined during the 1970s. On 15 August 1974, the industry was shaken by the collapse of the second-largest tour operator, Court Line, which operated under the brand names of Horizon and Clarksons. Nearly 50,000 tourists were stranded overseas and a further 100,000 people faced the loss of booking deposits.\n\nIn 2005 a growing number of consumers were avoiding package holidays and were instead travelling with budget airlines and booking their own accommodation. In the UK, the downturn in the package holiday market led to the consolidation of the tour operator market, which is now dominated by a few large tour operators. The major operators are Thomson Holidays and First Choice part of TUI AG and Thomas Cook AG. Under these umbrella brands are different holiday operators catering to different markets, such as Club 18-30 or traveleze. Budget airlines have also created their own package holiday divisions such as Jet2holidays or Japan Airlines's J-Pack special.\n\nThe trend for package holiday bookings saw a comeback in 2009, as customers sought greater financial security in the wake of a number of holiday and flight companies going bust, and as the hidden costs of 'no-frills' flights increased. Coupled with the search for late holidays as holidaymakers left booking to the last moment, this led to a rise in consumers booking package holidays.\n\nDynamic packaging is a method that is becoming increasingly used in package holiday booking procedures that enables consumers to build their own package of flights, accommodation, and rental car instead of a pre-defined packages.\n\nDynamic Packaging allows guests to create their own vacation, similar to a private or custom tour. This method allows guests to use a company's itinerary or create their own to allow for more flexible options while using an agency's services.\n"}

Fundão proper is an old city with 8,369 inhabitants in 2001, situated at the point where the slope of the Gardunha range meets the Cova da Beira plains, 500 metres above sea level. The municipality population in 2011 was 29,213. The area size is 700.20 km². The city is subdivided into 23 parishes. The film festival, IMAGO – Young Film and Video Festival, is organised in the town.\n\nDuring the Iron Age, from about 1000 B.C. until its destruction by the Romans, there was a Celtic Lusitanian Castro or fortified village in nearby São Brás Mount. The remains of a villa or agricultural manor house, workers houses and other associated buildings from the time of the Roman Empire have been found in the underground of the centre of the current city. This villa was rebuilt as a fortified medieval mansion during the High Middle Ages.\n\nThe history of Fundão is intimately related to that of its originally Jewish, then New Christian or Marrano, population.\n\nAlthough the place was already mentioned in documents from 1307 referring 32 houses, the bulk of the population only settled after the 1492 Expulsion of the Jews from Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella, mainly Spanish Jews (sephardic). Close to the border, and already home to significant Jewish minorities the Cova da Beira region, the region received many refugees. They settled in the community of Fundão, which their numbers swelled to that of a city. The influx of Jewish artisans and merchants quickly transformed it into an important commercial and industrial center. With the establishment of the Portuguese Inquisition shortly thereafter, many Jews and New Christians were arrested, tortured, executed or had their possessions expropriated. The commercial dynamism of the city was affected.\n\nThe place was proclaimed a city in 1580 by its notables, after support for their attempt was declared by Dom António, Prior do Crato, to preserve Portuguese independence against the ambitions of King Philip II of Spain (Philip I of Portugal). The Municipal Council and autonomy were granted in 1747.\n\nDuring the Enlightenment of the late 18th century, under the rule of Marquis of Pombal, the Prime-Minister of Portugal, legal restraints on the New Christians were abolished and rights equiparated to those of the Old Christians. Pombal tried to recreate the industrial preëminence of Fundão by founding the Royal Factories (today known as the City Hall). These efforts allowed a measure of revival to the wool industries of the city, and cloth was again exported to northern Europe. The city decayed again after its sack during the defeated Napoleonic French invasions of Portugal, and the subsequent Civil War between supporters of the Liberal Constitutionalist D. Pedro and his brother Conservative Absolutist D. Miguel, who were competing for the throne.\n\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 23 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\n\nThe town is an important local center of industry and services. Around it lies some of the most fertile land in the region, in a large valley (Cova da Beira) between the Gardunha and Estrela ranges, where the Zêzere River starts its way towards the Tagus. The most significant productions are cherries, peaches, olive oil, wine, wood pulp and vegetables.\n\nSome of the most important wolframite mines in the world (a mineral source for the element tungsten) are explored within its municipal limits. Other important mines extract lead and tin. High quality mineral water is bottled from several sources.\n\nThe Cavleiro tree is a common trade item from this region. It is used in everyday products such as wooden dolls, shoes and bedposts.\n\n"}

In 1520 Ricciarda Malaspina, granddaughter of Iacopo and last direct heir of the house, married Lorenzo Cybo, member of an influential Genoese family related to the Medici and with Pope Innocent VIII.\nFrom this marriage originated the new house of Cybo-Malaspina.\n\nUnder his rule the land went through a very prosperous period, thanks to a high demand for Carrara marble in various courts.\nAlberico I, aware that its territory was surrounded by more powerful and influential neighbors, submitted in 1554 to the Holy Roman Empire of Charles V. Due to cultural and economic achievements under the government of Alberico I, the city of Carrara was awarded the title of marquisate in 1558. In 1568 Massa was elevated to a principality by Emperor Maximilian II.\n\nIn 1664 the territory of Massa became a duchy and Carrara became a principality. The Cybo-Malaspina gained the title of Dukes of Massa and Princes of Carrara.\n\nIn 1738 Maria Teresa Cybo-Malaspina, the last descendant of the family, married Ercole d'Este, the last male heir of the Duchy of Modena. Their daughter Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d'Este thus passed both duchies to her son Francis.\n\nIn 1796 the Este were deprived of their possessions by Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion. Napoleon annexed the territory to the Cispadane Republic, then merging it in the Cisalpine Republic.\n\nDuring this time the territory was briefly fought between Napoleon and the Austrian anti-French coalition (1799), and experienced a rapid succession of different administrative systems more or less provisional (Department of the Apuan Alps, Imperial and Royal Provisional Regency of Massa-Carrara, then again Department of the Apuan Alps and finally District of Massa).\n\nAs a final administrative change, in 1806 the French emperor gave the Duchy of Massa and Carrara to the Principality of Lucca and Piombino, ruled by his elder sister Elisa Bonaparte.\nDuring the Napoleonic domination Mary Beatrice was forced to take refuge in Vienna at the court of her husband, the Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este, uncle of Emperor Francis I of Austria.\n\nWith the fall of the Napoleonic regime, the Congress of Vienna reassigned to Mary Beatrice all the territories that had been subtracted. At that time the Duchy of Massa and Carrara included the territories of Massa and Carrara, Aulla, Casola in Lunigiana, Comano, Filattiera, Fivizzano, Fosdinovo, Licciana, Montignoso, Mulazzo, Podenzana and Tresana.\n\nIn 1829, at the death of Mary Beatrice, the Duchy of Massa and Carrara was annexed to the Duchy of Modena and Reggio by her son Francesco IV d'Este.\n\nIn 1859, with the deposition of Francesco V d'Este, the Duchy of Modena and Reggio (which also includes the territories of Massa and Carrara) was permanently attached to the Kingdom of Sardinia, with the formation of province of Massa-Carrara in December 1859.\n\n\nThe merge of the Malaspina family with the Cybo family brought the territory to a rather lavish court life. In the conduct of foreign policy the Cybo-Malaspina maintained a role as an intermediary between the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Republic of Genoa.\n\nAlberico I brought large urban restructurations in the cities of Carrara and Massa, mainly for prestige reasons. Both cities were equipped with new city walls - with representative functions, rather than military, since the policy of the territory was not expansionist - and new ducal palaces. In Carrara was established the Office of Marble (1564), to regulate the marble mining industry.\n\nThe city of Massa, in particular, saw much of its plan redesigned (new roads, plazas, intersections, pavings) in order to make it worthy of an Italian country's capital.\n\nThe War of Spanish Succession (1701–1714) was the beginning of the period of deep economic crisis for the duchy. The Empire punished with heavy fines the Cybo-Malspina, who had given hospitality to French troops on its territory. Already Alberich III, but especially Alderamo, found themselves forced to sell many city goods. Alderamo arrived to force people to buy food at a premium, and also because of the luxurious and extravagant lifestyle of the nobleman, the economics of the Duchy was brought to its knees. The financial situation recovered only by dynastic union between the families of the Malaspina and the Este, achieved with the marriage of Maria Teresa and Ercole d'Este in 1741.\n\nFrom that date, the Duchy of Massa and Carrara gradually lost its political autonomy, going to gravitate more and more closely into the city of Modena sphere of influence. Under the domination of the Este, the Duchy of Massa Carrara rose to occupy a strategic position, in that it provided a sea outlet to the hinterland domains and promised an easier trade route. Already under Maria Teresa road links between the Duchy of Modena and Reggio to Massa & Carrara were significantly improved. These road reform attempts include the construction of the Via Vandelli, starting as early as 1738.\n\nIn 1751, was made a first attempt for the excavation of a dock and the construction of a port in the city of Carrara. The port would have been functional to the trade and military activities of the Este, would have housed in a safe place the small fleet of the Duchy of Modena and, finally, would have been essential to free the marble exports from dependence of other nearby ports. The coast, however, had a tendency to silt up and after a few years the construction work had to be suspended.\n\nIn 1807 Napoleon's engineers built the important mail road to the Foce, to link the cities of Massa and Carrara through the inland hills. During the Napoleonic rule were also initiated other public works such as the bonification of the plains, the plantation of coastal pine trees to combat malaria and arrangement of river banks. These works were continued by Maria Beatrice and successors in subsequent decades.\nIn 1821 the Este Land Registry was established, with the task of regulating and listing the properties of the inhabitants of the duchy.\n\nThe years following the annexation to the Duchy of Modena were particularly complex, both for the insurrectional riots that characterized the historical period, and for the economic crisis, which have long gripped the region. The rulers tried several times to exit the stagnation in promoting the construction of infrastructure to increase the volume of trade, but the lack of money often proves an insurmountable obstacle.\n\nA second attempt to build the port of Carrara was entrusted by Duke Francis IV to the engineer Aschenden in 1830, but the project was never made for lack of funds. A dock loader, which came to be the first authentic port core of Carrara was built successfully only in 1851, thanks to the English engineer and tycoon William Walton.\nIn 1846 the Count Francesco del Medico proposed to the Duke Francis V the construction of the Marble Railway of Carrara, to link the marble quarries to the sea and thereby facilitating the transport of blocks to the areas for sorting, loading, and shipping. This project was also suspended for lack of funds. The Marble Railway was finally built after the Italian unification (1871–1890).\n\nIn the last years of the duchy, an increasing number of clashes was seen between the liberals and the ducal government, especially in Carrara.\nThe territory was chosen by Count Camillo Benso di Cavour and Napoleon III to organize popular anti-Austrian riots and give France an opportunity to intervene on the side of Piedmont in Italy, giving way to the Second Italian War of Independence.\n"}

The peak is located in White River National Forest, south-southeast (bearing 162°) of downtown Aspen in Pitkin County, Colorado, United States. The north face of the mountain is the location of the Aspen Mountain ski area, one of four adjacent ski areas operated collectively as Aspen/Snowmass.\n\nAspen Mountain is not particularly high, relative to other mountains in Colorado, but nonetheless looms over the town of Aspen because of the proximity of the town, which was founded as a silver mining camp in 1879 during the Colorado Silver Boom. The mountain flank was the site of intense mining activity in the late 1880s and early 1890s, with many remains of mining activity below and on the surface of the mountain. In the middle 20th century it became the site of recreational downhill skiing. In 1946, the newly formed Aspen Skiing Company, founded by Walter Paepcke, built the first chairlift to the top of the mountain and opened the ski area that bears the name of the mountain. Nowadays, people use a modern gondola, which holds six people, to get to the top of the mountain.\n\nAspen Mountain is alternatively called Ajax by the locals.\n"}

{"id": "1791536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791536", "title": "Dynamic packaging", "text": "Dynamic packaging\n\nDynamic packaging is a method used in package holiday bookings to enable consumers to build their own package of flights, accommodation, and car rental instead of purchasing a pre-defined package. Dynamic packages differ from traditional package tours in that the pricing is always based on current availability, escorted group tours are rarely included, and trip-specific add-ons such as airport parking and show tickets are often available. Dynamic packages are similar in that often the air, hotel, and car rates are available only as part of a package or only from a specific seller. The term \"dynamic packaging\" is often used incorrectly to describe the less sophisticated process of interchanging various travel components within a package, however, this practice is more accurately described as \"dynamic bundling\". True dynamic packaging demands the automated recombination of travel components based on the inclusion of rules that not only dictate the content of the package but also conditional pricing rules based on various conditions such as the trip characteristics, suppliers contributing components, the channel of distribution, and terms of sale. Dynamic packages are primarily sold online, but online travel agencies will also sell by phone owing to the strong margins and high sale price of the product.\n\nDynamic packaging is dynamic at several levels. Firstly, inventory is sourced dynamically, meaning the dynamic packaging solution will source flights, accommodation and car rental components for the package in real-time. Secondly, these components are dynamically combined into packages. Thirdly, the package is dynamically priced and is usually given an opaque total price.\n\nDynamic packages are normally given a single, opaque price, meaning the wholesaler's cost of the individual components is hidden from the consumer. The wholesaler often obtains special package-only cost rates for travel components, such as negotiated fares for flights or special package rates for accommodation or car rental. These cost prices are typically significantly lower than the cost prices suppliers offer for the same products if they were to be sold as single components. Hence, the wholesaler will be able to offer the consumer a combined saving for the dynamic package, without reducing his own margins.\n\nOpaque pricing of dynamic packages hide the price of the included components. This has several benefits. Suppliers of travel products often impose a minimum selling price for their products. For instance, a hotel might give the wholesaler a room at cost price \"X\", but on the condition that the room is not sold for less than \"Y\" (hotels do this to prevent wholesalers from competing with themselves). With dynamic packaging, the customer is not presented with the room price, only the overall package price, so hotels typically allow the wholesaler to discount the (hidden) price of the hotel more.\n\nOpaque pricing also has benefits for airlines. Airlines tend to increase their fares the closer you get to the departure date, even if there are many available seats. This is to \"train\" the consumers to book early, making it easier for the airline to do proper revenue management. If airlines were to dump their fares if a flight failed to fill up, then this would train the customers to wait until very close to departure before booking. This would make it virtually impossible for an airline to manage their fares (fares could then only be determined based on historical data and not based on current demand). Dynamic packaging allows an airline to get rid of distressed inventory at discounted fares, as the discounted fare is effectively hidden from the consumer.\n\nDynamic Packaging is also often misunderstood since it requires that the provider of Dynamic Packaging be a wholesaler, who must also issue tickets, vouchers or other redeemable coupons in order to become a Dynamic Packager. Without an inventory management system, and a ticket, coupon or voucher issuing system to make the prices of the individual components appear as one price to the consumer and allow each travel service provider to know what rate to accept or charge the traveler; dynamic packaging does not work. Many travel retailers have mistakenly assumed they could provide dynamic packaging without an inventory management system, mark-up engine with business rules and a ticket issuing and resolution system.\n\nThe wholesaler must either directly control the inventory that is combined into packages or buy the package components up-front from other travel suppliers. This implies that dynamic packages (as with static packages) are always pre-paid by the customer.\n\nThe wholesaler would typically also require special discounted fares/rates from the travel suppliers. For car rental, the supplier (car rental company or intermediary) should ideally supply their price based on calendar days rather than hour-by-hour. Calendar day rates reduce the number of vehicle availability/pricing scans the wholesaler must make. For packages that include flights, the outbound arrival and return departure date/times determine the car rental pick-up and drop-off date/times. If car rental rates were by the hour they would differ for each flight option, hence the wholesaler would have to issue a vehicle availability search for each available flight, while with 24-hour rates one single vehicle availability search is enough to cater for all flight options.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1791543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791543", "title": "Angrivarii", "text": "Angrivarii\n\nThe Angrivarii (or \"Angrivari\") were a Germanic people of the early Roman Empire, who lived in what is now northwest Germany near the middle of the Weser river. They were mentioned by the Roman authors Tacitus and Ptolemy.\n\nThey were part of the Germanic alliance of Arminius and his defeat of the Romans at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in the 9th year of the common era.\n\nThe Angrivarii lived in an area which was later called Angria (Modern German \"\"\"\") in the Middle Ages, which was a major part of the Carolingian Duchy of Saxony. Both names probably derive from geographical terminology.\n\nIn his \"Germania\" Tacitus described the Angrivarii and their western neighbours the Chamavi living closer to the Rhine than \"the Dulgubini and Chasuarii, and other tribes not equally famous\" and west of the Frisii who lived towards the Rhine river which was the official border of the Roman Empire. The Chasuarii probably lived near the Hase river and the Ampsivarii who lived on the Ems river, and the Dulgubini probably towards the Elbe. North of all these peoples lived the Chauci, whose territory stretched to the North Sea coast.\n\nAmong the more detailed mentions of the Angrivarii which Tacitus makes in his \"Annals\", he describes them also as neighbours to the powerful Cherusci people, of Arminius. They had built a dike to mark the boundary and this was west of the Weser.\n\nTacitus also notes in his \"Germania\" that together with the Chamavi, the Angrivarii had invaded the lands formerly held by the Bructeri to their southwest. The Bructeri had lived near the Ems and Lippe rivers, between the Rhine and Weser. This occurred the Teutoburger battle.\n\nThe name appears earliest in the Annales and Germania of Tacitus as Angrivarii. In Greek, Ptolemy called them the Angriouarroi (), which transliterates into Latin Angrivari. In post-classical history the name of the people had a number of different spellings in addition to the ones just mentioned.\n\nThe name Angrivarii can be segmented Angri-varii meaning \"the men of Engern\", parallel to Ampsi-varii, \"the men of the Ems\". Engern, their region, is related to a word for meadows, as in modern German \"\"\"\", and appears as a component in placenames around Germany.\n\nJulius Pokorny derives the first element from an Indo-European root *ang-, \"to bend, bow.\" From this root are also derived German \"Anger\", English dialect \"ing\", Danish \"eng\", Swedish \"äng\", Dutch \"eng\"/\"enk\", and many other forms in Germanic languages, all meaning \"meadow, pasture.\" Cf. the similar element Angeln.\n\nThe second element \"-varii\" is most prolific among Germanic tribal names, commonly taken to mean \"inhabitants of\", \"dwellers in\". Its precise etymology remains unclear, but there is a general consensus that it cannot be derived from the PIE root \"*wihrós\", \"man\", surviving in English \"\"were\"-wolf\".\n\nTheir geographical-based name is associated with the 8th century region called Angria (Angaria, Angeriensis, Aggerimensis and Engaria), which was one of four subdivisions of Old Saxony (the others were Westfalahi and Ostfalahi and Nordalbingia). This region is now referred to in modern German as Engern, and it corresponds reasonably well with the area where the Angrivarii lived, comprising most of the country surrounding the middle Weser, including both flat land, as around Minden, and low hills (Holzminden).\n\nAlthough the Angrivarii receive brief mention in Ptolemy (2.10) and the \"Germania\" of Tacitus (33), they appear mainly at several locations in \"Annales\". They were involved marginally in the wars fought by the talented Germanicus Caesar on behalf of his uncle Tiberius, emperor of Rome, against the perpetrators of the massacre of three Roman legions in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, the year 9. \n\nThe wars began in the last years of the reign of Augustus, first emperor of Rome. Augustus died an old but respected man in the year 14 and was celebrated with much pomp and splendor. He left a document to be read to the senate posthumously, expressly forbidding extension of the empire beyond the Rhine. News of the will was welcomed by the Germans, thinking it gave them a free hand in the region. Germanicus found it necessary to pacify the border, which he did by a combination of scorched earth raids and offers of alliance with Rome - in short, stick and carrot. These raids also kept the army of the lower Rhine distracted from the possibility of mutiny, which had broken out on Augustus's death and only been quelled by concessions and executions.\n\nFor punitive expeditions Germanicus used the Ems river, which flowed from the heart of the country occupied by the tribes that became the Franks. These were still under Arminius, who had led the German confederation to the victory in 9. Unlike Arminius' native tribe, the Cherusci, the loyalty of the other tribes in the confederation was at best equivocal.\n\nThe Angrivarii's defection or revolt (\"defectio\") in the middle of Arminius's renewed operations against the Teutoburg Forest must have been secured in advance by Germanicus. Even if it was not, a cavalry attack soon brought the Angrivarii's capitulation. Soon afterwards, however, they are back in alliance with the Cherusci and opposition to the Romans, setting an ambush at the Cheruscan border, which was a high dirt embankment. They hid their cavalry in the woods and stationed their infantry on the reverse slope of the bank. The Romans had intelligence of the plan beforehand. They assaulted the embankment, preceding their assault with volleys from slings and spears thrown by machines. Driving the Angrivarii from the bank, they went on to pursue the cavalry in the woods. Once again the Angrivarii were totally routed.\n\nOnce the Cherusci had been dealt with, Germanicus turned his attention to the Angrivarii. They, however, surrendered unconditionally to the general sent by Germanicus and placed themselves in the status of suppliants, begging for mercy, which Germanicus granted. This later reaped dividends for the Angrivarii played a major role in securing the return of ships and men lost in a North Sea storm which scattered the Roman fleet upon the shore of hostile or neutral Germanic tribes.\n\nFinally, on May 26 of the year 17, Germanicus celebrated a triumph for his victory over lower Germany and his uncle sent him off to the east. Arminius died and the Angrivarii, the other west Germans and their successor tribes continued friendly towards Rome, providing it with elite troops and urban and palace police.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1791545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791545", "title": "Southern house spider", "text": "Southern house spider\n\nThe southern house spider is a species of large spider in the family Filistatidae. Currently given the scientific name Kukulcania hibernalis, it was formerly known as Filistata hibernalis. Found in the Americas, it exhibits strong sexual dimorphism. It is occurs in the southern states of the USA, throughout Central America and some of the Caribbean, to southern Brazil and Uruguay. The males may be mistaken for brown recluses because the two have similar coloration and body structure. However, compared to the brown recluse, male southern house spiders are typically larger in size, lack the distinctive violin shape on their cephalothorax, and have unusually long slender pedipalps. The females are dark brown or black and more compact. Both sexes may grow to be roughly across (legs extended), with the males typically having longer legs, and the females often having larger, bulbous bodies. The abdomen of the southern house spider is covered with fine velvety light gray hair.\n\nFemale southern house spiders are rarely seen, as they build radial webs around crevices, for which reason their family (Filistatidae) is called crevice weavers. Females seldom move except to capture prey caught in their webs. Males, on the other hand, typically wander in search of insects and females to mate with, having no particular territory.\n\nThe southern house spider is a cribellate spider. That is, its spinnerets do not produce adhesive webbing. Instead, to capture prey the spider uses its legs to comb webbing across its cribellum, a spiked plate near the spinnerets. This combing action frays and tangles the strands, producing a fine, velcro-like netting that ensnares insect legs.\n\nMale southern house spiders sometimes appear aggressive, but they do not bite unless trapped, and their mouthparts are too small to easily penetrate human skin. They do, however, have an unnerving tendency to crawl across anything in their path regardless of whether it is alive. This is not aggression; these spiders are simply nearly blind and cannot see larger animals. Indeed, these spiders instinctively play dead if they feel threatened (a tactic which is effective against their common predators).\n\nSouthern house spiders are capable of crawling through crevices as narrow as 1/4 in (0.66 cm) due to their elongated bodies and compact legs.\n\nThe southern house spider mating ritual is a lengthy (over an hour) and elaborate process with long periods during which neither the male nor the female moves considerably. When the wandering male encounters a female's web, there may be an initial confrontation where each scares the other. Upon recovering, the male then constructs a large web around the female's crevice. When this web is complete, the male pulls on its strands continuously to draw the female out of her hole, which may take several minutes. Following her emergence, each spider will tap at the other in an effort to grasp the other by the forelegs, with the male remaining suspended in his web.\n\n"}

The three-member Board was created as part of an expansion of the U.S. Navy Department at the end of the War of 1812. The system was implemented by Benjamin W. Crowninshield, Secretary of the Navy during the administrations of Presidents James Madison and James Monroe.\n\nFollowing the recommendations of William Jones, the establishment of the Board of Naval Commissioners by act of Congress on February 7, 1815 (3 Stat. 202), was the outgrowth of efforts to relieve the Secretary of the Navy of some of responsibilities connected with the civilian functions of the navy, so he could devote more time to overall administration.\n\nAs naval warfare continued to increase in technical complexity, however, reformers began to consider that the three commissioners and a minimal staff were not enough to handle the navy's procurement needs. By the 1840s, it seemed that a functional approach was preferable—one which established bureaus or offices within the Navy Department to focus on specific areas such as shipbuilding or provisioning. This reform was finally achieved during the administration of President John Tyler, and implemented by his Secretary of the Navy Abel P. Upshur. An Act of Congress on August 31, 1842 abolished the Board of Naval Commissioners and established the \"bureau system\" in the Department of the Navy. This system, with modifications, lasted until the mid-1960s.\n\nThe board had responsibility for the procurement of naval stores and materials; construction, armament, equipment, repair, and preservation of naval vessels; establishment of regulations to secure uniformity in the classes of naval vessels; preparation of estimates of expenditures for different parts of the naval service; and supervision of navy yards, naval stations, and navy agents. The Secretary of the Navy retained control over personnel and appointments, movement of ships, and other administrative matters not delegated to the board.\n\nAs provided by the act, the board, attached to the Office of the Secretary, was composed of three post-captains appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; the ranking officer of the board was to be its president. The board was authorized to establish its own regulations and employ a secretary to keep a record of its proceedings and two clerks to assist in other office work. Each commissioner was to receive $3,500 a year in lieu of wages, rations, and other pay due him as a naval officer.\n\nDuring its existence the board had five presidents. All held the courtesy rank of commodore; the rank of admiral did not come into existence until the American Civil War. \n\nChauncey, Morris, and Warrington also served on the board prior to their appointments to its presidency. Chauncey served from 1822 to 1824 and 1833 to 1837; Morris from 1823 to 1825, 1826 to 1827, and 1832 to 1840; and Warrington from 1827 to 1830 and 1840 to 1841.\n\nThe officers listed below served as the board's other commissioners. Likewise, all held the courtesy rank of commodore.\n\nJames Kirke Paulding—later Secretary of the Navy during the Van Buren administration—served as secretary of the board from 1815 to 1823. He was succeeded by the Navy Department's long-time chief clerk, Charles Washington Goldsborough.\n\n"}

It was worn with matching straight trousers and a kepi (red for Imperial Guard) on which was worn a brass five point star. After the Franco-Prussian War the kepi was replaced with a flat topped peaked cap and the tunic collar became higher. Pockets were added to officers' tunics late in its issue.\nInfantry uniforms had red facings on tunic collars, shoulder straps and trouser stripes. Line infantry had yellow bands and piping on their caps while the infantry of the Imperial Guard were distinguished by red. Trouser seams for both branches of the infantry had wide red stripes. Artillery had yellow facings on their dark blue uniforms. The branch colour for engineers was dark brown, green for medical and light blue for transport units. Finance, administration and other support services had white facings.\n\nA dark blue shako (red for Imperial Guard units) with a short white plume was worn for full dress. The ordinary duty and active service headdress was however a form of peaked cap with a narrow crown, somewhat resembling the French kepi of the period.\n\nA lightweight white cotton uniform was used for fatigue duties and tropical wear. In hot weather white trousers and cap covers were worn with the dark blue tunics. White canvas leggings were worn by non-mounted personnel with both white and blue uniforms until 1906.\nSenior officers could wear a longer, double-breasted version of the tunic in full dress. Other features included elaborate Austrian knots (gold braiding on the cuffs according to rank), waist sashes, gold shoulder cords and plumes on the dress kepi. For ordinary duties and active service officers of all ranks wore dark blue dolmans braided in black. In 1904 this was replaced by a dark blue tunic of simpler pattern.\n\nCavalry regiments wore a short attila jacket with transverse hussar-style braiding in yellow (red for the cavalry of the Imperial Guard). Breeches were red. The cavalry branch colour was green and in 1905 this colour appeared on both collars and breeches stripes. As with the other branches of the Imperial Guard, the cavalry were distinguished by red bands and piping on their service caps. Red trousers were also worn by army bands and by the Military Police (\"Kenpeitai\").\n\nThe dark blue uniform adopted under the 1886 Regulations was retained with only minor modifications until 1905. As such it was worn during the early months of the Russo-Japanese War. A khaki summer uniform had been introduced shortly before the outbreak of war and this became general issue for front line infantry during June–August 1904. Cavalry and artillery were subsequently issued with the new khaki uniform but some second line units continued to wear dark blue until the end of the War in September 1905. During the winter of 1904-05 the heavier blue uniforms were again worn but often under the loose fitting summer khaki drill for camouflage. The white canvas leggings continued to be worn without darkening, until after the war.\n\nFollowing the Russo-Japanese War the Japanese Army adopted khaki for all occasions – the first major army to discard colourful parade dress. Only the cavalry squadrons of the Imperial Guard and officers of all branches were authorized to retain their coloured uniforms for certain ceremonial and social occasions, until 1939.\n\nThis was basically a khaki cotton version of the 1886 uniform with a shorter jacket. First appearing as a fatigue dress in 1900, it was being issued as a hot-weather uniform in 1904 to replace the white summer clothing described above. The practical advantages of khaki drill over dark blue became obvious in the opening stages of the Russo-Japanese War and it became general issue for troops on active service as stocks became available. In 1906 a khaki serge cold-weather uniform and greatcoat had also been adopted.\n\nThe 1911 uniform replaced the blue uniform with the exceptions noted above. The 1911 khaki colored version (called khaki in the west the colour was actually a yellowish-brown called Ochre) of the blue uniform. The new flat topped peaked cap had a red band, the tunic collar had red swallow tailed gorget patches and the shoulders had red shoulder bars (see photograph opposite) to indicate rank. The uniform was produced in wool for winter and cotton for summer wear.\n\nThe Showa Type 5, also called the M90 or 2590 or 1930 uniform, was basically the 1911 uniform but introduced internal breast pockets with scalloped pocket flaps on the tunic for all ranks. Also the straight trousers were later replaced with pantaloons which were worn with woolen spiral wound puttees and tapes.\n\nThe M98 (1938) was a further modification of the M90 uniform. The single breasted tunic (98 Shiki-Gun-i) had a stand and fall collar, five buttons which ran down the front and two, or more usually, four internal pockets with scalloped flaps (depending on the manufacturer). Long trousers or pantaloons (Bousyo-ko) were worn as standard along with the puttees (Kya-han) and tapes. All except mounted troops (who wore breeches and high leather boots) wore this uniform with horsehide, pigskin or leather ankle-boots. The boots (amiage-gutu) had either a hobnailed hard leather sole with metal heel J-cleat or a rubber sole with rubber cleats. When off duty, soldiers could wear tabis. A collarless wool or cotton white, grey or light green under shirt (Bousho Jyu-han) was worn under the tunic. This had one or two patch breast pockets with buttoned flaps, most had only a single pocket on the left breast. A khaki cotton shirt with stand and fall collar and two breast pockets could be worn in warm climates, with or without the tunic. The flat-topped peaked cap was replaced by a cloth field cap (Sen-bou) with a short leather or (more usually) cloth peak. Originally produced in khaki it was later produced in various shades of green ranging from grey-green to a dark green. The cap was more of a peaked sidecap and could be worn with a neck flap (Bou-tare), hooked to the bottom for sun protection, made from four cloth rectangles.\n\nThe Type 3 was an officers only uniform, it was introduced in 1943 and was similar to the Type 98 but was made of cheaper materials. It also reintroduced cuff insignias for officers consisting of 1, 2, or 3 stripes of dark-brown braid on or above the cuff to indicate company, field, or general officers' grades respectively. It was produced in various shades of green. Officers could wear the uniform tunic open over a white or light green shirt with or without a black or green tie.\n\nOfficers were not usually issued uniforms so they had to procure their own, thus there was a wide variety in the details, colour and texture of their uniforms, with uniform colours ranging from tan (this case is modified Older Uniform. its started after Showa 13 rules(昭和13年制式) era) to dark green. Collars were taller and stiffer and materials were of a higher quality. Senior officers could procure and wear a double-breasted version of the blue and M90 uniforms. All ranks wore a single breasted version of the M98. Officers could wear straight trousers with their M98 uniforms as a walking out uniform and later they could also wear the tunic with the collar open over a white or grey green shirt.\n\nThe olive service cap is a peaked cap similar in shape to that of the United States Army but with a smaller flatter crown and shorter visor. Red piping runs along the outer edge of the crown and the headband has a 1 1/2 inch wide red felt band. At the front of the red band is a gold star. The Imperial Guard service hat has a semicircular wreath of leaves below the star. The visor and chin strap are of black leather in standard military design.\n\nThe Sen-bou is a cloth field cap with a short leather or (more usually) cloth peak. Originally produced in khaki it was later produced in various shades of green ranging from grey-green to a dark green. The cap was more of a peaked sidecap and could be worn with a neck flap (Bou-tare), hooked to the bottom for sun protection, made from four cloth rectangles\n\n\n\nThe IJA issues two types of tropical helmets to its troops:\n\n\nThe IJA issued single-breasted cloaks, over coats, capes and raincoats with hoods in khaki.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Constitution of the German Empire (1871) was closely based on it. \n\nA \"Konstituierender Reichstag\" was elected on 12 February 1867. Its only task was to discuss and adopt the proposal for a constitution, as presented by the allied governments. The proposal was essentially written by Otto von Bismarck, the Prussian minister-president and first and only \"Bundeskanzler\" (the sole minister) of the Confederation. The Konstituierender Reichstag was dominated by national liberals and moderate conservatives.\n\nAccording to the theory of the time, the highest organ of the country was the \"Bundesrat\" (Federal Council). It represented the governments of the North German states. Prussia had 17 of 43 votes in the council, giving it the right of veto. By constitution, the King of Prussia (William I), was the holder of the \"Bundespräsidium\", de facto the head of state. He installed the \"Bundeskanzler\" (Federal Chancellor), the federal executive. Besides the chancellor, there were no ministers.\n\nThe \"Reichstag\" (although the country was called \"Bund\") was the parliament, elected by all male north Germans above the age of 25. This was quite extraordinary in those times; Bismarck introduced this in the hope that it would create conservative majorities. \"Reichstag\" and council together had legislative powers, making the democratically elected \"Reichstag\" an important and powerful organ.\n\nAfter the Franco–Prussian War of 1870/1871, the south German states Baden, Bavaria and Württemberg joined the confederation. It was renamed \"Deutsches Reich\" (German Empire), and the constitution of the confederation, with few changes, became the Constitution of the German Empire.\n\n"}

Bird/Mary Heinlein Fruit & Spice Park, is a 37-acre park located in the heart of Redland, Florida and is the only botanical garden of its kind in the United States. This park is operated by Miami-Dade County Parks and Open Spaces Department. The park in itself attracts more than 50,000 visitors a year because of its unique agricultural environment. The garden features more than 500 different types of international exotic fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices. Visitors are allowed to sample fallen fruits, enjoy lunch at the Mango Cafe, or schedule a tour of the park.\nThe Redland area, part of southern Miami-Dade County, has always been known for its many farms, unique ability to grow fresh fruit, and its reddish soil. Mary Calkins Heinlein was the daughter of pioneer sub-tropical farmers and had always had a passion for fruits and gardens in South Florida. She had a goal to showcase the Redland and its rich agricultural environment. In 1935, she got in contact with county commissioners and pioneer Parks Director to begin multiple transactions to purchase 18 acres in the Redland. County commissioner Preston B. Bird finalized the deal in 1943 and received ownership for the land with Heinlein. South Date County's Park Development Department signed a contract with William Lyman Philips to develop the vision that Heinlein had for the garden. In 1944, construction began and Heinlein was named Superintendent. The garden featured many different fruits and agricultural developments that Heinlein had hoped for. It even showcased two historical structures: the original Redland Schoolhouse and a coral rock building. After inspiring the creation of the garden and naming it the Redland Fruit and Spice Park, Heinlein's 10-year reign ended in 1959 when she retired as Superintendent. She continued to stay an active garden club member and develop insights on the different fruits that should be planted until she died in 1979. In memory of her and Preston B. Bird, the county renamed the Redland Fruit and Spice Park to the Preston B. Bird/Mary Heinlein Fruit & Spice Park in 1980.\n\nThe park contains more than 500 varieties of fruits, nuts, and spice trees. It also includes more than 80 banana trees, 160 varieties of mango trees, more than 40 varieties of grape trees, and 70 varieties of bamboo trees. It also features guava, jackfruit, canistel, sapodilla, longan, lychee, mamey and black sapote, miracle fruit, jaboticaba, and coffee beans. Visitors are allowed to sample these fruits once they have fallen on the ground, but they are not allowed to pick them up off the trees. The park also features guided tours that will take you around the park and show you all that it has to offer. The tours are available every day at 11 a.m., 1:30 p.m., and 3 p.m. Private tours are also available for school or club field trips.\n\nEntrance requires an admission fee of $10 per adult and $3 per child, but the entrance has a store open to the public where many fruits from the park can be sampled for free. A tram is available with a guide for free once inside the park. It leaves from nearby the spice garden. The park includes a cafe. The entrance hall has a large library of gardening books, spices, honey, jams, jellies, and souvenirs for sale.\n\n\n"}

Two of the legends are found in the Poetic Edda, and the Hervarar saga can be seen as a compilation of these legends.\n\nThe first part deals with the forging of the sword Tyrfing by the Dwarves Durin and Dvalin. They are forced to do so by Svafrlami, the king of Gardariki, but in revenge they curse the sword so that it will kill a man every time it is unsheathed, cause three evil deeds and be the undoing of Svarflami.\n\nSvafrlami is killed in single combat with the berserker Arngrim, who takes the sword and gives it to his son Angantyr.\n\nThe second part deals with the legend of Hjalmar, Orvar-Odd and the duel on Samsø. Arngrim's twelve sons meet Hjalmar and Orvar-Odd in a duel, but the outnumbered heroes kill Arngrim's sons. However, Hjalmar has been wounded by Tyrfing and dies.\n\nThe third part deals with Angantyr's daughter Hervor and how she reclaims Tyrfing from her father's ghost.

It was erected at King's Beach on Water Street where, in 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert claimed Newfoundland for England. It was formally unveiled on Memorial Day, July 1, 1924 by Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig. \n\nThe Great War Veterans' Association and the Newfoundland Patriotic Association launched the campaign to have the National War Memorial established. They developed a committee to establish the design and undertake the fund-raising to pay for the proposed memorial. Construction of the memorial was supervised by Lieutenant-Colonel Father Thomas Nangle, the Roman Catholic Padre of Royal Newfoundland Regiment and (Ret) Captain Gerald (Gerry) Whitty\n\nThe design was semi-circular with a graduated plateau rising from the entrance stairway on Water Street to the cenotaph on Duckworth Street. The five figures were designed by two English sculptors, Ferdinand Victor Blundstone (top and sides) and Gilbert Bayes (front), and were cast in bronze by E.J. Parlanti from London, England. These figures represent Newfoundland's involvement in World War I.\n\nAt the top of the central pedestal is a figure of a woman. It symbolizes Newfoundland's willingness to serve and the spirit of loyalty to the Empire. She is holding a flaming torch in her left hand as a symbol of freedom. In her right hand, she is holding a sword poised and ready to battle, if she must. From the sides of the central pedestal, two wings of granite protrude. On the west wing, representing the Newfoundlanders who joined the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve, is a sailor holding a spyglass. On the east wing, representing the men of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, is a soldier in full battle gear, loading his rifle, searching the horizon for \"the enemy\". \nOut in front, on the lower pedestal, are fishermen in oilskins and Wellington boots, and a lumberman with his axe slung over his shoulder, symbolizing the Newfoundlanders who served with the Merchant Marine and the Forestry Corps. Over their heads is a granite cross symbolizing the sacred nature of the war memorial. Below, is a bronze plaque stating that the memorial was erected by \"\"a grateful people to honour its war dead\"\". Similar plaques were added on both sides of the pedestal to commemorate the Newfoundlanders who died in World War II, the Korean War, and the War in Afghanistan.\n\nEach year the National War Memorial is the site of several ceremonies to commemorate those service personnel who died in past wars. \n\nOn 3 January 1928 Newfoundland issued a postage stamp titled 'War Memorial, St. John's' based on a sculpture by Ferdinand-Victor Blundstone and a sculpture by Gilbert Bayes.

It is a poisonous oily liquid with an extremely unpleasant garlicky odor. Cacodyl undergoes spontaneous combustion in dry air. \n\nCacodyl is also the name of the functional group or radical (CH)As.\n\nA mixture of dicacodyl and cacodyl oxide ((CH)As—O—As(CH)) was first prepared by Cadet by the reaction of potassium acetate with arsenic trioxide. A subsequent reduction yields a mixture of several methylated arsenic compounds including dicacodyl. The reaction forming the oxide is something like:\n\nA far better synthesis was later developed which started from the dimethyl arsine chloride and dimethyl arsine:\n\nRobert Wilhelm Bunsen coined the name kakodyl (later modified to cacodyl in English) for the dimethylarsinyl radical, (CH)As, from the Greek kakodes (evil-smelling) and hyle (matter).\n\nIt was investigated by Edward Frankland and (for over six years) by Robert Bunsen and is considered the earliest organometallic compound ever discovered (even though arsenic is not a true metal).\n\nFrom it other compounds were made, such as cacodyl fluoride, chloride, et cetera. One compound, cacodyl cyanide, was particularly awful. In Bunsen's words \"\"the smell of this body produces instantaneous tingling of the hands and feet, and even giddiness and insensibility...It is remarkable that when one is exposed to the smell of these compounds the tongue becomes covered with a black coating, even when no further evil effects are noticeable\"\". \n\nWork on cacodyl led Bunsen to the postulation of \"methyl radicals\" as part of the then-current radical theory.\n\nCacodyl was used to try to prove the radical theory of Jöns Jacob Berzelius, which resulted in a wide use of cacodyl in research laboratories. Afterward interest in the toxic, malodorous compound decreased. During World War I the use of cacodyl as chemical weapon was considered, but it was never used in the war. Inorganic chemists discovered the properties of cacodyl as a ligand for transition metals.\n\n"}

The other system is the binational TAZARA Railway (TAZARA) that interconnects with the ZR at Kapiri Mposhi and provides a link to the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam.\n\nThe gauge Cape gauge ZR network was built during British colonial rule as part of the vision of the Cape-Cairo railway but the economic spur was to access the mines of Central Africa. The railway started as part of Rhodesian Railways, the company which ran the railways of Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia as an integrated operation, which was one of the largest employers and enterprises in both countries. The railway arrived in the future Zambia early in 1905 when the 150 km Livingstone-Kalomo line was built in advance of completion in September of that year of the Victoria Falls Bridge from the then Southern Rhodesia to Livingstone. The first wagons on the line were hauled by oxen, then a single locomotive was conveyed in pieces by cableway across the gorge where the bridge was being built to start up operations to Kalomo in advance of the main line connection.\n\nAnother major bridge was required to cross the Kafue River and the 427 m long Kafue Railway Bridge, the longest on the Rhodesian Railways or Zambian Railways network was completed in 1906.\n\nThe line reached Broken Hill (Kabwe) in 1906 and Ndola in the Copperbelt in 1909 (connecting to Sakania in the Congo), some 20 years before the first large-scale copper mines opened there.\n\nZambia Railways operates the Mulobezi Railway, a branch line from Livingstone, built as a private timber line.\n\nIn the mid-1960s spurred by the Rhodesian UDI crisis, the newly independent Zambia split its railways off from Rhodesia Railways, and Zambia Railways came into being.\n\nRailway Systems of Zambia Limited (RSZ) is a private company incorporated and registered in Zambia. It is a subsidiary of NLPI Ltd (NLPI), an investment holding company.\n\nThe NLPI Consortium participated in a tender in respect of the Zambia Railways Concession. The Consortium was declared the winner with the signing of the Freight Concession Agreement on 14 February 2003.\n\nThe Concession was to operate for a period of 20 years with a possible extension for a further 10 years. However, in September 2012, the government revoked the concession and Zambia Railways resumed control.\n\nThere are no current international passenger services of the ZR, only of the TAZARA railway. Some tour companies have run special services on the ZR network.\n\nThe Copperbelt reaches into the Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with mines at Lubumbashi and further north-west. The ZR network connects to Lubumbashi via Ndola and Sakania. At one time the Lubumbashi line connected to the Benguela Railway through Angola to Lobito Bay, but the line did not operate from the 1970s, until reopening in 2018.\n\nAs most of its major export routes ran through then apartheid controlled South Africa, Zambia needed an alternate export route for its copper. In 1976, Chinese construction crews completed the 1,860-kilometer-long Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA) which runs from Kapiri Mposhi just north of the Zambian capital Lusaka, to the Tanzanian capital and major east African port of Dar es Salaam. After being operated jointly by the two nationalised railway systems, the Chinese again took over the running of TAZARA in a joint transport agreement from January 2007, which covered both direct air links to Beijing Capital International Airport and copper ore export.\n\nVia Victoria Falls Bridge the Zimbabwe rail network and the ports in Mozambique (Beira, Maputo) and the South African Railways of South Africa can be reached. The condition of the 100-year-old bridge restricts traffic.\n\nUp to the mid-1960s, passenger and sleeper services ran from Ndola to Bulawayo, Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia), connecting with a sleeper service to Cape Town and the Union Castle shipping line to Southampton, UK. This was the main travel route between south-central Africa and Europe before the Jet age. The journey from Ndola to Cape Town took five days.\n\nNdola-Bulawayo passenger services ended when Zambia suspended all services across the Victoria Falls Bridge in response to Rhodesia's UDI crisis. Freight services were occasionally resumed up to the line re-opening in 1980, but successful passenger services have not resumed.\n\nA rail link to the Sena railway between Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia, allowing access to the port of Nacala, was first planned in 1982. On the Malawi side of the border, the line to Mchinji was finished in 1984, but a connection to Chipata in Zambia was only opened in 2010. This line remains idle because there are few facilities at Chipata.\n\n\n\n"}

He is the author of \"Evidence of Harm\" (2005), \"Animal Factory\" (2010), \"Death at Sea World\" (2012), and \"When They Come for You\" (2019).\nKirby has written for many national magazines, including \"Glamour\", \"Redbook\", \"Self\" and \"Mademoiselle\". From 1986 to 1990, Kirby was a foreign correspondent for UPI, and \"Newsday\" (among others) in Latin America, covering wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua, and he covered politics, corruption and natural disasters in Mexico. It was during this time that he was also a reporter for \"OutWeek\".\n\nFrom 1990 to 1993, Kirby was director of public information at the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR), worked for New York City Council President Carol Bellamy, and was a senior staff adviser to David Dinkins' successful 1989 run for mayor of New York City.\n\nIn 1998, Kirby wrote a cover story for \"The Advocate\", \"Does coming out matter?\". From 1998 to 2001, he wrote many articles for \"The Advocate\", including one on the courage of young gay and lesbian scouts and service members.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2004, Kirby contributed several articles on travel to \"The New York Times\", including \"Rainbow Beach Towels on Mexican Sand\", an article on the gay tourism industry in Puerto Vallarta. He has also written on topics other than travel and leisure, including on a new phenomenon, known as \"dirty driving\", the playing pornography on DVD screens inside vehicles while they drive through traffic. The article expressed concern for what children have been exposed to by these \"dirty drivers\". \n\nIn 2005, Kirby's book \"Evidence of Harm - Mercury in Vaccines and the Autism Epidemic: A Medical Controversy\" was published. \n\nSince May 2005, Kirby has been a contributing blogger at \"The Huffington Post\".\n\n\n\"Evidence of Harm\" explores the controversies surrounding thimerosal containing vaccines (TCVs), and whether TCVs have contributed to the apparent increase of autism, ADHD, speech delay and other childhood disorders in the United States. In the book, Kirby tells the personal stories of parents of children who have autism, founders of the advocacy group SafeMinds, including Sallie Bernard, Lyn Redwood, Mark Blaxill, Albert Enayati, Heidi Roger and Liz Birt.\n\n\"Many of the public health officials who discount the thimerosal theory were unwilling to be interviewed for this book (or prohibited from speaking by superiors),\" Kirby later wrote. \"Readers are invited to reach their own conclusions on the evidence.\" Nevertheless, Kirby also acknowledges \"(E)ach side accuses the other of being irrational, overzealous, blind to evidence they find inconvenient, and subject to professional, financial, or emotional conflicts of interest that cloud their judgment.\" Ultimately, Kirby finds the evidence leveled against thimerosal inconclusive but suggestive, and calls urgently for further research.\n\nThe autism-vaccine link has been firmly discredited, including any suggested evidence of a link between thimerosal and autism. The majority of scientific consensus agrees with vast population studies that have shown there to be no link between vaccines, autism, and thimerosal. The original paper by Andrew Wakefield that started a media firestorm and led to fears of vaccination amongst parents has been discredited and research by journalist Brian Deer showed the data used in the paper to be fraudulent. \n\nIn May 2005, \"Evidence of Harm\" was reviewed negatively in the \"British Medical Journal\". The reviewer described Kirby's book as \"woefully one-sided\", and wrote: \"In his determination to provide an account that is sympathetic to the parents, Kirby enters into the grip of the same delusion and ends up in the same angry and paranoid universe into which campaigners have descended, alleging phone taps and other forms of surveillance as they struggle against sinister conspiracies between health authorities and drug companies.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1791605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791605", "title": "Decretum Gratiani", "text": "Decretum Gratiani\n\nThe Decretum Gratiani, also known as the Concordia discordantium canonum or Concordantia discordantium canonum or simply as the Decretum, is a collection of canon law compiled and written in the 12th century as a legal textbook by the jurist known as Gratian. It forms the first part of the collection of six legal texts, which together became known as the \"Corpus Juris Canonici\". It was used by canonists of the Roman Catholic Church until the Decretals, promulgated by Pope Gregory IX in 1234 obtained legal force.\n\nAround 1150 Gratian, teacher of theology at the monastery of Saints Nabor and Felix and sometimes believed to have been a Camaldolese monk, composed the work he called \"Concordia discordantium canonum\", and others titled \"Nova collectio, Decreta, Corpus juris canonici\", or the more commonly accepted name, \"Decretum Gratiani\". He did this to obviate the difficulties which beset the study of practical, external theology (theologia practica externa), i.e., the study of canon law. In spite of its great reputation and wide diffusion, the Decretum has never been recognized by the Church as an official collection.\n\nIt is divided into three parts (\"ministeria, negotia, sacramenta\"). The first part is divided into 101 distinctions (\"distinctiones\"), the first 20 of which form an introduction to the general principles of canon Law (tractatus decretalium); the remainder constitutes a tractatus ordinandorum, relative to ecclesiastical persons and function. The second part contains 36 causes (\"causæ\"), divided into questions (quæstiones), and treat of ecclesiastical administration and marriage; the third question of the 33rd causa treats of the Sacrament of Penance and is divided into 7 distinctions. The third part, entitled \"De consecratione\", treats of the sacraments and other sacred things and contains 5 distinctions. Each distinction or question contains \"dicta Gratiani\", or maxims of Gratian, and canones. Gratian himself raises questions and brings forward difficulties, which he answers by quoting auctoritates, i. e. canons of councils, decretals of the popes, texts of the Scripture or of the Fathers. These are the canones; the entire remaining portion, even the summaries of the canons and the chronological indications, are called the maxims or dicta Gratiani. Many auctoritates have been inserted in the \"Decretum\" by authors of a later date. These are the \"Paleœ\", so called from Paucapalea, the name of the principal commentator on the \"Decretum\". The Roman revisers of the 16th century (1566–82) corrected the text of the \"Decree\" and added many critical notes designated by the words Correctores Romani.\n\nThe \"Decretum\" is quoted by indicating the number of the canon and that of the distinction or of the cause and the question. To differentiate the distinctions of the first part from those of the third, question of the 33rd cause of the second part and those of the third part, the words de Pœn., i. e. \"de Pœnitentiâ\", and de Cons., i. e. \"de Consecratione\" are added to the latter. For instance, \"c. 1. d. XI\" indicates the first part of the \"Decree\". distinction XI, canon 1; \"c. 1., de Pœn., d. VI,\" refers to the second part, 33rd cause, question 3, distinction VI, canon 1; \"c. 8, de Cons., d. II\" refers to the third part, distinction II, canon 8; \"c. 8, C. XII, q. 3\" refers to the second part, cause XII, question 3, canon 8. Sometimes, especially in the case of well-known and much-quoted canons, the first words are also indicated, e. g., c. Si quis suadente diabolo, C. XVII, q. 4, i. e. the 29th canon of the second part, cause XVII, question 4. Occasionally the first words alone are quoted. In both cases, to find the canon it is necessary to consult the alphabetical tables (printed in all editions of Gratian) that contain the first words of every canon.\n\nGratian () was a canon lawyer from Bologna. He flourished in the mid 12th century. Little else is known about him. \n\nHe is sometimes incorrectly referred to as Franciscus Gratianus, Johannes Gratian, or Giovanni Graziano. For a long time he was believed to have been born at the end of the 11th century, at Chiusi in Tuscany. He was said to have become a monk at Camaldoli and then he taught at the monastery of St. Felix in Bologna and devoted his life to studying canon law, but contemporary scholarship does not attach credibility to these traditions.\nSince the 11th century, Bologna had been the centre of the study of canon law, as well as of Roman law, after the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" was rediscovered in western Europe. \nGratian's work was an attempt, using early scholastic method, to solve seemingly contradictory canons from previous centuries. Gratian quoted a great number of authorities, including the Bible, papal and conciliar legislation, church fathers such as Augustine of Hippo, and secular law in his efforts to reconcile the canons. Gratian found a place in Dante's \"Paradise\" among the doctors of the Church: \n\nHe has long been acclaimed as \"Pater Juris Canonici\" (Latin, \"Father of Canon Law\"), a title he shares with his successor St. Raymond of Penyafort.\n\nThe vulgate version of Gratian's collection was completed at some point after the Second Council of the Lateran of 1139, which it quotes. Research by Anders Winroth established that some manuscripts of an early version of Gratian's text, which differs considerably from the mainstream textual tradition, have survived.\nWith later commentaries and supplements, the work was incorporated into the \"Corpus Juris Canonici\". The \"Decretum\" quickly became the standard textbook for students of canon law throughout Europe, but it never received any formal official recognition by the papacy. Only the \"Codex Juris Canonici\" of 1917 put it out of use.\n\nAs late as 1997, scholars commonly set the date of completion at 1140, but this accuracy in dating isn't possible after Anders Winroth's groundbreaking scholarship. Research by Anders Winroth shows that the \"Decretum\" existed in two published recensions. The first dates to sometime after 1139, while the second dates to 1150 at the latest. There are several major differences between the two recensions:\nThese differences led Winroth to conclude that Roman law was not as far developed by 1140 as scholars had previously thought. He has also argued that the second recension was due not to the original author of the first recension (whom he calls Gratian 1), but rather another jurist versed in Roman law. However, Winroth's thesis of two Gratians remains controversial.\nThis field of inquiry is hampered by ignorance of the compiler's identity and the existence of manuscripts with abbreviated versions of the text or variant versions not represented by Winroth's two recensions. One of these is the manuscript St. Gall, Stiftsbibliothek, 673 (=Sg), which some have argued contains the earliest known version (borrador) of the \"Decretum\", but which other scholars have argued contains an abbreviation of the first recension expanded with texts taken from the second recension.\n\nGratian's sources were Roman law, the Bible, the writings of (or attributed to) the Church Fathers, papal decretals, the acts of church councils and synods. In most cases, Gratian did not obtain this material from a direct reading of the sources, but rather through intermediate collections. Thanks to the research of modern scholars - in particular, Charles Munier, Titus Lenherr, and Peter Landau - we now know that Gratian made use of a relatively small number of collections in the composition of most of the \"Decretum\", these being:\n\nOther sources are known to have been used in the composition of particular sections of the \"Decretum\":\n\nGratian himself named his work \"Concordia Discordantium Canonum\" - \"Concord of Discordancies of Canons.\" The name is fitting: Gratian tried to harmonize apparently contradictory canons with each other, by discussing different interpretations and deciding on a solution. This dialectical approach allowed for other law professors to work with the \"Decretum\" and to develop their own solutions and commentaries. These legalists are known as the decretists.\n\nThese commentaries were called glosses. Editions printed in the 15th, 16th or 17th centuries frequently included the glosses along with the text. Collections of glosses were called \"gloss apparatus\" or \"Lectura in Decretum\" (see also glossator). Systematic commentaries were called \"Summae\". Some of these \"Summae\" were soon in circulation as well and obtained the same level of fame as the \"Decretum\" itself. Early commentators included Paucapalea and Magister Rolandus. The most important commentators were probably Rufin of Bologna (died before 1192) and Huguccio (died 1210). Less well-known was the commentary of Simon of Bisignano, which consisted of the \"Glosses on the Decretum\" and the \"Summa Simonis\".\n\nPeter Lombard borrowed and adapted from the \"Decretum\" when discussing penance in his \"Sentences\" (≈1150).\n\nThe \"Decretum\" served as a model for 12th-century jurists in the formation of Western law, based on rational rules and evidence to replace barbaric laws which often involved trial by ordeal or battle.\n\nThe \"Decretum\" has been called \"the first comprehensive and systematic legal treatise in the history of the West, and perhaps in the history of mankind – if by 'comprehensive' is meant the attempt to embrace virtually the entire law of a given polity, and if by 'systematic' is meant the express effort to codify that law as a single body, in which all parts are viewed as interacting to form a whole.\" The \"Decretum\" made a direct contribution to the development of Western law in areas that it dealt with such as marriage, property and inheritance. Specific concepts included consent for marriage, and wrongful intent in determining whether a certain act constituted a crime.\n\n\n"}

Holland was lost when he stayed at his post during the sinking of HMS Hood.\n\nLancelot Holland was one of six sons and a daughter of a doctor who was also a brewer for the firm Hunt Edmunds. He was born in Middleton Cheney and was raised in the Banbury area. He entered the Royal Navy on 15 May 1902. On leaving HMS \"Britannia\" in September 1903, he was drafted to the China Station to join HMS \"Eclipse\". He served in the Far East until August 1905. The latter part of his time there was spent in HMS \"Hampshire\".\n\nReturning home, he saw brief service during the summer of 1908 in the Admiralty surveying ship HMS \"Research\". However, the surveying service proved not to be Holland's forte and three years later on 14 September 1911 the young Lieutenant Holland joined HMS \"Excellent\", the Royal Navy's gunnery school at Whale Island, Portsmouth to start the 'Long Course' which would qualify him as a lieutenant (G).\n\nHaving qualified as a gunnery lieutenant and gone on to take the advanced gunnery course at Greenwich, Holland spent the First World War in a teaching role aboard HMS \"Excellent\". After the war he was promoted to commander on 31 December 1919 and captain on 30 June 1926.\n\nDuring the period May 1929 to February 1931, Holland was flag captain to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, aboard HMS \"Hawkins\". From May 1931 to September 1932, Holland headed the British Naval Mission to Greece. He was subsequently flag captain aboard the battleship HMS \"Revenge\" from July 1934 to July 1935.\n\nAfter a 1937 stint as naval ADC to King George VI, he was promoted to Rear admiral and became commander of the 3rd Battle Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet in January 1938, flying his flag in HMS \"Resolution\" and then commander of the 2nd Battle Squadron, in August 1939 he was appointed Rear-Admiral, Commanding, Channel Force in September 1939. He then became Admiralty representative at the Air Ministry. He was promoted to Vice Admiral backdated to Aug 1940 after commanding Cruiser Force H during the Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 Nov 1940.\n\nFrom July 1940, Holland commanded the 7th Cruiser Squadron, serving in the Mediterranean. During the course of this command he led his cruisers in the Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November 1940.\n\nBy this time, Holland had established himself as a gunnery specialist.\n\nHolland's next assignment was in command of the Battlecruiser Squadron. In May 1941, the new German battleship \"Bismarck\" attempted to break out into the North Atlantic, accompanied by the heavy cruiser \"Prinz Eugen\". Their mission was to attack Allied convoys. Holland flew his flag aboard \"Hood\", which was accompanied by the new battleship HMS \"Prince of Wales\". On 22 May, just after midnight, \"Electra\", \"Achates\", \"Antelope\", \"Anthony\", \"Echo\", and \"Icarus\", escorting the \"Hood\" and \"Prince Of Wales\", sailed to cover the northern approaches. The intention was that the force would refuel in Hvalfjord, Iceland, and then sail again to watch the Denmark Strait. On the evening of 23 May, the weather deteriorated. At 20:55, Admiral Holland aboard the \"Hood\" signalled the destroyers \"If you are unable to maintain this speed I will have to go on without you. You should follow at your best speed.\" At 02:15 on the morning of 24 May, the destroyers were ordered to spread out at 15 mile intervals to search to the north.\n\nAt about 05:35, the German forces were sighted by the \"Hood\" and, shortly afterwards, the Germans sighted the British ships. In the ensuing Battle of the Denmark Strait the \"Hood\" suffered a catastrophic magazine explosion at 06:01 that broke the ship in half; the admiral and all but three of the crew of 1,418 were lost. One of the survivors, Ted Briggs, later stated he last saw Holland sitting in his admiral's chair, in utter dejection, making no attempt to escape from the sinking wreck.\n\n\"Prince of Wales\" made her escape with some damage, including a hit on her bridge which killed many of her officers. One of the salvos from \"Prince of Wales\" damaged \"Bismarck\"s fuel tanks, and prompted her to make for occupied France.\n\nHolland was posthumously Mentioned in Despatches.\n\nAdmiral Holland was married to Phyllis and had one son, John, who died of polio at the age of 18 in 1935.\n\nAdmiral Holland and his family attended the Anglican parish Church of St John the Baptist at Boldre in the New Forest, Hampshire, England. They had a memorial to their son installed there and later a Hood Memorial Chapel was dedicated. An annual memorial service is held to remember Admiral Holland and the crew of the \"Hood\". A public house in Banbury, The Admiral Holland, was named after him. This pub was demolished in May 2017.\n\n\n"}

It is situated on the north flank of Aspen Mountain (for which it is named) at an elevation of . Aspen Mountain forms the end of Richmond Ridge, a long ridge that extends 10 miles south at approximately to join the main spine of the Elk Mountains.\n\nFounded in 1946 by Walter Paepcke, Aspen was the first ski area venture of the Aspen Skiing Company. It is one of four adjacent ski areas operated by the company as part of the Aspen/Snowmass complex. At only , it is somewhat small compared to other ski areas, especially compared to the much larger nearby Snowmass ski area, and retains a unique cultural flavor that harkens to the earlier days of recreational skiing in the state. The ski area is located within the White River National Forest and is operated under permit from the U.S. Forest Service. It has three restaurants on the mountain; two are on top (one of which is a club that only allows members) and one mid-mountain.\n\nPrior to 1946, the mountain had been the site of skiing using a crude boat lift, and by the use of the jeep trails up the back side of the mountain on Midnight Mine Road. In 1941, Aspen's first national downhill and slalom championships were held March 8–9. Fritz Benedict visited Aspen for the first time, the father of the 10th Mountain Hut and Trail System. The foundation of the ski area in 1946 was accomplished with the installation of the single-seat chairlift, Lift-1. When it began operations on December 14, 1946, it was the longest chairlift in the world. Many of the first employees were veterans of the 10th Mountain Division, which had trained at Camp Hale, including Friedl Pfeifer of Austria and Pete Seibert. Before the war, Pfeifer had headed the ski school at Sun Valley and did the same at Aspen; Seibert was a member of the Aspen ski patrol would later found Vail Mountain (in 1962). In its fourth season, Aspen hosted the 1950 World Championships, the first world championships held outside of Europe, and the first since 1939.\n\nLift-1 ran until 1972, when it was replaced by two double chairlifts, Shadow Mountain (commonly referred to as 1A) and Ruthie's. Access to the mountain was radically changed in 1986 with the installation of the Silver Queen Gondola, which ascends to the summit up the east side of the area with a vertical rise of . The area's lifts also include 1 high-speed quad, 1 high-speed double, 2 quads, and 3 doubles.\n\nThe gondola is one of two lifts, along with the Little Nell chairlift, which ascend from Gondola Plaza in the heart of the downtown Aspen. The configuration allows visitors to ascend the mountain from the center of town, and ski down the Little Nell Run back into town. The mountainside contains hidden and open remains of the intense silver mining activity from the Colorado Silver Boom in the late 1880s and early 1890s. In January 2001, it was decided to end Aspen Mountain's long-time ban on snowboarding. However, as a courtesy to season-pass holders, the resort was not officially opened to snowboarders until April 1, 2001.\nThe longest run is 3 miles (4.8 km) and the lift capacity is 10,755 riders per hour. The average annual snowfall is 300 inches (7.6 m). It has snowmaking capabilities of 210 acres (0.84 km²), which comprises approximately one-third of the area. The mountain is considered moderate-to-difficult with no \"green\" (beginner) runs. Its sister mountain, Aspen Highlands, also has no beginner terrain as of December 2017. Novice skiers must go to Snowmass or Buttermilk. Approximately 26% of the terrain is considered expert. The season on the mountain ranges from late November to early April. It is typically the last area, along with nearby Snowmass, in the resort complex to close for the winter.\n\nThe ski area has a unique \"homespun\" culture that dates from its early foundation as part of the Utopian social experiment in Aspen created by Walter Paepcke in the 1940s, retaining somewhat of a throwback culture in comparison to the other three areas of the complex. The culture is reflected in the numerous homemade memorials and tributes that dot the trees of mountains created in honor of famous personages such as John Denver and Hunter S. Thompson.\n\nIt is rumored that under the Bell Mountain lift on Aspen Mountain was the home of the first Panty tree of bras, panties, thongs, and Mardi Gras necklaces as early as the late 1950s.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1791621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791621", "title": "Prince Iaukea", "text": "Prince Iaukea\n\nMichael Laauli Hayner (born August 1, 1964) is an American semi retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling from 1995 to 2000 under the ring name Prince Iaukea and later The Artist Formerly Known as Prince Iaukea or simply The Artist.\n\nHayner made his WCW debut in 1996 and mainly competed as a fan favorite underdog. He was utilized as an enhancement talent during the early months of his career before winning the World Television Championship in 1997 and holding the title for nearly two months. Hayner then fell into the ranks due to some issues with management before being repackaged as \"The Artist\". He dominated the cruiserweight division during the first half of 2000, winning the company's Cruiserweight Championship twice before departing the company later that year.\n\nAfter being trained by Dean Malenko and Rico Federico, Hayner made his first appearance in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) at the 1995 Fall Brawl pay-per-view as a cadet delivering papers to Cobra for Craig Pittman. Later, Kevin Sullivan brought him to some television tapings and was so impressed by his professionalism, overall attitude, and respect for the business that Sullivan gave him the \"Iaukea\" name taken from King Curtis Iaukea, a good friend of Sullivan. Hayner was thus given the ring name \"Prince Iaukea\".\n\nHayner made his first appearance in WCW on the May 18, 1996 episode of \"Saturday Night\", where he teamed with Rick Fargo as enhancement talents against Chris Benoit and Kevin Sullivan. He made his official television debut as the fan favorite \"Prince Iaukea\" on the June 1 episode of \"Saturday Night\", where he defeated The Gambler. Two days later, Iaukea made his \"Monday Nitro\" debut with a loss to Kevin Sullivan and then remained a jobber to the stars for the remainder of the year. He made his pay-per-view debut at November's World War 3 as a participant in the World War 3 battle royal for a future title shot at the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, but failed to win. He quickly made a name for himself with his unique Samoan persona and real submission wrestling skills along with solid pro wrestling ability. The common pronunciation of his ring name came about by the mispronunciation from WCW announcer Tony Schiavone. Prince Iaukea also received blessing from King Curtis Iaukea during a phone conversation with King Curtis telling him that \"he was family\" and that he enjoyed the work that Prince was doing.\n\nOn the February 17, 1997 episode of \"Nitro\", Iaukea captured the World Television Championship by defeating Lord Steven Regal after capitalizing on a distraction caused by Regal's scheduled pay-per-view opponent Rey Misterio, Jr. Iaukea successfully defended the title against Misterio, six days later at February's SuperBrawl VII and Uncensored. Iaukea began feuding with Regal and made a successful title defense against Regal at Spring Stampede, but was assaulted by Regal after the match. The following night, on \"Nitro\", Iaukea attempted to rescue Misterio from an assault by Regal but ended up suffering a \"Regal Stretch\" and suffered a rib injury, leading him to drop the title to Último Dragón later that night. After his title loss, Iaukea received a title shot against Syxx for the Cruiserweight Championship and unsuccessfully tried to regain the World Television Championship from Lord Steven Regal on the May 19 episode of \"Nitro\" and Último Dragón on the July 28 episode of \"Nitro\".\n\nHayner continued to compete as a mid-carder before going on tour with WCW's working partner New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) during the month of October, where he competed with established greats such as Shinjiro Otani and Koji Kanemoto. NJPW booker Riki Choshu was a huge supporter of Hayner. Hayner returned to WCW television as a participant in the World War 3 at the eponymous pay-per-view on November 23. He would then float around the lower mid-card for several years, mainly because of an alleged romantic link between Hayner and the wife of an upper level WCW executive. Hayner denied the allegations, but the rumor persisted.\n\nHe briefly feuded with Chris Jericho in early 1998 due to Jericho degrading Hayner's trainer Dean Malenko and Hayner stepped in to defend Malenko's honor. He unsuccessfully challenged Jericho for the Cruiserweight Championship at Spring Stampede. After the match, Jericho stole Iaukea's Hawaiian dress. He went on a hiatus and returned to the company on the October 8 episode of \"Thunder\" against Kanyon in a losing effort. He then lost to Norman Smiley at the company's premier pay-per-view Starrcade on December 27, 1998.\n\nAfter spending most of 1999 as a low-carder and being left off pay-per-view events, Hayner was repackaged as a villain on the December 6, 1999 episode of \"Monday Nitro\" as \"The Artist Formerly Known as Prince Iaukea\", a character based on singer Prince. He was soon then given a valet named Paisley and his ring name was shortened to simply \"The Artist\". In 2000, Artist entered a tournament for the vacant Cruiserweight Championship. He defeated Kid Romeo, Kaz Hayashi and Lash LeRoux at SuperBrawl 2000 to win the vacant title. Artist successfully defended the title against Psychosis at the following month's Uncensored pay-per-view, before losing the title to Billy Kidman at a live event on March 30, only to regain it from Kidman on March 31. All the WCW titles were vacated by Vince Russo on April 10 when Russo and Eric Bischoff \"re-launched\" WCW. The Artist was then placed in a six-way match for the vacant title at Spring Stampede, in which he was pinned by Chris Candido. As a result, Artist began a rivalry with Candido and received a title shot at Slamboree, where he failed to win the title. This would be Hayner's last pay-per-view appearance in the company. Hayner was released in August 2000, his last televised match being a loss to Big Vito on the August 19 episode of \"WorldWide\".\n\nFollowing his WCW release he wrestled the independent scene traveling around the country for various promotions. He was briefly known as The Tongan Prince for Jimmy Hart's X Wrestling Federation, but when that went under he used his military background and went to work for a security contractor overseas. In 2007 he started 3SX Entertainment (Samoan Strong Style Xtreme Wrestling and Entertainment) in American Samoa where work on a Pro Wrestling and MMA Dojo is ongoing.\n\nHe won the NWA Florida Junior Heavyweight title of the Floridan promotion Pro Wrestling Fusion by defeating Chris Jones on November 29, 2008, and held it for 6 months before losing it back to Chris Jones, but he rebounded and received a Heavyweight title shot against Steve Madison only to lose a close contest.\n\nIaukea's last match to date took place on October 17, 2015, unsuccessfully challenging for the Great Malenko Cup against Big O.\n\nHayner appeared as \"Prince Iaukea\" alongside several other WCW wrestlers in the 2000 movie \"Ready to Rumble\".\n\nHayner is married to Georgette and has a son who wrestles professionally under the name of Nick Primo. Hayner and his son both currently work for Pro Wrestling Fusion, New Florida Wrestling (NFW), and Definitive Wrestling International (DWI); all are Florida based independent wrestling promotions.\n\n\n"}

For this reason, railway spine is often known as Erichsen's disease.\n\nRailway collisions were a frequent occurrence in the early 19th century. Exacerbating the problem was the fact that railway cars were flimsy, wooden structures with no protection for the occupants.\n\nSoon a group of people started coming forward who claimed that they had been injured in train crashes, but had no obvious evidence of injury. The railroads rejected these claims as fake.\n\nThe nature of symptoms caused by \"railway spine\" was hotly debated in the late 19th century, notably at the meetings of the (Austrian) Imperial Society of Physicians in Vienna, 1886. Germany's leading neurologist, Hermann Oppenheim, claimed that all railway spine symptoms were due to physical damage to the spine or brain, whereas French and British scholars, notably Jean-Martin Charcot and Herbert Page, insisted that some symptoms could be caused by hysteria (now known as conversion disorder).\n\nErichsen observed that those most likely to be injured in a railway crash were those sitting with their backs to the acceleration. This is the same injury mechanism found in whiplash. As with automobile accidents, railway and airplane accidents are now known to cause posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychosomatic symptoms in addition to physical trauma.\n\n"}

{"id": "1791647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791647", "title": "Dingo Fence", "text": "Dingo Fence\n\nThe Dingo Fence or Dog Fence is a pest-exclusion fence that was built in Australia during the 1880s and finished in 1885, to keep dingoes out of the relatively fertile south-east part of the continent (where they had largely been exterminated) and protect the sheep flocks of southern Queensland. It is one of the longest structures in the world. It stretches from Jimbour on the Darling Downs near Dalby through thousands of kilometres of arid land ending west of Eyre peninsula on cliffs of the Nullarbor Plain above the Great Australian Bight near Nundroo. It has been partly successful, though dingoes can still be found in parts of the southern states. Although the fence has helped reduce losses of sheep to predators, this has been countered by holes in fences found in the 1990s through which dingo offspring have passed and by increased pasture competition from rabbits and kangaroos.\n\nThe section of the fence in Queensland is also known as the Great Barrier Fence or Wild Dog Barrier Fence 11. It is administered by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The Wild Dog Barrier Fence staff consists of 23 employees, including two-person teams that patrol a section of the fence once every week. There are depots at Quilpie and Roma.\n\nThe Queensland Border Fence stretches for westwards along the border with New South Wales, into the Strzelecki Desert. The fence passes the point where the three states of Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia meet (Cameron Corner). At this point, it connects with the South Australian Border Fence, which runs for southwards along the border with New South Wales. It then joins a section known as the Dog Fence in South Australia, which is long.\n\nThe fence varies in construction. Mostly it is made of high wire mesh but some sections in South Australia comprise multi-strand electric fence . The fence line on both sides is cleared to a width. Sheep and cattle stations in Australia protected by the fence are astoundingly large. While varying in size, some stations can be larger than small countries. One station alone in South Australia lost over 11,000 sheep in a year due to dingo attacks before the completion of the fence. As recently as 1991, one station lost 3000 sheep in a year . Sheep farmers fought back by using poisoning, shooting, and eventually constructing the longest fence in the world. Aerial poison bait drops are still used today.\n\nParts of the Dingo Fence are lit at night by cold cathode fluorescent lamps which are alternately red and white. They are powered by long life batteries which are charged by photovoltaic cells during the day. At minor and farm crossings, a series of gates allow vehicles to pass through the fence. Where the fence intersects major roads and highways, cattle grids are used to allow high-speed vehicles through.\n\nThe earliest pest exclusion fences in Australia were created to protect small plots of cropland from the predation by marsupials. In the 1860s and 1870s, introduced rabbit populations began to spread rapidly across southern Australia. By 1884, a rabbit-proof fence was built. Having been unsuccessful at keeping rabbits out, and more successful at keeping out pigs, kangaroos, emus and brumbies, and as more sheep farms were established, the interest for a dingo-proof barrier increased enough that government funds were being used to heighten and expand the fence. In 1930, an estimated 32,000 km of dog netting in Queensland alone was being used on top of rabbit fences. Prior to 1948, the idea of a Dingo Barrier Fence Scheme had not come into fruition as a statewide project for which annual maintenance and repair were kept. Since this time, there have been pushes to move away from a method of barrier-exclusion to complete extinction of the dingo and wild-dog cross-breeds. Poisoning the species with compound 1080 (sodium monofluoroacetate) baits has been seen as a much cheaper alternative than fence maintenance. A compromise in the form of the continued use of poison and the shortening of the fence from its previous length of over 8000 km has been made.\n\nIn 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the dingo fence was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an iconic \"innovation and invention\".\n\nIt seems that there are fewer kangaroos and emus on the northwestern side of the fence where the dingoes are, suggesting that the dingoes' presence reduces the populations of those animals.\nIt has also been suggested that the larger kangaroo populations inside the fence have been caused by the lack of dingo predation, and competition for food leads to lower sheep stocking rates than would be possible without the fence.\n\nBelieved to have been introduced into Australia by Aboriginals between 4,600 and 18,300 years ago, the dingo's status as a native or introduced species in Australia has been a controversy. According to Dr. Mike Letnic, at the Centre for Ecosystem Science, UNSW, the dingo, as Australia's top predator, has an important role in maintaining the balance of nature and that reintroduced or existing dingo populations could increase biodiversity across more than 2 million square kilometres of Australia (Avolia 2009). Where dingoes had been exterminated, Dr. Letnic found increased abundances of introduced red foxes and herbivores, while small native mammals and grasses were lost. In 2011 the Liberal MP for Stuart, Dan van Holst Pellekaan, called for a $200 bounty on dingos.\n\nAlthough the fence has helped reduce the loss of sheep to predators, the exclusion of dingoes has allowed for increased pasture competition from rabbits, kangaroos and emus. Sheep are being lost to increasing numbers of feral dogs.\n\n"}

He is the son of Donald Bomann and Bitsy Nebauer, who divorced during his childhood. Atkins was an aspiring baseball player; when his baseball aspirations were derailed by knee problems, he started a modeling career. When he began acting, Atkins dropped the last name Bomann and used his middle name, Atkins, as his last name.\n\nA friend suggested that Atkins audition for \"The Blue Lagoon\". Atkins won the role over thousands of other actors; the film's director, Randal Kleiser, has said that Atkins was a sailing instructor with no acting experience when he was cast in the film. In the film, he and co-star Brooke Shields played two teenaged cousins who find love while living in an isolated tropical paradise after being marooned as children. Released in 1980, the film grossed over $58 million with a production cost of $4.5 million but received a negative critical response. Atkins appeared nude (including frontal nudity) in the film, and spent much of the film wearing a loincloth. While \"Blue Lagoon\" was controversial due to its nude scenes and sexual content, it nevertheless became a \"pop culture phenomenon\". Atkins was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture – Male for \"The Blue Lagoon\". \nAtkins posed nude for \"Playgirl\" in 1982. He went on to star with Kristy McNichol in \"The Pirate Movie\" (1982), an update of Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta \"The Pirates of Penzance\". His song \"How Can I Live Without Her\", which peaked at #71 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, was played in the film. Atkins portrayed Rick Monroe, a college student working as an exotic dancer, in \"A Night in Heaven\" (1983); he won the 1983 Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for his performance. For one season (1983–1984), Atkins had a recurring role as camp counselor Peter Richards on \"Dallas\".\n\nAtkins appeared in the television sitcom \"Suddenly Susan\", which starred Shields, in 1999. In 2009, Atkins appeared on VH1's \"Confessions of a Teen Idol\", a reality show featuring former teen idols. He has been ranked no. 76 on VH1's list of 100 Greatest Teen Stars.\n\nAtkins became a luxury pool builder. He also developed the Christopher Atkins Strike Jacket E.F.L. (Extreme Fishing Lure)--\"a rubbery slipcovering for traditional baits\"--with the assistance of special-effects expert Mark Viniello.\n\nAtkins married Lyn Barron Weber of Sydney, Australia, on May 25, 1985. The couple have two children: Son Grant Bomann and daughter Brittney Bomann. The couple divorced in 2007.\n\nIn a 2009 interview, Atkins acknowledged his past struggle with alcoholism and stated that he had been sober for 22 years.\n\n"}

He had a leading role in the development of Britain's nuclear programme, a clandestine programme started in 1942 during World War II which produced the first British atomic bomb in 1952.\n\nAs the head of the British delegation working in the Manhattan Project, Penney initially carried out calculations to predict the damage effects generated by the blast wave of an atomic bomb. Upon returning home, Penney directed Britain's own nuclear weapons directorate, codename \"Tube Alloys\", and directed scientific research at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment which resulted in the first detonation of a British nuclear bomb, (codename \"Operation Hurricane\") in 1952. After the test, Penney became chief adviser to the newly created British government's United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). He was later chairman of the authority, which he used in international negotiations to control nuclear testing with the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n\nPenney's notable scientific contributions included the mathematics for complex wave dynamics, both in shock and gravity waves, proposing optimization problems and solutions in hydrodynamics (which plays a major role in materials science and metallurgy.) During his later years, Penney lectured in mathematics and physics, and was tenured as the Rector of the Imperial College London until his death.\n\nWilliam George \"Bill\" Penney was born in Gibraltar on 24 June 1909. His father, William A. Penney, was a sergeant-major in the British Army's Ordnance Corps who was then serving overseas. His mother was Blanche Evelyn Johnson. Young William was raised in Sheerness, Kent, and was educated at Sheerness Technical School for Boys from 1924 to 1926, where he displayed a talent for science. He then attended the local technical school in Colchester, the Gilberd School, where he completed his technical studies.\n\nIn 1927, his passion for science landed him in a local science laboratory where he worked as an assistant which helped him to gain a scholarship to study science at Imperial College of Science. He applied and was admitted to the Imperial College Faculty of Natural Sciences where he began taking courses on mathematics, particularly courses on Linear Algebra, Calculus, Partial differential equations and differential geometry. His talent was recognised by the Governor's Prize for Mathematics from the faculty of science. In 1929 Penney graduated, obtaining the B.Sc. in Mathematics with First Class Honours at age 20. Penney was admitted to the post-graduate department that year, and earned his M.Sc. in mathematics in 1931. Then he was offered a research position at the London University, where he studied for a doctorate. In 1932, Penney was awarded the Ph.D. in Mathematics after submitting his doctoral thesis containing work on optimization and cross section of the physical properties of solid-state crystals.\n\nPenney accepted a Commonwealth Fund Fellowship and first traveled to United States where he became foreign research associate at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, returning to England soon after. In England, Penney was granted the 1851 Exhibition Scholarship to attend Trinity College, Cambridge. He changed his mathematical career to physics, and conducted a thorough research and theoretical investigation into the structure of metals and the magnetic properties of crystals.\n\nIn 1935, Penney submitted his final thesis and obtained a D.Sc. in Mathematical Physics from the University of Cambridge; his thesis contained the fundamental work in the applications of quantum mechanics to the physics of crystals. In 1936, he was elected to the Stokes studentship at Pembroke College, Cambridge, but in the same year he returned to London and was appointed Reader in Mathematics at Imperial College London, a post he held from 1936 to 1945. As a recognized prodigy at Imperial College he was set for a distinguished academic career until World War II intervened.\n\nAt the start of World War II, Penney's leading-edge research into the applications of physics was noticed, and he was offered a research position with the Royal Navy. He had made significant contributions to the application of collisions, explosion events that created shock waves, and applications involving military use of hydrodynamics and gravity waves. The Admiralty and Home Office asked Penney to investigate problems connected with the properties of under-water blast waves from high explosives, a subject of great importance in designing ships and torpedoes. With Royal Navy engineer officers he designed and supervised development of the Mulberry harbours to be placed off the Normandy beaches during the D-Day invasion. These mobile breakwaters would protect the landing craft and troops from the Atlantic rollers. In 1943, he was released from his Royal Navy work, and went to the physics faculty of the Imperial College London, his alma mater.\n\nThen he joined Tube Alloys the secret nuclear weapon directorate, and shortly before D-Day in 1944, Penney was made head of the British delegation to the Manhattan Project, when a large team of British scientists joined the American atomic bomb project. Penney and others went to the Los Alamos Laboratory.\n\nAt Los Alamos Penney worked on the use of the atomic bomb, particularly the height at which it should be detonated. He quickly gained recognition for his scientific talents, and also for his leadership qualities and ability to work in harmony with others. Within a few weeks of his arrival he was added to the core group of scientists making key decisions in the direction of the program. Other members of that team included J. Robert Oppenheimer, John von Neumann, Norman F. Ramsey and Captain William Parsons of the United States Navy (USN).\n\nOne of Penney's assignments at Los Alamos was to predict the damage effects from the blast wave of an atomic bomb. On 16 July 1945, Penney was an observer at the Trinity test detonation. He was there to observe the effect of radiant heating in igniting structural materials, and had also designed apparatus to monitor the blast effect of the explosions. The Americans considered him to be among the five most distinguished British contributors to the work. General Leslie Groves, overall director of the Manhattan Project, later wrote:\n\nPenney went to Washington for a top secret committee target selection meeting. He recommended Hiroshima and Nagasaki because of the hills surrounding the target which he said would create maximum devastation. He gave valuable advice regarding the height of the bomb detonation which would ensure optimum destructive effects, whilst ensuring the fireball did not touch the earth, thereby avoiding permanent radiation contamination on the ground. The U.S. nuclear team repeatedly attempted to recruit Penney as a permanent member, without success.\n\nAlong with RAF Group Captain Leonard Cheshire, he accompanied the American Team to Tinian Island from which the Hiroshima and Nagasaki missions were flown. On 9 August 1945 he witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki. The US authorities had controversially stopped them seeing the Hiroshima detonation, but at the last minute Penney and Cheshire were granted permission to fly in the B-29 \"Big Stink\", one of the observation planes that accompanied the Nagasaki weapon delivery bomber \"Bockscar\". Due to the belated permission, \"Big Stink\" missed its rendezvous with the bomber at Nagasaki. They saw the Nagasaki detonation from the air at a distance. As the leading expert on the effects of nuclear weapons, Penney was a member of the team of scientists and military analysts who entered Hiroshima and Nagasaki following the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945 to assess the effects of nuclear weapons.\n\nAt the end of the war the British government, now under Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee, believed that America would share the technology that British leaders saw as a joint discovery under the terms of the 1943 Quebec Agreement. In December 1945 PM Attlee ordered the construction of an atomic pile to produce plutonium and requested a report to detail requirements for Britain's atomic bombs. Penney returned to England and intended to resume his academic career, but was approached by C. P. Snow and asked to take up post as Chief Superintendent Armament Research (CSAR, called \"Caesar\") at Fort Halstead in Kent, as he suspected Britain was going to have to build an atomic bomb of its own and the government wanted Penney in this job. As CSAR he was responsible for all types of armaments research.\n\nIn 1946, at the request of General Leslie Groves and the US Navy, Penney returned to the United States where he was put in charge of the blast effects studies for Operation Crossroads. In July, he was present at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands and wrote the after action reports on the effects of the two nuclear detonations. His reputation was further enhanced when, after the sophisticated test gauges failed, he was able to determine the blast power using observations from simple devices (empty oil drums).\n\nHowever the passing of the McMahon Act (Atomic Energy Act) by the Truman administration in August 1946 made it clear that Britain would be no longer be allowed access to US atomic research. Penney left the United States and returned to England where he initiated his plans for an Atomics Weapons Section, submitting them to the Lord Portal (Marshal of the Royal Air Force) in November 1946. During the winter of 1946–1947, Penney returned to the United States, where he served as a scientific adviser to the British representative at the American Atomic Energy Commission. With almost all other aspects of atomic co-operation between the countries at an end, Penney's personal role was seen as keeping the contact alive between the parties.\n\nAttlee's government decided that Britain required the atomic bomb to maintain its position in world politics. In the words of Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin - \"\"We've got to have it and it's got to have a bloody Union Jack on it.\"\" Officially, the decision to proceed with the British atomic bomb project was made in January 1947 - however arrangements were already under way. The necessary plutonium was on order from Harwell and in the Armaments Research Department of the Ministry of Supply, an Atomic Weapons Section was being organised. The project was based at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich and was code-named \"High Explosive Research\" (or HER).\n\nIn May 1947, Penney was officially named to head the HER project. The following month Penney began assembling teams of scientists and engineers to work on the new technologies that had to be developed. In June 1947, Penney gathered his fledgling team in the library at the Royal Arsenal and gave a two-hour talk on the principles of the atomic bomb. Centred at Fort Halstead, the work proceeded on schedule. In 1950, the first bomb was expected to be ready within two years and would require a test.\n\nThe research was spread across several test facilities in the UK, with confusing lines of authority and responsibility. The bomb design was also complex and innovative; although it started off with the Nagasaki bomb design, completely new methods of arming and of electrical detonation were used. It was realized that a single site was required, and in April 1950 an abandoned World War II airfield, RAF Aldermaston in Berkshire was selected as the permanent home for the British nuclear weapons programme. In 1951 the first scientific staff arrived at Aldermaston, and soon after the HER project vacated the Royal Arsenal. On 3 October 1952, under the code-name \"Operation Hurricane\", the first British nuclear device was successfully detonated off the west coast of Australia in the Monte Bello Islands.\n\nPenney was also aware of the public relations issues associated with the tests, and made clear-speaking presentations to the Australian press. Before one series of tests the Australian High Commissioner described his press presence: \"Sir William Penney has established in Australia a reputation which is quite unique: his appearance, his obvious sincerity and honesty, and the general impression he gives that he would rather be digging his garden – and would be, but for the essential nature of his work – have made him a public figure of some magnitude in Australian eyes\".\n\nIn 1954, nuclear development was transferred from the Ministry of Supply (MoS) to the newly formed United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). From 1954 to 1967, Sir William served on the UKAEA Board, becoming Chairman in 1962.\n\nIn the mid 1950s Britain felt the need to quickly develop megaton class weapons because it seemed that atmospheric testing could soon be outlawed by treaty. As a result, the UK wanted to demonstrate its ability to manufacture megaton class weapons by proof-testing them before any legal prohibitions were in place. According to an article in \"New Scientist\", Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was also hoping to convince the US to change the McMahon Act, which prohibited sharing information even with the British, by demonstrating that the UK had the technology to make a thermonuclear weapon (an H-bomb), and he put Penney in charge of developing this bomb. The Orange Herald bomb was developed and was passed off as a thermonuclear bomb, when in fact it was a boosted fission weapon in which little of the energy came from fusion. The test of this weapon was successful in convincing the Americans to allow information sharing with the British.\n\nLord Penney was Rector of Imperial College London from 1967 to 1973. The college built and named the William Penney Laboratory in his honour in 1987. In 1957 he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of Imperial College but failed to turn up to be formally presented with the document, which was eventually sent to him by post.\n\nIn later years he admitted to qualms about his work but felt it was necessary. When aggressively questioned by the McClelland Royal Commission investigating the test programmes at Monte Bello and Maralinga in 1985, he acknowledged that at least one of the 12 tests probably had unsafe levels of fallout. However, he maintained that due care was taken and that the tests conformed to the internationally accepted safety standards of the time, a position which was confirmed from official records by Lorna Arnold. McClelland broadly accepted Penney's view but anecdotal evidence to the contrary received wide coverage in the press. By promoting a more Australian nationalist view, then current in the government of Bob Hawke, McClelland had also identified \"villains\" in the previous Australian and British administrations. As a senior witness Penney bore the brunt of the allegations, and his health was badly affected by the experience. He died a few years later at his home in the village of East Hendred, aged 81.\n\nIn his obituary in the \"New York Times\" he was credited as the father of the British atomic bomb. \"The Guardian\" described him as its \"guiding light\", and his scientific and administrative leadership was said to be crucial in its successful and timely creation. His leadership of the team that exploded the first British hydrogen bomb at Christmas Island was instrumental in restoring the exchange of nuclear technology between Britain and the USA in 1958, and he was credited as playing a leading part in the negotiations which led to the treaty forbidding atmospheric nuclear tests in 1963.\n\nHis Kronig-Penney model for the behaviour of an electron in a periodic potential is still taught and used today in solid-state physics, and is used to explain the origin of band gaps.\n\nDuring his lifetime William Penney was made a Commonwealth Fund Fellow at University of Wisconsin–Madison (1932); Fellow of the Royal Society (1946); Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1970). Among the honours he received was the Rumford Medal by the Royal Society (1966). He was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) by the University of Bath in 1966. For services to the United States, he was one of the first recipients of the United States Medal of Freedom (with Silver Palm), awarded by President Harry S. Truman. For his services to Britain he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE; 1946); raised to Knight Commander of the order (KBE; 1952); made a life peer, taking the title Baron Penney, of East Hendred in the Royal County of Berkshire (7 July 1967); awarded the Order of Merit (OM; 1969). He served on the board of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (from 1954 to 1967) and became its Chairman (1962–1967). In 1974 he chaired a committee assessing the need for an expert group to be set up to advise and warn the engineering profession on matters of structural safety, which reported positively, and he served as the first chairman of the UK's Standing Committee on Structural Safety from 1976 to 1982.\n\n\n\n"}

It has over of passages in two rock layers and is being resurveyed and remapped by volunteers.\n\nAbout 450 million years ago sedimentary rocks were deposited as the land was intermittently covered by shallow seas that transgressed and regressed. Over the eons the alternating deposits of mud and oceanic debris were compressed to form limestone, shale and sandstone layers. Today these layers are above sea level. Within the last 500,000 to 1,000,000 years, flood waters dissolved along fractures in the limestone bedrock to create most of the cave. Acidic rainwater also sculpted the land above and around the cave, creating thousands of sinkholes and other karst features in the surrounding county.\n\nThe park contains a range of wildlife, from relatively rare species such as glacial snails and timber rattlesnakes to common species such as deer, raccoon, beaver, two species of fox, mink, opossum, woodchuck, and four species of squirrels. Coyotes howl at dusk. Numerous reptiles and amphibians are present. At least 175 species of birds have also been recorded. The South Branch of the Root River contains brown trout, brook trout, and rainbow trout.\n\nThe Minnesota Historical Society operates Historic Forestville as a living museum set in 1899. Costumed interpreters portray Forestville residents and go about daily activities in the general store, house, kitchen, farm, and barn.\n\nForestville was a rural trade center in the 1800s that declined after the railroad was built elsewhere in 1868. Thomas Meighen, son of one of the town's founders, owned the entire village by 1890, including the general store, and the local residents worked on his property for housing and credit in the store.\n\nAdmission to Historic Forestville is separate from the caves. Historic Forestville is open from May through October.\n\n"}

Produced by Massive Attack and Neil Davidge, it saw the duo expanding their trip hop sound to electronica stylings, with diverse influences from new wave, rock, hip hop, and dub music.\n\n\"Mezzanine\" topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand, becoming the group's most commercially successful album to date. It spawned four singles: \"Risingson\", \"Teardrop\", \"Angel\", and \"Inertia Creeps\".\n\nThe production of \"Mezzanine\" was a stressful process. With tensions arising within the group, it almost split the band. They disagreed about the musical direction for the new material. Robert Del Naja first started making samples from new wave records, from the likes of Wire and Gang of Four: it was the music he'd listened to in his early teens. Del Naja wanted Massive Attack to make an album having an atmosphere of edginess and paranoia present in the music of the late 1970s. Grant Marshall, also a new wave fan himself, supported this idea, as he wanted to get away from the \"urban soul\" of their previous work, \"Protection\", but Andrew Vowles was sceptical. The sessions continued with Vowles and Marshall working on bass and drum loops, while Del Naja carried on experimenting from new wave records. However, during the recording, the group decided to release a new track, \"Superpredators\" sampling extensively a Siouxsie and the Banshees' song called \"Metal Postcard\", for the movie soundtrack of \"The Jackal\"; the track would be included on the Japanese version of \"Mezzanine\".\n\nThe album was initially meant to be released in December 1997, but was delayed by four months, with Del Naja spending most of the time in the studio \"making tracks, tearing them apart, them up, panicking, then starting again.\" The album's working title was \"Damaged Goods\", which was the name of the Gang of Four's 1978 debut single.\n\"Mezzanine\" has been described as featuring trip hop and electronica, with a \"dark claustrophobia\" coupled with a melancholy. Musically, the album is a major departure from the jazzy and laidback sound of the first two albums, \"Blue Lines\" and \"Protection\", invoking the dark undercurrents which had always been present in the collective's music. The album's textured and deep tone relies heavily on abstract and ambient sounds, as demonstrated in the song \"Angel\" among others.\n\nSimilar to their previous albums, several songs use one or more samples, ranging from Isaac Hayes to The Cure. In 1998, Manfred Mann sued Massive Attack for unauthorised use of a sample of the song \"Tribute\" from Manfred Mann's Earth Band's eponymous 1972 album, used on \"Black Milk\". The song has subsequently appeared as \"Black Melt\" on later releases and at live performances, with the sample removed. Later digital editions of \"Mezzanine\" have retained the original song, with Mann being added to the songwriting credits.\n\n\"Mezzanine\" marked the parting of band member Vowles, due to creative conflicts. Reggae artist Horace Andy also performed several spots on the album.\n\n\"Mezzanine\" entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 4 September 1998 and then double platinum on 22 July 2013. However, it failed to share the same success in North America, peaking at number 60 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number 51 on the Canadian Albums Chart.\n\nThe album received significant critical acclaim, which praised the collective's new sound. \"Rolling Stone\"s Barney Hoskyns, although praising the album, pointed to its flaws: \"Sometimes rhythm and texture are explored at the expense of memorable tunes, and the absence of the bizarre Tricky [...] only highlights the flat, monotonous rapping of the group's 3-D.\" Robert Christgau of \"The Village Voice\" gave the album a two-star honorable mention rating and selected \"Risingson\" and \"Man Next Door\" as highlights.\n\nJohn Bush of AllMusic also had positive words for the album's song \"Inertia Creeps\", saying it \"could well be the highlight, another feature for just the core threesome. With eerie atmospherics, fuzz-tone guitars, and a wealth of effects, the song could well be the best production from the best team of producers the electronic world had ever seen.\"\n\nYears after the album was released, it was placed on several best-of lists in the UK and the United States. In 2000, \"Q\" magazine placed \"Mezzanine\" at number 15 on its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2003, the album was ranked number 412 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2013, it was placed at 215 on \"NME\"s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nAs of 2010, sales in the United States have exceeded 560,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. An instrumental cover version of the song \"Dissolved Girl\" was written by composer Ramin Djawadi for Westworld season 3, who previously worked with Neil Davidge for Clash of the Titans 2010 film soundtrack. \n\nOn the 20th anniversary of \"Mezzanine\"'s release, the record was encoded into synthetic DNA—a first for an album. The project was in collaboration with TurboBeads Labs in Switzerland; the digital audio of the album was stored in the form of genetic information. The audio was then compressed using Opus, coded in DNA molecules—with 920,000 short DNA strands containing all the data—and then poured into 5,000 tiny glass beads.\n\nThe album was remastered and reissued for its 20th anniversary. The 2CD anniversary edition was released on 23 August 2019, and comes with a bonus disc of previously unreleased dub mixes by the Mad Professor, which were originally intended to be released on a \"Mezzanine\" remix album. A triple-LP vinyl version was also slated to be released; initially delayed from its proposed release date, the 3LP version was eventually canceled altogether.\n\nIn lieu of the vinyl reissue, the Mad Professor remixes were released as a pink-coloured 12\" vinyl single entitled \"Massive Attack v Mad Professor Part II (Mezzanine Remix Tapes '98)\" on 20 September 2019.\n\nThe Mad Professor remixes include \"Metal Banshee\" (an unreleased dub version of \"Superpredators\", which was a reworked cover of \"Metal Postcard\" originally by Siouxsie and the Banshees), and \"Wire\", a track recorded for the soundtrack to the film \"Welcome to Sarajevo\".\n\nSample credits\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Mezzanine\".\n\nMassive Attack\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n"}

It teaches grades 9 through 12. It is a part of the Toronto District School Board (TDSB). Prior to Amalgamation of Toronto in 1998, it was within the Toronto Board of Education (TBE). The closest TTC subway station is Eglinton.\n\nNorthern has long-standing rivalries with nearby high-school North Toronto Collegiate Institute and also with Central Technical School, Lawrence Park Collegiate Institute, York Mills Collegiate Institute and Leaside High School.\n\nFounded in 1930, it was originally known as Northern Vocational School, until the twenty-fifth anniversary when the name was changed to Northern Technical-Commercial, which lasted for three years until the present name, Northern Secondary School, came into use because a definite district had been assigned for matriculation students.\n\nNorthern was the first Ontario school to have a student council. The school is a pilot site of a Toronto Police Service program that places on-duty police officers in schools.\n\nOn May 13, 2016 Northern received a security threat. It was alleged to be a bomb threat and was investigated by the Toronto Police Service.\n\nNorthern Secondary is built in the Collegiate Gothic style, has a floor space of about 121,317 square feet and contains one hundred and fifteen rooms. C.E.C. Dyson was the school's original architect. Although little is known about him, he was the school board's architect from 1921 until 1949. Northern is known for the grotesques which exist on the exterior, throughout the entrance foyer and inside the auditorium.\n\nFurther evidence of the Gothic Collegiate style can be found in the vaulted ceilings of the hallways, and the arched doorways and windows featured throughout the building. As stated on a plaque inside the main entrance, during the 60s a major addition was built which significantly altered the rear of the school. These renovations changed little about the original parts of the building. Although once grand, over the decades, the facility has fallen into considerable disrepair and is in need of extensive renovation.\n\nNorthern's gifted program / enriched program and its comprehensive range of elective courses, including a diverse art department, bring students in from across the city. The school runs a selective admissions process, as well as optional attendance lotteries. There is a large variety of gifted courses available at all grade levels and AP courses available at the grade 11 and 12 levels.\n\nEach year, Northern's students obtain over $1 million in university scholarships.\n\nNorthern's students have won numerous national & international awards in multiple academic disciplines. These include the NASA space settlement competition, the World Debates at Oxford, England, and the Canadian Association of Physicists national contest. Northern debaters are also the current reigning OSDU provincial debate championships.\n\nThe school has over 50 active clubs, associations and committees, as well as over 120 teachers, resulting in a 15 to 1 student teacher ratio.\n\nThe school has over 50 varsity athletic teams. Northern's football team, the Red Knights, have won numerous titles in Toronto's high school league (including two Metro Bowls, and the first Toronto Bowl). A number of top players have gone on to join the Canadian Football League.\n\nNumerous alumni of the school have also gone on to play in the National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, the Israeli Premier League, as well as the Rugby World Cup.\n\nThe school has been used as a location for several films including \"Carrie (2013 film)\", as well as Jarvis Collegiate Institute, and \"\", which were filmed inside the school. The academic decathlon scene of \"Billy Madison\" was filmed in the school's auditorium. The 2009 documentary Fight for the Planet was also filmed at the school.\n\nNumerous commercials have also been filmed on the school's premises.\n\nNorthern has a long history of supporting national & international charities, with over 40 years of participation in the United Way fundraisers for poverty alleviation. The school has been the top fundraiser amongst Toronto high schools for a number of years.\n\nAlumni of the school include one Academy Award winner, a member of the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, holders of the Order of Canada, as well as Grey Cup & Stanley Cup champions, and a Spitfire pilot who played a key role in World War II's Stalag Luft III escape, better known as \"The Great Escape.\"\n\nPainter Lawren P.

The book is set in India during a period of intense urban development and is the chronicle of the marriage between Rukmani, youngest daughter of a village headman, and Nathan, a tenant farmer. The story is told in the first person by Rukmani, beginning from her arranged marriage to Nathan at the age of 12 to his death many years later.\n\nThe title of the novel is taken from the 1825 poem \"\", by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. An excerpt from the poem is the epigraph of the novel:\n\nIn the novel, Rukmani comments, \"Change I had known before, and it had been gradual. But the change that now came into my life, into all our lives, blasting its way into our village, seemed wrought in the twinkling of an eye.\"\n\nRukmani and Nathan love each other and their marriage begins in relative peace and plenty. When a large tannery is built in the neighboring village, it begins insidiously destroying their lives. As the tannery grows larger and more prosperous, Rukmani and Nathan struggle to feed their children and to pay the rent on the land that gives them life. Although matters continue to worsen, they quietly resign themselves to ever-increasing hardships—flood, famine, even death—and cling to their hopes for a better future.\n\nDr. Kennington, or \"Kenny\", an itinerant English doctor, is an important presence in the novel. Although Rukmani's fatalistic attitude toward hardship exasperates him, he feels compassion for her and helps her when he can. At the end, Rukmani goes to live with her youngest son, now a doctor at the hospital Kenny has built.\n\nThroughout the novel, Rukmani is faced with struggle after struggle with no indication that her circumstances will improve. Each time her situation worsens, she endures quietly, holding on to the hope that things will soon be better.\n\nRukmani, an old woman, reflects on her life. The educated daughter of a village headman fallen on hard times, she is married at the age of 12 to Nathan, a tenant farmer. Nathan treats her with kindness and respect as she learns the chores her new life requires. Within a year they have a beautiful daughter, Ira, and good rice harvests. During the next six years, Rukmani does not conceive. Troubled that she cannot produce a son for Nathan, Rukmani visits her ill mother and there meets Kenny, a foreign doctor. He treats her infertility without Nathan's knowledge. In quick succession, Rukmani bears five sons. With each birth, however, the family has a little less to eat. When a tannery is built nearby, unpleasant changes come to village life. Rukmani's two oldest sons eventually work there. They help the family a great deal with their wages but are eventually dismissed for being ringleaders in a labor strike.\n\nThe year they arrange a good marriage for Ira, monsoon rains destroy their crops. Rukmani sacrifices her savings to buy food for the family. Ira's husband returns Ira to her parents’ home because she is barren. Again Rukmani turns to Kenny without her husband's knowledge, this time to help Ira conceive. His treatments are too late, however, since Ira's husband has taken another woman. Rukmani becomes pregnant again and bears her last son, Kuti. Caring for Kuti lifts Ira out of her depression and despair until the crops fail from drought and the family once again goes hungry. They sell most of their possessions just to pay half of what they owe the landowner for their lease. Reduced to foraging for roots and leaves, the family begins to weaken and starve. Kenny secures a servant's position in the city for Rukmani's third son. Rukmani's fourth son is killed stealing a calfskin from the tannery. Kuti suffers the most from hunger, and Ira prostitutes herself to feed him. Despite her efforts, he dies. A good rice harvest arrives too late to save Rukmani's sons.\n\nKenny returns from one of his long absences with money raised to build a hospital in the village. He offers to train Rukmani's remaining son, Selvam, as his assistant. Some villagers speculate that Kenny is kind to Rukmani because they have an illicit relationship. Kunthi, a neighborhood wife who became a prostitute, spreads this rumor out of spite. When they were both young, Nathan fathered Kunthi's two sons. Kunthi uses this as leverage over them until Rukmani learns the truth and forgives Nathan. Now, as Nathan nears fifty, he has no sons left to work the land. He suffers from rheumatism and debilitating fevers. Rukmani and Ira try to help, but they are not strong enough. Ira has a baby to care for, an albino boy conceived in prostitution but loved nonetheless. The family experiences its greatest loss when the land agent tells Nathan and Rukmani their land has been sold to the despised tannery. No one else will lease land to a man as old and ill as Nathan, and Rukmani and Nathan must leave their home of 30 years to live with to their son Murugan in the city. They leave Ira and their grandchild under Selvam's care.\n\nTheir possessions reduced to the few bundles they carry, Nathan and Rukmani try to find Murugan in the city. They rest one night at a temple, where thieves steal their bundles and money. A leprous street urchin named Puli helps them find the home of Kenny's doctor friend. They learn that Murugan has not worked there for the past two years and that he left the position for better wages at the Collector's house. At the Collector's, Murugan's wife informs them that Murugan has deserted her. Her older boy, their grandson, is thin with hunger. Her starving baby is too little to be Murugan's son. Rukmani sees that she and Nathan cannot impose upon their daughter-in-law. They return to the temple, where food is distributed each night to the destitute.\n\nRukmani and Nathan dream of home but have no means to make the trip. Rukmani tries to get work as a letter reader but earns only enough to buy rice cakes. Puli takes them to a stone quarry where there is better-paying work. He helps them learn to break stones, and they come to rely on him. They entrust him with their earnings, and, as they save, they begin to hope. One evening, Rukmani splurges on extra food and toys for Puli and her grandson. When she returns to Nathan at the temple, she expects him to be angry, but instead he is violently ill. During a week of monsoon rains, Nathan continues to work in the quarry despite his fevers and chills. One evening, after she gets paid, Rukmani begins to plan for a cart to take them home. Hurrying to catch up with Nathan, she finds him collapsed in the mud in the street. Kind strangers help carry him to the temple, where he dies in her arms after reminding her of their happiness together. After his death, Rukmani rashly promises Puli his health if he returns to the country with her, a promise Kenny and Selvam will help her keep. She introduces Puli to Selvam and Ira as the son she and Nathan adopted while they were away. Demonstrating hope and compassion, Ira hastens to prepare a meal for Puli, and Selvam promises his mother they will manage.\n"}

She is the younger sister of Lois Lane, and one of several characters who has assumed the Superwoman identity. Maureen Teefy portrayed her in the 1984 movie \"Supergirl\", Peyton List in the television series \"Smallville\" and Jenna Dewan in the series \"Supergirl\".\n\nLucy Lane was created by Otto Binder and Curt Swan. She was introduced in \"Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen\" #36 (April 1959). She is the daughter of Ella and Sam Lane, and the younger sister of Lois Lane.\n\nIn the Silver Age stories, Lucy was presented as an airline stewardess who was an on-again, off-again romantic interest of Jimmy Olsen. Lucy's Silver Age appearances often revolved around Jimmy's various attempts at romancing her. A wedding took place in \"Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen\" issue #100 (March 1967) which was intended to be a permanent change to the comic's status quo, but editor Mort Weisinger changed his mind at the last minute, and had writer Leo Dorfman change the ending to include a sudden annulment of the marriage.\n\nThe character was believed to have died in \"Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane\" #120 (March 1972) but was later revived in a story in \"Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen\" #160 (October 1973).\n\nLucy was reintroduced into DC Comics' continuity in \"The Man of Steel\" #5 (December 1986). Lucy was an air traffic controller, but became affected by a mysterious blindness (implied to have poisoned by Lex Luthor) that was cured as a side-effect of the destruction of a Bizarro clone. Lucy returned to her job and had a brief relationship with Jimmy Olsen. After many encounters with super-villains such as Sleez, Deathstroke, and even becoming a vampire bride, she eventually started dating African-American \"Daily Planet\" staff member Ron Troupe. When Lucy became pregnant, her conservative father was enraged although Lucy explained \"There's not a racist bone in Daddy's body. He hates \"all\" his daughters' beaus.\" Sam Lane eventually overcame his anger when Lucy and Ron were married and their child was born.\n\nAfter a long disappearance from the principal storylines, Lucy Lane returns in the one shot \"Superman: New Krypton\". Her past with Ron Troupe is unclear, they are possibly estranged (Troupe having resurfaced in the current storylines, working again with the Daily Planet). Her long disappearance is explained by her joining the military, in a desperate, post-mortem attempt to appease her (presumed) dead father's desire to have a son able to carry on his career in the military. Bitter and angrier than in her former appearances, she still blames Lois for General Sam Lane's apparent death during the war against Imperiex. Essentially, she thinks Lois broke his heart by putting her love for Superman before her duties as a daughter.\n\nLucy references her former appearances, even mentioning her \"dating boys in Lois' circle\" as failed attempts to live her life through her more successful sister, but she eventually chooses to sacrifice her life and live the military career her father intended for Lois, driving an even deeper wedge between the two sisters. Unbeknownst to her, their father is still alive, and working with the government.\n\nLucy first appeared as Superwoman in \"Supergirl\" #35, her costume a nod to that of the Bronze Age Superwoman Kristin Wells and containing a containment field that simulated Kryptonian powers. Lucy's identity was not revealed until near the story arc's end. During her tenure as Superwoman, she was ordered by her father, General Sam Lane, to kill Agent Liberty, who had been spying on General Lane and Lex Luthor. She later attacked Reactron, which tipped off readers that Superwoman was not Kryptonian (in that the villain's Gold Kryptonite power source had no effect on her). Supergirl unmasks Superwoman, and accidentally kills her by rupturing the containment field of her suit, causing Lucy's body to contort and explode.\n\nIn \"Supergirl Annual\" #1 readers are given the current modern backstory of Lucy Lane. In the story, Lucy, since the moment she was born, has felt overshadowed by her big sister Lois. Lucy always felt that Lois outperformed her, overshadowed her and was more loved by their father. Lucy never blames Lois but she blames her parents Sam and Ella. Feeling that by maybe being closer to Lois her father would pay more attention to her, Lucy moved to the same city but this came at the same time Lois and her father grew apart over Superman. After her father's death, Lucy joined the army. Being a great soldier and a woman, Lucy rose quickly in the ranks. During the Amazon attack on the United States, Lucy was nearly killed by two Amazons but was saved by . Awaking in Project 7734, her father is able to convince Lucy to put on the Superwoman suit, which possessed mystical qualities.\n\nAlthough seemingly dead, Lucy's remains steal the lifeforce of a man who came too close. When Lucy is recovered by General Lane's forces, they learn that the suit's mystic energies have somehow transformed her into an actual Kryptonian.\n\nFollowing the \"\" storyline, Lucy is in custody in S.T.A.R. Labs by Kimiyo Hoshi and Gangbuster, who are attempting to remove Lucy's metahuman abilities. After interference by an object that crashes into a Metropolis park, before they leave Lucy's holding cell, it is shown seemingly to have lightly cracked. Later, Lucy is visited by her sister Lois, who wants to talk. Lucy is unhelpful as she has completely given in to insanity. Lois tells Lucy that she is disgusted by her and walks away leaving Lucy in S.T.A.R. Labs custody behind. Although the crack in the cell seemed to hint at Lucy escaping at some point, nothing came of it, and once The New 52 was launched, all storylines in progress in DC were dropped in favor of the new continuity.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Lucy Lane is first seen where she was picked up from the train station by Lois after Clark Kent was unable to fulfill his promise to Lois to do it himself. Later to make up for it, Clark accompanies her, Lois, Johnathan Carrol, and Morgan Edge to the most expensive restaurant in town but is later forced to leave her with the check due to his duties as Superman. Clark later makes it up to her by taking her bungee jumping, an activity which Lucy enjoys. Lucy befriended and later became roommates with Olivia after they met while white water rafting. They also adopted a cat named Simon. Olivia became ill and Doctor Obeshian gave her drugs to take, the drugs having secretly been taken from an alien fungus which would mutate the user into a shapeshifting creature. Lucy and Olivia both took the pills resulting in the former turning into a wolf like creature and the latter into a giant insect-like creature. An organization named the Cartel began kidnapping users of the drug, which had begun circulating on the streets, for detox and they managed to capture Olivia. Lucy convinced Lois to save Olivia. In her insect form Lucy rescued Lois and Olivia from the Cartel's base. The issue ended with Lois comforting a hysterical Lucy.\n\nAlthough Superwoman originally had no inherent powers, her powersuit altered her DNA via a containment field to resemble that of a Kryptonian and as such would potentially make her capable of all the same feats they possess under the yellow sun.\nThe abilities she has used thus far are; vast superhuman strength, speed and durability, invulnerability, flight (normal and interstellar), freeze breath and heat vision. The powersuit protects her from the harmful effects of Kryptonite and grants her the ability to steal the life of someone nearby to resurrect herself.\nAny other non-Kryptonian abilities the suit may possess have yet to be revealed. Due to the launch of the New 52, it is unlikely that any of the suit's other powers will be revealed unless it makes an appearance in the new continuity.\n\nAs a result of her resurrection in \"Supergirl\" #50, she is said to have all the inherent abilities and weaknesses of \"Those alien races\" which were duplicated by the suit as the result of her return from the dead. While the exact number of alien races whose powers are duplicated by the suit are unknown, Kryptonian powers are among the powerset, as she displayed the ability to use Heat Vision shortly after her recovery by Sam Lane's forces when she was reborn. She confirms that she possesses super hearing when she murders a scientist working for Lane, though she does so with some form of energy blast from her hand, a power that is not among the abilities of a Kryptonian. If this statement is accurate, Lucy Lane now shares the inherent weakness to Kryptonite which all Kryptonians possess.\n\nThe original suit was destroyed by Supergirl but she appears to have acquired another as of \"Supergirl\" #50, and it is unknown if this suit is the same as the one she had been using to masquerade as a Kryptonian, or a non-magical one.\n\nAfter her mutation due to drugs created from an alien fungus Lucy can transform from her mutated form to her normal form. In her mutated form Lucy can fly and apparently withstand tranquilizer darts.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released 30 March 2005, sold out, and quickly went to a second printing. When this comic was first published, the cover showed Batman holding a shadowed corpse, so as not to ruin the surprise of who dies. For the second printing, the shadows were removed to reveal the identity of the corpse. During initial solicitations the comic was entitled \"DC Countdown\" to postpone revelation of an upcoming crisis.\n\n\"Countdown\" was a special 80 page comic originally priced at $1, much lower than would normally be the case for an 80-page comic, although the second printing was priced at $2. The script was co-written by Geoff Johns, Greg Rucka, and Judd Winick, while the art chores were divided up, generally on a chapter by chapter basis, between the penciller-inker teams of Rags Morales & Michael Bair, Jesus Saiz & Jimmy Palmiotti, Ivan Reis & Marc Campos, and Phil Jimenez & Andy Lanning. Artist Ed Benes pencilled and inked his chapter.\n\nThe main plot concerns Ted Kord, the superhero and former Justice League member known as the Blue Beetle, investigating the theft of funds from his company that has left him nearly bankrupt. Most of the other DC heroes except Wonder Woman dismiss Kord's concerns, either politely or, like Batman, outright. Only Booster Gold, another superhero and Kord's best friend, eventually decides to help complete the investigation, but before he can he is seriously injured by an explosive trap. \nAlone and unaided, Blue Beetle continues to follow the clues to Switzerland where he infiltrates the castle base of the Checkmate organization. There, he confronts Maxwell Lord, who is revealed to be using his Justice League files and Batman's satellite, the Brother MK I, to keep an eye on the superhero community, which he considers a threat to the human race. After Beetle refuses to join Lord, Lord executes him with a fatal gunshot to the head.\n\n\"Countdown\" was bannered as a bridge to all four of the Crisis leadup titles, but featured each of them unevenly. The main plot was essentially an extended prologue to \"The OMAC Project\". The events of \"Day of Vengeance\" were foreshadowed, when the Beetle confronted the wizard Shazam, but no particular hints about that title were made. The \"Rann-Thanagar War\" was mentioned on a single page, but seemed to already be underway in the story.

Freedman had two caps for the Scottish national football team where he scored one goal in a 2002 World Cup qualifier against Latvia.\n\nFreedman started his managerial career with Crystal Palace in 2011. He moved to fellow Championship club Bolton Wanderers in 2012, but left this position in October 2014. He became manager of Nottingham Forest in February 2015, with whom he parted company in March 2016.\n\nFreedman began his career with top flight Queens Park Rangers in 1992, but never made their first team. He moved to Third Division Barnet on a free transfer in July 1994, aged 20. He made his league debut in August 1994 and quickly became the club's leading player as he struck 24 goals in his debut season. A bright start to the following season attracted the interest of Crystal Palace. Despite only spending a short spell at Barnet at the beginning of his playing career, Freedman was voted as the fans' favourite player in the club's all-time history in late 2007.\n\nFreedman was signed by Crystal Palace for a fee of £800,000 in September 1995. He instantly showed he could continue his goalscoring form at the higher level when he netted 20 times in the 1995–96 season. This haul included an 11-minute hat-trick against Grimsby Town on 5 March 1996.\n\nThe following, 1996–97 season saw a less prolific 11 league goals but helped the club to the promotion play-offs. He then scored crucial goals in the 89th and 90th minutes of their Play Off semi-final tie with Wolves after coming off the bench with 17 minutes left. Palace went on to win promotion in the Wembley Play Off final, beating Sheffield United 1–0. Freedman's experience of Premier League football in the 1997–98 season proved short-lived though as he only managed seven top flight games before being sold to Wolves.\n\nFreedman joined Wolves, initially on loan, in October 1997. After impressing with two goals in as many games, Wolves quickly made his contract permanent in a £800,000 combined deal with Palace defender Kevin Muscat. However, Freedman's time at Wolves only lasted until the end of the 1997–98 season. He was the team's top goalscorer with 13 in total in a season that saw Wolves fail to mount a serious promotion challenge. The emergence of striker Robbie Keane during the season helped convince Wolves to sell Freedman.\n\nIn August 1998 Freedman signed for newly promoted Premier League side Nottingham Forest for a fee of £900,000. He made his first appearance for Forest on 17 August 1998 as a substitute in a 2–1 defeat at Arsenal. In his first full campaign in the top flight in 1998–99 he scored 9 league goals for Forest who were relegated that season to Division One. In his second season at Forest in 1999–2000, the club languished in mid-table under manager David Platt. Freedman made a total of 81 appearances, and scoring 23 goals, before being sold to Crystal Palace in October 2000.\n\nFreedman rejoined Palace in October 2000 for a transfer fee of £600,000. He rejoined the club during a relegation threatened campaign, but one which ended with perhaps his most famous goal for the club. Relegation to the third tier loomed in their final game of the season at Stockport County, with three minutes left and no score. Freedman then scored the vital goal that kept Palace in the division and relegated Huddersfield Town.\n\nThe following season saw Freedman bag 21 goals in all competitions, his best seasonal tally for Palace. This also earned him a call-up to the Scottish national team, to add to his earlier Under 21 caps. However, the next season was less of a personal success as he was dropped from the Scotland side, and began to find his appearances limited at Palace, as manager Trevor Francis largely preferred Ade Akinbiyi, Dele Adebola, and Andy Johnson to him.\n\nHis fortunes were revived in 2003–04 though, as he re-established himself as a first choice regular under new manager Iain Dowie. A strong surge in the second half of the season saw the club go from relegation contenders to the promotion play-offs. Freedman scored during the penalty shootout victory at Sunderland in the semi-finals to help the club to the final. He was an unused substitute in the final though, which saw the club beat West Ham, the second time he had been promoted with the club.\n\nHowever, life in the Premier League in 2004–05 saw Freedman often overlooked as the team employed only one striker in most games, with Andy Johnson being the preferred choice in this role. Despite attracting interest from Leeds United midway through the season, he remained committed to the Palace cause of consolidating Premier League status by rejecting a loan bid from the Championship contenders. He stayed to score his only top flight goal for the club in their vital final fixture at Charlton Athletic, drawing them level at 1–1. However, the eventual 2–2 result saw the club endure a record fourth Premier League relegation.\n\nBack in the Championship, he remained down the pecking order behind England international Andy Johnson and Republic of Ireland international Clinton Morrison. However, injuries to Johnson and Jon Macken, and lack of form from Morrison brought him back into the team and he scored his 100th and 101st goals for Crystal Palace in a 3–2 win at rivals Brighton & Hove Albion on 20 November 2005. This made him only the seventh player in Palace history to have reached the century mark.\n\nHe managed to stay in the line-up after Johnson's return, having made a great impression on Palace boss Iain Dowie, who, later, made a public call to Scotland boss Walter Smith for the striker to be given another chance in the national side. He ended the season with six league goals, as the club comfortably reached the play-offs. However, they were beaten by Watford in their semi final tie to deny him a chance of a third promotion.\n\nThe appointment of Peter Taylor as manager in Summer 2006 limited Freedman's chances, and he could only manage three league goals. However, he extended his contract by a further two years at the conclusion of the season. Taylor was replaced by Neil Warnock early in the 2007–08 season, but strong goalscoring form of Clinton Morrison limited Freedman to rare substitute appearances.\n\nWith Morrison keeping him out of the Palace side, Freedman, after initially rejecting the move (as he had done during the 2004–05 season), decided to move to League One club Leeds United on loan until the end of the season.\n\nHe was in excellent form for the Elland Road club, scoring five goals to ensure a play-off place including a brace against Carlisle United in a 3–2 win at Elland Road and also receiving praise from Leeds manager Gary McAllister. This form earned him League One's \"\"Player of the Month\"\" award for April, while another vital late play-off goal in the first leg of Leeds' semi-final tie with Carlisle United and an assist for a last minute Jonny Howson goal in the second leg helped the Whites to Wembley, where he featured in the play-off final on the day of his 34th birthday, as Leeds were downed 1–0 by Doncaster Rovers. After the season ended, Freedman revealed that he wanted to join Leeds permanently, however Leeds signed Luciano Becchio and Freedman had to look elsewhere.\n\nFreedman is still held in very high regard by the Leeds United's supporters to this day despite such a short spell at the club, his impact in helping the team to the playoff final and his impressive interviews during his time at Leeds means he will always be remembered as a cult hero.\n\nAfter returning to Palace at the end of the season, Freedman was granted a testimonial match to reward him for 10 years' service at the club over two spells, with the match to be a first-team pre-season friendly fixture against Fulham at Selhurst Park which ended in a 0–0 draw. Following this match, Warnock allowed Freedman to depart Selhurst. He was heavily linked with a permanent move to Leeds, however this never materialised.\n\nInstead Freedman moved to Southend United on a free transfer, scoring four goals in his first four outings for the Shrimpers. However his first season was plagued by injury. The following season saw the form of Lee Barnard keep Freedman out of the side.\n\nIn March 2010, Freedman had his contract at Southend terminated by mutual consent to rejoin Palace as part of the coaching staff, signalling the end of his playing career.\n\nFreedman played for the Scotland under-21 team in the mid-1990s. Scotland manager Craig Brown considered selecting Freedman for the full national side in 1996, when main striker Kevin Gallacher was injured. Freedman made his Scotland debut on 6 October 2001, in a 2002 World Cup qualifying match against Latvia at Hampden Park. The Scots won the match 2–1, with Freedman scoring the equalising goal. It was scored by a header past then Crystal Palace teammate, goalkeeper Aleksandrs Koliņko, and came after another Palace teammate, Andrejs Rubins, had given Latvia a 1–0 lead. Despite this victory, Scotland failed to gain a place in the World Cup. Craig Brown resigned after the match and was replaced as Scotland manager by Berti Vogts. Freedman only earned one more Scotland cap following Vogts' appointment, playing the first 45 minutes of a 5–0 defeat by France in a March 2002 friendly.\n\nFreedman's coaching career began when he was appointed as the reserve team manager of Crystal Palace in November 2005. He was in this role alongside his playing duties for the club's first team. This role ended when he joined Leeds United on loan the following March. Following his move to Southend United, he began coaching alongside playing for the Shrimpers' first team.\n\nIn March 2010, Freedman returned to Crystal Palace again, this time as assistant manager to Paul Hart, with John Pemberton as first team coach, helping secure survival for the Eagles. When George Burley was appointed as manager, he kept Freedman as assistant manager. Following the sacking of Burley on New Year's Day 2011, Freedman was given the role as manager, originally on a caretaker basis, which many expected to be for a few weeks until a new manager was appointed. However, Freedman was made permanent manager of Crystal Palace signing a two and a half-year deal on 11 January 2011. He quickly moved to bring in Lennie Lawrence as his assistant manager and former Palace teammate Tony Popovic as first team coach.\n\nHe was ultimately successful in guiding Crystal Palace out of the relegation zone, with the club achieving safety with a game to spare. Palace began the 2011–12 season well under their new manager, occupying the playoff places at the end of October and also enjoying a good run in the Football League Cup, where they knocked out Manchester United 2–1 at Old Trafford with goals from Darren Ambrose and Glenn Murray. Crystal Palace ended the season in 17th place. They made a strong start to the 2012–13 season.\n\nOn 23 October 2012 Crystal Palace released a statement announcing \"that first team manager Dougie Freedman has joined Bolton Wanderers.\" At the time Bolton, in 16th place in the Championship, were 12 places below Crystal Palace in 4th. Bolton confirmed the appointment on 25 October. His first match in charge of Bolton finished in a 2–1 win over Cardiff City. His first signing as Bolton manager was that of Norwich City midfielder Jacob Butterfield on a month-long loan.\n\nThroughout November, Freedman's first full month in charge, his new team remained undefeated, the first time they had achieved this for two years. He went on to lead Bolton Wanderers to five wins in a row for the first time since 2006 in the late push for promotion, taking the club from 20th to 7th position in the Championship. Bolton narrowly missed out on qualifying for the play-offs on the final day of the season, whereas Crystal Palace made it into the play-offs and ultimately ended up winning the play offs and being promoted. After guiding Bolton to a late push for the play-offs, Freedman won the Football League Championship Manager of the Month award for April 2013. The 2013–14 season was less successful as Bolton were inconsistent and finished in 14th, their first win not coming until October.\n\nThe 2014–15 season started similarly, Bolton failed to win any of their first 6 games and only one of the first ten. Freedman left the club on 3 October 2014 by mutual consent.\n\nOn 1 February 2015, Freedman was appointed as manager of Nottingham Forest, following the sacking of Stuart Pearce. After a positive start to his tenure, on 16 April 2015 it was confirmed that Freedman had signed a new contract to keep him at the City Ground for a further two years. Forest finished 14th for the 2014–15 season. Following only three wins in 22 games, Freedman's position at Forest came under threat, with former Forest player Nigel Clough being linked to replacing Freedman as manager. However, following wins against Reading, Fulham and MK Dons, plus away draws against Wolves and Blackburn in November and December 2015, Freedman's position stabilised, even more so when Clough was appointed manager of Burton Albion in December. In spite of having a number of key players injured and Forest being severely restricted because of a transfer embargo, Freedman went on to lead Forest to a 13-game unbeaten run. This ended on 30 January 2016 with a 1–0 defeat to Watford in the fourth round of the FA cup. However, shortly after, Forest lost form, managing only one win in six games. Following a 3–0 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday at the City Ground on 12 March 2016, in which eight Forest players were unable to play because of injury, Freedman was sacked the following day.\n\nOn 21 August 2017, Freedman returned to Crystal Palace as sporting director.\n\nCrystal Palace\n\n\nIndividual\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1791712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791712", "title": "Normality (behavior)", "text": "Normality (behavior)\n\nNormality is a behavior that can be normal for an individual (intrapersonal normality) when it is consistent with the most common behaviour for that person. Normal is also used to describe individual behaviour that conforms to the most common behaviour in society (known as conformity). Definitions of normality vary by person, time, place, and situation – it changes along with changing societal standards and norms. Normal behavior is often only recognized in contrast to abnormality. In its simplest form, normality is seen as good while abnormality is seen as bad. Someone being seen as normal or not normal can have social ramifications, such as being included, excluded or stigmatized by larger society.\n\nNormality has been functionally and differentially defined by a vast number of disciplines, so there is not one single definition.\n\nIn general, 'normal' refers to a lack of significant deviation from the average. The word normal is used in a more narrow sense in mathematics, where a normal distribution describes a population whose characteristics centers around the average or the norm. When looking at a specific behaviour, such as the frequency of lying, a researcher may use a Gaussian bell curve to plot all reactions, and a normal reaction would be within one standard deviation, or the most average 68.3%. However, this mathematical model only holds for one particular trait at a time, since, for example, the probability of a single individual being within one standard deviation for 36 independent variables would be one in a million. In statistics, normal is often arbitrarily considered anything that falls within about 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, or the most average 95% (see 1.96). The probability of an individual being within 1.96 standard deviations for 269 independent variables is approximately one in a million. For only 59 independent variables, the probability is just under 5%. Under this definition of normal, it is abnormal to be normal for 59 independent variables.\n\nThe French sociologist Émile Durkheim indicated in his \"Rules of the Sociological Method\" that it was necessary for the sociological method to offer parameters to distinguish normality from pathology or abnormality. He suggested that behaviors or \"social facts\" which are present in the majority of cases are normal, and exceptions to that behavior indicate pathology. Durkheim's model of normality further explained that the most frequent or general behaviors, and thus the most normal behaviors, will persist through transition periods in society. Crime, for instance, exists under every society through every time period, and so should be considered normal. There is a two-fold version of normality; behaviors considered normal on a societal level may still be considered pathological on an individual level. On the individual level, people who violate social norms, such as criminals, will invite a punishment from others in the society.\n\nIndividual’s behaviours are guided by what they perceive to be society's expectations and their peers' norms. People measure the appropriateness of their actions by how far away they are from those social norms. However, what is perceived as the norm may or may not actually be the most common behaviour. In some cases of pluralistic ignorance, most people wrongly believe the social norm is one thing, but in fact very few people hold that view.\n\nWhen people are made more aware of a social norm, particularly a descriptive norm (a norm describing what is done), their behaviour changes to become closer to that norm. The power of these norms can be harnessed by social norms marketing, where the social norm is advertised to people in an attempt to stop extreme behaviour, such as binge drinking. However, people at the other extreme (very little alcohol consumption) are equally likely to change their behaviour to become closer to the norm, in this case by increasing alcohol consumption. Instead of using descriptive norms, more effective social norms marketing may use injunctive norms. Instead of describing what behaviour is most commonly done, an injunctive norm is what is approved or disapproved of by society. When individuals become aware of the injunctive norm, only the extremes will change their behaviour (by decreasing alcohol consumption) without the boomerang effect of under-indulgers increasing their drinking.\n\nThe social norms that guide people are not always normal for everyone. Behaviours that are abnormal for most people may be considered normal for a subgroup or subculture. For example, normal college student behaviour may be to party and drink alcohol, but for a subculture of religious students, normal behaviour may be to go to church and pursue religion related activities. Subcultures may actively reject \"normal\" behaviour, instead replacing society norms with their own.\n\nA disharmony exists between a virtual identity of the self and a real social identity, whether it be in the form of a trait or attribute. If a person does not have this disharmony, then he or she is described as normal. A virtual identity can take many definitions, but in this case a virtual identity is the identity that persons mentally create that conforms to societal standards and norms, it may not represent how they actually are, but it represents what they believe is the typical \"normal\" person. A real social identity is the identity that persons actually have in their society or is perceived, by themselves or others, to have. If these two identities have differences between each other, there is said to be disharmony. Individuals may monitor and adapt their behaviour in terms of others' expected perceptions of the individual, which is described by the social psychology theory of self-presentation. In this sense, normality exists based on societal norms, and whether someone is normal is entirely up to how he or she views him- or herself in contrast to how society views him or her. While trying to define and quantify normality is a good start, all definitions confront the problem of whether we are even describing an idea that even exists since there are so many different ways of viewing the concept.\n\nMany difficulties arise in measuring normal behaviors – biologists come across parallel issues when defining normality. One complication which arises regards whether 'normality' is used correctly in everyday language. People say \"This heart is abnormal\" if only a portion of it is not working correctly, yet it may be inaccurate to include the entirety of the heart under the abnormal description. There can be a difference between the normality of the structure and function of a body part. Similarly, a behavioural pattern may not conform to social norms, but still be effective and non-problematic for that individual. Where there is a dichotomy between appearance and function of a behaviour, it may be difficult to measure its normality. This is applicable when trying to diagnose a pathology and is addressed in the DSM.\n\nWhat is viewed as normal can change dependent on both timeframe and environment. Normality can be viewed as \"an endless process of man's self-creation and his reshaping of the world\". Within this idea, it is possible to surmise that normality is not an all-encompassing term, but simply a relative term based around a current trend in time. With statistics, this is likened to the thought that if the data gathered provides a mean and standard deviation, over time these data that predict \"normalness\" start to predict or dictate it less and less since the social idea of normality is dynamic. This is shown in studies done on behavior in psychology and sociology where behavior in mating rituals or religious rituals can change within a century in humans, showing that the \"normal\" way that these rituals are performed shift and a new procedure becomes the normal one.\n\nAs another example, understandings of what is normal sexual behaviour varies greatly across time and place. In many countries, perceptions on sexuality are largely becoming more liberal, especially views on the normality of masturbation and homosexuality. Social understanding on normal sexual behaviour also varies greatly country by country – countries can be divided into categories of how they approach sexual normality, as conservative, homosexual-permissive, or liberal. The United States, Ireland, and Poland have more conservative social understanding of sexuality among university students, while Scandinavian students consider a wider variety of sexual acts as normal. Although some attempts have been made to define sexual acts as normal, abnormal, or indeterminate, these definitions are time-sensitive. Gayle Rubin's 1980s model of sexual 'normality' was comprehensive at the time but has since become outdated as society has liberalized.\n\nSince normality shifts in time and environment, the mean and standard deviation are only useful for describing normality from the environment from which they are collected.\n\nMost definitions of normality consider interpersonal normality, the comparison between many different individual's behaviours to distinguish normality from abnormality. Intrapersonal normality looks at what is normal behaviour for one particular person (consistency within a person) and would be expected to vary person-to-person. A mathematical model of normality could still be used for intrapersonal normality, by taking a sample of many different occurrences of behaviour from one person over time. Also like interpersonal normality, intrapersonal normality may change over time, due to changes in the individual as they age and due to changes in society (since society's view of normality influences individual peoples' behaviour).\n\nIt is most comfortable for people to engage in behaviour which conforms to their own personal habitual norms. When things go wrong, people are more likely to attribute the negative outcome on any abnormal behaviour leading up to the mishap. After a car crash, people may say \"if only I didn't leave work early\", blaming the crash on their actions which were not normal. This counterfactual thinking particularly associates abnormal behaviour with negative outcomes.\n\nIn medicine, behavioral normality pertains to a patient's mental condition aligning with that of a model, healthy patient. A person without any mental illness is considered a normal patient, whereas a person with a mental disability or illness is viewed as abnormal. These normals and abnormals in the context of mental health subsequently create negative stigmatic perceptions towards individuals with mental illness. The Brain & Behavior Research Foundation stated that \"an estimated 26.2 percent of Americans ages 18 and older – about 1 in 4 adults – suffer from one or more of (several) disorders in a given year\". Though the population of American individuals living with mental illness is not as small of a minority as commonly perceived, it is considered abnormal nonetheless, therefore the subject of discrimination and abuse such as violent therapies, punishments, or labeling for life by the normal, healthy majority. The CDC reported that \"cluster[s] of negative attitudes and beliefs motivate the general public to fear, reject, avoid, and discriminate against people with mental illnesses\". In continuum, the resources available to those who suffer from such illness are limited, and government support is constantly being cut from programs that help individuals living with mental illness live more comfortable, accommodative, happier lives.\n\nHebbian associative learning and memory maintenance depends on synaptic normalization mechanisms to prevent synaptic runaway. Where synaptic runaway describes overcrowding of dendritic associations, which reduce sensory or behavioural acuteness proportional to the level of synaptic runaway. Synaptic/neuronal normalization refers to synaptic competition, where the prosper of one synapse may weakening the efficacy of other nearby surrounding synapses with redundant neurotransmission.\n\nAnimal dendritic density greatly increases throughout waking hours despite intrinsic normalization mechanisms as described as above. The growth rate of synaptic density is not sustained in a cumulative fashion. Without a pruning state, the signal to noise ratio of CNS mechanism would not be able to operate with maximum effectiveness, and learning would be detrimental to animal survival. Neuronal and synaptic normalization mechanisms must operate so positive association feedback loops to not become rampant while constantly processing new environmental information.\n\nSome researchers speculate that the slow oscillation (nREM) cycles of animal sleep constitute an essential 're-normalization' phase. The re-normalization occurs from cortical large amplitude brain rhythm, in the low delta range (0.5–2 Hz), synaptically downscaling the associations from the wakeful learning state. Only the strongest associations survive the pruning from this phase. This allows retention of salient information coding from the previous day, but also allows more cortical space and energy distribution to continue effective learning subsequently after a slow-wave oscillation episode of sleep.\n\nAlso, organisms tend to have a normal biological developmental pathway as a central nervous system ages and/or learns. Deviations for a species' normal development frequently will result in behaviour dysfunction, or death, of that organism.\n\nWhen people do not conform to the normal standard, they are often labelled as sick, disabled, abnormal, or unusual, which can lead to marginalization or stigmatization. Most people want to be normal and strive to be perceived as such, so that they can relate to society at large. Without having things in common with the general population, people may feel isolated among society. The abnormal person feels like they have less in common with the normal population, and others have difficulty relating to things that they have not experienced themselves. Additionally, abnormality may make others uncomfortable, further separating the abnormally labelled individual.\n\nSince being normal is generally considered an ideal, there is often pressure from external sources to conform to normality, as well as pressure from people's intrinsic desire to feel included. For example, families and the medical community will try to help disabled people live a normal life. However, the pressure to appear normal, while actually having some deviation, creates a conflict – sometimes someone will appear normal, while actually experiencing the world differently or struggling. When abnormality makes society feel uncomfortable, it is the exceptional person themselves who will laugh it off to relieve social tension. A disabled person is given normal freedoms, but may not be able to show negative emotions. Lastly, society's rejection of deviance and the pressure to normalize may cause shame in some individuals. Abnormalities may not be included in an individual's sense of identity, especially if they are unwelcome abnormalities.\n\nWhen an individual's abnormality is labelled as a pathology, it is possible for that person to take on both elements of the sick role or the stigmatization that follows some illnesses. Mental illness, in particular, is largely misunderstood by the population and often overwhelms others' impression of the patient.\n\nApplying normality clinically depends on the field and situation a practitioner is in. In the broadest sense, clinical normality is the idea of uniformity of physical and psychological functioning across individuals. Normality, and abnormality, can be characterized statistically.\nRelated to the previous definition, statistically normality is usually defined it in terms of a normal distribution curve, with the so-called 'normal zone' commonly accounting for 95.45% percent of all the data. The remaining 4.55% will lie split outside of two standard deviations from the mean. Thus any variable case that lies outside of two deviations from the mean would be considered abnormal. However, the critical value of such statistical judgments may be subjectively altered to a less conservative estimate. It is in fact normal for a population to have a proportion of abnormals. The presence of abnormals is important because it is necessary to define what 'normal' is, as normality is a relative concept. So at a group, or macro level, of analysis; abnormalities are normal given a demographic survey, but at an individual level abnormal individuals are seen as being deviant in someway that needs to be corrected.\nStatistical normality is important in determining demographic pathologies. When a variable rate, such as virus spread within a human population, exceeds its normal infection rate then preventative or emergency measures can be introduced. \nIt is often impractical to apply statistical normality to diagnose individuals. Symptom normality is the current, and assumed most effective, way to assess patient pathology. Psychiatric normality, in a broad sense, states that psychopathology are disorders that are deviations from normality.\n\nNormality, as a relative concept, is intrinsically involved with contextual elements. As a result, clinical disorder classification has particular challenges in discretely diagnosing 'normal' constitutions from true disorders. The \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM) is the psychiatric profession's official classification manual of mental disorders since its first published version DSM-I in by the APA, 1952. As the DSM evolved into its current version, DSM-5 in late 2013, there have been numerous conflicts in proposed classification between mental illness and normal mentality. Dr. Allen Frances, who chaired the task force for content in the DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR even wrote a scathing indictment of the pressures incumbent on the definition of \"normal\" relative to psychological constructs and mental illness in his book, \"Saving Normal\".\n\nMost of this difficulty stems from the DSM's ambiguity of natural contextual stressor reactions versus individual dysfunction. There are some key progressions along the DSM history that have attempted to integrate some aspects of normality into proper diagnosis classification. As a diagnostic manual for classification of abnormalities, all DSMs have been biased towards classifying symptoms as disorders by emphasizing symptomatic singularity. The result is an encompassing misdiagnosis of possible normal symptoms, appropriate as contextually derived.\n\nThe second edition of the DSM, DSM-II, could not be effectively applied because of its vague descriptive nature. Psychodynamic etiology was a strong theme in classifying mental illnesses. The applied definitions became idiosyncratic, stressing individual unconscious roots. This made applying the DSM unreliable across psychiatrists. No distinction between abnormal to normal was established.\n\nEvidence of the classification ambiguity were punctated by the Rosenhan experiment of 1972. This experiment demonstrated that the methodology of psychiatric diagnosis could not effectively distinguish normal from disordered mentalities. DSM-II labelled 'excessive' behavioral and emotional response as an index of abnormal mental wellness to diagnose some particular disorders. 'Excessiveness' of a reaction implied alternative normal behaviour which would have to include a situational factor in evaluation. As an example; a year of intense grief from the death of a spouse may be a normal appropriate response. To have intense grief for twenty years would be indicative of a mental disorder. As well, to grieve intensely over the loss of a sock would also not be considered normal responsiveness and indicate a mental disorder. The consideration of proportionality to stimuli was a perceived strength in psychiatric diagnosis for the DSM-II.\n\nAnother characteristic of the DSM-II systemization was that it classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. Thus, homosexuality was psychiatrically defined a pathological deviation from 'normal' sexual development. Homosexuality was later replaced in the 7th printing of DSM-II, instead categorized as a 'Sexual orientation disturbance'. The intent was to have a label that applied only to those homosexual individuals who were bothered by their sexual orientation. In this manner homosexuality would not be viewed as an atypical illness. Only if it was distressing would homosexuality be classified as a mental illness. However, the DMS-II did not explicitly state that any homosexuality was normal either. This stigma lasted into DSM-III until it was reformed entirely from DSM classifications in 1987.\n\nDSM-III was a best attempt to credit psychiatry as a scientific discipline, from the opprobrium resulting from DSM-II. A reduction in the psychodynamic etiologies of DSM-II spilled over into a reduction symptom etiology altogether. Thus, DSM-III was a specific set of definitions for mental illnesses, and entities more suited to diagnostic psychiatry, but which annexed response proportionality as a classification factor. The product was that all symptoms, whether normal proportional response or inappropriate pathological tendencies, could both be treated as potential signs of mental illness.\n\nDSM-IV explicitly distinguishes mental disorders and non-disordered conditions. A non-disordered condition results from, and is perpetuated by, social stressors. Included in DSM-IV's classification is that a mental disorder \"must not be merely an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one. Whatever its original cause, it must currently be considered a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual\" (American Psychiatric Association 2000:xxxi)\nThis had supposedly injected normality consideration back into the DSM, from its removal from DSM-II. However, it has been speculated that DSM-IV still does not escape the problems DSM-III faced, where psychiatric diagnoses still include symptoms of expectable responses to stressful circumstances to be signs of disorders, along with symptoms that are individual dysfunctions. The example set by DSM-III, for principally symptom-based disorder classification, has been integrated as the norm of mental diagnostic practice.\n\nThe DSM-5 was released in the second half of 2013. It has significant differences from DSM IV-TR, including the removal of the multi-axial classifications and reconfiguring the Asperger's/autistic spectrum classifications.\n\nSince the advent of DSM-III, the subsequent editions of the DSM have all included a heavy symptom based pathology diagnosis system. Although there have been some attempts to incorporate environmental factors into mental and behavioural diagnostics, many practitioners and scientists believe that the most recent DSM's are misused. The symptom bias makes diagnosing quick and easier allowing for practitioners to increase their clientele because symptoms can be easier to classify and deal with than dealing with life or event histories which have evoked what may be a temporary and normal mental state in reaction to a patients environmental circumstances. \nThe easy-to-use manual not only has increased the perceived need for more mental health care, stimulating funding for mental health care facilities, but also has had a global impact on marketing strategies. Many pharmaceutical commercial ads list symptoms such as fatigue, depression, or anxiety. However, such symptoms are not necessarily abnormal, and are appropriate responses to such occurrences as the loss of a loved one. The targets of such ads in such cases do not need medication and can naturally overcome their grief, but with such an advertising strategy pharmaceutical companies can greatly expand their marketing.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1791718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791718", "title": "Gerhard Lenski", "text": "Gerhard Lenski\n\nGerhard Emmanuel \"Gerry\" Lenski, Jr. (August 13, 1924 – December 7, 2015) was an American sociologist known for contributions to the sociology of religion, social inequality, and introducing the ecological-evolutionary theory. He spent much of his career as a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he served as chair of the Department of Sociology, 1969–72, and as chair of the Division of Social Sciences, 1976-78.\n\nLenski was born and raised in Washington, DC, the son of a Lutheran pastor, the grandson of German-born theologian Richard Charles Henry Lenski, and the nephew of children's author Lois Lenski. He attended Yale University where he received a BA degree in 1947, after serving as a cryptographer with the 8th Air Force in England in World War II, and then earned his PhD from Yale in 1950.\n\nLenski was awarded a Pre-doctoral Fellowship by the Social Science Research Council, 1949–50, and later a Senior Faculty Fellowship, 1961–62; a Guggenheim Fellowship, 1972–73; and IREX Senior Faculty Exchange Fellowships, for Poland, 1978, and Hungary, 1988. He served as Vice President of the American Sociological Association, 1969–70, and was nominee for President in 1972. He was also President of the Southern Sociological Society, 1977–78 and elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1976. In 2002, he was awarded the Career of Distinguished Scholarship Award by the American Sociological Association.\n\nHis writings have been translated into German, Swedish, Spanish, Polish, and Chinese (both mainland and Taiwanese translations).\n\nLenski married poet Jean Cappelmann in 1948. He and Jean Lenski were active in the Civil Rights Movement and opponents of the Vietnam War. They had four children, including evolutionary biologist Richard Lenski. Following Jean's death in 1994, he married Ann Bonar, widow of sociologist Hubert \"Tad\" Blalock. Lenski died in Edmonds, Washington at the age of 91.\n\nMuch of Lenski's earliest work dealt with the sociology of religion and culminated in the publication of \"The Religious Factor\". He defines religion as \"a system of beliefs about the nature of force(s) ultimately shaping man's destiny and the practices associated therewith, shared by the members of a group. A reviewer in \"Commentary\" described the book as a \"major achievement\" in an often-neglected subfield, and Robert Wuthnow has referred to this volume as \"arguably one of a handful of 'classics' among contributions by American sociologists to the social scientific study of religion.\"\n\nIn 1958, Lenski's empirical inquiry into \"religion's impact on politics, economics, and family life\" in the Detroit area revealed, among other insights, that there were significant differences between Catholics on the one hand and (white) Protestants and Jews on the other hand with regard to economics and the sciences. Lenski's findings supported basic hypotheses of Max Weber's work \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\". According to Lenski, \"the contributions of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber's theory.\" Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist Church, had observed that \"diligence and frugality\" made Methodists wealthy. \"In an early era, Protestant asceticism and dedication to work, as noted by both Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress. Both facilitated the accumulation of capital, so critically important to the economic growth and development of nations.\" However, Lenski said, asceticism was rare among modern Protestants, and the distinctive Protestant doctrine of \"the calling\" was largely forgotten. Instead, modern (white) Protestants and Jews had a high degree of \"intellectual autonomy\" that facilitated scientific and technical advance. By contrast, Lenski pointed out, Catholics developed an intellectual orientation which valued \"obedience\" to the teachings of their church above intellectual autonomy, which made them less inclined to enter scientific careers. Catholic sociologists had come to the same conclusions.\n\nLenski traced these differences back to the Reformation and the Catholic church's reaction to it. In Lenski's view, the Reformation encouraged intellectual autonomy among Protestants, in particular Anabaptists, Puritans, Pietists, Methodists, and Presbyterians. In the Middle Ages, there had been tendencies toward intellectual autonomy, as exemplified in men like Erasmus. But after the Reformation, the Catholic church leaders increasingly identified these tendencies with Protestantism and heresy and demanded that Catholics be obedient and faithful to ecclesiastical discipline. In Lenski's opinion, his study showed that these differences between Protestants and Catholics survived to the present day. As a consequence, \"none of the predominantly and devoutly Catholic nations in the modern world can be classified as a \"leading\" industrial nation. Some Catholic nations - such as France, Italy, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile - are quite highly industrialized, but none of them are leaders in the technological and scientific fields, nor do they seem likely to become so. Recently [1963] some Brazilian Catholic social scientists compared their country's progress with that of the United States and concluded that the chief factor responsible for the differential rates of development is the religious heritage of the two nations.\"\n\nIn subsequent publications (\"Power and Privilege\", 1966; \"Human Societies\", 1970; and \"Ecological-Evolutionary Theory\", 2006), Lenski built on the foundations of evolutionary theory laid in the 18th century by A.R.J. Turgot, Adam Ferguson, John Millar, and Thomas Malthus, and in the 19th and 20th centuries by Lewis Henry Morgan, Leslie White, and Charles Darwin and the many biological evolutionists following him, to propose a more contemporary ecological and evolutionary theory of societal development from the Stone Age to the present. He has viewed the cumulation of information, especially technological information, as the most basic and most powerful factor in the evolution of human societies (though not the only one, as some of his critics have claimed). Lenski has argued that the evolution of cultural information is an extension of the evolution of genetic information with the characteristics of human societies being the product of the interaction of both genetic and cultural influences.\n\nMembers of any given society are united by a shared and partially distinctive culture and networks of social relationships with one another. These ties vary in intensity and distinctiveness depending on the magnitude of the society's store of information and the extent of contacts with other societies. With the acquisition of signals, and later, symbols, the ancestors of modern humans gained the critically important ability to share information acquired through individual experience. These and other later advances in the technologies of communication and transportation laid the foundations for major developments in political and economic systems, social inequality, science, ideology, and other spheres of life.\n\nLenski's theory has been well received. A former president of the American Political Science Association, Heinz Eulau, described \"Power and Privilege\" as a \"masterpiece of comparative social analysis\" and Ralf Dahrendorf referred to it as \"an imaginative and substantial work [and] an indispensable guide.\" \"Sociological Theory\" devoted an issue of the journal to commentaries on, and appreciations of, his work (vol. 22, no. 2, June, 2004).\n\nOne feature of Lenski's work that has won fairly wide acceptance among sociologists, as reflected in its incorporation into leading introductory textbooks in the discipline, is his ecological and evolutionary typology of human societies first proposed in \"Power and Privilege\" and enhanced later in \"Human Societies\" and other publications This typology is based on a combination of two elements: (1) the kind of environment to which the society must adapt, and (2) its level of technological development. In its most basic form, Lenski identifies seven types of societies:\nThese types are often combined in various ways (for example, industrializing horticultural and agrarian societies, such as Ghana and Brazil in the late 20th century) and can be usefully subdivided into more or less advanced (e.g., simple and advanced horticultural societies).\n\nAn important feature of Lenski's theory has been his emphasis on the need for a broadly inclusive approach in theory building. In a 1988 article, he argued that macrosociological theory should be based on our knowledge of the entire universe of human societies, past as well as present, and should seek to explain the major features of that universe, both its uniformities and its variations. This is undoubtedly a feature of the theory that many sociologists find troubling and unattractive because of the tradition developed in American sociology in the twentieth century of focusing theory and research on one's own society during a limited time period (i.e., American society in the 20th century) or a handful of societies (e.g., modern industrial societies) during an equally limited span of time.\n\nAnother notable feature of Lenski's work has been his interest in Marxist societies. This grew out of his concern for the forces shaping societal development. Karl Marx, who had a major influence on sociological thought in the mid-twentieth century, had a very optimistic view of human nature that is reflected in his belief in the inevitability of communism in the future when the governing principle in human societies would be \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\" Lenski viewed the Marxist societies of the 20th century as important, but too often neglected, social experiments that put Marx's view of human nature to the test and found it wanting. His earlier work in the 1950s on status inconsistency (i.e. social class divisions and ethnic tension and discrimination) had received a positive reception among a number of influential Eastern European sociologists who found it a much more effective tool than the communist party's official model for analyzing and understanding the realities of social inequality in their societies, while at the same time providing a useful tool for challenging an increasingly unacceptable Communist social order.\n\n\n"}

These molecules can be organic (chemoorganotrophs) or inorganic (chemolithotrophs). The chemotroph designation is in contrast to phototrophs, which use solar energy. Chemotrophs can be either autotrophic or heterotrophic. Chemotrophs are found in ocean floors where sunlight cannot reach them because they are not dependent on solar energy. Ocean floors often contain underwater volcanos that can provide heat as a substitute for sunlight's warmth.\n\nChemoautotrophs (or chemotrophic autotroph) (\"Greek\": Chemo (χημεία) = chemical, auto (εαυτός) = self, troph (τροφή) = nourishment), in addition to deriving energy from chemical reactions, synthesize all necessary organic compounds from carbon dioxide. Chemoautotrophs can use inorganic electron sources such as hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur, ferrous iron, molecular hydrogen, and ammonia or organic sources. Most chemoautotrophs are extremophiles, bacteria or archaea that live in hostile environments (such as deep sea vents) and are the primary producers in such ecosystems. Chemoautotrophs generally fall into several groups: methanogens, halophiles, sulfur oxidizers and reducers, nitrifiers, anammox bacteria, and thermoacidophiles. An example of one of these prokaryotes would be Sulfolobus. Chemolithotrophic growth can be dramatically fast, such as \"Hydrogenovibrio crunogenus\" with a doubling time around one hour.\n\nThe term \"chemosynthesis\", coined in 1897 by Wilhelm Pfeffer, originally was defined as the energy production by oxidation of inorganic substances in association with autotrophy—what would be named today as chemolithoautotrophy. Later, the term would include also the chemoorganoautotrophy, that is, it can be seen as a synonym of chemoautotrophy.\n\nChemoheterotrophs (or chemotrophic heterotrophs) (\"Gr\": Chemo (χημία) = chemical, hetero (ἕτερος) = (an)other, troph (τροφιά) = nourishment) are unable to fix carbon to form their own organic compounds. Chemoheterotrophs can be chemolithoheterotrophs, utilizing inorganic electron sources such as sulfur, or chemoorganoheterotrophs, utilizing organic electron sources such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Most animals and fungi are examples of chemoheterotrophs, obtaining most of their energy from O.\n\nIn the deep oceans, iron-oxidizing bacteria derive their energy needs by oxidizing ferrous iron (Fe) to ferric iron (Fe). The electron conserved from this reaction reduces the respiratory chain and can be thus used in the synthesis of ATP by forward electron transport or NADH by reverse electron transport, replacing or augmenting traditional phototrophism.\n\nManganese-oxidizing bacteria also make use of igneous lava rocks in much the same way; by oxidizing manganous manganese (Mn) into manganic (Mn) manganese. Manganese is more scarce than iron oceanic crust, but is much easier for bacteria to extract from igneous glass. In addition, each manganese oxidation donates two electrons to the cell versus one for each iron oxidation, though the amount of ATP or NADH that can be synthesised in couple to these reactions varies with pH and specific reaction thermodynamics in terms of how much of a Gibbs free energy change there is during the oxidation reactions versus the energy change required for the formation of ATP or NADH, all of which vary with concentration, pH etc. Much still remains unknown about manganese-oxidizing bacteria because they have not been cultured and documented to any great extent.\n\n\n\n1.

The Canada 2016 Census put the population at 790, a drop of 1.5% from 802 in 2011. The town is named for Frank Watson, an American-born trapper and prospector, who settled in the area at the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nWatson Lake is near the Liard River, at the junction of the Robert Campbell Highway and the Alaska Highway. The Cassiar Highway's northern end is west of Watson Lake. The town is also served by the Watson Lake Airport; the airport was formerly served by Canadian Pacific Airlines and other local and regional airlines, but now only provides corporate and charter services.\nWatson Lake is the main centre of the small forestry industry in Yukon and has been a service centre for the mining industry, especially for the Cassiar asbestos mine in northern British Columbia and the Cantung tungsten mine on the Yukon-Northwest Territories border in the Mackenzie Mountains.\n\nTourist attractions in Watson Lake include the Northern Lights Centre and the much-imitated original Signpost Forest. The Signpost Forest was started in 1942 by a homesick U.S. Army G.I. working on the Alaska Highway, who put up a sign with the name of his home town and the distance. Others followed suit and the tradition continues to this day. As of August 2010 there are more than 76,000 signs of various types depicting locations across the world. The Signpost Forest is one of four roadside attractions featured on the first series of the Canadian Roadside Attractions Series issued by Canada Post on July 6, 2009.\n\nWatson Lake and the neighbouring Upper Liard settlement are the home of the Liard River First Nation, a member of the Kaska Dena Council.

Each end of the belt (sash) may or may not have strings, snaps or buttons that allow it to be fastened about the waist. Examples that lack these were often tucked into the waist. Other variations were never worn but may have been folded and placed inside helmet liners, pockets or packs. Senninbari were decorated with 1000 knots or stitches, and each stitch was normally made by a different woman. Senninbari were given as an amulet by women to soldiers on their way to war.\n\nSenninbari were most commonly made from white cloth with 1000 red stitches added. This is seen as a very lucky color combination. Yellow, red, and green cloth were also used with varying colored threads (yellow-gold, red, white, black, green, etc.) applied. The stitches were usually arranged in multiple rows but might also be placed in patterns creating images of flags, patriotic slogans or tigers. The most common slogan seen was \"bu-un cho-kyu\" or \"eternal good luck in war\". Tigers as stitched or painted artwork were popularly portrayed on senninbari since they were known to be able to roam far away from home and then return safely.\n\nSenninbari took various forms and were not just made as belts. Some forms included \"hachimaki\" (headbands), belts, vests, and caps. The rarest forms of senninbari take the form of good luck flags. Senninbari were most commonly made to be worn around the waist. These examples are known as \"senninbari-haramaki\" (a haramaki or abdomen belt is traditionally worn in Japan to help maintain good health).\n\nThe custom of producing \"senninbari\" originated during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. In their earliest forms, senninbari were small handkerchief sized pieces of square material that contained 1000 knots or stitches applied to it in order to impart strength to the material. The implication of this was that as an amulet, or good luck piece, compounded strength or luck was to be passed along to the man carrying it. In general, senninbari and later one-thousand stitch belts were believed to confer courage, good luck and immunity from injury (especially bullets) upon their wearers. Some Japanese soldiers rejected the belief that the senninbari could protect them from harm. Instead, they felt that this good luck item would simply allow them to be in the position to inflict the greatest damage upon the enemy before offering their life up in battle. Others in the military wore the senninbari as a devotional to the women back home.\n\nA \"senninbari\" could be made by a man's mother, sister, or wife if married, who would stand near their local temple, train station, or department store and ask any female passerby to sew in a French knot stitch. During the most hectic days of the War in order to meet demand, women's patriotic organizations would gather to make senninbari en masse. These were then placed in \"imonbukuro\" or comfort bags and sent overseas to the soldiers. According to the custom, any woman born in the \"year of the Tiger\" could sew either 12 stitches or a number of stitches that added up to her age. Some belts were lined with the woman/women's hair as an added form of protection.

He is normally imagined as a dragon or serpent. Unlike his female consort, \"Mari\", there are very few remaining legends about \"Sugaar\". The basic purpose of his existence is to periodically join with \"Mari\" in the mountains to generate the storms.\n\nIn one myth \"Sugaar\" seduces a Scottish princess in the village of Mundaka to father the mythical first Lord of Biscay, \"Jaun Zuria\". This legend is believed to be a fabrication made to legitimize the Lordship of Biscay as a separate state from Navarre, because there is no historical account of such a lord. Only the fact that the delegates of Mundaka were attributed with the formal privilege of being the first to vote in the \"Biltzar\" (Parliament) of the province may look as unlikely indication of the partial veracity of this legend.\n\nThe name Suga(a)r is derived from \"suge\" (serpent) and \"-ar\" (male), thus \"male serpent\". The suggestions of a formation based on \"su\" (fire) and \"gar\" (flame), thus yielding \"flame of fire\" are considered folk etymology.\n\nSugoi, another name of the same deity, has two possible interpretations, either a \"suge\" + \"o[h]i\" (former, \"old serpent\") or \"su\" + \"goi\" (\"high fire\"). There is no likely etymology for the third name of this god, Maju.\n\n\n\n"}

A single-engine, two-seat biplane based on the Heinkel He 50, the D1A was produced by Aichi for the Imperial Japanese Navy, remaining in service as a trainer at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The D1A was produced in two variants, the D1A1 (Navy Type 94 Carrier Bomber), and the D1A2 (Navy Type 96 Carrier Bomber, sometimes referred to as the D2A).\n\nThe D1A came out of the Imperial Japanese Navy's need for an advanced carrier-based dive bomber, and in late 1934 the IJN ordered the finalisation of the Aichi AB-9 design which was produced as the early model D1A1. However, the D1A1 was not designed by aircraft company (later Aichi Kokuki), but by Ernst Heinkel Flugzeugwerke at the request of the Aichi company. The initial version designed by Heinkel was the He 50, a similar model equipped with floats instead of landing gear. The subsequent model, the He 66 was provided to Aichi who immediately began production of it as the D1A1.\n\nThe design of the D1A, based on the Heinkel He 66, an export model of the He 50, was designed as a biplane constructed of metal, with a fabric covering, a fixed landing gear and a conventional type tail landing skid. Original models had 365 kW (490 hp) engines and it was not until later models that more powerful 433 kW (580 hp) engines were included in the construction.\n\nThe D1A was primarily used in the Second Sino-Japanese War and up to the time Japan entered World War II in 1941. At the beginning of the Pacific War, all of the remaining D1A1s were decommissioned and most of the D1A2s were retired from the front lines and served primarily in training units. The exception was 68 of the D1A2 model that operated as a second-line support until being retired in 1942.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The site remained vacant for twenty years until the Indian River Land Trust purchased it in 1995. The current Garden was formally dedicated in 2001. It is now a Florida landmark and on January 7, 1998, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places under its former name of McKee Jungle Gardens.

From 2011 through 2018, Air Tractor consistently delivered more turboprop-powered fixed wing general aviation aircraft than any other manufacturer; of 601 total worldwide general aviation turboprop deliveries in 2018, 141 (23%) were Air Tractors.\n\nLeland Snow began designing his first airplane, the S-1, in 1951. The 23-year-old Snow completed test flights with the S-1 in 1953. Snow's S-1 flew dusting and spraying jobs in the Texas Rio Grande Valley and in Nicaragua until 1957. He followed-up the S-1 with the models S-2A and S-2B, which were built when Snow moved to production facilities in Olney, Texas in 1958.\n\nIn 1965, Leland Snow sold his company to Rockwell-Standard and was appointed a Vice President of the Aero Commander division. During this time, the Model S-2R was developed and named the Thrush. The first 100 Thrush aircraft were built at the Olney Division before the plant was closed and Thrush production moved to Georgia in 1970. More than 500 aircraft were produced under Snow Aeronautical Corporation and Rockwell-Standard in Olney.\n\nSnow resigned from Rockwell and devoted the next two years designing the Air Tractor. Construction began in 1972 on the AT-300, which later became the AT-301. Air Tractor's first turbine model, the AT-302, was introduced in 1977.\n\nSixteen years later, Air Tractor delivered its 1,100th airplane and soon began expanding the Olney plant for increased capacity. Today, Air Tractor produces a line of aircraft that includes capacity planes powered by Pratt & Whitney piston or turbine engines.\n\n\n\n"}

The nearest communities are Wykoff, to the northwest, and Preston, to the northeast.\n\nThe town of Forestville was settled in 1852 and organized in 1855, receiving this name in honor of Forest Henry, the first probate judge of Fillmore County. Henry settled in Forestville in 1854. The town was incorporated in 1891 and had a post office from 1855 until 1902.\n\nBrothers-in-law William and Felix Meighen were some of the first settlers. Felix saw the need for a general store and stocked it with $700 worth of goods from Galena in October 1853. As more people arrived in Minnesota territory, the town gained a blacksmith shop, a cabinet shop, saw mills, farms, stores, grist mills and hotels.\n\nThe town's population began to drop after the railroad bypassed Forestville in 1868; many families began leaving for more prosperous areas. By 1880, the town's population was only 55 and most businesses had closed. As families left town, the Meighen family began buying up cheap property, and by 1889, they owned the entire town and its surrounding area. By the early 1900s, even the Meighen family had left Forestville, and their general store's doors were closed in 1910, marking the end of the town's life. \n\nIn 1949 the Minnesota State Legislature authorized the creation of Forestville State Park, with the intent to preserve what remained of the abandoned townsite. Mystery Cave was added to the state park in 1987.\n\nToday Historic Forestville is operated as a historic site of the Minnesota Historical Society.\n\n"}

{"id": "1791815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791815", "title": "Organopalladium", "text": "Organopalladium\n\nOrganopalladium chemistry is a branch of organometallic chemistry that deals with organic palladium compounds and their reactions. Palladium is often used as a catalyst in the reduction of alkenes and alkynes with hydrogen. This process involves the formation of a palladium-carbon covalent bond. Palladium is also prominent in carbon-carbon coupling reactions, as demonstrated in tandem reactions.\n\n\nUnlike Ni(II), but similar to Pt(II), Pd(II) halides form a variety of alkene complexes. The premier example is dichloro(1,5‐cyclooctadiene)palladium. In this complex, the diene is easily displaced, which makes it a favored precursor to catalysts. In the industrially important Wacker process, ethylene is converted to acetaldehyde via nucleophilic attack of hydroxide on a Pd(II)-ethylene intermediate followed by formation of a vinyl alcohol complex. Fullerene ligands also bind with palladium(II).\nPalladium(II) acetate and related compounds are common reagents because the carboxylates are good leaving groups with basic properties. For example palladium trifluoroacetate has been demonstrated to be effective in aromatic decarboxylation:\n\nThe iconic complex in this series is allylpalladium chloride dimer (APC). Allyl compounds with suitable leaving groups react with palladium(II) salts to pi-allyl complexes having hapticity 3. These intermediates too react with nucleophiles for example carbanions derived from malonates or with amines in allylic amination as depicted below \n\nAllylpalladium intermediates also feature in the Trost asymmetric allylic alkylation and the Carroll rearrangement and an oxo variation in the Saegusa oxidation.\n\nVarious organic groups can bound to palladium and form stable sigma-bonded complexes. The stability of the bonds in terms of bond dissociation energy follows the trend: Pd-Alkynyl > Pd-Vinyl ≈ Pd-Aryl > Pd-Alkyl and the metal-carbon bond length changes in the opposite direction: Pd-Alkynyl < Pd-Vinyl ≈ Pd-Aryl < Pd-Alkyl.\n\nZerovalent Pd(0) compounds include tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0). These complexes react with halocarbon R-X in oxidative addition to R-Pd-X intermediates with covalent Pd-C bonds. This chemistry forms the basis of a large class of organic reactions called coupling reactions (see palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions). An example is the Sonogashira reaction:\n\nThe first organopalladium(IV) compound was described in 1986. This complex is MePd(IV)(I)bpy (bpy = bidentate 2,2'-bipyridine ligand) It was synthesized by oxidative addition of methyl iodide to MePd(II)bpy.\n\nPalladium compounds owe their reactivity to the ease of interconversion between Pd(0) and palladium(II) intermediates. There is no conclusive evidence however for the involvement of Pd(II) to Pd(IV) conversions in palladium mediated organometallic reactions. One reaction invoking such mechanism was described in 2000 and concerned a Heck reaction. This reaction was accompanied by a 1,5-hydrogen shift in the presence of amines:\nThe hydride shift was envisaged as taking place through a Pd(IV) metallacycle:\n\nIn related work the intermediate associated with the hydride shift remains Pd(II):\n\nand in other work (a novel synthesis of indoles with two Pd migrations) equilibria are postulated between different palladacycles:\n\nand in certain intramolecular couplings synthetic value was demonstrated regardless of oxidation state:\n"}

Wallace\n\nWilliam Hervey Lamme Wallace (July 8, 1821 – April 10, 1862), more commonly known as W.H.L. Wallace, was a lawyer and a Union general in the American Civil War, considered by Ulysses S. Grant to be one of the Union's greatest generals.\n\nWallace was born in Urbana, Ohio on July 8, 1821,the son of John and Mary Lamme Wallace. In 1840, his family moved to Mount Morris, Illinois for a better education where Rock River Seminary was located. \n\nAlthough he planned to study law with Abraham Lincoln in Springfield, he joined Theophilus Lyle Dickey's practice in Ottawa, Illinois, instead. (Dickey was a friend of Lincoln's and would eventually be a justice of the Illinois Supreme Court.) Wallace became licensed in law in 1846 and that same year he joined the 1st Illinois Infantry as a private. He rose to the rank second lieutenant and adjutant and participated in the Battle of Buena Vista along with a few other minor engagements. After this brief experience in the Mexican–American War he became district attorney in 1853.\n\nAt the start of the Civil War, Wallace volunteered as a private with the 11th Illinois Infantry, which was assembled in Springfield. He was then elected the unit's colonel. He rose up the ranks and commanded a brigade of Brig. Gen. John A. McClernand's division of Grant's Army of the Tennessee at the Battle of Fort Donelson in 1862. During the battle much of McClernand's division had been driven back with heavy losses and Wallace's coolness under fire was especially noted. Brig. Gen. Lew Wallace described the colonel as looking like a \"farmer coming from a hard day's plowing\". After this first time meeting upon the Fort Donelson battlefield, the two quickly learned each possessed the same surname and had commanded their respective states' 11th regiments, prompting Lew Wallace to muse the coincidence must have caused \"great profanity in the army post office\".\n\nFor his service at Fort Donelson Colonel Wallace was appointed a brigadier general of volunteers. During the expedition to Savannah, Tennessee Maj. Gen. Charles Ferguson Smith injured his leg and was forced to turn over command of his division to Wallace. At the Battle of Shiloh, Wallace was a new division commander, yet he managed to withstand six hours of assaults by the Confederates, directly next to the famous Hornet's Nest, or Sunken Road. When his division was finally surrounded, he ordered a withdrawal and many escaped, but he was wounded and only later found barely alive on the battlefield by his troops. They carried him to his wife, who coincidentally had arrived for a surprise visit to her husband on the very morning of the battle. She helped tend to him on the way back to General Grant's headquarters in the Cherry Mansion in Savannah, Tennessee. He died three days later in his wife's arms; his last words were \"We meet in heaven.\" He is buried in LaSalle County, Illinois, in Ottawa.\n\nHe was the brother of future Brevet Brigadier General Martin R. M. Wallace.\n\nIn 1851 he married Dickey's daughter, Martha Ann.\n\nWallace County, Kansas, was named in his honor in 1868.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Movado means \"always in motion\" in Esperanto. The watches are known for their signature metallic dot at 12 o'clock and minimalist style. Movado traces its origins to La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. \n\nMovado was founded as LAI Ditescheim & Freres SA in 1881 in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, by Léopold Achille Isidore Ditesheim. In 1905, the company changed its name to Movado.\nIn 1983, the company was purchased by North American Watch Corp, founded by Gedalio Grinberg, a Cuban-born Jew, who fled Fidel Castro's Marxist Revolution in 1960 with his family.\n\nHis son, Efraim Grinberg, is the chairman and chief executive officer of Movado Group, Inc. The North American President of Movado is Alan Chinich. In 2006, Movado celebrated its 125th year of watchmaking.\n\nOn February 23, 1999, Movado Group, Inc. completed the sale of Piaget business to VLG North America, Inc., for approximately $30 million. In August 2018, Movado acquired watch startup MVMT, which was founded in 2013, for more than $100 million.\n\nThe company markets the Museum Watch, designed by the American designer Nathan George Horwitt in 1947.\nInfluenced by Bauhaus, the watch dial has a very simple design defined by a solitary dot at 12, symbolizing the sun at high noon. It was first made by an American importer of Swiss watches called \"Vacheron & Constantin-LeCoultre Watches Inc.\" (not the Swiss watchmaker Vacheron Constantin), and later produced by Movado. Horwitt's dial was selected for the permanent design collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, the first watch dial awarded this distinction. Movado finally settled with Horwitt in 1975 with a payment of $29,000 ($128,000 in 2015 dollars). Following Horwitt's death, Movado started heavy promotion of Horwitt and the design of the Museum Watch. Photographer Edward Steichen called Horwitt's design \"the only truly original and beautiful one for such an object\". The single dot dial now appears in many of Movado's timepieces.\n\nSome Movado watch models have names in Esperanto, a constructed language, such as Bela (\"beautiful\"), Belamodo (\"beautiful fashion\"), Fiero (\"pride\"), Brila (\"brilliant\"), Linio (\"line\"), and Verto (\"head top\"). The company's name means \"always in motion\" in Esperanto.\n\nIn November 2015, Movado announced the release of the Movado Motion collection of fine Swiss-made watches, powered by the Manufacture Modules Technologies (MMT) MotionX technology platform. The collection includes the women's Bellina and the men's Museum Sport models.\n\nMovado Group's brands include Movado, Concord, EBEL and MVMT, plus licensed brands Olivia Burton, Coach, Hugo Boss, Lacoste, Tommy Hilfiger, Scuderia Ferrari, Rebecca Minkoff, and Uri Minkoff. Movado previously manufactured other licensed brands, plus previously owned Piaget.\n\nMovado commissioned \"Time Sculpture\" by architect Philip Johnson. The bronze sculpture with granite base, located outside Lincoln Center in New York City, was dedicated on May 19, 1999.\n\n"}

On 15 February 1918 Sturtevant was one of an international crew of four in a Curtiss H-12B flying boat. The flight officer that day was Claude Chester Purdy, a Canadian enlisted in the Royal Naval Service. Sturtevant, as second officer, was gunner. Two others in the plane were British air mechanic 1st class Sidney James Hollidge and British boy mechanic Arthur Hector Stephenson. With another plane from the same unit, piloted by a South African named Faux, their assignment was to escort a convoy of ships carrying beef between the Netherlands and Britain. The two aircraft were attacked by a group of ten German seaplanes. The group split in half, with five seaplanes pursuing each of the flying boats. Faux managed to elude his attackers and escaped to the west and England, but Purdy was forced south towards the coast of Belgium. As if the situation were not dire enough, another group of German aircraft, led by Oberleutnant Friedrich Christiansen, air ace, entered the fray. Christiansen shot down the flying boat and it fell in flames into the North Sea. Christiansen later told Sturtevant's father that he circled the area and observed three crew members waving and clinging to the wreckage, but that he was unable to rescue them because it was a dangerous situation. Faux reported the attack at Felixstowe, where there was only one aircraft not otherwise engaged. That aircraft attempted a rescue but was damaged on takeoff. By the time another attempt could be made, any sign of the flying ship and its crew had disappeared.\n\nSturtevant was the first aviator in either the US Army or the Navy to be brought down in action.\n\nSturtevant was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously.\n\n\"The President of the United States of America takes pride in presenting the Navy Cross (Posthumously) to Ensign Albert D.

It is home to Royal Holloway, University of London, the south eastern corner of Windsor Great Park, borders the town of Egham and more tightly-clustered village of Virginia Water. Its nearest main commercial hubs are Staines-upon-Thames () and Windsor (). The village grew from a hamlet in Egham in the 19th century, when much of it was sold off from the Great Park in the Crown Estate, and is mostly residential. There are pretty gardens as well as some cycle paths. The village is not bisected by trunk transport infrastructure, however it is connected to the M25 motorway by the Egham bypass of the A30 road, and is centred from Egham railway station.\n\nIt takes up two electoral wards of the United Kingdom including Runnymede (this remains a part of the ancient and reduced Egham ecclesiastical parish), various public greens and woodland at Cooper's Hill.\n\nThe village grew from a hamlet and medieval farmed swathe of land, known as a tithing, of the same name, combined with was a much wider, that is eastern tranche of its area associated with the former Great South West Road and its neighbouring land known as \"Egham Hill\", both in Egham in the 19th century, when much of its land, principally in the western half, was parted with by sale from the Great Park in the Crown Estate. Parts of it in the west remain Crown Estate, mainly the entire south-east quarter of the Great Park (that non-built-up land seen in the map, shown, which is not in neighbouring Berkshire).\n\nThe last fatal duel in England took place on Priest Hill in 1852. It was between two French refugees, Lt. Frederic Constant Cournet and Emmanuel Barthélemy. Cournet was supposed to have been the better prepared for a sword duel. Barthelemy, an extremely questionable individual (responsible for at least two murders by 1852), manipulated Cournet into challenging him (supposedly over comments Cournet made about Barthelemy's girlfriend), and chose pistols for the weapon. He killed Cournet, and was subsequently arrested for murder. However Barthelemy managed to convince the jury that it was not a homicide as in the normal sense of the word, and was acquitted. Barthelemy was widely suspected of being a spy for the new French regime of Emperor Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III). In fact his bullying of other refugees had led to the confrontation with Cournet. However three years later, he was engaged in a crime in London, possibly involving a blackmail attempt that did not work out. Two men were killed, and Barthelemy was arrested. Despite giving an image of bravado in court, this time he was convicted, then hanged. Most criminal historians and writers feel he was repugnant but had defender Victor Hugo, who wrote a small panegryric to him in one of the later sections of Les Misérables, before ultimately also agreeing that \"Barthelemy at all times flew one flag only, and it was black.\".\n\nOn the road north of the halls of residence is the Air Forces Memorial which commemorates by name over 20,000 airmen and women who were lost in the Second World War during operations from bases in the United Kingdom and North and Western Europe, and who have no known graves. They served in Bomber, Fighter, Coastal, Transport, Flying Training and Maintenance Commands, and came from all parts of the Commonwealth, as well as some from countries in continental Europe which had been overrun but whose airmen continued to fight in the ranks of the Royal Air Force. The names in their thousands are inscribed on panels in a courtyard.\n\nThe memorial sits on a hill overlooking the celebrated Thames meadow of Runnymede where \"Magna Carta\", enshrining basic freedoms in English law, was signed in 1215. The memorial was designed by Sir Edward Maufe with sculpture by Vernon Hill. The engraved glass and painted ceilings were designed by John Hutton and the poem engraved on the gallery window was written by Paul H Scott. It overlooks the River Thames on Cooper's Hill at Englefield Green between Windsor and Egham on the A328 (Priest Hill), 4 miles from Windsor and is well signposted as 'Air Force Memorial'.\n\nJust north of the village proper are seven halls. These were last in use for education itself as the 'Runnymede campus' of Brunel University and before which by one of its forebears, Shoreditch College of Education. Today the buildings are used as halls of residence for the main campus at Uxbridge and Royal Holloway, Englefield Green. The halls were named after Shoreditch staff: Scrivens, Marshall, Bradley, Reed and Rowan save for President Hall, where the College president lived, and College Hall that were both named in its Royal Indian Engineering College period. Embellished Neo Gothic and similar style stone and brick mixture buildings, they were built by Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt, who had been Isambard Kingdom Brunel's architect for London Paddington station and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, now the Judge Institute. Corridors in President and College Halls were named after prominent British and Anglo-Indian figures, such as George Canning, Warren Hastings, Richard Wellesley and Charles Cornwallis.\n\nIn 2007, Brunel advertised the buildings for sale. Royal Holloway looked for provision of a quota of student accommodation to complement its adjacent Kingswood Hall. In June 2007 it was acquired by developer Oracle for £46m (). Englefield Green Village Residents Association members voted to remind Runnymede Borough Council that any expansion of buildings should be in keeping with the village architecture and density as locally interpreted.\n\nGilbert's \"Statue of Eros\" on the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain, Piccadilly Circus, was kept in the college during World War II.\n\nIt is represented in Parliament by Conservative MP for Runnymede, Philip Hammond. The village is divided into two wards for the purpose of Borough Council elections – East (Cllr Jap Sohi, Cllr Marisa Heath) and West (Cllr Mike Kusneraitis, Cllr Nigel King, Cllr Nick Prescot). The village is represented on Surrey County Council by Cllr Marisa Heath.\n\nMarilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller, then newlyweds, spent four months (mid-July to November) in 1956, including their honeymoon, in Parkside House, Englefield Green for the duration of Monroe's work on the film \"The Prince and the Showgirl\" with Laurence Olivier.\n\nSaudi billionaire Walid Juffali owned Bishopsgate House and its 42-acre estate from about 2001 until his death in 2016.\nLeslie Charteris, author of the Simon Templar novels, spent the final years of his life in Englefield Green, near the Barley Mow.\n\n\n\n"}

On 12 March 1964, Pope Paul VI appointed him Archbishop of Olinda e Recife.\n\nDuring his tenure, Câmara was informally called the 'Bishop of the slums' for his clear position on the side of the urban poor. With other clerics, he encouraged peasants to free themselves from their conventional fatalistic outlook by studying the gospels in small groups and proposing the search for social change from their readings. He was active in the formation of the Brazilian Bishops’ Conference in 1952, and served as its first general secretary until 1964. In 1959 he founded in Rio de Janeiro, a philanthropic organization to fight poverty and social injustice by facilitating the contraction of loans by poorer populations.\n\nHe attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council and played a significant role in drafting the \"Pastoral Constitution on The Church in the Modern World\". On 16 November 1965, a few days before the Council ended, 40 bishops led by bishop Hélder Câmara met at night in the Catacombs of Domitilla outside Rome. They celebrated the Eucharist and signed a document under the title of the Pact of the Catacombs. In 13 points, they challenged their brother bishops to live lives of evangelical poverty: without honorific titles, privileges, and worldly ostentation. They taught that \"the collegiality of the bishops finds its supreme evangelical realization in jointly serving the two-thirds of humanity who live in physical, cultural, and moral misery\". They called for openness \"to all, no matter what their beliefs\".\n\nUnder the guidance of archbishop Hélder Câmara, the Roman Catholic church in Brazil became an outspoken critic of the 1964-85 military dictatorship and a powerful movement for social change. Câmara spoke out and wrote about the implications of using violence to repress rebellion resulting from poverty and injustice in other venues than Brazil. Traditionalist Catholics urged the military government to arrest Câmara for his support of land reform and Câmara's colleague, Father Antônio Henrique Pereira Neto, was murdered by unknown conservative forces.\n\nA proponent of liberation theology, he was Archbishop of the Diocese of Olinda and Recife from 1964 to 1985, during a period when the country had a series of military rulers. Liberation theology politicised the church's charitable work and brought criticisms that it was encouraging the armed revolutionary struggles that swept Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nHe published \"Spiral of Violence\" (1971), a short tract written when the United States was immersed in a still escalating Vietnam War. It is distinctive for linking structural injustice (Level 1 violence) with escalating rebellion (Level 2 violence) and repressive reaction (Level 3 violence). In it, Câmara called on the youth of the world to take steps to break the spiral, saying their elders became addicted to those escalating steps. By the early 21st century, this book had been out of print in the United Kingdom for about 20 years. A scanned version in English is available on the web at the link given below.\n\nHe died in Recife on 27 August 1999 at the age of 90.\n\nCâmara had some controversial views, endorsing the position of the Orthodox church that spouses who were abandoned should be allowed to remarry within the Church. He criticized Pope Paul VI's removal of artificial contraception from the purview of Vatican II as \"a mistake\" meant to \"torture spouses, to disturb peace of many homes\", \"a new condemnation of Galileo\", \"the death of the Council\" and \"the practical denial of collegiality\". However, by Humanae Vitae, he had changed his mind about contraception, being the first person to telegram the Vatican's Secretariat of State praising the controversial encyclical.\n\nIn his famous interview with Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci, he also stated that, despite his support for non-violence, he did not oppose violent tactics: \"And I respect a lot priests with rifles on their shoulders; I never said that to use weapons against an oppressor is immoral or anti-Christian. But that's not my choice, not my road, not my way to apply the Gospels\".\n\nCâmara identified himself as a socialist and not as a Marxist, and while disagreeing with Marxism, had Marxist sympathies. In the Oriana Fallaci interview he stated, \"My socialism is special, its a socialism that respects the human person and goes back to the Gospels. My socialism it is justice.\" He said, concerning Marx, that while he disagreed with his conclusions, he agreed with his analysis of the capitalist society.\n\n\nOn 27 May 2014, the Archbishop of Olinda and Recife, Archbishop Antônio Fernando Saburido announced that he was sending a letter to the Vatican requesting the opening of the process of canonization of Archbishop Hélder. The letter was received by the Vatican on 16 February 2015, and less than ten days later, the assent was given by the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints, with which it received the title of Servant of God on 7 April 2015. The opening of the beatification process was called for 3 May at Olinda Cathedral. The installation of the court on that date marked the beginning of the diocesan phase of the beatification process.\n\nin the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil, Archbishop Hélder is already in the calendar of saints and his feast day is celebrated on 27 August.\n\n"}

After the battle, the victorious Viking chief Harald Fairhair proclaimed himself the first king of the Norwegians, merging several petty kingdoms under a single monarch for the first time.\n\nAlthough most scholars currently tend to regard the unification as a process lasting centuries, rather than being the result of a single battle, the Battle of Hafrsfjord ranks high in the popular imagination of Norway. It was the conclusion of King Harald I of Norway's declaration to become the sole ruler of Norway. This battle may well have been the largest in Norway up to that time and for a substantial time afterward.\n\nIt was formerly believed that this battle was the decisive event in the unification of Norway. According to Snorri's saga, King Harald controlled large parts of Norway's southeast portion before the battle; but other sources claim that the eastern portion of Norway was under the Danish king. The Battle of Hafrsfjord marks the final crushing of opposition from Norway's southwestern portion (primarily Rogaland, but also chieftains from the Sognefjord area). This made it possible for King Harald to subdue the country and collect taxes from a large part of it. Later historiography regarded him as the first legitimate King of Norway. Many of the defeated who would not submit to Harald's rule emigrated to Iceland (q.v.).\nThe exact year of the battle is unknown, but is generally considered to have taken place between 870 and 900. This uncertainty is due to lack of sources, and partly because the Christian calendar was not introduced at the time. The sagas follow the convention of counting the number of winters passed since an event.\n\nA traditional date of the event, the year 872, is a 19th-century estimate. In the 1830s, the historian Rudolf Keyser counted the number of years backwards from the Battle of Svolder as recorded in Snorri Sturluson's \"Heimskringla\", dating the battle to 872. Keyser's chronology was popularized by the works of the historian P. A. Munch, and by that time still unchallenged, this year was chosen for the millennial celebration of the unification of the Norwegian state in 1872. \nIn the 1920s, using similar methods as Keyser but highly critical to the reliability of the sagas, the historian Halvdan Koht dated the battle to about 900. For the next fifty years, this chronology was regarded by most scholars as being most likely. In the 1970s, the Icelandic historian Ólafia Einarsdóttir concluded that the battle took place somewhere between 870 and 875. However still disputed, most scholars will agree that the battle took place during the 880s.\n\nThe national monument of Haraldshaugen was raised in 1872 to commemorate the Battle of Hafrsfjord. In 1983, the monument and landmark The Swords in the Rock (\"Sverd i fjell\") was designed by Fritz Røed and raised at Hafrsfjord in memory of the battle.\n\nThe only contemporary source to this event is from \"Haraldskvæthi or Hrafnsmól\" (Lay of Harold), a ballad written by , the court poet of King Harald Fairhair. The ballad is very simple, dramatic and illustrative.\n\nThe most well-known source of the battle is Harald Fairhair's saga in \"Heimskringla\" written by Snorri Sturluson more than 300 years after the battle took place. Snorri gives a vivid and detailed description of the battle, although some historians continue to debate the historical accuracy of Snorri's work:\n\n\n\nIn Norwegian\n\n"}

He played on over 460 RCA cuts with Elvis.\n\nNicknamed \"D.J.\", Fontana was employed by the Louisiana Hayride to be an in-house drummer on its Saturday night radio broadcast.\n\nFontana joined a band (originally assembled by Sam Phillips) that was without a drummer. The band included Scotty Moore (lead guitar), Bill Black (bass), and Elvis Presley (rhythm guitar). They called themselves The Blue Moon Boys. This became the band that would perform and record the vast majority of Presley's hits of the 1950s. Along with the occasional piano and backing vocals from the Jordanaires, The Blue Moon Boys played on several Elvis hits, including \"Heartbreak Hotel\", \"Hound Dog\", \"Don't Be Cruel\", and \"Jailhouse Rock\". The band toured extensively. Throughout 1956 and 1957, the band had several television appearances, which included \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". The band broke up in 1958 and Black never played with Fontana or Presley again afterward. He died in 1965. Although the band had officially broken up, Fontana and Elvis still regularly played and recorded together throughout the 1960s. Moore would sometimes join them. In 1968, Fontana performed on the NBC television special, often referred to as Elvis' 'Comeback' Special.\n\nStan Lynch said of Fontana: \"Armed with accuracy, power, swing, dynamics, great time and — the biggest compliment of all — simplicity whenever it was best, D.J. rocked the greatest singer and the greatest songs ... ever.

{"id": "1791929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791929", "title": "Old Windsor", "text": "Old Windsor\n\nOld Windsor is a large village and civil parish, in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, in Berkshire, England. It is bound by the River Thames to the east and Windsor Great Park to the west.\n\nThe name originates from old English \"Windles-ore\", \"Windlesora\", or \"winch by the riverside\". The village was originally called Windsor, until the (now larger) town of New Windsor, from the village, assumed the name. Windsor is first mentioned in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\".\n\nOld Windsor was once the site of an important palace of the Saxon Kings. The settlement is documented as a defended royal manor in Edward the Confessor's time, but archaeological evidence suggests royal connections had existed since at least the 9th century. The saxon royal site was excavated between 1953 and 1958, and the finds are at Reading Museum. Edward gave the manor to the Abbot of Westminster in 1066, but it was soon taken back into royal possession by William the Conqueror. Old Windsor was popular with the monarch because of its convenient location; near to the river for transport and Windsor Forest for hunting. Old Windsor was also an early minster location and market, probably associated with a lock, and important riverside mill complex. The Saxon palace was eventually superseded by the Norman Windsor Castle, at 'New' Windsor. The medieval manor house, however, became a popular royal hunting lodge while the castle was still a fortress rather than a comfortable residence.\n\nAt the southern end of the village, is the historic Beaumont Estate. First mention of the estate is recorded around the year 1300, when the estate, and much of the surrounding area was under the ownership of Hugo de Remenham. The estate was, at the time, known as Remenham, and occupied a larger area that it does now, stretching all the way down to the river, and including the historic pub, the Bells of Ouzeley. After changing hands a few times, the estate was bought by Henry Frederick Tynne who had the house redesigned in 1705 by architect James Gibbs, renamed it Bowman's Lodge. The estate was acquired in the mid-eighteenth century by Sophia, Duchess of Kent. In 1751 the estate was bought by the Duke of Roxburghe for his son, the Marquess of Beaumont, who renamed it Beaumont Lodge. It was bought in 1786 by Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General of India, and most notable resident of the estate, for £12,000. In 1790, the owner Henry Griffith had Windsorian architect Henry Emlyn rebuild, and modify the house. The estate was sold in 1805 for £14,000 to Viscount Ashbrook, a friend of George IV. After the Viscount's death in 1846, the Bells of Ouzeley pub was sold by his widow, and in 1854, she sold the estate to the Society of Jesus, who used it as Beaumont College. In 1861 it became the St. Stanislaus College, Beaumont; a Catholic boarding school for boys. In 1967, the school closed, and moved to merge with Stonyhurst College, in Lancashire. The estate was subsequently bought by the computer company ICL, and then by Hayley Conference Centres, in 2003.\n\nA chapel at Beaumont is said to be the inspiration for the chapel in Evelyn Waugh's \"Brideshead Revisited\". Waugh spent time in Windsor, whilst in the armed forces.\n\nThe parish of Old Windsor contains two Church of England churches: the parish Church of St Peter and St Andrew, and the Mission Church of St Luke.\n\nThe Parish Church was probably built on the site of a chapel attached to the hunting lodge of Edward the Confessor. After the original building was destroyed by French soldiers, the church was rebuilt in 1218. In 1865, an extensive restoration plan was carried out by Giles Gilbert Scott which included the removal of a porch which had been added onto the building during the Georgian period. A spire was also built to replace the cupola, and three bells were added to the original five, dating from 1775. On Easter Day 2008, the church suffered a serious fire, but has since been restored.\n\nThe original church of St Luke was built in 1867, but after falling into disrepair, was replaced by a newer building in the 1960s. The church contains a carpet which was bought in 1960 from Westminster Abbey, where it had been used during the coronation.\n\nOld Windsor is home to five pubs (the Bells of Ouzeley, the Fox and Castle, the Jolly Gardeners, the Oxford Blue, and the Union Inn; and one members club, The Old Windsor Club. There are also a small number of local shops and several restaurants.\n\nOld Windsor is home to two state schools — King's Court First School and St Peter's Church of England Middle School — and St John's Beaumont independent school. St John's Beaumont was opened in 1888, originally a preparatory school for the Jesuit public school, Beaumont College, which was also situated in Old Windsor. Beaumont College was closed in 1967.\n\nWindsor Great Park is largely within the bounds of Old Windsor, including both the Royal and Cumberland Lodges.\n\nOld Windsor is, or has been, the home of several famous people, including:\n\nOld Windsor lies on the south bank of the River Thames, southeast of the town of Windsor. It is near to the villages of Englefield Green and Datchet, and is connected by a towpath to Old Windsor Lock. The parish church lies on the edge of the village by the river, at the site of the original settlement.\n\nOld Windsor is approximately 5 minutes' drive from Windsor and 20 minutes from London Heathrow Airport, and is near to the M4 and M25 motorways. The nearest railway station is at Datchet and is just under away.\n\n"}

News of this act was published that evening in the \"Pennsylvania Evening Post\" and the next day in the \"Pennsylvania Gazette\". The Declaration of Independence is the formal document which officially announced and explained the resolution, approved two days later on July 4, 1776.\n\nThe resolution is named for Richard Henry Lee of Virginia who proposed it to Congress after receiving instructions from the Virginia Convention and its President Edmund Pendleton. Lee's full resolution had three parts which were considered by Congress on June 7, 1776. Along with the independence issue, it also proposed to establish a plan for ensuing American foreign relations, and to prepare a plan of a confederation for the states to consider. Congress decided to address each of these three parts separately.\n\nSome sources indicate that Lee used the language from the Virginia Convention's instructions almost verbatim. Voting was delayed for several weeks on the first part of the resolution while state support and legislative instruction for independence were consolidated, but the press of events forced the other less-discussed parts to proceed immediately. On June 10, Congress decided to form a committee to draft a declaration of independence in case the resolution should pass. On June 11, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert R. Livingston were appointed as the Committee of Five to accomplish this. That same day, Congress decided to establish two other committees to develop the resolution's last two parts. The following day, another committee of five (John Dickinson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Benjamin Harrison V, and Robert Morris) was established to prepare a plan of treaties to be proposed to foreign powers; a third committee was created, consisting of one member from each colony, to prepare a draft of a constitution for confederation of the states.\n\nThe committee appointed to prepare a plan of treaties made its first report on July 18, largely in the writing of John Adams. A limited printing of the document was authorized, and it was reviewed and amended by Congress over the next five weeks. On August 27, the amended plan of treaties was referred back to the committee to develop instructions concerning the amendments, and Richard Henry Lee and James Wilson were added to the committee. Two days later, the committee was empowered to prepare further instructions and report back to Congress. The formal version of the plan of treaties was adopted on September 17. On September 24, Congress approved negotiating instructions for commissioners to obtain a treaty with France, based on the template provided in the plan of treaties; the next day, Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, and Thomas Jefferson were elected commissioners to the court of France. Alliance with France was considered vital if the war with Britain was to be won and the newly declared country was to survive.\n\nThe committee drafting a plan of confederation was chaired by John Dickinson; they presented their initial results to Congress on July 12, 1776. Long debates followed on such issues as sovereignty, the exact powers to be given the confederate government, whether to have a judiciary, and voting procedures. The final draft of the Articles of Confederation was prepared during the summer of 1777 and approved by Congress for ratification by the individual states on November 15, 1777, after a year of debate. It continued in use from that time onward, although it was not ratified by all states until four years later on March 1, 1781.\n\nWhen the American Revolutionary War began in 1775, few colonists in British North America openly advocated independence from Great Britain. Support for independence grew steadily in 1776, especially after the publication of Thomas Paine's pamphlet \"Common Sense\" in January of that year. In the Second Continental Congress, the movement towards independence was guided principally by an informal alliance of delegates eventually known as the \"Adams-Lee Junto\", after Samuel Adams and John Adams of Massachusetts and Richard Henry Lee of Virginia.\n\nOn May 15, 1776, the revolutionary Virginia Convention, then meeting in Williamsburg, passed a resolution instructing Virginia's delegates in the Continental Congress \"to propose to that respectable body to declare the United Colonies free and independent States, absolved from all allegiance to, or dependence upon, the Crown or Parliament of Great Britain\". In accordance with those instructions, on June 7, Richard Henry Lee proposed the resolution to Congress and it was seconded by John Adams.\n\nResolved, That these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.\n\nThat it is expedient forthwith to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances.\n\nThat a plan of confederation be prepared and transmitted to the respective Colonies for their consideration and approbation.\n\nCongress as a whole was not yet ready to declare independence at that moment, because the delegates from some of the colonies, including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York, had not yet been authorized to vote for independence. Voting on the first clause of Lee's resolution was therefore postponed for three weeks while advocates of independence worked to build support in the colonial governments for the resolution. Meanwhile, a Committee of Five was appointed to prepare a formal declaration so that it would be ready when independence, which almost everyone recognized was now inevitable, was approved. The committee prepared a declaration of independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson, and presented it to Congress on June 28, 1776.\n\nThe declaration was set aside while the resolution of independence was debated for several days. The vote on the independence section of the Lee resolution had been postponed until Monday, July 1, when it was taken up by the Committee of the Whole. At the request of South Carolina, the resolution was not acted upon until the following day in the hope of securing unanimity. A trial vote had been tested where it was found that South Carolina and Pennsylvania were in the negative, with Delaware split in a tie between its two delegates. The vote was held on July 2, with critical changes happening between Monday and Tuesday. Edward Rutledge was able to persuade South Carolina delegates to vote yes, two Pennsylvania delegates were persuaded to be absent, and Caesar Rodney had been sent for through the night to break Delaware's tie, so Lee's resolution of independence was approved by 12 of the 13 colonies. Delegates from the Colony of New York still lacked instructions to vote for independence, so they abstained on this vote, although the New York Provincial Congress voted on July 9 to \"join with the other colonies in supporting\" independence.\n\nThe Lee Resolution's passage was reported at the time as the colonies' definitive declaration of independence from Great Britain. The \"Pennsylvania Evening Post\" reported on July 2:\nThis day the CONTINENTAL CONGRESS declared the UNITED COLONIES FREE and INDEPENDENT STATES.\n\nThe \"Pennsylvania Gazette\" followed suit the next day with its own brief report:\nYesterday, the CONTINENTAL CONGRESS declared the UNITED COLONIES FREE and INDEPENDENT STATES.\n\nAfter passing the resolution of independence on July 2, Congress turned its attention to the text of the declaration. Over several days of debate, Congress made a number of alterations to the text, including adding the wording of Lee's resolution of independence to the conclusion. The final text of the declaration was approved by Congress on July 4 and sent off to be printed.\n\nJohn Adams wrote his wife Abigail on July 3 about the resolution of independence:\n\nThe second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epoch in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival. It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward forever more.\n\nAdams's prediction was off by two days. From the outset, Americans celebrated Independence Day on July 4, the date when the Declaration of Independence was approved, rather than on July 2, the date when the resolution of independence was adopted. \n\nThe two latter parts of the Lee Resolution were not passed until months later. The second part regarding the formation of foreign alliances was approved in September 1776, and the third part regarding a plan of confederation was approved in November 1777 and finally ratified in 1781.\n\nThe following are entries relating to the resolution of independence and the Declaration of Independence in the \"Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789\", from American Memory, published by the Library of Congress:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1791957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791957", "title": "Schnellbomber", "text": "Schnellbomber\n\nA Schnellbomber (German; literally \"fast bomber\") is a bomber that relies upon speed to avoid enemy fighters, rather than having defensive armament and armor.\n\nThe concept developed in the 1930s when it was believed that a very fast bomber could simply outrun its enemies. Omitting defensive armament allowed for significant reduction in drag (there would be no turrets, gondolas or gun barrels protruding from the fuselage) as well as weight (no guns, ammunition or manning crew members would be required on board), resulting in improved performance. \n\nAdolf Hitler was a staunch supporter of the \"Schnellbomber\" and directed the Luftwaffe to only develop medium bombers, while the USA and British developed both twin-engine medium bombers and four-engine heavy bombers. Twin-engine medium bombers, while best adapted as the \"Schnellbomber\", lacked the payload and range of heavy bombers which put them at considerable disadvantage for strategic bombing. In strategic bombing raids the Luftwaffe made do with medium bombers with limited fighter escort from the Messerschmitt Bf 109, due to the lack of a truly long-range fighter. The Allies by contrast used slow but heavily armed bombers such as the B-17 Flying Fortress deployed in combat box formation, with the long-range North American P-51 Mustang initially in escort and later in forward role conducting a \"fighter sweep\" in order to intercept attacking German fighters. \n\nThe first aircraft adopted for the \"Schnellbomber\" role was the single-engined Heinkel He 70, but it soon was replaced by the twin-engined Dornier Do 17 in that role. In the 1937 air races in Switzerland the Do 17 won a number of speed records, apparently demonstrating the value of the concept. However, experience of the Spanish Civil War demonstrated that the Do 17's speed when loaded with military equipment was insufficient to escape interception, and armament had to be added to give it some defensive fighting capability.\n\nBomber development temporarily outpaced fighter development in the 1930s. The last generation of biplane fighters (like the Gloster Gladiator and Polikarpov I-15) that had been placed in service during that decade could not catch the privately created Bristol Type 142 twin-engined light bomber prototype in 1935. However by the end of the 1930s, low-wing monoplane fighters like the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire had entered service, and they had the performance to catch up with the \"Schnellbomber\", and dramatically outgun it by eight to one (only one gun would normally be able to fire back). The Do 17 suffered badly at the hands of the RAF during the Battle of Britain, and its production run ended in 1940.\n\nThe Germans nevertheless persisted in their attempts to create newer \"Schnellbombers\", as opposed to large bombers with heavy defensive armaments which were favored by the RAF and USAAF. Other aircraft recognized as \"Schnellbombers\" by the Luftwaffe were the Junkers Ju 88, the first to be custom-designed for the role, three years before the start of the war, the Messerschmitt Me 410 \"Hornisse\" in 1943, and the jet-engined Arado Ar 234 \"Blitz\" (dubbed \"the fastest bomber\" – \"\"Schnellstbomber\"\"). \n\nSeveral other Luftwaffe aircraft were originally designed as fast bombers, but entered service in other roles; these include the Heinkel He 219 as a night fighter, and the Dornier Do 335 — meant to have a small, ventral weapons bay to accommodate droppable ordnance from the start — as a new \"Zerstörer\" heavy fighter, faster than any other piston-twin of World War II with a top speed of some 765 km/h (475 mph). The \"Bomber B\" high-speed medium bomber design competition for the Luftwaffe started in July 1939 was meant to create an updated design to take over the original \"Schnellbomber\" role by later in World War II, and function with a heavier bombload than the earlier \"Schnellbomber\" designs were capable of carrying, but due to the intractable development problems plaguing them, the continued unavailability of the needed pair of high power output engines of 1,500 kW (2,000 hp) and above each - primarily the complex, 24-cylinder multibank Junkers Jumo 222 - needed for such designs, no production aircraft were ever ordered under the \"Bomber B\" program.\n\nThe most successful \"Schnellbomber\" of the war was the bomber version of the British de Havilland Mosquito. It retained a speed advantage over its enemies for much of the war, and was only able to be effectively countered by specialist versions of various night fighter designs, with the pioneering Me 262A jet fighter being a true potential threat in 1944. The Mosquito ended the war with the lowest loss rate among any aircraft in RAF Bomber Command. The Germans considered the Mosquito a superior implementation of their own \"Schnellbomber\" concept, and being a potential inspiration for the Focke-Wulf firm's own all-wood twin-engined, high-speed fighter design, the Focke-Wulf Ta 154 being given the name \"Moskito\".\n\n"}

Established through a national emergence and a followup of the University of Sindh, the university was established with a status as \"federal university\" in 1951 and designed by the Mohsin Baig as its chief architect.\n\nWith a total student body of 41,000 full-time students and a campus size spanning over 1200 acres, Karachi University is Pakistan's largest university with a distinguished reputation for multi-disciplinary research in science and technology, medical research and social sciences. The university spans over 53 Departments and 19 world-class research institutes operating under nine faculties. There are over 893 academics and more than 2500 supporting staff working for the university.\n\nIn 2009, the university was named by now defunct \"THE-QS World University Rankings\" for the top 500 universities in the world, while it is ranked by \"QS ranking's\" in 2016 as among to the top 250 in Asia and among 701st in the world. In 2019 it was ranked 801st in the world and 251 in Asia. The research at the university is ranked as 'high'. The university has been affiliated with world-renowned and notable scholars have been associated and affiliated with the university as faculty, researchers, or alumni since its establishment.\n\nThe university is a member of Association of Commonwealth Universities of the United Kingdom.\n\nAt the time of establishment of Pakistan as a sovereign state in 1947, the means for higher education and research were negligible and diminished in the country. Responding to the impending requirement of higher learning, Pakistan Government started establishing relevant educational institutions of higher learning and research and thus underwent rapid modernization under a policy guided by Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan. After a heavy political lobbying backed by the residents of Karachi, the University of Karachi was established through parliamentary authorization as a \"Federal University\" in 1951. On 23 October 1950, the Karachi University Act was authorized and after an amendment in 1951, it was enacted by the Prime Minister of Pakistan Liaquat Ali Khan. Its first Vice-chancellor was All India Muslim League activist and political scientist, Dr. ABA Haleem. In 1953 it started its teaching and research activities at two faculties: the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Science.\n\nFor the first two years, the University of Karachi remained as an examination university for the affiliated colleges. Over the years, the enrollment expanded so rapidly that its status was redefined by the government as a \"federal research university\" of Sindh, which was officially attained in 1962. Opened with an intake of 50 students, the university now has 53 academic departments and 20 Research Centers and Institutes, under faculties of Social Sciences, Science, Islamic Studies, Engineering, Law, Pharmacy, Management and Administrative Sciences and Medicines. The enrollment of regular students at the campus is around 28,000. There are about 1,000 faculty members and more than 3,000 supporting staff. On 18 January 1960, the university was shifted to the new campus on a plot of located on the Country Club Road (now University Road, passing through the Gulistan-e-Jauhar), under the vice-chancellorship of Prof. Dr. Basheer Ahmad Hashmi on 22 June 1961.\n\nThe university campus is spread over of land, situated 12 km away from the city center of Karachi. About four percent of the university's students are foreigners who come from 23 different countries in regions as diverse as Central Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and Europe. The university has a high standard of teaching, with many professors being well-known scholars and academics of international repute and possessing Ph.D. and D.Sc. degrees from abroad. In a short span of 40 years, the university has risen to acquire a high status in the field of education in Pakistan as well as regionally.\n\nThe most prestigious research center of the university is the International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences which has over 500 students enrolled for PhD in organic chemistry, biochemistry, molecular medicine, genomics, nanotechnology and other fields. The Husein Ebrahim Jamal Research Institute of Chemistry, Dr. Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Development and the Jamil-ur-Rahman Center for Genome Research are an integral part of this multi-disciplinary research centre. It was selected as the UNESCO Center of Excellence in 2016. The university's physics and statistics departments are well known departments and its research output plays a vital role in the development of science and technology in the country.\n\nFurthermore, the department of mathematical sciences is one of the largest departments in the Faculty of Science, which has a three-floor building consisting of an electronic laboratory for computational mathematics.\n\nThe department of architecture (or visual studies) has produced award-winning designers, architects and artists, who are making their mark in the professional world.\n\nThe University of Karachi's library, known as \"Dr. Mahmud Hussain Library\", has houses well over 400,000 volumes dating back to the 1600s, for researchers as well as for use by students of advance studies and faculty members. The library became the depository of the personal book collection of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan. Established and constructed in 1952, the Dr. Mahmud Hussain Library is an imposing five story and basement structure firmly placed in the center of campus activities. Teachers from over 100 affiliated colleges frequent the university, along with scholars from 19 research institutions. A loan and resource sharing system exists with other academic entities in the Karachi area. A digital library enables the scholars and students to access online books and journals. 25 librarians, 10 assistant librarians and around 90 nonprofessional staff help maintain the library. The building includes six reading rooms for general purposes and six for research. The International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences has within it the Latif Ebrahim Jamal Science Information Centre which is the national focal point for distance education\n\nPreviously called the Karachi University Library, it was renamed the Dr. Mahmud Hussain Library by unanimous resolution of the Karachi University Syndicate on 12 April 1976— the first death anniversary of Prof. Dr. Mahmud Hussain Khan. Mahmud Hussain served the university's Vice-Chancellor from 1971 to 1975 and the library was named in recognition of his contribution to the teaching of social sciences in Pakistan. Dr. Hussain was the first professor the university appointed to its faculty of International Relations and History. He introduced library science to Pakistan by instituting the Faculty of Journalism and Library Science at the university. He also actively worked to improve the status and pay scales of the library staff to make them at par with the university's other faculty members.\n\nThe university publishes books, texts, periodicals and other academic materials in-house through the Bureau of Composition, Compilation and Translation (BCC&T).\n\nThe University of Karachi has 9 faculties:\n\nSince its establishment in 1951, the university has attracted prominent scholars and renowned educationist as its faculty members, researchers and associated scholars.

It was founded by members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in 1873 as Penn College. In 1933, the name was changed to William Penn College, and finally to William Penn University in 2000.\n\nThe university's athletic teams compete in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). The university is a member of the Heart of America Athletic Conference. Before 2000, the school was a part of the NCAA Division III.\n\nPenn College opened September 24, 1873. The college's name was changed from Penn College to William Penn College in 1933, sparking a controversy whether or not the institution had ceased to exist as an educational institution. That matter was settled once and for all by the Iowa Supreme Court which ruled that Penn College had not ceased to exist as an educational institution. In 2000, the name was changed again from William Penn College to William Penn University.\n\nIn 1916, fire destroyed the original campus and Penn's business manager Robert Williams and freshman student Harry Oakley were killed when the four-ton college bell crashed through the main building and buried them beneath it.\n\nIn 1995, William Penn's 'College for Working Adults' was founded, which enrolls non-traditional students in an evening program of accelerated study. In January 2000 the college returned to the NAIA Division II. William Penn is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and a member of the North Central Association.\n\nIn 2007, Musco Lighting, also in Oskaloosa, donated $12 million to the school for various projects—the biggest single gift in the school's history. The money was to be used for of new structures including student recreation, classrooms, laboratories, and a stand-alone Industrial Technology Center building called the Musco Technology Center (MTC), which is home for the expanding Digital Communication Program.\n\nPart of the campus has been set aside as a nationally recognized historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. At the time of its nomination it contained ten resources, which included one contributing site, four contributing buildings, two contributing structures, two non-contributing buildings, and one non-contributing structure. The focus of the district is the Quadrangle, which is the contributing site. Penn Hall (1917), Lewis Hall (1917), the Central Heating Plant (1917), and Spencer Memorial Chapel (1923) are the historic buildings. The historic structures are two Memorial Gates (c. 1918). The Southeast Memorial Gate is located at the intersection of North Market Street and Trueblood Avenue. The Southwest Memorial Gate is located at the entrance to a vehicular drive off of Trueblood Avenue. They were gifts of the classes of 1918-1920 to honor their classmates who died in World War I. Bloomington, Illinois architect A.T. Simmons designed the conceptual plan for the campus and the plans for individual buildings. He also designed the memorial gates; which were erected in May 20, 1918. The use of Prairie School architecture is an unusual choice for a collegiate setting, and it exemplifies how its influence grew beyond Illinois. The Spencer Memorial Chapel is an exception. It was designed by the prominent Des Moines architectural firm of Proudfoot, Bird and Rawson in the Colonial Revival style.\n\nPer the school's website: \"At William Penn University, students are encouraged, but not required, to participate in religious life programming. Programming sponsored by Campus Ministries is Christian in orientation and interdenominational in nature. Campus Ministry assists students to explore questions of faith in a nurturing environment and discover spiritual resources to face life's challenges.\"\n\nWilliam Penn University offers international students the experience of total immersion into American academic and cultural life. Countries currently represented in the student population include Colombia, Rwanda, Brazil, South Africa, Philippines, Australia, Bahamas, Burma (Myanmar), Canada, France, China, Ireland, South Korea, Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nWilliam Penn teams, nicknamed the Statesmen, compete at the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Division I level, in the Heart of America Athletic Conference (HACC); The Statesmen formerly competed in the Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (IIAC) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III level until 2000. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, football, golf, soccer, track & field and wrestling. Women's sports include basketball, bowling, cheerleading, cross country, dance, golf, soccer, softball, track & field and volleyball. In 2018, William Penn University added Men's and Women's Lacrosse as well as Men's Volleyball.\n\nThe men's basketball teams have had significant success, finishing as the runner-up in the 2013 NAIA Division II Men's Basketball Tournament. In 2014 William Penn set a record for points scored in the NAIA National Basketball Tournament.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1791995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791995", "title": "Missing years (Jewish calendar)", "text": "Missing years (Jewish calendar)\n\nThe missing years in the Hebrew calendar refer to a chronological discrepancy between the rabbinic dating for the destruction of the First Temple in 423 BCE (3338 Anno Mundi) and the academic dating of it in 587 BCE.\n\nBoth the Babylonian Chronicles and the Bible indicate that Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem. The Babylonian Chronicles (as published by Donald Wiseman in 1956) establish that Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem the first time on 2 Adar (16 March) 597 BCE. Before Wiseman's publication, E. R. Thiele had determined from the biblical texts that Nebuchadnezzar's initial capture of Jerusalem occurred in the spring of 597 BCE, while other scholars, including William F. Albright, more frequently dated the event to 598 BCE.\n\nAccording to the Bible, Nebuchadnezzar installed Zedekiah as king after his first siege, and Zedekiah ruled for 11 years before the second siege resulted in the end of his kingdom.\n\nAlthough there is no dispute that Jerusalem fell the second time in the summer month of Tammuz, Albright dates the end of Zedekiah's reign (and the fall of Jerusalem) to 587 BCE, whereas Thiele offers 586 BCE. Thiele's reckoning is based on the presentation of Zedekiah's reign on an accession basis, which was used for most but not all of the kings of Judah. In that case, the year that Zedekiah came to the throne would be his \"first\" partial year; his first full year would be 597/596 BCE, and his eleventh year, the year Jerusalem fell, would be 587/586 BCE. Since Judah's regnal years were counted from Tishrei in autumn, this would place the end of his reign and the capture of Jerusalem in the summer of 586 BCE.\n\nA variety of rabbinic sources state that the Second Temple stood for 420 years. The rabbis placed the destruction of the Second Temple in 68, 69, or 70 CE implying that it was built in about 352 BCE. Adding 70 years between the destruction of the First Temple and the construction of the Second Temple, it follows that the First Temple was destroyed in around 422 BCE.\n\nThis date is about 165 years after the accepted year of 587 BCE. This discrepancy is referred to as \"missing years\".\n\nAccording to the Talmud and Seder Olam Rabbah, the Second Temple stood for 420 years, with the years divided up as follows:\n\nThe date of 318 BCE for the Greek conquest of Persia was later confirmed by Rabbeinu Chananel, who wrote that Alexander the Great rose to power six years before the beginning of the Seleucid era (which occurred in 312/11 BCE).\n\nSeventy years passed between the destruction of the First Temple and the building of the Second Temple in the seventy first year, so construction of the Second Temple in 352 BCE implies that the First Temple was destroyed in 423 BCE.\n\nSimilarly, Megillat Antiochus implies that the Second Temple was built in 352 BCE, and thus that the First Temple was destroyed in 423 BCE.\n\nThe figure of 420 years is derived from the prophecy of seventy weeks in Daniel 9:24–27, which the rabbis interpreted as referring to a period of 490 years which would pass between the destructions of the First and Second Temple - 70 years between the Temples, plus 420 years of the Second Temple, starting in the 71st year after the destruction.\n\nIf traditional dates are assumed to be based on the standard Hebrew calendar, then the differing traditional and modern academic dating of events cannot both be correct. Attempts to reconcile the two systems must show one or both to have errors.\n\nScholars see the discrepancy between the traditional and academic date of the destruction of the First Temple arising as a result of Jewish sages missing out the reign lengths of several Persian kings during the Persian Empire's rule over Israel. Modern scholars tally ten Persian kings whose combined reigns total 208 years. By contrast, ancient Jewish sages only mention four Persian kings totaling 52 years. The reigns of several Persian kings appear to be missing from the traditional calculations.\n\nAzariah dei Rossi was likely the first Jewish authority to claim that the traditional Hebrew dating is not historically precise regarding the years before the Second Temple. \n\nNachman Krochmal agrees with dei Rossi, pointing to the Greek name Antigonos mentioned in the beginning of Avot as proof that there must have been a longer period to account for this sign of Hellenic influence. He posits that certain books of the Bible such as Kohelet and Isaiah were written or redacted during this period.\n\nDavid Zvi Hoffmann points out that the Mishnah in Avot (1:4) in describing the chain of tradition uses the plural \"accepted from them\" even though the previous Mishnah only mentions one person. He posits that there must have been another Mishnah mentioning two sages that was later removed.\n\nThe traditional account of Jewish history shows a discontinuity in the beginning of the 35th century: The account of Seder Olam Rabbah is complete only until this time. It has been postulated that this work was written to complement another historical work, about subsequent centuries until the time of Hadrian, which is no longer extant.\n\nIt appears that Jewish dating systems only arose in the 35th century, so that precise historical records would naturally have existed only from that time onwards. The Minyan Shtarot system, used to date official Jewish documents, started in the year 3449. According to Moshe Lerman, the year-count \"from Creation\" was established around the same time (see Birkat Hachama for elaboration).\n\nIt has also been posited that certain calculations in the Talmud compute better according to the academic dating. Two possible harmonizations are proposed by modern rabbis:\n\n\n\nAttempts have been made to reinterpret the historical evidence to agree with the rabbinic tradition, however this approach to the discrepancy is problematic. The reinterpretation of the Greek, Babylonian and Persian sources that is required to support the traditional dating has been achieved only in parts and has not yet been achieved in its entirety. Similar problems face other attempts to revise dating (such as those of Peter James and David Rohl) and mainstream scholarship rejects such approaches. Where and how the Gregorian or Julian calendric differential gets factored in, remains another argument entirely.\n\nThe Babylonian Chronicles are known to be lacking in certain regnal years ascribed to some kings, besides disagreeing in other places with the ancient Egyptian records outlining the regnal years of eight successive Persian kings, preserved in the Third Book of Manetho.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

The municipality is composed of 23 local communities and has a population of 33,321, while the town itself has 14,573 inhabitants.\n\nThe name of the town is derived from the Serbian word \"topola\" (топола) (\"poplar\" in English). The first part of the name of the town was given to designate its location in the region of Bačka in contrast to places with similar names, like Topola in Šumadija or Banatska Topola in Banat.\n\nThe town was mentioned first in 1462 under name \"Fibaych\". This settlement was destroyed in the 16th century and new smaller settlement was later built at its location. Name \"Topola\" was first recorded in 1543, while according to the Ottoman defters from 1580, 1582, and 1590, it was mentioned as a village, whose population numbered between 21 and 23 houses. In this time, the inhabitants of the settlement were Serbs. In 1704, Topola was destroyed by kuruc rebels.\n\nIn 1731, Topola was mentioned as an uninhabited heath. In 1750, the new settlement was founded at this location and 200 Hungarian and Slovak families arrived here from Upper Hungary. It was a district center in Bács-Bodrog County as \"Topolya\" until 1918, when it became part of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed to Yugoslavia in 1929).

He was the Chairman of the National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD), the ruling party, until he was elected as President of Burundi. \n\nIn 2015, Nkurunziza was controversially nominated by his party for a third term in office. Supporters and opponents of Nkurunziza disagreed as to whether it was legal for him to run again, and protests followed. More than two months of anti-Nkurunziza protests, which were often violently repressed, left at least 100 dead. On 13 May 2015, a coup attempt against Nkurunziza occurred while he was out of the country; the coup leader, Godefroid Niyombare, claimed to have ousted Nkurunziza, but Nkurunziza loyalists disputed the claim. Facing resistance from Nkurunziza loyalists, the coup collapsed and forces loyal to Nkurunziza appeared to be back in full control by 15 May. Independent media was shut down and many opponents fled, joining an exodus of more than 400,000 Burundians.\n\nAmidst an opposition boycott, Nkurunziza was reelected to a third term in the July 2015 presidential election. On 7 June 2018, Nkurunziza announced that he would not seek another term when his current term ends in 2020.\n\nNkurunziza was born in 1963 in Burundi's capital city of Bujumbura. He was raised in the province of Ngozi in northern Burundi. His father, Eustache Ngabisha, was a Catholic Hutu connected with the royal family. His mother was a Protestant Tutsi assistant nurse. Ngabisha was enlisted to the ranks of the pro-independence UPRONA party and elected to the Parliament of Burundi in 1965, later becoming governor of two provinces before being killed in 1972 during the Burundian Genocide of 1972 when ethnic violence claimed the lives of between 80,000 and 210,000 Burundians.\n\nNkurunziza attended primary school in Ngozi and pursued secondary education at Athénée in Gitega. He later attended the Institut d'Education Physique et des Sports (IEPS) at the University of Burundi in the late 1980s and graduated in 1990 after obtaining his degree in sports education. Before the civil war broke out, he became a sports professor at Lycée de Muramvya in 1991 while still studying psychology and pedagogy. Nkurunziza became a teacher and assistant lecturer at the University of Burundi in 1992. He also began to teach courses at the Institut Supérieur Des Cadres Militaires (ISCAM).\n\nIn 1995, he was threatened and joined the CNDD-FDD when hundreds of Hutu students were killed or forced to flee. After rising through the ranks, Nkurunziza was appointed deputy secretary-general of the CNDD-FDD in 1998. In the late 1990s, he was condemned to death by court and trial in absentia. In 2001, he was elected chairman. There was a split in the group in late 2001. He was reelected chairman in August 2004.\n\nDuring the Burundian Civil War, Nkurunziza is said to have survived a near death experience. He was wounded several times in the war and was given the nickname \"Pita\".\n\nBeginning in late 2003 and after the ceasefire agreement, he was appointed Minister for Good Governance in the transitional government of President Domitien Ndayizeye.\n\nFollowing a series of CNDD-FDD victories in elections held during June and July 2005, Nkurunziza was nominated as the party's presidential candidate. He was elected president by members of parliament (acting as an electoral college) with a vote of 151 to 162 on 19 August 2005 and took office on 26 August 2005.\n\nHe was reelected in 2010 with more than 91% of the vote amidst an opposition boycott and sworn in for his second term on August 26, 2010.\n\nIn March 2014, Nkurunziza banned jogging, due to \"fears it was being used as a cover for subversion.\" According to the BBC, \"The tradition of Saturday morning runs started during Burundi's long years of ethnic conflict\", as residents in the city of Bujumbura, where the surrounding hills were home to armed militants before 2005, \"would try to vent their fear and frustration and claustrophobia, by running, often in a group.\" The same month, 21 supporters of the opposition Movement for Solidarity and Democracy (MSD) Party were sentenced to life in prison for using \"jogging\" as a way to organize \"an illegal demonstration that turned violent.\"\n\nIn April 2015 Nkurunziza announced that he would seek a third term in office. The opposition said that Nkurunziza's bid to extend his term was in defiance of the constitution, as it bars the president from running for a third term. Nkurunziza's allies said his first term did not count as he was elected by parliament, not directly by the people. On April 26 police clashed with demonstrators protesting Nkurunziza’s announcement that he would seek a third term. At least six people were killed in the first two days of protests. The government shut down multiple radio stations and arrested a prominent civil society leader, Pierre-Claver Mbonimpa. UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon said in a statement that he had despatched his special envoy for the region, Said Djinnit, to Burundi for talks with Nkurunziza. African Union commission head Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said she welcomed a decision by Burundi's Senate to ask the Constitutional Court to rule whether Nkurunziza could stand for reelection. More than 24,000 people fled Burundi in April, as tensions mounted ahead of presidential elections in June, the UN refugee agency said.\n\nOn May 13, 2015, Burundi Army General Godefroid Niyombareh declared a coup via radio while Nkurunziza was abroad attending a summit in Tanzania with other African leaders. Niyombareh had been dismissed from his post as head of intelligence in February 2015. Despite reports that gunshots had been heard and people were celebrating in the streets of the capital, government officials dismissed the threat and claimed to remain in control. Nkurunziza tried to return to Burundi promptly, but was unable to land at the Bujumbura airport because it had been taken over by rebel soldiers. Nevertheless, loyalist forces managed to retain control of the state radio and television broadcaster, the key means of communicating with the broader population, fending off attacks by rebel soldiers on 14 May. Later the same day, Nkurunziza announced that he had returned to Burundi, although his specific location was not given for security reasons. He congratulated \"the army and the police for their patriotism\" and \"above all the Burundian people for their patience\".\n\nThe controversial presidential elections were held on 21 July 2015. The electoral commission under pressure announced on 24 July 2015 that Nkurunziza had won the election with 69.41% of the vote with low voter turnout, the participation rate under 30%. Agathon Rwasa placed second and credited with 18.99% despite calling for a boycott.\n\nNkurunziza was sworn in for his third term on 20 August 2015. Speaking on the occasion, he described his reelection as \"a victory of all Burundians\". He vowed that if his enemies continued to pursue violence, they would be beaten with the aid of God and \"scattered like flour thrown into the air\". By December 2015 over 300 people had been killed; about 215,000 others had fled the country.\n\nIn March 2018, Nkurunziza was named \"eternal supreme guide\" by the ruling party, CNDD-FDD, in the run-up to a constitutional referendum on 17 May that year. The referendum's proposed constitutional changes would allow Nkurunziza to stay in office until 2034. The referendum was widely criticized by Burundi's opposition, the UK, the United States and Catholic bishops. On 21 May the new constitution was approved, allowing Nkurunziza to extend his term limits starting in 2020. On 7 June 2018, Nkurunziza announced that he will step down after the 2020 elections.\n\nNkurunziza was one of seven siblings. Two of his siblings were killed after civil war erupted in 1993, and three others died while fighting in the CNDD-FDD. Only one of his siblings, a sister, is alive today. He married his wife in 1994 and is the father of two sons.\n\nNkurunziza describes himself as a born again Christian, though his rule has involved severely restricting religious freedoms for evangelical Christians and other groups.\n\nNkurunziza enjoys playing football and cycling. He began playing football at the age of five, and played in a team at secondary school and his university. As a University Physical Education teacher, Nkurunziza used his football talents as a coach of “Union Sporting”, a first division club side. As President, he has re-called some of his former players to form a new team of veterans, “Helleluia FC”. In 2004, when he was a State Minister, Nkurunziza created a “Soccer Academy” which is home to nearly 300 kids learning skills in various training centres across the country. Nkurunziza has his own football team, Haleluya FC, which he has traveled Burundi with.\n\nIn May 2015, \"Africa Confidential\" reported that Nkurunziza was said to be preoccupied by his football club, had difficulty concentrating for long periods, and believed that he was chosen by God to rule Burundi. In the national press, his mental health is publicly questioned.\nNkurunziza is also responsible of the persistence of extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests and detentions, enforced disappearances, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and sexual violence in Burundi since April 2015 by the Imbonerakure.\n\nIn September 2019, a UN committee concluded that President Pierre Nkurunziza is personally accountable for serious violations.\n\nPresident Nkurunzia has been awarded several prizes and other honorific distinctions to recognize his endeavours. The awards include Prix pour la Paix awarded to him by accord in Durban in June 2006; Oscar de Paix awarded by Assis Pax International; and Honoris Causa Ph.D awarded to him by Latin University of Theology in California.\n\nIn September 2007, the Interfaith Peace Building recognized his efforts. The Greenbelt Burundi also recognized his efforts in the protection of the environment. The award was dedicated to Mwezi Gisabo, a King of Burundi who refused to scorch the Kibira forest in order to track down his opponents. The United Nations Commission on Peace Consolidation in Burundi decorated him with a peace award.\n\nIn August 2009 in Nairobi he was awarded the Model Leader for a New Africa Award by AFREG (African Forum on Religion and Government), a Florida-based religious organisation with a sub-office in Accra, Ghana. Nkurunziza is the first African president to be awarded with such a distinction on the continent.\n\nIn September 2010, the India–based Unity International Foundation honoured Nkurunziza with the Rising Star of Africa Award after Indian authorities found him to be a role model in peace consolidation and development for the whole of Africa.\n\nIn October 2011 in Monaco, the Peace and Sports International organization granted to Nkurunziza an award for having made sports a tool for reconciliation in his country.\n\n\n"}

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 6, 1998. In the episode Grampa's kidneys explode, leaving him in urgent need of a donor. His son Homer initially agrees to donate one of his kidneys, but after hearing of side effects of only having one kidney, he begins to have second thoughts about the operation.\n\n\"Homer Simpson in: \"Kidney Trouble\"\" was directed by Mike B. Anderson and written by John Swartzwelder, although the episode's premise was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer. Meyer also pitched the sequence involving the \"ship of lost souls\", which received mixed reactions from \"The Simpsons\" staff members. The episode contains references to \"Night of the Living Dead\" and \"North by Northwest\", among other things. \n\nIn its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 7.2 million viewers and finished in 54th place in the ratings the week it aired. Following the release of \"The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season\", \"Homer Simpson in: \"Kidney Trouble\"\" received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nHomer takes the family to a ghost town tourist destination. On their way, their car breaks down in front of the Springfield Retirement Castle, leading Grampa to assume they have come to visit him on his birthday. Homer is forced to take Grampa with them. Grampa drinks too much sarsaparilla, but Homer refuses to stop to let him use the bathroom, wanting to get home to watch an episode of \"Inside the Actors Studio\". After several hours, Grampa's kidneys explode.\n\nDr. Hibbert informs the family that the only way Grampa can be saved is if Homer donates one of his kidneys because Homer has conditions and he is a perfect match. Homer agrees, to the admiration his family, but becomes frightened after learning the risks from Moe, and runs away from the surgery room via the window.\n\nGuilt-ridden, Homer deems himself unworthy of living amongst civilized people and decides to start a new life aboard Captain McAllister's ship. He meets several strange people who have their own tales of misery. Homer tells them his story, but the others are appalled and kick him off of the ship. Homer drifts back to shore, where he witnesses a father and son build a sandcastle and laments his relationship with his own father and children. Homer decides to rectify his mistake and takes off for the hospital.\n\nHomer arrives in time, reconciling with Grampa and apologizing, but panics and flees again at the last minute. His mad dash from the hospital is stopped by an oncoming car carrier. While the driver, Hans Moleman, hits the brakes in time, one of its cars slides off and lands on Homer. Homer wakes up in a hospital bed and is greeted by Dr. Hibbert, Marge and the children. When Grampa appears in the doorway alive and well, Homer discovers that while he was unconscious, the doctors took out one of his kidneys. Homer is angry at first, but settles down after his family tells him he did the right thing for Grampa. They engage in a group hug, and Homer proceeds to pick Bart lower back where the kidney is considering as a potential donor for himself.\n\n\"Homer Simpson in: \"Kidney Trouble\"\" was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Mike B. Anderson. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 6, 1998. Although it was written by Swartzwelder, the idea for the episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer. Nevertheless, the episode still contains several \"classic Swartzwelder moments\" according to executive producer Ian Maxtone-Graham, including Homer escaping on a handcart and the line \"this is everybody's fault but mine\". Because the episode contained several scenes of the Simpsons driving, the animators \"orchestrated\" the scenes by using several different backgrounds. At one point in the episode's setpiece, an arranged gunfight is seen. In the gunfight, there would originally be a man saying \"Look, up on the roof, it's a prostitute\" and shoot her. Although he thought the gag was funny, Mike Scully, an executive producer and the showrunner for the episode, cut it because the word \"prostitute\" had already been uttered \"at least a dozen times in the episode\". According to Scully, the Fox censors objected to showing Grampa giving Homer NyQuil in order to sleep. Scully compromised it by not showing the NyQuil label in the episode. The music that plays during the establishing shot of Springfield Hospital is based on the theme music from \"Ben Casey\", an American medical drama series from the 1960s.\n\nThe sequence involving the \"Ship of lost souls\" was also pitched by Meyer. It was the last part of the episode to be animated, and was completed in one week. The \"Simpsons\" staff were split on whether to include the sequence in the episode at all, with series creator Matt Groening being notably hesitant. \"I was very worried about that when I saw the script,\" he said in the DVD commentary for the episode. Meyer was also unsure of the sequence: \"You don't see it coming at least,\" he said, \"I don't know if it was totally successful.\" Scully thought fondly of it however, calling it \"very inspired\". The English soldier, the French man, and the Peter Lorre caricature were all portrayed by main cast member Dan Castellaneta, who also plays Homer among other characters in the series. The woman on the ship was voiced by American voice actress Tress MacNeille. \"Honeybunch\", the name of the sea captain's boat, was pitched by Scully's brother Brian Scully. The name came from Scully's father, who used to call his wife Honeybunch as a term of endearment.\n\nThe title of the episode is a reference to the 1989 Roger Rabbit cartoon \"Tummy Trouble.\" In a scene in the episode, the Simpsons, outside the Springfield Retirement Castle, try to turn on their car, while Grampa is slowly walking towards them. The scene parodies the 1968 film \"Night of the Living Dead\", with Grampa acting as a zombie from the film. The robot cowboy chasing the robot dancer around in a circle on the bar's balcony is a reference to a scene in the original Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland, where the pirates chased women in a similar fashion. The design and voice of the tuxedo-wearing man in the \"Ship of lost souls\" were based on Hungarian actor Peter Lorre. Also, the bride is loosely based on Miss Havisham\nfrom Charles Dickens’ novel \"Great Expectations\". The scene of Homer nearly getting hit by a car during his second escape from the hospital is a reference to a scene in the 1959 Alfred Hitchcock film \"North by Northwest\", in which Cary Grant's character is almost hit by an oncoming truck. American actor Larry Hagman is also mentioned in the episode, when Dr. Hibbert says that Hagman took all the kidneys and livers needed for donors, while Homer states his desire to watch the episode of \"Inside The Actor's Studio\" featuring F. Murray Abraham. The hospital intercom calls for a \"Doc Martens\" and a \"Dr. Bombay\", referring to the British footwear brand and character from the sitcom \"Bewitched\" respectively.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on December 6, 1998, \"Homer Simpson in: \"Kidney Trouble\"\" received a 7.2 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 7.2 million viewers. The episode finished in 54th place in the ratings for the week of November 22 – December 6, 1998. It tied with a new episode of the ABC program \"Brother's Keeper\". On August 7, 2007, the episode was released as part of \"The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season\" DVD box set. Matt Groening, Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Ron Hauge and Mike B. Anderson participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode.\n\nFollowing its home video release, \"Homer Simpson in: \"Kidney Trouble\"\" received mixed reviews from critics. \n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\" called it \"An odd episode [...] that goes on a bit too long and could probably have done with an entertaining B story.\" They added that \"Homer's running away is funny the first time, but by the second, it's lost its impact.\" They concluded by writing that \"The biggest joke comes from Grampa's need to go to the lavatory on the way back from the ghost town. Which isn't that funny at all, really.\"\n\nMovie Guide's Colin Jacobson described the episode as a \"snag\". He wrote: \"\"Kidney\" offers all the components that should make it good, but it never quite achieves a level higher than average.\" He added that \"Despite a few funny moments, this one largely leaves me cold.\" \n\nDigital Entertainment News' Jake MacNeill wrote that the episode \"runs out of steam\" after its first act, and considered it to be one of the season's worst episodes.\n\nHowever, giving the episode a positive review, Peter Brown of \"If\" described \"Homer Simpson in: \"Kidney Trouble\"\" as one of the season's best episodes. \n\nThe episode's reference to \"North By Northwest\" was named the 24th greatest film reference in the history of the show by \"Total Film\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Nathan Ditum.\n\n"}

{"id": "1792002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792002", "title": "Last Exit to Brooklyn", "text": "Last Exit to Brooklyn\n\nLast Exit to Brooklyn is a 1964 novel by American author Hubert Selby Jr. The novel takes a harsh, uncompromising look at lower class Brooklyn in the 1950s written in a brusque, everyman style of prose.\n\nCritics and fellow writers praised the book on its release. Due to its frank portrayals of taboo subjects, such as drug use, street violence, gang rape, homosexuality, transvestism and domestic violence it was the subject of an obscenity trial in the United Kingdom and was banned in Italy.\n\nThe stories are set almost entirely in what is now considered the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn; the location is widely misreported as Red Hook, where one story is set and parts of the 1989 movie were filmed. \"Last Exit to Brooklyn\" is divided into six parts that can, more or less, be read separately. Each part is prefaced with a passage from the Bible.\n\n\n\"Last Exit to Brooklyn\" was written in an idiosyncratic style that ignores most conventions of grammar. Selby wrote most of the prose as if it were a story told from one friend to another at a bar rather than a novel, using coarse and casual language. He used slang-like conjunctions of words, such as \"tahell\" for \"to hell\" and \"yago\" for \"you go.\" The paragraphs were often written in a stream of consciousness style with many parentheses and fragments. Selby often indented new paragraphs to the middle or end of the line.\n\nAlso, Selby did not use quotation marks to distinguish dialogue but instead merely blended it into the text. He used a slash instead of an apostrophe mark for contractions and did not use an apostrophe at all for possessives.\n\n\"Last Exit to Brooklyn\" started as \"The Queen is Dead,\" one of several short stories Selby wrote about people he had met around Brooklyn while working as a copywriter and general laborer. The piece was published in three literary magazines in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\n\"Tralala\" also appeared in \"The Provincetown Review\" in 1961 and drew criticism.\n\nThe pieces later evolved into the full-length book, which was published in 1964 by Grove Press, which had previously published such controversial authors as William S. Burroughs and Henry Miller.\n\nCritics praised and censured the publication. Poet Allen Ginsberg said that it will \"explode like a rusty hellish bombshell over America and still be eagerly read in a hundred years.\"\n\nThe rights for the British edition were acquired by Marion Boyars and John Calder and the novel ended up in the hands of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The manuscript was published in January 1966, received positive reviews and sold almost 14,000 copies. The director of Blackwell's bookshop in Oxford complained to the DPP about the detailed depictions of brutality and cruelty in the book but the DPP did not pursue the allegations.\n\nSir Cyril Black, the then Conservative Member of Parliament for Wimbledon, initiated a private prosecution of the novel before Marlborough Street Magistrates' Court, under judge Leo Gradwell. The public prosecutor brought an action under Section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act. During the hearing the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate ordered that all copies of the book within the jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court to be seized. Not a single bookseller possessed a copy, but the publishing offices of Calder and Boyars, within the Bow Street Magistrate's jurisdiction, were discovered to be in possession of three copies. The books were duly seized, and Mrs. Boyars was summonsed to show cause why \"the said articles\" should not be forfeited. Expert witnesses spoke, \"unprecedentedly,\" for the prosecution: they included the publishers Sir Basil Blackwell and Robert Maxwell. On the defense side were the scholars Al Alvarez II, and professor Frank Kermode, who had previously compared the work to Dickens. Others who provided rebuttal evidence included H. Montgomery Hyde.\n\nThe order had no effect beyond the borders of the Marlborough Street Court — the London neighborhood of Soho. At the hearing Calder declared that the book would continue to be published and would be sold everywhere else outside of that jurisdiction. In response the prosecutor brought criminal charges under Section 2 of the Act, which entitled the defendants to trial by jury under Section 4.\n\nThe jury was all male. Judge Graham Rigers directed that the women \"might be embarrassed at having to read a book which dealt with homosexuality, prostitution, drug-taking and sexual perversion.\" The trial lasted nine days; on November 23 the jury returned a guilty verdict.\n\nIn 1968, an appeal issued by the lawyer and writer John Mortimer resulted in a judgment by Mr Justice Lane which reversed the ruling. The case marked a turning point in British censorship laws. By that time, the novel had sold over 33,000 hardback and 500,000 paperback copies in the United States.\n\nIn 1989, director Uli Edel helmed a film adaptation of the novel.\n\n"}
{"id": "1792004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792004", "title": "Nedoceratops", "text": "Nedoceratops\n\nNedoceratops (meaning \"insufficient horned face\") is a controversial genus of ceratopsid herbivorous dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous period Lance Formation of North America. It is known only from a single skull discovered in Wyoming. Its status is the subject of ongoing debate among paleontologists: some authors consider \"Nedoceratops\" a valid, distinct taxon, while others consider it to represent an ontogenetic (growth) stage of \"Triceratops\" and thus a synonym.\n\nThe paper that described \"Nedoceratops\" was originally part of O. C. Marsh's magnum opus, his Ceratopsidae monograph. Unfortunately, Marsh died (1899) before the work was completed, and John Bell Hatcher endeavored to complete the \"Triceratops\" section. However, he died of typhus in 1904 at the age of 42, leaving the paper still incomplete. It fell to Richard Swann Lull to complete the monograph in 1905, publishing Hatcher's description of a skull separately and giving it the name \"Diceratops hatcheri\"; \"Diceratops\" means \"two horned face.\"\n\nSince the \"Diceratops\" paper had been written by Hatcher, and Lull had only contributed the name and published the paper after Hatcher's death, Lull was not quite as convinced of the distinctiveness of \"Diceratops\", thinking it primarily pathological. By 1933, Lull had had second thoughts about \"Diceratops\" being a distinct genus and he put it in a subgenus of \"Triceratops\": \"Triceratops\" (\"Diceratops\") \"hatcheri\", including \"T. obtusus\"; largely attributing its differences to being that of an aged individual.\n\nBecause the \"Diceratops\" name was already in use for a hymenopteran (Foerster, 1868), Andrey Sergeevich Ukrainsky gave the animal its current name \"Nedoceratops\" in 2007. Unaware that Ukrainsky had already renamed the animal, Octávio Mateus coined another new name for it in 2008, \"Diceratus\". \"Diceratus\" is thus considered a junior synonym of \"Nedoceratops\".\n\n\"Nedoceratops\" means \"insufficient horned face\". The \"nedo\" is the Russian prefix meaning \"insufficient\". The suffix common among ceratopsians, \"ceratops\", means \"horned face\". It was named in reference to its lack of a nasal horn.\n\nThe nearly complete skull known as \"USNM 2412\" is the only fossil of \"Nedoceratops\". Like Hatcher's other \"Triceratops\" skulls, it was found in eastern Wyoming, i.c. in 1891 in Niobrara County near Lightning Creek. Superficially, it resembles that of \"Triceratops\", but on closer examination, it differs: there is just a rounded stump where the nasal horn should be and the occipital (brow) horns stand almost vertically. Compared to other \"Triceratops\" skulls, it is slightly larger than average (1.8m in longest length), but its face is rather short. There also are large holes in the frill, unlike other \"Triceratops\" skulls known. Some of these may be pathological, others seem to be genetic. Lull suggested that the holes in the frill were the result of \"accidental gorings\" from another dinosaur. However, this issue is still up for debate.\n\nThe following traits of USNM 2412 have been tentatively proposed by Andrew Farke as distinguishing \"Nedoceratops\" from \"Triceratops\": It lacks a recognizable nasal horn.\nIt has almost vertical postorbital horncores. It has small parietal fenestrae (lacking in \"Triceratops\").\n\nThe type species is \"Nedoceratops hatcheri\". \"Nedoceratops\" belonged to the Ceratopsia (the name is Greek for \"horned faces\", \"Κερατόψια\"), a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period, which ended roughly 66 million years ago. All ceratopsians became extinct at the end of this era.\n\nSeveral authors have suggested that \"Nedoceratops\" may be directly ancestral to \"Triceratops\", or perhaps its nearest relative. An ongoing debate concerns the status of \"Triceratops\", \"Torosaurus\", and \"Nedoceratops\". In a series of publications, John B. Scannella and John R. Horner (2010 and 2011) and claimed that the USNM 2412 skull (i.e., of \"Nedoceratops\") belonged to a \"young adult\" \"Triceratops\". Evidence for this hypothesis included the shapes of the epoccipital and squamosal bones, and a neck frill (parietal bone) that had \"incipient\" openings (contrasting with no openings in subadult \"Triceratops\" and large openings in adult \"Triceratops\" formerly assigned to \"Torosaurus\"). The authors were of the opinion that the nasal horn of the USNM 2412 skull could have been lost when the animal was alive or when it became fossilized., and that all three \"genera\" actually represent different aged individuals of \"Triceratops\". In 2012, Farke proposed a counter argument, and suggested that the bone surface texture and shape of the horns of \"Nedoceratops\" indicate an \"old adult\". A follow-up study by Leonardo Maiorino and colleagues in 2013 using morphometrics found support for \"Triceratops\" and \"Torosaurus\" being distinct, valid taxa, with \"Nedoceratops\" occupying variable positions with respect to the other two but generally outside the range of variation, concluding that \"the size of USNM 2412 is a plausible intermediate, but the shape is not.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1792011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792011", "title": "Mari (goddess)", "text": "Mari (goddess)\n\nMari, also called Mari Urraca, Anbotoko Mari (\"the lady of Anboto\"), and Murumendiko Dama (\"lady of Murumendi\") is the goddess of the Basques. She is married to the god Sugaar (also known as Sugoi or Maju). Legends connect her to the weather: when she and Maju travel together hail will fall, her departures from her cave will be accompanied by storms or droughts, and which cave she lives in at different times will determine dry or wet weather: wet when she is in Anboto; dry when she is elsewhere (the details vary). Other places where she is said to dwell include the chasm of Murumendi, the cave of Gurutzegorri (Ataun), Aizkorri and Aralar, although it is not always possible to be certain which Basque legends should be considered as the origin.\n\nIt is believed that Mari is a modification of Emari (gift) or Amari (mother + the suffix of profession) by losing the first vowel. The closeness in names between Mary and Mari may have helped pagans adapt their worship of Mari to undertake Christian veneration of the Virgin Mary. The first known written citation of the \"Dame of Amboto\" was made by Charles V's chronicler Esteban de Garibay Zamalloa in his Memorial histórico español.\n\nMari lives underground, normally in a cave in a high mountain, where she and her consort Sugaar meet every Friday (the night of the \"Akelarre\" or witch-meeting) to conceive the storms that will bring fertility (and sometimes disgrace) to the land and the people. Mari is served by a court of \"sorginak\" (witches), and is said to feed \"on the negation and affirmation\" (that is, on falsehood).\n\nOccasionally the figure of Mari is linked to the kidnapping or theft of cows. The presence of Christian priests in those myths may indicate that they are Christian fabrications or distortions of original material. Legends do not recount any kind of sacrifices offered to Mari under normal circumstances, in contrast to food given to lesser spirits (\"lamiak\", \"jentilak\", etc.), as recompense for their work in the fields.\n\nIn various legends, Mari is said to have sons or daughters, but their number and character fluctuate. The two most well-known were her two sons, Atxular and Mikelatz. Atxular represents largely the Christianized Basque soul, becoming a priest after having learned from the Devil in a church in Salamanca and then having escaped. Mikelatz seems to have a more negative or wild character ; he is sometimes assimilated into the spirit of storms, Hodei, or embodied as a young red bull.\n\nAnother legend presents Mari as wife to the Lord of Biscay, Diego López I de Haro. This marriage may symbolize the legitimacy of the dynasty, much in the style of the Irish goddess marrying the kings of that island as a religious act of legitimacy. In any case, the condition that Mari imposes on her husband is that, while he could keep his Christian faith, he was obliged to keep it outside the home. Once, apparently after discovering that his wife had a goat leg instead of a normal human foot, he made the sign of the cross. Immediately after that act, Mari took her daughter, jumped through the window and disappeared, never to return. This account can be heard as delegitimizing the de Haro family, who had been placed as lords by the Castilian conquerors not long before this myth arose.\n\nOther legends are more simple. For example, there is a legend that when one is lost in the wild, one only has to cry Mari's name loudly three times to have her appear over one's head to help the person find his or her way.\n\nThe people of Oñati believed that the weather would be wet when she was in Anboto, and dry when she was in Aloña. In Zeanuri, Biscay, they say that she would stay seven years in Anboto, then the next seven in a cave in Oiz called Supelegor. A similar legend in Olaeta, Biscay substitutes Gorbea for Supelegor.\n\nA legend from Otxandio, Biscay tells that Mari was born in Lazkao, Gipuzkoa, and that she was the evil sister of a Roman Catholic priest. In other legends, the priest is her cousin Juanito Chistu, rather than a brother, and is a great hunter. She was said to take a distaff by the middle and walk along spinning, and leaving storms in her wake.\n\nIn Elorrieta, Biscay, it was said that she would be in her cave, combing her hair, and not even a shepherd could draw near to her. It was also said that her malign power did not extend to those who were innocent of sin.\n\nFolklorist Resurrección María de Azkue ties Mari Urraca to a legend about a princess of the Kingdom of Navarre, widow of a 12th-century nobleman who lived in the Tower of Muncharaz in the valley known as the Merindad de Durango. She vanished at the time of his death and was said to have headed for the cave of Anboto. According to Azkue, Iturriza tells this story in his \"Historia de Vizcaya.\" Labayru in her \"Historia de Vizcaya\" doubts it.\n\nLegends attached to the Lady of Murumendi, according to Azkue, include that she had seven brothers and was changed into a witch for her disobedience, and that the weather would be warm (or turbulent) when she walked about. In Beizama, Gipuzkoa, they say that if she stays in her cave and if, on the day of the Holy Cross, appropriate spells are cast, hail can be prevented. They also say that she and her husband once went to church in a cart and that upon leaving church, she rose into the air saying, \"\"Domingo, Domingo el de Murua, siete hijos para el mundo, ninguno para el cielo\"\" (\"Domingo, Domingo of Murua, seven children for the world, none for heaven\").\n\nMari was associated with various forces of nature, including thunder and wind. As the personification of the Earth, she may have been worshipped in association with Lurbira.\n\nMari was regarded as the protectoress of senators and the executive branch. She is depicted as riding through the sky in a chariot pulled by horses or rams. Her idols usually feature a full moon behind her head.\n\nMari is the main character of Basque mythology, having, unlike other creatures that share the same spiritual environment, a god-like nature. Mari is often witnessed as a woman dressed in red. She is also seen as a woman of fire, woman-tree and as thunderbolt. Additionally, she is identified with red animals (cow, ram, horse), and with the black he-goat.\n\nSanta Marina, a saint revered in the Basque Country, is a Christianized version of Mari. Basque women still invoke Santa Marina's protection against curses and for aid in childbirth.\n\nThe most accepted syncretism is with the Virgin Mary; she is widely venerated by modern Christian Basques.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1792048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792048", "title": "Irreconcilables", "text": "Irreconcilables\n\nThe Irreconcilables were bitter opponents of the Treaty of Versailles in the United States in 1919. Specifically, the term refers to about 12 to 18 United States Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, who fought intensely to defeat the ratification of the treaty by the Senate in 1919. They succeeded, and the United States never ratified the Treaty of Versailles and never joined the League of Nations.\n\nThe Republican Party controlled the United States Senate after the election of 1918, but the Senators were divided into multiple positions on the Versailles question. It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build a two thirds coalition that was needed to pass a treaty. One block of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty. A second group of Democrats supported the Treaty but followed President Woodrow Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations. The largest block, led by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, comprised a majority of the Republicans. They wanted a treaty with reservations, especially on Article 10, which involved the power of the League of Nations to make war without a vote by the United States Congress. The closest the Treaty came to passage, came in mid-November 1919, was when Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-Treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise and enough Democrats followed his lead to permanently end the chances for ratification. \n\nAmong the leading Irreconcilables were Republicans George W. Norris of Nebraska, William Borah of Idaho, Robert La Follette of Wisconsin, and Hiram Johnson of California. Democrats included Senators Thomas Gore of Oklahoma, James Reed of Missouri, and the Irish Catholic leader David I. Walsh of Massachusetts.\n\nThe lists vary, but Ralph Stone identified 16 in 1963: Borah, Frank B. Brandegee of Connecticut, Albert B. Fall of New Mexico, Bert M. Fernald of Maine, Joseph I. France of Maryland, Asle J. Gronna of North Dakota, Johnson, Philander C. Knox of Pennsylvania, La Follette, Medill McCormick of Illinois, George H. Moses of New Hampshire, Norris, Miles Poindexter of Washington, Reed, Lawrence Sherman of Illinois, and Charles S. Thomas of Colorado. Reed and Thomas were Democrats, the other 14 were Republicans\n\nMcCormick's position can be traced to his Anglophobia and nationalistic attitudes, Sherman's to personal antipathy to President Woodrow Wilson and his domestic policies. Indeed, all of the Irreconcilables were bitter enemies of President Wilson, and he launched a nationwide speaking tour in the summer of 1919 to refute them. However, Wilson collapsed midway with a serious stroke that effectively ruined his leadership skills.\n\nAccording to Stone's 1970 book, the Irreconcilables in the Senate fell into three loosely defined factions. One group was composed of isolationists and nationalists who proclaimed that America must be the sole commander of its destiny, and that membership in any international organization that might have power over the United States was unacceptable. A second group, the \"realists\", rejected isolationism in favor of limited cooperation among nations with similar interests. They thought the League of Nations would be too strong. A third group, the \"idealists\", called for a League with far reaching authority. The three factions cooperated to help defeat the treaty. All of them denounced the League as a tool of Britain and its nefarious empire.\n\nAmong the American public as a whole, the Irish Catholics and the German Americans were intensely opposed to the Treaty.\n\n\n"}

Here she joined the relief mission sent to Russia early in 1922, remaining in the Black Sea on diplomatic duties until 1 April. On 8 July, she departed from Cherbourg for Philadelphia, returning to the United States 29 July.\n\n\"Childs\" conducted training operations, and joined other ships in fleet exercises along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean until 14 February 1925, when with the Scouting Fleet she stood out of Guantanamo Bay for large scale fleet exercises in the Hawaiian Islands and then returned to the U.S. East Coast.

{"id": "1792080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792080", "title": "NHL Conference Finals", "text": "NHL Conference Finals\n\nThe National Hockey League (NHL) Conference Finals are the Eastern Conference and Western Conference championship series of the NHL. The Conference Finals are best-of-seven series, and comprise the third round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. The two series are played in mid-to-late May (early June in 1995 and 2013, due to labour disputes that delayed the start of the season). The winners of the Eastern and Western Conference Finals receive the Prince of Wales Trophy and Clarence S. Campbell Bowl, respectively, and advance to face each other in the final round.\n\nBefore the 1967–68 season, the NHL was made up only of a single division. From the 1967–68 season through the 1973–74 season, the NHL was made up of two divisions (as opposed to conferences), the East Division and the West Division.\n\nFollowing the 1973–74 season, the NHL again realigned. The East and West Divisions were renamed the Prince of Wales and Clarence Campbell Conferences, respectively. At the time, the new conferences and divisions had little to do with North American geography and geographical references were removed.\n\nBeginning in the 1981–82 season, the conferences and the playoffs were realigned. The NHL was hoping to reduce travel costs in the face of a struggling economy and high energy prices. The regular season and playoffs were also altered to emphasize divisional match-ups.\n\nBeginning in the 1993–94 season, the names of conferences and divisions were changed to reflect their geographic locations. At the instigation of then-new NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, the NHL made the change to help non-hockey fans better understand the game, as the National Basketball Association uses geographic-based names for their conferences and divisions, and the National Football League, and Major League Baseball use geographic-based names for their divisions. Therefore, the Campbell Conference became the Western Conference and the Wales Conference became the Eastern Conference. The respective winners of the Eastern and Western Conference Finals receive the Prince of Wales Trophy and Clarence S. Campbell Bowl.\n\nThe Hartford Whalers never advanced to a Conference Final, however after they relocated to become the Carolina Hurricanes, they did so four times (2002 as the eventual Cup finalists, 2006 as the eventual Cup champions, 2009, and 2019). The original Winnipeg Jets never appeared in a Conference Final, and after moving to become the Phoenix Coyotes the franchise did not even win a playoff series until the 2012 NHL playoffs when they advanced to the Conference Finals. Of the 31 teams in the NHL, only one has never appeared in a Conference Final, the Columbus Blue Jackets.\n\nAnother tradition (or rather superstition) that is prevalent among today's NHL players is that no player should touch the Cup itself until his team has rightfully won the Cup. Adding to this superstition is some players' choice to neither touch nor hoist the conference trophies (Clarence S. Campbell Bowl and Prince of Wales Trophy) when these series have been won; the players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy, and only it should be hoisted.\n\nHowever, in 1994, Stephane Matteau, then of the New York Rangers, admitted he tapped the Wales Trophy with his stick's blade before the overtime period in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Matteau subsequently scored the game-winning goal in double overtime against the New Jersey Devils. Following the game, Mark Messier, the captain of the Rangers, picked up and raised the Wales Trophy after it was awarded to the team. After winning the Western Conference, Vancouver Canucks captain Trevor Linden lifted the Campbell trophy. The Rangers prevailed over the Canucks in a seven-game series to win the Cup.\n\nScott Stevens and Martin Brodeur hoisted the conference trophy as well in 2000, after the New Jersey Devils came back from a 3–1 series deficit to defeat the Philadelphia Flyers in seven games; the Devils would go on to defeat the Dallas Stars (who touched but did not lift their conference trophy) in the Stanley Cup Finals. Stevens then also touched the trophy in 2003, after defeating the Ottawa Senators in seven games. Not only touching, Stevens picked up the trophy and made his team take a photo with it. The Devils went on to defeat the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim four games to three in the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nIn 2002, the Carolina Hurricanes hoisted the Prince of Wales Trophy after they won their conference title; the Hurricanes lost their Finals series with the Detroit Red Wings four games to one. Steve Yzerman, captain of the Red Wings during their 1997, 1998 and 2002 Stanley Cup victories, picked up the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl each time, to the delight of the home fans in Joe Louis Arena.\n\nThe superstition held true in 2004, as Jarome Iginla of the Calgary Flames grabbed the Campbell Bowl, but Dave Andreychuk of the Tampa Bay Lightning refused to touch the Prince of Wales Trophy; the Lightning won the Stanley Cup in seven games. In 2007, Daniel Alfredsson and Wade Redden of the Ottawa Senators touched and picked up the Prince of Wales Trophy, respectively, but Anaheim Ducks captain Scott Niedermayer never came close to the Campbell Bowl; the Ducks won the Stanley Cup in five games. Steve Yzerman, captain of the Detroit Red Wings during their 1997, 1998, and 2002 Stanley Cup victories, picked up the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl each time, though his successor Nicklas Lidstrom did not touch it en route to a 2008 Stanley Cup victory. Scott Stevens hoisted the Prince of Wales Trophy during the Devils' other two Stanley Cup-winning seasons in 1995 and 2003. In 2009, 2016, and 2017, Sidney Crosby and other members of the Pittsburgh Penguins carried and posed with the Prince of Wales Trophy before going on to win the Stanley Cup. At the close of the 2010 Eastern Conference final, Philadelphia Flyers captain Mike Richards picked up the Wales Trophy. Jonathan Toews, Chicago Blackhawks captain, did not touch the Campbell Bowl, and the Blackhawks went on to defeat the Flyers in six games for the 2010 Stanley Cup.\n\nIn 2012, Los Angeles Kings captain Dustin Brown and the rest of the team refused to touch the Campbell Bowl after winning the conference finals against the Phoenix Coyotes. The team did not take the Campbell Bowl Trophy on the plane back to Los Angeles. Instead Tim Leiweke, president and CEO of Anschutz Entertainment Group (the parent of the LA Kings), drove the trophy in his car trunk from Phoenix to Los Angeles and showed it to the more-than 10,000 fans that waited at LAX Airport to show their support to their Stanley Cup finalists, who went on to win the Stanley Cup. This was in marked contrast to 1993, when the Kings had defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in seven games to reach their first Final, where Wayne Gretzky and the team celebrated with the Campbell Bowl. \n\nIn 2015, the Chicago Blackhawks took a team photo with the Campbell Bowl after winning Game 7 of the 2015 Western Conference Final against the Anaheim Ducks at the Honda Center in Anaheim. The Blackhawks would end up defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games in the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals. In 2018, the Capitals captain Alexander Ovechkin hoisted the Wales trophy after winning the Eastern Conference Final, before ultimately defeating the Vegas Golden Knights in five games to win the Stanley Cup.\n\nNote: The Colorado Avalanche's totals include two Conference Finals appearances as the Quebec Nordiques (both losses), and the Dallas Stars' totals include two Conference Finals appearances as the Minnesota North Stars (one win; subsequent Stanley Cup Final loss). The Arizona Coyotes' only Conference Final appearance was in 2012 as the Phoenix Coyotes. The Columbus Blue Jackets remain the only active NHL team to have never advanced to the Conference Finals.\n\n"}

It stars Karisma Kapoor, Rekha, Manoj Bajpayee, Surekha Sikri, Rajit Kapoor, Lillete Dubey, Amrish Puri, Farida Jalal, and Shakti Kapoor. Renowned musician A.R.Rahman has scored the background music and soundtrack for the movie.\n\n\"Zubeidaa\" is the concluding chapter in a trilogy that began with \"Mammo\" (1994) and continued with \"Sardari Begum\" (1996). The film is based on the life of the ill-fated actress Zubeida Begum, who married Hanwant Singh of Jodhpur and was the mother of the film's writer, Khalid Mohamed.\n\nThe film garnered the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi and won Karisma Kapoor a Filmfare Award for Best Actress (Critics). It is regarded by many critics as Kapoor’s Best performance (alongside \"Fiza\" where she also played the title role). The film was highly acclaimed and is regarded as of one of Benegal’s best works blurring the lines of commercial and parallel cinema.\n\n\"Zubeidaa\" is the story of Riyaz's (Rajit Kapoor) search to understand his mother, who is not known to him, as he was brought up by his maternal grandmother in the absence of his mother. His mother's name was Zubeidaa (Karisma Kapoor) and she was the only daughter of a filmmaker named Suleman Seth (Amrish Puri). Zubeidaa acts in films secretly, but when her father finds out he forbids her to carry on and quickly arranges her marriage to Mehboob Alam who becomes a Gharjamai. Things seem happy for her when she gives birth to Riyaz. However, a disagreement arises between Suleman and Mehboob's father, and Mehboob divorces Zubeidaa few days after she gives birth.\n\nHeartbroken Zubeidaa then meets Maharaja Vijayendra Singh of Fatehpur (Manoj Bajpayee). Vijayendra is already married to Maharani Mandira Devi (Rekha) and is the father of two children. Nevertheless, he falls in love with Zubeidaa and they get married, but there is continuous turmoil in their relationship. Riyaz learns through Zubeidaa's journal that though she loved Vijayendra dearly, she was unable to follow the stifling customs of the palace. She was also uncomfortable because of her brother-in-law Uday Singh's sexual advances towards her, and his demands of her to have an extra-marital affair with him.\n\nRiyaz travels to Fatehpur and asks many people about his mother. However, all except Mandira, whom Zubeidaa called \"Mandy Didi\", either deny that his mother ever existed, or say that she was a horrible woman who seduced their king and caused his death in a plane crash.\n\nOn reading the journal, Riyaz finds out that Vijayendra had become a politician, and was about to go to Delhi for an important meeting. Zubeidaa felt frustrated that whenever her husband needed help he looked to Mandira for support, and at the last minute she insisted that only she will accompany him for the meeting. The plane crashes, killing Zubeidaa and Vijayendra. It is indicated that Uday Singh probably had the plane sabotaged to kill Vijayendra and Mandira so that he could get both - Zubeidaa and the kingdom.\n\nIn the end, Riyaz gets the missing tape of his mother's only film, from Mandira. The movie ends with he finally getting to watch the film with his grandmother shedding tears of happiness, watching Zubeidaa dancing happily as the spirited soul that she truly was.\n\n\nThe soundtrack was released in 2000 and contained eight tracks, all composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. Lata Mangeshkar collaborated with the musician again for couple of tracks. Other singers, Kavita Krishnamurthy and Alka Yagnik walked away with all accolades for their renditions in their respective tracks.\n\n"}

{"id": "1792123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792123", "title": "Bishop of Hereford (Robin Hood)", "text": "Bishop of Hereford (Robin Hood)\n\nThe Bishop of Hereford is a character in the Robin Hood legend. He is typically portrayed as a wealthy and greedy clergyman who is robbed by Robin and his Merry Men.\n\nThe character first appears by this name in the ballad \"Robin Hood and the Bishop of Hereford\". The earliest surviving text is in the Forresters manuscript (British Library Additional MS 71158), which dates to the 1670s. Relying on later printed versions, Francis James Child collected the work as Child Ballad 144. In the song, Robin Hood and some of his men, disguised as shepherds, poach a deer in an area where they know the Bishop of Hereford will pass through. Finding them, the Bishop threatens to bring them before King Richard, and refuses to grant them pardon. Robin summons his Merry Men, who capture the Bishop and force him to \"pay for\" a feast with the outlaws and to sing a mass for them. Child regarded it as \"far superior to most of the seventeenth-century broadsides\".\n\nThe work is related to Child Ballad 143, \"Robin Hood and the Bishop\", which features an unidentified bishop and ends in a nearly identical way. Both are variants of the episode in the much older \"Gest of Robyn Hode\" in which Robin robs a monk. The Bishop of Hereford appears in the subsequent Child Ballad, \"Robin Hood and Queen Katherine\", in which he refers to the action in the previous work and refuses to bet on Robin in an archery contest. \n\nScholar Stephen Knight notes that there are multiple historical Bishops of Hereford who have been suggested as a model for the character in the ballads. He may have been based on Adam Orleton, Bishop from 1317 to 1327, an antagonist of Edward II of England who became very unpopular during the reign of Edward III. He was a well-known figure at the time the earliest Robin Hood ballads likely developed in the 14th century. Another suggestion is the famously corrupt Peter of Aigueblanche, Bishop of Hereford from 1240 to 1268. However, he would have been much less well known in the 14th century. As the ballad identifies the sitting king as Richard, the contemporary bishop William de Vere has also been suggested, but Knight regards this as unlikely.\n\nThe Bishop of Hereford appears in Howard Pyle's influential children's book \"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1883), based on the medieval ballads. The Merry Men rob him to pay Sir Richard at the Lee's debt. Later, he is scheduled to perform the marriage of Alan-a-Dale's sweetheart to her unwanted wooer, until Robin intervenes. He also appears in the archery contest scene, where the Queen (here Eleanor of Aquitaine) attributes his refusal to bet on Robin more to greed than to the impropriety of his betting. The Hereford Bishop appears in the anime series Robin Hood no Daibōken voiced by Yuu Shimaka, and is portrayed as a greedy bishop of Nottingham and ally to Baron Alwyn (the main antagonist) who desires Marian Lancaster for the Lancaster's wealth; however, he later betrays the Baron near the end and join with Robin and his friends to overthrow his unstable leader. The role of the Bishop of Hereford was played by Harold Innocent in the 1991 film \"\". In this version, he is depicted as a corrupt clergyman who supports the Sheriff and insists to Robin that the latter's father admitted to being a devil-worshiper. This culminates in Friar Tuck, disgusted and enraged at the Bishop's corruption and hypocrisy, shoving him out of a window to his death.\n\n"}

She was operated by the French Line, Costa Cruises, and the Epirotiki Line.\n\n\"Flandre\" was the French Line's first new ocean liner following World War II. Her maiden voyage was considered a complete disaster, as she experienced mechanical difficulties throughout the voyage. The first sign of trouble was when her fuel line filters became clogged with impurities in the oil that she was carrying. This caused her to become essentially \"dead in the water\" for four hours while her fuel filters were cleaned out and her boilers restored to normal operation. This was repeated later in the voyage, after which \"Flandre\"'s captain elected to reduce speed for the remainder of the voyage. Upon arrival at the Quarantine Station at New York, she experienced a short circuit in her main electrical switchboard causing a near-complete loss of power. Nearly three hours later, she had sufficient power restored to raise the port anchor. An additional three hours were required to raise the starboard anchor to allow her to continue.\n\nUnlike most ocean liners' maiden arrivals, where they receive the traditional fireboat welcome while sailing under their own power, \"Flandre\" arrived in New York Harbor and received the traditional welcome while under tow by four Moran tugs, while also running one propeller of her own. Her funnel put out thick clouds of smoke, seeming to almost be straining as it was doing so. She was initially blowing her whistle as she arrived under tow, but after the whistle failed due to her limited power, the ship's siren was substituted. This lacklustre arrival garnered her the nickname \"Flounder\" by Manhattan dockers.\n\n\"Flandre\"'s return voyage was delayed to allow engineers to repair her engines. Following her return to France, all of her 1952 sailings were cancelled, and she returned to her builders for thorough repairs. Repairs would take six months, and she returned for the 1953 sailing season.\n\nDuring her French Line career, her passenger configuration changed several times, with \"Flandre\" running on the transatlantic route for nine months out of the year, and three months cruising with her near-sister . In 1967, she was withdrawn completely, and was sold to the Italian firm Costa Cruises, who renamed her \"Carla C\".\n\nThe first assignment for the newly refitted \"Carla C\" was a charter for Princess Cruises, which marketed her as \"\"Princess Carla\"\" (the ship was not renamed). It was during this time that a set of producers originated the idea of the popular television-series \"The Love Boat\" aboard \"Carla C\". Consequently, the first scripts were written on board the ship.\n\nThe ship proved problematic at first, after problems were detected with the boilers. In 1974 and 1975, Costa replaced the boilers with Stork-Werkspor diesel engines and \"Carla C\" was returned to service around the Caribbean, where she served until 1992. In 1984, the ship underwent another major refit, to ensure safe travel for its passengers for many years to come. In 1986, \"Carla C\" was renamed \"Carla Costa\". No other changes occurred with the name change.\n\n\"Carla Costa\" was a common sight on the San Juan ship dock on Saturdays during that era, and her regularly scheduled route included Curaçao, Caracas, Grenada, Martinique, and St. Thomas USVI.\n\nIn 1992, \"Carla Costa\" was sold to the Greek Epirotiki Line, and renamed \"Pallas Athena\", after the Greek goddess Pallas Athene. For the Epirotiki Line, she ran seven-day cruises from Athens to the Aegean Islands and Turkey. On 23 March 1994, \"Pallas Athena\" was destroyed by fire, which caused the superstructure and funnel to cave in on themselves. She arrived at the Aliaga Company scrapyards on 25 December 1994, one of only two surviving French Line ocean liners.\n\n\"Flandre\" or \"Antilles\" appeared as stock footage in the 1964 \"Perry Mason\" episode \"Nautical Knot\", set near Acapulco, Mexico. The scenes on board were filmed on a studio set. P&O Line's equally popular also appears in the episode.\n\n"}

He instead moved to Qatar club, Al-Arabi.\n\nIn 2007, with the growth of the A-League and slight homesickness, Popovic moved to Sydney FC, signing a two-year deal, with coach Branko Culina also announcing him the club's captain. Popovic scored his first goal on 28 October 2007 from a corner to beat the Mariners 3–2 in front of his home crowd of 17,850.\n\nPopovic announced his retirement on 11 November 2008 after nearly 20 years as a professional footballer.\n\nPopovic competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona for the Australian U-23 team. He began his full international career in 1995 with the Australian national team. Over the next eleven years Popovic made 58 appearances for the Socceroos, scoring 8 goals.\n\nThe highlight of Popovic's career came in 2006 when the Australian national team qualified for the FIFA World Cup under the management of Guus Hiddink. He took part in both legs in the qualifying match against Uruguay. Being replaced in the first half of the second leg, due to injury, by Harry Kewell. The tall defender was named in the competing squad and made his World Cup debut against Brazil on 18 June. He suffered a calf injury 40 minutes into the game and was replaced by Marco Bresciano for the second half. His injury ruled him out of Australia's last match in the group stage, against Croatia, and their second round loss against eventual winners, Italy.\n\nOn 4 October 2006, Popovic announced his retirement from the Socceroos.\n\nHis final game was a friendly against Paraguay that month. He scored his eighth international goal, from a Mark Bresciano free kick, in his final minute on field to put Australia ahead, 1–0 in a game that finished 1–1.\n\nAfter retiring, Popovic moved into an assistant coach's role with Sydney FC, where he remained until February 2011, when he returned to England and to Crystal Palace as first team coach, after former teammate Dougie Freedman was appointed manager.\n\nOn 17 May 2012, Popovic was announced as inaugural manager of A-League club Western Sydney Wanderers. He joined the club on a four seasons deal after requesting to be released from the final year of his contracted role as assistant manager of Crystal Palace. In Wanderers' first season, Popovic was named A-League Coach of the Year after finishing first in the league. In the 2013–14 season Popovic led Wanderers to the 2014 AFC Champions League Final in the club's first attempt in the competition. They defeated Al-Hilal in the final, becoming the first Australian team to win the tournament. As a result of this achievement, Popovic was named as the 2014 AFC Coach of the Year. With poor recruiting, the loss of assistant coach Ante Milicic, and a grueling schedule of matches, the 2014–15 season saw Popovic's team finish ninth in the league and eliminated from the group stage of the 2015 AFC Champions League. Despite an unfavorable season Popovic signed a new three-season deal with Western Sydney Wanderers, which would keep him at the club helm until 2018.\n\nOn 1 October 2017, Popovic made a shock announcement that he had resigned from Western Sydney Wanderers to coach Turkish Süper Lig club Karabükspor. It came less than a week out from the start of the 2017–18 A-League season. After nine games, on 15 December 2017, he was sacked by the club, being given AUD$1.4M compensation\n\nOn 11 May 2018, Popovic was confirmed as Perth Glory's new manager following the dismissal of Kenny Lowe at the end of the 2017–18 season. His first game in charge was a pre-season friendly against Chelsea which the Glory lost 0–1. Under Popovic's management, Perth won the 2018–19 premiership with two rounds remaining.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1792150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792150", "title": "Styracosaurus", "text": "Styracosaurus\n\nStyracosaurus ( ; meaning \"spiked lizard\" from the Ancient Greek \"styrax/στύραξ\" \"spike at the butt-end of a spear-shaft\" and \"sauros/\" \"lizard\") is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsian dinosaur from the Cretaceous Period (Campanian stage), about 75.5 to 75 million years ago. It had four to six long parietal spikes extending from its neck frill, a smaller jugal horn on each of its cheeks, and a single horn protruding from its nose, which may have been up to long and wide. The function or functions of the horns and frills have been debated for many years.\n\n\"Styracosaurus\" was a relatively large dinosaur, reaching lengths of and weighing nearly 3 tonnes. It stood about tall. \"Styracosaurus\" possessed four short legs and a bulky body. Its tail was rather short. The skull had a beak and shearing cheek teeth arranged in continuous dental batteries, suggesting that the animal sliced up plants. Like other ceratopsians, this dinosaur may have been a herd animal, travelling in large groups, as suggested by bonebeds.\n\nNamed by Lawrence Lambe in 1913, \"Styracosaurus\" is a member of the Centrosaurinae. One species, \"S. albertensis\", is currently assigned to \"Styracosaurus\". Another species, \"S. ovatus\", named in 1930 by Charles Gilmore was reassigned to a new genus, \"Rubeosaurus\", by Andrew McDonald and Jack Horner in 2010.\n\nThe first fossil remains of \"Styracosaurus\" were collected in Alberta, Canada by C.M. Sternberg (from an area now known as Dinosaur Provincial Park, in a formation now called the Dinosaur Park Formation) and named by Lawrence Lambe in 1913. This quarry was revisited in 1935 by a Royal Ontario Museum crew who found the missing lower jaws and most of the skeleton. These fossils indicate that \"S. albertensis\" was around 5.5 to 5.8 meters in length and stood about 1.65 meters high at the hips. An unusual feature of this first skull is that the smallest frill spike on the left side is partially overlapped at its base by the next spike. It appears that the frill suffered a break at this point in life and was shortened by about . The normal shape of this area is unknown because the corresponding area of the right side of the frill was not recovered.\n\nBarnum Brown and crew, working for the American Museum of Natural History in New York, collected a nearly complete articulated skeleton with a partial skull in 1915. These fossils were also found in the Dinosaur Park Formation, near Steveville, Alberta. Brown and Erich Maren Schlaikjer compared the finds, and, though they allowed that both specimens were from the same general locality and geological formation, they considered the specimen sufficiently distinct from the holotype to warrant erecting a new species, and described the fossils as \"Styracosaurus parksi\", named in honor of William Parks. Among the differences between the specimens cited by Brown and Schlaikjer were a cheekbone quite different from that of \"S. albertensis\", and smaller tail vertebrae. \"S. parksi\" also had a more robust jaw, a shorter dentary, and the frill differed in shape from that of the type species. However, much of the skull consisted of plaster reconstruction, and the original 1937 paper did not illustrate the actual skull bones. It is now accepted as a specimen of \"S. albertensis\".\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Darren Tanke of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, Alberta relocated the long lost \"S. parksi\" site. Pieces of the skull, evidently abandoned by the 1915 crew, were found in the quarry. These were collected and it is hoped more pieces will be found, perhaps enough to warrant a redescription of the skull and test whether \"S. albertensis\" and \"S. parksi\" are the same. The Tyrrell Museum has also collected several partial \"Styracosaurus\" skulls. At least one confirmed bonebed (bonebed 42) in Dinosaur Provincial Park has also been explored (other proposed \"Styracosaurus\" bonebeds instead have fossils from a mix of animals, and nondiagnostic ceratopsian remains). Bonebed 42 is known to contain numerous pieces of skulls such as horncores, jaws and frill pieces.\nA third species, \"S. ovatus\", from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana, was described by Gilmore in 1930. The fossil material is limited, with the best being a portion of the parietal bone of the frill, but one unusual feature is that the pair of spikes closest to the midline converge towards the midline, rather than away from it as in \"S. albertensis\". There also may only have been two sets of spikes on each side of the frill, instead of three. The spikes are much shorter than in \"S. albertensis\", with the longest only long. A 2010 review of styracosaur skull remains by Ryan, Holmes, and Russell found it to be a distinct species, and in 2010 McDonald and Horner placed it in its own genus, \"Rubeosaurus\".\n\nSeveral other species which were assigned to \"Styracosaurus\" have since been assigned to other genera. \"S. sphenocerus\", described by Edward Drinker Cope in 1890 as a species of \"Monoclonius\" and based on a nasal bone with a broken \"Styracosaurus\"-like straight nose horn, was attributed to \"Styracosaurus\" in 1915. \"S. makeli\", mentioned informally by amateur paleontologists Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas in 1990 in a caption to an illustration, is an early name for \"Einiosaurus\". \"S. borealis\" is an early informal name for \"S. parksi\".\n\nIndividuals of the genus \"Styracosaurus\" were approximately long as adults and weighed around 2.7 tonnes. The skull was massive, with a large nostril, a tall straight nose horn, and a parietosquamosal frill (a neck frill) crowned with at least four large spikes. Each of the four longest frill spines was comparable in length to the nose horn, at long. The nasal horn was estimated by Lambe at long in the type specimen, but the tip had not been preserved. Based on other nasal horn cores from \"Styracosaurus\" and \"Centrosaurus\", this horn may have come to a more rounded point at around half of that length.\n\nAside from the large nasal horn and four long frill spikes, the cranial ornamentation was variable. Some individuals had small hook-like projections and knobs at the posterior margin of the frill, similar to but smaller than those in \"Centrosaurus\". Others had less prominent tabs. Some, like the type individual, had a third pair of long frill spikes. Others had much smaller projections, and small points are found on the side margins of some but not all specimens. Modest pyramid-shaped brow horns were present in subadults, but were replaced by pits in adults. Like most ceratopsids, \"Styracosaurus\" had large fenestrae (skull openings) in its frill. The front of the mouth had a toothless beak.\n\nThe bulky body of \"Styracosaurus\" resembled that of a rhinoceros. It had powerful shoulders which may have been useful in intraspecies combat. \"Styracosaurus\" had a relatively short tail. Each toe bore a hooflike ungual which was sheathed in horn.\n\nVarious limb positions have been proposed for \"Styracosaurus\" and ceratopsids in general, including forelegs which were held underneath the body, or, alternatively, held in a sprawling position. The most recent work has put forward an intermediate crouched position as most likely.\n\n\"Styracosaurus\" is a member of the Centrosaurinae. Other members of the clade include \"Centrosaurus\" (from which the group takes its name), \"Pachyrhinosaurus\", \"Avaceratops\", \"Einiosaurus\", \"Albertaceratops\", \"Achelousaurus\", \"Brachyceratops\", and \"Monoclonius\", although these last two are dubious. Because of the variation between species and even individual specimens of centrosaurines, there has been much debate over which genera and species are valid, particularly whether \"Centrosaurus\" and/or \"Monoclonius\" are valid genera, undiagnosable, or possibly members of the opposite sex. In 1996, Peter Dodson found enough variation between \"Centrosaurus\", \"Styracosaurus\", and \"Monoclonius\" to warrant separate genera, and that \"Styracosaurus\" resembled \"Centrosaurus\" more closely than either resembled \"Monoclonius\". Dodson also believed one species of \"Monoclonius\", \"M. nasicornis\", may actually have been a female \"Styracosaurus\". However, most other researchers have not accepted \"Monoclonius nasicornis\" as a female \"Styracosaurus\", instead regarding it as a synonym of \"Centrosaurus apertus\". While sexual dimorphism has been proposed for an earlier ceratopsian, \"Protoceratops\", there is no firm evidence for sexual dimorphism in any ceratopsid.\nThe cladogram depicted below represents a phylogenetic analysis by Chiba \"et al.\" (2017):\n\nThe evolutionary origins of \"Styracosaurus\" were not understood for many years because fossil evidence for early ceratopsians was sparse. The discovery of \"Protoceratops\", in 1922, shed light on early ceratopsid relationships, but several decades passed before additional finds filled in more of the blanks. Fresh discoveries in the late 1990s and 2000s, including \"Zuniceratops\", the earliest known ceratopsian with brow horns, and \"Yinlong\", the first known Jurassic ceratopsian, indicate what the ancestors of \"Styracosaurus\" may have looked like. These new discoveries have been important in illuminating the origins of horned dinosaurs in general, and suggest that the group originated during the Jurassic in Asia, with the appearance of true horned ceratopsians occurring by the beginning of the late Cretaceous in North America.\n\nGoodwin and colleagues proposed in 1992 that \"Styracosaurus\" was part of the lineage leading to \"Einiosaurus\", \"Achelousaurus\" and \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". This was based on a series of fossil skulls from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana. The position of \"Styracosaurus\" in this lineage is now equivocal, as the remains that were thought to represent \"Styracosaurus\" have been transferred to the genus \"Rubeosaurus\".\n\n\"Styracosaurus\" is known from a higher position in the formation (relating specifically to its own genus) than the closely related \"Centrosaurus\", suggesting that \"Styracosaurus\" displaced \"Centrosaurus\" as the environment changed over time and/or dimension. It has been suggested that \"Styracosaurus albertensis\" is a direct descendant of \"Centrosaurus\" (\"C. apertus\" or \"C. nasicornis\"), and that it in turn evolved directly into the slightly later species \"Rubeosaurus ovatus\". Subtle changes can be traced in the arrangement of the horns through this lineage, leading from \"Rubeosaurus\" to \"Einiosaurus\", to \"Achelousaurus\" and \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". However, the lineage may not be a simple, straight line, as a pachyrhinosaur-like species has been reported from the same time and place as \"Styracosaurus albertensis\".\n\n\"Styracosaurus\" and other horned dinosaurs are often depicted in popular culture as herd animals. A bonebed composed of \"Styracosaurus\" remains is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, about halfway up the formation. This bonebed is associated with different types of river deposits. The mass deaths may have been a result of otherwise non-herding animals congregating around a waterhole in a period of drought, with evidence suggesting the environment may have been seasonal and semiarid.\n\nPaleontologists Gregory Paul and Per Christiansen proposed that large ceratopsians such as \"Styracosaurus\" were able to run faster than an elephant, based on possible ceratopsian trackways which did not exhibit signs of sprawling forelimbs.\n\nStyracosaurs were herbivorous dinosaurs; they probably fed mostly on low growth because of the position of the head. They may, however, have been able to knock down taller plants with their horns, beak, and bulk. The jaws were tipped with a deep, narrow beak, believed to have been better at grasping and plucking than biting.\n\nCeratopsid teeth, including those of \"Styracosaurus\", were arranged in groups called batteries. Older teeth on top were continually replaced by the teeth underneath them. Unlike hadrosaurids, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid teeth sliced but did not grind. Some scientists have suggested that ceratopsids like \"Styracosaurus\" ate palms and cycads, while others have suggested ferns. Dodson has proposed that Late Cretaceous ceratopsians may have knocked down angiosperm trees and then sheared off leaves and twigs.\n\nThe large nasal horns and frills of \"Styracosaurus\" are among the most distinctive facial adornments of all dinosaurs. Their function has been the subject of debate since the first horned dinosaurs were discovered.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, paleontologist R. S. Lull proposed that the frills of ceratopsian dinosaurs acted as anchor points for their jaw muscles. He later noted that for \"Styracosaurus\", the spikes would have given it a formidable appearance. In 1996, Dodson supported the idea of muscle attachments in part and created detailed diagrams of possible muscle attachments in the frills of \"Styracosaurus\" and \"Chasmosaurus\", but did not subscribe to the idea that they completely filled in the fenestrae. C.A. Forster, however, found no evidence of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.\n\nIt was long believed that ceratopsians like \"Styracosaurus\" used their frills and horns in defence against the large predatory dinosaurs of the time. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on ceratopsid skulls are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study found no evidence for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (for example, there is no evidence of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone resorption, or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes.\n\nHowever, a newer study compared incidence rates of skull lesions in \"Triceratops\" and \"Centrosaurus\" and showed that these were consistent with \"Triceratops\" using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a protective structure, while lower pathology rates in \"Centrosaurus\" may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head; as \"Centrosaurus\" was more closely related to \"Styracosaurus\" and both genera had long nasal horns, the results for this genus would be more applicable for \"Styracosaurus\". The researchers also concluded that the damage found on the specimens in the study was often too localized to be caused by bone disease.\n\nThe large frill on \"Styracosaurus\" and related genera also may have helped to increase body area to regulate body temperature, like the ears of the modern elephant. A similar theory has been proposed regarding the plates of \"Stegosaurus\", although this use alone would not account for the bizarre and extravagant variation seen in different members of the Ceratopsidae. This observation is highly suggestive of what is now believed to be the primary function, display.\n\nThe theory of frill use in sexual display was first proposed in 1961 by Davitashvili. This theory has gained increasing acceptance. Evidence that visual display was important, either in courtship or in other social behavior, can be seen in the fact that horned dinosaurs differ markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them in similar behavior.\n\nThe use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists in vast majority of modern species of tetrapods (terrestrial vertebrates). \n\nA skull discovered in 2015 from a \"Styracosaurus\" indicates that individual variation was likely commonplace in the genus. The asymmetrical nature of the horns in the specimen has been compared to deer, which often have asymmetrical antlers in various individuals. The study carried out may also indicate that the genus \"Rubeosaurus\" may be synonymous with \"Styracosaurus\" as a result.\n\n\"Styracosaurus\" is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation, and was a member of a diverse and well-documented fauna of prehistoric animals that included horned relatives such as \"Centrosaurus\" and \"Chasmosaurus\", duckbills such as \"Prosaurolophus\", \"Lambeosaurus\", \"Gryposaurus\", \"Corythosaurus\", and \"Parasaurolophus\", tyrannosaurids \"Gorgosaurus\", \"Daspletosaurus\", and armored \"Edmontonia\" and \"Euoplocephalus\".\n\nThe Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.\n\n"}

He is best known for his roles in all seven \"Police Academy\" films as Larvell Jones. He has also appeared in \"Spaceballs\", \"Cheech and Chong's Next Movie\", \"The Love Boat\", and commercials for Cadbury and GEICO.\n\nWinslow was born in Spokane, Washington, the son of Verdie and Robert Winslow. He attended the Lisa Maile School of Acting, Modeling and Imaging.\n\nWinslow grew up at Fairchild Air Force Base where, according to his own account, he had few friends. To pass time, he would imitate the sounds of engines, animals, anything that made noise. Following his high school and college periods, he performed in nightclubs and theaters, where his sound imitation skills won him positive appraisal and enough money to move to and perform his act in Hollywood.\n\nHis first television appearance was on \"The Gong Show\" in which he squeezed in sound-alikes of Benji the movie dog, \"Star Trek\", and Jimi Hendrix's \"Purple Haze\". He is best known for his role as Sgt. Larvelle \"Motor Mouth\" Jones in the \"Police Academy\" series of movies and TV shows. In 1985, Island Records released a 12\" of Michael Winslow entitled \"I Am My Own Walkman\". \n\nIn 1986, Winslow presented the Best Sound Effects Editing Oscar to Charles L. Campbell and Robert Rutledge for their work on \"Back to the Future\".\n\nIn 1987, Winslow appeared as a radar operator in the movie \"Spaceballs\", in which he performs all the sound effects during his scene himself. Mel Brooks (who wrote, directed, produced, and co-starred in the film), stated that by doing so, Winslow saved the film money. Winslow is also a motivational speaker. Since the fall of 2008, Winslow has hosted the motion-picture television series called \"Way Back Wednesday with Winslow\" on the cable superstation WGN America, which features movies mostly released in the 1980s. He continues to perform stand-up comedy around the globe.\n\nMichael Winslow debuted his own iPhone and iPod Touch apps in 2010, bringing his sound effects and comedy to a mobile platform. ThatsKungFu generates Winslow's kung fu fighting sounds when the device is swung in a fighting motion. NoizeyMan, billed as the \"World's Noiziest App\", contains video, ringtones, sound effects, and mini games, all created by Winslow.\n\nIn 2011, Winslow worked with Orlando, Florida-based game development studio Phyken Media on a mobile game for iOS and Android platforms entitled \"Wizard Ops Chapter 1\", providing all the sound effects for the game. He also lent his voice on \"Wizard Ops Tactics\", a turn-based tactical game and spiritual successor to the previous game.\n\nHe was also featured in a commercial for GEICO Insurance during their \"we hired a celebrity\" ad campaign.\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 20, 1998. After Homer prevents Mayor Quimby and Mark Hamill from being trampled at a convention, Homer trains to become a bodyguard and is employed by Quimby. After Homer discovers Quimby has been making corrupt deals with Fat Tony and forces him to end the deal, Fat Tony threatens to kill Quimby, leaving Homer to defend the Mayor from threats. The episode was written by Ron Hauge and directed by Swinton O. Scott III, and received positive reviews from critics overall.\n\nWhile watching television, the Simpson family sees a commercial for the \"Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con\", a science-fiction convention featuring Mark Hamill and others, and decide to attend. A riot breaks out at the convention after Hamill offers the chance for someone in the crowd to act out a scene with him. Homer notices that Mark Hamill and Mayor Quimby are in danger of being trampled due to the riot and quickly rescues them. In gratitude, Quimby employs Homer as his bodyguard.\n\nHomer begins training at \"Leavelle's Bodyguard Academy,\" where he quickly graduates and begins his new job. Unbeknownst to Homer, Quimby made a deal with Fat Tony shortly after Homer was employed to provide milk to the schools of Springfield. Homer discovers the milk is from rats and confronts Quimby, accidentally knocking him out a window. Discovering Quimby hanging from a ledge, Homer makes him promise to expose Fat Tony in return for being pulled to safety.\n\nQuimby organizes the arrests of Fat Tony and his men, but Fat Tony threatens Quimby's life. Scared at having to defend Quimby due to the death threats, Homer attempts to reassure the Mayor by taking him to a dinner theater to see Mark Hamill portray Nathan Detroit in \"Guys and Dolls\". Homer discovers Fat Tony is there alongside his henchman, Louie, having been released on bail, and unwittingly made the situation worse when he did what Fat Tony told him to do by planting a kiss on Mayor Quimby, oblivious to the fact that he had given the Mayor the kiss of death. Louie attempts to stab Quimby but is stopped in a scuffle with Homer after Hamill advises Homer to \"use the forks.\" However, Fat Tony is still able to savagely beat Quimby with a baseball bat. Hamill says to Homer that Quimby will be fine, and Homer helps Hamill escape from the paparazzi.\n\nRon Hauge, writer of the episode, wanted to do an episode where he would use Homer's qualities such as oafishness, brute strength, thickness, and loyalty, for good. When Lisa says they have to go back for Maggie after the family escape the riot, Homer says \"Forget Maggie, she's gone.\" Matt Groening claims this to be one of his favorite quotes in the show. Hamill only agreed to guest star if he was allowed to voice a character as well as himself. He stated that he loved doing the voice for bodyguard instructor Leavelle a lot more than he did providing the voice for himself.\n\nThe Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con science-fiction convention features numerous references to the genre. As well as Mark Hamill, guests at the convention include ALF from the television series \"ALF\", Tom Baker in costume as the Fourth Doctor from the series \"Doctor Who\", Gort from the film \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (1951), Godzilla from the film series of the same name and Jonathan Harris in costume as Dr. Zachary Smith from the series \"Lost in Space\" TV show, as well as the robot from the show. Real-life astronaut Neil Armstrong is also a guest.\n\nAmong the attendees is Üter, who wears a \"Futurama\" shirt; \"Futurama\", an animated science-fiction comedy which was created by \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening, did not premiere until the following year. Seymour Skinner is dressed as Spock from \"Star Trek\", as are several others, and Edna Krabappel is dressed as Barbarella from the comic and film \"Barbarella\" (1968). Other costumes include Xena from the series \"\", Terminator from \"The Terminator\" film series, Griffin from the novel \"The Invisible Man\" (1897) and later the comic book series \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\", as well as a Borg and Geordi La Forge from \"Star Trek\". When Comic Book Guy meets a girl with similar interests to him at the convention, Alexander Courage's piece \"Under the Spell\" from the original \"Star Trek\" pilot \"\" is played. A booth for the comic book \"Roswell, Little Green Man\" is seen at the convention; the comic was published by Groening's Bongo Comics Group.\n\nThe episode contains multiple references to \"Star Wars\", the film series in which Hamill starred. Throughout the episode, Hamill wears the costume of his \"Star Wars\" character Luke Skywalker, and tells Homer to \"use the forks,\" spoofing the line \"use the Force \" from the series. The convention features a tag-team wrestling match which sees \"the mighty robots\" (the Cylons) from the series \"Battlestar Galactica\" fight the \"gay robots\" (R2-D2 and C-3PO) from \"Star Wars\". Somebody at the convention wears a costume of the \"Star Wars\" character Chewbacca. Homer and Mayor Quimby attend a production of the musical \"Guys and Dolls\" (1955), starring Hamill as Nathan Detroit, who sings the \"Star Wars\"-themed \"Luke, Be a Jedi Tonight\" to the tune of \"Luck Be a Lady\".\n\nLeavelle's design is based on Texan detective Jim Leavelle, as he appeared when escorting Lee Harvey Oswald when Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby. Leavelle trains the bodyguards by pretending to shoot their protectee from a grassy knoll on a cart. This is a reference to the grassy knoll at the site of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Dealey Plaza and a scene from the Kennedy assassination film \"Executive Action\" (1973).\n\nThe plot shares elements with the film \"The Bodyguard\" (1992), particularly Homer carrying Hamill away from the crowd at the end. Leavelle sings the song \"I Will Always Love You\" by Dolly Parton which was popularized by Whitney Houston as the theme for \"The Bodyguard\"; it also plays at the end. After believing he has killed Mayor Quimby, Homer decides to take inspiration from the film \"Weekend at Bernie's\" (1989) and \"use the body to stage an elaborate farce.\" The title of the episode is a reference to the film \"Married to the Mob\" (1988). During the \"Guys and Dolls\" scene the cast members sing a song with the musical's title to the tune of \"Hooray for Hollywood\", which as Mark Hamill points out isn't one of the show's musical numbers.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Mayored to the Mob\" finished 24th in ratings for the week of December 14–20, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 8.6, equivalent to approximately 8.5 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"Ally McBeal\".\n\n\"Empire\" named Hamill's performance in the episode as the tenth-best film gag in the show, commenting: \"As a rule, celebrity cameos are rubbish, but good sport Hamill is hilarious when singing 'Luke, be a Jedi tonight' in a production of \"Guys and Dolls\", and makes this list for urging bodyguard Homer to 'use the forks.'\" Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson and Brian Zoromski of IGN marked Hamill's guest appearance second on a list of \"Top 25 \"Simpsons\" Guest appearances\" saying that much of the episode's humor came from Hamill being \"a good sport about his past\". In addition, Hamill ranked 18th on AOL's list of their favorite 25 \"Simpsons\" guest stars, and \"Total Film\"'s Nathan Ditum ranked his performance as the third-best guest appearance in the show's history. Simon Crerar of \"The Times\" also listed Hamill's performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of \"The Simpsons\".\n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that \"the best bits all involve either the convention or Mark Hamill's repeated attempts to not be mobbed. Sadly, the main thrust of the story – Homer's protection of Quimby from Don Tony – falls a bit flat. Nevertheless, when the jokes run free, they are of exceptionally high quality.\" In his review of \"The Simpsons\"' tenth season, James Plath of Dvdtown.com notes \"Mayored to the Mob\" to be \"one of the funnier episodes.\" IGN named it as the best episode of season 10. In an interview with Australian newspaper \"mX\", season 10 show runner Mike Scully marked \"Mayored to the Mob\" as fourth in his top-five episodes from season 10. Screen Rant called it the best episode of the 10th season.\n\n"}

The show, designed to introduce viewers to the basics of Spanish, had two seasons, beginning in 1992. Its 52 episodes are often used for educational purposes in schools and are still broadcast regularly on many PBS stations, as well as many local channels.\n\n\"Destinos\" was produced by WGBH Boston and funded by the Annenberg/CPB Project, with additional funding by the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation.\n\n\"Destinos\" uses the \"telenovela\" (Spanish soap opera) format to teach Spanish-language communication and comprehension skills. Early episodes have English-language narration in addition to the Spanish-language dialogue, but the English language content decreases continually, eventually disappearing entirely. The viewer is introduced to various accents and dialects and the cultures of various Spanish-speaking countries.\n\nThe series consists of 52 videos that cover virtually the entire scope of Spanish grammar, including verb tenses of present, future (including future of uncertainty), imperfect, preterite, perfect, pluperfect, participles, and the present, imperfect, and perfect forms of the subjunctive. It also covers a variety of country-specific usages: for example, it uses both the verb \"extrañar\" (to miss somebody or something) and the phrase \"echar de menos\" (which means the same thing). After the early episodes, the conversation is done at more or less normal speaking speed, improving the student's comprehension. Spanish subtitles are included on both VHS and DVD versions — translations are not provided. The DVDs are available from the Annenberg/CPB project website.\n\nAn accompanying set of materials is available to complement the series. These include a set of audio tapes and textbook, the latter of which follows the series episode-for-episode but provides a more systematic presentation such as would be used in a classroom course.\n\n\"Destinos\" is also characterized by frequent reviews of preceding episodes. This characteristic may make the series seem to be overly long and excessive, but there is a purpose to the reviews: it provides extensive repetition, which helps many people learn the material.\n\n\nEducational material has been released to accompany the episodes. The first episode refers to these as one textbook, two workbooks and audiocassettes. Additional material has been produced since the release of the series.\n\n\n\"Destinos\" recounts the story of Los Angeles-based lawyer Raquel Rodríguez who is hired by the family of Fernando Castillo (Augusto Benedico). He had discovered that his first wife, Rosario, did not die in the Spanish Civil War as he had believed, but had survived and had an unknown child. In the course of her investigation of the case, Raquel travels to a number of Spanish-speaking areas — Seville and Madrid, Spain; Buenos Aires, Argentina; San Juan and San Germán, Puerto Rico; and Mexico — has a number of adventures and mishaps, meets a love interest (Arturo Puig) and faces a number of melodramatic conflicts.\n\nRecurring plot elements include Raquel traveling in pursuit of the investigation, letters (primarily to determine last known addresses of people), comic mix-ups, and death (although nobody dies during the series, many characters are found to have died and Don Fernando is on the verge of dying).\n\nThe Beginning: In a large estate called La Gavia outside Mexico City, a very old Don Fernando has been keeping a secret for some time: he received a letter, from one Señora Teresa Suárez of Seville, Spain, stating that his first wife, Rosario, did not die in the Spanish Civil War as he had thought.\n\nFernando's (unspecified) medical problems are increasing, however, and when he starts seeing hallucinations of Rosario he finally decides to act. He gathers his entire extended family, which includes the families of his children, Juan, Carlos, Ramon, and Mercedes, together and explains to them that he wants to find out what happened to Rosario, who was pregnant when they lost contact. His brother Pedro hires Raquel, a lawyer of his acquaintance, to investigate.\n\nSpain Arc: Raquel first travels to Seville to meet Sra. Suárez. She meets and spends time with family members, son Miguel, and Sra. Suarez' grandson Jaime, and soon learns from them that Sra. Suárez has since moved to Madrid and won't talk by telephone. Raquel travels to Madrid; after a comic mix-up of identities and hotel rooms, where she is thought to be the winner of the Spanish lottery, she then meets Sra. Suárez's son and is taken to see her. She learns that Rosario has moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina and is given the address from Rosario's last letter. She also learns that Rosario had likewise thought Fernando had died in the war and that Rosario and Fernando have a son named Angel. In parting, Sra. Suárez's last words to Raquel prove prophetic: \"Life is not all work: you also need to dedicate some time to your heart!\"\n\nArgentina Arc: Raquel then travels to Argentina to search for Rosario. When she finds that Rosario no longer lives at the address on the letter Sra. Suárez gave her (the Estancia Santa Susana, a real tourist ranch near Buenos Aires), she follows a lead from a local gaucho, happens upon the office of psychiatrist Dr. Arturo Iglesias, and soon finds out he is Angel's half-brother and a son of Rosario. Arturo takes Raquel to the family crypt, and there, Raquel discovers that Rosario had actually died. For years, Arturo has been estranged from Angel, whom he blamed for his father's deadly heart attack. Arturo and Raquel begin a long search for acquaintances of Angel in his last known location, an Italian seaport neighborhood of Buenos Aires called La Boca. Armed only with a picture of a 20-year-old Angel, they eventually find an outgoing old sailor named Héctor Condotti, who remembers his good friend Angel. After several days, during which Raquel and Arturo start to develop a romance, Héctor produces a letter with Angel's address in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nPuerto Rico Arc: Raquel then flies to San Juan and goes to the address in Old San Juan. From a neighbor, Raquel finds out that Angel died only a few months ago and had a wife who died several years before. While photographing the grave of Angel, Raquel runs into Angel's daughter, Angela. She tells Angela the whole story, including that she has a grandfather in Mexico and an uncle in Argentina she has never heard of. Raquel also finds out that Angela has a brother, Roberto, living in Mexico. Angela's stern aunt Olga does not want her to travel to Mexico with Raquel, but after a trip to see her grandmother in San Germán, her grandmother gives her blessing to travel. Along the two-hour trip to San Germán, they have car trouble and must stay overnight in Ponce.\n\nFinally, we meet Angela's boyfriend and nauseating \"mujeriego\" (\"womanizer\"), Jorge. He makes several clumsy passes at Raquel. A mild fight between Raquel and Angela ensues; not because Raquel tells Angela about the passes (she decides not to based on advice from her mother), but because Angela thinks the world of him and wants to give him a significant amount of money to start a theater. Nonetheless, Raquel and Angela are about to travel together to Mexico when they learn that Angela's brother Roberto has been trapped in an archaeological excavation in Mexico.\n\nMexico/Rescuing Roberto Arc: Raquel and Angela travel to Mexico, where they quickly drive to a small town where Roberto is trapped in a pre-Columbian excavation. Arturo was to meet them in Mexico City, but they cannot get in contact with him, so he spends several days in Mexico City wondering what happened to them, while they stay at a local church. Several episodes (possibly the slowest in the series) pass where Raquel and Angela are waiting for Roberto to be rescued and Arturo is wondering what happened to Raquel. Finally, Roberto is rescued and Angela and Roberto meet their uncle Arturo.\n\nLove Triangle Arc: After Raquel calls her mother back in Los Angeles to catch up, her mother hatches a scheme to get Raquel back together with Luis, an old boyfriend. Luis called and talked to Raquel's mother and began trying to get back into Raquel's life. Luis impressed Raquel's mother with his apparent maturity and wealth, so, despite her advice to Raquel not to get mixed up in other people's lives, and despite her husband's misgivings, she invites Luis down to Mexico unbeknownst to Raquel. Arturo and Luis meet, resulting in some tense moments, but they generally get along well, leaving Raquel wondering what is happening.\n\nFinally, Arturo meets Raquel's parents. Arturo finds Raquel's father is amiable but her mother is clearly not. Raquel had by now figured out that her mother asked Luis to come down to Mexico, and a fight between the two ensues. Her mother finally admits that the only reason she's opposed to Arturo is that she's afraid that Raquel, their only daughter, will move to Argentina with Arturo. After Raquel assures her she will not leave her parents alone, her mother has a change of heart. When Luis presents Raquel with tickets to go away for a romantic weekend with him, she tells him that there is no chance. Luis leaves a good-bye note for Raquel and returns to the United States.\n\nFamily Problems Arc: Meanwhile, after Don Fernando is transported to Guadalajara to see a medical specialist, a financial irregularity comes to light. Don Fernando's son Carlos has been embezzling money from the family company's office in Miami. It turns out that his wife, Gloria, is a gambling addict and Carlos took the money to bail her out. The whole family company (including the La Gavia ranch) is endangered. Because of this, they close the Miami office and consider selling the ranch. Another monetary difficulty arises, this time between Angela and Roberto, over the fact that she wants to give her part of the money from the sale of their father's home to her Jorge. Avuncular Arturo starts playing mediator and tries to talk them through the situation.\n\nDoubts (Review Arc): Finally, they all meet Don Fernando. It is a happy meeting, though Fernando is near death, so when Don Fernando suddenly walks in on their reunion dinner fully dressed and looking quite a bit stronger, they are all confused. To their amazement, Don Fernando tells them that he doubts their story: he does not believe that Arturo is really his step-son and Angela and Roberto are really his grandchildren. This device gives Raquel an opportunity to review the entire series, which takes four episodes.\n\nAt Long Last (Final Arc): At last, Don Fernando is convinced, not just because of Raquel's recounting and documentation, but because Angela produces a matching wedding cup that was passed from Rosario to Angel, to Angela's grandmother, to Angela. Another plot element is tied up when it turns out that Don Fernando has been squirreling away money all along, with the intention of turning the family ranch into an orphanage after his death. Carlos loves kids, having taken care of their kids while Gloria was out gambling, so they name Carlos the leader of the new orphanage.\n\nFinale: To wrap up the series, Arturo expresses his interest to move to Los Angeles to be with Raquel, since he has no family and few friends in Argentina.\n\n\nA follow-up story, \"Nuevos Destinos\" was produced by WGBH and McGraw-Hill for Annenberg in 1997. It revisits the \"Destinos\" story six years later as Raquel encounters a new family mystery. The episodes are only 15 minutes long in this sequel, and some major characters from the earlier series, such as Arturo, do not appear outside of flashbacks but may be mentioned or play a role behind the scenes. \"Nuevos Destinos\" includes about three hours of video, with an accompanying immersive CD-ROM that allows the user to help Raquel discover what is going on.\n\nA French-language version of \"Destinos\" was produced as \"Destinos: Une introduction à l'espagnol\", wherein the English-language narration was removed and replaced by French-language narration. This version was broadcast on Télé-Québec, in Quebec, Canada from 1997 to 2001.\n\n\n\n"}
