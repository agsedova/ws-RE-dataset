The tract is administered by the People's Republic of China as part of its Taxkorgan County in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, but it was regarded by Pakistan as part of Kashmir until the 1963 Sino-Pakistan Agreement. It is claimed by India as part of the union territory of Ladakh.\n\nMost of the tract is composed of the Shaksgam Valley and was formerly administered as part of Shigar, a district (formerly a tehsil) in the Baltistan region. A polo ground in Shaksgam was built by the Amacha Royal family of Shigar, and the Rajas of Shigar used to invite the Amirs of Hotan to play polo there. Most of the names of the mountains, lakes, rivers and passes are in Balti/Ladakhi, suggesting that this land had been part of Baltistan/Ladakh region for a long time.\n\nThe tract is one of the most inhospitable areas of the world, with some of the highest mountains. Bounded by the Kun Lun Mountains in the north, and the Karakoram peaks to the south, including Broad Peak, K2 and Gasherbrum, on the southeast it is adjacent to the highest battlefield in the world on the Siachen Glacier region which is controlled by India.\n\nHistorically the people of Hunza cultivated and grazed areas to the north of the Karakoram, and the Mir of Hunza claimed those areas as part of Hunza's territories. Those areas included the Raskam Valley, north of the Shaksgam Valley.\n\nIn 1889 the first expedition to the Shaksgam Valley by a European was undertaken by Francis Younghusband (who referred to the Shaksgam as the Oprang).\n\nIn March 1899 the British proposed, in a formal Note from Sir Claude MacDonald to China, a new boundary between China and British India. The Note proposed that China should relinquish its claims to suzerainty over Hunza, and in return Hunza should relinquish its claims to most of the Taghdumbash and Raskam districts. The Note proposed a border which broadly followed the main Karakoram crest dividing the watersheds of the Indus River and the Tarim River, but with a variation to pass through a Hunza post at Darwaza near the Shimshal Pass. The Chinese did not respond to the Note and the Indian government never revisited the boundary in the same form again. The MacDonald line was modified in 1905 to include in India a small area east of the Shimshal Pass, to put the border on a stretch of the Shaksgam River.\n\nAt the same time, in view of \"The Great Game\", Britain was concerned at the danger of Russian expansion as Qing dynasty China weakened and so adopted a policy of claiming a border north of the Shaksgam River. This followed a line proposed by Sir John Ardagh in a Memorandum of 1897. That border included the Mir of Hunza's claim over the Raskam Valley. However, British administration never extended north of the Karakoram watershed.\n\nFrom 1899 until the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, the representation of the border on maps varied. In 1926 Kenneth Mason explored and surveyed the Shaksgam Valley.\nIn 1927 the Government of British India abandoned any claim to the area north of the MacDonald line, but the decision did not find its way on to British maps. By 1959, however, Chinese maps were published showing large areas west and south of the MacDonald line in China. That year, the Government of Pakistan announced its willingness to consult on the boundary question.\n\nSince 1947, India claims sovereignty over the entire area of the pre-1947 independent state of Jammu and Kashmir and maintains that Pakistan and China do not share a common border.\n\nThe Government of Pakistan had published an official map depicting the alignment of the northern Border of Kashmir in 1962 which depicted much of the Cis-Kuen Lun Tract as part of Kashmir and the alignment published by the Government of Pakistan predominantly was similar to and coincided with the portrayal of the northern Border of Kashmir in 1954 by the \"Times Atlas\" which had predominantly depicted the Cis-Kuen Lun Tract as a part of Kashmir under the caption \"Undefined Frontier area\" though at places, the official position of the Government of Pakistan deviated from the position of the Times Atlas, and the Government of Pakistan even depicted areas as part of Kashmir which were to the north of the border of Kashmir as published in 1954 by the Times Atlas. The northern border published by the \"Times Atlas\" in 1954 more or less followed the principle of watershed of the Kuen Lun range from the Taghdumbash Pamir to the Yangi Dawan pass north of Kulanaldi but east of the Yangi Dawan Pass, the border deviated from the principle of the watershed of the Kuen Lun range on the edge of the highlands of Kashmir and skipped from the Kuen Lun watershed rather than continuing on the Kilian, Sanju-la and Hindutash border passes despite the statement that “The eastern (Kuenlun) range forms the southern boundary of Khotan”, in the 1890 Gazetteer of Kashmir and Ladak and is crossed by two other passes. The Gazetteer of Kashmír and Ladák compiled under the direction of the Quarter Master General in India in the Intelligence Branch and first Published in 1890 gives a description and details of places inside Kashmir and thus includes a description of the Híñdutásh Pass in north eastern Kashmir in the Aksai Chin area in Kashmir . The aforesaid Gazetteer states in pages 520 and 364 that “The eastern (Kuenlun) range forms the southern boundary of Khotan”, “and is crossed by two passes, the Yangi or Elchi Diwan, ... and the Hindutak (i.e. Híñdutásh ) Díwán”. It describes Khotan as “ A province of the Chinese Empire lying to the north of the Eastern Kuenlun range, which here forms the boundary of Ladák”. Thus the official position of the Government of Pakistan prior to the 1963 Sino-Pakistan Agreement was that the northern border of Pakistan was on the Kuen Lun range and the territory ceded by the Government of Pakistan was not just restricted to the Shaksgam Valley but extended to the Kuen Lun range. For an idea of the extent of the Trans-Karakoram Tract or the Cis-Kuen Lun Tract, a view the map (C) from the Joe Schwartzberg's Historical Atlas of South Asia at DSAL in Chicago with the caption, \"The boundary of Kashmir with China as portrayed and proposed by Britain prior to 1947\" would show that the geographical and territorial extent of the Trans-Karakoram Tract or the Cis-Kuen Lun Tract is more or less the territory enclosed between the northern most line and the innermost lines.\n\nIn 1959 the Pakistani government became concerned over Chinese maps that showed areas the Pakistanis considered their own as part of China. In 1961 Ayub Khan sent a formal note to China; there was no reply. It is thought that the Chinese might not have been motivated to negotiate with Pakistan because of Pakistan's relations with India.\nThe agreement resulted in the surrendering of of territory. In the opinion of Jawaharlal Nehru, \"According to the survey of Pakistan maps, even those published in 1962, about of Sinkiang territory formed part of Kashmir. If one goes by these maps, Pakistan has obviously surrendered over of territory\".\nAfter Pakistan voted to grant China a seat in the United Nations, the Chinese withdrew the disputed maps in January 1962, agreeing to enter border talks in March. Negotiations between the nations officially began on October 13, 1962 and resulted in the Sino-Pakistan Agreement signed on 2 March 1963 by foreign ministers Chen Yi of China and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan.\n\n\n\n"}

It has won several prizes, notably at beer competitions in the United States, and is New Zealand's biggest export beer.\n\nIn 1957 the New Zealand Minister of Finance, Arnold Nordmeyer, threatened to cut international beer imports as part of his \"black budget\" and challenged New Zealand's brewers to \"come up with an international-style lager beer\". Lion (then New Zealand Breweries) produced a beer the following year named Steinecker, named after the company whose equipment the beer was made in. The beer's name was changed in 1962, not in response to a challenge from the Steinecker company, but to distinguish it from Heineken.\n\nIn 1973 Steinlager was launched in the United States and an American consultant suggested that to become successful the company should change the colour of their bottles to match that of other premium beers. As a result, the original brown bottle colour was changed to green.\n\nIn 1991, another beer bearing the Steinlager name was introduced. Steinlager Blue was marketed using an advertising campaign featuring The Blues Brothers. The two different tasting beers were known as Steinlager Blue or Steinlager Green which related to the colour of the bottle or can it came in (although Steinlager Blue was sold in a brown bottle). Steinlager Blue was discontinued in the later 1990s, leaving just Steinlager Green which then dropped the green from the name. Note the only reason Steinlager Blue & Green tasted different was the bottle colour. Beers bottled in green or clear bottles degrade under UV light. Both Steinlager beers were brewed in the same vat.\n\nOn the first of June 2007 Steinlager Pure was released in the New Zealand market. Steinlager \"Pure\" and Steinlager \"Classic\" are now sold alongside each other, with Steinlager Pure positioning itself at the premium end of the beer market. It is marketed with Harvey Keitel, Willem Dafoe and Vincent Gallo.\n\nIntroduced in 2000 as a low alcohol variant of Steinlager.\n\nIntroduced in 2006, Super Cold is simply Steinlager Classic served at 0 degrees Celsius.\n\nSteinlager Edge was a mid-strength, low-carb variant of Steinlager. It is made from the same hops as Classic and Pure but has an alcohol content of just 3.5% compared to 5.0%. It was discontinued in 2013 due to poor sales.\n\nSteinlager is actively involved in sponsorship of major New Zealand sports teams, probably the most high-profile rugby team in the world, the New Zealand All Blacks Rugby Union team, have had the support of Steinlager since 1986. Steinlager is also the current presenting sponsor of the United States leg of the IRB Sevens World Series.\n\nSteinlager was involved in yacht racing with the maxi-ketch \"Steinlager 2\", which was skippered by Peter Blake, won all six legs of the 1989–90 Whitbread Round the World Race, and again in 1995 with Team New Zealand with their \"Black Magic\" boat, which won the Americas Cup by beating Dennis Conner's defending boat Stars & Stripes, also known as Young America, 5-nil in the finals' series. Steinlager, along with Toyota, ENZA, TVNZ and Telecom New Zealand, formed the \"family of five\" major sponsors of Team New Zealand in 1995 and again in their successful defence of the cup in 2000.\n\nIn 2006, Steinlager provided sponsorship to specific USA Rugby Union teams, including Media Rugby Football Club and York/Lancaster Rugby Football Club, as part of a US marketing campaign.\n\n\n"}

The town is in the Greater Hume Shire local government area and on the Main South railway line between Sydney and Melbourne, where it intersects with the Olympic Highway. Gerogery serves a rural farming community. Gerogery has a temperate climate. It lies close to the Great Yambla Range, with its striking Tabletop and Sugar Loaf ridge at the southern end.\n\nAt the 2006 census, Gerogery had a population of 979.\n\nGerogery is on land originally inhabited by the Wiradjuri people. In English, the place name is pronounced Jer-rodge-er-rree; however, in Indigenous language it could have been a repeated \"Jerro-Jerro ee\". Local understanding is the place is named after the Wiradjuri word for magpies, plentiful in the locality.\n\nThe arrival of European settlers meant that trees were extensively cleared and wheat planted, along with sheep and cattle grazed. Gerogery was at the eastern-most extent of nineteenth-century German immigration up the Murray River from South Australia.\n\nDuring the 1860s bushranger Mad Dan Morgan held up Sam Watson at Gerogery East. His hideout, \"Morgan's Place\" is located in the Yambla Range, and was used in between holdups around Tumbarumba, Kyeamba, and as a place to take refuge after the alleged killing of several police and a Wagga Wagga judge. (The bushranger was subject of a Dennis Hopper film Mad Dog Morgan.)\n\nGerogery Post Office opened on 15 April 1875.\n\nThe coming of the Sydney Great Southern Railway in 1880 made Gerogery the temporary terminus while building proceeded on to Albury. This railway resulted in moving the centre of population from an original settlement (now Gerogery West) to the railway line. The station master's residence is a beautiful two-story house listed by the National Trust. The original station was removed in the 1980s. A one-teacher government school was set up close to the railway line in 1884, as part of the general plan by the New South Wales government to stem the spread of religious-based education that was springing up for the poor of the colony.\n\nNot far from Gerogery on the way to Walla Walla is a peak of rocks which was used as a meeting place and lookout to help break the shearers' strike of 1891.\n\nThe Gerogery Commemoration Hall was built in the 1920s. Many concerts and gatherings, including for the monthly Country Women's Association branch, have met here.\n\nBeing from Albury, and on a stock route, the Gerogery Pub attracted Sunday clientele from Albury, who were able to use a statutory loophole to evade Sunday closing and order an alcoholic drink.\n\nProsperity brought by the Korean War wool boom saw the expansion of Gerogery township in the 1950s, with a few general stores, but this had contracted to just one combined post office store by the late 1960s. In 1974 the area was included in the area to be developed as part of a proposed greater Albury-Wodonga region, proposed by the Whitlam Government as part of its national decentralisation program, but these plans were dismantled by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam's successor, Malcolm Fraser. By the end of the twentieth century increased use of the car meant that Gerogery had become a dormitory suburb of Albury.\n\nIn the 1960s Aboriginal stone tools were found a couple of kilometres north-west of the township.\n\nIn 2013 Al Jeda Arabians made Gerogery their homebase.\n\nGerogery West (the original township) is home to the Kimberley Park Welsh Pony Stud.\n\nGerogery has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nThe railway has a crossing loop at Gerogery. Under the AusLink plan, the line between Gerogery and the next crossing loop to the south, Tabletop, will be duplicated. The duplicated line will be about long and will allow for running crosses, where trains in opposing directions need not slow down or stop, and where flights of trains can also pass each other. Due to cost-saving measures, the length of the passing lanes have been reduced to approximately .\n\nIn 2001, there was a fatal accident at a level crossing on the railway line along Bells Road on the Olympic Highway. As a result, the level crossing has been replaced by the \"Five Mates Bridge\".\n\nThe architecture of the station master's house, the Gerogery Pub, and Commemoration Hall, are worthy of note. The Gerogery Doll Museum is also an attraction.\n\nOn 17 December 2009, a fire began at the smouldering Walla Walla rubbish tip, and spread in high winds (estimated to be ) across farm land between Glenellen and Gerogery. It took less than an hour to travel , burning out an estimated . The Rural Fire Service reported sheds, crops, cars and four dwellings were destroyed; the tennis courts were burned down, part of the Olympic Highway was closed, and the Benambra Range was under threat. At least 50 fire trucks were deployed in the Gerogery area.\n\nThe Greater Hume Shire Council provided $200,000 to help landowners replace approximately of boundary fences and help in the removal of fallen tree debris.\n\nwww.aljeda-arabians.com\n"}

He was beaten, handcuffed, tortured, and taken to a pit in the countryside. There he was killed with two shots to the head. His body was placed inside a vehicle rented by \"Noticias\", and burned.\n\nThe murder occurred during the provincial government of Eduardo Duhalde in the Province of Buenos Aires, and was seen as a possible criminal message from the police in the province of Buenos Aires area to its management, \"They threw a corpse at me\" said shortly after the event the President Carlos Saul Menem, who had promised to clarify the case, but there was strong criticism of him by the way the research was carried out and because of his close links with Alfredo Yabrán himself.\n\nIt also happened just as the press in Argentina enjoyed the best public image. \"Noticias\" was and is still known for its exposures of allegedly corrupt individuals and institutions. The murder of Cabezas was viewed as an attack on independent journalism by those institutions. The media, journalist associations, human rights groups and many lay people took to the streets to ask for swift justice; there were marches, caravans of vehicles and trains, public rallies, all sorts of homages, photo expositions. A popular slogan, \"No se olviden de Cabezas\" (\"Don't forget Cabezas\") became the symbol for this need of justice and a warning for those unaware of the people's frustration with impunity.\nThe investigation led, on the one hand, to the detention of five people linked to the owner of a brothel at Mar del Plata's port (they were known as \"Los Pepitos\"). On the other hand, a police informant called Carlos Redruello, a police officer called Gustavo Prellezo and four minors from the Los Hornos area (\"Los Horneros\") were taken in custody. In each case the public largely believed that these people were being used as scapegoats, in order to cover up maneuvers by Buenos Aires Province Governor Eduardo Duhalde. Prellezo was linked to two other policemen, Sergio Cammarata and Aníbal Luna, who had been shadowing Cabezas, and were also detained. Prellezo's wife, Silvia Belawsky (also a police officer), was revealed to have requested background information on Cabezas a few weeks before the crime.\n\nTwo distinct lines of investigation took shape. One focused on Buenos Aires Provincial Police (\"Policía Bonaerense\"); the other on one of the prominent businessman Alfredo Yabrán.\n\n\"Noticias\" published an investigation about the, alleging that Buenos Aires police's practices were plagued with corruption and illegal violence, and that they had ties to prostitution, drug trafficking, and illegal gambling. The title of this article, \"Maldita Policía\" (\"Damned Police\"), became the nickname of the Police service in the media.\n\nAlfredo Yabrán allowed no one to take photos of him, and was proud to claim that not even the intelligence services had one, even though he was one of the most notorious businessmen on Argentina. He had good relations with the government and a way to eliminate competition. Several journalists who had tried to get into Yabrán's secrets had been threatened or attacked.\n\nIn 1996, José Luis Cabezas took a picture of Yabrán in Pinamar and \"Noticias\" published it, along with news about his businesses.

The symbols were normally written using a razor on wood, but painting on boats and beach sheds was also a common practice.\n\nThe purpose of the siglas was to record history and thus they have been ascribed as comprising Póvoa's \"writing system\". However, the siglas do not record sounds or specific words, and so are not considered true writing. The reason for their prominence has been ascertained to be due to a common ignorance of the Latin alphabet among the local population.\n\nLixa Filgueiras argued that there are two types of symbols, distinguished by their use: the marcas (marks) and siglas. The marks served as a way to register ownership and thus were commonly present. The siglas, on the other hand, were used for magical and religious concerns. The siglas, being symbols of a mythical character, were thus rarer both in their ancient and newer forms.\n\nSiglas poveiras have been used for family coat-of-arms since time immemoral by Póvoa de Varzim community. Using these symbols, personal and fishing belongings were distinctly marked and thus a form of property registration. The \"marca-brasão\" (\"blazon-mark\") of a family was known within the entire Póvoa de Varzim community and children were recognized by counting the number of \"piques\" (similar to a traces) within their marks.\n\nThe usefulness of this system is noticed by its usage amongst merchants in their books of credit, and the siglas were read as we today read a name written in the Latin alphabet. Currency values were symbolized by rings and traces, drawn after the mark of an individual.\n\nNevertheless, it was on the tombs of the dead that the marks acquired a sense of personal significance. It became common and accepted to have one's mark carved onto one's tombstone.\n\nAccording to a former port authority of Leixões, the Count of Vilas Boas, an individual stole a compass in Póvoa de Varzim and tried to sell it in Matosinhos, but he was unaware that the recorded \"drawings\" in the cover indicated the owner's name and thus the first person whom he approached (a woman from Póvoa de Varzim) managed to recognize the mark immediately. Summoning other fishermen, who also recognized the mark, the thief was apprehended and submitted to the port authority.\n\nThe siglas are hereditary emblems (much like tamgas or \"Hausmarken\"), transmitted by inheritance from fathers to sons. These have unique symbolism and only the heirs are allowed to use them.\n\nThe siglas were not simply invented, but passed on through generations. The base family sigla was passed from the father to the youngest son — in Póvoa de Varzim’s tradition, the heir of the family is the youngest son — while the other children received the sigla with a trace (the \"pique\"). Thus, the eldest son would have one pique, the second two and so on, so that the younger son that would have the original sigla, inheriting the same symbol as his father.\n\nAnalyses were made to check if families have actually used the same symbols throughout generations, due to some supposed inconsistencies within some families. It became apparent that the inconsistencies had historical or genealogical motivations, and that these symbols were inherited through generations and preserved as part of Póvoa's local traditions. Hundreds of different marks were studied leading to 84 different original families.\n\nUseful places for the study of Siglas Poveiras are the religious temples located not only in the city and its rural area, but also in all the Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, especially in the Minho region (in Portugal) and in Galicia.\n\nThe Poveiros, throughout generations, used to make inscriptions in the doors of chapels close to beaches or hills as a journey mark or as \"campaign promises\" (\"promessas de campanha\"). This has been observed in Nossa Senhora da Bonança in Esposende's beach, and Santa Trega in A Guarda Hill, Galicia. The mark inscribed would serve as a marker for the Poveiros that would come later indicating either the passage of the inscriber or the attempts to procure good luck from the venerated saint of that place.\n\nOn September 23, 1991 a sculpture honouring Siglas Poveiras was inaugurated in the festival of Santa Trega in North-western Iberia, as a means to perpetuate the ancient and lost door of the Chapel of Santa Trega known to be covered with Siglas Poveiras. After the inauguration, an expedition aboard the Lancha Poveira Fé em Deus (Faith in God) came from Póvoa de Varzim, whose fishermen went up to the Trega and prayed in the chapel dedicated to the patron saint of the hill. The hills close to the coast, by being visible by the sea, have always had an importance in the Poveiros sect traditions. Long ago, the fishing class went to this hill to pray to the saint in a ritual with chants attempting to change the winds so that they could return home.\n\nSiglas, being used in the same way, can be found in the temples of Senhora da Abadia and São Bento da Porta Aberta, in Terras de Bouro, São Torcato, in Guimarães and Senhora da Guia, in Vila do Conde. In the municipality of Póvoa de Varzim, these can also be found in the Chapel of Santa Cruz in Balasar.\n\nThe caught fish in a boat’s net belonged to its owner, regardless of what position he held within the Lanchão or Sardinheiro castes. The fish caught was thus marked with the sigla and delivered to the fishing net owner. These fish marks are usually blows made in sigla form in different parts of the fish. \n\nThe crew of each boat also had a sigla that was used by all the members of the crew. In the case of a worker shifting to another boat, he would have to adopt the sigla of the new boat. These boat marks were known as \"divisas\".\n\nThe divisas are true \"arms shields\", intended for the boat’s recognition; curiously, however, they were different from the boat’s owner's mark. One should notice that all the Poveiro belongings were marked with his personal mark, except for the boat. This fact seems to indicate that the boats were predominantly subject to magical-religious invocations, often adopting a protecting-saint for the boat and thus earning a mythical character and also surrounded by protecting symbols.\n\nThe Poveiros wrote their sigla in the table of the mother church upon marriage, as a way for recording the event. This usage of siglas can still be found in Igreja Matriz of Póvoa de Varzim (the mother church since 1757) and in Igreja da Lapa.\n\nA table in the old Church of Misericórdia that had the function of a mother church until 1757 kept thousands of siglas, the obtainment of which would aid in a deeper study of the siglas poveiras, but these were destroyed when the church was demolished.\n\nThe siglas were first studied by António de Santos Graça in his book \"Epopeia dos Humildes\" (\"The Odyssey of the Humble\"). Published in 1952, the book contains hundreds of siglas and the history and maritime tragedy of Póvoa. Other works of his are \"O Poveiro\" (The Poveiro, 1932), \"A Crença do Poveiro nas Almas Penadas\" (Poveiro Beliefs Regarding Dead Souls, 1933) e \"Inscrições Tumulares por Siglas\" (Tomb Inscriptions Using Siglas, 1942).\nSantos Graça believed the siglas poveiras were related with the Castro peoples, and the author tried to link them with other dissimilar modern marks, found in different fishing communities with the Iberian writing system. This theory was never proved. \n\nAfter a visit to the \"Nationalmuseet\" in Copenhagen, Octávio Lixa Filgueiras, on the other hand, found objects marked with \"home-marks\" from Funen also known as Fyn in Denmark. Moreover, the complex hereditary mark system of Póvoa de Varzim was also found in Fyn .\n\nThe Siglas also known as Marcas development is at least partly, attributed to the Norsemen that settled in the town during the 10th century and 11th century. This form of primitive writing developed within the community of Póvoa de Varzim was kept due to the practice of endogamy. Also, the ‘marcas’ similarity with the Scandinavian tradition of using specific \"bomärken\" (\"homestead marks\") for signatures and for marking property is worthy of note.\n\nEach base sigla has a name, normally related with daily objects, but this sigla-object association occurred at a later date for both, Póvoa de Varzim and the system studied in the Danish region of Funnen. The hourglass of Funnen was drawn in the same way as the chalice of Póvoa de Varzim thus indicating that both are remnants of a later era.\n\nSiglas have also been compared to runes, especially in the 1960s when Lixa Filgueiras called for further studies on the matter. \n\nComparing only identical Nordic runes:\nAccording to Santos Graça, the siglas were inspired by daily objects of Póvoa de Varzim residents:\n\nThe use of the Latin alphabet to identify boats occurred only very recently in Póvoa de Varzim, when comparing with other fishing communities that used some kind of marks. In 1944, in a set of 25 boat marks, only one used the Latin Alphabet: \"F.A. de Francisco Fogateira\", that substituted the marks: \"lanchinha\" and \"double of two \"piques\" in cross and \"coice\"\". In Aver-o-Mar, in a group of 38 boats, eight vessels already used the alphabet and marks.\n\nDespite not having the use of previous periods, the \"\"banheiros\" of Bairro Norte district still place their family mark in their belonging at the beach, the same occurs in the family's home and the mark is written in the belongings. The Casa dos Pescadores da Póvoa de Varzim, the fishermen association, still accepts marks as correct forms of signature. Marks are also used to decorate the city, as in pavements. Street plates in the city center of Póvoa de Varzim use them to revive the use and as a local identity by placing several marks belonging to traditional Povoan families.\n\n"}

It was replaced by English as the everyday and family language of British Romani, leading to what is known as \"Para-Romani\" or the presence of Romani features in the English used by the Romani.\n\nAn example of a phrase in Angloromani is:\n\"The mush was jalling down the drom with his gry\" ('The man was walking down the road with his horse')\n\nThis differs from the presence of loanwords (such as that used locally in Edinburgh and Northumberland) from the Romani language, such as \"lollipop\" (originally a toffee apple), \"pal\" (originally Romani \"phral\" 'brother'), and \"chav\" (originally \"chavo\" 'boy').\n\nA document from about the 17th century titled the \"Winchester confessions\" indicates that British Romani was itself a dialect of the northern branch of Romani sharing a close similarity to Welsh Romani. However, the language in a modern context has deteriorated from the Indic-based vocabulary, morphology, and influences from Greek and other Balkan languages of the seventeenth century to a Para-Romani dialect typical of modern Anglo-Romani with sentence endings influenced by English, while Welsh Romani retains the original grammatical system.\n\nHistorically, the variants of Welsh and English Romani constituted the same variant of Romani, share characteristics, and are historically closely related to dialects spoken in France, Germany (Sinti), Scandinavia, Spain, Poland, North Russia and the Baltic states. Such dialects are descended from the first wave of Romani immigrants into western, northern and southern Europe in the late Middle Ages. Few documents survive into modern times, the \"Winchester confessions\" document c.1616 highlights the variant of English Romani and contains a high number of words still used in the modern Northern European Romani dialects and until recently also Welsh Romani; Examples include: \"Balovas\" (pig meat bacon), \"Lovina\" (beer, alcohol), \"ruk\" (tree), \"Smentena\" (cream), \"Boba\" (beans) and \"Folaso\" (glove), and all such words occur in all western dialects of Romani, with few English loanwords present.\n\nHowever, the \"Winchester confessions\" document indicates that English grammatical structures were influencing speakers of English Romani (within a London context where the document was sourced) to adopt an (adjective-noun) configuration rather than the (noun-adjective) configuration of other Romani dialects, including modern Welsh Romani. The document suggests a complete separation between Thieves' Cant, and the variant of English Romani of the early 17th century. This has particular implications when dating the origin and development of Anglo-Romani and its split from Welsh Romani. The author of one such study believes English Romani gradually lost its distinctive syntax, phonology and morphology while other scholars believe Anglo-Romani developed relatively quickly after the Romanis' arrival in England in the sixteenth century, in a development similar to the Pidgin or Creole languages.\n\nAnglo-Romani was already developing in the seventeenth century although the change from the original English Romani is unclear. The \"Winchester confessions\" document disproves a sudden morphological change, and lends support to a strict linguistic separation between a Canting language and English Romani whose speakers used a separate and distinct Romani language when speaking amongst themselves. A situation which existed one hundred years later as testified by James Poulter 1775: \"the English Gypsies spoke a variant of their own language that none other could understand,\" indicating the language was distinct from the common \"Canting tongue\" of England. Romani of that time was a language of everyday communication, of practical use, and not a secret language.\n\nThe original Romani was used exclusively as a family or clan language, during occasional encounters between various Romani clans. It was not a written language, but more a conversational one, used by families to keep conversations amongst themselves in public places such as markets unintelligible to others. It was not used in any official capacity in schools or administrative matters, and so lacked the vocabulary for these terms. Such terms were simply borrowed from English. However, to keep the language undecipherable to outsiders, the Romani speakers coined new terms that were a combination or variation of the original English terms. For example, a forester is called \"veshengro\", from the Romani word for forest, \"vesh\"; a restaurant is a \"habbinkerr\" from the words \"habbin\", food, and \"kerr\", house, thus literally \"food-house\"; and a mayor is a \"gavmoosh\", from the words \"gav\", village, town, and \"moosh\", man, literally \"town-man\". Gradually, the British Romani began to give up their language in favour of English, though they retained much of the vocabulary, which they now use occasionally in English conversation – as Angloromani.\n\nThe origins of the Romani language are in India, and the core of the vocabulary and grammar still resemble modern Indic languages like Urdu, Kashmiri, and Punjabi. Linguists have been investigating the dialects of Romani since the second half of the eighteenth century, and although there are no ancient written records of the language, it has been possible to reconstruct the development of Romani from the medieval languages of India to its present forms as spoken in Europe. Although the language remains similar at its core, it is sometimes quite difficult for Romani people from different regions to understand one another if they have not had any exposure to other dialects before.\n\nAnglo-Romani is a mixed language, with the base languages being Romani and English (something referred to as Para-Romani in Romani linguistics).\n\nSome English lexical items that are archaic or only used in idiomatic expressions in Standard English survive in Anglo-Romani, for example \"moniker\" and \"swaddling\".\n\nEvery region where Angloromani is spoken is characterised by a distinct colloquial English style; this often leads outsiders to believe that the speech of Romnichals is regional English. The distinct rhotic pronunciation of the Southern Angloromani variety also means that many outsiders perceive Southern Romanichal Travellers to be from the West Country because West Country English is also rhotic. Indeed, many Romanichal Travellers from the South of England or the Midlands region have a slightly West Country sounding accent; in fact it is a Southern Romnichal Traveller accent.\n\nAmong Anglo-Romani speakers, there is variation depending on where groups originally settled before learning English:\n\n\nThe members of these groups consider that not only do their dialects/accents differ, but also that they are of different regional groups. The speakers of Southern Angloromani took the regional identity of Southern Romanichal Travellers and the speakers of Northern Anglormani took the regional identity of Northern Romanichal Travellers. At the time of settlement, these divisions were somewhat reflective of geographic location. They did travel, but until travel became modernized, the migrations were relatively local.\n\nOverall, Anglo-Romani consonants reflect the standard British English consonantal system with the exception that the rhotic is trilled and /x/ appears in certain dialects. Anglo-Romani may sometimes be rhotic and in other cases is non-rhotic like English non-rhotic dialects; for example, in Romani \"terno\" \"young\" (passing through the stage \"tarno\") can be rendered as \"tawno\".\n\nRomani allowed for two word orders – Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) and Verb-Subject-Object (VSO).\n\nNegation in Anglo-Romani is achieved through the use of the word \"kek\":\n\n\"Be\" is optionally deleted:\n\nReduplication is employed for emphasis:\n\nIn the 16th century, the Romani language was an inflected language, employing two genders, plurality and case marking. Anglo-Romani is first referenced in 1566–1567. In the late 19th century, Romani personal pronouns became inconsistently marked, according to Leland, who also notes that case distinction began fading overall, and gender marking also disappeared. George Borrow notes that in 1874, some Romani speakers were still employing complete inflection, while some were adopting the English syntax with a Romani lexicon. It seems to be around 1876 that gender distinction was no longer seen; however, the continued use of Romani plural forms was noted, along with English verb conjugation. By 1923, some plural endings were still being used on nouns, but English prepositions were used instead of Romani postpositions. Current usage has lost almost all Romani morphology and instead uses English morphology with Romani lexical items.\n\nThe Anglo-Romani Project, an initiative of the Romani community of Blackburn and the Lancashire Traveller Education Service, has samples of Anglo-Romani conversation as well as documentation, which it has collected with the aim of documenting the Anglo-Romani lexicon in its regional and dialectal variation. Samples of conversation and their meaning can be found here: Samples of Anglo-Romani, Audio files\n\nLord's prayer sample text, with English elements in italics:\n\n\nThe first published samples of the Bible in Romany were translated by Wester Boswell and published in 1875. Sylvester \"Wester\" Boswell (1812-1890) was an English Gypsy who spoke Romanes. In the 1870s he translated some Scripture selections into English. These were published as \"Genuine Romany Compositions\" on pages 226-235 of a book called the \"Dialect of the English Gypsies\" by Bath C. Smart and Henry Thomas Crofton. The book was compiled in 1874 and published in London in 1875. In the Romany compositions, the words were written down using an orthography developed by A.J. Ellis which was used by the English Dialect Society. and they adopted the Greek letter χ to represent the sound being nearly that of ch in German or Welsh. The parts of Romanes which were English borrowings were italicised.\n\nIn 1973 the British and Foreign Bible Society produced a leaflet called Shavved and the Got Latchered (Lost and Found), and then in 1979 produced \"A Kushti Lav (Good News in Romany)\" and in 1981 \"More Kuchti Lavs\" which were selected passages from the New Testament. Later Scripture Gift Mission now called SGM Lifewords produced \"The Kushti Bokkengro (The Good Shepherd)\" in 1985 and another booklet called \"The Drom (The Way)\" in 1995. These were selected passages from the Bible.\n\nThere is no complete book of the Bible in Romany, but some of these items can now be found online on www.youversion.com listed under \"Romany: Angloromani\".\n\n\n\n"}

The novel is a prequel to the popular title Legend. The novel details the early life and events of the character Druss, it is followed by \"The Legend of Deathwalker\", which deals with later events in his life between this book and the events in \"Legend\".\n\nThe story begins in Druss's village in the Drenai Empire. He is a misfit and socially awkward. While he is away from the village chopping wood, a party of slavers, led by Harib Ka and the master swordsman Collan, comes to the village and kills or enslaves everyone they find. With his dying breath, Druss' father tells him to fetch the family battle-axe (Snaga), which was stolen by his grandfather Bardan. Druss meets the hunter Shadak, who is hunting the slavers to avenge the death of his son, and they join forces to pursue them. Shadak succeeds in interrogating Harib Ka before Druss kills him, and learns that Rowena (who Harib Ka has realised has mystic powers) has been taken to the port of Mashrapur. Druss travels to Mashrapur and meets Shadak's friend Sieben. Together they find out that Rowena will be transported to the distant land of Ventria. Druss attempts to break onto the ship to rescue her, but is ambushed by Collan's men on the dock. Druss is badly wounded but survives, and Shadak reappears to kill Collan. However, they fail to stop the ship from setting sail without them.\n\nWhen Druss recovers, he and Sieben (who is fleeing a jealous lover's husband) join a group of mercenaries recruited by the Ventrian soldier Bodasen, who is going to support the emperor Gorben in a war in Ventria against the neighbouring Naashanites and rebels. En route, they are attacked by pirates; and during this fight Sieben sees a demon materialise to defend Druss and comes to the conclusion that Druss is possessed. The soldiers arrive in Ventria and succeed in rescuing Gorben from a siege. Gorben is impressed with Druss and promotes him to serve in his elite bodyguard- \"The Immortals\". Sieben learns from a priest that Snaga is harbouring an evil spirit, but fails to persuade Druss to abandon the weapon. Meanwhile, Rowena has married Michanek, the leading general of the Naashanites. He is an honourable man and becomes concerned when she falls ill. He is told that she is suffering as a result of her mystical powers, and has these removed, along with her memory, in order to save her life.\n\nDuring a break in the war, Druss goes travelling and loses Snaga in a river. Initially thinking he is free of it, he learns from the a wandering Source priest that it has been found by a brutal warlord, Cajivak. He and the mercenary Varsava set out to recover the axe and kill Cajivak, but Druss is captured and imprisoned in Cajivak's dungeon. At first he wastes away, but with the help of a former prisoner succeeds in regaining his strength and escaping, only to find that Sieben, Varsava and the archer Eskodas have mounted a rescue attempt. Druss kills Cajivak and recovers Snaga, then returns to the army.\n\nBy this point in the war the Naashanites are desperate and attempt to use a demon to assassinate Gorben, but he is saved by Druss thanks to Snaga- the only weapon that seems to hurt the demon. Druss also learns that Rowena has married Michanek and that her memory has been erased. He vows to kill Michanek and reclaim Rowena as his own as the army moves to besiege the last Naashanite stronghold, where Michanek has his home. Michanek has learned of Rowena's past and attempts to reconcile her to the idea of going back to Druss, but she will not have it. During the siege, Michanek is killed and Rowena takes poison since she cannot face life alone. Druss is forced to venture into the netherworld to bring her back. Druss eventually succeeds in finding Rowena, and despite a trick of Snaga's, rescues her. In the process he banishes the demon from the axe. Then he and his companions return to Drenai.\n\nThe epilogue deals with the events of Skeln Pass, a famous battle late in Druss's career (by this time he is presumed to be in his mid-forties). Gorben has gone mad and invades Drenai, and Druss and Sieben go to Skeln Pass to meet the troops and raise morale. The Ventrians launch a surprise attack, catching the Drenai unprepared, and Druss and Sieben are caught up in the fighting. Under the leadership of Earl Delnar, and with Druss' inspirational presence, the Drenai manage to hold up the Ventrian advance. In a night raid, Druss accidentally kills his old friend Bodasen. The next day, a furious Gorben commits the Immortals, who have never been defeated, to battle. In the fierce fighting that ensues, Sieben is mortally wounded, but Druss and the Drenai manage to hold the Immortals long enough for reinforcements to arrive and win the war. In the rout, Gorben is killed by his own officers.\n\nDuring the battle, Rowena, who has stayed at home with Sieben's wife Niobe, dies. She tells Niobe that she knew she was dying but sent Druss to Skeln Pass so that he would not have to witness it, as it would break his heart.\n\n"}

(, Πανθεσσαλονίκειος Αθλητικός Όμιλος Κωνσταντινοπολιτών, \"Panthessaloníkios Athlitikós Ómilos Konstantinopolitón\", \"Pan-Thessalonian Athletic Club of Constantinopolitans\"), commonly known in European competitions as PAOK, is the professional basketball department of the major Greek multi-sports club A.C. PAOK, which was founded in 1926 and is based in Thessaloniki. Their home ground is PAOK Sports Arena, a 8,500 seating capacity indoor stadium. The team has established a firm reputation in Greek basketball, especially for their success in European competitions. They have twice won the Greek Basket League (1959, 1992), three times the Greek Basketball Cup (1984, 1995, 1999) and they have also won two European Cups: the FIBA Saporta Cup (1991) and the FIBA Korać Cup (1994). PAOK were runners-up in 1992 and 1996 FIBA Saporta Cup Finals and participated in the 1993 FIBA European League Final Four, finishing 3rd.\n\nThe men's basketball section of the multi-sports club PAOK AC was created in 1928, when Alekos Alexiadis, a young member of the administration council of PAOK AC (founded in 1926), took the initiative to create a men's basketball team. He \"gave birth\" to the basketball department again, after World War II. After the war, Alekos Alexiadis began to organize a basketball team from the children that played at the only basketball court in Thessaloniki. The first honor for PAOK's basketball section was the win of the 1959 Greek League. The team was crowned the Champions of Greece, with the following players; Dapontes, Kyriakou, Oikonomou, Paschalis, Stalios, Kokkos, Theoridis, Angelidis, Stergiou, and Konstantinidis, and player-coach Iraklis Klagas. Four years later, the Greek League was reconstructed into a professional National League, but PAOK was placed in the Second National Division, where they won an immediate promotion to the first division the next year. The worst season of the club to date was in 1977, when PAOK avoided relegation, with a 66–53 play-out win over Dimokritos.\nPAOK met Panathinaikos in its first Greek Cup Final, in 1982. The Athenians managed to scrape through a two-point victory, despite the game being played in Alexandreio Melathron, the then PAOK home arena. In the next season, the team finished second to Aris, after being defeated in only one game by the champions.\n\nThe success of both Aris and PAOK, fueled the ongoing rivalry between their fans, that had long been established in football. In 1984, the two teams reached the Greek Cup Final. PAOK head coach, Faidon Matthaiou, in trying to boost his team's morale, ordered the players to completely shave their heads. PAOK won the Greek Cup by four points (74–70), in what is now remembered as the \"final of the shaven heads\".\n\nThe then 22-year-old Bane Prelević, debuted in the 1988–89 season. He became the definitive leader of PAOK, and a fan favorite. He was often compared to the great Nikos Galis, who was at the time the captain of Aris. Prelević was often quoted for his loyalty to the team. He had a number of injuries and medical emergencies because of weak legs, but he would constantly choose to take heavy dosages of painkillers, rather than missing out on important games.\n\nOver the 80s, PAOK was second to Aris in the Greek League.\n\nPAOK brought limitless joy to its fans, by winning the European 2nd-tier level FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup, when PAOK defeated CAI Zaragoza in Geneva, by a score of 76–72, on March 26, 1991.\n\nThe next season, PAOK reached once again in the final of the same competition (called FIBA European Cup), but lost to Real Madrid Asegurator, by a score of 63–65. The game was going to overtime, as the two teams were equal at 63 points, when Panagiotis Fasoulas lost the ball by Rickey Brown in the last 2 seconds, and Real Madrid scored an unexpected basket. The same year, PAOK won the Greek League championship, by beating out Aris in the final four mini league and Olympiacos in the play-off finals.\n\nThe 1992–93 season PAOK with a brilliant starting five roster (John Korfas, Bane Prelević, Cliff Levingston, Ken Barlow and Panagiotis Fasoulas) and under the coaching of Dušan Ivković, participated in the 1992–93 FIBA European League (now called EuroLeague), which was the club's first appearance in the top-tier level European league, and managed to reach the Final Four in Piraeus, Athens. PAOK lost in the semifinal game to the Italian champions Benetton Treviso, which was led by the Croat superstar Toni Kukoč, by a score of 77–79 and two days later in the third-place game PAOK defeated Real Madrid Teka of Arvydas Sabonis and Rickey Brown.\n\nIn 1994, PAOK returned to European success, by winning the European 3rd-tier level FIBA Korać Cup, in a two-leg final against Stefanel Trieste, winning both at home and away, by 9 points. The following year, PAOK won the Greek Cup, in a 19-point victory against Chipita Panionios, 72–53. The 1995–96 season PAOK reached once again in the final of the FIBA European Cup, but lost to Taugrés, by a score of 81–88. Three years later in 1999, PAOK again won the Greek Cup, by defeating AEK, by a score of 71–54.\n\nThe new home of PAOK, the PAOK Sports Arena, able to hold 8,500 fans, was inaugurated on 17 March 2000. That marked the end of a long period of time of sharing the home court of Alexandreio Melathron with Aris. Bane Prelević returned to PAOK, after quick spells at Kinder Bologna and AEK, and then quit basketball at the end of the season. He later returned to PAOK in the 2001–02 season, as an assistant coach.\n\nDuring the 90s, PAOK was one of the top teams in the Greek League, winning in 1992, and playing in the finals in 1994, 1998 and 2000. PAOK played in the semifinals each year, and won 3rd place in 1993, 1997 and 1999.\n\nPAOK played in the inaugural 2000–01 Euroleague, reaching the Round of 16. However, difficult financial situations led the Greek finalists to struggle in the Greek League, finishing in only 8th place. Over the next few years, results in the Greek League started improving - in 2001-2002, PAOK still finished 8th, while in 2002-2003, PAOK finished in 7th pace. Prelević became the team's head coach, and led the team into a short winning streak. PAOK had limited success in European competitions around this time, participating in FIBA competitions.\n\nPAOK finished in 6th place in the 2003–04 Greek League season, boasting a squad full of youngsters, like Panagiotis Vasilopoulos, Kostas Vasileiadis and Loukas Mavrokefalidis. During the season, PAOK withdrew from FIBA competitions, and in the 2004-2005 season, made their debut in the ULEB Cup, reaching the quarefinals, but losing to BC Lietuvos rytas. In the Greek League, PAOK finished in 6th place. In 2005-2006, PAOK finished in 6th place in the Greek League.\n\nA month after the start of the 2006–07 Greek League season, Prelević was replaced as head coach by Kostas Pilafidis, and he then assumed a non-technical position, as the General Manager of the team. During a game that year, PAOK and Aris put on a spectacular show that PAOK ended up winning, after two overtime periods. PAOK returned to the ULEB Cup, once again playing in the playoffs. In the Greek League, PAOK finished 6th after losing to Olympiacos.\n\nThe 2007-2008 season became one of the worst in PAOK history, with PAOK finishing in disastrous 12th place. However, during the season, PAOK picked up a great victory against Olympiacos. Disappointing European campaigns have led to PAOK taking a break, focusing on the Greek League. Over the next to seasons, 2008-2009 and 2009-2010, PAOK rebounded, finishing in 7th and 5th place respectively. Before the 2009-2010 season, Soulis Markopoulos became the new head coach for PAOK.\n\nPAOK won 3rd place in the Greek League in 2010-2011. The success allowed PAOK to play in the EuroLeague qualifying tournament in 2011-2012. In 2011-2012, however, PAOK finished in a disappointing 8th place in the Greek League and missed European competition for 2012-2013. In 2012-2013, PAOK finished in 5th place, and returned to European competition, in the 2nd tier EuroCup Basketball. In the Greek League, PAOK won 3rd place in 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. In 2015-2016, PAOK finished 5th. After the 2015–17 FIBA–Euroleague Basketball controversy, PAOK returned to FIBA competition, playing in the Basketball Champions League. After finishing 5th in 2016-2017, Markoupolos was replaced by Ilias Papatheodorou. In 2017-2018, PAOK won 3rd place in the Greek League.\n\nPAOK played its home games for many years at the 5,183 seat Alexandreio Melathron (Nick Galis Hall). In 2000, the club moved to the 8,500 seat PAOK Sports Arena.\n\n\n\n50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors\nGreek Basket League MVP\nGreek League Top Scorer\nGreek League Top Rebounder\nGreek League Assist Leader\nGreek League Coach of the Year\nGreek Cup MVP\n\n1990–91 FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup\n\n\n1993–94 FIBA Korać Cup\n\nThis is a list of P.A.O.K.

The division was named after Sir John Robertson, the fifth Premier of New South Wales.\n\nOriginally, Robertson was anchored in rural central NSW, encompassing the area around Dubbo, Mudgee and Wellington. It moved eastward to take in Gosford in 1913, and since then it has been moved further eastward in successive redistributions. By 1969, it had moved to approximately its current position on the Central Coast, immediately north of the Hawkesbury River, and now includes none of its original territory. Nonetheless, it has retained the name of Robertson, in part because the Australian Electoral Commission is required to preserve the names of original electorates where possible.\n\nIt encompasses the towns of Woy Woy, Gosford and Terrigal.\n\nTwo of its members have served as Senators prior or subsequent to their tenures on Robertson. Former Senator Belinda Neal was elected in Robertson in 2007 and Deborah O'Neill became a Senator shortly after losing Robertson in 2013.\n\nIn recent years, Robertson has been a bellwether electorate in federal elections, taking on a character similar to mortgage belt seats on Sydney's outer fringe. It has been held by a member of the party of government since the 1983 federal election.

It was in Trepassey Harbour where the flight of the \"Friendship\" took off, with Amelia Earhart on board, the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nTrepassey originates from the French word trépassés (\"dead men\"), named after Baie des Trépassés on the Brittany coast of France. It is believed that it acquired this name due to the many shipwrecks that have occurred off its coast. Trepassey is the name of the harbour, the bay and the community. Later the translation was used as 'Dead Man's Bay' due to the tragic shipwrecks along the coast. Alternatively, the 'tre' element of the name could come from the Welsh word for 'town', explained by the Welsh influence of the Vaughan family.\n\nFrench explorer Jacques Cartier passed through Trepassey Bay during his second voyage of exploration in 1536. Later, French, Spanish and Portuguese lived and fished near the area. Early English settlement attempts failed, and it was not until the latter part of the 17th century that the French settled the area. In 1702, during The War of The Spanish Succession, Commodore John Leake of the Royal Navy entered the harbour as part of a large naval expedition aimed at raiding numerous French settlements. Leake captured many French fishing ships and attacked French fishing stations, destroying them and driving the French from Trepassey. Until the Treaty of Utretch was signed, Trepassey was the sole settlement where English and French borders in Newfoundland met. Later fishermen from the West Country of England arrived, to be followed by large numbers of Irish and by the 1770s the Irish formed the majority of the population.\n\nIn the decades following the Second World War, the fishing industry boomed in Trepassey, and the town became increasingly affluent. However, its prosperity declined in 1991 with the closing of the local fish plant, which put hundreds out of work.\n\n\nSalmon and trout fishing in the bay, nearby lakes and rivers. Caribou and other wildlife are often sighted near town along the road. Trepassey features a museum with artifacts from Amelia Earhart's flight. Cape Race lighthouse is nearby. Capelin fish beach themselves yearly in mid-July, which is also a good time to spot whales feeding on the capelin. One can also collect capelin on the beach at this time.\n\n"}

In 1922, he formed a company, Birdseye Seafood, Inc., to freeze fish fillets with chilled air at -45 °F (-43 °C). In 1924, he developed an entirely new process for commercially viable quick-freezing: packing fish in cartons, then freezing the contents between two refrigerated surfaces under pressure. Birdseye created a new company, General Seafood Corporation, to promote this method. In 1929, Birdseye sold his company and patents for $22 million to Goldman Sachs and the Postum Company, which eventually became General Foods Corporation, and which founded the Birds Eye Frozen Food Company. Birdseye continued to work with the company, further developing frozen food technology.\n\nAs part of General Foods, Birds Eye merged with Kraft Foods and Philip Morris USA to form the Altria Group. Birds Eye was sold to Dean Foods in 1993 and was independently owned by Birds Eye Foods of Rochester, New York until it was purchased by Pinnacle Foods in 2009.\n\nIn March 2010, Pinnacle announced it would be closing the Rochester headquarters and moving operations to New Jersey.\n\nThe Birds Eye brand is used extensively throughout the UK and Ireland. In other parts of Europe the Iglo brand is used.\n\nThe company's staple product, the fish finger, was developed in 1955 at its factory in Great Yarmouth, by H A J Scott. One of the company's main UK pea processing sites is in Gipsyville, Hull; the company formerly operated a large pea processing factory in the same area, opened 1967, closed 2007. Birds Eye also operated a factory in Grimsby, founded 1929, closed 2005, with the loss of 650 jobs.\n\nUnilever announced in August 2006 that the UK subsidiary brand was sold to UK-based private equity group Permira.\n\nThe Birds Eye brand is owned by Simplot Australia Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the J.R. Simplot Company. Simplot purchased Birds Eye and many of Australia's leading food brands from Pacific Dunlop's Pacific Brands in the mid-1990s. In 2015, Birds Eye was awarded by \"Reader's Digest\" as ‘\"Australia’s Most Trusted Frozen Food Brand\". Birds Eye products are produced at the company's processing facilities in Devonport, Ulverstone, Tasmania, and Bathurst, New South Wales, as well as from imported ingredients. Some seafood items are processed overseas and the completed product imported.\n\nOn 9 February 2006, Unilever announced it was looking to sell the UK Birds Eye brand, as well as the European version – Iglo (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands and Portugal). These brands were worth £836M in sales, with profits of £115M a year, and employed 3,500 staff across Europe with 1,800 located in the UK.\n\nOn 28 August 2006, it was confirmed that Unilever had agreed to the sale of the UK brand, held since the late 1930s, to private equity house Permira for £1.2bn.\n\nBirds Eye has acquired many well-established brands, some of which are distributed regionally and not nationally. The following brands are owned and distributed by Birds Eye:\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Captain Birdseye was an advertising mascot of the brand, from the 1960s to late 1990s. Appearing in numerous television and billboard commercials since 1967, he was played by the actor John Hewer between then and 1998 e.g. in 1986 advert for Birdsye Fish Fingers. After the retirement of the original actor, the brand was relaunched with a younger man with designer stubble (played by Thomas Pescod), but was less popular, and the character was dropped from Birdeye's advertising. A 2014 redesign of the brand's packaging includes artwork resembling the original Captain Bird's Eye.\n\nChild actress Patsy Kensit appeared in an early 1970s advert for frozen peas. This featured a jingle including the slogan \"Sweet as the moment when the pod went 'pop'\" but as years went on they reverted to a jingle \"Come Home To Birds Eye Country\" – a series of adverts from the late 1960s to in or around the late 1980s to early 1990s.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, June Whitfield appeared in a series of television advertisements for Birds Eye products, featuring the concluding voice-over line: \"... it can make a dishonest woman of you!\". The series was the brainchild of advertising art director Vernon Howe and was mentioned in several of his obituaries.\n\nAdvertising campaigns of the 1980s included one for Potato waffles that had a jingle including the words \"Waffley versatile\". A popular advertisement for Birds Eye Steakhouse Grills featured a scene of hungry building workers heading home in a minibus and singing about what they were hoping their partners would serve with their steak burgers. The song to the tune of \"Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)\" included the tag line \"we hope it's chips\".\n\nIn 2013, DNA tests revealed that horsemeat was present in Birds Eye chili con carne that was sold in Belgium and was produced and supplied by a Belgian group named Frigilunch. As a result, Birds Eye withdrew all other products produced by the same supplier in the UK and Ireland.\n"}
{"id": "2127300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127300", "title": "Hinduism in Pakistan", "text": "Hinduism in Pakistan\n\nHinduism is the second largest religion in Pakistan after Islam. Pakistan gained independence from Britain in 1947, and in the first census afterwards in 1951, Hindus made 1.6% of the total population of West Pakistan (now Pakistan), and 22% of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). However, before partition, according to the 1941 census, Hindus constituted 14% of the Population in West Pakistan and 28% of the Population in East Pakistan Hindus made up 1.85% of Pakistan's population according to the 1998 census - although the Pakistan Hindu Council claims there are around 8 million Hindus living in Pakistan, comprising 4% of the Pakistani population. As of 2010, Pakistan has the fifth-largest Hindu population in the world and by 2050 may rise to the fourth-largest Hindu population in the world, reaching 5.6 million and constituting 2% of the Pakistani population. However, voluntary as well as forced religious conversions have brought down the number of Hindus in Pakistan by up to 1,000 per year.\n\nAfter Pakistan gained independence from the British Raj, 4.7 million of West Pakistan's Hindus and Sikhs moved to India as refugees. Hindus in Pakistan are primarily concentrated in Sindh, where the majority of Hindu enclaves are found in Pakistan. They speak a variety of languages such as Sindhi, Seraiki, Aer, Dhatki, Gera, Goaria, Gurgula, Jandavra, Kabutra, Koli, Loarki, Marwari, Sansi, Vaghri, and Gujarati. Although small in numbers, Hindus in Pakistan are not less complex than in other parts of the world. Many Hindus, especially in the rural areas, follow the teachings of local Sufi \"pīrs\" (Urdu: \"spiritual guide\") or adhere to the 14th-century saint Ramdevji, whose main temple Shri Ramdev Pir temple is located in Tando Allahyar. A growing number of urban Hindu youth in Pakistan associate themselves with ISKCON society. Other communities worship manifold \"Mother Goddesses\" as their clan or family patrons. A different branch, the Nanakpanth, follows the teachings of the Guru Granth Sahib, also known as the holy book of the Sikhs. This diversity, especially in rural Sindh, often thwarts classical definitions between Hinduism, Sikhism and Islam.\n\nOne of the most important places of worship for Hindus in Pakistan is the shrine of Shri Hinglaj Mata temple in Balochistan. The annual Hinglaj Yatra is the largest Hindu pilgrimage in Pakistan.\n\nThe Rig Veda, the oldest Hindu text, is believed to have been composed in the Punjab region of modern-day Pakistan (and India) on the banks of the Indus River around 1500 BCE. Various archaeological finds such as the Swastika symbol, Yogic postures, what appears to be like a \"Pasupati\" image that was found on the seals of the people of Mohenjo-daro, in Sindh, point to early influences that may have shaped Hinduism. The religious beliefs and folklore of the Indus valley people have become a major part of the Hindu faith that evolved in this part of the South Asia.\n\nThe Sindh kingdom and its rulers play an important role in the Indian epic story of the Mahabharata. In addition, a Hindu legend states that the Pakistani city of Lahore was first founded by Lava, while Kasur was founded by his twin Kusha, both of whom were the sons of Lord Rama of the Ramayana. The Gandhara kingdom of the northwest, and the legendary Gandhara peoples, are also a major part of Hindu literature such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Many Pakistani city names (such as Peshawar and Multan) have Sanskrit roots.\n\nAt the time of Pakistan's creation the 'two nation theory' had been espoused. According to this theory the Hindu minority in Pakistan was to be given a fair deal in Pakistan in order to ensure the protection of the Muslim minority in India. However, Khawaja Nazimuddin, the 2nd Prime Minister of Pakistan stated: \"I do not agree that religion is a private affair of the individual nor do I agree that in an Islamic state every citizen has identical rights, no matter what his caste, creed or faith be\".\n\nAfter the independence of Pakistan in 1947, over 4.7 million Hindus and Sikhs from West Pakistan left for India, and 6.5 million Muslims chose to migrate to Pakistan. The reasons for this exodus were the heavily charged communal atmosphere in British Raj, deep distrust of each other, the brutality of violent mobs and the antagonism between the religious communities. That over 1 million people lost their lives in the bloody violence of 1947 should attest to the fear and hate that filled the hearts of millions of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs who left ancestral homes hastily after independence.\n\nAfter Pakistan gained independence from Britain on 14August 1947, 4.7 million of the country's Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India. In 1947, Hindus constituted 12.9% of Pakistan, which made Pakistan (including present day Bangladesh) the second-largest Hindu-population country after India. In the 1951 census, West Pakistan (now Pakistan) had 1.3% Hindu population, while East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) had 22.05%. After 1971, Bangladesh separated from Pakistan and the population of Hindus and other Non-Muslims declined in Pakistan as Bangladesh population was no longer part of the census conducted in Pakistan. The 1998 census of Pakistan recorded 2,443,614 Hindus,which (includes 332,343 scheduled caste Hindus). Hindus constitute about 1.6 percent of the total population of Pakistan in 1998 and about 7.5% in the Sindh province.\n\nIn 1956, the government of Pakistan declared 32 castes and tribes, the majority of them Hindus, to be scheduled castes, including Kohlis, Meghawars, and Bheels. The Pakistan Census separates members of scheduled castes, 0.25% of the national population, from other Hindus.\n\nAs per the data from the Election Commission of Pakistan, as of 2018 there were a total of 1.77 million Hindu voters. Hindu voters were 49% of the total in Umerkot and 46% in Tharparkar.\n\nAccording to estimates in Religious Minorities in Pakistan's Elections, the Hindus have a population of 50,000 or more in 11 districts.All of these are in Sindh except one district Rahim Yar Khan in Punjab.\n\nThe percent of population of Hindus (including Hindu jati and scheduled castes) in the provinces in Pakistan, according to the 1998 census:\nAll districts with a Hindu population greater than 2%, according to the 1998 census. In other districts the population of Hindus is less than 1%.\nIn other districts the population of Hindus is less than 1%.\n\n \nThe Pakistan Hindu Panchayat, Pakistan Hindu Council and the \"Pakistani Hindu Welfare Association\" are the primary civic organizations that represent and organise Hindu communities on social, economic, religious and political issues in most of the country, with the exception of the Shiv Temple Society of Hazara, which especially represents community interests in the Hazara region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in addition to being the special guardians of the Shiva temple, at Chitti Gatti village, near Mansehra. The Pakistan Hindu Council runs 13 schools across Tharparkar and also conducts mass wedding of poor Hindu couples.\n\nISKCON also has a presence in Pakistan. It is involved in preaching and distributing Urdu translated Bhagavad Gita. It has a large following among the Scheduled Caste Hindus in Urban areas of Pakistan. There is a significant increase in the influence of Iskcon due to its rejection of caste system.\n\nThere was a Ministry of Minority Affairs in the Government of Pakistan which looked after specific issues concerning Pakistani religious minorities. In 2011, the Government of Pakistan closed the Ministry of Minority Affairs. And a new ministry \"Ministry for National Harmony\" was formed for the protection of the rights of the minorities in Pakistan. But soon in 2013,the Ministry of National Harmony was merged with the Ministry of Religious Affairs despite opposition from the minorities.\n\nThe Constitution's Article 51(2A) provides 10 reserved seats for non-Muslims in the National Assembly, 23 reserved seats for non-Muslims in the four provincial assemblies under Article 106 and four seats for non-Muslims in the Senate of Pakistan. Conventionally, Hindus were allotted 4 or 5 seats.\nThe number of national Assembly seats were increased from 207 in 1997 to 332 in 2002. But the number of non-Muslim reserved seats were not increased from 10. Similarly, the number of seats in Provincial Assembly of Sindh and Punjab were increased from 100 to 159 and 240 to 363 respectively, but the non-Muslim reserved seats were not increased. Although a bill for increasing minorities' seats was introduced by Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, it was not passed. Political parties Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) party is against giving reserved seats for minorities.\n\nIn 1980s Zia ul-Haq introduced a system under which non-Muslims could vote for only candidates of their own religion. Seats were reserved for minorities in the national and provincial assemblies. Government officials stated that the separate electorates system is a form of affirmative action designed to ensure minority representation, and that efforts are underway to achieve a consensus among religious minorities on this issue, but critics argued that under this system Muslim candidates no longer had any incentive to pay attention to the minorities. Hindu community leader Sudham Chand protested against the system but was murdered. In 1999, Pakistan abolished this system.\nHindus and other minorities achieved a rare political victory in 2002 with the removal of separate electorates for Muslims and non-Muslims. The separate electorate system had marginalized non-Muslims by depriving them of adequate representation in the assemblies. The Pakistan Hindu Welfare Association was active by convening a national conference on the issue in December 2000. And in 2001, Hindus, Christians, and Ahmadis successfully conducted a partial boycott of the elections, culminating in the abolishment of the separate electorate system in 2002. This allowed religious minorities to vote for mainstream seats in the National and Provincial assemblies, rather than being confined to voting for only minority seats. Despite the victory, however, Hindus still remain largely disenfranchised.\n\nIn 2006, Ratna Bhagwandas Chawla became the first Hindu woman elected to the Senate of Pakistan. Although there is reservation of seats for women in Pakistan National Assembly, not a single seat was allotted for non-Muslim women till 2018. In 2018, Krishna Kumari Kohli, a Hindu woman became the first non-Muslim women to win a women reserved seat in Senate of Pakistan.\n\nIn 2018, Pakistan general election Mahesh Kumar Malani became the first Hindu candidate who won a general seat in Pakistan National Assembly 2018. He won the seat from Tharparkar-II and thus became the first non-Muslim to win a general seat (non-reserved)in Pakistan national assembly. In the Sindh provincial assembly election which took place along with the Pakistan National Assembly election 2018, Hari Ram Kishori Lal and Giyan Chand Essrani were elected from the Sindh provincial assembly seats. They became the first non-Muslims to win a general seat (non-reserved) in a provincial assembly election.\n\nSome Tamil Hindu families migrated to Pakistan in the early 20th century, when Karachi was developed during the British Raj, and were later joined by Sri Lankan Tamils who arrived during the Sri Lankan Civil War. The Madrasi Para area is home to around 100 Tamil Hindu families. The Maripata Mariamman Temple, which has been demolished, was the biggest Tamil Hindu temple in Karachi.The Drigh Road and Korangi also have a small Tamil Hindu population\n\nThe Kalasha people practice an ancient form of Hinduism mixed with animism. They are considered as a different ethnic religion people by the Pakistan government. They reside in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province.\n\nNanakpanthi are Hindus who revere Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism along with Hindu gods. Today, a large fraction of Sindhi Hindus consider themselves Nanakpanthi.\n\nThe Valmiki or Balmikis are Hindu worshippers of Valmiki, the author of The Ramayana. Most Valmiki Hindus converted to either Christianity or Islam after the partition. However, many of those who converted still worship Valmiki and celebrate Valmiki Jayanti.\n\nAccording to a study, the majority of the scheduled caste Hindus (79%) in Pakistan have experienced discrimination. The discrimination is higher in Southern Punjab (86.5%) compared to the rest of the country. The study found that majority (91.5% ) of the respondents in Rahimyar Khan, Bahawalpur, Tharparkar and Umerkot districts believed that political parties are not giving importance to them. The study also found that the scheduled caste Hindu women are most vulnerable to sexual abuse by Muslim men and young girls are lured into matrimony or abducted and wed through forced conversions.\n\nIn Balochistan province, Hindus are relatively more secure and face less religious persecution. The tribal chiefs in Balochistan, particularly the Jams of Lasbela and Bugti of Dera Bugti, consider non-Muslims like Hindus as members of their own extended family and allows religious freedom. They have never forced Hindus to convert. Also, in Balochistan Hindu places of worship are proportionate to their population. For example, between Uthal and Bela jurisdiction in Lasbela District, there are 18 temples for 5,000 Hindus living in the area, which is an indicator of religious freedom. However, in Khuzdar District and Kalat District, Hindus face discrimination.\n\nIn Peshawar, capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Hindus enjoy religious freedom and live peacefully alongside the Muslims.\nThe city of Peshawar today is home to four Hindu tribes– the Balmiks, the Rajputs, the Heer Ratan Raths and the Bhai Joga Singh Gurdwara community. Since partition, the four tribes have lived in harmony with all religious communities including Muslims. However, there is the lack of upkeep of the dilapidated Hindu temples in the city. The local government always fails to assign caretakers and priests at temples. But in other parts of Kyber Pakhtunkhwa like Buner, Swat and Aurakzai Agencies, Hindu and Sikh families, have been targeted by Taliban for failing to pay Jizya(religious tax) and due to this more than 150 Sikhs and Hindu families in Pakistan's have moved to Hasan Abdal and Rawalpindi in Punjab in 2009\n\nIn central Punjab, Hindus are a small minority. After the partition, Hindus have been converting to Islam under pressure, particularly in Doda village near Sargodha. Due to the low population of Hindus in the Central Punjab, many of the Hindus have married Sikhs and vice versa. Intermarriages between the Hindus and Sikhs are very common there.\n\nThe Indus river is a holy river to many Hindus, and the Government of Pakistan periodically allows small groups of Hindus from India to make pilgrimage and take part in festivities in Sindh and Punjab. Rich Pakistani Hindus go to India and release their loved ones' remains into the Ganges. Those who cannot afford the trip go to Churrio Jabal Durga Mata temple in Nagarparkar.\n\nAccording to the Pakistan’s National Council\nfor Justice and Peace (NCJP) report the average literacy rate among Hindu (upper caste) is 34 percent, Hindu (scheduled castes) is 19 percent compared to the national average of 46.56 percent.\nThe majority of the Hindus in Pakistan are well educated and are active in trade, commerce and civil service.\nIn February 2016, the Provincial Assembly of Sindh approved the Sindh Hindu Marriage Bill for millions of Hindus living in the Sindh Province. The bill paves the way for regulations on registration of marriages and divorce for Hindus and fixes the minimum marrying age for males and females at 18 years-old. At federal level,a Hindu Marriage Bill was proposed in 2016, which was unanimously approved by the National Assembly of Pakistan in 2016 and by the Senate of Pakistan in 2017. In March 2017, the Pakistani President Mamnoon Hussain signed the Hindu Marriage Bill and thereby making it a law. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif also mentioned that the marriage registrars will be established in areas where Hindus stay. The federal law was accepted by all provinces of Pakistan exception Sindh,which has a separate legislation (Sindh Hindu Marriage Act) for Hindu marriage.Thus there are two laws in Pakistan governing Hindu marriages– one for Sindh and other for the rest of the country. The Sindh Hindu Marriage Bill was amended in 2018 to include divorce rights, remarriage rights and financial security of the wife and children after divorce.\n\nHowever, many have criticised the Clause 12(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Bill which says that \"a marriage will be annulled if any of the spouses converts to another religion\". There are fears the clause would be misused for forced conversions of married women the same way young girls are being subjected to forced conversions.\n\nThe Communal violence of the 1940s and the subsequent persecutions have resulted in the destruction of many Hindu temples in Pakistan, although the Hindu community and the Government of Pakistan have preserved and protected many prominent ones. Some ancient Hindu temples in Pakistan draw devotees from across faiths including Muslims.\n\nAccording to a survey, there were 428 Hindu temples in Pakistan at the time of Partition and 408 of them were now turned into toy stores, restaurants, government offices and schools. Among these 11 temples are in Sindh, four in Punjab, three in Balochistan and two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, in November 2019, government of Pakistan started the restoration process for 400 Hindu temples in Pakistan. After restoration, the temples will be reopened to Hindus in Pakistan.\n\nThe Pamwal Das Shiv Mandir, centuries-old historic temple in Baghdadi area of Lyari Town was illegally turned into a Muslim Pir and slaughterhouse for cows by Muslim clerics with the help of Baghdadi police after making series of attacks on Hindu families living in the area.\n\nThe 135,000 acres of temple land is now controlled by the Evacuee Trust Property Board. The historic Kali Bari Hindu Temple has been rented out to a Muslim party in Dera Ismail Khan who converted the temple into a Hotel. The Holy Shiv Temple in Kohat has been converted into a government primary school. The Raam Kunde Complex of Temples at Saidpur village in Islamabad is now a picnic site. Another temple at Rawal Dam in Islamabad has been shut down and the Hindu community believes that the temple is going to dilapidate day by day without being handed over to them. In Punjab, a Hindu temple at Rawalpindi was destroyed and reconstructed to use as a community centre, while in Chakwal the Bhuwan temple complex is being used by the local Muslim community for commercial purposes.\n\nThe Goraknath Temple which was closed in the 1947 was reopened in 2011 after a court ruling which ordered the Evacuee Trust Property Board to open it. In 2019,the Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said that his government will reclaim and restore 400 temples to Hindus. Following this,the 1,000-Year-Old Shivala Teja Singh temple in Sialkot(which was closed for 72 Years) and a 100-year-old Hindu temple in Balochistan was reopened.\n\n\nIn 2014, a Hindu temple and a dharmashala in Larkana district in Sindh was attacked by a crowd of Muslims. In 2019,three Hindu temples were vandalised in Ghotki district in Sindh over blasphemy accusations.\n\nIn 2020, a Hindu temple in Chachro, Tharparkar district in Sindh was vandalised by miscreants.Miscreants desecrated the idols and set fire to holy scriptures.\n\nSome minor Hindu girls in Pakistan are kidnapped, forcibly converted and married to Muslims, although some cases of Hindu girls defying their families wishes by eloping with Muslim men have been reported as forced conversions by the girls' families. According to the Pakistan Hindu Council, forced conversions remain the foremost reason for the declining population of Hindus in Pakistan. Religious institutions and persons like Abdul Haq (Mitthu Mian) politician and caretaker of Bharachundi Sharif Dargah in Ghotki district and Pir Ayub Jan Sirhindi, the caretaker of Dargah pir sarhandi in Umerkot District support forced conversions and are known to have support and protection of ruling political parties of Sindh. According to the National Commission of Justice and Peace and the Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC) around 1000 non-Muslim minority women are converted to Islam and then forcibly married off. This practice is being reported increasingly in the districts of Tharparkar, Umerkot and Mirpur Khas in Sindh. According to the Amarnath Motumal, the vice chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, every month, an estimated 20 or more Hindu girls are abducted and converted, although exact figures are impossible to gather. In 2014 alone, 265 legal cases of forced conversion were reported mostly involving Hindu girls.\n\nIn November 2016, a bill against forced conversion was passed unanimously by the Sindh Provisional Assembly. However, the bill failed to make it into law as the Governor returned the bill. The Bill was effectively blocked by the Islamist groups and parties like the Council of Islamic Ideology and Jamaat-e-Islami.\n\nIn 2019, a bill against forced conversion was proposed by Hindu politicians in the Sindh assembly, but was turned down by the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party lawmakers.\n\nThere are also Irish Christian missionaries and Ahmadiyya missionaries operating in the Thar region. The Christian and Ahmadi missionaries offer impoverished Hindus schools, health clinics etc. as an inducement for those who convert. Korean Christian missionaries are also very active in Sindh, who have built schools from Badin to Tharparkar. Korean Christian missionaries have allegedly converted more than 1,000 Hindu families in 2012 alone. According to the Sono Kangharani, member of Pakistan Dalit Network, the Korean missionaries have been active in the area from 2011 and these missionaries don't focus on individuals but they convert entire villages. According to him about 200 to 250 Hindu villages were converted in the last two and a half years between 2014 and 2016.\n\nThere has been historical decline of Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism in the areas of Pakistan. This happened for a variety of reasons even as these religions have continued to flourish beyond the eastern frontiers of Pakistan. The region became predominantly Muslim during the rule of Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire. In general, religious conversion was a gradual process, some converted to Islam to gain tax relief, land grant, marriage partners, social and economic advancement, or freedom from slavery and some by force. The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Partition of India. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslims refugees from India migrated to Pakistan. Approximately 4.7 million Hindus and Sikhs moved to India while 6.5 million Muslims settled in Pakistan.\n\nSome Hindus in Pakistan feel that they are treated as second-class citizens and many have continued to migrate to India. According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan data, just around 1,000 Hindu families fled to India in 2013. In May 2014, a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, revealed in the National Assembly of Pakistan that around 5,000 Hindus are migrating from Pakistan to India every year.\n\nThose Pakistani Hindus who have migrated to India allege that Hindu girls are sexually harassed in Pakistani schools and their religious practices are mocked. The Indian government is planning to issue Aadhaar cards and PAN cards to Pakistani Hindu refugees, and simplifying the process by which they can acquire Indian citizenship.\n\nMany Hindus voluntarily convert to Islam for easily getting Watan Cards and National Identification Cards. These converts were also given land and money. For example, 428 poor Hindus in Matli were converted between 2009–11 by the Madrassa Baitul Islam, a Deobandi seminary in Matli, which pays off the debts of Hindus converting to Islam. Another example is the conversion of 250 Hindus to Islam in Chohar Jamali area in Thatta. Conversions are also carried out by Baba Deen Mohammad Shaikh mission which converted 108,000 people to Islam since 1989.\n\nSeparate electorates for Hindus and Christians were established in 1985—a policy originally proposed by Islamist leader Abul A'la Maududi. Christian and Hindu leaders complained that they felt excluded from the county's political process, but the policy had strong support from Islamists. Until 1999, when former military chief Pervez Musharaf overthrew Nawaz Sharif's government, non-Muslims had dual voting rights in the general elections that allowed them to not only vote for Muslim candidates on general seats, but also for their own non-Muslim candidates.\n\nThe Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA), a coalition of Islamist political parties in Pakistan, calls for the increased Islamization of the government and society, specifically taking an anti-Hindu stance. The MMA leads the opposition in the national assembly, held a majority in the NWFP Provincial Assembly, and was part of the ruling coalition in Balochistan. However, some members of the MMA made efforts to eliminate their rhetoric against Hindus.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Babri Masjid demolition, widespread retaliatory riots erupted against Hindus. Mobs attacked scores of Hindu temples across Pakistan. Shops owned by Hindus were also attacked in Sukkur, Sindh. Hindu homes and temples were also attacked in Quetta.\n\nThe rise of Taliban insurgency in Pakistan has been an influential and increasing factor in the persecution of and non-Muslims in Pakistan In July 2010, around 60 members of the minority Hindu community in Karachi were attacked and evicted from their homes following an incident of a Dalit Hindu youth drinking water from a tap near an Islamic Mosque. Between 2011 and 2012, twenty three Hindus were kidnapped for ransom and 13 Hindus were killed as a part of targeted killings of non-Muslims In January 2014, a policeman standing guard outside a Hindu temple at Peshawar was gunned down. Pakistan's Supreme Court has sought a report from the government on its efforts to ensure access for the minority Hindu community to temples – the Karachi bench of the apex court was hearing applications against the alleged denial of access to the members of the minority community.\n\nAccording to the Sustainable Development Policy Institute report, \"Associated with the insistence on the Ideology of Pakistan has been an essential component of hate against India and the Hindus. For the upholders of the Ideology of Pakistan, the existence of Pakistan is defined only in relation to Hindus, and hence the Hindus have to be painted as negatively as possible\".\n\nA 2005 report by the National Commission for Justice and Peace, a non-profit organization in Pakistan, found that Pakistan Studies textbooks in Pakistan have been used to articulate the hatred that Pakistani policy-makers have attempted to inculcate towards the Hindus. \"Vituperative animosities legitimise military and autocratic rule, nurturing a siege mentality. Pakistan Studies textbooks are an active site to represent India as a hostile neighbour\", the report stated. 'The story of Pakistan's past is intentionally written to be distinct from, and often in direct contrast with, interpretations of history found in India. From the government-issued textbooks, students are taught that Hindus are backward and superstitious.' Further the report stated \"Textbooks reflect intentional obfuscation.\"\n\nIn 1975, Islamiat or Islamic studies was made compulsory, resulting that a large number of minority students being forced to study Islamic Studies. In 2015,Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government introduced Ethics as an alternative subject to Islamiat for non-Muslim schoolchildren in the province followed by Sindh in 2016.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.hafsite.org/human-rights-issues/discrimination-and-persecution-plight-hindus-pakistan\n\n\n"}

She is noted for helping to open the field of interior design to women, supporting craftswomen, and for encouraging a new style of American design. She founded both the Society of Decorative Art in New York City (1877) and the New York Exchange for Women's Work (1878).\n\nWheeler was associated with the Colonial Revival, Aesthetic Movement, and the Arts and Crafts Movement throughout her long career, Wheeler was considered a national authority on home decoration. Wheeler is also noted for designing the interior of the Women's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, IL.\n\nCandace Wheeler was born Candace Thurber on March 24, 1827 in Delhi, New York west of the Catskill Mountains. Her parents were Abner Gilman Thurber (1797–1860) and Lucy (née Dunham) Thurber (1800–1892). Candace was the third born of eight siblings: Lydia Ann Thurber (1824-?), Charles Stewart Thurber (1826–1888), Horace Thurber (1828–1899), Lucy Thurber (1834–1893), Millicent Thurber (1837–1838), Abner Dunham Thurber (1839–1899), and Francis Beattie Thurber (1842–1907).\n\nWheeler led a happy a childhood, though she expressed annoyance at how their father raised them \"a hundred years behind the time\" (6, Peck and Irish). Her father was strictly Presbyterian but also a strict abolitionist. He ensured that the family never used any product made by slaves. So concerned was this endeavor of Abner, that the family used homemade maple sugar instead of cane sugar and linen woven from flax they grew on their farm instead of southern cotton. Looking back, Candace was convinced their farm had been a stop on the underground railroad.\n\nCandace attended an \"infant school\" where at age six she stitched her first sampler. Around age 11 or 12, Candace began attending Delaware Academy in Delhi.\n\nIn 1876, Wheeler visited the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. She was deeply impressed by the Royal School of Art Needlework's display. But it was not the artistry of the needlework that inspired Wheeler. She was interested in needlework as a woman-run business that benefited women. \n\nWhile still in Philadelphia, Wheeler conceived of an American version of the Royal School that would include \"all articles of feminine manufacture.\" In her opinion, this model could help \"educated\" but impoverished women. Years later, in a letter to her niece, Wheeler described herself as \"jumping at the possibility of work for the army of helpless women of N.Y. who were ashamed to beg & untrained to work.\"\n\nWheeler founded the Society of Decorative Arts in New York in 1877. Other founding members included Louis Comfort Tiffany, John LaFarge, and Elizabeth Custer. The Society was meant to help women support themselves through handicrafts such as needlework, sewing, and other decorative arts. The Society had a special focus on the thousands of women who were left indigent at the end of the Civil War. Wheeler called on prominent New York society matrons to support a shop in which the high-quality, custom-made goods could be sold to produce income. The Society had five hundred subscribers within three years.\n\nLeading artists were hired to teach or judge exhibits at the Society of Decorative Arts in New York. Wheeler helped to start related societies in Chicago, St. Louis, Hartford, Detroit, Troy, New York and Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIn 1878, Wheeler helped launch the New York Exchange for Women's Work, where women could sell any product that they could manufacture at home, including baked goods and household linens. This new enterprise served a broader range of women as no artistic skills were required. The Exchange opened in March 1878 with a consignment sale of thirty items at the home of Exchange co-founder Mary Choate. In April, the exchange moved to a rented facility and by May it as successful enough to employ to part-time sales women. In its first year, the Exchange paid out nearly $14,000 in commissions. By 1891, there were at least seventy-two Exchanges across the United States.\n\nIn 1879, Wheeler resigned from the Society of Decorative Arts.\n\nIn 1879, Candace Wheeler and Louis Comfort Tiffany co-founded the interior-decorating firm of Tiffany & Wheeler. The firm decorated a number of significant late-19th-century houses and public buildings, including the Veterans’ Room of the Seventh Regiment Armory, the Madison Square Theatre, the Union League Club, the George Kemp house, and the drawing room of the Cornelius Vanderbilt II house. The firm also designed the interior of Mark Twain’s house.\n\nTiffany & Wheeler as also known as Tiffany & Co., Associated Artists. The partners were Louis Comfort Tiffany, Candace Wheeler, William Pringle Mitchell, and Lockwood de Forest.\n\nIn 1883, Wheeler formed her own textile firm, involving by women only, under the name Associated Artists. The firm produced a wide range of textile goods including tapestries and curtains. Associated Artists was particularly well-known for its \"changeable\" silks. Woven out of two threads, these fabrics changed color depending on the light.\n\nWealthy customers could create custom fabrics. Andrew Carnegie commissioned a Scotch thistle damask for his own use. Lillie Langtry ordered a floral silver-grey brocade portiere for her bedroom.\n\nAt the same time, Wheeler took care to make sure that her products were available to a wide audience by creating machine-ready patterns and reflecting American designs and local plant forms. Between 1884 and 1894, Cheney Brothers turned out more than 500 fabrics for Associated Artists that were sold throughout the United States at all levels of the market.\n\nAssociated Artists's signature tapestry style was a combination of loom and tapestry weaving that Wheeler had invented. The technique made the stitches practical invisible and created a visually smoother tapestry.\n\nIn 1892, In coordination with her husband and brother, Wheeler founded an artist colony in the Catskill Mountains called Onteora. The colony was attractive to single women who could show their skills in art or writing to gain finances, it eventually owned two thousand acres of land.\n\nIn 1893, at the age of 66, Wheeler was asked to serve as the interior decorator of the Woman's Building at the Chicago World's Fair, and to organize the State of New York's applied arts exhibition there. The Woman's Building was overseen by Bertha Palmer and designed by architect Sophia Hayden. Artists featured in the Woman's Building included Alice Rideout, Mary Cassatt, and Wheeler's daughter Dora Wheeler Keith. The building was filled with exhibitions of women's fine arts, crafts, industrial products and regional and ethnic specialties from around the world.\n\nPanels lined the grand rotunda of the Woman's Building listing <nowiki>\"</nowiki>golden names of women who in past and present centuries have done honor to the human race,<nowiki>\"</nowiki> a roll-call echoed in the names on the floor of Judy Chicago<nowiki>'s 1979 \"</nowiki>The Dinner Party.<nowiki>\"</nowiki>\n\nWheeler spent much of her later life writing books and articles on decorating and the textile arts, as well as fiction. She published her last book in 1921.\n\nOn a trip to New York City in 1843, Candace met Thomas Mason Wheeler (1818-1895). Within a year, they married. Eventually, the couple had four children:\n\n\nWheeler died on August 5, 1923 at the age of 96.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2127305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127305", "title": "Wheaton Aston", "text": "Wheaton Aston\n\nWheaton Aston is a small village in Staffordshire, England about 9 miles south west of Stafford and 7 miles west of Cannock. It is located beside Bridge 19 of the Shropshire Union Canal. The civil parish is called Lapley, Stretton and Wheaton Aston.\n\nIt has a population of several thousand according to the latest British Survey. It has good transport links making it an ideal commuter village to the large cities of the English Midlands. Junction 12 of the M6 motorway is only 5 miles away, providing quick access to Birmingham, Walsall and Wolverhampton, while close proximity to the M54, A449 and A5 provides easy access to Stafford, Cannock, Telford and Shrewsbury.\n\nThe first known reference to Wheaton Aston is in the Domesday book where the parish of Lapley is mentioned and includes other local settlements.\n\nIn 1777 the first major event in the village happened when a fire burnt down over half of the village. This is known locally as the 'Great Fire'.\n\nUp to the 18th century, Wheaton Aston was regarded as something of a spa due to the existence of a mineral spring in one of the gardens.\n\nIn the 1830s, Thomas Telford built the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction canal (now known as the Shropshire Union Canal) through the edge of the village, bringing a lot of people and trade into the village. This was due to the canal being the main through route between Liverpool and London.\n\nDuring World War II the village had an operational airfield roughly 2 miles north of the village, which is now used as farm land, however the buildings (control tower etc.) are still present but derelict.\n\nThe last large event to occur in the village was the introduction of the sewers into the village in the 1960s and 1970s which allowed the village to grow in size very quickly, and resulted in many new housing estates.\n\nThere are a pair of moles feet from 1902 on display in the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford that were carried in the pocket of an old man from Wheaton Aston as a cure against toothache.\n\nOne of the village's claims to fame is that it is the most northerly point in the UK where the snake's head fritillary can be found growing in the wild. Locally the flower is known by the name \"folfallarum\". In years gone by it used to be tradition that on the first Sunday on May, the villagers would all go out and pick the flowers. This tradition is what caused the flower to become the village's unofficial emblem, used on things like the local school uniforms.\n\nNowadays the area where the flower grows, known as Mottey Meadows, is run by English Nature, to protect the flower.\n\nAlthough in the heart of the South Staffordshire countryside there are many amenities for the local population including two pubs, The Hartley Arms and the Coach and Horses (which also provides accommodation for a cafe/sandwich shop), Wheaton Aston and Lapley Recreation Ground, post office, paper shop, general store, a garage-cum-chandlery-cum-hardware shop (Turners), a motor engineers (Hinsley's) and a couple of farms (The Bridge and Whitegates) who also sell their produce direct to the public.\n\nThere is one school in the village, St. Mary's CE(C) First School, which has a total intake of roughly 100 children.\n\nThere is currently one church and one chapel in the village.\n\nThere has been a church on the current site in the centre of the village since the 14th century. This original wooden church was one of the few buildings to survive of the Great Fire in 1777. However, due to disrepair, this church was demolished and a new stone church was built in 1857. This was then extended in 1894, and is the church still currently standing. All of the windows were made in a medieval style by the renowned Victorian master of stained glass, Charles Eamer Kempe.\n\nThe Zion chapel was built in 1814 and was established as a 'Congregational church'. However, when the Congregational and Presbyterian churches combined they decides to join The Evangelical Fellowship of Congregational Churches (E.F.C.C.) Worldwide so that they could continue preaching the same as before.\n\nAt one time it had a music festival, the Wheaton Aston Festival. It ran for nine years but closed after the original organisers moved onto other things.\n\n\n"}

It is the proper reading on All Souls' Day (normally November 2) for all souls in Purgatory, and can be a votive office on other days when said for a particular decedent. The work is composed of different psalms, scripture, prayers and other parts, divided into The Office of Readings, Lauds, Daytime Prayer, and Vespers (with Compline taken from the Sunday hour of Compline).\n\nThe current office, according to the 2000 \"Liturgia Horarum\" (Liturgy of the Hours) \"editio typica altera\" (second typical edition) includes the normal cycle of a typical ferial office, namely an Office of Readings (Matins), Lauds, Daytime Prayer (Terce, Sext, or None), and Vespers. The final hour of Compline is taken from Sunday. The Office of Readings includes Psalms 40 [39]: 2-14, 17-18 (this psalm selection is split between verses 9 and 10 into two sections, to keep the character of threefold cycle of Psalms for the hour); and 42 [41]. These psalms are followed by two longer lessons which are variable and come from one of multiple options. Lauds includes Psalm 51 [50], the Canticle of Ezechias (Hezekiah) (verses 15-16 are not included), and Psalm 146 [145] or 150. These are followed by a short lesson, a responsory, the \"Benedictus\" and the preces. Daytime Prayer consists of Psalms 70 [69], 85 [84], and 86 [85]. These are followed by a short lesson and a versicle which vary depending on which of the little hours (Terce, Sext, or None) are being used for Daytime Prayer. Vespers includes Psalms 121 [120], 130 [129], and a canticle from Phil 2:6-11. This is followed by a short lesson, a responsory, the \"Magnificat\", and the preces. The hour of Compline is taken from Sunday after Second Vespers.\n\nThis office, as it exists in the Roman Liturgy up to and including the current 1960 Roman Breviary, is composed of First Vespers, Mass, Matins, and Lauds. The editor is not known, but the office as it existed before the alternative was no older than from 7th or 8th century. A well known refrain from the cycle is \"Timor mortis conturbat me\", \"The fear of death confounds me\" or, more colloquially, \"I am scared to death of dying\". The word dirge comes from it.\n\nThe Vespers of the older form of the office comprise Psalms 114.1–9 (116), 119 (120), 120 (121), 129 (130), and 137 (138), with the \"Magnificat\" and the preces. The Matins, composed like those of feast days, have three nocturns, each consisting of three psalms and three lessons; the Lauds, as was usual until 1911, had three psalms (Psalms 62 (63) and 66 (67) united are counted as one) and a canticle (that of Ezechias), the three psalms Laudate, and the \"Benedictus\". Pope Pius X's reform of the Breviary removed Psalms 66, 149, and 150 from being said at Lauds every day, and this reform included the Office of the Dead. The office differs in important points from the other offices of the Roman Liturgy. It has not the Little Hours, the Second Vespers, or the Compline. In this respect it resembles the ancient vigils, which began at eventide (First Vespers), continued during the night (Matins), and ended at the dawn (Lauds); Mass followed and terminated the vigil of the feast. The absence of the introduction, \"\"Deus in adjutorium\"\", of the hymns, absolution, blessings, and of the doxology in the psalms also recall ancient times, when these additions had not yet been made. The psalms are chosen not in their serial order, as in the Sunday Office or the Roman ferial Office, but because certain verses, which serve as antiphons, seem to allude to the state of the dead. The use of some of these psalms in the funeral service is of high antiquity, as appears from passages in St. Augustine and other writers of the fourth and fifth centuries. The lessons from Job, so suitable for the Office of the Dead, were also read in very early days at funeral services. The responses, too, deserve notice, especially the response \"\"Libera me, Domine, de viis inferni qui portas æreas confregisti et visitasti inferum et dedisti eis lumen . . . qui erant in poenis . . . advenisti redemptor noster\"\" etc. This is one of the few texts in the Roman Liturgy alluding to Christ's descent into hell. It is also a very ancient composition (see Cabrol, \"\"La descente du Christ aux enfers\"\" in \"Rassegna Gregor.\", May and June, 1909).\n\nThe \"\"Libera me de morte æterna\"\", which is found more complete in the ancient manuscripts, dates also from an early period (see Cabrol in \"Dict. d'archéol. et de liturgie\", s. v. Absoute). Mgr Batiffol remarks that it is not of Roman origin, but it is very ancient (Hist. du brév., 148). The distinctive character of the Mass, its various epistles, its tract, its offertory in the form of a prayer, the communion (like the offertory) with versicles, according to the ancient custom, and the sequence \"Dies Iræ\" (q.v.; concerning its author see also BURIAL), it is impossible to dwell upon here. The omission of the Alleluia, and the kiss of peace is also characteristic of this mass. There was a time when the Alleluia was one of the chants customary at funeral services (see Dict. d'archéol. et de liturgie, s. v. Alleluia, I, 1235). Later it was looked upon exclusively as a song of joy, and was omitted on days of penance (e.g. Lent and ember week), sometimes in Advent, and at all funeral ceremonies. It is replaced to-day by a tract. A treatise of the 8th-9th century published by Muratori (Liturg. Rom. vet., II, 391) shows that the Alleluia was then suppressed. The omission of the kiss of peace at the Mass is probably because that ceremony preceded the distribution of the Eucharist to the faithful and was a preparation for it, so, as communion is not given at the Mass for the Dead, the kiss of peace was suppressed.\n\nNot to speak of the variety of ceremonies of the Mozarabic, Ambrosian, or Oriental liturgies, even in countries where the Roman liturgy prevailed, there were many variations. The lessons, the responses, and other formulæ were borrowed from various sources; certain Churches included in this office the Second Vespers and Complin; in other places, instead of the lessons of our Roman Ritual, they read St. Augustine, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Ecclesiasticus, Osee, Isaiah, Daniel, etc. The responses varied likewise; many examples may be found in Martène and the writers cited below in the bibliography. It is fortunate that the Roman Church preserved carefully and without notable change this office, which, like that of Holy Week, has retained for us in its archaic forms the memory and the atmosphere of a very ancient liturgy. The Mozarabic Liturgy possesses a very rich funeral ritual. Dom Férotin in his \"Liber Ordinum\" (pp. 107 sqq.) has published a ritual (probably the oldest extant), dating back possibly to the 7th century. He has also published a large number of votive masses of the dead. For the Ambrosian Liturgy, see Magistretti, \"Manuale Ambrosianum\", I (Milan, 1905), 67; for the Greek Ritual, see Burial, pp. 77–8. In addition, the Anglican Church and Lutheran Church retained \"The Office of the Dead\" after the Reformation.\n\nThe Office of the Dead has been attributed at times to St. Isidore, to St. Augustine, to St. Ambrose, and even to Origen. There is no foundation for these assertions. In its 20th century form, while it has some very ancient characteristics, it cannot be older than the 7th or even 8th century. Its authorship is discussed at length in the dissertation of Horatius de Turre. Some writers attribute it to Amalarius, others to Alcuin (see Pierre Batiffol, \"Hist. du Brév.\", 181-92; and for the opposing view, Bäumer-Biron, \"Hist. du Brév.\", II, 37). These opinions are more probable, but are not as yet very solidly established. Amalarius speaks of the Office of the Dead, but seems to imply that it existed before his time (\"De Eccles. officiis\", IV, xlii, in P. L., CV, 1238). He alludes to the \"Agenda Mortuorum\" contained in a sacramentary, but nothing leads us to believe that he was its author. Alcuin is also known for his activity in liturgical matters, and we owe certain liturgical compositions to him; but there is no reason for considering him the author of this office (see Cabrol in \"Dict. d'archéol. et de liturgie\", s. v. Alcuin). In the Gregorian Antiphonary we do find a mass and an office in agenda mortuorum, but it is admitted that this part is an addition; a fortiori this applies to the Gelasian. The Maurist editors of St. Gregory are inclined to attribute their composition to Albinus and Etienne of Liège (Microl., lx). But if it is impossible to trace the office and the mass in their actual form beyond the 9th or 8th century, it is notwithstanding certain that the prayers and a service for the dead existed long before that time. We find them in the 5th, 4th, and even in the 3rd and 2nd century. Pseudo-Dionysius, Sts. Gregory of Nyssa, Jerome, and Augustine, Tertullian, and the inscriptions in the catacombs afford a proof of this (see Burial, III, 76; PRAYERS FOR THE DEAD; Cabrol, \"La prière pour les morts\" in \"Rev. d'apologétique\", 15 September 1909, pp. 881–93).\n\nThe Office of the Dead was composed originally to satisfy private devotion to the dead, and at first had no official character. Even in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, it was recited chiefly by the religious orders (the Cluniacs, Cistercians, Carthusians), like the Little Office of Our Lady (see Guyet, loc. cit., 465). Later it was prescribed for all clerics and became obligatory whenever a ferial office was celebrated. It has even been said that it was to remove the obligation of reciting it that the feasts of double and semi-double rite were multiplied, for it could be omitted on such days (Bäumer-Biron, op. cit., II, 198). The reformed Breviary of St. Pius V assigned the recitation of the Office of the Dead to the first free day in the month, the Mondays of Advent and Lent, to some vigils, and ember days. Even then it was not obligatory, for the Bull \"\"Quod a nobis\"\" of the same pope merely recommends it earnestly, like the Office of Our Lady and the Penitential Psalms, without imposing it as a duty (Van der Stappen, \"Sacra Liturgia\", I, Malines, 1898, p. 115). At the present time, it is obligatory on the clergy only on the feast of All Souls and in certain mortuary services. Some religious orders (Carthusians, Cistercians etc.) have preserved the custom of reciting it in choir on the days assigned by the Bull \"Quod a nobis\".\n\n\n"}

In Serbian is also known as \"Srpsko Vojvodstvo\" (Serbian Cyrillic: Српско Војводство, German: \"Serbische Woiwodschaft\"; \"Serbian Voivodeship\"), \"Srpska Vojvodovina\" (Serbian Cyrillic: Српска Војводовина; \"Serbian Vojvodovina\") and \"Vojvodovina Srbija\" (Serbian Cyrillic: Војводовина Србија; \"Vojvodovina of Serbia\").\n\nDuring the 1848 Revolution, the Hungarians demanded independence from the Austrian Empire. However, they did not recognize the national rights of other nationalities which lived in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary in that time, so Serbs of Vojvodina took action to separate from the Kingdom of Hungary (which was at that time part of Habsburg Austria).\n\nWishing to express their national individuality and confronted with new Hungarian authorities, Serbs declared the constitution of the \"Serbian Vojvodina\" (Serbian Duchy) at the May Assembly in Sremski Karlovci (May 13–15, 1848). The Serbian Vojvodina consisted of Srem (Syrmia), Bačka (Batschka), Banat, and Baranja (Branau) regions.\n\nThe Serbs also formed a political alliance with the Kingdom of Croatia \"based on freedom and perfect equality\". They also recognized the Romanian nationality. The metropolitan of Sremski Karlovci, Josif Rajačić, was elected for patriarch, while Stevan Šupljikac for the first duke (voivod). A National committee was formed as the new government of \"Serbian Vojvodina\". Instead of the old feudal regime, a new reign was founded based on the national boards with the Head Serbian National Board presiding.\n\nBy 1840 data, Serbs formed relative majority of 49.1% in Vojvodina (compared to absolute majority of 51.1% in 1828). Besides Serbs, these areas were also populated by some other ethnic groups such as Hungarians, Germans, Romanians and Croats. The new Hungarian government replied to the Serb political actions by the use of force: on June 12, 1848, a war between Serbs and Hungarians started. Austria took the side of the Kingdom of Hungary at first, while Serbs were aided by volunteers from the Principality of Serbia. A consequence of this war was the expansion of the conservative factions.\n\nIn early 1849, when the Austrian army lost battle to the Hungarian hussars, the feudal and clerical circles of Vojvodina formed an alliance with Austria. Serb troops from Vojvodina then joined the Habsburg army and helped in crushing the revolution in Hungary. With the help of Imperial Russia, the forces of reaction smothered the revolution in the summer of 1849, defeating Hungarian national movement in the Habsburg monarchy.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Hungarian revolution, by a decision of the Austrian emperor, in November 1849, an Austrian crownland known as \"Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar\" was formed as the successor of Serbian Vojvodina. However, Serbs were not fully satisfied with the new voivodeship, which was more ethnically mixed and included ethnic Romanian eastern parts of Banat, but excluded some areas with Serb majority.\n\nThe first capital of Serbian Vojvodina was in Sremski Karlovci. It was later moved to Zemun, Veliki Bečkerek (today known as Zrenjanin), and Temišvar (Timișoara).\n\nThe coat-of-arms of the Serbian Vojvodina was essentially the Austrian Habsburg imperial arms, with the coat-of-arms of the Serbs (Serbian cross, with four Cyrillic letters \"S\", on the chests of the black eagle. The bearer of the Serbian arms was the Austrian black eagle, instead of the Serbian white one, in order to show the fidelity of the newly established Voivodship to the Imperial Court in Vienna. The coat-of-arms was simply added to the Serbian national tricolour. Thus the flag differed from the flag of the Principality of Serbia, which had a different arms in the middle of its state flag.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Located on the Potaro River in the Kaieteur National Park, it sits in a section of the Amazon rainforest included in the Potaro-Siparuni region of Guyana. It is 226 metres (741 ft) high when measured from its plunge over a sandstone and conglomerate cliff to the first break. It then flows over a series of steep cascades that, when included in the measurements, bring the total height to 251 metres (822 ft). While many falls have greater height, few have the combination of height and water volume, and Kaieteur is among the most powerful waterfalls in the world with an average flow rate of 663 cubic metres per second (23,400 cubic feet per second).\n\nKaieteur Falls is about four times higher than Niagara Falls, on the border between Canada and the United States, and about twice the height of Victoria Falls, on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe in Africa. It is a single drop waterfall.\n\nUpriver from the falls, the Potaro Plateau stretches out to the distant escarpment of the Pakaraima Mountains. The Potaro River empties into the Essequibo River which is one of the longest and widest rivers in South America and the longest river in Guyana.\n\nThe falls were rediscovered by Europeans in 1870 by a party led by Charles Barrington Brown, a British geologist appointed as a government surveyor to the colony of British Guiana. Brown and his partner James Sawkins had arrived in Georgetown in 1867, and while they did some of their mapping and preparation of geological reports together, some work was performed in separate expeditions, and Sawkins was taking a break from his work at the time of Brown's discovery of Kaieteur. At this point, Brown did not have time to investigate Kaieteur Falls closer, so he returned one year later to make comprehensive measurements.\n\nBrown’s book \"Canoe and Camp life in British Guiana\" was published in 1876. Two years later, in 1878, he published \"Fifteen Thousand Miles on the Amazon and its tributaries\".\n\nAccording to a Patamona Indian legend, Kaieteur Falls was named for Kai, a chief, or Toshao who acted to save his people by paddling over the falls in an act of self-sacrifice to Makonaima, the great spirit.\n\nAnother legend though was told to Brown by Amerindians in the night of discovery of falls: Kaieteur has been named after an unpleasant old man who was placed in a boat and shoved in the fall by his relatives. Thus the fall was named \"Kaieteur\", which means \"old-man-fall\".\n\nKaieteur Falls is a major tourist attraction in Guyana. It is in Kaieteur National Park in the center of Guyana's rainforest.\n\nThe park is served by Kaieteur International Airport, about a 15-minute walk from the top of Kaieteur falls, with frequent flights to Ogle Airport and Cheddi Jagan International Airport in Georgetown.\n\nKaieteur Falls is featured in:\n\n\n\n"}

Peck, Pomfret's Coat of Arms is derived from that of the Lords of Pontefract Castle in the town of Pomfret in West Yorkshire, England. In Elizabethan times, the castle and the surrounding medieval market town of Pontefract were referred to as \"Pomfret\". England's King Richard II died in the castle, by starvation or murder, and the castle has a significant role William Shakespeare's plays \"The Life and Death of King Richard the Second\", V.i, V.iii, and the penultimate scene V.v which is set entirely in Pomfret Castle; and \"The Tragedy of King Richard the Third\", II.iv, III.i, III.ii, III.iii, all set in Pomfret Castle, and V.iii.\n\nPomfret's 13th century stained glass windows\n\nPomfret's Clark memorial chapel contains fine stained glass windows known to have been created by American firms Heaton, Butler & Bayne; Connick Associates, and Nicola D’Ascenzo for the chapel, completed in 1908. However, the ten-foot-high rose window above the chapel doorway and two of the arched-top, oblong windows along the walls are apparently from the 13th century cathedral, Saint Julien of Tours, on the Loire river in France. Research indicates these three extraordinary windows were removed from St. Julien during one of its many expansions. The arch tops on the two oblong windows were added at a later date to match the others in the chapel. The ancient windows were donated to Pomfret in 1947 in memory of John Grant Fitch ‘42, an alumnus killed in 1945 in Germany during World War II. They are recorded as having been imported to the U.S. in 1904 and offered to New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, but were declined due to the extensive restoration needed. They were subsequently auctioned by the Parke-Bernet Galleries in New York to an anonymous bidder, restored by Reynolds, Francis & Rohnstock of Boston, and installed in Clark Chapel in 1949.\n\nErnest Flagg's architecture for Pomfret\n\nIn the first decade of the 1900s, Pomfret was transformed from a collection of \"vernacular buildings—most were Colonial Revival frame structures adapted to school use—to a planned institution. The building campaign was financed principally by two patrons: Edward Walker Clark, one of three sons of the Singer [Manufacturing Company] heir, Alfred Corning Clark, and Frederick G. Bourne,\" then president of that company. By 1906, Flagg had designed a master plan, using the casual relationship among the original buildings and their New England town green style arrangement as his guide for a formal institutional complex. \"Flagg’s master plan reinforced the enduring colonial image of the New England village green.\" The design set a School Building as anchor for a series of semidetached pavilion style dormitories with a connecting open arcade. The Chapel was appropriately located to be visible from the main road, while the gymnasium and infirmary were arranged along the slope of the hill that led to the playing fields. The pavilion arrangement reflected the influence of Thomas Jefferson's design for the University of Virginia. \"The dynamic focus of the scheme was the arcade. It acted as a spine and artery, linking the dormitories together while providing covered access to classrooms in the School Building, a Jeffersonian concept that distinguishes both Monticello and UVA. Regrettably, the architectural virtues of the arcade were abandoned in favor of practicality, and in 1957, it was walled-in during dormitory remodeling.\"\n\n\"The School Building with its belfry and white appliqué ornament, similar to the Colonial Revival structures of the former campus, as well as the dormitories and infirmary, maintained a domestic scale and architectural character.\" For the Chapel, commissioned by Edward Clark in 1907 as a memorial to his son George Newhall Clark (1885–1906), a Pomfret alumnus who died while attending Harvard University, Flagg chose Norman architecture as an appropriate model and emulated the rich textures of the unpolished stone-work characteristic of that style.\n\nFollowing a visit to the campus in 1910, when construction was nearing completion, Flagg compared Pomfret to his design of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, remarking, \"These buildings are certainly among the best things I have done. The school is better architecturally than Annapolis.\" While his design for Annapolis had been repeatedly altered by the Navy during construction, the work at Pomfret scrupulously followed his design.\n\nConvinced that American architects should return to eighteenth century forms, both American and French, to revive the lost thread of Renaissance classicism, \"Flagg saw Pomfret School as part of the process of evolution that would contribute to the creation of a national style of architecture.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2127344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127344", "title": "Grey dune", "text": "Grey dune\n\nGrey dunes are fixed, stable sand dunes that are covered by a continuous layer of herbaceous vegetation. These dunes are typically located 50–100 meters from the ocean shore and are found on the landward side of foredunes (also known as yellow dunes). Grey dunes are named for their characteristic grey color which is a result of the ground cover of lichen combined with a top soil layer of humus.\n\nGrey dunes are formed when pioneer species inhabit embryo dunes and begin a successional process toward dune stabilization and soil formation. Pioneer plants capture saltating sand grains carried by the wind and deposit them to continue build up the dune. Grey dunes are then formed after the root structures of pioneering plants stabilize foredunes. Sand stabilization allows for dead plant material to be decomposed within the soil, adding nutrients and water-retention abilities to the soil. As soil starts to slowly form, new plant species colonize the stable dunes ultimately developing more extensive root structures and plant diversity. When the dune has become continuously vegetated, lichen and moss grows in the understory, providing a water-repellent surface that reduces erosion (through rainfall and wind), this results in the official formation of the grey dune.\n\nPluvial processes dominate the geomorphology of grey dunes, with rain splash and slope wash being the most common processes taking place. Erosion can take place in the form of rain splash and slope wash. Rain splash occurs when a raindrop impacts the bare soil surface and disperses soil particles to the surrounding area. However, as grey dunes begin to develop, lichens and mosses protect the dune surfaces and dissipate raindrop impacts. Slope wash (overland flow) is particularly evident in sparsely vegetated dune slopes. Slope wash occurs when rainfall infiltration is impeded, which can result in rills and alluvial fans.\n\nDepending on the sand composition, a grey dune will become either acidic or calcareous. An acidic soil substrate will form if the sand is composed completely of quartz grains. Older grey dunes can also exhibit acidic conditions if there has been enough rainfall to leach out the soil nutrients. Calcareous soil substrates form when seashells decompose to create a lime-rich environment. The vegetation on grey dunes is dependent on the pH of the soil substrate.\n\nMany rare and endangered plant species can be found within grey dune ecosystems, providing niche habitats for animals and insects. A wide variety of orchids, grasses, and lichens are found in grey dune plant communities but species will depend on locations throughout the European continent.\n\nGrey dunes are found along much of the European coast and along large, inland bodies of water. Broadly speaking, they can be found along the Celtic, Baltic, and North Seas, the Eastern and Mid Atlantic coast, the Western and Eastern Mediterranean coasts, and the Black sea.\n\nGrey dunes are highly susceptible to change from both natural and human-induced events. Since the 1960s, grey dune ecosystems have declined from the encroachment of grass and shrub species, and more recently, by the invasion by the alien invasive Heath Star Moss (Campylopus introflexus). Causes of the encroachment have been related to large-scale sand dune stabilization, high nitrogen deposition from the vegetation, and a decline in rabbit populations within the dunes. Grass and shrub encroachment has resulted in the fragmentation of grey dune landscapes (and overall reduction in habitat), a loss of biodiversity, and a decline of endangered and rare species that are endemic to grey dunes.\n\n"}

Mexico City proved a challenging site since it was 2,300 meters above sea level, resulting in 30% less oxygen in the air. The horses at the 1955 Pan American Games, which was also held in Mexico City, arrived a few weeks before the Games to adjust, but had difficulty in the competition. However, racehorses that competed at the same location and who were shipped in the day before, and left the day after the race, performed fine. It was discovered that although horses would adjust immediately to the high altitude during the first few days after arrival, they showed weakness and decreased performance around Day 10, which continued to Day 20. Therefore, nations were advised to ship in horses 3–4 weeks before the competition, which would allow them time to recover from the long travel, as well as adjust to the difference in altitude. Argentina, Ireland, and the USSR were the first to ship horses over, who arrived mid-September. France and Germany were the last countries to send their horses, who arrived 28 September 20 days before the competition was to start.\n\n125 entries (including 22 women) from 18 nations competed: Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, German Democratic Republic (GDR), France, Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Soviet Union, Switzerland, and the USA. The youngest participant was Yevgeny Kuzin from the Soviet Union at 20 years old, while the oldest rider was Lorna Johnstone from Great Britain at 66 years old.\n\nThe 1968 Games timed the equestrian events manually and electronically, but for the first time the electronic time was considered official.\n\n51 riders from 16 countries contested the team and individual competitions. The 14 obstacle course for the team competition had 17 efforts, and was measured at 631 meters in length. However, only 4 of 87 rounds were within the 96 second time, prompting some to believe that the course was incorrectly measured and was really 693 meters in length. The individual competition consisted of 3 courses. The first was a 750-meter course. Round B was similar to a puissance course, with its major obstacle being a 1.70 meters high and 2.20 meters wide oxer. Round C was a 370-meter jump off.\n\nThe Irish Team had tough luck this year, after their first rider on course, Diana Conolly-Carew, was eliminated. Due to miscommunication, the Irish chef de’équipe was told that his entire team had been eliminated. Therefore, the horse of second rider Ada Matheson was sent back to the stable, so was not ready when she was called, eliminating her from the competition. The final rider, Ned Campion, later rode, but with two of the riders eliminated the team was also eliminated.\n\nThe Canadian show jumping team won the final event of the Mexico City Olympics when it captured the Team Show jumping contest at the Estadio Olympico which guaranteed a \nworldwide television audience. Canada would not win their next Summer Olympics gold medal until 1984.\n\n8 full teams competed in the dressage event, with 3 riders to a team. Additionally there were 2 individual riders from Mexico, making a total of 26 riders from 9 nations competing. The 1968 Games Grand Prix dressage test had 33 movements and lasted 12 minutes 30 seconds. It was judged by men from Chile, France, and the Netherlands, since none of these countries had riders competing. Germany and the USSR had 2 riders each in the top 4, earning them gold and silver team medals. Josef Neckermann and his mount Mariano were in first after the Grand Prix with 948 points, well ahead of Ivan Kizimov and Ikhor (908 points) and Reiner Klimke and Dux (896 points). These three riders, along with 4 others that made it into the ride-off for individual medals, performed a shortened (6 minute, 45 second) test. However, Kizimov rode a great test for 664 points, compared to Neckermann's 598, allowing him to pull ahead for the individual gold medal.\n\nThe eventing cross-country at the 1968 Olympic Games was notoriously difficult, and today would not be acceptable for competition. Originally Oaxtepoc was chosen as the site for the cross-country course, but between the footing (very rocky) and the climate (hot and humid), the organizers decided to move the course to the golf club of Avandaro in the Valle de Bravo. Although it was at higher altitude (1,800 meters vs Oaxtepoc's 1,450 meters), it had a mild climate with a cool breeze. However, it was also known for intense rainfall from October to March, a fact that was ignored and which resulted in very serious difficulties for the competitors.\n\n30 of the 49 riders managed to complete Mario Becerril's 35 obstacle course before a heavy rain fell. Although it lasted only 30 minutes, the penultimate obstacle, a 2 meter wide stream, became 12 meters in width and flooded the entire take off point for the horses. In addition to the trouble caused by that fence, there were two equine fatalities which occurred before the rain: the USSR's Ballerina and the Irish eventer Loughlin. When all horses had completed, Jean-Jacques Guyon, Jim Wofford and Pavel Deev were in the top three with less than a 10-point margin between them.\nThe show-jumping phase also took its toll, after Wofford fell off Kilkenny and dropped into 6th. Deev was in contention for individual gold, but jumped the wrong fence and was eliminated. This allowed Guyon to move up to the gold medal spot, followed by British rider Derek Allhusen on Lochinvar and American Michael Page on Foster.\n\n"}

Therefore, Yvetot means 'property of Yvo'.\n\nThe lords of Yvetot bore the title of king from the 15th until the middle of the 16th century, their petty monarchy being popularized in one of Béranger's songs. In 1592, Henry IV here defeated the troops of the Catholic League.\n\nThe town's prosperity was linked to strong commerce, developed as early as the 17th century, thanks to its fiscal statutes and to cotton spinning, which saw massive expansion after 1794. In the 19th century, the town developed fabric production.\nUntil 1926, Yvetot had been chef-lieu of the old arrondissement of Yvetot, and a sub_prefecture. During this period of reorganisation, it lost its status of sub-prefecture.\nIn World War II, Yvetot was practically razed in 1940 by the Germans.

Maximum length is about .\n\nThese snakes are known for their long, slender bodies and very large heads. Their pupils are very distinct from other snakes. Most snakes found around the world are known to have very poor vision and rely mostly on their smell and vibrations to detect signs of prey and predators. Arboreal snakes have much better vision among other classes of snakes. Blunthead tree snakes on the other hand, have vertical slits for pupils which allow for the snake to look down. This trait is what give the blunthead tree snake such an advantage over other snakes. Their eyes make up approximately 26% of its head.\n\nThe ventral surface, or stomach, of the snake is mostly white while the dorsal surface, or top, is a light or pale brown with lateral dark brown patches that begin at the head and continue down the length of the snakes’ body. The northern and southern populations of blunthead tree snakes exhibit different sexual dimorphism, the existence of two different traits of a species in the same population. For examples, northern males have a slightly longer tail whereas the southern populations have a smaller tail. In some regions females typically have a much larger head than the males.\n\nBlunthead tree snakes are arboreal. They are most often found in low vegetation such as coffee trees or bromeliads. These snakes prefer much cooler and moist areas such as wet forests and rainforests.\n\nBlunthead tree snakes are distributed in Mexico, most of Central America, and parts of South America south to northernmost Argentina. Specifically, they have been recorded in eastern Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, French Guiana, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and northern Argentina.\n\nBecause the blunthead tree snakes are nocturnal, they can be found in a resting coiled position in very shaded areas during the day. At night they forage for food through dense vegetation on the ground up to their resting places in the trees.\n\nBlunthead tree snakes are polygynandrous reptiles. Mating seasons can vary depending on the rainy seasons of their habitat. Some snakes mate year round while some snakes’ mating season may be synced with the wet and rainy seasons of their environment. For example, in areas with long rainy seasons these snakes tend to show a much longer mating season compared to snakes in areas with shorter rainy seasons. These snakes are oviparous or egg-laying animals that have little or no embryonic development within the mother. Some Blunthead tree snakes exhibit continuous reproduction depending on the environment that they live in. However, in an area that has seasonal rainfall, egg laying and hatching positively correlates with the rainy seasons. In Guatemala and Mexico for example, female snake lay their eggs between June and July. These eggs will hatch around July and August, which are the typically rainy seasons in these countries. On the other hand, snakes in Brazil exhibit continuous reproduction. The eggs are laid anywhere from November to January and start to hatch around March throughout August. Both male and female blunthead tree snake reach sexual maturity about 2 years after hatching or at around 620mm SVL (Snout-Vent Length). The female snake can have anywhere from one to three eggs, typically called a clutch, per breeding season depending on the size of the snake, its food habits, and environmental factors. Because these snakes are oviparous the female will leave her eggs after laying them. These animals do not present parental care traits.\n\nBlunthead tree snakes are carnivores that forage primarily at night. They feed mostly on small lizards, frogs, and other reptile eggs. Because the female blunthead tree snakes tend to have larger heads, they are capable of preying on larger reptiles and amphibians. Blunthead tree snakes are rear-fanged and mildly venomous, but is not considered dangerous to humans.\n\n"}

Vuco described his own stage name by saying: \"It was trendy in Croatia for a non-Croats to take a Croatian name so I have deicided to take a Russian name and a Romanian surname\"...\" The title general is used in order to show Živo Blato rehearsal's military drill.\" He explained unusual pseudonyms: \"If a member leaves the band I can replace him by another musician and keep the name\" even though this does not explain their oddness.\n\nIn 2011 two female backing vocalists joined the band, under the stage names Nazifa Gljiva and Trudna Tableta (pregnant pill). Bass player Mala Planina was replaced by a former bass player Gospodin Mr. Rabbit, an old band member. This lineup made a music video for the song \"Otet Ću Te Njemu\" (I will take you away from him) with the lesbian theme. Two female singers on lead vocals make the video even more provocative, but it did not brought much attention. On this occasion Nazifa Gljiva said:\"We recorded a song few months ago in the studio Tetrapak in Split , in the end of March we will be entering a studio in Zagreb where we will continue to record the album with more than a hundred songs.

Since 2010 Vuco has been announcing a new album, that has so far remained unreleased. On the concerts they perform brand new songs, that are expected to be released on the upcoming album. Vuco once again announced the album entitled \"Kad Program Završi\" (When the Schedule is Through) for the beginning of 2012. \n\nIn September 2012 Živo blato released live album entitled \"Live in Zagreb 2012\".\n\n\n\n"}

It was devised by the National Sculpture Factory as part of Cork's tenure as European Capital of Culture in 2005, and was curated by Charles Esche, Art / not art (David Dobz O'Brien and Fergal Gaynor) and Annie Fletcher.\n\nThe stated intention of Cork Caucus was to stimulate the discursive environment of the city of Cork and to provide ways for contemporary art to intervene in social life and political thinking. This coincided with the Capital of Culture status afforded to Cork, which provided a platform for culture to reach beyond its traditional interest groups. It was hoped that this model would impact on future activities and the ongoing cultural and intellectual life of the city.\n\nCork Caucus was an official Cork 2005 European Capital of Culture project and was also supported by the Arts Council's Projects Award, The European Cultural Foundation, The Mondriaan foundation, the Prins Claus Fund, The British Council, The Kingdom of the Netherlands, The I.F.A.(Institut fuer Auslandsbeziehungen e.V.) and The Danish Arts Council's Committee for International Visual Art.\n\nProject partners included Fáilte Ireland, the Evening Echo, The Triskel Arts Centre, Cork Institute of Technology and the South Presentation Convent, Cork.\n\nParticipants included:\nVito Acconci,\nCan Altay,\nIbon Aranberri,\nArt / not art,\nBik Van der Pol,\nCemeti Art Foundation,\nPhil Collins,\nMembers of the Cork Artists' Collective,\nDavid Crawforth,\nShane Cullen,\nD.A.E.

A special focus was the question of future uses for the Caucus model, seeing as it had two fully realised versions. Unofficially, a number of channels that fed into the Cork Caucus - e.g. SoundEye Festival of the Arts of the Word, the work of the Cork Artists' Collective, those projects of local and national artists and cultural practitioners who chose not to emigrate afterwards - have internalised the lessons of 2005 and proceeded with the ongoing task of galvanising the city and country's cultural ground. A confluence of these channels led to 'The Avant: Ten Days of the Progressive Arts' in 200.\n\n\n"}

It was first performed in 1998 by the theatre company Paines Plough, with which Kane was writer-in-residence for the year, at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh. The play was initially presented under the pseudonym Marie Kelvedon; Kane used a pseudonym to avoid the distraction of her reputation for graphic staged violence from her previous works. \"Crave\" was Kane's fourth play. It is dedicated by the author to Mark Ravenhill.\n\nThe play reflects a stylistic departure from Kane's previous works, using a non-linear, poetic style, and is notable for its lack of staged violence that had been a hallmark of the author's previous work; this style is continued in her next and final work, \"4.48 Psychosis.\" The dialogue is intertextual, and often it is unclear whom each line is addressed to. Much of the delivery of the text is left up to directorial interpretation. The author does not provide context, stage directions or descriptions of characters. The sex and gender of the four characters (A, B, C, and M) is only identifiable from context within the play.\n\n\"Crave\" continues the theme of pain in love that Kane had explored with previous plays, but is stylistically a departure. The play contains several dark themes, presented as issues haunting the four characters. These themes include rape, incest, pedophilia, anorexia, drug addiction, mental instability, murder, and suicide.\n\nKane incorporates numerous literary allusions in the text of the play, especially to \"The Waste Land\" by T.S. Eliot. She also makes several references to biblical scripture, especially through the character of \"A\".\n\nThe pseudonym \"Marie Kelvedon\" was based on the village of Kelvedon Hatch, where Kane grew up. Kane included the following fictitious biography in the programme notes:\nThe lyrics to Icelandic singer Björk's song \"An Echo, A Stain\", released on the album \"Vespertine\" in 2001, are based on this play.\n\n"}

Pinball is a pinball video game developed by Cinematronics and published by Maxis in 1995. It features pre-rendered 3D graphics and three tables—\"Space Cadet\", \"Skulduggery\", and \"Dragon's Keep\". On each table, there are displays on the side that show the players' score, ball number, player number, a display for various information and a table-specific image.\n\nThe \"Space Cadet\" table features the player as a member of a space fleet that completes missions to increase rank. Players can attain nine different ranks (listed from lowest to highest): Cadet, Ensign, Lieutenant, Captain, Lieutenant Commander, Commander, Commodore, Admiral, and Fleet Admiral. Players accept a mission by hitting \"mission targets\" which select which mission they will take, and by going up the \"launch ramp\". Each mission has a set number of things for players to do, such as hitting the \"attack bumpers\" (which are a set of four bumpers at the top of the table) eight times (this is the \"target practice\" mission). Some missions involve a number of steps which must be completed in sequence. Missions end either by being completed, or by being aborted due to running out of \"fuel\", as indicated by the lights in the passage that passes under the launch ramp. The \"fuel\" lights go out one by one at a time interval, and can be re-lit by having the ball go over them, or all at once by going up the launch ramp again. Upon completing a mission, some of the blue lights in a circle in the middle of the table turn on. When all of the lights in the blue circle turn on, the player's rank increases, and a light in the orange circle turns on.\n\nThe \"Skulduggery\" table features a treasure hunt where the player must find Peg Leg's loot. The player can accomplish that two ways: either by piecing together a treasure map or by activating and completing a series of mini-games on the table called modes. Modes are like missions and quests of the other two tables. They are all pirate themed mini-games, such as ship battle, tavern fight, escape Bermuda Triangle, mutiny, and sword fight.\n\nThe \"Dragon's Keep\" table features a fantasy environment where players must accomplish various quests, leading to the slaying of a dragon. The quests include Dragon Hoard (steal the hoard), Fire Lizard Attack (defeat the fire lizard), Rescue Maiden (rescue the damsel in distress), Dragon Pass (find the path to dragon's lair), Wizard's Fury, and Slay Dragon. The player can acquire awards such as spells, weapons, and armors. While weapons simply add points to the score, armors and spells temporarily turn on various gates, magnets, and chutes on the table to change the gameplay.\n\nElements from each of the three tables were elected for representation by Maxis in the illustration for the box art by Marc Ericksen, creating a montage below a hurtling Pinball.\n\n3D Pinball for Windows – Space Cadet is a version of the Space Cadet table bundled with Microsoft Windows. It was originally packaged with Microsoft Plus! 95 and later included in Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows ME, and Windows XP. This version of Pinball, developed by David Plummer at Microsoft, was a port of the game using the original art and sound, developed in C for cross-platform support because Windows NT supported RISC processors and prior versions of the game contained x86 assembly language and 16-bit logic. The Windows 98 installation CD has instructions on installing Pinball 3D on this version of Windows which are partly wrong; Microsoft later issued an updated support article. Windows XP was the last client release of Windows to include this game.\n\nThe look and feel of \"Full Tilt! Pinball\" and \"3D Pinball\" are similar, with a few exceptions: The latter contains only the \"Space Cadet\" table and only supports 640×480-pixel resolution, while the former supports three different resolutions up to 1024×768 pixels. The image on the side is a two-dimensional image as opposed to pre-rendered 3D. The words \"Maxis\" and \"Cinematronics\" have been changed from the yellow to a dark red, making them harder to see. It sports a splash screen that merely says \"3D Pinball\" and shows a small pinball graphic with faded edges. Music is not enabled by default in \"3D Pinball\". It has fewer soundtracks that are inspired by the original game.\n\nThere are only a few minor differences between the gameplay of the two versions. The completion of a mission in the Maxis version results in a replay—actually a ball save, rather than a special—being awarded. In addition, hitting a wormhole that has the same color light locks the ball, which if done repeatedly activates the multi-ball round. This is not the case in \"3D Pinball\": Completing a mission merely awards bonus points and hitting a wormhole in the above circumstances awards a replay. Also, the three yellow lights above the bumpers (both in the launch ramp and in the upper table zone) act differently: In \"3D Pinball\" these are turned off if the ball passes on them while they are on. This is not the case in the original game, where they just remain activated.\n\n\"3D Pinball for Windows – Space Cadet\" was removed from later releases of Windows due to a collision detection bug in the 64-bit version of the game that Microsoft was not able to resolve in time for the release of Windows Vista.\n\n\"Full Tilt! Pinball 2\" was released in 1996 and features three new tables: \"Mad Scientist\", \"Alien Daze\" and \"Captain Hero\".\n\nReviewing the Windows version, a reviewer for \"Next Generation\" said that while the \"Space Cadet\" table is fairly good, the other two tables suffer from cluttered graphics and weak ball physics, making them \"incredibly difficult to follow.\" He gave it two out of five stars.\n\nOverall, 3D Pinball Space Cadet gained a cult following towards fans despite the game's removal from future Windows operating systems.\n\nOn March 6, 2020, the game's sound effects were sampled in a song, \"You Better Move\" by Lil Uzi Vert, containing elements from the game. It captured positive reception from many nostalgic fans who grew up playing the game.\n\n"}

He is former Director of the Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology and co-Director of the Alzheimer Scotland Dementia Research Centre.\n\nIan Deary has contributed to numerous topics in intelligence research. For instance, he has conducted several studies into the relationship between intelligence and elementary cognitive tasks such as reaction time and inspection time, and has investigated the overlap between intelligence and educational achievement.\n\nDeary was a founder of the field of cognitive epidemiology, which studies the relationship of intelligence to health outcomes. He described and discussed cognitive epidemiology in a 2010 article for the journal Psychological Science in the Public Interest.\n\nA 2010 review in Nature Reviews Neuroscience, co-authored by Deary, described research on the neuroscience of intelligence differences.\nIn 2012, the journal Annual Review of Psychology published an overview of the field of intelligence research, authored by Deary.\n\nDeary was one of the co-founders of the Lothian Birth Cohort studies of 1921 and 1936. These studies collect data from older Scottish individuals who, aged 11, had their intelligence tested as part of the Scottish Mental Surveys of 1932 and 1947. From the year 2000 onward, Deary and colleagues contacted surviving members of these surveys living in the Edinburgh and Lothians areas and invited them to retake the same intelligence test, along with further batteries of cognitive tests. Members of the cohorts born in 1921 were followed up at age of 79, and those born in 1936 at age 70. Interview and biomedical data were also collected from the cohort members to allow wide-ranging investigation of the causes and consequences of differences in cognition across the lifespan.\n\nUsing data from the Lothian Birth Cohort studies, Deary and colleagues have investigated the effects of ageing on cognition. For instance, studies have shown that intelligence between age 11 and age 79 is highly stable (correlation of around r = .66), and that childhood and old age intelligence have a genetic correlation of .62. A number of papers from the Lothian Birth Cohort studies, co-authored by Deary, have reported that higher childhood intelligence scores negatively predict earlier mortality; that is, more intelligent people live longer.\n\nData from the Lothian Birth Cohort studies continue to be used for studies of the relationship of intelligence to a wide variety of health, educational and socioeconomic outcomes. In addition, genetic and brain imaging data from members of the Cohorts allow investigation of the biological causes of differences in intelligence and cognitive ageing.\n\nIan Deary is a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the British Academy, the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, and the Association for Psychological Science. He is a past president of the International Society for the Study of Individual Differences, and has held a Royal Society-Wolfson Research Merit Award (2003–2007) for research into cognitive ageing. In 2003 he received the first of the Chancellor's Awards at the University of Edinburgh, and in 2010 was named as a Distinguished European Personality Psychologist by the European Association of Personality Psychology.

Even though by the mid 1970s his career had slowed down, he is still considered arguably Sweden's most popular singer of all time and was long a very popular figure in media.\n\nHis breakthrough was in 1949 with his first record, \"Tangokavaljeren\", which reached #2 in Sweden. After that he became one of the leading faces in popular music, scoring 12 #2 hit singles in the 1950s. He also did some movies in the late 1950s.\n\nIn the 1960s, he became the first singer to have a #2 single on the new Swedish chart \"Svensktoppen\" (the most important Swedish chart) with the 1962 single \"Midnattstango\". It stayed a total of 18 weeks in the charts. Between the years 1962-1972 he had 35 songs on the chart.\n\nLönndahl was born in Stockholm to a Swedish mother and an English father. His father left the family early and Lönndahl rarely saw him. Lönndahl remembers his father as a man who rarely worked and lived off his wife before absconding. After Lönndahl found fame, his father tried reconnecting with his son, asking him for money. Lönndahl however, never connected with his father again as be believed too much time had passed and that his father's appearance came much too late. During the end of 1970, Lönndahl's seven-year-old daughter Malin and her mother died in a car accident in Los Angeles, California. After the incident, Lönndahl for a period of time went into a self-imposed exile to the United States, eluding the Swedish press. He subsequently returned to Sweden but refused to record new material, claiming it was too \"onerous to be Sweden's greatest singer\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. People who have stayed in the castle include Eleanor of Aquitaine and Mary, Queen of Scots, who was a prisoner there.\n\nTutbury Castle became the headquarters of Henry de Ferrers and was the centre of the wapentake of Appletree, which included Duffield Frith. With his wife Bertha, he endowed Tutbury Priory with two manors in about 1080. It would seem that Tutbury at that time was a dependency of the Norman abbey of St Pierre‑sur‑Dives.\n\nThe castle was \"nearly destroyed\" by Prince Edward in 1264 after the rebellion of Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby. In 1269, after a further rebellion the lands were given to Edmund Crouchback and have remained part of the Duchy of Lancaster.\n\nBy the 1300s the castle was largely repaired, though as a residential castle rather than a military strong-point.\n\nSome time before 1370 the castle was even more substantially rebuilt again by John of Gaunt. From 1372 until her death in 1394, the castle was the permanent residence of Constance, the wife of John of Gaunt. Her court lavishly patronised music and the arts, and was said to have \"somewhat similar to a modern Windsor\" in its ambition.\n\nIn June 1568, Mary, Queen of Scots was at Carlisle Castle after fleeing from Scotland after her defeat at the battle of Langside, and the English Privy Council decided to lodge her either at Nottingham Castle, Fotheringhay Castle or Tutbury, so that she was further from the Scottish border or Yorkshire. In January 1569 the Scottish Queen was taken from Bolton Castle, going first to Ripon and staying a night nearby, then to Wetherby staying a night with John Vavasour at Hazlewood Castle, then on to Pontefract, Rotherham, Chesterfield, and Wingfield Manor. George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury was given detailed instructions for keeping Mary, which permitted him to lodge her at Sheffield from time to time (which he preferred), and briefed him on what he should say to her regarding her political predicament.\n\nTapestries, furniture, and bedding were sent from the Royal Wardrobe at the Tower of London to furnish Tutbury, but because of delays caused by poor weather Bess of Hardwick was asked to send her things from Sheffield. This left the Earl's houses at Sheffield unfurnished, so Mary had to go to Tutbury. She arrived on 4 February 1569. She noted the castle was like a hunting lodge, with its enclosure on a slight hill reminiscent of the Bois de Vincennes, and complained of the damp, the wet plaster, and draughty ill-fitting old carpentry. The British Library has a sketch plan of her accommodation at Tutbury.\n\nIn March the Earl of Shrewsbury described how Mary sat with Bess, Countess of Shrewsbury in the countess' chamber at Tutbury with Lady Livingston and Mary Seton working at embroidery. She moved to Wingfield Manor in April. Mary was returned to Tutbury in September with increased guard and a reduced household. In November 1569, following the Catholic Rising of the North, Mary was rushed south to Coventry where she stayed in an inn. Elizabeth sent orders for her return to Tutbury on Christmas Eve. The \"pauvre prisonniere\" (poor prisoner), as she described herself, was back at Tutbury on 2 January 1570. Mary was sent to Chatsworth in May 1570.\n\nIn January 1585 she once again returned to Tutbury via Wingfield Manor, and on the way stayed a night in Derby in the house of a widowed Mrs Beaumont. Her keepers Ralph Sadler and John Somer were made busy providing satisfactory hangings for Mary's bedchamber. Hangings brought from Lord Paget's nearby houses at Burton and Beaudesert were unsatisfactory. The queen's bedchamber was located at the top of a lodging (immediately under its roof), which was built against the castle wall. This room was of timber construction, and had no windows looking out through the castle wall, its two windows looked into the castle court. To increase the warmth of her bedchamber Mary improvised a tent of tapestry over her bed.\n\nMary also had a billiard table at Tutbury. Ralph Sadler sometimes took Mary hunting with his hawks on the river Dove, no farther than three miles from the castle, with a guard of 40 or 50 men on horseback. Queen Elizabeth disapproved of this freedom and forbade it. On 19 April 1585 Mary was placed in the care of Sir Amyas Paulet, who took down Mary's cloth of estate from the chamber where he ate, and stopped Mary's servants using the wall walk near the gate. Paulet also curtailed her charitable activities in the town, and disarmed her Scottish servants, many of whom had pistols.\n\nIn July she was allowed to hunt her greyhound after deer at Stockley Park near Anslow. By August Mary was anxious to move temporarily to another house so her lodgings could be swept and cleaned. Mary pointed out that the Earl of Shrewsbury followed this routine. However, Lord Paget's nearby houses and the house of Henry Cavendish (son of William Cavendish) at Doveridge were not suitable to house all her train of servants. Paulet considered modifying her lodging or letting the queen use another part of the part of the castle which he occupied. Security was difficult for this other lodging, where Mary had stayed in 1569. It had two chambers twenty-four feet above ground level, with windows looking over the dykes towards Tutbury town. The windows and a \"house of office\", a latrine, could have been used for escape. On Christmas Eve 1585, she finally moved to Chartley Castle.\n\nBy the late sixteenth century the fabric of the castle began to decay, although James I stayed there a number of times between 1619 and 1624. During the English Civil War the castle was held by Royalist forces and re-fortified for the Crown. In 1643 Parliamentary forces attempted unsuccessfully to dislodge the garrison, and in April 1646 the garrison surrendered after a three week siege. Following the siege, a treaty of surrender was agreed upon, and the conditions were drawn up by Sir Andrew Kniveton, the Governor of Tutbury Castle – with the agreement being signed on 20 April 1646. However in the following on 19 July 1647, it was determined \"that the castle was untenable\", following the siege and damages caused to the castle. Finally in control of the castle, Parliament ordered the fortification to be destroyed; demolition work being carried out from 1647 to 1648. A folly was built on top of the motte in 1780. \n\n\n"}

He was a founding member of the \"Channel 4 News\" Team in 1982 and remained there until joining the BBC in 1990. He started work on the BBC's \"Newsnight\" programme in 1992, serving as political editor from 2007 until his departure from the BBC in 2011. Crick then returned to \"Channel 4 News\" as political correspondent. In 2014 he was chosen as Specialist Journalist of the Year at the Royal Television Society television journalism awards.\n\nCrick was born in Northampton, the eldest child of teachers John Crick and Patricia Wright, and brother to triplets Catherine, Anne and Beatrice. He was educated at the Manchester Grammar School (then a direct grant grammar school) and in 1975 was a member of the winning school team in the English Speaking Union Public Speaking Competition. Crick joined the Labour Party at the age of 15, and while revising for his A-levels, he worked as election agent for the party's candidate Gerard Collier (now Lord Monkswell).\n\nCrick then studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at New College, Oxford and graduated with a first class honours Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. At Oxford, he was editor of the student newspaper, \"Cherwell\"; founded both the Oxford Handbook and the Oxbridge Careers Handbook; chaired the Democratic Labour Club; and was president of the Oxford Union in Michaelmas Term 1979, succeeding Theresa May's future husband Philip.\n\nAfter university, the Labour Party gave Crick the opportunity to contest the safe-seat of Bootle but he turned down the offer. Crick started work at ITN as a trainee journalist in 1980. He was a founding member of the \"Channel 4 News\" team when the programme was launched in November 1982. During his period as their Washington correspondent (1988–1990) Crick won an award from the Royal Television Society for his coverage of the 1988 Presidential election between George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis.\n\nHis first book, a study of the Militant tendency, ran to two editions, published by Faber in 1984 and 1986. \"Scargill and the Miners\" was published by Penguin in 1985.\n\nCrick joined the BBC in 1990, first on \"Panorama\", becoming a regular reporter on BBC 2's \"Newsnight\" in 1992. \"Jeffrey Archer: Stranger Than Fiction\", his unauthorised biography of the novelist and former politician, appeared in its first edition during 1995.\n\nCrick has investigated other politicians too, and has written unofficial biographies of several public figures. When Mark Mardell interviewed Archer for \"Newsnight\" in 1999 during his campaign to be elected mayor of London, Archer levelled, on camera, the following apparent threat at Crick: \"You wait till I'm Mayor. You'll find out how tough I am.\" In 2002, Crick won an RTS Award for his \"Panorama\" programme \"Jeffrey Archer: A Life of Lies\" broadcast after Archer's conviction for perjury the previous July.\n\nAfter the Archer documentary, Crick began work on his biography of Sir Alex Ferguson which was published in 2002. Reporting \"utterly misplaced\" speculation that Crick would not be objective because of his lifelong support of Manchester United, Leo McKinstry wrote for the \"Daily Telegraph\" that Ferguson \"has found a worthy, if hardly compliant, biographer\".\n\nIn 2003, under heavy pressure during the Hutton Inquiry, the BBC refused to show Crick's report for \"Newsnight\" into 'Betsygate'. These claims involved the alleged misuse of public funds by the private office of former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith and supposed payments to his wife Betsy for work she did not do. Crick had begun to investigate these claims in the Spring after a tip-off from a Conservative insider with knowledge of Duncan Smith's office. Crick referred the case to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Sir Philip Mawer and the Duncan Smiths were largely cleared of any impropriety. Crick himself later said that he had been wrong to enter the \"political arena\" by referring the case to Mawer.\n\nA biography, \"In Search of Michael Howard\", was published just before the 2005 general election. Simon Heffer in \"The Spectator\" wrote that \"it is thorough and well-researched, in some respects exceptionally so\". In that year's election, it was observed that the five most terrifying words in the political lexicon were \"Michael Crick is in reception\".\n\nCrick was appointed \"Newsnight\"s political editor in March 2007 in succession to Martha Kearney. \"We're very lucky in the freedoms that we have on Newsnight to express ourselves as individuals. We are allowed to do our own thing\", he said of the programme at the time. He broke the story in June 2008 concerning Caroline Spelman's misuse of her parliamentary staffing allowance which she was found to have used to pay her nanny.\n\nIn July 2011, it was announced that Crick was returning to Channel 4 News as political correspondent, replacing Cathy Newman under political editor Gary Gibbon. He made his last appearance on \"Newsnight\" on 29 July 2011. He was replaced by Allegra Stratton. The following September, he said in an interview for \"The Independent\": \"I was 19 years on Newsnight and 18 of them were extremely happy and then towards the end, about a year ago, they made it clear to me that they wanted me to stop being the political editor and do another job, which was ill-defined.\" The journalist Nick Cohen, in appraising \"Newsnight\" and BBC practices shortly after the departure of Crick and other journalists, wrote that \"Crick adheres instead to the honourable belief that the job of the reporter is to create as much trouble as possible. He lives by his creed by bringing in scoop after scoop.\"\n\nCrick's revelation that the September 2012 'Plebgate' scandal was based on entirely fictitious evidence was the subject of a \"Dispatches\" programme in December 2012. The false accusations made against (then) Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell resulted in Mitchell resigning, and Crick found evidence of collusion by the Metropolitan Police.\n\nIn Summer 2013, he reported that a file on the Conservative politician Michael Mates had been sent to the Crown Prosecution Service concerning alleged offences committed during his candidacy in the Police and Crime Commissioner elections in 2012 for the post in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.\n\nIn 2018, Crick’s investigations on behalf of Channel 4 into violations of electoral law in the South Thanet constituency during the 2017 General Election resulted in the conviction of the Conservative Party regional organiser in 2019 of serious breaches of illegal spending. One consequence of his investigations has been a tightening of electoral law to prevent local candidates from using profiles of national figures in their literature. The costs of national figures supporting local candidates must be declared within local party expenditure accounts; these will be very closely scrutinised during the 2019 general election.\n\nIn April 2019, Crick announced he had retired from Channel 4 and ITN citing that he was \"looking forward to an exciting new life writing books again, and all sorts of other activity in journalism and other fields.\" He has since joined Mail Plus.\n\nCrick lives in Wandsworth, south London, with his partner Lucy Hetherington, an executive TV producer who has managed documentaries and current affairs programmes. She is the daughter of former \"Guardian\" editor Alastair Hetherington. They have a daughter, born in 2006.\n\nHe also has an older daughter, born in 1987, from his former marriage to Margaret Crick, who was his wife from 1985 to 2008. Margaret was a former TV presenter who published a biography of Jeffrey Archer's wife Mary in 2005.\n\nA keen supporter of Manchester United, he has written several books on the team as well as his political works. In 1998–99 he was the organiser of the Shareholders United Against Murdoch campaign which successfully opposed the proposed takeover of United by BSkyB. He later served as Vice-Chairman of Shareholders United. \"The BBC weren't very pleased\" at his involvement, he said in 2007.\n\nSince 2012 Crick has been a lay member of the board of governors of the University of Manchester, and he also sits on the board of Manchester University Press.\n\n\n"}

Thomas Allbutt, Vicar of Dewsbury and his wife Marianne, daughter of Robert Wooler, of Dewsbury (1801–1843). He was educated at St Peter's School, York and Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1859, with a First Class degree in natural sciences in 1860. After studying medicine at St George's Hospital, Hyde Park Corner, London, and taking the Cambridge MB degree in 1861, he went to Paris and attended the clinics of Armand Trousseau, Duchenne de Boulogne (G. B. A. Duchenne) author of \"Mécanisme de la physionomie humaine\", Pierre-Antoine-Ernest Bazin and Hardy. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1880, while still practising at Leeds General Infirmary (1861 to 1889).\n\nAfter serving as one of the Commissioners for Lunacy in England and Wales from 1889, Allbutt became Regius Professor of Physic (medicine) at the University of Cambridge in 1892, and was knighted (K. C. B.) in 1907. He died in Cambridge, England in 1925.\n\nAllbutt was married to Susan, daughter of Thomas England, merchant, of Headingley, Leeds, on 15 September 1869. They had no children.\n\nFrom 1861 to 1889 Allbutt was a successful consulting physician in Leeds, when he commissioned Edward Schroeder Prior to design Carr Manor for his residence.\n\nAllbutt was Physician at the General Infirmary at Leeds where he introduced the ophthalmoscope, weighing machine and microscope to the wards. During 1865 and 1866 he treated victims of an outbreak of typhus fever by open-air methods. He later advocated open-air methods for consumption (tuberculosis). Allbutt was a member of the Council of the Leeds School of Medicine (now part of the University of Leeds) from 1864 to 1884 and its President twice.\n\nAllbutt's residence whilst in Leeds was Virginia Cottage, Virginia Road. This is now part of Lyddon Hall, one of the university's halls of residence, where there is a blue plaque commemorating him.\n\nIn 1870 Allbutt published \"Medical Thermometry\", an article outlining the history of thermometry and describing his invention: a clinical thermometer approximately 6 inches in length that a physician could have habitually in a pocket. His version of the thermometer, devised in 1867, was quickly adopted elsewhere, instead of the model previously in use, which was one foot long and which patients were required to hold for about twenty minutes.\n\nAllbutt conducted some of his work at the nearby West Riding Asylum, Wadsley. In his monograph \"On the Use of the Ophthalmoscope in Diseases of the Nervous System and of the Kidneys\" (1871),\n\nHis other work included initiating and encouraging the practice of consultation between medical witnesses before the hearing of legal cases. In 1884 he gave the Goulstonian Lectures 'Chapters on visceral neuroses' at the Royal College of Physicians. In 1885 he introduced the surgical treatment of tuberculous glands in the neck. In an address at Glasgow in 1888 he urged the study of comparative medicine, proposing that information gained by observing the physiology and diseases of animals could often be applied to human medicine. Allbutt also made important studies of tetanus and hydrophobia.\n\nThe novelist George Eliot described Allbutt as a 'good, clever and graceful man, enough to enable one to be cheerful under the horrible smoke of ugly Leeds'. He is regarded generally as the model for George Eliot's Dr Lydgate in Middlemarch. Allbutt has been commemorated with a Leeds Civic Trust blue plaque. It was unveiled on his former home, now Lyddon Hall, on the Leeds University campus.\n\nFrom 1889 to 1892 he was a Commissioner for Lunacy in England and Wales, and he moved from Leeds to London. In 1892 he moved to Cambridge on becoming Regius Professor of Physic in the University of Cambridge, where he edited his \"System of Medicine\", a work which a biographer has described as 'his greatest service to contemporary medicine'. It was published in eight volumes, 1896 to 1899, with a second edition in eleven volumes, 1905 to 1911. For many years this was regarded as the 'doctor's bible'.\n\nAllbutt was president of the British Medical Association in 1920 and in the same year was admitted a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1922.\n\nAllbutt continued as regius professor of physic at Cambridge until his death in 1925 when Sir Humphry Rolleston, Physician-in-Ordinary to King George V was elected as his successor.\n\nIn the article \"\" which he contributed to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" Eleventh Edition (1911), Volume 18 (pages 41 to 64), the first column began by stating that the science of medicine as then understood was concerned with the treatment of disease, and included pathology, therapeutics and pharmacology which were the subject of separate articles. The bulk of the article was the history of medicine, the first half up to 18th century, the remainder (from page 51) on the development of modern medicine including sections for \"English Medicine from 1800 to 1840\", \"German Medicine from 1800 to 1840\" and \"Modern Progress\". Allbutt wrote the nine page section on \"Modern Progress\". The article, and an obituary, have been transcribed for Wikisource.\n\nAllbutt's article had revised the version in the 10th edition (1902) contributed by Joseph Frank Payne, and Allbutt's was in turn revised and updated in two parts for the 14th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica (volume 15), one part \"Medicine, General\", by Rolleston, the other part \"Medicine, History of\", by Charles Singer, Lecturer in the History of Medicine, University of London.\n\nAllbutt supported Sir William Osler in the founding of The History of Medicine Society at The Royal Society of Medicine, London in 1912.\n\n\n"}

On the death of Moritz Hauptmann on 3 January 1868, he was elected cantor of Thomasschule zu Leipzig, conducting the Thomanerchor, an office he retained until his death.\n\nHe is best known by three theoretical works: \"Lehrbuch der Harmonie\", \"Lehre vom Contra punct\" and \"Lehre von der Fuge\", valuable textbooks known to English students through the translation by Franklin Taylor.\n\n\"Ernst Friedrich [Eduard] Richter [(1808-1879)]...His compositions include psalms for chorus and orchestra, motets, two masses, a Stabat Mater (voices only), part songs, string quartets and sonatas, and also pieces for organ and for piano. But it is his treatise on the theory of music that will keep Professor Richter's name from oblivion. As already mentioned, two English editions have appeared: one in London (printed without Richter's leave, by the way) by Mr. Franklin Taylor, which must by no means be accepted as a translation, but merely as a very moderate adaptation; the other, unfortunately little known in this country, printed with Richter's consent by John P. Morgan, in New York. The latter translation is most carefully done, and forms a strong contrast to the English edition. On last Good Friday, the 150th anniversary of the first production of Bach's Matthew Passion, the dear old cantor and beloved professor [Richter] was laid to his last rest, accompanied to his grave by the solemn sound of the beautiful choral, Jesu, meine Zuversicht. More hearty regret has rarely filled the hearts of those standing round a musician's grave. Once more the voices of his choir arose in Bach's beautiful melody to Wenn ich eimmal soil scheiden, and then with a last look at his coffin the crowd dispersed. But though gone to his last rest, the memory of many of us will long cherish, as one of the truest artists, most thorough musicians and excellent teachers, that we have ever met, the name of Ernst Friedrich Richter.\"\n\nRichter's method of instruction—and the academy approach to harmonic education overall—was criticized by Arnold Schoenberg in his 1911 text, \"Harmonielehre\", or \"Theory of Harmony\". Schoenberg denounced the respective isolation of harmonic theory, counterpoint, and form in compositional education as productive only of an \"artless and primitive\" approach to composition.\n"}

In the same poll, when ABC said \"Terri suffered brain damage and has been on life support for 15 years. Doctors say she has no consciousness and her condition is irreversible\", 63% said that they support the removal of Schiavo's feeding tube. Sixty-seven percent agreed with the statement that \"elected officials trying to keep Schiavo alive are doing so more for political advantage than out of concern for her or for the principles involved\".\n\nA poll by CBS News reported on March 23 showed that 82% of respondents believed Congress and the President should stay out of the matter, while 74% thought it was \"all about politics\". Only 13% thought Congress acted out of concern for Schiavo. Furthermore, the approval ratings of Congress sank to 34%, its lowest since 1997.\n\nTwo CNN/USA Today/Gallup polls on the case also showed public support for removing Schiavo's feeding tube, but by smaller margins. In response to the question, \"Based on what you have heard or read about the case, do you think that the feeding tube should or should not have been removed?\", 56% of respondents agreed and 31% disagreed when polled between March 18–20. When respondents were asked the same question on an April 1–2 poll, conducted after Schiavo's death, 53% agreed with the feeding tube's removal while 41% disagreed. Gallup concluded that \"These poll results, obtained after Schiavo's death on March 31, reflect an increase in opposition to the removal of the tube compared to mid-March data.\" The poll also showed continued strong disapproval for Congress's involvement in the case.\n\nU.S. President George W. Bush, Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, many Republicans, several Democrats in the Florida Legislature and U.S. Congress, and Vatican officials sided with Schiavo's parents. Other groups and individuals, including the American Civil Liberties Union as well as many Democratic and several Republican legislators, expressed support for the position of Michael Schiavo. One individual activist even filed a \"pro se\" appeal with the Florida State Supreme Court.\n\nVarious Christian organizations, mostly affiliated with the Christian right, demanded that Schiavo's feeding tube be reinserted. Consumer activist Ralph Nader and the Reverend Jesse Jackson, a Democrat and civil rights activist, also called for Schiavo's feeding tube to be reinserted. On March 29, 2005, Jackson prayed with the Schindler family outside of Schiavo's Florida hospice. Some groups, such as Not Dead Yet, also protested the removal of the feeding tube because they felt it violated the rights of the disabled.\n\nForty-seven protesters, including many children, were arrested outside the hospice where Schiavo was located. Most of these were non-violent, staged arrests for trespassing, made when protestors crossed a police line in a symbolic attempt to bring water to Schiavo. The last arrest occurred after Jackson's press conference on March 29, 2005, when a family therapist from Scranton, Pennsylvania, named Dow Pursley slipped past the police cordon and headed for the hospice's main entrance, carrying two bottles of water for Schiavo. Police officers stunned Pursley with a Taser and apprehended him. Pursley was charged with attempted burglary and resisting arrest without violence.\n\nRichard Alan Meywes of North Carolina was accused of offering $250,000 over the Internet for the murder of Michael Schiavo and $50,000 for the murder of Judge George Greer. Because of the nature of his crimes, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was involved in the case, and Meywes was charged under Federal law. Meywes's lawyer claimed he was \"not serious\" about his offers.\n\nIn another case, Michael Mitchell, of Rockford, Illinois, attempted to rob a Florida gun store as part of an attempt to rescue Terri Schiavo. He selected Randall's Firearms, which was located near Schiavo's hospice in Seminole, Florida. Mitchell first entered the store and spoke with owner Randy McKenzie, and then departed. He returned twenty minutes later, drew a folding knife on McKenzie, and smashed a glass display case in an attempt to seize an aluminum gun case which contained a .454 Casull revolver and ammunition. McKenzie drew his own revolver in response, and Mitchell fled to his van and drove off, only to be quickly apprehended. \"I honor his strength of conviction,\" Russell Mitchell said of his son, \"but two wrongs don't make a right. They were wrong for starving [Schiavo], but he was wrong for committing another immoral act trying to get her loose.\" Mitchell was charged with attempted armed robbery, aggravated assault and criminal mischief.\n\nMichael Schiavo's live-in girlfriend Jodi Centonze received hate mail letters. Additionally, the wife of one of Michael Schiavo's brothers was targeted; a white car drove by her home three times over the course of several hours, and on the last pass the driver shouted to her, \"If Terri dies, I'm coming back to shoot you and your family.\" Another one of Michael Schiavo's brothers said he received death threats every time the case was in the news.\n\nOn the day Schiavo died, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay criticized the legal system and said, \"The time will come for the men responsible [the judges] for this to answer for their behavior.\" He also threatened to impeach the judges who refused to intervene on Schiavo's behalf. \"We will look at an unaccountable, arrogant, out-of-control judiciary that thumbed their nose at Congress and the president,\" DeLay said. On April 14, 2005, DeLay held a news conference and issued an apology for the tone of his comments. He stated, \"I said something in an inartful way, and I shouldn't have said it that way, and I apologize for saying it that way.\"\n\nJudge Greer and his family were placed under protection by the U.S. Marshals due to death threats for having ruled against restoring Schiavo's feeding tube. Additionally, he was asked to leave his Southern Baptist congregation, Calvary Baptist Church, in Clearwater.\n\nDuring the final stages of the court battle in March 2005, around 30 individuals made a variety of complaints to the DCF, alleging various abuses. These included Terri Schiavo being in pain from recent dental work, although she had not had any dental work for years prior to that, and sensory deprivation. DCF investigators found the claims to be groundless, stating that there were \"no indicators\" of abuse in any of the cases and concluding that \"the preponderance of the evidence shows that Michael Schiavo followed doctors' orders regarding Ms. Schiavo's diagnosis of being in a persistent vegetative state and that he provided her with appropriate care.\"\n\nThe Schindler family and their supporters hold that this is a landmark case where a guardian's judgment was disputed, but ended with a court order to remove nutrition and hydration.\n\nPeople on the other side of this issue, including the ACLU hold this was a private matter and the actions of the Schindlers interfered with the guardianship authority of her husband Michael Schiavo and the privacy rights of Terri Schiavo.\n\nAdvocates indicate that the rate of living will creation has increased since Terri Schiavo died. An alternate mechanism is for a person to name a close relative or one whom they trust to speak for them, granting him or her power of attorney for medical issues.\n\nPaul Schenck's organization, NPLAC, has commissioned a sculpture to Terri Schiavo entitled \"Compassion\".\n\nThe case prompted bishop William Skylstad, president of the USCCB, to ask the Vatican Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith some questions as to the moral theology in such cases. The reply of August 1, 2007, released by the Holy See on September 14, 2007, was, to the questions posed:\n\nSchiavo's case has focused attention on end-of-life medical ethics.\n\nThe Schindler family started the Terri Schindler Schiavo Foundation in 2001 to oppose the removal of Schiavo's feeding tube. After her death, the foundation reorganized to address similar situations. In 2010 the foundation was renamed the Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network. Collin Raye became the network's national spokesperson in September 2011.\n"}

{"id": "2127530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127530", "title": "Business Plot", "text": "Business Plot\n\nThe Business Plot was a political conspiracy in 1933 in the United States. Retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler asserted that wealthy businessmen were plotting to create a fascist veterans' organization with Butler as its leader and use it in a coup d'état to overthrow President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1934, Butler testified before the United States House of Representatives Special Committee on Un-American Activities (the \"McCormack–Dickstein Committee\") on these revelations. No one was prosecuted.\n\nAt the time of the incidents, most major news media dismissed the plot, with a \"New York Times\" editorial characterizing it as a \"gigantic hoax\". While some historians have not accepted the notion of a plot, they agree that Butler described one.\nJournalist George Seldes described the plot in detail in his book 1000 American.\n\nOn July 17, 1932, thousands of World War I veterans converged on Washington, D.C., set up tent camps, and demanded immediate payment of bonuses due to them according to the World War Adjusted Compensation Act of 1924 (the original act made the bonuses initially due no earlier than 1925 and no later than 1945). Walter W. Waters, a former Army sergeant, led this \"Bonus Army\". The Bonus Army was encouraged by an appearance from retired Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler; as a popular military figure of the time. A few days after Butler's arrival, President Herbert Hoover ordered the marchers removed and U.S. Army cavalry troops under the command of Gen. Douglas MacArthur destroyed their camps.\n\nButler, although a self-described Republican, responded by supporting Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 US presidential election. By 1933 Butler started denouncing capitalism and bankers, going on to explain that for 33 years he had been a \"high-class muscle man\" for Wall Street, the bankers and big business, labeling himself as a \"racketeer for Capitalism.\"\n\nRoosevelt's election was upsetting for many conservative businessmen of the time, as his \"campaign promise that the government would provide jobs for all the unemployed had the perverse effect of creating a new wave of unemployment by businessmen frightened by fears of socialism and reckless government spending.\" Some writers have said concerns over the gold standard were also involved; Jules Archer, in \"The Plot to Seize the White House\", wrote that with the end of the gold standard, \"conservative financiers were horrified. They viewed a currency not solidly backed by gold as inflationary, undermining both private and business fortunes and leading to national bankruptcy. Roosevelt was damned as a socialist or Communist out to destroy private enterprise by sapping the gold backing of wealth in order to subsidize the poor.\"\n\nThe Committee began examining evidence on November 20, 1934. On November 24 the committee released a statement detailing the testimony it had heard about the plot and its preliminary findings. On February 15, 1935, the committee submitted its final report to the House of Representatives.\n\nDuring the McCormack–Dickstein Committee hearings Butler testified that Gerald C. MacGuire attempted to recruit him to lead a coup, promising him an army of 500,000 men for a march on Washington, DC, and financial backing. Butler testified that the pretext for the coup would be that the president's health was failing. Despite Butler's support for Roosevelt in the election and his reputation as a strong critic of capitalism, Butler said the plotters felt his good reputation and popularity were vital in attracting support amongst the general public and saw him as easier to manipulate than others. Given a successful coup, Butler said that the plan was for him to have held near-absolute power in the newly created position of \"Secretary of General Affairs\", while Roosevelt would have assumed a figurehead role. \n\nThose implicated in the plot by Butler all denied any involvement. MacGuire was the only figure identified by Butler who testified before the committee. Others Butler accused were not called to appear to testify because the \"committee has had no evidence before it that would in the slightest degree warrant calling before it such men ... The committee will not take cognizance of names brought into testimony which constitute mere hearsay.\"\n\nOn the final day of the committee, January 29, 1935, John L. Spivak published the first of two articles in the communist magazine \"New Masses\", revealing portions of the Congressional committee testimony that had been redacted as hearsay. Spivak argued that the plot was part of a plan by J.P. Morgan and other financiers who were coordinating with fascist groups to overthrow President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nHans Schmidt concludes that while Spivak made a cogent argument for taking the suppressed testimony seriously, he embellished his article with his \"overblown\" claims regarding Jewish financiers, which Schmidt dismisses as guilt by association not supported by the evidence of the Butler-MacGuire conversations themselves.\n\nOn March 25, 1935, MacGuire died in a hospital in New Haven, Connecticut, at the age of 37. His attending doctor at the hospital attributed the death to pneumonia and its complications, but also said that the accusations against MacGuire had led to his weakened condition and collapse which in turn led to the pneumonia.\n\nOn July 1, 1933, Butler met with MacGuire and Doyle for the first time. Gerald C. MacGuire was a $100-a-week bond salesman for Grayson Murphy & Company and a member of the Connecticut American Legion. Bill Doyle was commander of the Massachusetts American Legion. Butler stated that he was asked to run for National Commander of the American Legion.\n\nOn July 3 or 4, Butler held a second meeting with MacGuire and Doyle. He stated that they offered to get hundreds of supporters at the American Legion convention to ask for a speech. MacGuire left a typewritten speech with Butler that they proposed he read at the convention. \"It urged the American Legion convention to adopt a resolution calling for the United States to return to the gold standard, so that when veterans were paid the bonus promised to them, the money they received would not be worthless paper.\" The inclusion of this demand further increased Butler's suspicion.\n\nAround August 1, MacGuire visited Butler alone. Butler stated that MacGuire told him Grayson Murphy underwrote the formation of the American Legion in New York and Butler told MacGuire that the American Legion was \"nothing but a strikebreaking outfit.\" Butler never saw Doyle again.\n\nOn September 24, MacGuire visited Butler's hotel room in Newark. In late September Butler met with Robert Sterling Clark. Clark was an art collector and an heir to the Singer Corporation fortune. MacGuire had known Robert S. Clark when he was a second lieutenant in China during the Boxer Rebellion. Clark had been nicknamed \"the millionaire lieutenant\".\n\nDuring the first half of 1934, MacGuire traveled to Europe and mailed postcards to Butler. On March 6, MacGuire wrote Clark and Clark's attorney a letter describing the Croix-de-Feu.\n\nOn August 22, Butler met MacGuire at a hotel, the last time Butler met him. According to Butler's account, it was on this occasion that MacGuire asked Butler to run a new veterans' organization and lead a coup attempt against the President.\n\nOn September 13, Paul Comly French, a reporter who had once been Butler's personal secretary, met MacGuire in his office. In late September, Butler told Van Zandt that co-conspirators would be meeting him at an upcoming Veterans of Foreign Wars convention.\n\nOn November 20 the Committee began examining evidence. Journalist Paul Comly French broke the story in the \"Philadelphia Record\" and \"New York Post\" on November 21. On November 22, \"The New York Times\" wrote its first article on the story and described it as a \"gigantic hoax\".\n\nThe Congressional committee preliminary report said:\n\nThis committee has had no evidence before it that would in the slightest degree warrant calling before it such men as John W. Davis, Gen. Hugh Johnson, General Harbord, Thomas W. Lamont, Admiral Sims, or Hanford MacNider.\n<br>The committee will not take cognizance of names brought into the testimony which constitute mere hearsay.\n<br>This committee is not concerned with premature newspaper accounts especially when given and published prior to the taking of the testimony.\n<br>As the result of information which has been in possession of this committee for some time, it was decided to hear the story of Maj. Gen. Smedley D. Butler and such others as might have knowledge germane to the issue. ...\n\nThe Congressional committee final report said:\n\nIn the last few weeks of the committee's official life it received evidence showing that certain persons had made an attempt to establish a fascist organization in this country. No evidence was presented and this committee had none to show a connection between this effort and any fascist activity of any European country. There is no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution when and if the financial backers deemed it expedient.\n<br>This committee received evidence from Maj. Gen Smedley D. Butler (retired), twice decorated by the Congress of the United States. He testified before the committee as to conversations with one Gerald C. MacGuire in which the latter is alleged to have suggested the formation of a fascist army under the leadership of General Butler.\n<br>MacGuire denied these allegations under oath, but your committee was able to verify all the pertinent statements made by General Butler, with the exception of the direct statement suggesting the creation of the organization. This, however, was corroborated in the correspondence of MacGuire with his principal, Robert Sterling Clark, of New York City, while MacGuire was abroad studying the various forms of veterans organizations of Fascist character.\n\nA \"The New York Times\" editorial dismissed Butler's story as \"a gigantic hoax\" and a \"bald and unconvincing narrative.\" Thomas W. Lamont of J.P. Morgan called it \"perfect moonshine\". Gen. Douglas MacArthur, alleged to be the back-up leader of the putsch if Butler declined, referred to it as \"the best laugh story of the year.\" \"Time\" magazine and other publications also scoffed at the allegations.\n\nWhen the committee released its report, editorials remained skeptical. \"Time\" wrote: \"Also last week the House Committee on Un-American Activities purported to report that a two-month investigation had convinced it that General Butler's story of a Fascist march on Washington was alarmingly true.\" \"The New York Times\" reported that the committee \"alleged that definite proof had been found that the much publicized Fascist march on Washington, which was to have been led by Maj. Gen. Smedley D. Butler, retired, according to testimony at a hearing, was actually contemplated.\"\nSeparately, Veterans of Foreign Wars commander James E. Van Zandt stated to the press, \"Less than two months\" after Gen. Butler warned him, \"he had been approached by 'agents of Wall Street' to lead a Fascist dictatorship in the United States under the guise of a 'Veterans Organization'.\"\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. said in 1958, \"Most people agreed with Mayor La Guardia of New York in dismissing it as a 'cocktail putsch'\" (argumentum ab auctoritate via a very likely fabricated argumentum ad populum). In Schlesinger's summation of the affair in 1958, \"No doubt, MacGuire did have some wild scheme in mind, though the gap between contemplation and execution was considerable, and it can hardly be supposed that the Republic was in much danger.\"\n\nRobert F. Burk wrote, \"At their core, the accusations probably consisted of a mixture of actual attempts at influence peddling by a small core of financiers with ties to veterans organizations and the self-serving accusations of Butler against the enemies of his pacifist and populist causes.\"\n\nHans Schmidt wrote, \"Even if Butler was telling the truth, as there seems little reason to doubt, there remains the unfathomable problem of MacGuire's motives and veracity. He may have been working both ends against the middle, as Butler at one point suspected. In any case, MacGuire emerged from the HUAC hearings as an inconsequential trickster whose base dealings could not possibly be taken alone as verifying such a momentous undertaking. If he was acting as an intermediary in a genuine probe, or as agent provocateur sent to fool Butler, his employers were at least clever enough to keep their distance and see to it that he self-destructed on the witness stand.\"\n\nIn July 2007, Scott Horton wrote an article in \"Harper's Magazine\" claiming that Prescott Bush, father of US President George H. W. Bush and grandfather of US president George W. Bush, was involved in the 1934 Business Plot.\n\n\n"}

But there does not appear to be any foundation for this assertion. His father, Baron Ludolph Luirdt Ripperda tot Winsum, was a Dutch military commander. In fact, the Ripperdas were one of the oldest and most influential noble families in Groningen, with origins going back to East Frisia. He was born a Roman Catholic and attended a Jesuit School in Cologne, he conformed to Dutch Calvinism in order to obtain his election as delegate to the states-general from Groningen.\n\nIn 1715 he was sent by the Dutch government as ambassador to Madrid. Saint-Simon says that his character for probity was even then considered doubtful. The fortune of Jean Orry, Giulio Alberoni and other foreigners in Spain, showed that the court of Philip V offered a career to adventurers. Ripperda, whose name is commonly spelt de Riperdá by the Spaniards, devoted himself to the Spanish government, and again professed himself a Roman Catholic. He first attached himself to Alberoni, and after the fall of that minister he became the agent of Elizabeth Farnese, the restless and intriguing wife of Philip V. Though perfectly unscrupulous in money matters, and of a singularly vain and blustering disposition, he did understand commercial questions, and he had the merit of having pointed out that the poverty of Spain was mainly due to the neglect of its agriculture. But his fortune was not due to any service of a useful kind he rendered his masters. He rose by undertaking to aid the queen, whose influence over her husband was boundless, in her schemes for securing the succession to Parma and Tuscany for her sons.\n\nRipperda was sent as special envoy to Vienna in 1725 and was elevated to the rank of duke. He behaved outrageously, but the Austrian government, which was under the influence of its own fixed idea, treated him seriously. The result of ten months of very strange diplomacy was the Treaty of Vienna (1725) by which the Emperor promised very little, and the Ostend Company received commercial rights in the Spanish colonies in the Americas. Spain was bound to pay heavy subsidies, which its exhausted treasury was quite unable to afford. The emperor hoped to obtain money. Elizabeth Farnese hoped to secure the Italian duchies for her sons, and some vague stipulations were made that Charles VI should give his aid for the recovery by Spain of Gibraltar and Menorca. When Ripperda returned to Madrid at the close of 1725, he asserted that the emperor expected him to be made prime minister. The Spanish sovereigns, who were overawed by this quite unfounded assertion, allowed him to grasp the most important posts under the crown. He excited the violent hostility of the Spaniards, and entered into a complication of intrigues with the French and British governments.\n\nHis career was short. In 1726 the Austrian envoy, who had vainly pressed for the payment of the promised subsidies, came to an explanation with the Spanish sovereigns. It was discovered that Ripperda had not only made promises that he was not authorized to make, but had misappropriated large sums of money. The sovereigns who had made him duke and grandee shrank from covering themselves with ridicule by revealing the way in which they had been deceived. Ripperda was dismissed with the promise of a pension.\nBeing in terror of the hatred of the Spaniards, he took refuge in the British Embassy. \nTo secure the favor of the British envoy, Colonel William Stanhope, afterwards Lord Harrington, he betrayed the secrets of his government. Stanhope could not protect him, and he was sent as a prisoner to the castle of Segovia.\n\nIn 1728 he escaped, probably with the connivance of the government, and made his way to Holland. His last years are obscure. It is said that he reverted to Protestantism, and then went to Morocco, where he became a Muslim and commanded the Moors in an unsuccessful attack on Ceuta. But this story is founded on his so-called \"Memoirs\", which are in fact a Grub Street tale of adventure published at Amsterdam in 1740. All that is really known is that he did go to Morocco, where he died at Tetuan in 1737.\n\nHe was married twice. His first wife was Aleida van Schellingwoude from whom he inherited the lordships of Poelgeest and Koudekerk. Their son, Ludolph Luirdt, Baron Ripperda also served as Spanish ambassador to Vienna. Their daughter, Maria, married the Spanish Count Balthasar de Argumossa. His second wife was the Spanish lady Francisca de Xarava del Castillo who bore him two sons. The youngest son, Baron Juan María Vicencio de Ripperdá, became a Spanish officer and Governor of Texas and Honduras.\n\nRipperda escaped Spain with the assistance of the servant girl, Josepha Francisca Ramos. She bore him an illegitimate son, Francois Joseph, whose descendants still live near Lingen in Germany and across the United States. There are over 600 descendants in the United States none of whom are formally considered to belong to the House of Ripperda.\n\nAttribution:\n\n"}

It is a pending Boston Landmark.\n\nThe Colonial Theatre was designed by the architectural firm of Clarence Blackall and paid for by Frederick Lothrop Ames, Jr., the theatre first opened its doors for a performance of \"Ben-Hur\" on December 20, 1900 with a sold out show and Winston Churchill attending. \"Ben-Hur\" operated with a cast and crew of 350 people and featured eight live horses on stage in full gallop during the chariot race scene. The play was so mechanically and technically extraordinary, it was featured on the cover of Scientific American.\n\nIn the 1990s, Colonial president Jon Platt led a renovation of the Colonial. In 1998, Platt sold his Boston theater interests to SFX Entertainment (now Live Nation). In 2003, Emerson College leased the building with an option to purchase it.\n\nIn 2006, Emerson invoked its purchase option with the intent of using the upper floors for dormitories. In 2008, Key Brand Entertainment purchased most of Live Nation's theatrical assets, including its lease on the Colonial Theatre. When KBE's lease ended, the Citi Performing Arts Center assumed operation of the venue and continued booking in partnership with KBE.\n\nThrough the succession of operators until 2015, the Colonial Theater housed Pre-Broadway shows and was often the first stop for national tours of Broadway shows. Because of its size, the Colonial can often host highly technical musicals that the smaller houses, such as the Shubert and the Wilbur Theatres, cannot accommodate. The Colonial has also played host to much larger shows such as \"Les Misérables\", but after the renovation of the newly restored Opera House, some of its typical shows performed elsewhere. Nonetheless, the Colonial continued to be a testing ground for Broadway-bound shows.\n\nWhen the Citi lease ended October 15, 2015, Emerson College closed the Colonial to evaluate the use of the structure. Later, the school announced plans to convert the theatre space into a dining hall. After protests from faculty, alumni, historians and theatrical personnel, and over 7,000 signatures on a Change.org petition, including playwright/composer Stephen Sondheim and New York Times theatre critic, Frank Rich, Emerson President M. Lee Pelton announced March 3, 2016, that the college would instead renovate another building into a dining hall and gathering area and seek to bring live performances back to the Colonial.\n\nIn September 2016, Emerson College administration announced it was considering plans from various outside groups to reopen the theater. One of the proposals was from a local consortium, which included Live Nation, the Boston Lyric Opera, Broadway in Boston, and Celebrity Series of Boston with the consortium bringing Broadway shows, musical acts, opera, and more to the theater. There were also proposals internally from the college and from SMG, a Pennsylvania-based venue management group.\n\nThe Colonial has long been a home to both touring productions of Broadway shows, and to previews of shows prior to their Broadway debuts. Notable shows which previewed at the Colonial before opening on Broadway include:\nIn January 2017, Emerson College announced a deal with the London-based Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG) to operate the Colonial Theatre by signing a 40-year lease. In a deal that was partly facilitated by the City of Boston, the college and ATG have both agreed to make substantial capital improvements to the venue which is now to be called the Emerson Colonial Theatre. It reopened in July 2018 featuring the premiere of a new musical, \"Moulin Rouge!\", based on the film by Baz Luhrmann, prior to a possible Broadway run.\n\n\n"}

It was passed to expand participation of Indians in the government of India. The Act embodied the reforms recommended in the report of the Secretary of State for India, Edwin Montagu, and the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford. The Act covered ten years, from 1919 to 1929. This Act represented the end of benevolent despotism (the act of authorities enhancing themselves) and began the genesis of responsible government in India. It was set to be reviewed by the Simon Commission in 10 years. \n\nThe Act received royal assent on 23 December 1919. On the same day the King-Emperor issued a proclamation which reviewed the course of parliamentary legislation for India and the intent of the act: \n\"The Acts of 1773 and 1784 were designed to establish a regular system of administration and justice under the Honourable East India Company. The Act of 1833 opened the door for Indians to public office and employment. The Act of 1858 transferred the administration from the Company to the Crown and laid the foundations of public life which exist in India today.

The Provincial Councils were enlarged.\n\nAt the same time, all other areas of government (the 'reserved list') remained under the control of the Viceroy. The 'reserved list' included defence (the military), foreign affairs, and communications.\n\nThe Imperial Legislative Council was enlarged and reformed. It became a bicameral legislature for all India. The lower house was the Legislative Assembly of 145 members, of which 104 were elected and 41 were nominated, with a tenure of three years. The upper house was the Council of State, consisting of 34 elected and 26 nominated members, with a tenure of five years.\n\nSalient features of the Act were as follows: \n\n\n"}

Some medieval sources list Morlaàs in Béarn, as his birthplace. However, in some records from that period he is called \"Morlanensis\", which would indicate that he was a native of Morlaix in Brittany. A writer in the \"Journal of Theological Studies\" (1907), Volume 8, pages 394-399, contended that he belonged to the family of the seigneurs of Montpellier in Languedoc, and was born at Murles. It is believed that he was at first a monk of Saint-Sauveur d'Aniane and that he entered the monastery of Cluny during the administration of Abbot Pons (1109–1122).\n\nBernard is best known as the author of \"De contemptu mundi\" (\"On Contempt for the World\"), a 3,000 verse poem of stinging satire directed against the secular and religious failings he observed in the world around him.

It was outlined during the Finnish Civil War, on 29 January 1918 by the Finnish People's Delegation, the Reds and Red Guards of the Finnish Social Democratic Party, after the socialist revolution in Finland on 26 January 1918.\n\nThe name \"Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic\" (\"Suomen sosialistinen työväentasavalta\") appeared only in the Treaty between Finnish People's Delegation and Russian Council of People's Commissars, signed 1 March 1918. The People's Delegation had earlier used the name Republic of Finland (\"Suomen tasavalta\"), but Soviet leader V. I. Lenin proposed adding the attributes \"Socialist Workers' Republic\" into the name during negotiations. The People's Delegation later blamed its delegates for succumbing to Lenin's demand, since the official name of the state should have been decided by the Finns themselves.\n\nRed Finland/FSWR was an attempt to establish a socialist nation, based on the legacy of Scandinavian-Finnish culture, socialist ideas originating from Central Europe and Finnish nationalism, including plans to expand the Finnish territory. The political visions included principles of democracy, but as Red Finland was primarily the formation of revolution and civil war, the acts of violence and warfare were emphasized in the policy. The Red Guards included a minor faction of Finnish Bolsheviks who supported association of FSWR to Soviet Russia. FSWR/Red Finland never gained a true status and form of state and republic as the Reds lost the Civil War on 5 May 1918.\n\nThe geographical area of Red Finland as well as the front line between White and Red Finland took shape approximately between 28 January and 3 February 1918, and it remained largely unchanged until the general offensive of the Whites in March 1918.\n\nThe Finnish People's Delegation, mainly Otto Ville Kuusinen, formulated and set forth, on 23 February 1918, a draft for a constitution of Red Finland/FSWR, on the basis of the Finnish Social Democratic principles and mentality. The Marxist concept of dictatorship of the proletariat was absent from the program. Instead, it represented an idea of \"democratic socialism\" and it was influenced by the constitutions of Switzerland and United States, and French Revolution. The constitution model included most of democratic civil rights for the Finnish citizens, including an extensive use of referendum in political decision making, but private property rights were excluded and given to state and local administration. The draft was never finally formulated and approved in Red Finland, before the defeat of FSWR in the 1918 war.\n\nThe power political situation after the \"January Revolution\" in Finland raised a major question in terms of the constitution draft, among the Finnish (moderate) socialists: would the power gained via revolution allow democracy a true chance in Finnish society? Finally, political terror, carried out by the Red Guards during the Finnish civil war, led to marked controversy between the principles of democracy and the situation in the country.\n\nAlthough the Finnish Socialist Worker's Republic was supported by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), led by Vladimir Lenin, and the 1 March 1918 Red Treaty was signed between these two unstable socialist states, an ideal level of co-operation and co-ordination was never achieved, due to both states being preoccupied with their own respective civil wars. The goal of the Finnish Reds' majority was a neutral and independent Finland, and some of them demanded annexation of Aunus, Viena Karelia and Petsamo areas of Russian Karelia to Finland. The Russian-Finnish Red treaty had only minor importance for the Bolsheviks as they carried out peace negotiations with the German Empire. In the end, the fate of the Finnish Reds and FSWR was determined through the power political decisions made between Russia and Germany.\n\nLenin aimed to halt a complete collapse of Russia after the revolutionary year 1917. While in political opposition prior to the October Revolution, Lenin emphasized the policy of nations' right to self-determination for the former parts of the Russian Empire. After the successful seizure of power in October 1917 and in January 1918, the Bolsheviks' power political strategy shifted gradually toward federalism. As for Finland, Lenin plotted its annexation by Russia, but the Russian Civil War, German-Russian Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Finland-operation of the German Army, the victory of the White Guards in the Finnish civil war and the marked nationalism among the Finnish socialists stalled his plan.\n\nThe warfare between the Reds and Whites took major attention and energy of the Red leadership. Therefore, formation of the local Red civil administration remained unfinished and waited for the result of the Civil War. The top and middle-rank civil servants of the pre-civil war administration refused to co-operate with the Reds, and a new leadership had to be chosen and trained from the lower rank servants.\n\nThe Finnish Civil War ended with the German invasion of Finland and the consequent defeat of the Finnish Red Guards and FSWR on 5 May 1918. After the war, the initially powerful and well-organized Finnish Social Democrats, born and bred in the relatively free and nationalistic social atmosphere, within the Scandinavian and Russian culture, and affected primarily by socialist ideas of Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia (pre-World War I Austria-Hungary), were split in two. The moderate socialists continued their pre-1918 political culture, adhered to the society and political system of Finland, while the far-left faction formed the Communist Party of Finland in August 1918 in Moscow, with the main leaders living in exile in Russia and a marked part of the common supporters living in Finland.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a 3,000 verse poem of stinging satire directed against the secular and religious failings he observed in the world around him. He spares no one; priests, nuns, bishops, monks, and even Rome itself are mercilessly scourged for their shortcomings. For this reason it was first printed by Matthias Flacius in \"Varia poemata de corrupto ecclesiae statu\" (Basle, 1557) as one of his \"testes veritatis\", or witnesses of the deep-seated corruption of medieval society and of the Church, and was often reprinted by Protestants in the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. \n\nThis Christian version of the Satires of Juvenal does not proceed in an orderly manner against the vices and follies of his age. It has been well said that Bernard eddies about two main points: the transitory character of all material pleasures and the permanency of spiritual joys), the same themes as a much earlier treatise of the same name by Eucherius of Lyon, which Erasmus had edited and republished at Basle in 1520.\n\nHis highly wrought pictures of heaven and hell were probably known to Dante; the roasting cold, the freezing fire, the devouring worm, the fiery floods, and again the glorious idyl of the Golden Age and the splendours of the Heavenly Kingdom are couched in a diction that rises at times to the height of Dante's genius. The enormity of sin, the charm of virtue, the torture of an evil conscience, the sweetness of a God-fearing life alternate with heaven and hell as the themes of his majestic dithyramb. He returns again and again to the wickedness of woman (one of the fiercest arraignments of the sex), the evils of wine, money, learning, perjury, soothsaying, etc.. This master of an elegant, forceful, and abundant Latinity cannot find words strong enough to convey his prophetic rage at the moral apostasy of his generation. Youthful and simoniacal bishops, oppressive agents of ecclesiastical corporations, the officers of the Curia, papal legates, and the pope himself are treated with no less severity than in Dante or in the sculptures of medieval cathedrals.\n\nThe early half of the twelfth century saw the appearance of several new factors of secularism unknown to an earlier and more simply religious time: the increase of commerce and industry resultant from the Crusades, the growing independence of medieval cities, the secularization of Benedictine life, the development of pageantry and luxury in a hitherto rude feudal world, the reaction from the terrible conflict of State and Church in the latter half of the 11th century. The song of the Cluniac is a great cry of pain wrung from a deeply religious and even mystical soul at the first dawning consciousness of a new order of human ideals and aspirations. The poet-preacher is also a prophet; Antichrist, he says, is born in Spain; Elijah has come to life again in the Orient. The last days are at hand, and it behoves the true Christian to awake and be ready for the dissolution of an order now grown intolerable, in which religion itself is henceforth represented by cant and hypocrisy.\n\nThe metre of this poem is no less remarkable than its diction; it is a dactylic hexameter in three sections, with mostly bucolic caesura alone, with tailed rhymes and a feminine leonine rhyme between the two first sections; the verses are technically known as \"leonini cristati trilices dactylici\", and are so difficult to construct in great numbers that the writer claims divine inspiration (the impulse and inflow of the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding) as the chief agency in the execution of so long an effort of this kind. The poem begins:\n\nIt is, indeed, a solemn and stately verse, rich and sonorous, not meant, however, to be read at one sitting, at the risk of surfeiting the appetite. Bernard of Cluny is an erudite writer, and his poem leaves an excellent impression of the Latin culture of the twelfth century Benedictine monasteries and Catholicism in France in general.\n\nSeven hundred years later Richard Trench published the initial stanzas of the poem, beginning \"Urbs Sion aurea, patria lactea,\" in his \"Sacred Latin Poetry\" (1849). John Mason Neale translated this portion of the poem into English and published it under the title \"Jerusalem the Golden\" in his \"Medieval Hymns and Sequences\" (1851). Neale made revisions and additions to his earlier free translation when he published it in his \"The Rhythm of Bernard\" (1858). A number of well-known modern hymns, including \"Jerusalem the Golden\"; \"Brief Life is Here Our Portion\"; \"The World Is Very Evil\"; and \"For Thee, O Dear, Dear Country\", are translations of parts of this famous poem. The text found in the Psalter Hymnal is the most popular of the four hymns derived from Neale's translation.\n\nAmerican composer Horatio Parker composed an oratorio utilizing text from Bernard of Cluny's poem, \"Hora novissima\", in 1893.\n\n"}

Heap also composed the music for the West End play, \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\", which premiered in the summer of 2016, and which opened on Broadway in April 2018.\n\n, Heap has received two Grammy Awards, one Ivor Novello Award, and one Drama Desk Award. In July 2019, Heap was awarded an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music.\n\nImogen Jennifer Heap was born in the London Borough of Havering. She played music from an early age, becoming classically trained in several instruments including piano, cello and clarinet. She attended Friends School, a private, Quaker-run boarding school in Saffron Walden. Heap's mother (an art therapist) and her father (a construction rock retailer) separated when she was twelve. By the age of thirteen, she had begun writing songs.\n\nHeap did not get along well with the music teacher at her boarding school, so she principally taught herself sequencing, music engineering, sampling and production (on Atari computers). She also taught herself to play the guitar and drums, and subsequently two percussion/idiophone instruments, the array mbira and the Hang. After school, she went on to study at the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology in Croydon, South London.\n\nAfter being introduced to Nik Kershaw by his manager Mickey Modern, Heap and Kershaw recorded four demos that Modern took to Rondor Music. Subsequently, a few months later she signed her first record contract, aged 18, with independent record label Almo Sounds. Modern and Mark Wood formed Modernwood Management, and managed Heap until 2006, when Modernwood was dissolved. Wood continues to manage the artist via his new company, Radius Music.\n\nDuring 1996, Heap began working with an experimental pop band called Acacia, which featured her future collaborator Guy Sigsworth and was fronted by the singer Alexander Nilere. While never a full member of the band, Heap was a guest vocalist (as a counterpart to Nilere) and contributed to various Acacia single and album tracks. One Acacia song, \"Maddening Shroud\", would later be covered by Frou Frou.\n\nModern asked Dennis Arnold to place Heap in the line-up in the 1996 Prince's Trust Concert in Hyde Park, London organised by Harvey Goldsmith. Heap performed four songs between sets by The Who and Eric Clapton.\n\nHeap's debut album, \"iMegaphone\" (an anagram of \"Imogen Heap\") was a mixture of self-penned and self-produced tracks, alongside tracks co-written and produced with established producers such as David Kahne, former Eurythmic Dave Stewart, and Guy Sigsworth. The album was released in 1998 internationally via Almo Sounds, to favourable reviews comparing Heap's angst-filled songs to work by PJ Harvey, Kate Bush, Chrissie Hynde, Siouxsie Sioux, and Annie Lennox. Promotion for the record included a tour of America and performances around Europe. Three singles were commercially released in the UK: \"Getting Scared\", \"Shine\" and \"Come Here Boy\". \"Oh Me, Oh My\" was sent to US radio stations in place of \"Shine\".\n\nHeap's early success was soon replaced by problems. Almo Sounds cut funding for UK promotion and gave Heap a deadline to deliver songs for her second album. Upon delivery of the songs, she was told that they lacked \"hit potential\". It was announced that the record label would be sold to Universal and its artists moved to other labels or released. Heap was one of the artists who was dropped from the label, leaving her without a record contract. \"iMegaphone\" had, however, been licensed from Almo Sounds to Aozora Records in Japan, who eventually re-released and re-promoted the album in January 2002, featuring \"Blanket\" and \"Aeroplane\" (a Frou Frou remix/remake of one of her B-sides, \"Airplane\" of the \"Shine\" single released in 1998). The album featured new packaging, all-new artwork, and a previously unavailable hidden track, entitled \"Kidding\", recorded live during her 1999 tour.\n\nCopies of the original Almo Sounds release remain rare. A Brazilian label, Trama Records, currently claims to hold the licence to the record and has started re-printing copies of the album in limited quantities. The album was released digitally on the US iTunes Music Store in early 2006. After achieving commercial success with her work with Guy Sigsworth as the duo Frou Frou and her second solo album, \"Speak for Yourself\", Heap was able to secure the re-release of \"iMegaphone\".\n\nIn the gap between the end of promotion for \"iMegaphone\" internationally and the re-promotion, Heap had also begun to think about her second solo album, and had started writing songs, both solo, as well as working with Guy Sigsworth; however, as she was without a record deal, the songs were shelved. During the time when she was unsigned, Heap appeared on two UK singles, \"Meantime\" (a track written by her former Acacia colleagues Guy Sigsworth and Alexander Nilere for the soundtrack to the independent British film, \"\") and \"Blanket\" (a 1998 collaboration with Urban Species). In 2000, Heap sang on two tracks of the album \"You Had It Coming\" by Jeff Beck.\n\nHeap had kept in contact with Guy Sigsworth (who had co-written and produced \"Getting Scared\" from \"iMegaphone\") and this led to the pair of them establishing the collaborative project Frou Frou.\n\nThe initial concept for Frou Frou was Sigsworth's, and the project was to have been an album written and produced by her with each track featuring a different singer, songwriter, poet or rapper. Heap explains that Sigsworth invited her over to his studio to write lyrics to a four-bar motif he had, with one condition – that she include the word \"love\" somewhere. The first line she came up with was \"lung of love, leaves me breathless\", and the \"Details\" album track, \"Flicks\" was written. A week later, Sigsworth called Heap again, and together they wrote and recorded the future single \"Breathe In\".\n\nIn August 2002, they released the \"Details\" album and singles \"Breathe In\", \"It's Good To Be in Love\", and \"Must Be Dreaming\" (although the latter two were not commercially available). The album was critically acclaimed, but did not enjoy the commercial success that they had been hoping for until 2004 when the song \"Let Go\" became a hit from the Garden State soundtrack.\n\nIn late 2003, after an extensive promotional tour of the UK, Europe and the US, the duo were told that their record label, Island Records would not be picking up the option for a second album.\n\nHeap and Sigsworth remain firm friends, and have worked together since the project, including their temporary re-formation in late 2003, when they covered the Bonnie Tyler classic, \"Holding Out for a Hero\", which was featured during the credits of the movie \"Shrek 2\" after Jennifer Saunders' version in the film. Frou Frou saw a resurgence in popularity in 2004, when their album track \"Let Go\" was featured in the film \"Garden State\", the soundtrack of which won a Grammy award.\n\nIn a 2005 interview, Heap said of Frou Frou \"(it) was really like a kind of little holiday from my own work. Guy and I, we have always worked together, and then over the years, it became clear that we wanted to do a whole album together. It was very organic and spontaneous — just one of those wonderful things that happens. But there was never a mention of a second record from either of us, and not uncomfortably. We're just both kind of free spirits. I love to work with a lot of different people, but I was also just gagging to see what I could do on my own. But I'm sure in the future, Guy and I will get back together to do another record, or to record a few songs together.\"\n\nIn December 2003, Heap announced on her website that she was going to write and produce her second solo album, using her site as a blog to publicise progress.\n\nHeap set herself a deadline of one year to make the album, booking a session to master the album one year ahead in December 2004. She re-mortgaged her flat to fund production costs, including renting a studio at Atomic Studios, London (previously inhabited by UK grime artist, Dizzee Rascal), and purchasing instruments.\n\nAt the end of 2004, with the album completed, Heap premièred two album tracks online, selling them prior to the album's release – \"Just for Now\" and \"Goodnight and Go\".\n\nIn April 2005, \"The O.C.\" featured the vocoded-vocal track, \"Hide and Seek\" in the closing scenes of their season two finale. The track was released immediately to digital download services, such as iTunes, in the US, where it charted and on the UK Billboard charts where it was #22. The track was released to iTunes UK on 5 July 2005 (the same day as the UK airing of the season finale) and entered the official UK download chart. The song has since been certified gold by the RIAA.\n\nHeap released the album on her own record company, Megaphonic Records. The album was titled \"Speak for Yourself\".\n\n\"Speak for Yourself\" was released in the UK on 18 July 2005 on CD and iTunes UK, where it entered the top 10 chart. The initial 10,000 physical copies pressed sold out, distributed through large and independent record stores and Heap's own online shop.\n\nIn August 2005, Heap announced that she had licensed \"Speak for Yourself\" to RCA Records, for the album's release in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The album was released in November 2005 and débuted at number 144 in the Billboard Top 200 album chart. In concert, Heap performed solo, controlling the sound through her laptop, as well as singing and playing the piano and array mbira.\n\nShe returned from the US, already having sold over 120,000 copies.\n\nHeap also announced, on her return to the UK, that she had signed a deal for the album to be released internationally, as well as re-promoted in the UK, with a new imprint of Sony BMG, White Rabbit, run by former Sony BMG UK A&R vice president Nick Raphael.\n\n\"Speak for Yourself\" was re-released on the label on 24 April 2006, ahead of a full promotional push on 15 May, a week after the second single, \"Goodnight and Go\", was commercially released in the UK.\n\nIn August 2006, Heap performed a set at the V Festival, where it was announced that \"Headlock\" was to be the third single to be lifted from the album, and released on 16 October 2006 in the UK.\n\nIn late September and early October, Heap embarked on a tour of the UK, holding a competition on MySpace for different support acts for each venue, before touring throughout Canada and the US in November and December. This was her first tour of North America that included a band, incorporating upright bass, percussion, and support acts Kid Beyond and Levi Weaver on beatbox and guitar, respectively. In December 2006, Heap was featured on the front page of \"The Green Room\" magazine.\n\nOn 7 December 2006, Heap received two Grammy nominations for the 49th Annual Grammy Awards, one for Best New Artist and the other for Best Song Written For Motion Picture, Television Or Other Visual Media for \"Can't Take It In\".\n\nThroughout the creation of her album \"Ellipse\", Heap posted vlogs, or VBlogs as she called them, through YouTube.\nShe used these to comment on the album as well as update on its release.\nThe album's release was pushed back multiple times.\nThese included Heap being asked to perform at the annual event PopTech in October 2008. During the event, she premiered one of her album's songs, \"Wait it Out\".\n\nHeap announced on her Twitter page that \"Ellipse\"'s first single would be \"First Train Home\".\n\nOn 17 August 2009 Heap made the entire album \"Ellipse\" available for live streaming via her webpage.\n\n\"Ellipse\" was released in the United Kingdom on 24 August, and in the United States on 25 August.\n\nOn 15 January 2010, Heap accepted the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical for her engineering work on \"Ellipse\".\n\nOn 14 March 2011, Heap started work on her next album, \"Sparks\" (then unnamed), as fans sent in nearly 900 \"sound seeds\", or samples of everyday sounds such as a \"dishwasher door\", a \"bicycle\" or a \"burning match\". Heap said the concept for this album was to record one track over a two-week period every three months, with each song and video to be released immediately. According to her website, the album would be completed in roughly three years.\n\nThe first song, initially entitled \"#heapsong1\" and later retitled \"Lifeline\", premiered worldwide on 28 March 2011 via Ustream along with a live remix by Tim Exile. \"Lifeline\" was released on 30 March 2011 as a digital download from Heap's website and via iTunes, Amazon and other digital retailers. Released alongside this was a 12-page 3DiCD package (a 3D virtual CD) including crowd sourced (and paid for) images, the instrumental version of the song, the \"seeds and solos only\" version and \"heap speaks seeds and solos\" - an-18-minute commentary by Heap on how the sounds and solos were used in \"Lifeline\".\n\nOn 6 May 2011, Heap tweeted that she and deadmau5 were working on a collaboration. The song was titled \"Telemiscommunications\" and was included in deadmau5's sixth studio album, \"Album Title Goes Here\".\n\nOn 9 September 2012, Heap wrote and released a track, \"Someone's Calling\", recorded especially for use as a ringtone.\n\n\nHeap's fourth album, \"Sparks\", was released on 18 August 2014.\n\nIn the \"Sparks\" box set, the Heapsongs are labelled in production order as:\n\nOn her \"Sparks\" vblog #5, she announced that she will take hiatus after the birth of her baby thus she won't tour promoting \"Sparks\" at least for a year.\n\nOn 2 October 2015, Heap announced that she would be releasing her single \"Tiny Human\" using blockchain technology during a Guardian Live livestream event. In a panel after performing a stripped-down version of \"Tiny Human\" with cellist Zoë Keating, Heap explained that she was releasing her single along with other content via the concept of Mycelia—a way for artists to share their music as well as enforce smart contracts via blockchain-based technology like Ethereum. Sales of \"Tiny Human\" via Ethereum smart contracts as of October 2017 were £30,000.\n\nHeap wrote the music for \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\", the next instalment of the Harry Potter series in the form of a West End play that opened in the summer of 2016.\n\nIn 2015, Heap signed a worldwide agreement with Downtown Music Publishing. The deal covers Heap's portion of Taylor Swift's fifth studio album \"1989\" finale \"Clean,\" plus five songs from Heap's 2014 album, \"Sparks\": \"The Beast\", \"Entanglement\", \"Climb to Sakteng\", \"Run-Time\", and \"Cycle Song\". Her participation in \"1989\" led her to become part of the production team that won Album of the Year at the 2016 Grammy Awards.\n\nHeap was one of the featured artists on the 2016 PBS documentary on music, \"Soundbreaking\".\n\nIn 2016, Heap was commissioned to write \"The Happy Song\". The concept was to \"create something to make babies even happier\". Heap's daughter Scout (who was almost two years old) was a collaborator and inspiration for the melody. As the music was being developed, it was scientifically tested by Goldsmiths, University of London with 26 babies to find the ideal melody, speed and attractive samples for the song.\n\nIn July 2018, Heap confirmed a new album has been finished, but that she is struggling with contract issues.\n\nHeap also produced the end credits song \"The Quiet\" for the Square Enix title \"The Quiet Man\".\n\nFor her solo work, as well as her work with Frou Frou and Acacia, Heap plays heavily produced and arranged pop incorporating elements of rock, dance and electronica. As a guest player and collaborator she has played rock (Jeff Beck), hip-hop (Urban Species) and theatre/film music.\n\nHeap extensively uses manipulated electronic sounds as an integral part of her music. She also mixes ambient sound into her music (such as the sound of a frying pan in use cooking food, in the background of her song \"Hide and Seek\") and has commented that \"certain sounds give the music a width and a space, and that's important.\"\n\nHeap states that her song lyrics come from personal experience, but are not straightforwardly confessional. She has stated \"Most of the time, the lyrics are kind of like my secret messages to my friends or my boyfriend or my mum or my dad. I would never tell them that these songs are about them or which specific lyric is about somebody. Often, when I sit down to write a lyric, it is in the heat of the moment, and something has just happened.\"\n\nHeap has recorded several songs for films, including a cover of the Classics IV hit \"Spooky\" for the soundtrack to the Reese Witherspoon film \"Just Like Heaven\". Her song \"Hide and Seek\" was featured in \"The Last Kiss\", starring Zach Braff (who used her former band Frou Frou's \"Let Go\" in his 2004 film \"Garden State\"), and was also used in a 2007 episode of \"Saturday Night Live\", hosted by Shia LaBeouf. \"The Moment I Said It\" was also used in the episode \"Seven Seconds\" of the CBS crime drama \"Criminal Minds\".\n\nIn 2004, while recording her second solo album, she was commissioned to record a cover of a short nursery rhyme for the HBO television series, \"Six Feet Under\", entitled \"I'm a Lonely Little Petunia (In an Onion Patch)\".\n\nIn late 2005, Heap was asked to write a track for the of \"\" entitled \"Can't Take It In\", when a track that fellow Brit singer Dido submitted was deemed unfitting. Heap's track is played at the end of the film in an orchestral version produced by Heap and Harry Gregson Williams, who scored the movie. In addition, she composed a track for the film \"\", but it was deemed to be too dark in tone for the film. Instead, it was included in her album \"Ellipse\" as \"2-1\". 2-1 has also featured in \"CSI Miami\" (Season 8 Episode 9), as well as promotional trailers for the film \"The Lovely Bones\".\n\nIn March 2006, Heap completed a track about locusts, entitled \"Glittering Cloud\", for a CD of music about the plagues of Egypt entitled \"Plague Songs\", accompanying The Margate Exodus project, for musical director Brian Eno.\n\nHeap recorded an a cappella version of the Leonard Cohen track \"Hallelujah\", for the season three finale of \"The O.C.\", and her \"Not Now But Soon\" was included on the original soundtrack for the NBC show, \"Heroes\". Heap's song \"Hide & Seek\" was used in the season two finale of \"The O.C.\".\n\nImogen Heap and Frou Frou songs have been featured in various TV shows, movies, advertisements, and marching band productions, notably including \", Chuck, The OC, Saturday Night Live, Garden State\", \"The Holiday\", and \"So You Think You Can Dance\". \"Hide & Seek\" was sampled in Jason Derulo's single \"Whatcha Say\" which peaked at #1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Frou Frou track \"Shh\" was also used extensively for TV promotions during the fifth season of \"Gilmore Girls\".\n\nHeap has collaborated as a guest vocalist, co-writer, remixer or producer with many various artists throughout her career. Among them co-writing and producing \"By The Time\" for Mika and \"Now or Never\" for Josh Groban. The diverse range of other musicians Heap has worked with include IAMX, Jeff Beck, Jon Bon Jovi, Mich Gerber, Sean Lennon, Thomas Dolby, Urban Species, Matt Willis, Ariana Grande, Jon Hopkins, Acacia, Britney Spears, Nik Kershaw, Blue October, Joshua Radin, Nitin Sawhney, deadmau5, and Taylor Swift.\n\nHeap is an advocate of using technology to interact and collaborate with her fans. In August 2009 she used Vokle, an online auditorium, to take questions from listeners over video chat.\n\nHeap also teamed up with Vokle to hold open cello auditions for her North American tour. She provided sheet music for \"Aha\" on her website and encouraged local fans to learn the part and audition live via Vokle. Heap would then pick the cellist to accompany her for that particular city – sometimes with the help of viewers and her puppet lion, Harold. In 2010 Heap opened her online auditions to singers and choirs and invited them to audition via submitted YouTube videos to accompany her on stage as she performed the song \"Earth\" from \"Ellipse\". The winner of each local show was also invited to do a 15-minute gig of their own. In the studio, the official album recording of \"Earth\" was made up entirely of numerous tracks of vocals.\n\nJuly 2011 saw Heap unveil a pair of in-development, high-tech musical gloves at the TEDGlobal conference in Edinburgh, Scotland. Inspired by the VAMP system developed by Elly Jessop at MIT's media lab, Heap set out to develop the musical gloves in collaboration with Thomas Mitchell, a lecturer in music systems at the University of the West of England, Bristol. The gloves combine sensors developed by 5DT, x-io Technologies with Shure microphones. Both Heap's and Elly Jessop's musical gloves are similar to The Lady's Glove, an earlier invention by the electronic sound pioneer Laetitia Sonami, and the midi gloves used since 1989 by Steve Hogarth lead singer of Marillion. While still in prototype stage, Heap used her MiMu gloves to record \"Me the Machine\", the first song created solely with the gloves. The song was released on her latest album, Sparks, originally titled \"heapsong11\". In an attempt to raise money for further research, Heap toured the song and the gloves at a number of venues and has been working with artists to discover the full potential of the gloves.\n\nOn 5 October 2015, Heap released her single \"Tiny Human\" on Mycelia: an experimental music distribution platform using blockchain-based technology called Ethereum alongside other open source platforms like Ujo.\n\nIn 2008, she participated in a music album called \"\", which is an initiative to support Tibet, Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso and to underline the human rights situation in Tibet. The album was issued on 5 August via iTunes and on 19 August in music stores around the world. On 12 October 2008, Heap also participated in \"Run 10k: Cancer Research UK,\" placing fifth of the women in the actual run and raising over £1000 for the cause with the help of her fans.\n\nIn 2008, Heap was asked to perform at POP!Tech in Camden, Maine (US). There she performed selections from her then-forthcoming album \"Ellipse\". After her set and an encouraging plea for another performance later in the conference by the audience and organisers, Heap agreed. Having nothing else prepared though, she decided to improvise a song on the spot with parameters (tempo, key) suggested by the audience. After the show, Heap was asked by a Poptech attendee if she would give the newly created piece of music to his charity. A \"lightbulb\" moment occurred in Heap's head and she saw the potential in doing these improvised pieces for local charities at each show during the tour she would soon begin.\n\nThe first of these songs materialised at Heap's show at Shepherd's Bush Empire, in London on 19 February 2010. Using the same parameters and audience participation from POP!Tech, Heap improvised a song titled, \"The Shepherdess\". After the show, Heap made the song available worldwide as a digital download on her website asking for donations per download. All proceeds went to the Great Ormond Street Hospital where Heap was diagnosed with osteomyelitis and underwent life-saving surgery as a little girl. Loving the concept, Heap rolled this out for her North American Tour, donating all the proceeds for each song to a local charity from that city.\n\nIn 2011, Heap played a benefit concert in Christchurch, New Zealand, to help rebuild the Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti High School following a severe earthquake which destroyed a large portion of the city earlier in the year. The concert was held at the Burnside High Aurora Centre, also featuring performances from Roseanna Gamlen-Greene, and The Harbour Union including The Eastern, Lindon Puffin, Delaney Davidson and The Unfaithful Ways. It was her only New Zealand show for the year.\n\nOn 4 June 2017, Heap performed at One Love Manchester, a benefit concert organised by Ariana Grande in response to the bombing after her concert at Manchester Arena two weeks earlier. She performed \"Hide and Seek\".\n\nIn 2010, Imogen Heap partnered with Thomas Ermacora of Bubbletank to organise a series of online charitable events called \"Live 4 X\".\n\nThe initial event was inspired by the 2010 Pakistan floods. Triggered by monsoon rains, the floods left approximately one-fifth of the country of Pakistan under water, affecting over 14 million people and damaging or destroying over 900,000 homes. Teaming up with Richard Branson’s Virgin Unite and Vokle.com, Heap and Ermacora create an online webcast/fundraiser to raise awareness and money for the flood-stricken. Hosted by comedian, creative, and internet personality Ze Frank, the webcast included a series of conversations with Cameron Sinclair of Architecture for Humanity, Gary Slutkin, and Anders Wilhelmson, (and later Richard Branson and Mary Robinson) with live performances by musicians Ben Folds, Amanda Palmer, Kate Havnevik, KT Tunstall, Josh Groban, Kaki King, Zoe Keating and Mark Isham.\n\nThe premise of \"Live 4 X\" thus established, Heap has since continued to refine the model, organize, host, and perform a number of charitable, streaming-live, concert events. By integrating live entertainment with educated discussion and technology, \"Live 4 X\" became an effective charitable outreach tool.\n\nFollowing the devastating Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami of 2011, Heap told Washington Times Communities journalist and recording artist Jennifer Grassman, that she intended to continue organising \"Live 4 X\" events to benefit various charitable causes.\n\nCatalogue of \"Live 4 X\" events to date:\n\nOn 4 June 2017, Heap participated in Ariana Grande's One Love Manchester concert, to raise money to help the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing, which took place after one of Grande's concerts. Other celebrity participants included Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, Niall Horan, Coldplay, Miley Cyrus and Pharrell Williams.\n\nAfter touring for nearly two years straight for her album \"Speak for Yourself\", Heap continued her travels, this time with only a laptop and video camera on hand, as she began her writing trip for her next album. Nine weeks later she returned to the UK with the beginnings of the award-winning \"Ellipse\" and footage (as requested by a fan to film the making of the album) from its quiet beginning. Back in Essex, Heap hired Justine Pearsall to document the creation of the album. The film documents the creation of the album and the renovation of Heap's childhood home, including turning her old playroom into her new home studio. \"Everything In-Between: The Story of Ellipse\" was released in November 2010.\n\nOn 5 November 2010 at the Royal Albert Hall, Heap conducted an orchestra (including friends and family) as they performed an original composition by Heap herself orchestrated by Andrew Skeet. Heap also worked with London Contemporary Voices at this time, a scratch choir formed for this concert, which continues as a new choir in its own right. It was the score to the concept film Love The Earth – in which fans were invited to submit video footage highlighting all the qualities of nature to be selected and edited into a film. This performance was broadcast live worldwide.\n\nIn March, for the Birds Eye View Film Festival at the Southbank Centre, Heap, in collaboration with Andrew Skeet composed an a capella choral score for the first-ever surrealist film ‘The Seashell and the Clergyman’ (Germaine Dulac, 1927) with the Holst Singers, a programme repeated at the Reverb Festival at the Roundhouse in February 2012 and in the Sage, Gateshead.\n\nHeap also performed in the Film and Music Arena at Latitude Festival in 2011.\n\nIn 2014, filmmaker Christopher Ian Smith made \"Cumulus\", an experimental documentary exploring key elements of Heap's background, personality and music practice. Crafted entirely out of social media content and data created by Heap and her fans, \"Cumulus\" explores Imogen's digital footprint and identity as well as her relationship with fans. The film is available to view online.\n\nOn 30 June 2014, Heap announced in her video blog that she was pregnant with her first child with partner Michael Lebor. She gave birth to their daughter, Florence Scout Rosie Heap-Lebor, on 8 November 2014.\n\nHeap's sister, Juliet, was killed in a cycling accident in Patagonia on 30 November 2019.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He has won five ATP Tour doubles titles, and reached career-high rankings of singles world No. 67 in April 2008 and doubles world No. 38 in November 2014.\n\nGuccione is of Italian descent on his father's side. He was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder. He is married to Andra Kucerak, with whom he has two children.\n\nGuccione is coached by countryman and former ATP professional Anthony Lane. Guccione is noted for his good service; he hit 50 aces in a three-set qualifying match at Wimbledon in 2005. The good service has led fellow Australian player Mark Philippoussis to call him a \"Wayne Arthurs clone\". He is a serve-and-volley player. Despite these strong assets in the game he has still yet to win any ATP titles and very rarely makes it past the first round of major tournaments. During his career, he has won 5 ATP Challenger Series: hardcourt victories in Burnie and Canberra in 2005, clay court victories in 2006 at Quito and Medellín, and a victory on hardcourt at Aptos in 2009. \n\nHe has had greater success as a doubles player, often partnering with fellow Australians Carsten Ball and Sam Groth. Guccione has represented his country in several Davis Cup ties, compiling a winning record. In a 2011 tie against Switzerland, for example, he teamed with Lleyton Hewitt to beat the Olympic gold medal-winning team of Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka.\n\nGuccione burst onto the scene at the 2004 Medibank International tournament, where he defeated former World No. 1 (and then-World No. 3) Juan Carlos Ferrero 6–3, 7–6. At that time Guccione was not even ranked in the top 400. Despite this momentous victory, he lost to world no. 32 Wayne Ferreira of South Africa 7–6, 7–5 in the second round. In the Australian Open he won his first round match against Australia's Alun Jones 6–3, 7–6, 6–2. He was eliminated in the next round by American Robby Ginepri 6–4, 6–3, 6–3. In November, he won the first singles tournament of his career in Berri, South Australia. He defeated fellow Australian Robert Smeets in straight sets 6–4, 6–4 in the final. \n\nGuccione's first tournament of the year was the Australian Open. He played world no. 12 Guillermo Cañas and lost in straight sets 6–4, 6–2, 7–6. In February, Guccione won his first Challenger title of his career in Burnie, defeating Gouichi Motomura of Japan 6–3, 7–5. In April 2005 at Canberra, he won another Challenger title after he defeated Germany's Lars Übel 7–5, 6–1 in the final. His next tournament was the French Open. It was his first French Open of his career. Despite this, he defeated Spain's Santiago Ventura in the first round 6–3, 2–6, 6–1, 3–6, 6–2. He was knocked out in the second round by home-favourite Paul-Henri Mathieu 6–3, 6–4, 6–4. He did not participate in any more grand slams in 2005. \n\nIn January 2006 Guccione managed to once again defeat Juan Carlos Ferrero at the Medibank International. In February 2006, Guccione won the deciding fifth and final rubber against Switzerland's George Bastl in the Davis Cup. He continued this Davis Cup success in April at Kooyong in Victoria when he defeated his more experienced opponent, Max Mirnyi, in the opening Quarter-final tie against Belarus. Despite winning all but one of his 2006 Davis Cup matches, Guccione was dropped from the Australian Davis Cup Team to make way for the returning Mark Philippoussis. \n\nGuccione began his 2007 season in Adelaide with a wildcard entry at the Next Generation Adelaide International. There, he beat world number 93, Amer Delic 4–6, 6–3, 6–4, world number 58 Benjamin Becker 7–5, 6–3, and world number 42 Arnaud Clément 7–6, 7–6. Reaching his first ATP quarterfinal—the only Australian to do so in Adelaide—Guccione continued his run and upset number 2 seed and world number 18 Richard Gasquet in the quarterfinals 1–6, 6–3, 7–6 to reach his first ATP semifinal. In the semi-finals, he defeated another first-time semifinalist, 92nd ranked Juan Martín del Potro 5–7, 6–3, 7–5, to reach his first ever career ATP tour final, where he lost to Novak Djokovic of Serbia in the final 6–3, 6–7, 6–4, ending his run of victories over top-100 ranked players at five.\n\nAfter success at the Adelaide International Guccione reached a ranking of 107 in the world. Guccione began his second tournament of 2007 in the Medibank International beating Rafael Nadal in the first round. Leading 6–5 with Nadal to serve, Nadal withdrew due to an injury.\n\nGuccione was unable to continue his success into the Australian Open, losing in the first round to Belgian Olivier Rochus 3–6, 7–6, 7–6, 6–7 9–7. Guccione's 2007 season then turned disastrous, not recording one win for over a month, Guccione then qualified for Las Vegas through a lucky loser handout. Guccione then qualified for the American double Tennis Masters Series, Indian Wells and Miami but was unable to get past the first round in both tournaments.\n\nAt the 2007 Wimbledon Championships, Guccione's first round match was against Great Britain's Alex Bogdanovic. Guccione won in straight sets 7–6, 6–4, 6–4. Chris Guccione's 2nd round match was against the 6th seed Russian Nikolay Davydenko. Guccione squandered a 2 sets to 0 lead, losing the match in 5 sets.\n\nPrior to the AO Series 2008, John Newcombe lashed out at Guccione for his lack of match fitness, saying that \"with his height and his serve, he could be fucking lethal out there\"\", and for not realising his considerable potential: \"he should be top-30 in the world and trouble anyone if he was properly fit.\"\n\nGuccione's 2008 AO campaign commenced at the 2008 Next Generation Adelaide International with a 7–5, 7–6 win over Wayne Odesnik. However, Guccione was unable to defend his 2007 runner-up points at the Next Generation Adelaide International, succumbing to second seed Paul-Henri Mathieu 6–4, 3–6, 4–6 in the second round.\n\nGuccione responded with a run at the Medibank International in Sydney. Guccione won his first match against qualifier world number 138 Alberto Martín 7–6, 6–4. Despite Lleyton Hewitt's fantastic record against compatriot Australians, Guccione knocked him out 7–6, 7–6 in the second round. Showing signs of the form from the 2007 Next Generation Adelaide International, Guccione scalped world number 14 Tomáš Berdych 4–6, 7–6, 6–4 and world number 32 Radek Štěpánek storming his way to the final against Dmitry Tursunov. However, his dream run came to a halt as he was edged out 6–7, 6–7. Guccione was unable to replicate his form at the 2008 Australian Open, losing to Hyung-Taik Lee in straight sets 7–6, 6–3, 6–4.\n\nThe American Tennis Tournament Series kick started at the Regions Morgan Keegan Championships, Memphis, and Guccione made an impressive showing by defeating world number 117 Robert Kendrick 7–6, 7–6 and world number 54 Thomas Johansson 6–3, 6–4. The Sydney rematch against world number 34 Radek Štěpánek in the quarter finals went in favor of Stepanek 6–7, 1–6.\n\nGuccione failed to qualify for the Indian Wells Masters tournament. However, in the Sunrise challenger, a warm-up tournament for the Miami Masters, Guccione recorded his best ever win against world number 12 Fernando González 5–7, 6–4, 6–4 in the semifinals. However, he was unable to continue his form as he failed to qualify for the Miami Masters. Despite this, Guccione rose to his highest career singles ranking of 67 on 7 April.\n\nFollowing Guccione's U.S stint, he returned to Australia for the Oceania qualifying Davis Cup tie against Thailand. Guccione opened the tie against Thai number 1 Dani Udomchoke and was taken to 5 sets before winning 6–7, 7–6, 4–6, 7–6, 7–5.\n\nHowever Guccione was unable to carry on the momentum he had created over the past couple of months, losing in the first round of 7 of his next 8 tournament appearances including first round losses at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. Guccione finished the year ranked 96.\n\nGuccione's 2009 season started in poor fashion, losing to American Amer Delic in the first round of qualifying at the inaugural Brisbane International. Guccione had been upset prior to the commencement of the tournament after he had been shunned of a main draw wildcard in favor of younger players Bernard Tomic and Brydan Klein. After his match Guccione was too distraught to talk to the media.\n\nHowever the following week at the 2009 Sydney International, Guccione bounced back with an impressive 6–3, 6–4 win over 6th seed Tomáš Berdych before going on to lose in the following round to eventual finalist Jarkko Nieminen, 7–6, 6–3.\n\nDespite falling out of the top 100 after his loss in Sydney, Guccione went on to win his first match at the Australian Open since he made his debut in 2004, defeating Nicolas Devilder of France 6–4, 6–2, 6–4 before losing in four sets to 7th seed Gilles Simon in the second round.\n\nGuccione teamed up with Lleyton Hewitt in March 2009 to play Thailand in the 2nd round of the Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Zone. After Hewitt lost to Danai Udomchoke in the 4th rubber, it was left to Guccione to defeat Kittiphong Wachiramanowong in the deciding match. He won 6–3, 7–5, 7–6, sending Australia into a 3rd round clash against India in May.\n\nGuccione and George Bastl beat Andy Ram and Jonathan Erlich in doubles 7–5, 7–6, to win the final of the Israel Ramat Hasharon Challenger tournament in May 2009. He had reached the third round of the Cincinnati masters, defeating Philipp Kohlschreiber in the first round and world number 7 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the second. Guccione lost to Tomáš Berdych in the third round 4–6, 3–6, and then suffered an Achilles injury on the foot while playing doubles at Washington which affected his preparations before the US Open, where he lost in the first round to Pablo Cuevas. The injury caused him to miss part of the 2010 season. \n\nAfter recovering from the Achilles injury that had Guccione sidelined for over 6 months, he had finally made his comeback appearance at the Wimbledon tune-up event; the 2010 Aegon Championships. He faced Dudi Sela in the opening round and lost in three tight sets.\n\nGuccione played a number of ATP Challenger Tour events in order to further recover from his Achilles injury and gain match fitness, in addition to entering both singles and doubles qualifying draws at majors. In doubles, he often paired with fellow Australian Carsten Ball and the pair won back-to-back titles in the Sacramento and Tiburon $100,000 Challenger events in October, in the latter tournament defeating a strong team of Sam Querrey and Steve Johnson 6–1, 5–7, [10–6]. \n\nGuccione made a return to tennis at the inaugural ATP Cup with a double win with John Peers.\n\n\"Current through the 2020 Australian Open.\"\n"}

He took the human form as Narayana Pantaram at Tharuvaiyur near seashore to destroy the evil spirit of Kali and transform the Kaliyukam into Dharma Yukam. \n\nThis is the only Ayyavazhi festival which is celebrated simultaneously in all worship centres of Ayyavazhi on 19th Masi, the day before the date of incarnation of Vaikundar. The Vaikunda Jayanthi festival is a restricted holiday for the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. It is also a local holiday for the districts of Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Tuticorin districts. The Great Masi Procession from Nagercoil to Swamithope on the Avatar day is one among the largest religious processions in Tamil Nadu.\n\nA grand procession originates from Thiruchendur to Nagercoil on the 19th of Masi representing the way of Vaikundar after the Avataram to Detchanam, and another procession starts from Thiruvananthapuram to Nagercoil, on the same date representing the release of Lord Vaikundar from the jail of Singarathoppe. Both meet at Nagercoil in the evening and at the next early morning, on the 20th of Masi the Vaikunda Jayanthi Orvalam originates from Nagercoil to Swamithoppe with several devotees. This is one of the largest festivals of the district which attracts a large crowd.\n\nAs per the scriptures of Ayyavazhi the incarnation of Vaikundar was from the Sea of Tiruchendur on 20th of Masi. So on celebrating this event the nationwide followers of Ayyavazhi assemble at Tiruchendur on that day (19th Masi or 3 March) at Avatharappathi, the Pathi erected on the sea-shore where Vaikundar is believed to be incarnated.\n\nOn 18th Masi, (previous day) night the festival at Tiruchendur is celebrated in a grand scale and several conferences, cultural programs and Anna Dharmams were held and the celebration goes on for the full night. Then on the 19th Masi morning, around 8 O' clock the people assembled there will take a holy bath in the Sea of Thiruchendur under the leadership of Avathara pathi Dharmaghartta's. This practise of taking bath (holy dip) at Thiruchendur on the day of Vaikunda Avatar is considered sacred. The Dharmaghartta's applies sacred 'Namam' on everybody's forehead. Then around 9 O' clock the procession starts from Tiruchendur under the leadership of Dharmaghartta's. The people follows Dharmaghartta's chanting \"\"Ayya Siva-siva Siva-siva ara-kara ara-kara\"\". Several vehicles such as trucks, vans and cars follow the procession.\n\nThe procession goes through Seerkatchi, Nainarpathu, Udangudi, Chettiarpuram, Theriyoor, Santhayadi, Kottankadu, Muthukrishnapuram, Padukkapathu, Thattarmadam, Thisayanvilai and reaches Erumaikulam at noon. Here the people participate in Anna Dharmam. Then, the procession starts from here and travels through Ayankulam, Karaichuthupudur, Koodankulam, Chettikulam, Chalaipudur, Avaraikulam, Ambalavanapuram, Aralvaimozhi, Thovalai and reaches Athalavilai.\n\nLord Vaikundar, was released from the Jail of Singarathoppe on 19th Masi, (3 March) after the trial with the king of Travancore, Swathi Thirunal. After the release Lord was carried in a Vahana to Swamithoppe, by his followers. So on celebrating this event the people used to go to Thiruvananthapuram on that day and go as a procession to Swamithoppe.\n\nThough religiously, this celebration is not associated with the incarnation of Vaikundar, since it coincides with that day it too is commonly seen as an incarnational fest and is celebrated in the same vein. Though this was an on-foot procession for some years, now it was changed as a vehicle procession. Most of the people who participate in this procession are from Kerala. Like wise the Tiruchendur procession.\n\nThe procession starts from East Fort to Nagercoil through the Thiruvananthapuram - Kanyakumari Highway (NH - 47). It passes through the towns of Balaramapuram, Parasala, Kaliyakkavilai, Marthandam, and Thuckalay and finally reaches Athalavilai around 6.30 pm.\n\nBoth the Thiruchendur and Thiruvananthapuram processions unifies at Athalavilai. The\" 'Vaikunda Jyothi' \" is lighted on the top of a hillock Vaikunda Malai at Athalavilai. Then the procession proceeds to Nagercoil. A religious conference is held there in Nagercoil. Eminent persons participate in the conference. It is followed by cultural and religious programs etc. Ayyavazhi devotees from all over the nation stays here over the night.\n\nOn the next day on 20th of Masi, (4 March) 'The Great Masi Procession' begins early in the morning from Nagercoil. The Dharmaghartta's usually will lead the procession. A decorated vahana is carried in front of the procession in which the Akilathirattu Ammanai (palm-leaf version) is sacredly placed. This is an on-foot procession and people walk following the vahana, chanting Ayya \" 'Siva-siva Siva-siva Ara-kara Ara-kara' \". The participants will hold a saffron flag on their hands. Decorated Elephants and horses participate in this procession.\n\nThe procession goes through Edalakudi, Suchindrum, Vazukamparai, Ethankadu, North Thamaraikulam. As a sign of religious harmony, people of different faiths, Christians at Kottar; Muslims at Edalakkudi; and Hindus at Suchindram; welcome the procession by offering churul or garlands on the way. The procession reaches Swamithoppe at 12 noon and goes to the Muthirikkinaru first and then through the four car streets (Ratha veethi) of Swamithope pathi. Then it goes around the Santhana veethi, the inner-circumambulating route of pathi (shown in the blue print above). Before entering the Pathi the people hand over the flags at the pathi. \nLakhs of Ayyavazhi followers participate in this procession, and thousands of Vehicles follows. So the transport on Nagercoil-Kanyakumari Highway will be closed on that day till noon. This is one of the largest festivals of the state which attracts a huge crowd beyond the state.\n\nThis day was announced as a holiday by the government of Tamil Nadu for the districts of Kanyakumari from 1993 and for Tirunelveli and Tuticorin from the year 2006.\n\nAlso, several other Pathis too conduct processions on that day. Apart from these, the festival is also celebrated all over Tamil Nadu and Kerala grandly with processions in some Thangals including in Chennai in which thousands participate.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2127636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127636", "title": "Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment", "text": "Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment\n\nMaple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd. (MLSE) is a professional sports and commercial real estate company based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. With assets that include franchises in four of the six major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, it is the largest sports and entertainment company in Canada, and one of the largest in North America.\n\nThe primary holdings of the company are its major sports franchises, the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League, Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association, Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, and Toronto FC of Major League Soccer, as well as their minor league farm teams, the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League (AHL), Raptors 905 of the NBA G League and Toronto FC II of the USL League One, respectively.\n\nIn addition, it owns Scotiabank Arena (originally named Air Canada Centre), the home arena of the Maple Leafs and Raptors, and the OVO Athletic Centre (originally named BioSteel Centre), the practice facility for the Raptors. MLSE also manages or has invested in several other sports facilities including BMO Field, home of Toronto FC and the Toronto Argonauts; Coca-Cola Coliseum, home of the Marlies; Ford Performance Centre, the practice facility of the Maple Leafs and Marlies; BMO Training Ground practice facility for Toronto FC and home of Toronto FC II and the TFC Academy; and Lamport Stadium, practice facility for the Argonauts.\n\nMLSE was founded by Conn Smythe in 1931 as Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL) to act as a holding company for the Maple Leafs and their planned new arena Maple Leaf Gardens, from which the company got its name. Smythe transferred his ownership of the Leafs to the company in exchange for shares in MLGL and sold shares in the holding company to the public to help fund construction of the arena. While initially primarily a hockey company, with ownership stakes in a number of minor and junior hockey clubs including the Toronto Marlboros of the Ontario Hockey Association, the company later branched out to own the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL from the late 1970s to late 1980s, before merging with the Raptors, who were constructing the Air Canada Centre at the time, and adopting their current name in 1998. The company launched Toronto FC in 2007. Most recently, the company completed its purchase of the Argonauts in January 2018.\n\nOver most of its 80 plus years of existence MLSE was a public company. Following the death of majority owner Harold Ballard in 1990, Steve Stavro led a controversial bid to buy the company and take it private. In 2012, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan sold their 79.53% share of the company for billion to a joint venture between Rogers Communications and BCE Inc., two of Canada's largest media companies, giving the company an equity value of billion and an enterprise value of billion.\n\nThe corporation's roots can be traced back to 1927, when Conn Smythe organized a group of investors to purchase Toronto's premier hockey franchise, the Toronto St. Patricks of the National Hockey League (NHL), which had won Stanley Cup championships in 1918 (as the Toronto Arenas) and 1922, from a group headed by Charles Querrie. The club was playing poorly and minority partner Jack Bickell contacted Smythe about becoming coach of the team. However, Smythe told Bickell that he was more interested in buying a stake in the team. Not long after, with the team in trouble financially due to majority owner Querrie having lost a lawsuit to former Toronto Blueshirts owner Eddie Livingstone over ownership of the franchise, Querrie put the St. Pats up for sale and agreed in principle to sell them to C. C. Pyle for $200,000, who planned to move the team to Philadelphia. After Bickell contacted Smythe to inform him of the sale, Smythe persuaded Querrie that civic pride was more important than money and put together a syndicate that bought the St. Pats. Smythe himself invested $10,000 of his own money and his group contributed $75,000 up front and a further $75,000 due 30 days later, with Bickell retaining his $40,000 share in the team. The deal was finalized on Valentine's Day, and the new owners quickly renamed the team the Toronto Maple Leafs, after the national symbol of Canada. Smythe attributed his choice of a maple Leaf for the logo to his experiences as a Canadian Army officer and prisoner of war during World War I. Later that year, Smythe bought the junior hockey Toronto Marlboros of the Ontario Hockey Association to serve as a developmental team for Maple Leafs.\n\nIn 1929 Smythe decided, in the midst of the Great Depression, that the Maple Leafs needed a new arena. The Arena Gardens, their then home which they shared with the Marlboros, had been built in 1912 and lacked modern amenities. It seated just 8,000, which the Maple Leafs were regularly filling. After considering various locations, the site at the corner of Carlton and Church was purchased from The T. Eaton Co. Ltd. for $350,000, a price said to be $150,000 below market value. A new 12,473 seat (14,550 including standing room) arena, Maple Leaf Gardens (MLG), was designed by the architectural firm of Ross and Macdonald. To finance construction, Smythe got backing from Sun Life for half of the expected $1 million cost. He then formed Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL) as a management company that would own both the hockey team and the arena. A public offering of shares in MLGL was made at $10 each ($ in dollars), with a free common share for each five preferred shares purchased. Ownership of the hockey team was transferred to MLGL in return for shares. To fund construction of the building, workers were paid 20% of their salary in MLG stock. Construction started on June 1, 1931, and MLG was opened five months and two weeks later, on November 12, 1931, at a cost of $1.5 million ($ in dollars). The Marlboros also moved to the new arena. Bickell was named the first president of MLG.\n\nTo help fill dates at the new arena, Smythe acquired an expansion franchise in the professional International Lacrosse League on behalf of MLGL for the 1932 season, which was also given the name the Toronto Maple Leafs. A team named the Toronto Maple Leafs had competed in the first season of the ILL at the Arena Gardens, but was renamed the Tecumsehs with the arrival of Smythe's team. Both teams played at MLG. Smythe pulled out following the season due to financial losses, and the league did not play the following year.\n\nThe company has owned numerous minor league hockey teams over the years, which have served as developmental farm teams for the Maple Leafs. A group backed by Smythe and Frank Selke of the Montreal Canadiens was awarded an American Hockey League (AHL) franchise for Rochester, New York in July 1956, after a local group could not come up with the US$150,000 in capital required by the league. The Leafs and Canadiens would each own 27.5% of the team, with the balance sold to Rochester interests. The team was named the Rochester Americans. The Amerks were a joint affiliate of both the Canadiens and the Maple Leafs, though the club was operated by the Canadiens. In the summer of 1959 the Maple Leafs bought out the Canadiens' ownership share of the club, giving them a 55% controlling interest, due to concerns that with Montreal operating the club they were giving their prospects priority over those of the Leafs. They purchased most of the remaining 45% in 1963, boosting their ownership share to 98% by November 1964. In July 1966 the Maple Leafs sold the team to a group which included their then General Manager Punch Imlach for a reported $400,000.\n\nIn June 1963 the Spokane Comets Western Hockey League franchise was purchased by a group led by the Maple Leafs, who relocated them to become the Denver Invaders and act as the Leaf's farm team. Though the league did not acknowledge that the Maple Leafs had an ownership stake in the team, they held a majority position with the Denver partners only owning roughly 36%. Following reported losses of $150,000 in their first season, Smythe announced that the team would be relocated after the team failed to reach a 2,000 season ticket target by a league-imposed deadline. The team became the Victoria Maple Leafs for the following season. In June 1967 MLGL sold the team for $500,000 to a group from Phoenix, which relocated it to become the Phoenix Roadrunners.\n\nIn 1964 MLGL the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Professional Hockey League were launched. The team was owned and operated by MLGL as a developmental club for the Maple Leafs. In the spring of 1973 it was announced that the Oilers would relocate to become the Oklahoma City Blazers. Prior to the 1976–77 season the Maple Leafs decided to share an affiliate with the Chicago Black Hawks in an attempt to reduce costs, and pulled out of the Blazers. In 1978 the New Brunswick Hawks of the AHL were established, and were jointly operated by the Chicago Black Hawks and the Toronto Maple Leafs as their farm team. MLGL and the Black Hawks each owned half of the franchise. However, by 1980 MLGL had decided that the Leafs needed a team of their own, with a spokesperson citing the limited number of roster spots as the rationale for the move. In 1981 the Cincinnati Tigers of the old Central Hockey League were established under the ownership of MLGL, but the team averaged only 1,500 fans and lost $750,000 in their first season and folded the following spring. Shortly thereafter, with Chicago having pulled out of New Brunswick in favour of affiliating with the Springfield Indians on their own, the Leafs relocated the New Brunswick Hawks to St. Catharines, Ontario to establish the St. Catharines Saints as their farm team. The team played in St. Catharines until 1986, and after stops in Newmarket, Ontario as the Newmarket Saints (1986–1991) and St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador as the St. John's Maple Leafs (1991–2005), the team moved to Toronto as the Toronto Marlies (named after the company's former junior team) where they have been playing ever since.\n\nThe Toronto Marlboros served as a junior farm team for the Maple Leafs for 40 years until direct NHL sponsorship of junior clubs ended in 1967 when the NHL made the Entry Draft universal. In October 1988, with the team losing hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, MLGL reached an agreement to sell the Marlboros for a reported $500,000, severing their ties with the Maple Leafs. However, the Leafs retained the rights to the Marlies name. The OHL team moved to Hamilton for the 1989–90 season, becoming the Dukes of Hamilton.\n\nIn 1967 MLGL entered into negotiations to purchase the financially struggling Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team of the minor AAA International League. The asking price was $60,000. The deal ultimately fell apart due to concerns about the team's stadium, Maple Leaf Stadium, which needed up to $250,000 in repairs and whose owner wanted $4 million to purchase it, and the team was sold and relocated to become the Louisville Colonels for the following season. MLGL owner Harold Ballard said that the company's interest was due in part to help position itself to go after a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise for Toronto. In early 1974 MLGL announced plans to build a new baseball stadium in Toronto, but the city ultimately decided to renovate Exhibition Stadium to make it suitable for baseball. At the time, the MLGL group, led by Lorne Duguid, vice-president of Hiram Walker Distillers and MLGL executive, was one of at least four bidding for a Toronto MLB team, including competing groups led by Labatt Brewing Company, Robert Hunter, the former President of the International League Maple Leafs, and Canadian Baseball Co, led by Sydney Cooper. After negotiating with the owners of the Baltimore Orioles, Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians and Oakland Athletics in their attempt to acquire a team for Toronto, MLGL offered $15 million for the San Francisco Giants but the team's owner decided in early 1976 to sell the club to the Labatt group for US$13.25 million. While the Giants' relocation was ultimately rejected by a U.S. court, Labatt was awarded an expansion team in the American League that became the Toronto Blue Jays for US$7 million later that year.\n\nA team named the Toronto Maple Leafs competed in the inaugural season of the National Lacrosse Association, a professional box lacrosse league, in 1968 at MLG. MLGL owners Ballard and Stafford Smythe were two of the five founding partners of the club, but financial difficulties forced MLGL to take over ownership midway through the season. The NLA suspended operations prior to the following season.\n\nIn the early 1970s MLGL announced plans to apply for a second Toronto-based Canadian Football League team, in addition to the Toronto Argonauts, which would play at Varsity Stadium, but the proposal never went anywhere. In 1974, when his former partner John Bassett put the Argonauts up for sale for $3.3 million, Ballard expressed interest in buying the team, but it was ultimately sold to William R. Hodgson. Shortly thereafter Ballard tried to buy the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL from owner Michael DeGroote, but this offer was also rejected. Three money-losing seasons later, in February 1978, DeGroote sold the team to MLGL for $1.3 million. During his tenure as owner of the Tiger-Cats, Ballard repeatedly threatened to move the franchise to Toronto's Varsity Stadium, which was vetoed by the Argos, and claimed to have lost roughly $20 million over 11 seasons. MLGL sold the team in March 1989 to David Braley for $2.\n\nRuby Richman, the former coach of Canada men's national basketball team, working with Ballard pursued a number of existing National Basketball Association (NBA) and American Basketball Association (ABA) teams to relocate to Toronto to play at MLG in the 1970s. Richman had a tentative agreement to purchase both the Miami Floridians and Pittsburgh Condors of the ABA with a plan to merge them into a single Toronto-based team, but the deal fell through. Later, Richman held negotiations with the Detroit Pistons, which were seeking $5 million for the franchise, but pulled out when the price was raised to $8.25 million. MLGL attempted to purchase and relocate the Buffalo Braves, which had played a number of regular season games at MLG over the years, to Toronto in 1974 for $8.5 million, and again several times later, but the owners eventually chose to move the team to San Diego. When Toronto was awarded an expansion NBA franchise in 1974 for the 1975–76 season MLGL was one of three groups to bid for the rights to the team, but the club never materialized as no group was able to secure funding for the expansion fee of $6.8 million. MLGL attempted to purchase and relocate the Houston Rockets in 1975, which were seeking $8 million for the team, but the team's lease ultimately prevented a relocation. In 1976 MLGL attempted to buy the Atlanta Hawks. In 1979 a Toronto group which included Ballard again pushed for an expansion franchise, but lost out to the Dallas Mavericks. A Toronto group, which included Bill Ballard, son of Harold, and Basketball Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain submitted an application and US$100,000 deposit for an NBA expansion franchise for MLG in 1986, but of the six cities to apply Toronto was not one of the four which were successful. It was not until the NBA awarded an expansion franchise to John Bitove, over a group led by future MLSE minority partner Larry Tanenbaum which had partnered with the Maple Leafs, and the Toronto Raptors joined the NBA for the 1995–96 season that the city would get an NBA team.\n\nIn 1997 it was reported that the Maple Leafs were in negotiations to purchase the Toronto Shooting Stars of the National Professional Soccer League. The team had been suspended following their inaugural season playing at MLG during which the club lost nearly $1 million and the league was forced to take over operations after only three games when ownership pulled out. However, the team never returned to play. Following the inaugural season of the Hamilton, Ontario-based Ontario Raiders of the National Lacrosse League in 1998, in which they lost $250,000 playing at Copps Coliseum, owner Chris Fritz was forced to look for partners. MLSE engaged in negotiations to purchase the team and have it play at MLG. However, a group which included Bill Watters, the then Assistant General Manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs, ultimately bought the team for $250,000 and promptly moved it to MLG where they rebranded the team the Toronto Rock. MLSE held negotiations with the Arena Football League in 1998 on acquiring a US$4–7 million expansion franchise for the following season to coincide with the opening of the ACC. The company also submitted an application for a Women's National Basketball Association franchise, but was rejected by the league due to concerns about their readiness.\n\nWith MLG aging, MLGL began planning for a new home arena for the Maple Leafs in the 1990s. At the time, the Raptors were constructing a new arena, later to be called Scotiabank Arena, which they invited the Maples Leafs to be a joint tenant at. However, MLGL reject the offer, arguing that \"the footprint is too small\". When Allan Slaight took over controlling ownership of the Toronto Raptors in late 1996, talks began again between the two groups. MLGL put forward a proposal to the city to construct a new $300 million shared arena just to the north, on top of the rail tracks Union Station, with the already under construction Raptors arena being converted to a bus terminal. However, the proposal died when an agreement could not reached with the City of Toronto government on rent for the land. In November 1997 MLSE submitted a new proposal for a $250 million arena at Exhibition Place. However, after years of acrimonious negotiations MLGL purchased 100% of the Raptors basketball club and the ACC, from Allan Slaight and the Bank of Nova Scotia on February 12, 1998. MLGL paid a reported $467 million, made up of $179 million for the team and $288 million for the arena. Richard Peddie, who had been President of the Toronto Raptors, was retained in the merger and became MLSE's President and CEO. That July the company adopted a new name, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE), to reflect its broader holdings. MLSE subsequently ordered major modifications to the original design of the ACC, which was basketball-specific, to make it more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217 million, the budget was increased to $265 million after MLSE took control. In February 1999 the company opened the ACC as the new home to the Leafs and Raptors. MLG, which was left with no major tenants, was sold in 2004 for $12 million to Loblaw Companies, Canada's largest food retailer, which converted the ground level into one of its Loblaws franchises. A condition of the sale was that it was not to be used as a sports and entertainment facility, though MLSE eventually consented to allowing a small arena to be restored in the building to house Ryerson University's Rams.\n\nThe Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) granted MLSE two category 2 digital specialty channel licenses in 2000 for Leafs TV and Raptors NBA TV, which launched on September 7, 2001. The channels were used by MLSE to broadcast live games involving their teams in an attempt to increase competition for their rights and drive up the fees paid by other broadcasters.\n\nIn August 2004 MLSE announced that they would relocate their AHL farm team from St. John's, Newfoundland to Toronto to play in Ricoh Coliseum (later renamed Coca-Cola Coliseum) for the 2005–06 season, after the arena was left without a hockey tenant following the termination of their lease with the Toronto Roadrunners, the AHL affiliate of the Edmonton Oilers, for defaulting on their rent. MLSE agreed to a 20-year lease for the Coliseum, which had undergone a $38 million renovation in 2003, that called for rent to cover debt financing charges, property taxes and generate a return to the arena investors, which exceeds $4 million annually.\n\nMLSE announced in April 2005 that they would be working with Cadillac Fairview (a wholly owned subsidiary of Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan) and Lanterra Developments to build Maple Leaf Square, a major entertainment complex situated next to the ACC. The $500 million complex, which was completed in 2010, is a mixed use facility which features the Hotel St. Germain, e11ven restaurant, Real Sports Apparel, Real Sports Bar and Grill, Longo's grocery store, office space and condominium residences. In conjunction with the construction of Maple Leaf Square was a two-year, $48 million renovation of the ACC to connect it with the square, which added a new atrium that includes a high-definition broadcast studio for Leafs TV, NBA TV Canada and GolTV Canada. The external wall of the atrium features a 30 by video screen which often broadcasts games to spectators gathered in the plaza in front of the arena.\n\nMLSE was awarded a Major League Soccer expansion team for Toronto, which would become known as Toronto FC, in 2005 for US$10 million. The company also agreed to contribute $8 million towards the construction of Toronto FC's future home BMO Field, which was to cost $62.9 million total, and purchased the naming rights to the stadium for $10 million for 20 years, which they subsequently resold to the Bank of Montreal for $27 million over the first 10 years. MLSE also agreed to cover any construction cost overruns. The governments of Canada, Ontario and Toronto contributed $27 million, $8 million and $9.8 million respectively, with the City of Toronto also providing the land. In return, MLSE got the management rights for the stadium for 20 years. Prior to the 2010 MLS season, MLSE spent $3.5 million to convert the stadium from FieldTurf to natural grass, and a further $2 million to expand the north end by 1,400 seats. As part of the deal to convert the field to natural grass, MLSE spent $1.2 million adding a winter bubble to Lamport Stadium and $800,000 building a new artificial turf field to replace the community use hours lost at BMO Field. The company manages the operations of the facility during the winter season, when the field is covered by the dome and community soccer programs are held.\n\nMLSE partnered with Rogers Communications in 2005 to bid to host a regular season National Football League game in Toronto. On January 30, 2008 it was announced that Rogers and Larry Tanenbaum, chairman of MLSE, had reached an agreement with the Buffalo Bills to host an annual regular-season and three exhibition NFL games over five seasons at Toronto's Rogers Centre beginning in 2008, with the games branded the Bills Toronto Series. At the time MLSE was considering bringing an NFL team to Toronto permanently and building them a new stadium, but abandoned the idea when they concluded that the project would not generate sufficient financial return to justify the significant cost of the project. Subsequently, MLSE president Tim Leiweke said on an NFL team in Toronto: \"We can't own a team (per NFL rules), but we do have more expertise on how to build (stadiums) than anyone ... MLSE can play a role.\" It has been reported that MLSE is interested in building and managing the proposed NFL stadium, which it has already begun designing. In 2013 MLSE minority owner Tanenbaum and board member Edward Rogers III partnered with musician Jon Bon Jovi to purchase an NFL team. Following the death of Bills' owner Ralph Wilson in 2014 the group submitted an offer to purchase the franchise, with speculation that they would move the team to Toronto when their lease permitted it, but were outbid by the Pegulas.\n\nBefore MLSE completed its purchase of the Argonauts of the CFL in early 2018, the company contemplated purchasing the team at least twice, with minority partner Tanenbaum keen to add the team to his list of franchises, but concluded that the cost and effort that would be required to make the team profitable was not worth the minimal financial upside. In 2013, it was reported that the company was again considering purchasing the team and having them play at a renovated BMO Field, with the asking price reportedly $20 million, but later coming down to $10 million. A vote by MLSE's board on purchasing the team was called in December 2013, but they were unable to come to an agreement on the issue. On May 20, 2015 it was announced that two of the three ownership partners of MLSE, Bell Canada and Tanenbaum's Kilmer Group, had acquired ownership of the Argos, with the deal to close at the end of the year, and would move the team to BMO Field for the 2016 season. It has been speculated that Rogers was not interested in investing in the team since Bell has exclusive rights to broadcast all CFL games. MLSE eventually completed its purchase the Argos in January 2018. According to the \"National Post\", the sale, which came less than a month after the team won the 2017 Grey Cup, \"is expected to help the Argos, given MLSE’s financial scale and promotional, ticketing and operational advantages.\" Additionally, it is thought that control of the Argos by MLSE will enhance Toronto's chances of acquiring an NFL franchise, with Peddie saying \"the NFL is telling them that if you want an NFL team, you better make sure the Argos are okay.\" Leiweke has said that moving into a renovated BMO field \"will help turn [the Argos] around\" and that \"there's no way the NFL comes here without the CFL being unbelievably successful first.\" Upon completion of the sale, MLSE now owns four of the five major league sports teams in Toronto (only the Blue Jays are not owned by MLSE, although Rogers Communications, which owns the Blue Jays, has an ownership stake in MLSE).\n\nWhen the nearby city of Oshawa built a new arena, known as General Motors Centre, MLSE was chosen to manage the building. However, disappointing results in the first year and a half of operations following the arena's opening in November 2006 led MLSE to request that its contract be terminated in March 2008. The company had been attempting to get into the business of managing facilities beyond those where their teams play but decided to withdraw, with Bob Hunter, MLSE's Vice President of venues and entertainment, saying that managing the arena was \"no longer a strategic focus for us\".\n\nIn 2008 MLSE launched the TFC Academy youth system to develop soccer players for Toronto FC by taking advantage of MLS's new homegrown player rule which allows clubs to retain the rights to players they develop without them being subject to the MLS SuperDraft. The senior academy team originally competed in the Canadian Soccer League until pulling out in early 2013 due to the CSL losing its sanctioning from the Canadian Soccer Association. The team played that year in the Ontario Soccer League before joining League1 Ontario for the 2014 season. In November 2014 MLSE announced the establishment of Toronto FC II, their own minor league professional soccer team playing in the United Soccer League (now known as the USL Championship) and serving as a reserve team for TFC and a bridge between the Academy. The team began play in 2015 at a newly renovated 2,000 seat stadium, with plans to expand it to 5,000 by 2017, constructed at the Ontario Soccer Centre in Vaughan, just north of Toronto. However, after the expansion did not materialize, which was required to meet the 5,000 seat minimum requirement set by the United States Soccer Federation for the USL to be sanctioned as a division 2 league, the club announced that it would move its home games to BMO Field and Lamport Stadium beginning with the 2018 season. On July 2, 2018 the club announced they would move to USL League One for the league's first season in 2019.\n\nIn March 2011 Downsview Park was selected as the site of Toronto FC's new state-of-the-art academy and training facility. Construction began on the BMO Training Ground in May 2011, and the facility opened in June 2012. It includes three grass fields, one domed turf field and a field house. MLSE spent more than $21 million building the facility and pays rent for the land, In July 2014 it was announced that MLSE would expand the training grounds to house a practice facility for the Argos, which would rent the facility from MLSE and practice on a nearby city owned field. The team moved in that September, but later moved their practice facility to Lamport Stadium in 2018.\n\nThen Raptors President and General Manager Bryan Colangelo said in 2008 that MLSE was considering launching an NBA Development League franchise in the Toronto area within a couple of years to serve as a developmental team for the Raptors. Hamilton's Copps Coliseum and Oshawa were reportedly under consideration to host the franchise. However, a Canadian-based franchise posed difficulties due to tax and visa complications, and Rochester, New York, which is just across the United States border, was considered as an alternative. In May 2015 it was announced that MLSE had purchased a D-League franchise, which would be named Raptors 905 and would begin play that fall at the Hershey Centre in Mississauga, a suburb of Toronto. The franchise reportedly cost $6 million.\n\nIt was announced on January 23, 2009 that MLSE would acquire the 80.1% interest in GolTV Canada, a digital cable soccer channel, held by MLSE owner Tanenbaum through Insight Sports. The channel operated as a localized version of GOL TV USA, which owned the remaining 19.9%, with focus on Toronto FC. MLSE informed the CRTC in 2015 that it had acquired full ownership of the channel, however later that year they announced that it would cease operations and the license be abandoned, effective August 31, 2015. In November 2009 MLSE applied to the CRTC for a Category 2 digital TV license for a general interest sports service provisionally named Mainstream Sports, which was granted in June 2010. MLSE planned to broadcast its teams' games on the channel, along the lines of team-owned regional sports networks in the United States such as YES Network and the New England Sports Network, with the tentative name \"Real Sports\" (in keeping with the branding of MLSE's sports bar and apparel store). It was never revealed whether the channel would have replaced, or supplemented, MLSE's existing digital channels. Peddie credited the threat of a Real Sports channel as a motivator for Rogers and Bell, owners of sports channels Sportsnet and TSN respectively, to purchase the company due to concerns about losing the rights to broadcast MLSE teams to the channel or having to pay huge fees for them. The acquisition of MLSE by Rogers and Bell in 2012, and associated agreements to divide the company's regional broadcast rights between the two, eliminated the need for the channel and its license expired after the three-year deadline for launch passed in 2013.\n\nIn September 2009 the Maple Leafs and Marlies opened their new hockey practice facility, the MasterCard Centre (later renamed the Ford Performance Centre). The arena was a joint venture between MLSE, the City of Toronto and the Lakeshore Lions Club to replace the nearby Lakeshore Lions Arena, and was built at a cost of $44 million, after cost overruns drove up the cost from $33.65 million. The Lions Club contributed $40 million to the project, with the city providing a $35.5 million loan guarantee. The Toronto District School Board leased the land for the arena to the Lakeshore Lions for a 50-year term. MLSE spent a further $5 million on training and medical facilities, and pays $600,000 annually to rent the building. The arena was originally operated by the Lakeshore Lions Club, but in June 2011, with the arena on the verge of defaulting on its rising debt, the City of Toronto took control and assumed its $43.4 million debt with the intention to return it to private management within 2–3 years. A city councillor has suggested that MLSE, which operates BMO Field and Coca-Cola Coliseum on behalf of the city, would be \"the logical party\" to take over the arena, and a spokesperson for the company said \"while we don't have any interest in purchasing the facility, we are open to discussing the possibility of managing the facility on behalf of the City\". MLSE's executive vice president of venues and entertainment Bob Hunter confirmed that they would bid for the right to run the building.\n\nAt one point MLSE contemplated purchasing the Toronto Blue Jays of MLB and Sportsnet from Rogers Communications, but concerns about the viability of Rogers Centre as a baseball venue and the profitability of the team resulted in the company not pursuing either. The company also considered investing in an English soccer club, and in May 2012, after the Leeds United Supporters Trust put out a request for a takeover from majority shareholder Ken Bates, it was reported that MLSE were in talks to buy the Football League Championship team. However, the company later denied that it planned to purchase the club. In 2015 reports emerged that MLSE was investigating taking over the bankrupt Parma F.C. of Italy's Serie A.\n\nPeddie retired as President and CEO of MLSE at the end of 2011 after 14 years on the job, having tripled the value of the company. However, he was often criticized for his inability to end the company's long championship drought. The Leafs haven't won a championship since 1967, and at the time the only other major championship won under MLSE ownership was the 74th Grey Cup in 1986 by the Tiger-Cats. Toronto FC subsequently won in 2017, as did the Raptors in 2019. (The Argonauts' 2017 Grey Cup win came shortly before MLSE announced its purchase of the team.) Though Tom Anselmi briefly took over as President, he was replaced in June 2013 by high-profile executive Tim Leiweke, who had previously run Anschutz Entertainment Group. On August 21, 2014 Leiweke announced that he was stepping down, but would remain in his position until a successor was appointed. MLSE announced on October 29, 2015 that Michael Friisdahl had been hired as Leiweke's successor as President and CEO, and would officially assume his duties in December 2015.\nThe financial success of Toronto FC led MLSE to undertake a major renovation of BMO Field. Under a two phase process, the stadium's capacity was increased from 21,566 to 30,000 by May 2015, and a canopy roof covering most permanent seating areas was added and the pitch lengthened to accommodate a Canadian football field by May 2016. The renovations were originally budgeted to cost $120 million, but ended up at $150 million in total. In exchange for a $10 million contribution to the project by the City of Toronto, which owns the stadium, they receive rent from MLSE, while MLSE's management and naming rights agreements for the stadium, which were set to expire in 2027, were extended by 10 years. The province of Ontario also contributed $10 million to the financing. The City insisted that the renovations allow the Argonauts, who had to vacate their current home the Rogers Centre, to move in. The sale of the Argos in May 2015 to a new ownership group consisting of MLSE owners Bell and Tanenbaum was accompanied by an announcement that they had reached an agreement with MLSE to relocate to the stadium for the 2016 season. The Argos contributed $10 million to the conversion of the field to make it CFL compatible, which was matched by MLSE. MLSE financed the rest of the project, and was responsible for cost overruns. The renovated stadium can be temporarily expanded to a capacity of roughly 40,000 for big events. The Argos purchase agreement called for two Grey Cups to played at BMO Field, the first being the 104th Grey Cup in 2016, and the stadium was chosen to host rugby sevens at the 2015 Pan-Am games and the 2017 NHL Centennial Classic.\n\nIn August 2014, MLSE reached an agreement with the City of Toronto to build a practice facility for the Raptors at Exhibition Place. MLSE paid the $30 million construction cost, and leases the property from the city for $205,000 annually, subject to reassessments for inflation, for a 20-year term, with two options to extend it by a further 10 years, following which the city would take ownership of the building. Construction was completed in time for the team's hosting of the NBA All-Star Game in February 2016. Originally known as the Biosteel Centre, in March 2019, the Raptors reached an agreement with OVO on a naming rights deal to brand the facility as the OVO Athletic Centre.\n\nIn February 2015, MLSE confirmed that they were planning on launching a professional boxing series, featuring 3-4 major fights a year co-promoted with Groupe Yvon Michel. Originally planned to start with a World Boxing Council (WBC) light heavyweight title fight in April at Ricoh Coliseum, this was delayed due to regulatory restrictions on the amount of gauze that can be used for wrist wraps in Ontario. MLSE and Michel joined with Lennox Lewis to promote a WBC light-heavyweight title fight in September 2015 at Ricoh Coliseum.\n\nIn August 2017 MLSE announced that it had reached an agreement with Scotiabank to rename the ACC Scotiabank Arena, effective July 1, 2018, for a reported CAD $800 million over 20 years, which would make it the largest such deal in North American sports history.\n\nMLSE announced in December 2017 that it had agreed to purchase the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League outright, with the deal finalized on January 19, 2018.\n\nAlthough Conn Smythe was the face of MLGL from its founding in 1931, he did not acquire majority ownership of the company until 1947, following a power struggle between directors who supported him as president and those who wanted him replaced with Frank J. Selke. With the help of a $300,000 loan from Toronto stockbroker and MLGL shareholder Percy Gardiner, and the support of minority partner Jack Bickell, Smythe was able to buy 30,000 shares in MLGL from Gardiner and installed himself as president on November 19, 1947, replacing Edward Bickle. The loan was paid off in 1960. In November 1961, Smythe sold 45,000 of his 50,000 shares to a three-person partnership formed by his son Stafford Smythe, Harold Ballard, and John Bassett (owner of the \"Toronto Telegram\" and part-owner of the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts) for $2.3 million. When combined with their own holdings, this gave the Stafford-Ballard-Bassett partnership 87,000 shares, representing 60% of the company. Ballard fronted Stafford most of the money for the purchase though a loan he obtained. According to several sources, Conn thought the sale was only to his son, and was furious when he learned that Ballard and Bassett were his partners. He had hoped that Stafford would keep MLGL for his son, Tommy. However, it is unlikely that Stafford could have raised the millions needed for the deal on his own. Stafford became president of MLGL and governor of the Maple Leafs, with Ballard becoming executive vice president and Bassett chairman of the board.\n\nIn March 1966, Conn sold his remaining MLGL shares and resigned from the board of directors after a Muhammad Ali boxing match was scheduled for MLG. He found Ali's refusal to serve in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War to be offensive, and said that by accepting the fight, MLGL owners had \"put cash ahead of class.\" Within three years under the new owners, profits had tripled to just under $1 million. Ballard negotiated lucrative deals to place advertising throughout the building, and greatly increased the number of seats in the arena.\n\nFollowing a Royal Canadian Mounted Police raid at MLG in 1968, Stafford was charged with income tax evasion, and he and Ballard were accused of illegally taking money from MLGL to pay for home renovations and other personal expenses. Just before the charges were laid, Bassett argued to the board of directors that Stafford and Ballard should be removed from their posts. On June 26, 1969, following an 8–7 vote of the board, Stafford and Ballard were both fired, and Bassett was appointed president of MLGL. However, Bassett did not force Stafford and Ballard to sell their shares, and both men remained on the board. This proved to be a serious strategic blunder; Stafford was the largest single shareholder in MLGL, and he and Ballard controlled almost half the company's stock between them. They were thus able to regain control of the board in 1970, and Stafford was once again appointed president. Facing an untenable situation, Bassett sold the 196,200 MLGL shares he controlled to Stafford and Ballard in September 1971 for $5.4 million, which he used to buy out his partners in the Argonauts. Combined with their 306,295 jointly controlled shares, the transaction gave the Stafford-Ballard partnership 78% of the stock. Stafford died in October 1971 of a bleeding ulcer at only 50 years of age, just before his trial was scheduled to begin. Under the terms of Stafford's will, of which Ballard was an executor, each partner was allowed to buy the other's shares upon their death. Stafford's brother and son tried to keep the shares within the family, but in February 1972 Ballard bought all 251,545 of Stafford's shares for $7.5 million, valuing the company at $22 million. Stafford's brother Hugh also sold his shares to Ballard, ending the Smythe family's 45-year involvement in the company. Combined with Ballard's 262,162 shares, this gave him majority ownership of about 70%. Six months later, Ballard was convicted of 47 charges, including fraud and theft of money and goods, and sentenced to three years in a federal penitentiary.\n\nIn 1966, Ballard set up a family holding company named Harold E. Ballard Ltd. (HEBL) for his assets, including his shares in MLGL, as part of an estate freeze. Ballard distributed 103 common shares in HEBL, with his three children (Bill, Harold Jr., and Mary Elizabeth) each receiving 34 which were held in trust, and his wife Dorothy receiving 1, which Harold would inherit upon her death three years later. Harold retained 308,000 preferred shares in HEBL. While the equity of the company was vested in the common stock, both common and preferred shares each received a single vote, ensuring that Harold retained control of the company.\n\nAfter getting into financial difficulty, Ballard reached an agreement in November 1980 with Molson Brewery (who at the time owned the Montreal Canadiens) for the company to cover his debt financing charges on a loan of $8.8 million for 10 years in exchange for an option to purchase a 19.9% block of shares in MLGL from HEBL and a right of first refusal on the rest of HEBL's shares. The NHL did not learn of the deal until the late 1980s. In 1982, he offered to sell the company for $50 million, with the arena alone reportedly valued at $11 million, though a stockholders' report the following year placed the value of MLGL at $23.5 million. When Harold transferred ownership of his personal real estate holdings, which were valued at $2.52 million, to HEBL in January 1989, he acquired 4 newly issued common shares in the company plus a promise of a further $896,472 rather than cash. Mary Elizabeth sold her stake in HEBL to her father for $15.5 million in January 1989, after originally having a deal to sell the stake to Don Giffin, while Harold Jr. sold his back to HEBL for $21 million in June of the same year. Harold secured a loan from Molson for the full amount of his buyout of Mary Elizabeth, using the 34 acquired shares in HEBL as security. Harold Jr.'s shares were subsequently retired. Bill sued his father for $170 million over HEBL's acquisition of Harold Jr.'s stake, claiming that he and partner Michael Cohl had acquired a right of first refusal to purchase the shares for $20 million that February. Shortly thereafter, HEBL issued Harold 32 common shares and $125,216 in exchange for ownership of his 350,200 personally held MLGL shares and $125,000. Two more new common shares would be granted to Harold to repay the $911,000 debt HEBL owed him from his two transactions with the company. This gave Harold, who feared that Bill was positioning himself to take over the holding company, control of HEBL. Harold did not want his bickering children to inherit MLGL because he feared they would destroy it.\n\nThough Ballard ran up significant amounts of personal debt during his ownership of MLGL, he made the company very profitable, so much so that MLG became known as the \"Cashbox on Carlton Street,\" referring to the address of the arena. Upon Harold's death on April 11, 1990, most of his estate, which was worth less than $50 million, was left to charitable organizations. The executors of Harold's will were supermarket tycoon Steve Stavro, Giffin, and Donald Crump. In November 1990 Molson exercised their option on 19.9% of the company, paying $10,000 for 735,575 of HEBL's MLGL shares, which at the time were valued at $20 million. Due to restrictions against cross-ownership in the NHL, the company set up a trust to hold their stake, and the league instructed them to sell the shares within an \"adequate amount of time.\" Shortly after the estate, which had limited income due to HEBL still owing Toronto-Dominion Bank $15.8 million on its loan to acquire Harold Jr's HEBL stock, missed a January 1991 deadline to repay its $20 million loan (including interest) from Molson, Stavro personally loaned the estate the funds to pay off the debt, and in exchange, he received an option to purchase the estate's HEBL shares before January 1996. Bill challenged the transaction, but it was approved by the court. In early 1991, Molson offered to buy the estate's shares for $40 each. In September 1991, Bill sold his HEBL stock to his father's estate for $21 million, giving it ownership of the entire company. Shortly thereafter it was announced that Stavro had reached a deal with Molson on an option to purchase their MLGL shares until April 1994 and for Molson to waive their option on the estate's shares.\n\nStavro founded MLG Ventures (MLGV) in March 1994 with partners Toronto—Dominion Bank and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. MLG Holdings Ltd. (MLGH), of which Stavro owned 80% and TD Bank controlled the remaining 20%, held a 51% ownership stake in MLGV, with the remaining 49% owned by Teachers'. The following month MLGV announced that they had reached an agreement to purchase the 60.3% of MLGL held by Harold's estate for $34 a share or $75 million total, valuing the company at $125 million. The estate still owned Stavro $23 million at the time. Molson also sold its 19.9% of MLGL to MLGV in April 1994 for $25 million. Larry Tanenbaum's company Kilmer Sports purchased a 25% share of MLGH from Stavro in 1996 for a reported $21 million.\n\nMLGV subsequently purchased all the remaining shares and took MLGL private in 1998, after acquiring more than the 90% of stock necessary to force objecting shareholders out, and MLGL and MLGV amalgamated. The purchase was the subject of an Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) review, due to allegations that MLGV had engaged in insider trading by failing to disclose that broadcast revenue was expected to substantially increase, and a $50 million lawsuit from Bill who claimed that Stavro and others devalued MLGL and withheld information relevant to the value of the company prior to the sale of his stock. Ontario's Office of the Public Trustee, which was charged with representing the charities named by Harold's will as beneficiaries, argued that Stavro had a conflict of interest as both executor of the will and buyer and had not paid market value because there was no public bidding process for the shares. Several minority owners, including Harry Ornest, who held 3.5% of the company, and Jim Devellano also objected to MLGV's attempts to take the company private without an auction. Stavro and his partners in MLGV reached a settlement in 1996 to pay an additional $23.5 million plus interest to the charities as well as $2.5 million to the minority shareholders who had sued, clearing the way for them to become the majority owner of MLGL. They also settled with the OSC in 1999 for $1.6 million, which included a fine and costs. Teachers' invested $44.3 million and TD $9.75 million in the deal.\n\nFollowing the merger, the ownership structure of the now defunct MLGV was retained by MLGL. MLGH was the majority owner of MLGL, holding 51% of the company. It in turn was controlled by Stavro (55%), with minority shareholders Tanenbaum (25%) and TD Capital Group (20%). The remaining 49% of MLGL was owned by Teachers'. This tiered ownership structure gave Stavro effective control of MLGL with only a net 29% stake of the company. Teachers' invested a further $50 million in the company in the form of a convertible bond in 1998 to finance the purchase of the Raptors and ACC and complete construction of the arena.\n\nIn 2003 an agreement was reached to restructure the company with Stavro selling his stake to Bell Globemedia for a reported $120–150-million after debt repayments, the other partners converting their debts into equity, and each partner getting a direct ownership stake in the newly renamed MLSE, with MLGH being dissolved. This left Teachers' as the controlling majority owners of MLSE with 58.4%, and minority partners Bell Globemedia (15.4%), TD Capital with (13.5%) and Tanenbaum, who took over as non-executive chairman, with 13%. Each owner of MLSE had a right of first refusal on any shares sold, in proportion to their ownership share. The same year MLSE was internally valued at over $1 billion by Teachers' in its annual report. In 2008 the Toronto Star reported that a valuation commissioned by the company concluded that the company was worth US$1.5 billion. On December 5, 2008 CTVglobemedia (the renamed Bell Globemedia) sold half of its 15.4% stake to Tanenbaum for $100 million, making Tanenbaum the second-largest stakeholder with 20.7%. The transaction valued the company at $1.2 billion. On August 20, 2009 Teachers' announced that it had agreed to purchase the remaining 7.7% stake in MLSE owned by CTVglobemedia, bumping their stake to 66%.\n\nIn December 2010 it was reported that Rogers Communications, owner of the Toronto Blue Jays, was in negotiations to purchase the Teachers' 66% stake in MLSE, with the asking price set at $1.3 billion, and in March 2011 Teachers' confirmed that their share in the company was up for sale. Tanenbaum's right of first refusal on the shares gave him control over any sale by Teachers'. In May 2011 Teachers' announced that they had reached an agreement to purchase TD Capital's 13.5% ownership share, giving them 79.5% of the company and leaving Tanenbaum as the only minority partner with 20.5%, simplifying a sale of their shares.\n\nIn November 2011 Teachers' announced that they were taking the company off the market. However, only a couple of weeks later, on December 9, 2011, Teachers' announced the sale of its entire stake in MLSE to a partnership between BCE Inc. and Rogers Communications, in a deal valued at $1.32 billion, giving the company an equity value of $1.66 billion and an enterprise value of $2 billion due to the assumption of their share of MLSE's $372 million in debt and $66 million in leases. As part of the deal, Tanenbaum increased his stake in the company by 5%, valued at $109 million, to 25% to secure his approval. The deal required the approval of Canada's Competition Bureau, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (with regards to MLSE's TV channels), as well as the NHL, the AHL, the NBA, and MLS (with regards to each of MLSE's main sports franchises).\n\nThe Competition Bureau announced in May 2012 that it would not challenge the transaction, but that it will \"actively review\" the situation in light of \"serious concerns\" expressed by various parties, reserving the right to take action at a later date. The NHL Board of Governors approved the sale at a meeting in Las Vegas on June 19, 2012. The final approval, that of the CRTC, was granted on August 16, with the commission noting that it only had jurisdiction over the TV channels owned by MLSE (the transfer of ownership from MLSE to Bell, Rogers and Kilmer directly, it decided, posed no major concerns), and not the broadcast rights associated with MLSE's teams. The transaction closed on August 22, 2012.\n\nAs part of the sale, two numbered companies were created to jointly hold stock. Following the restructuring, the ownership hierarchy of MLSE was:\n\nThis ownership structure ensures that, at the shareholder level, Rogers and Bell vote their overall 75% interest in the company together and thus decisions on the management of the company must be made by consensus of the two. (If Rogers and Bell owned their interests directly, either Rogers or Bell could be overruled by its competitor in combination with Tanenbaum.) As such, Rogers and Bell have agreed that their previously four of six (now six of eight) directors on the MLSE board will always vote together, and thus that any disagreements between the two companies will be settled privately without the involvement of Tanenbaum. Bell has indicated that the involvement of Bell's pension fund is, at least in part, intended to ensure Bell can retain its existing 18% interest in the Montreal Canadiens, as NHL rules prevent any shareholder that owns more than 30% of a team from holding an ownership position in any other team. As a result of Bell and Rogers having co-ownership in MLSE, the regional broadcasts of Maple Leafs and Toronto FC games are split between Bell's TSN and Rogers' Sportsnet; the national rights to the Raptors and the NBA overall are also split between TSN and Sportsnet.\n\nIn 2015 MLSE initiated a corporate restructuring, with the plan to transfer most of its assets to another holding company, named \"Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Partnership\" (MLSEP), which would be wholly owned, directly and indirectly, by MLSE.\n\n\nNote that the valuations are estimates done by \"Forbes\", and are not based on numbers provided by MLSE. MLSE has refuted past valuations made by \"Forbes\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His departure from this rural environment came with his enrollment in Prague University where he was to become acquainted with the nationalist fervor among students there. Rieger studied at the university to become a lawyer, and also received a strong education in economic science, a subject which would later be the topic of much of his published political literature. He and his fellow “national awakeners” found inspiration for their patriotism in the Polish uprising of 1830. Many political Polish refugees fled to Prague where they shared their ideas with the young Czech nationalists there. Rieger’s sympathy for the Poles was so that he was even arrested for hiding a refugee in his room at the University.\n\nRieger’s first venture into the political scene of Czech politics came with the Revolution of 1848. Rieger was among the attendees to the constituent assembly meeting in July 1848 in Vienna. His appearance at the assembly was spectacular. He exemplified his skill in oration, and reputedly gained a reputation for his righteous defense of popular sovereignty. For the first time, he was rubbing shoulders with prominent Czech intellectuals and leaders, including the historian František Palacký, with whom he was soon to become close friends. The constitution which he and his fellow assembly members together drafted was woven from the notions of Austroslavism, which advocated allowing Bohemia to become an autonomous federal state within the empire. The new emperor, Franz Joseph, found the constitution too radical to accept and flatly rejected it.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the proposal for the Bohemian constitution, Rieger spent the next two years in voluntary exile between France and Great Britain. On his returning to Prague in 1851, he applied to become a professor of economics at Prague University where he studied. However, his application, which included his doctorate on economics, was refused by the administration for political reasons. Rieger continued to pursue economic science and became a prolific writer of economic literature. For his contribution, he has been accredited with begin the founder of Czech economic literature. For the next several years, he set to work on a number of projects intended to advance the Czech cultural heritage. In 1858 he started the \"Slovník naučný\" (\"Reference Book\"), the Czech encyclopedia of general knowledge, the first volume of which was published in 1859, the 11th and last in 1874. He was also instrumental in founding the first Czech political daily newspaper published in Prague, which appeared on 1 January 1861 and of which he was for a while the editor. In 1853 Rieger married Marie Palacká, the daughter of his close friend and political associate from the assembly, František Palacký.\n\nRieger’s refuge from politics was ended suddenly by the downfall of the Bach administration in Vienna in 1859. Francis Joseph’s October Diploma, which officially divided the empire into the dualist Astro-Hungarian monarchy, left Rieger and many Czechs nationalists dissatisfied with the lack of response by the government towards their wish for autonomy. Not wishing to be outshined by their Magyar competition, the Czechs of the National Party, led by Palacký took action. In 1861, Palacký, though continuing to serve as an influential member of the party, passed official leadership to Rieger. Now in control, Rieger set to work on another petitioned constitution to present to Francis Joseph. Despite Rieger’s employment of his skill for writing political literature, the proposal was ignored by the emperor altogether. Increasingly dejected and frustrated, Rieger led his party to boycott the Bohemian Diet and newly created Austrian Reichsrat. This policy of passive resistance would characterize the Czech relation to Austria for the next twenty years. Czech pride, however, hardly swayed the Emperor or Reichstrat who were more than happy to not be bothered by the Czechs. Rieger attempted a constitution a second time in 1871, when he conducted negotiations with the Hohenenwarth ministry for a federal constitution of the empire, which broke down owing to his extreme attitude in the matter of Bohemian independence.\n\nWithin the National Party itself a number of significant developments were taking place under the leadership of Rieger. He appealed to Napoleon III to support the Czech movement, in spite the unease felt by some members towards the authoritarian regime of France. In terms of its political ideology, the party became increasingly conservative in its attempts to win over the Bohemian nobility. Rieger understood that the nobles had no real interest in nationalism and that the party was becoming increasingly isolated from its liberal roots. However, support of the nobles meant access to the court, a political advantage which he could not afford to lose. In addition to allying the party to the nobles, Rieger took significant steps to tie the party to the Catholic Church. Although a non-practicing Catholic himself, Rieger attended a number of Church pilgrimages and meetings. In his view, the Church and its role in Czech history offered to the nationalist struggle a sense of historical unity and significance. Rieger’s image was also threatened by his failure to recognize the significance of Panslavism. In 1867, his journey with Palacký to Moscow to attend a convention in protest of dualism was falsely interpreted by the Czech press to be a symbolic gesture towards Pan-Slavism. Rieger often failed to recognize the impression his contacts with other slavs created for his public image, especially to Germans fearful of a panslavic conspiracy.\n\nIn spite of this evidence of his popularity, his conservatism, his close connection with the Bohemian nobility and his clerical tendencies brought Rieger into conflict with the growing influence of the radical Young Czech party. The National Party was now divided between the Young Czechs and the Old Czechs, headed by Rieger. Indeed, to the younger generation of nationalists, Rieger seemed old and out of touch, as indicated by his comment in 1883 that an educated Czech need a perfect command of German. After the division of the party, he became increasingly conservative in his policies. He ended his boycott of the Diet and Reichstrat in 1879, and was one of the leaders of the federalist majority supporting Count Taaffe's conservative coalition of Iron Ring. Although the Old Czech continued to dominate for another decade, in 1891, they were defeated in the polls by the Young Czechs.\n\nBy the end of his political career, Rieger had become an esteemed politician. On his seventieth birthday (10 December 1888) he received a national gift of 100,000 gulden. In March 1897 he was created a baron (Freiherr) and given a seat in the Upper House. He continued occasionally to interfere in politics; but his influence was now at an end, though when he died, on 3 March 1903, his funeral in Prague was made the occasion of a magnificent demonstration of respect.\n\n\n"}

It was published in 1957 and made its debut in the film \"Tammy and the Bachelor\". It was nominated for the 1957 Oscar for Best Original Song. \"Tammy\" is heard in the film in two versions. The one that became a number one hit single for Debbie Reynolds in 1957 is heard midway through the film, and was a UK  2 hit single in the same year. The version that used for the film's main titles was a hit for the Ames Brothers; there have also been several other cover versions of the song.\n\nThe song's title served as the inspiration for Berry Gordy's first record label. In 1959, Gordy set up a new record company, and wanted to call it \"Tammy Records\" after the song, but the name was taken and \"Tamla\" was chosen instead. The main Motown label was created later that year and the two labels were incorporated into the Motown Record Corporation in 1960. Tamla served as a primary R&B and soul subsidiary throughout Motown's existence.\n\nThe most popular version, by actress and singer Debbie Reynolds, was released by Coral Records as catalog number 61851. The backing orchestrations were done by Joseph Gershinson. It first reached the \"Billboard\" charts on July 22, 1957, and peaked at No. 1 on all the US charts: the Disk Jockey chart, the Best Seller chart, and the composite chart of the top 100 songs. The single \"Tammy\" earned her a gold record. It is featured in the films \"The Long Day Closes\", \"The Big Lebowski\", and \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\", and was sampled in the song \"A Different Feeling\" by Australian electronic band The Avalanches on their 2000 album \"Since I Left You\".\n\nA recording by the Ames Brothers, heard over the main titles of \"Tammy and the Bachelor\", also charted. It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 47-6930. It first reached the \"Billboard\" charts on July 22, 1957. On the Disk Jockey chart, it peaked at No. 5; on the Best Seller chart, at No. 24; on the composite chart of the top 100 songs, it reached No. 29. On the \"Cash Box\" charts, where all versions were combined, the song reached No. 1.\n\n"}
{"id": "2127649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127649", "title": "Hawker Siddeley P.1127", "text": "Hawker Siddeley P.1127\n\nThe Hawker P.1127 and the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel FGA.1 are the experimental and development aircraft that led to the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, the first \"vertical and/or short take-off and landing\" (V/STOL) jet fighter-bomber. P.1127 development began in 1957, taking advantage of the Bristol Engine Company's choice to invest in the creation of the Pegasus vectored-thrust engine. Testing began in July 1960 and by the end of the year the aircraft had achieved both vertical take-off and horizontal flight. The test program also explored the possibility of use upon aircraft carriers, landing on in 1963. The first three aircraft crashed during testing, one at the 1963 Paris Air Show.\n\nImprovements to future development aircraft, such as swept wings and more powerful Pegasus engines, led to the development of the Kestrel. The Kestrel was evaluated by the Tri-partite Evaluation Squadron, made up of military pilots from the United Kingdom, the United States, and West Germany. Later flights were conducted by the U.S. military and NASA.\n\nRelated work on a supersonic aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, was cancelled in 1965. As a result, the P.1127 (RAF), a variant more closely based on the Kestrel, was ordered into production that year, and named \"Harrier\" - the name originally intended for the P.1154 - in 1967. The Harrier served with the UK and several nations, often as a carrier-based aircraft.\n\nFollowing the end of the Korean War, a number of aircraft companies in both Europe and America separately decided to investigate the prospective of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, which would eliminate the requirement for vulnerable runways by taking off and landing vertically as opposed to the conventional horizontal approach. In addition to military applications, the prospect of applying such technology to commercial airliners was also viewed with considerable interest by the mid 1950s, thus the value of developing viable vertical take-off systems was judged to be substantial. However, even during this era, few companies had envisioned that a VTOL aircraft would also be realistically compatible with the characteristics of high performance military aircraft.\n\nIn 1957, jet engine engineer Stanley Hooker of the Bristol Engine Company informed aeronautics engineer Sydney Camm of Hawker Aircraft that Bristol had been working a project that combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet. The projected fan jet harnessed rotatable \"cold\" jets which were positioned on either side of the compressor along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe. The original concept upon which the engine, which had been named \"Pegasus\", was based came from Michel Wibault, a French aviation consultant. Several adaptions and enhancements were made by Bristol to reduce size and weight over Wibault's original concept.\n\nAround the same point as Hooker's approach, Hawker had been working upon the development of a replacement fighter aircraft for the Hawker Hunter, designated as the \"P.1121\". However, the P.1121 was cancelled shortly after the publishing of the 1957 Defence White Paper, which had advocated a policy shift away from manned aircraft and towards missiles. In light of this cancellation, Hawker found itself with the available resources to commit to a new project, and thus decided to study the use of the projected Pegasus engine as a basis for a new military aeroplane that would be able to conform with an active NATO specification that sought a new Light Tactical Support Fighter to replace the Fiat G.91, particular attention was paid to meeting the specification's performance and load requirements.\n\nAccording to Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine, Hawker's interest may have also been stimulated by the presence of Air Staff Requirement 345, which sought a V/STOL ground attack fighter for the Royal Air Force (RAF). Aviation author Francis K. Mason expressed a contrary view, stating that Hawker's decision to proceed was independent of British government initiatives, and that the P.1127 project was primarily based upon the NATO requirement instead. Hawker had a keen ally in its development in the form of Bristol, but by that point the latter was experiencing financial difficulties, and the lack of foreseeable commercial applications for the Pegasus engine in particular, coupled with refusals from HM Treasury, mean that development would have to be financed by NATO institutions instead. The close cooperation between Hawker and Bristol was viewed by project engineer Gordon Lewis as a key factors which had enabled the P.1127's development to proceed in spite of technical obstacles and political setbacks.\n\nSenior project engineer Ralph Hooper at Hawker promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft to take advantage of the Pegasus engine, using data provided by Bristol. This proposed aircraft soon received the internal designation \"P.1127\". In July 1957, a modification made to the design was the incorporation of a bifurcated tailpipe, similar to the Hawker Sea Hawk, which was equipped with rotatable nozzles for the hot exhaust, similar those already used for the cold exhaust. The switch from a single tailpipe meant that the initial tailwheel undercarriage could also be discarded in favour a conventional nose wheel-led undercarriage. The design process extended throughout 1958, being financed entirely by Hawker, while approaches were made to NATO headquarters (Belgium) better establish the tactical requirements sought, particularly between the conflicting demands for a lightly armed supersonic fighter and a simpler multipurpose subsonic one.\n\nThe development process had involved extensive use of physical models; for one series of blowing trials, mixtures of focused hot and cold air were directed onto ground platforms to simulate the ground effect upon take-off. This work was considered to be critical to the project as there was very little knowledge of the adverse effects which could influence the aircraft during the vertical takeoff process; as there was no airflow over the ailerons, tailplane, and rudder while the aircraft was held in a stationary hover, wingtip control jets were experimented with as an alternative reaction control approach. These research included the development of an all-new control response simulator which linked a series of simple flying controls to a computer. By the end of 1958, barely eighteen months after the start of the project, all the main features of the P.1127 were developed with one exception, that being the reaction control system, the development of which was completed by April 1959.\n\nThroughout the development, Camm heavily emphasised the importance of the design's simplicity, observing that \"Sophistication means complication, then in turn escalation, cancellation, and finally ruination\". In 1958, the design centered around a single Pegasus engine capable of generating 13,000 lb of thrust; when fully equipped, the aircraft was to weight slightly less than the maximum thrust, thereby allowing vertical takeoffs to be performed under all nominal conditions. During late 1958, the rapid progress of the P.1127 project had been noticed by technical advisors at NATO, who began promoting the acceleration of the aircraft's development and that member nations should skip over the next generation of support fighters in favour of the emergent P.1127 instead. In Britain, support for the program was also growing within the British Air Staff, from January 1959 onwards, rumours of a pair of P.1127 prototypes being ordered by the Ministry of Supply alongside those of an Air Ministry specification being drafted around the project frequently echoed.\n\nAs the P.1127 had been developed at a time of deep UK defense cuts, Hawker had to seek commercial funding, and significant engine development funding came from the U.S. Research assistance was also provided by U.S.; including a series of wind tunnel tests conducted by NASA's Langley Research Center using sub-scale models, which demonstrated acceptable flight characteristics. Hawker test pilot Hugh Merewether went to the U.S. at NASA's request to fly the Bell X-14. In March 1959, the company's board of directors (Hawker Siddeley then) decided to privately fund two P.1127 prototypes.\n\nIn February 1959, Hawker had completed practically all of the design work and thus passed the entirety of its manufacturing design work to the company's Experimental Design Office at Kingston, London. In April 1959, the Ministry of Supply formally issued a contract for the completion of a pair of P.1127 prototypes. However, there were critics amongst the Air Staff of the project, typically disliking the P.1127 for its subsonic speeds, favouring supersonic-capable aircraft instead; Mason attributes this as having caused considerable delay in the issuing of a contract to Hawker. On 23 July 1959, Hawker authorised the application of maximum effort to complete the development of the P.1127.\n\nOn 15 July 1960, the first \"P.1127 Prototype V/STOL Strike Aircraft\", serial \"XP831\", was delivered to Dunsfold Aerodrome, Surrey, to commence static engine testing. On 31 August 1960, the Pegasus engine was run for the first time while inside the airframe. Some of the tests were performed from a purpose-built platform at the aerodrome which functioned to deflect the hot exhaust gases away from the aircraft during early hovering trials while more powerful versions of the engine were developed. On 13 October 1960, the first Pegasus flight engine, capable of generating 11,300 lb of thrust, was delivered to Dunsfold.\n\nOn 21 October 1960, the initial tethered flight, performed by XP831, was conducted at Dunsfold; at this stage of development, this feat had required the airframe to have been stripped of all extraneous weight and restrictions on the engine meant it could not be run at full power for more than 2.5 minutes at a time. Several tethered flights took place, partially so that the test pilots could familiarise themselves with the hovering controls; on 4 November, the first tethered flight without use of the auto-stabiliser system was accomplished. In mid-November, conventional taxying trials were performed at speeds of up to 70 knots.\n\nOn 19 November 1960, the first un-tethered free-flight hover of XP831 was achieved; a week later, the first publicity photos of the P.1127 were released. Prior to the first flight, Hooker is claimed to have asked of Camm \"I suppose you are going to do some conventional flying first Sydney?\" and Camm replied \"What for?\" Hooker said \"Well you know, just to make sure the aeroplane is a nice aeroplane, and everything under control.\" Camm replied, \"Oh, Hawker aeroplanes are always beautiful, nothing wrong with a Hawker aeroplane, not going to bother with that. Vertical first time\".\n\nOn 13 February 1961, XP831 performed its first conventional flight, flown by Bill Bedford and lasting for 22 minutes. Soon after this, XP831 was refitted with a new model of the Pegasus engine, capable of generating 12,000 lb of thrust, prior to embarking on new hovering trials in May 1961. In June, XP831 attained another milestone in the program when it performed the first transition from vertical hover to horizontal flight, initially flying the length of Dunsfold's runway at a height of 50 meters.\n\nOn 7 July 1961, the second prototype, \"XP836\", performed its first take off conventionally. Continuing tests of the two prototypes proceeded to close the gap between vertical take off and flight, a feat which was achieved on 8 September 1961. During September, the feat was repeated multiple times by both prototypes, transitioning from vertical to horizontal flight and vice versa, including instances in which the auto-stabiliser was intentionally disabled.\n\nDuring the flight test program, the issuing of NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3) did not prove to be the opportunity as envisioned by Hawker, as NBMR-3 sought performance characteristics of which the P.1127 was not only unable to meet, but unlikely to be developed to meet in its current form either. As such, in 1961, there was little military interest in the P.1127 program, although, in January 1961, Hawker was requested to provide a quote for the costs involved in a potential 100 production standard P.1127 aircraft. Meanwhile, Hawker believed that the continuing development of the P.1127 would serve a successful demonstration, acting to dissuade potential customers from pursuing competing 'paper' VTOL aircraft projects.\n\nOn 2 November 1960, the Ministry of Supply issued a contract for a further four prototypes to be produced, which were intended to develop the aircraft further towards being a realistic combat design, such as the refinement of the wing, engine improvements, and of accompanying operational equipment. Throughout this period, improved models of the Pegasus engine were rapidly developed, such as the Pegasus 3 being capable of 15,000 lbf (67 kN) of thrust. Apart from the improved powerplants, the first four P.1127 prototypes were quite similar; the fifth prototype, \"XP980\", introduced the taller fin and tailplane anhedral which were later used on the production Harrier. The fourth machine was partially used to provide Hawker production test pilots with type familiarisation. The first carrier vertical landing was performed by the first prototype on in 1963. The last P.1127, \"XP984\", introduced the swept wing. It was eventually fitted with the 15,000 lbf (66.7 kN) Pegasus 5 and functioned as the prototype Kestrel.\n\nThe first three P.1127s crashed, the second and third occurring during development. In 1963, the first prototype, \"XP831\", publicly crashed at the Paris Air Show; the accident had been caused by a speck of dirt in the air feed lines of the nozzle control motor, which had caused the engine nozzles to stick. \"XP831\" was later fully repaired and resumed development flying. All the pilots involved survived.\n\nBy late 1961, Hawker had been able to demonstrate the validity of its design concept, despite a lack of support from the RAF and little from the Her Majesty's Civil Service. In early 1962, official support emerged in the form of the Operational Requirements branch of the Ministry of Aviation, which approached the Treasury seeking its sanction of a batch of nine production-standard aircraft to be operated by an evaluation unit to be administered by the Central Fighter Establishment at RAF West Raynham. In light of open interest expressed by figures within the U.S. and West Germany, the British government approached these nations with an offer to collaborate on the project and to seek contributions towards the cost involved. Following the acceptance of all three nations, on 22 May 1962, Hawker received a formal Instruction to Proceed with the procurement of materials for the construction of the nine aircraft.\n\nThe nine aircraft were ordered as the \"Kestrel FGA.1\", which was essentially an improved version of the P.1127. On 7 March 1964, \"XS688\" became the first Kestrel to conduct its maiden flight, flown by Bill Bedford. The Kestrel had fully swept wings and a larger tail than the early P.1127s, and the fuselage was modified to take the larger 15,000 lbf (85 kN) Pegasus 5 engine as in the P.1127/Kestrel prototype \"XP984\", in addition to some other changes, such as addition of ultra high frequency (UHF) radio and assorted operational equipment in a bay house within the rear fuselage. Prior to the availability of the Kestrel for testing, a pair of NASA pilots visited Dunsfold to perform a complete set of handling trials using the earlier P.1127 in its place.\n\nOn 15 October 1964, the Tri-partite Evaluation Squadron (TES) was formed at RAF West Raynham, staffed by a diverse mix of military test pilots from Britain, the United States and West Germany. The personnel comprising the squadron were highly experienced pilots; prior to flying the Kestrel, each received a week's ground training at Bristol's in-house facility and a week's ground instruction at Dunsfold prior to a three-hour flight conversion instructed by Bill Bedford. The purpose of the squadron was to evaluate the suitability of V/STOL aircraft for field operations, compare competing styles and methods of taking off/landing, develop normal flight operating procedures, perform instrument flight assessments, conduct night flight operations, and explore jet-borne maneuvering throughout the Kestrel's flight envelope.\n\nDuring the course of the evaluation, the Tri-partite pilots developed a typical sortie routine for the Kestrel of conducting short take-offs (STO) and returning to base on vertical landings. This manner of operation (STOVL) was judged to be the optimal practice. Operating from rough airstrips was also trialled at nearby RAF Bircham Newton, where the aircraft proved adept at traversing boggy ground and taking off from a variety of temporary ground coverings. During testing one aircraft was lost when a pilot tried to do a rolling take-off with the parking brake on; the evaluations were finalised in November 1965.\n\nSix of the eight surviving evaluation aircraft (the three allocated to the U.S. plus those allocated to Germany) were transferred to the U.S. for evaluation by the Army, Air Force, and Navy as the \"XV-6A Kestrel\". After Tri-Service evaluation they were passed to the USAF for further evaluation at Edwards Air Force Base, except for two that were assigned to NASA. One of the two remaining British-based Kestrels was attached to the \"Blind Landing Experimental Unit\" (BLEU) at RAE Bedford and the other, \"XS693\", went to Blackburn for modification to take the uprated Pegasus 6 engine.\n\nIn addition to some strengthening, there were alterations to the air intake, which had throughout the P.1127 and Kestrel series featured an inflatable lip to smooth the intake airflow when the aircraft was almost stationary. There were concerns about the service life of these devices, so they were replaced with conventional suction relief doors. Experience gained during naval testing on board the commando carrier HMS \"Bulwark\" in 1966 convinced project officers that less reactive materials would be substituted for all uses of magnesium in the Kestrel's airframe, in any further prototypes and production aircraft. The Kestrel became the prototype for pre-production Harriers.\n\nIn 1961, NATO issued NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3) which specified a VTOL aircraft, albeit one with the supersonic performance of an aircraft such as the F-4 Phantom II, along with the VTOL capability. Recognising that the P.1127 would not satisfy this, Hawker commenced work upon a new project, designated \"P.1150\", which was effectively a supersonic derivative of the P.1127, as well as another version, designated \"P.1154\", which would meet the specified requirements of NBMR-3. The P.1154 was declared the winner of the NATO competition; prototype construction was already underway at the point of cancellation in 1965. The French government had withdrawn shortly after the P.1154's selection over the Dassault Mirage IIIV.\n\nFollowing the termination of the P.1154, the RAF then began studying a straightforward upgrade of the Kestrel as a production aircraft; accordingly, it issued Requirement ASR 384, which sought a V/STOL ground attack jet, known as the \"P.1127 (RAF)\". In late 1965, the RAF placed an order for six pre-production P.1127 (RAF) aircraft. On 31 August 1966, the first of these P.1127 (RAF) aircraft made its maiden flight. In early 1967, an order for 60 production aircraft was formally received by Hawker Aviation; at this time the aircraft received the \"Harrier GR.1\" designation. The Harrier went on to become a successful aircraft in British service, and was exported to several nations, often seeing usage as a carrier-based aircraft.\n\nThe P.1127/Kestrel was an experimental V/STOL aircraft, which served as the forerunner for the production of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and the wider Harrier Jump Jet family. It served to demonstrate an entirely original technique of flight, as well as to trial a brand new type of engine in the form of the Pegasus turbofan engine. Despite this, the aircraft employed a principally conventional structure which, according to Mason, lent itself favourably to performing the intended ground attack operations envisioned for production aircraft.\n\nThe location of the large Pegasus engine, which was housed within the relatively small fuselage, meant that the cockpit was positioned directly forward of it, in between the later \"elephant-ear\" air intakes to the engine itself. The 'cold' jet exhaust was directed from the large fan forward of the engine compressor to rotatable fiberglass nozzles located on the sides of the main fuselage aft of the air intakes; the 'hot' jet exhaust from the rear of the engine were channeled via a bifurcated exhaust channel to two steel rotatable nozzles located somewhat aft of those used for the 'cold' jets. Additionally, bleed air was also extracted from the compressor and sent via ducts within the fuselage and wings to control nozzles, known as \"puffers\", located upon the aircraft's nose, tail, and wing tips, which were used for stabilisation during mid-air hovers.\n\nThe aircraft was furnished with a single-piece shoulder-mounted wing mounted across the top of the fuselage; the shape of the wing progressively alters from a clipped delta to a fully swept configuration, complete with extended leading edges and spaced out sawtooth extensions. A fully movable single-piece tailplane was also adopted, which was hinged upon the rear fuselage. The P.1127 had an atypical undercarriage arrangement, known as a \"zero-track\" tricycle undercarriage, which supported the majority of the aircraft's weight upon a pair of centrally mounted main wheels; steering was performed via a conventional nose wheel while balance was provided by a pair of wing tip-mounted outriggers.\nThe P.1127 was equipped with entirely conventional flying controls when operated within the normal flying regime; to avoid aerodynamic stall conditions when decelerating to slow speeds, control would be gradually and automatically transferred to the reaction jets, or \"puffers\", by bleeding more air from the compressor as the engine nozzles were moved towards the downwards position. An auto-stabilisation system was installed upon all aircraft; the necessity of such a feature is arguable, as countless transitions between vertical and horizontal flight were performed with the auto-stabiliser equipment being entirely disabled.\n\nThe P.1127 lacked any in-built armaments, the ethos of tactical flexibility meant a reliance upon underwing hard point-mounted munitions and equipment, which included multiple 2-inch rocket batteries, 30-mm ADEN cannon gun pods, and 1,000 lb bombs, napalm, and range-extending drop tanks. The prototypes were furnished with long nose-mounted instrumentation booms, these were replaced on the Kestrel with a much smaller counterpart on the fin to enable the nose to accommodate a tactical camera instead. An unusual feature of the P.1127 was the installation of a ram air turbine upon the rear fuselage just forward of the fin to provide power for ancillary services in the event of engine failure.\n\n\n\n"}

It covers Europe (without the Iberian Peninsula and the British Isles), North Africa, and parts of Asia, including the Middle East, Persia, and India. According to one hypothesis, the existing map is based on a document of the 4th or 5th century that contained a copy of the world map originally prepared by Agrippa during the reign of the emperor Augustus (27 BC – AD 14). However, Emily Albu has suggested that the existing map could instead be based on an original from the Carolingian period.\n\nNamed after the 16th-century German antiquarian Konrad Peutinger, the map is now conserved at the Austrian National Library in Vienna.\n\nThe \"Tabula\" is thought to be a distant descendant of the map prepared under the direction of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, a Roman general, architect, and friend of emperor Augustus. After Agrippa's death in 12 BC, that map was engraved in marble and put on display in the \"Porticus Vipsania\" in the \"Campus Agrippae\" area in Rome, close to the \"Ara Pacis\" building. \n\nThe early imperial dating for the archetype of the map is supported by American historian Glen Bowersock, and is based on numerous details of Roman Arabia that look entirely anachronistic for a 4th-century map. Bowersock concluded that the original source is likely the map made by Vipsanius Agrippa. This dating is also consistent with the map's inclusion of the Roman town of Pompeii near modern-day Naples, which was never rebuilt after it had been destroyed in an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79.\n\nThe original Roman map, of which this may be the only surviving copy, was last revised in the 4th or early 5th century. It shows the city of Constantinople, founded in 328, and the prominence of Ravenna, seat of the Western Roman Empire from 402 to 476, which suggests a fifth-century revision according to Levi and Levi. The presence of certain cities of Germania Inferior that were destroyed in the mid-fifth century also provides a \"terminus ante quem\", i.e. the map's latest creation date, though Emily Albu suggests that this information could have been preserved in textual, not cartographic, form.\n\nThe \"Tabula Peutingeriana\" is thought to be the only known surviving map of the Roman \"cursus publicus\", the state-run road network. The surviving map itself was created by a monk in Colmar in modern-day eastern France in 1265. It is a parchment scroll, high and long, assembled from eleven sections, a medieval reproduction of the original scroll.\nIt is a very schematic map, designed to give a practical overview of the road network, as opposed to an accurate representation of geographic features: the land masses shown are distorted, especially in the east–west direction. The map shows many Roman settlements and the roads connecting them, as well as other features such as rivers, mountains, forests and seas. The distances between settlements are also given. In total no fewer than 555 cities and 3,500 other place names are shown on the map. The three most important cities of the Roman Empire at the time – Rome, Constantinople and Antioch – are represented with special iconic decoration.\n\nBesides the totality of the empire, the map also shows areas in the Near East, India and the Ganges, Sri Lanka (\"Insula Taprobane\"), and even an indication of China. It even shows a \"Temple to Augustus\" at Muziris (present day Kodungallur) on the modern-day Malabar Coast, one of the main ports for trade with the Roman Empire on the southwest coast of India. On the western end of the scroll, the absence of Morocco, the Iberian Peninsula, and the British Isles indicates that a twelfth original section has been lost in the surviving copy; the missing section was reconstructed in 1898 by Konrad Miller.\n\nThe map appears to be based on \"itineraries\", lists of destinations along Roman roads, as the distances between points along the routes are indicated. Travelers would not have possessed anything so sophisticated as a modern map, but they needed to know what lay ahead of them on the road and how far. The Peutinger Table represents these roads as a series of stepped lines along which destinations have been marked in order of travel. The shape of the parchment pages accounts for the conventional rectangular layout. However, a rough similarity to the coordinates of Ptolemy's earth-mapping gives some writers hope that some terrestrial representation was intended by the unknown original compilers.\n\nThe stages and cities are represented by hundreds of functional place symbols, used with discrimination from the simplest icon of a building with two towers to the elaborate individualized \"portraits\" of the three great cities. The editors Annalina and Mario Levi concluded that the semi-schematic, semi-pictorial symbols reproduce Roman cartographic conventions of the \"itineraria picta\" described by 4th-century writer Vegetius, of which this is the sole known testimony.\n\nThe map was discovered in a library in the city of Worms by German scholar Conrad Celtes in 1494, who was unable to publish his find before his death and bequeathed the map in 1508 to Konrad Peutinger, a German humanist and antiquarian in Augsburg, after whom the map is named. The Peutinger family kept possession of the map for more than two hundred years until it was sold in 1714. It then bounced between several royal and elite families until it was purchased by Prince Eugene of Savoy for 100 ducats; upon his death in 1737, it was purchased for the Habsburg Imperial Court Library in Vienna (\"\"). It is today conserved at the Austrian National Library at the Hofburg palace in Vienna.\n\nIn 2007, the map was placed on the UNESCO's Memory of the World Register, and in recognition of this, it was displayed to the public for a single day on 26 November 2007. Because of its fragile condition, it is not usually on public display.\n\nThe map was copied for Dutch cartographer Abraham Ortelius and published shortly after his death in 1598. A partial first edition was printed at Antwerp in 1591 (titled \"Fragmenta tabulæ antiquæ\") by Johannes Moretus, who would print the full \"Tabula\" in December 1598, also at Antwerp. Johannes Janssonius published another version in Amsterdam, c. 1652.\n\nIn 1753 Franz Christoph von Scheyb published a copy, and in 1872 Konrad Miller, a German professor, was allowed to copy the map. Several publishing houses in Europe then made copies. In 1892 publishers Williams and Norgate published a copy in London, and in 1911 a sheet was added showing the reconstructed sections of the British Isles and the Iberian peninsula missing in the original.\n\n\n\n"}

He was deported from Canada for an inflammatory anti-Tutsi speech which his critics allege was a precursor to the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In 2016, he was convicted of incitement to genocide and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nAn ethnic Hutu, Mugesera has been a member of the dominant Hutu MRND party, which had close ties to the military. He was MRND Vice-Chairman for Gisenyi prefecture.\n\nIn a speech given on November 22, 1992 in Rwanda, Mugesera allegedly told 1000 party members that \"we the people are obliged to take responsibility ourselves and wipe out this scum\" and that they should kill Tutsis and \"dump their bodies into the rivers of Rwanda.\" This statement does not exist in the official translation of the speech, as presented in a legal document before the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration of Canada on August 8, 2003.\n\nFollowing this speech, the Rwandan Minister of Justice, Stanislas Mbonampeka, issued an arrest warrant against him for inciting hatred. He fled with his family first to the Rwandan army and then to Quebec City in Quebec, Canada. Shortly afterwards, Mbonampeka resigned as Minister of Justice in protest.\n\nIn Canada, Mugesera and his family arrived as refugees, but were quickly granted permanent resident status. Mugesera secured a job teaching at Université Laval.\n\nPhilip Gourevitch, author of \"We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families\", claims that Mugesera's 1992 speech gave necessary momentum to the anti-Tutsi hysteria that led to the genocide, saying that \"[Mugesera] was one of the first to go in a major public speech and say, 'Look, our mistake in the past with the Tutsi minority has been allowing them to survive, has been allowing them to live. We must get rid of them.'\" This statement does not exist in the official translation of the speech, as presented in a legal document before the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration of Canada on August 8, 2003.\n\nIn 1995, Canadian government lawyers began deportation hearings against Mugesera. Two immigration tribunals ordered his deportation, however, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal overturned these verdicts. Justice Robert Décary, writing for the Court, held that there was no evidence linking the 1992 speech with the genocide which occurred two years later. In all cases Mugesera was represented by Quebec lawyer Guy Bertrand.\n\nOn August 1, 2001, Mugesera issued a statement, requesting a trial under Canada's new Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act.\n\nThe decision of the Federal Court of Appeal was later overturned by an 8-0 decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on June 28, 2005, which upheld the original deportation order. The deportation was delayed because of concerns about the possible use of the death penalty in Rwanda, Rwanda abolished their death penalty in 2007. Mugesera then began fighting his deportation on the basis of fears he would be tortured in Rwanda. As Canada would be reluctant to deport someone who could face torture, Kigali offered Canada \"diplomatic guarantees\" about the treatment of Mugesera.\n\nOn January 23, 2012, a Quebec Superior Court judge rejected Léon Mugesera's bid to avoid deportation. Mugesera was deported via Montreal's international airport the same day by 4 PM.\n\nOn April 15, 2016, Mugesera was convicted of incitement to genocide and inciting ethnic hatred and sentenced to life in prison by a Rwandan court.\n\n\n"}

It was a commercial failure, selling only 2,000 units while originally intended to be produced at the rate of 10,000 a month. It was ended six months after introduction. \n\nThe Sinclair Zike is a portable bicycle with a small electric motor driving the rear wheel and with batteries built into its frame. It weighs 11kg. The batteries fit inside the central shaft together with the motor. It uses nickel–cadmium batteries which have half the weight of the equivalent lead–acid batteries typical of 20th-century electric vehicles, and which can withstand 2000 recharging cycles. A three-position throttle placed under the right handlebar varies the electric power and thus the amount of pedaling required to keep going, although the Zike has only one gear. Battery life is said to be between 30 minutes and three hours depending on which of the three running speeds are used. The batteries can be fully recharged by plugging them into the mains for just one hour, and they are also recharged regeneratively using the energy from pedalling, freewheeling, and braking. The maximum speed of the bicycle operating under its own power was kept below 15 miles per hour to prevent it being classified as a motorcycle under UK law.\n\nThe Sinclair Zike was developed by Sir Clive Sinclair following the commercial failure of the Sinclair C5 in 1985. Electric vehicles were one of his long-term research ambitions. The Zike was financed largely with his own money, and the manufacture was subcontracted to Tudor Webasto, a Birmingham-based company.\n\nThe Zike was launched on 5 March 1992 at the Cyclex exhibition in Olympia, London, when a prototype was demonstrated to both press and public. The price (mail order) was £499, comparable with a top of the range tourer or mountain bike at that time. The initial production target was 10,000 Zikes a month. In May 1993 press reports stated that Tudor Webasto had terminated production because of low sales and that Sinclair was seeking a new manufacturer. In the end only around 2,000 units were sold.\n\nSinclair himself moved on to the development of the Sinclair ZETA (Zero Emission Transport Accessory)—a detachable powerpack intended to sit on the wheel of any bicycle to help power it along.\n\nSinclair put the failure of the Zike down to the business structure of the company manufacturing the bicycle. “We brought out the Zike and that had reasonable success but it hit a snag because the company that was making it for us, on a sub-contract basis, turned out to be a subsidiary of a German company and the German owners came in and closed the whole thing down. Very, very sad.”\n\nThe reviews for the Zike in the British press were somewhat negative (possibly in part due to memories of the C5 which preceded it). Susan Watts for \"The Independent\" called it \"an impressive feat of miniaturisation\" but stated that \"a quick test ride suggested the Zike is too unstable and lacking in power to make a cyclist feel secure on the nightmarish roads of London.\" Similarly Nik Berg for \"Auto Express\" noted that the Zike was lightweight and portable, but expressed concern about the lack of power and stated that \"potholes should be avoided at all costs—the tiny wheels just get swallowed.\"\n\n\n"}

Nicknamed \"Jade Qilin\", he ranks second among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny. In some folk tales, Lu Junyi is portrayed as a martial arts student of Zhou Tong, who purportedly also trained the Song dynasty general Yue Fei in archery.\n\nThe novel depicts Lu Junyi as nine \"chi\" tall, having eyes that sparkle and resembling a majestic deity. A wealthy squire in Daming Prefecture (present-day Daming County, Hebei), he is highly skilled in martial arts, especially in the use of staff and spear. His dominance in combat, impressive appearance and wealth earn him the nickname \"Jade Qilin\". \n\nSong Jiang, the acting chief of the Liangshan bandits after the death of Chao Gai, hears of Lu Junyi's name and wants to recruit him to boost his band. Wu Yong, Liangshan's chief strategist, works out a plan to lure Lu to come close to Liangshan. He disguises himself as a fortune teller and attracts Lu's attention by creating a commotion outside his house. When Lu asks Wu to predict his future, the latter warns that he would die within 100 days. When Lu asks how to avert that fate, Wu tells him to travel southeast for more than 1,000 \"li\". Before leaving, Wu writes a poem on a wall in Lu Junyi's house (see below for details), claiming it will protect him for the time being.\n\nTrusting Wu Yong‘s word, Lu Junyi sets out in the southeast direction with his steward Li Gu and other servants for a temple in Shandong. The group passes by Liangshan Marsh, where the outlaws set an ambush and capture him. Although Lu refuses to join them, his captors retain him for months, treating him as an honoured guest. They release Li Gu first, lying to him that his master has joined them.\n\nUpon reaching home after his long stay at Liangshan, Lu Junyi is shocked to find that Li Gu, who is having an affair with his wife, has reported to the authorities that he is in cahoots with outlaws. Lu is arrested, with Li Gu taking over his properties and his wife. When Lu Junyi is exiled to Shamen Island (沙門島; present-day Changdao County, Shandong), Li bribes his escorts to finish him off along the way. But Lu's faithful servant Yan Qing kills the escorts when they are about to murder him in a wood.\n\nWhen Yan Qing is away looking for food, soldiers track down Lu, who is weak after all the ill treatments. Grand Secretary Liang Shijie, the prefect of Daming Prefecture, orders his immediate execution. But Liangshan's Shi Xiu, who is sent to find out the latest about Lu, storms the execution ground alone. Both end up captured. Liang Shijie keeps them alive as they could be used as hostages should Liangshan attack. What follow are battles between Liangshan and Daming, which proves impregnable. Wu Yong then sends dozens of heroes to sneak into Daming on the Lantern Festival night. They rescue Lu Junyi and Shi Xiu from the prison. Lu kills Li Gu and his infidel wife in revenge and joins the outlaws.\n\nLu Junyi participates in the attack on the Zeng Family Fortress and captures Shi Wengong, the man who killed Liangshan's former chief Chao Gai with an arrow shot. Chao's dying wish was that whoever avenged his death would be his successor. This means Lu Junyi should replace Song Jiang, who has all this while been acting chief. Lu Junyi declines the offer. It is decided that whichever of the two conquers first the prefecture assigned to him - Dongping for Song Jiang and Dongchang for Lu Junyi - would be made chief. Song wins the contest and is elected chief with Lu as second-in-command.\n\nAfter the Liangshan outlaws received amnesty from Emperor Huizong, Lu Junyi continues to be Song Jiang‘s right-hand man as they conduct campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces on Song territory He makes great contributions in the campaigns. To honour his service, the emperor appoints him the governor of Luzhou (廬州; around present-day Hefei, Anhui).\n\nHowever, corrupt officials in the imperial court are not happy that the former outlaws are safe and doing well. They summon Lu Junyi to the capital in the emperor's name and secretly poison the food and drinks served to him. Feeling pain from the poisoning, Lu cannot ride on horseback on his return trip and has to travel by boat. While on a river, he loses his balance and falls into the water. Not able to swim, he drowns. The local authorities retrieve his body and give him a proper burial.\n\nThe poem by Wu Yong is as follows:\n\nThe first Chinese character in each of the four lines (in bold) when combined reads \"\"lu jun yi fan\"\" (), which means \"Lu Junyi rebels\". The \"lu\" (蘆) in the poem is a homonym of the \"lu\" (盧) in Lu Junyi's name. The poem is cited as a proof that Lu Junyi has joined the outlaws.\n\n\n"}

Population density is an example of areal number density. The term number concentration (symbol: lowercase \"n\", or \"C\", to avoid confusion with amount of substance indicated by uppercase \"N\") is sometimes used in chemistry for the same quantity, particularly when comparing with other concentrations.\n\nVolume number density is the number of specified objects per unit volume:\nwhere \"N\" is the total number of objects in a volume \"V\". \n\nHere it is assumed that \"N\" is large enough that rounding of the count to the nearest integer does not introduce much of an error, however \"V\" is chosen to be small enough that the resulting \"n\" does not depend much on the size or shape of the volume \"V\".\n\nIn SI units, number density is measured in m, although cm is often used. However, these units are not quite practical when dealing with atoms or molecules of gases, liquids or solids at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, because the resulting numbers are extremely large (on the order of 10). Using the number density of an ideal gas at and as a yardstick: is often introduced as a unit of number density, for any substances at any conditions (not necessarily limited to an ideal gas at and ).\n\nUsing the number density as a function of spatial coordinates, the total number of objects \"N\" in the entire volume \"V\" can be calculated as\nwhere d\"V\" = d\"x\" d\"y\" d\"z\" is a volume element.

For example, replacing \"m\" with \"q\" (total charge) and \"m\" with \"q\" (charge of each object) in the above equation will lead to a correct expression for charge.\n\nThe number density of solute molecules in a solvent is sometimes called concentration, although usually concentration is expressed as a number of moles per unit volume (and thus called molar concentration).\n\nFor any substance, the number density can be expressed in terms of its amount concentration \"c\" (in mol/m) as\nwhere is the Avogadro constant.

His date of birth is not known, but he was baptised on 1 December 1729. Some earlier sources say he was born on 28 December, but his baptism certificate proves the later date impossible. Already organist at Faenza at age 13, he was invited to receive an education by Padre Martini in Bologna. Resigning his appointment in Faenza in 1750, Sarti devoted himself to the study of dramatic music, becoming director of the Faenza theatre in 1752.\n\nIn 1752 he produced his first documented opera, \"Il re pastore\" (because the date of \"Pompeo in Armenia\" is not certain). In 1753 Sarti went to Copenhagen with Pietro Mingotti and in 1755 King Frederick V of Denmark appointed him Hofkapellmeister and director of the opera. Here he produced his \"Ciro riconosciuto\".\n\nIn 1765 he travelled to Italy to engage some new singers; meanwhile the death of King Frederick put an end to his engagement for the time being. In 1766 he was appointed choir master at the Ospedale della Pietà in Venice, a position he held until 1767. In 1769 he went to London, where he could only survive by giving music lessons. In 1779 he was elected \"maestro di cappella\" at the cathedral of Milan, where he remained until 1784. Here he exercised his true vocation of composer, in addition to at least twenty of his most successful operas, a vast amount of sacred music for the cathedral, and educating a number of clever pupils, the most distinguished of whom was Cherubini. In 1784 Sarti was invited by the empress Catherine II to St. Petersburg. On his way there he stopped in Vienna, where Emperor Joseph II received him with special favour, in large part due to his opera \"Fra i due litiganti il terzo gode\", and where he made the acquaintance of Mozart. He reached St. Petersburg in 1785 and at once took the direction of the opera, for which he composed many new pieces, besides some very striking sacred music, including a \"Te Deum\" for the victory of Ochakov, in which he introduced the firing of real cannons. Sarti founded the Russian Conservatory for Music in 1793. He remained in Russia until 1801, when his health was so broken that he solicited permission to return. The emperor Alexander dismissed him in 1802 with a liberal pension; letters of nobility had been granted to him by empress Catherine. His most successful operas in Russia were \"Armida e Rinaldo\" and \"The Early Reign of Oleg\" (Nachal'noye upravleniye Olega), for the latter of which the empress herself wrote the libretto. Sarti died in Berlin on his return trip.\n\nSarti's opera \"Fra i due litiganti il terzo gode\" has been immortalized by Mozart, who introduced an air from it into the supper scene in \"Don Giovanni\".\n\nSonatas for harpsichord and others instruments (in the Satta's thematic catalog)\n\nSonatas for harpsichord or organ (in the Satta's thematic catalog)\n\n\n\n"}

While many popular songs of the pre-rock period had multiple hit versions — for example, \"Dinah\" had nine Top-Ten covers over the years, and fifteen versions of \"St. Louis Blues\" charted between 1916 and 1953 — according to its co-composer Ray Evans, \"To Each His Own\" is the only song to take up half the slots on the Top Ten at the same time.\n\nEddy Howard reached number one after debuting on the chart with his version of the song on July 11, 1946. Released by Majestic Records as catalog number 7188 and 1070, the single lasted nineteen weeks on the chart, reaching the top spot on August 10 for three weeks and returning for two more weeks on October 5. The two Howard releases had different B sides — \"Cynthia's in Love\" on Majestic 7188 and \"Careless\" on Majestic 1070.\n\nFreddy Martin & his Orchestra, featuring vocals by Stuart Wade, and Tony Martin both had their versions debut on the chart on August 8, 1946, with each remaining on the chart for twelve weeks. While Freddy Martin, whose version was released by RCA Victor Records, was able to top the chart for two weeks, while Tony Martin's version, released by Mercury Records, peaked at number four.\n\nThe next version to reach the \"Billboard\" charts was performed by The Modernaires with Paula Kelly. Released by Columbia Records, together they debuted on the chart on August 15, 1946, lasting fourteen weeks on the chart and peaking at number three.\n\nThe third recording to reach number one was by The Ink Spots, which was released by Decca Records. Reaching the charts on August 29, 1946, it remained on the chart for fourteen weeks, and topped it on September 21.\n\nMargie Rayburn released a version of the song as a single in 1958, but it did not chart.\n\nThe Platters covered \"To Each His Own\" in 1960, their version reaching number 21 (US).\n\nSam Cooke recorded the song for his 1965 LP \"Try a Little Love\". \n\nJerry Vale recorded it for his 1968 LP \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\". \n\nFrankie Laine had a minor revival with the song in 1968, reaching number two on the \"Billboard\" Easy Listening chart. \n\nJohnny Hartman included a version on his 1959 \"And I Thought About You\" album.\n\nKeely Smith recorded it for her 1962 Dot LP, \"Cherokeely Swings\".\n\nRonnie Dove recorded the song for his \"Right or Wrong\" album in 1964.\n\nFrankie Laine's 1968 version reached #82 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100.

A career officer, after joining the Army in 1940 during the Second World War, Dunstan graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon in 1942 and served as an infantry officer, seeing combat against the Japanese during the Bougainville Campaign in 1945. After the war, he served in a variety of appointments, including as commander of the 1st Australian Task Force during the Vietnam War. From 1977 to 1982 he held the appointment of Chief of the General Staff, before retiring from the Army having overseen a large-scale re-organisation. Afterwards, he became the longest-serving governor of South Australia. He died in 2011, at the age of 88.\n\nBorn in Murray Bridge, South Australia, on 18 February 1923, Dunstan joined the Australian Army and was accepted into the Royal Military College, Duntroon in February 1940 amidst the backdrop of the Second World War. A career officer, after graduating from Duntroon in June 1942, having completed a cut-down 18-month version of the normally four-year course, Dunstan was allocated to the infantry and posted to the 27th Battalion, a South Australian Militia unit known as the South Australian Scottish Regiment. He subsequently served with the 27th until the end of the war, except for a brief period when he was seconded to headquarters 23rd Brigade.\n\nWith the 27th Battalion, Dunstan saw combat against the Japanese during the Bougainville Campaign in 1945, and received a Mention in Despatches for his actions while commanding a platoon. After the war, he served as a staff officer in the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan following the war, transferring to the newly established Australian Regular Army in 1947. Upon returning to Australia in 1948, Dunstan married Beryl Dunningham and was posted to Keswick Barracks in Adelaide, South Australia, where he served on the staff of the 4th Military District.\n\nDunstan was then posted to the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) as second-in-command in 1953. He then saw service in Korea including a period as Military Assistant to the Commander in Chief of the British Commonwealth Forces Korea, and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 New Year Honours. Between May 1964 and February 1965, Dunstan commanded 1 RAR, before later holding an appointment at the 1st Recruit Training Battalion. Having reached the rank of colonel, in early 1968 he was deployed to Vietnam as deputy commander of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF). He took over from Brigadier Ron Hughes as Commander of the 1 ATF on 21 May 1968 during the Battle of Coral–Balmoral. For his services during this battle, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1969.\n\nThat year he returned to Australia and on promotion to brigadier took over the 10th Task Force, which was based in New South Wales. He attended the Imperial Defence College in London in 1970 and afterwards he was promoted to major general and appointed Commander of Australian Forces in Vietnam. He remained in the country throughout 1971 and 1972 and oversaw the withdrawal of Australian forces, for which he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, an Officer of the National Order of Vietnam and awarded the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Palm.\n\nHis next appointments were Chief of Materiel in Army Headquarters (1972–74) and General Officer Commanding Field Forces (1974–77). In 1977, having been raised to the rank of lieutenant general, he became Chief of the General Staff (CGS), being extended in that capacity twice before retiring from the Army in 1982. During his time as CGS, Dunstan reorganised the Army around the concept of specialised brigades and worked to improve the readiness of Army units to meet rapidly developing threats. This work later proved pivotal in ensuring the success of the Australian intervention in East Timor in 1999. His service as service chief was recognised by his appointment as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1980.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the Army, Dunstan returned to South Australia, assuming the appointment of Governor of South Australia in April 1982. The longest holder of that appointment, he retired from the role in February 1991. For his work, he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia that same year. He died in Adelaide on 15 October 2011, and was given a state funeral.\n\n\n\n"}

He is presented in contrast with M. Krempe at the same university in that he didn't scorn the study of alchemists.\n\nIn the 1931 film version of \"Frankenstein\", Dr. Waldman (portrayed by Edward Van Sloan) was a professor of anatomical studies at Goldstadt Medical College. Waldman had been Victor Frankenstein's favourite teacher during the aspiring young scientist's time as a student there. Although Waldman had much respect for Henry's brilliance, he became increasingly disturbed when Henry began demanding fresh bodies for his experiments in chemical galvanism and electro-biology: bodies that were \"not\" those of cats and dogs, but human beings. Eventually, the increasingly ambitious Henry left the college to pursue his researches in private. Some time later, Henry's fiancée, Elizabeth, and best friend, Victor Moritz, came to the college to confide in Waldman their fears for Henry's health. After telling them of Henry's decision to leave the school, Waldman agreed to accompany them to Henry's lab to talk some sense into him. Instead, the three bore witness to Henry Frankenstein's crowning achievement: the creation of a creature he had built from parts of dead bodies sewn together, plus a brain that Henry's assistant Fritz had stolen from Waldman's classroom. Waldman tried to tell Henry that the Monster had a defective brain and was dangerous, as Fritz had dropped the chosen brain and brought a criminal one, but this fact only sank in when the monster killed Fritz. They locked up the Monster, and then unlocked the door, injecting him with a sedative in the back which knocked him out after he had nearly killed Frankenstein.\n\nSuffering a nervous breakdown, Henry was taken home by Elizabeth, Victor, and his father, Baron Frankenstein. Waldman remained at the laboratory for the purposes of destroying the Monster by dissection. The Monster awoke before Waldman could begin, however, and, seizing Waldman by the throat, he proceeded to strangle the old man to death.\n\nThe character of Dr. Waldman would later appear in 1932's \"Boo!\", a comedy short made by Universal, in which he is once again strangled to death by the Monster despite the narrator's attempts to warn him.\n\nIn Branagh's film, it is Professor Shmael Augustus Waldman (portrayed by John Cleese) —first and middle name revealed in the comic adaptation of the film—who teaches Victor how to re-animate dead tissue. He previously followed the same path Victor will eventually take, conducting illegal experiments on the human body, only to stop after they brought about \"abomination.\" Waldman and Victor are administering vaccines to the local townspeople. One townsperson (portrayed by Robert De Niro) resists and kills Waldman, resulting in his hanging. Victor uses the killer's body, Waldman's brain, and the leg of a late fellow student named Schiller (portrayed by Hugh Bonneville) who died from Cholera to form the Monster (also portrayed by Robert De Niro).\n\n"}
{"id": "2127720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127720", "title": "Day of Deceit", "text": "Day of Deceit\n\nDay of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor is a book by Robert Stinnett. It alleges that Franklin Roosevelt and his administration deliberately provoked and allowed the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor to bring the United States into World War II. Stinnett argues that the attacking fleet was detected by radio and intelligence intercepts, but the information was deliberately withheld from Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, the commander of the Pacific Fleet at that time.\n\nFirst released in December 1999, it received a nuanced review in \"The New York Times\" and is frequently referenced by proponents of advance knowledge theories.\n\nHistorians of the period, however, generally reject its thesis, pointing to several key errors and reliance on doubtful sources.\n\nStinnett's starting point is a memorandum written by Lieutenant Commander Arthur H. McCollum in October 1940, which was obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. McCollum, then head of the Far East desk of the Office of Naval Intelligence, discussed the strategic situation in the Pacific and ended with a list of eight actions directed at the Japanese threat. Stinnett characterizes the actions as \"provocations\" and states his belief in McCollum's point F (\"Keep the main strength of the U.S. fleet now in the Pacific in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands\") was intended to lure the Japanese into attacking it. Stinnett asserts that the overall intent was to provoke an act of war that would allow Roosevelt to enter into active conflict with Germany in support of the United Kingdom.\n\nWalter Short and Kimmel were ordered to remain in a defensive posture with respect to the Japanese. Stinnett claims that intelligence intercepts were deliberately withheld from them to prevent them from mounting an adequate defense. He also claims that radio traffic was intercepted from the fleet as it approached Hawaii, allowing it to be tracked, but again, the information was withheld so that the defenders would be unprepared. All, says Stinnett, was directed from the White House itself with Roosevelt's knowledge and at his behest.\n\nReviewers were generally dismissive of Stinnett's claims, as many of his claims appear to be baseless. An article in \"Salon\" quotes CIA historian Donald Steury: <nowiki>[Stinnett]</nowiki> concocted this theory pretty much from whole cloth. Those who have been able to check his alleged sources also are unanimous in their condemnation of his methodology. Basically, the author has made up his sources; when he does not make up the source, he lies about what the source says.\n\nCritical points in Stinnett's argument were disputed by military historians. His characterization of the McCollum memorandum was not accepted by Conrad Crane, Chief of Historical Services and Support at the United States Army Heritage and Education Center, who wrote: \"A close reading shows that its recommendations were supposed to deter and contain Japan, while better preparing the United States for a future conflict in the Pacific. There is an offhand remark that an overt Japanese act of war would make it easier to garner public support for actions against Japan, but the document's intent was not to ensure that event happened.\" This means that Stinnett attributes to McCollum a position McCollum expressly refuted. Furthermore, McCollum's own sworn testimony also refutes it.\n\nPhilip Zelikow, writing in \"Foreign Affairs\", objected to Stinnett's claim that the Japanese naval code was being read at the time (the JN-25 code was changed shortly before the attack and was not decrypted again until May 1942), an objection also raised by Crane. A review posted on the U.S. Naval Cryptologic Veterans Association website addresses the intelligence issues in greater detail and disputes claims that the fleet was detected through direction finding; the author also criticizes Stinnett's use of testimony from Robert Ogg, originally identified as \"Seaman Z\" by John Toland in his 1986 book. Indeed, Ogg expressly denies saying what Toland quotes him as saying. In their annotations on the 1995 Pentagon study of the attack, Frederic Borch and Daniel Martinez, chief historian at the USS \"Arizona\" Memorial, also dispute these claims and call his claims \"totally false\".\n\nStinnett's claims of \"intercepts\" are contradicted by Japanese testimony, which unequivocally state there were none, and even transmitter keys were removed from radios of ships in the task force. (The claim of a need for \"low-power radio\" made by Stinnett ignores standard fleet practise under radio silence, use of flag or blinker.) Moreover, his \"intercepts\" do not amount to direction finding bearings, contrary to his claims, while his document allegedly showing the plot of these nonexistent bearings contains nothing of the kind.\n\n\"If there was this vast and humongous conspiracy\", its members had to number in the hundreds. Among them would have to be Lt. Kermit Tyler who, on the morning of 7 December, was contacted about a radar contact on an inbound flight, and told the operators to forget about it. One would also have to include the Navy duty officer, who was asleep when the destroyer USS \"Ward\" first tried to report a minsub contact, thereby losing over three hours' warning. It would also include the officer who ordered USAAC fighters be parked in close proximity to avoid sabotage. Also included would be the senior antiaircraft officers, who ordered ammunition to be locked up far from the guns.\n\nFurthermore, Stinnett makes numerous and contradictory claims of the number of messages originated by the \"Kido Butai\", attributing to it messages from shore stations, Yamamoto's flagship (which was not accompanying the task force), deception measures, and traffic from before the task force even sailed. Moreover, he finds \"not a single one\" originating from the \"Kido Butai\" after it sortied 26 November.\n\nDavid Kahn commented on the book, stating that it had \"basic errors of fact\" and \"tendentious interpretations\" and was \"an extraordinarily sloppy book\". Examples include Stinett commenting on Japanese code wheels which did not exist, and misreading a date that said 15-5-41 as December 5, 1941. Stinnett also mistakenly believed that provoking Japan into an act of war against another nation would trigger the mutual assistance provision of the Axis Tripartite Pact.\n\nHistorian Gordon Prange, in an earlier work, noted that a war between the U.S. and Japan was contrary to Roosevelt's desire to aid Britain in her fight against Germany, and Prime Minister Churchill's desire to avoid \"another war\". Prange, the foremost authority on the Pearl Harbor attack, characterizes the conspiracy theory as \"an absurdity.\" British historian John Keegan writes that Stinnett's charges of conspiracy \"defy logic\", and fail to show how Roosevelt could have succeeded in bringing US Army Chief George Marshall and US Navy Chief Harold Stark into the conspiracy. Another British historian, Ronald Lewin, calls Stinnett's theory \"moonshine.\" Military intelligence historian Roberta Wohlstetter wrote that Stinnett conflated FDR's desire for an incident which might serve as a catalyst for war \"against Germany\", with FDR's supposed foreknowledge of such an incident provoking war with Japan. Presidential historian Joseph E. Persico found that FDR drafted an appeal to peace to the Emperor of Japan the night before the Pearl Harbor attack, which historian Hervie Haughler said could not be the action of someone who wished for war with Japan.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2127731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127731", "title": "Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad", "text": "Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad\n\nPhiladelphia and Columbia Railroad (P&CR) (1834) was one of the earliest commercial railroads in the United States, running from Philadelphia to Columbia, Pennsylvania, it was built by the Pennsylvania Canal Commission in lieu of a canal from Columbia to Philadelphia; in 1857 it became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad. It is currently owned and operated by Amtrak as its electrified Keystone Corridor. The Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad's western terminus was located near the former ferry site known as Wright's Ferry, in the town once of that name, but now Columbia in Lancaster County. There the P&CR met with the Pennsylvania Canal—navigations and improvements on the Susquehanna River east bank approximately south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Most of its right-of-way was obtained by the actions of the Pennsylvania Canal Commission which operated the railroad under the various enabling acts of the Pennsylvania legislature known as the Main Line of Public Works in support of a far sighted plan to link the whole state by canals. With an engineering study reporting back a finding that obtaining sufficient waters to flood the intended 80+ mile canal from Philadelphia to Columbia, the Canal Commission and legislature authorized the railway on the right of way intended for the canal.\nIn 1857 as one of the properties legally denoted as the Main Line of Public Works, with rapidly improving railroad technology driving rapid changes in capabilities, the Railroad was sold along with most of the Pennsylvania Canal system, to the young Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) which acquired properties of the Pennsylvania Canal Commission as far west as Pittsburgh and included the Allegheny Portage Railroad with the proviso that the Railroad had to link Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. At the time, the PRR had begun building its famous Horseshoe Curve cutting across several of the streams forming the gaps of the Allegheny. Hence, the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad became a key integral part of what grew to be the largest railroad in the world.\n\nOriginally planned during the Canal Age at the behest of Philadelphia city fathers to compete with the Erie Canal trade with near-west settlements in the Northwest Territories and expected to be a canal in the late 1820s conception as the easternmost leg of the Pennsylvania Canal System, the branch was to be a continuation of the first funded river improvements and harder-to-construct engineering challenges farther west in less populated rural regions. The canal joining the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers in the initial planning was to run across the most populated expanse of Pennsylvania's Great Valley region (and so was delayed politically in part by local land concerns and the due-process needs of eminent domain). As a canal section, its planning was overtaken by the growth of railroad technology, which by the mid-1830s had demonstrated sufficient promise to adopt the new technology for the easternmost leg of the overall planned transportation system.\nDespite the relatively untried and unproven nature of the railroad technologies with the example of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad project in direct competition—legal capabilities, funding and construction was shifted to a railroad—it was expected to be far faster and cheaper to build above ground and make bridges than it was to dig a deep ditch and provide it with reliable water supplies to enable two way barge traffic.\nThe Pennsylvania Canal was conceived in the mid-1820s by Philadelphia merchants inspired by the obvious impact of the Lehigh Canal and the emerging markets of the three decades of steady emigration into the near west, the Ohio Country and Northwest Territory and other lands of the Louisiana Purchase (1803). Built by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during a time when America's main coastal cities were vying to become the most important and influential port from the mid-1820s, it was an attempt by business interests to position their own port city to be the principal supplier and beneficiary of the economic boom expected from the new markets and resources, all resulting from the great wave of post revolutionary war immigration taking place westwards to the Ohio Country and Northwest Territory regions in the 19th century. It was also a plan to enable the newly opened Coal Region and the initial mines in the Wyoming Valley to provide clean burning Anthracite to eastern cities that were increasingly having trouble finding heating fuels as eastern forests had become scarce and logged over.\n\nBegun with Navigations construction along the Susquehanna and the West Fork of the Susquehanna with surveys for the best route over the barrier of the northern Allegheny Mountains, the system in time ran from Philadelphia on the Delaware estuary westwards across the great plain of southern Pennsylvania (goal of connecting the Susquehanna to New York City via canals) through Harrisburg and across the state to Pittsburgh and connected with other divisions of the Pennsylvania Canal. It consisted of the following principal sections, moving from east to west:\n\n\nThe Pennsylvania Canal opened in 1834 under the Pennsylvania Canal Commission and was sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad on June 25, 1857 for $7,500,000.\n\nThe canals reduced travel time between Philadelphia to Pittsburgh from at least 23 days to just four.\n\nThe Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad began in Philadelphia at Broad and Vine Streets, ran north on Broad and west on Pennsylvania Avenue (a segment later taken over and submerged/tunneled over by the Reading Railroad), then headed northwest across the Columbia Bridge over the Schuylkill River. Just after crossing the river, it traveled up the Belmont Plane, an inclined plane in the current location of West Fairmount Park, and continued west across the eastern part of the state to Columbia, where the Columbia Plane headed down to the Susquehanna River. At that point, the eastern division of the canal was joined to the railroad, allowing transhipment of traffic heading north along the river and then west.\n\nBuilt with public funding, the double-track RR originally operated on a turnpike basis open to all comers, with shippers supplying their own RR cars, horsepower, and drivers (either themselves or their contractors). The RR soon decided also to offer newfangled steam locomotives as an option to haul the cars, interspersed with horse traffic. Horses were banned for through traffic in 1844, and schedules enforced.\n\nIn order to bypass the Belmont Plane, the original Philadelphia & Columbia RR grade between its eastern terminus and Athensville (renamed Ardmore in 1873) was abandoned and replaced in 1850 with a new alignment roughly following the route of the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike (now Lancaster Avenue) and including the existing West Philadelphia Railroad which the state purchased from the railroad's private owners. This realignment is still in use as the four track \"Keystone Corridor\" as far as Ardmore (MP 8.5) and is shared by trains of both Amtrak (it current owner) and SEPTA.\n\nThe Northern Liberties and Penn Township Railroad was incorporated in 1829 to build a branch continuing east on Noble Street and Willow Street to the Delaware River. This shortline opened in 1834.\n\nThe Belmont Plane ran from the Schuylkill River to the top of the Belmont Plateau. The length of the plane was 2,800 feet and its grade 369 feet to the mile, or one foot rise in 14.3 feet, which was a much steeper grade than the planes on the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad which were one foot in 18, making an ascent of 196 feet in 2,800. Steam-driven cables dragged the railway cars to the top of the hill.\n\nOn July 10, 1836, the Philadelphia-based William Norris Locomotive Works 4-2-0 steam engine \"\"George Washington\"\" drove up the Plane making it the first locomotive to climb an ascending grade while pulling a load. The weight of the engine with water was 14,930 pounds and the load drawn up the plane, including the tender with coal and water, two passenger cars, and 53 passengers, was 31,270 pounds. The \"\"Washington's\"\" steam pressure was less than eighty pounds to the square inch, and the time to make the run was 2 minutes, 24 seconds representing a speed of 13.25 mph. The dimensions of the \"Washington\" were: diameter of cylinders, 10 1/4 inches; length of stroke, 17 5/8 inches; number of boiler tubes, 78; outside diameter of tubes, 2 inches; length of tubes, 7 feet; diameter of driving wheels, 4 feet; and diameter of truck wheels, 30 inches. Although the rails at the time of the test were \"wet with dew,\" the locomotive had no rail sander for increasing adhesion of the drivers. So remarkable was this accomplishment that reports in engineering journals doubted its occurrence. Nine days later, the engine repeated the feat in a more formal trial with an even greater load.\n\nIn 1850, the state bought the remnant of the West Philadelphia Railroad, which had been incorporated in 1835 to bypass the Belmont Plane and failed after completing only the section from 52nd Street west to the main line at Ardmore. The state funded and built the rest of the line from 52nd Street east to downtown, but on a different alignment than the one originally planned; the new line, put into operation October 15, 1850, ended at the west end of the Market Street Bridge, from which the City Railroad continued east. The older planned line, was abandoned and became the route of present-day Montgomery Avenue in Lower Merion Township running from the Schuylkill River up the Belmont Plane to Ardmore.\n\nThe Columbia Bridge and line east to Broad and Vine Streets were sold to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad ('The Reading Railroad') as part of its main line. The Reading also acquired the Northern Liberties and Penn Township Railroad in 1870, giving it access to the Delaware River.\n\nThe section of the Pennsylvania Railroad running from Philadelphia west through Chester County and, by extension, the western suburbs of Philadelphia, is still known as the Main Line.\n\nThe Columbia Plane, which lowered railway cars down to the Eastern Division Canal along the Susquehanna River, was bypassed in 1840 by a new track alignment allowed by more modern engines with greater power.\n\n"}

The principal decision-making body in each of the thirty-one local authorities is composed of the members of the council, elected by universal franchise in local elections every five years. Irish Local Authorities are the closest and most accessible form of Government to people in their local community. Many of the authorities' statutory functions are, however, the responsibility of ministerially appointed career officials termed Chief executives. The competencies of the city and county councils include planning, transport infrastructure, sanitary services, public safety (notably fire services) and the provision of public libraries.\n\nLocal government in the state is governed by Local Government Acts 1925 to 2019, the principal act of which is the Local Government Act 2001. The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 is the founding document of the present system. The Twentieth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (1999) provided for constitutional recognition of local government for the first time in Ireland in a new Article 28A. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 changed the structure by the abolition of all town councils and the merger of certain county councils. The reforms came into effect in 2014, to coincide with that year's local elections.\n\nThe county was a unit of judicial and administrative government introduced to Ireland following the Norman invasion. The country was shired in a number of phases with County Wicklow being the last to be shired in 1625. The traditional county of Tipperary was split into two judicial counties (or ridings) following the establishment of assize courts in 1838. Sixty years later, a more radical reorganisation of local government took place with the passage of the Local Government (Ireland) Act (1898). This Act established a county council for each of the thirty-three Irish counties and ridings. The geographic remit of the Irish Free State, which was established pursuant to the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, was confined to twenty-six of the traditional counties of Ireland and thus included 27 administrative counties. To this number may be added the county boroughs. In 1994 Dublin County Council and the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire were abolished with their administrative areas being divided among three new counties: Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin.\n\nThe 2001 Act simplified the local government structure, in which the principal tier of local government (county and city councils) cover the entire territory of the state and have general responsibility for all functions of local government except in 80 towns within the territory of county councils, where the lower tier (town councils) exists with more limited functions. The five county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford, and Limerick were re-styled as city councils under the Act, with the same status in law as county councils. The remaining county boroughs in place at the foundation of the state were downgraded by the 2001 Act to town council status.\n\nIn introducing a second tier of local government, the Act had the effect of:\n\nFrom 1 January 2002 the existing Urban District Councils and boards of Town Commissioners were renamed as Town Councils. Additionally, the city of Kilkenny, along with the four towns of (Sligo, Drogheda, Clonmel, and Wexford) were reduced in status to the level of Town Council. In recognition of the previous history, the towns were permitted to use the title of \"Borough Council\" instead of \"Town Council\". There were 75 other town councils in addition to these five borough councils. \n\nThis structure was a modified version of the system introduced in 1898, with some county boroughs renamed as cities, urban districts and municipal boroughs renamed as town councils (or, as noted, boroughs), and rural districts abolished (everywhere except County Dublin in 1925, and in County Dublin in 1930). The distinction between urban district and \"towns with town commissioners\" had been abolished.\n\nAt various times in the past, other entities at a level below that of the county or county borough have been employed in Ireland for various judicial, administrative and revenue collecting purposes. Some of these, such as the barony and Grand jury, no longer fulfil their original purpose while retaining only vestigial legal relevance in the modern state. Others, such as the Poor Law Unions, have been transformed into entities still in use by the modern state, but again, their original functions have been substantially altered.\n\nOn 28 June 2011, the then-Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government Phil Hogan announced that Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council would be merged into a single local council. The merger came into effect following the 2014 local elections. The new entity would be headed by a directly elected mayor, with a five-year term. The Minister also said that he would not rule out other local council mergers and that the proposal for a directly elected mayor for Dublin was being re-examined.\n\nOn 26 July 2011, the merger of North Tipperary County Council and South Tipperary County Council was announced.\n\nOn 16 October 2012, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government published \"Putting People First\", an \"action plan for effective local government\". The changes for the 2014 local elections were:\n\nThe civic and ceremonial status of existing cities, boroughs and larger towns was retained after being merged with counties. Those municipal districts that included existing cities or boroughs merged became either \"metropolitan districts\" or \"borough districts\". They continue to have mayors as do those districts containing county towns. In all other councils the equivalent office is known as Chair or Cathaoirleach. Each municipal district was issued with a new statutory charter setting out its powers alongside any historic charters that already existed.\n\nOn 6 June 2018, the government announced that Galway City Council and Galway County Council would merge into a single local authority by 2021 at the latest. Under the Local Government Act 2019, a plebiscite was held in Cork City, Limerick City and County, and Waterford City and County on whether to have a directly-elected mayor. It was passed only in Limerick, being rejected in Cork and Waterford.\n\nEurostat, the statistical Directorate-General of the European Union, uses a geographical hierarchy system called the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) for various statistical and financial disbursement purposes. The entirety of Ireland is a First-level NUTS of the European Union. The Second level (NUTS 2) divides the state into three broad areas. The Third level (NUTS 3) splits the Second level into a total of 8 regions. Below this are local administrative units (LAU) which are the basic statistical components for the regions, and in Ireland these are the electoral division (EDs). Electoral divisions have no local government functions, and are used solely for statistical purposes and for defining electoral boundaries.\n\nFollowing the abolition of domestic property rates in the late 1970s, local councils have found it extremely difficult to raise money. The shortfall from the abolition of property rates led to the introduction of service charges for water and refuse, but these were highly unpopular in certain areas and led in certain cases to large-scale non-payment. Arising from a decision made by the Rainbow Government domestic water charges were abolished on 1 January 1997 placing further pressure on local government funding.\n\nThe Department of Finance is a significant source of funding at present, and additional sources are rates on commercial and industrial property, housing rents, service charges and borrowing. The dependence on Exchequer has led to charges that Ireland has an overly centralised system of local government.\n\nIt is worth noting that over the past three decades numerous studies carried out by consultants on behalf of the Government have recommended the reintroduction of some form of local taxation/charging regime, but these were generally seen as politically unacceptable. However, in 2012 the Local Government Management Agency was established to provide a central data management service to enable the collection of the Home Charge, the Non Principle Private Residence (NPPR) charge and the proposed Water charge.\n\nThe most recent report on local government funding, carried out by the Indecon Consortium, is due to be published in the near future.\n\nSince 1999, Motor Tax is paid into the Local Government Fund, established by the Local Government Act 1998 and is distributed on a \"Needs and Resources\" basis.\n\nIn 2013, a local property tax was introduced to provide funding for local authorities.\n\nLocal government has progressively lost control over services to national and regional bodies, particularly since the foundation of the state in 1922. For instance, local control of education has largely been passed to Education and Training Boards, whilst other bodies such as the Department of Education and Skills still hold significant powers. In 1970 local government lost its health remit, which had been already eroded by the creation of the Department of Health in 1947, to the Health Board system. In the 1990s the National Roads Authority took overall authority for national roads projects, supported by local authorities who maintain the non-national roads system. The whole area of waste management has been transformed since the 1990s, with a greater emphasis on environmental protection, recycling infrastructure and higher environmental standards. In 1993 the Environmental Protection Agency was established to underpin a more pro-active and co-ordinated national and local approach to protecting the environment. An Bord Pleanála was seen as another inroad into local government responsibilities. Additionally, the trend has been to remove decision-making from elected councillors to full-time professionals and officials. In particular, every city and county has a manager, who is the chief executive but is also a public servant appointed by the Public Appointments Service (formerly the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission), and is thus answerable to the national government as well as the local council. Therefore, local policy decisions are sometimes heavily influenced by the TDs who represent the local constituency in Dáil Éireann (the main chamber of parliament), and may be dictated by national politics rather than local needs.\n\nLocal government bodies now have responsibility for such matters as planning, local roads, sanitation, and libraries. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has responsibility for local authorities and related services. Fingal County Manager David O'Connor: \"Local Authorities perform both a representational and an operational role because the Irish system of Local Government encompasses both democratic representation and public administration.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Nicknamed \"Dragon in the Clouds\", he ranks fourth among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nThe novel portrays Gongsun Sheng as an eight \"chi\" tall Taoist priest with a noble look as his eyebrows slant apart like the Chinese character for \"eight\" (八) and his eyes are almond-shaped. A native of Jizhou (薊州; present-day Ji County, Tianjin), he is a master of Taoist magic who could summon the wind and rain, ride the mist and drive the clouds. His magical power plus his sometimes mystical behaviour earn him the nickname \"Dragon in the Clouds\". He carries an ancient sword made of copper.\n\nGongsun Sheng learns that Liang Shijie, the prefect of Daming, is sending valuable birthday gifts to his father-in-law Imperial Tutor Cai Jing in the capital Dongjing. He rushes to Yuncheng County to ask Chao Gai, a landlord famed for chivalry, to partner him to rob the convoy. At Chao Gai's manor, he meets Wu Yong, Liu Tang and the three Ruan brothers, who have already come together for the robbery. Following Wu Yong's plan, the seven men, disguised as date traders, trick the escorts of the convoy to drink wine spiked with drug. They cart away the gifts once the guards go numb all over.\n\nThe authorities later determine Chao as the mastermind and send soldiers to arrest the group in his house. Forewarned by Song Jiang, Chao Gai, Wu Yong, Liu Tang and Gongsun Sheng flee to the fishing village of the Ruan brothers. There Gongsun manipulates the elements to confound the soldiers coming for them, who are then mown down by the rest. After that, the seven men flee to Liangshan Marsh to seek refuge.\n\nAt Liangshan, Chao Gai replaces the narrow-minded Wang Lun as chief, who is killed by Lin Chong. Gongsun Sheng takes the third position after Chao Gai and Wu Yong.\n\nAfter some time at Liangshan, Gongsun Sheng misses his mother in Jizhou and decides to go visit her. However, his stay with his mother stretches on as he continues to study Taoism with his master Taoist Luo.\n\nIt happens that the Liangshan outlaws get into a battle with Gaotangzhou (高唐州; around present-day Gaotang County, Shandong) in their attempt to rescue Chai Jin, who is jailed by the prefecture's governor Gao Lian. Although Gao's forces are no match for Liangshan, he uses black magic to conjure wild beasts to defeat them. Distraught, Song Jiang sends Dai Zong to go fetch Gongsun Sheng to take on Gao. Li Kui insists on going along. After they found Gongsun, they could not win Taoist Luo's consent to let his disciple go. Exasperated, Li Kui steals into Taoist Luo's sanctum after nightfall and chops off his head. He is surprised to find the priest still alive the next day. After punishing Li Kui for his rash act, Taoist Luo gives Gongsun Sheng permission to leave, but on the condition that he must return one day to complete his training. Gongsun defeats Gao Lian with his more powerful magic. Gaotangzhou is captured and Chai Jin rescued.\n\nAt Mount Mangdang (芒碭山; north of present-day Yongcheng, Henan), Liangshan faces the challenge of another outlaw band under Fan Rui, who is also trained in Taoist magic. After the force led by Shi Jin was defeated by Fan with his sorcery, Song Jiang comes to give reinforcement. Gongsun Sheng beats Fan Rui and his men with his more powerful magic. Fan surrenders and becomes Gongsun's apprentice.\n\nGongsun Sheng is appointed top strategist of Liangshan alongside Wu Yong after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces on Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. During the expedition against the rebel leader Tian Hu, Gongsun defeats the magician Qiao Daoqing, leading to the fall of Tian.\n\nAfter the Liangshan band put down the rebel forces of Wang Qing, Gongsun convinces Song Jiang to let him return to Jizhou to deepen his study of Taoism. Therefore, he is not involved in the last expedition, which is against the rebel leader Fang La. He spends the rest of his life in Jizhou pursuing the Taoist path.

This includes various Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches. Syriac Christianity consists of two liturgical rites, the East Syriac Rite (also known as the Assyrian Rite, Chaldean Rite or Persian Rite) and the West Syriac Rite (also known as the Antiochian Rite). The main Anaphora of the East Syriac tradition is the Holy Qurbana of Saints Addai and Mari, while that of the West Syriac tradition is the Divine Liturgy of Saint James. \n\nThe churches are primarily based in the Middle East, Africa, and India. The East Syriac Rite is used in the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church based in India, the Chaldean Catholic Church based in Iraq, and in the Assyrian Church of the East based in Iraq (including its archdiocese the Chaldean Syrian Church of India). The Assyrian Church of the East is not in official communion with the Orthodox churches, and they are not a part of the Eastern Catholic churches. \n\nThe West Syriac Rite is used in the Syriac Orthodox Church based in Syria, the Maronite Catholic Church based in Lebanon, the Syriac Catholic Church based in Lebanon, the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church based in India (an archbishopric of the Syriac Orthodox Church), the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church based in India, and the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church based in India. A Reformed variant of the West Syriac Rite is used in the Mar Thoma Syrian Church based in India, but they are not in official communion with Oriental Orthodoxy, and they are not a part of the Eastern Catholic churches.\n\nThe East Syriac word \"Qurbana\" and the West Syriac word \"Qurbono\" are derived from the Aramaic term \"Qurbana\" (ܩܘܪܒܢܐ). When the Temple stood in Jerusalem, and sacrifices were offered, \"Qorban\" was a technical Hebrew term for some of the offerings that were brought there. It comes from a Hebrew root, \"Qarab\", meaning \"to draw close or 'near'\". A required Korban was offered morning and evening daily and on holidays (at certain times, additional 'korbanot' were offered), in addition to which individuals could bring an optional personal Korban.\n\nThe Holy Qurbana is referred to as \"complete\" worship, since it is performed for the benefit of all members of the Church. The other sacraments are celebrated for individual members. Thus the Holy Qurbana is believed to be the sacrament that completes all the others. Hence it is called the \"sacrament of perfection\" or the \"queen of sacraments\".\n\nThe East Syriac or Chaldean rite was associated with the historical Church of the East, centered in the Persian capital of Seleucia-Ctesiphon. Today the Liturgy of Addai and Mari is used in the Ancient Church of the East, the Assyrian Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, as well as the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church and the Chaldean Syrian Church based in Kerala, India.\n\nThe \"Liturgy\" belongs to the East Syriac Rite, the anaphora or \"Eucharistic Prayer\" that is part of this liturgy, possibly dating back to 3rd-century Edessa, even if the outline of the current form can be traced as far back only as the time of the Patriarch Mar Isho-Yab III in the 7th century. This liturgy is traditionally attributed to Saint Addai (disciple of Saint Thomas the Apostle) and Saint Mari (a disciple of Saint Addai). In the form given in the oldest manuscripts, all of the High Middle Ages, this anaphora does not include the Words of Institution, a matter that raised ecumenical concerns.\n\nWest Syriac liturgical rite is developed out of the ancient Antiochene Rite of the Patriarchate of Antioch, adapting the old Greek liturgy into Syriac, the language of the Syrian countryside.\n\nWest Syriac liturgies represent one of the major strains in Syriac Christianity, the other being the East Syriac Rite, the liturgy of the Church of the East and its descendants. Distinct West Syriac liturgies developed following the Council of Chalcedon, which largely divided the Christian community in Antioch into Melkites, who supported the Emperor and the Council and adopted the Byzantine Rite, and the non-Chalcedonians, who rejected the council and developed an independent liturgy – the West Syriac Rite. An independent West Syriac community that grew around the monastery of Saint Maron eventually developed into the Maronite Church. A variant of the West Syriac Rite, the Malankara Rite, developed in the ancient Malankara Church of India and is still used in its descendant churches. They are the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church, and the Malabar Independent Syrian Church.\n\nThe \"Liturgy\" is based on the traditions of the ancient rite of the Early Christian Church of Jerusalem, as the \"Mystagogic Catecheses\" of St Cyril of Jerusalem imply. The \"Liturgy\" is associated with the name of James the Just, the \"brother\" of Jesus and patriarch among the Jewish Christians at Jerusalem. Saint James was martyred at the hands of a mob incensed at his preaching about Jesus and his \"transgression of the Law\" - an accusation made by the Jewish High Priest of the time, Hanan ben Hanan. Among the Eastern liturgies, the \"Liturgy of Saint James\" is one of the Antiochene group of liturgies, those ascribed to Saint James, to Saint Basil, and to Saint John Chrysostom.\n\nThe \"Liturgy of Saint James\" is considered to be the oldest surviving liturgy developed for general use in the Church. Its date of composition is still disputed with some authorities proposing an early date, perhaps ca. AD 60, close to the time of composition of Saint Paul's \"Epistle to the Romans\", while most authorities propose a fourth-century date for the known form, because the anaphora seems to have been developed from an ancient Egyptian form of the Basilean anaphoric family united with the anaphora described in \"The Catechisms\" of St. Cyril of Jerusalem.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2127760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127760", "title": "Harvey Jackins", "text": "Harvey Jackins\n\nCarl Harvey Jackins (June 28, 1916 – 12 July 1999) was the founder, leader and principal theorist of Re-evaluation Counseling (or RC).\n\nJackins was born in Northern Idaho on June 28, 1916.\n\nDuring the 1930s he was a member of the Communist Party of America. Between 1939 and 1941, he organized a Young Communist League at the University of Washington in Seattle. Never completing his undergraduate degree, he became a labor organizer in the 1940s. He was expelled from local 46 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, from the Building Service Employees' Union, and from Lodge 751 of the Aero Mechanics' Union for alleged Communist activities. In 1954 he was brought before the House Un-American Activities Committee as part of its investigation into Communist activities in Pacific Northwest after being named by three witnesses. He took the Fifth Amendment and refused to name former associates.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Jackins became acquainted with L. Ron Hubbard's theory of Dianetics. In 1952 Jackins formed Personal Counselors Inc. to \"engage in, conduct and teach the art and science of Dianetics.\" While practicing Dianetics, he developed the concepts of \"re-evaluation\" and \"discharge\" and came to believe that they could be encouraged by the \"exchange of aware attention\" in the \"co-counseling process\". At this time, Jackins used some of the terminology of Dianetics, such as \"clearing up patterns\", \"rationality\", \"present time\" and \"passing distress by contagion\". Psychiatrist Richard M. Childs claimed that Jackins' book \"The Human Side of Human Beings\" (1965) plagiarized Hubbard's \"Dianetics\" (1950), saying that Jackins \"paraphrased Hubbard's terms by recasting them in his own jargon. Hubbard's 'Engrams' became Jackins' 'distress patterns', 'release' became 'discharge', and 'to become clear' became RC's 'to re-emerge'.\" In 1957, Hubbard's Scientology organisation claimed that Jackins was describing himself as a \"Dianetics Auditor\". \n\nDuring the late 1950s and early 1960s, Jackins systematized his views and in the 1960s and 1970s took RC from Seattle, where he first practised it, to the rest of the US and to Europe. From 1975 to 1990, he appointed local teachers, area representatives, regional leaders and representatives of groups such as blacks and gays. He wrote RC's Guidelines and decided on all major issues. His policies were ratified by a biennial conference. Tourish and Irving compared his system of management to the Communist state model of democratic centralism. Jackins is said to have claimed that several governments were influenced by RC and to have thought that eventually religion will be replaced by Re-evaluation Counseling.\n\nHarvey Jackins' own story of the origins of Re-evaluation Counseling leaves out any mention of Dianetics. As he told it, he began to develop Re-evaluation Co-Counseling after observing a troubled friend make changes in his thinking process through being patiently listened to while he cried. Curious about the effect of this crying, he worked with others to develop a method of reciprocal counseling based on the recollection of psychological and physical traumas or \"hurts\" accompanied by various types of emotional catharsis. He called these effects \"discharge\" (as in the discharge of a battery), which he came to believe led to clear thinking or \"re-evaluation\". He held that rational thinking was prevented by the accumulation of past hurts, which could be removed by repeated discharge through co-counseling. The objective of RC became the dissemination of this method of creating rational thinking, a process called \"re-emergence\". Re-evaluation counseling, it is held, can remove \"oppression\", which it considers to lie at the root of most of the problems in the world.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Jackins was criticized within RC for his views that homosexuality may be a form of \"distress\" arising from the mistreatment of young children, and that it may be \"recovered\" or removed. In a 1974 article entitled \"Is Homosexuality a Distress Pattern?\", Jackins said that homosexuality, \"as distinct from the desire to touch or be close, is irrational, is the result of distress patterns (often very early in origin and chronic), and will disappear by the free choice of the individual with sufficient discharge and re-evaluation.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, RC members began to accuse Jackins of sexual misconduct, which was said to range from favoring attractive young women in the organization to rape. The first allegation of sexual abuse was made in 1981 by RC member Deborah Curren. Her claims were reported in the \"Seattle Sun\" and on a local TV station, KIRO TV. Following the allegations, Jackins was strongly criticized by the Minneapolis-St Paul RC group. Jackins disbanded the group and forty-five members of RC resigned in protest. Jackins wrote that \"The use of these rumors to attack me and through me the Community has been a very nasty problem in the last few months, and there is some indication that some of the spook agencies of the government and their dirty tricks department have been involved in this.\" Curren took out a lawsuit against Jackins but withdrew it when Jackins filed for costs. \n\nIn 1989 a group of RC leaders, led by Daniel le Bon, resigned from RC, stating in their resignation letter that RC had no scientific basis. They said that Jackins made improbable claims, took a dogmatic stance and ignored evidence. They said that Jackins had extended the purpose of RC from discharge to \"general liberation from all oppressions\" because there was no discharge and Jackins knew it. Le Bon subsequently created his own organisation, \"Présence à soi\", which was similar to RC in some respects.\nJackins said that suggestions were welcome within the organisation but advised followers to ignore criticisms of RC leaders, which he dismissed as \"attacks\".

RC says that \"People playing this role should not be 'counseled' but should be asked to apologize and, if unresponsive, should be made to leave the group and their attacks ignored.\" \"To counter attacks on RC and its leaders, RC members are instructed to interrupt the person, approach the accusation as the personal problem of the accuser, and vigorously come to the defense of the person or people being attacked.\" In 1981, when allegations of sexual misconduct began to emerge, the World Conference of the Re-evaluation Counseling Communities resolved unanimously to \"reject and condemn, as completely contradictory to the spirit and practice of Re-evaluation Counseling, the vicious gossip and slanderous circulation of written attacks upon Harvey Jackins.\"\n\nJackins had two sons.

{"id": "2127772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127772", "title": "Marietta Holley", "text": "Marietta Holley\n\nMarietta Holley (pen names, Jemyma, later, Josiah Allen's Wife; July 16, 1836 – March 1, 1926), was an American humorist who used satire to comment on U.S. society and politics. Holley enjoyed a prolific writing career and was a bestselling author in the late 19th century, though she was largely forgotten by the time of her death. Her writing was frequently compared to that of Mark Twain and Edgar Nye. Along with Frances Miriam Whitcher and Ann S. Stephens, Holley is remembered as one of America's most significant early female humorists. Holley's work appealed to all classes of society. Her readers are scattered over the entire world and include men and women of every station and grade. Her books are widely read in Europe.\n\nHolley was born in a modest cottage in Ellisburg, New York, on the outskirts of Adams, New York, July 16, 1836. She was the youngest of Mary Tabor and John Milton Holley's seven children. The family lived on a small farm in Jefferson County, New York, on the road leading from Adams to Pierrepont Manor. The Holleys went to Jefferson county from Connecticut. Her maternal grandfather, \"Old Squire Taber\" as he was called, went to Pierrepont Manor from Rhode Island.\n\nShe received the rudiments of an English education at a neighboring school, and later, with the exception of teachers in music and French, she pursued her studies at home. At fourteen, she ended her formal education in order to supplement the family income by giving piano lessons. When she was a young girl she was given to poetry, and wrote a great deal. She thought she should like to become a great painter; then she decided to be a poet, but finally abandoned both intentions. Holley commenced her career as a writer when in her teens, though she published nothing until 1876.\n\nAt the age of seventeen, she converted to the Baptist faith and joined the Adams Village Baptist Church. Her father died when she was 25, and Holley took charge of the farm and care of her sick mother and sister.\n\nHer first appearance in print was in a newspaper published in the \"Adams Journal\". Her first pen-name was \"Jemyma.\" The editor of that paper encouraged the young aspirant with some timely praise, as did Charles J. Peterson, for whom she wrote later. The editors of the \"Christian Union\" published what they called \"a sweet little poem \" from her pen. She wrote also for the \"Independent\" and several other weekly and monthly journals. Her articles at that time were mostly poems, and were widely copied in the United States and in Europe.\n\nIt was in a dialect sketch written for \"Peterson's Magazine\" that she first adopted the pen-name \"Josiah Allen's Wife\". That pen name and \"Jemyma\" were a protest against the too musical pen-names of literary aspirants. Those articles attracted the attention of Elijah Bliss, president of the American Publishing Company, of Hartford, Connecticut. Against the protest of his company, he brought out Holley's work. He urged her to write a book for him, which she did, and it was an immediate success, and was republished at once in England and Canada. The name of that book was \"My Opinions and Betsy Bobbet's\" (Hartford, 1872).\n\nHer next book, \"Samantha at the Centennial\", appeared in 1877, and at once pleased the popular taste. \"The Wayward Pardner\" appeared in 1880. \"Miss Richard's Boy\", a book of stories not in dialect, was published in 1882. These books were brought out by the American Publishing Company, and the same firm published an illustrated poem of hers called \"The Mormon Wife\". Holley's follow-up prose work, \"Sweet Cicely\", (New York, 1885) was wrought out through her horror of intemperance and her desire to see the young of her country saved from the evils of strong drink. This was followed by \"Samantha at Saratoga\" (Philadelphia, 1887). \"Poems\" (New York, 1887), revealed strength and tenderness, but failed to suit the popular taste because they were wanting in the grotesque humor and pathetic homeliness of style which characterized her prose works. \"Samantha Amongst the Brethern\", appeared in 1891.\n\nAfter Holley became a successful novelist, she built a mansion called \"Bonnie View\" near her family's home in Pierrepont. \nShe wrote over 25 books, including one collection of poems, two dramas and one long poem, between 1873 and 1914. Among her novels was a 10-book series that detailed the travels and married life of Samantha and Josiah Allen as they journey outside Samantha's rural hometown, which was similar to Holley's own. Holley herself spent most of her life close to her family's farm; aside from Saratoga and Coney Island, she never actually visited the places to which she sent her fictional protagonists; she instead depended on maps, guidebooks, and descriptions for the necessary details.\n\nHer books were translated into other languages and brought her a comfortable income. Many contemporary writers and suffragists held her in high regard; her famous friends included Susan B. Anthony, Twain, and Clara Barton. Anthony frequently asked Holley to give speeches at suffrage conventions because of Holley's support of women's suffrage, but she refused public appearances.\n\nMany of Holley's writings share themes of prohibition and women's rights. Like Charles Dickens, she brought to her aid the very people whose sufferings she aimed to relieve, and whose evil deeds she hoped to check. She was not only quaint in expression but magnetic, and her sentiments were often touchingly and pathetically strong.\n\nQuaint, grotesque humor and pathetic homeliness of speech were the weapons she used to make known the wrongs of her sex and the evils of the times. In her prose work, she mostly employed the speech of half-taught people, writing of their ludicrous blunders, and turning ridicule against ancient wrongs, venerated because they are ancient. Every one laughs at the absurdities of \"Josiah Allen's Wife\", and no one forgets the crushing exposures of fraud and oppression which she makes.\n\nHolley never married. A maiden sister resided with her. Holley died March 1, 1926, at age 89.\n\n\n\n�"}

The main industry is in forestry products, with teak and other hardwoods extracted from the mountains. The city is known for its areca palms, to the extent that a Burmese proverb for unexpected good fortune is equated to a \"betel lover winning a trip to Taungoo\".\n\nThe city is famous in Burmese history for the Toungoo dynasty which ruled the country for over 200 years between the 16th and 18th centuries. Taungoo was the capital of Burma in 1510–1539 and 1551–1552.\n\nKaytumadi new city (new city of Taungoo) is the central command of the southern command division region of Armed Forces (\"Tatmadaw\"). Hanthawaddy United Football Club is based in Taungoo.\n\nThe classical Pali name of Taungoo is Ketumadi (ကေတုမဒီ;), which translates to \"possessed of the royal standard.\"\n\nTaungoo was founded in 1279 in the waning days of Pagan as part of frontier expansion southwards. After the fall of Pagan Empire in 1287, Taungoo came under the rule of Myinsaing Kingdom and later Pinya Kingdom. In 1358, Taungoo successfully revolted and became independent until 1367 when it became a nominal part of the Ava Kingdom. Its rulers retained a large degree of autonomy, playing larger Ava and Hanthawaddy kingdoms against each other. In 1470, Ava put down another rebellion and made Sithu Kyawhtin, the general who defeated the rebellion, governor. Sithu Kyawhtin's grandson Mingyi Nyo became governor of Taungoo in 1485. Under Mingyi Nyo's leadership, the principality grew powerful. In October 1510, Mingyi Nyo formally broke away from Ava and founded the Taungoo Kingdom.\n\nMingyi Nyo's successors Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung went on to found the largest empire in the history of south-east Asia. Taungoo's stint as capital was short-lived, however. Tabinshwehti moved the kingdom's capital to Pegu (Bago) in 1539. The city briefly again became capital of a rebellion in 1599 when viceroy Minye Thihathu II of Taungoo declared himself king. In December 1599, Taungoo's forces in collaboration with the Arakanese armies aided by Portuguese mercenaries, sacked Pegu. The rebellious city state remained independent for another 10 years when Natshinnaung ascended the Taungoo throne in 1609. In the following year, King Anaukpetlun captured Taungoo and ended the city's long line of rulers. Although few visible historic remains survive, all four sides of the brick city wall remain from the dynastic period, with the exception of the part of the southern wall. The 9.6 m wide moat has largely dried up, except for a section on the eastern side, which is still maintained.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, Taungoo was governed by a local governor appointed by the Konbaung kings. The Taungoo District consisted of 52 wards, including today's Pyinmana (and Naypyidaw) regions. The district was cut in half after the Second Anglo-Burmese War. The British annexed the southern half, including the city of Taungoo while the northern portion, including Pyinmana and Ela, remained under Burmese control.\n\nIn 1940, the British Royal Air Force built an airfield north of the town, which from August 1941 through February 1942 served as a training and support base for the 1st American Volunteer Group, popularly known as the Flying Tigers.\n\nTaungoo celebrated its 500th birthday on 16 October 2010, by reconstructing and renovating many city attractions.\n\nTaungoo has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification \"Aw\") bordering on a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification \"Am\"). Temperatures are hot throughout the year, and the months before the monsoon (March–May) are especially hot with average maximum temperatures exceeding . There is a winter dry season (November–March) and a summer wet season (April–October).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe population of Taungoo in the 2014 census was 108,569; in the 1983 census it was 65,851.\n\nThe Bamar (Burmans) make up the majority with a significant Kayin (Karen) population on the eastern side of the city. The Chinese, Indians, Shan and Kayah people make up the rest.\n\nThe majority of residents are Theravada Buddhists, followed by Baptist and Roman Catholic Christians. Taungoo is home to a number of Karen Christian association headquarters and churches. See list of churches.\n\nThe main transport options to Taungoo is rail and motorways.\n\nThe Taungoo railway station is on the main north line of Myanmar Railways, and the Taungoo Highway bus station is served by domestic bus lines.\n\nIntra-city transport is mainly through a circular railway line which serves around the Taungoo District and bus lines, which serve downtown, and suburban areas: \n\n\nThere are two main road bridges: over the Sittaung River and the Kaphaung River.\n\nTaungoo Airport is the area's only airport and is a military-only air base of Myanmar Air Force. MAF's No.47 Helicopter Squadron is stationed at the airport.\n\nTaungoo has eleven high schools: see \"List of high schools in Taungoo\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2127780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127780", "title": "Varroa jacobsoni", "text": "Varroa jacobsoni\n\nVarroa jacobsoni is a species of mite that parasitises \"Apis cerana\" (Asian honey bees). The more damaging \"Varroa destructor\" was previously included under the name \"V. jacobsoni\", but the two species can be separated on the basis of the DNA sequence of the cytochrome oxidase I gene in the mitochondrial DNA.\n\nPrior to recent studies, \"V. jacobsoni\" was considered homogeneous; however, current research has detected genetic variance among populations by using genetic markers. This finding has led to the belief that \"V. jacobsoni\" was introduced to the Americas multiple times. The hosts switching between the eastern \"A. cerana\" and the western \"A. mellifera\" is the major factor that broadens the pathological transmission of \"V. jacobsoni\". It has spread worldwide with the exception of Australia and central Africa.\n\nAt least 30 lineages of mites have specialised in living with bees. Most mite species associated with bee nests are either saprophagous or cleptophagous. Saprophagous mites eat hive debris, especially parts with fungi growth. Cleptophagous mites eat pollen and other nutrients stored by bees. The few that have evolved to become parasitic appear to have arisen from predatory lineages. The family Laelapidae has 12 genera that prey on stingless bees (Meliponinae). Thus, the brood parasites (Varroidae) of honeybees (Apinae) appear to have evolved from the Laelapidae.\n\nThe lifecycle of \"V. jacobsoni\" in \"A. cerana\" begins with a mature mated female entering a larval cell of a honey bee. Once the cell is capped, the adult female mite hides for five days inside the larval food near the bottom of the cell. After about five hours, the mite is released from the food, where it then begins feeding on the host's haemolymph. After 60 hours, the adult female mite lays its first egg on the wall of the cell. Unfertilised mite eggs produce male offspring, that are able to mate with the female offspring. The adult mated female then emerges from the cell with the emerging bee. Once mites are released to the environment, they are transferred to other bees through close contact. The adult female mites then feed through the intersegmental membrane on honeybee haemolymph. The cycle is then completed.\n\nAcaricides are pesticides that kill members of the Acari group, which includes ticks and mites. Acaricides were at one time an effective method in regulating the transmission of \"V. jacobsoni\" in honey bees, but the buildup of residues in acaricide-resistant strains have decreased the effectiveness of mite control in honey bees. Among those acaricides used are acrinathrin, amitraz, bromopropylate, chlordimeform, coumaphos, flumethrin, and fluvalinate. Fluvalinate is the most effective acaricide.\n"}

Penn Presbyterian is spread out on a campus bounded by Market Street, Powelton Avenue, 38th Street, and Sloan Street.\n\nPresbyterian was founded in 1871 by the Alliance of Philadelphia Presbyteries as a 45-bed facility on . The Reverend Dr. Ephraim D. Saunders, a Presbyterian minister, dedicated the land in memory of his son Courtland, who was shot and killed in service on September 21, 1862, in a battle during the Civil War. Reverend Saunders said at the dedication, \"A few days before the battle of Antietam... he [Courtland] passed with me from his tent in the forest... In view of the perils of war... he recommended that in the case of his death... the property should all be donated to some prominent... charity.\" The incorporators declared the purpose was \"to provide medical and surgical aid and nursing for the sick and disabled...\" Care and nursing was granted to the indigent of Philadelphia, funded by donations from individuals and Presbyterian churches, to fulfill its Christian mission. This commitment was renewed in 1952, when the trustees of the Hospital voted against moving to the more affluent suburbs, choosing to remain in West Philadelphia. The original name was \"Presbyterian Hospital of Philadelphia.\" It has since grown into a 300-bed institution on with various nationally recognized medical institutes, specialty centers and research programs.\n\nPresbyterian's School of Nursing, founded in 1887, has a long history of imbuing the medical center with an increased awareness and importance placed on the value on nursing in the treatment of patients. As a result, nurses at Presbyterian are recognized by the medical center for improving the quality of care it strives to provide.\n\nThe Hospital remained independent but formally affiliated with Penn in 1965, changing its name to Presbyterian–University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. It was renamed the Presbyterian Medical Center of Philadelphia in 1989.\n\nBy the mid 1990s, senior management at Presbyterian Hospital realized due to increasing costs and shrinking revenues, an independent hospital the size of Presbyterian might not survive. In 1995, Presbyterian Medical Center, as it was then known, joined the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS). This has provided them access to and benefits from the resources of the Health System, as well as the University's School of Medicine. The name was changed to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center.\n\nThe Philadelphia Heart Institute was the region's first outpatient pulmonary care facility.

Doris Day introduced it in the Alfred Hitchcock film \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" (1956), singing it as a cue to their onscreen kidnapped son. The four verses of the song progress through the life of the narrator—from childhood, through young adulthood and falling in love, to parenthood—and each asks \"What will I be?\" or \"What lies ahead?\" The chorus repeats the answer: \"What will be, will be.\"\n\nDay's recording of the song for Columbia Records made it to number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number one in the UK Singles Chart. It came to be known as Day's signature song. The song in \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" received the 1956 Academy Award for Best Original Song. It was the third Oscar in this category for Livingston and Evans, who previously won in 1948 and 1950. In 2004 it finished at number 48 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.\n\nIt was a number-one hit in Australia for pop singer Normie Rowe in September 1965.\n\nThe song popularized the title expression \"que sera, sera\" as an English-language phrase indicating \"cheerful fatalism\", though its use in English dates back to at least the 16th century. Contrary to popular perception, the phrase is not Spanish in origin, and is ungrammatical in that language.\n\nThe popularity of the song has led to curiosity about the origins of the title saying, \"que sera, sera\", and the identity of its language. Both the Spanish-like spelling used by Livingston and Evans and an Italian-like form (\"che sarà sarà\") are first documented in the 16th century as an English heraldic motto. The \"Spanish\" form appears on a brass plaque in the Church of St. Nicholas, Thames Ditton, Surrey, dated 1559. The \"Italian\" form was first adopted as a family motto by either John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, or his son, Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford. It is said by some sources to have been adopted by the elder Russell after his experience at the Battle of Pavia (1525), and to be engraved on his tomb (1555 N.S.). The 2nd Earl's adoption of the motto is commemorated in a manuscript dated 1582. Their successors—Earls and, later, Dukes of Bedford (\"Sixth Creation\"), as well as other aristocratic families—continued to use the motto. Soon after its adoption as a heraldic motto, it appeared in Christopher Marlowe's play \"Doctor Faustus\" (written ca. 1590; published 1604), whose text (Act 1, Scene 1) contains a line with the archaic Italian spelling \"Che sera, sera / What will be, shall be\". Early in the 17th century the saying begins to appear in the speech and thoughts of fictional characters as a spontaneous expression of a fatalistic attitude.\n\nThe saying is always in an English-speaking context, and has no history in Spain, Portugal, Italy, or France, and in fact is ungrammatical in all four Romance languages. It is composed of Spanish or Italian words superimposed on English syntax. It was evidently formed by a word-for-word mistranslation of English \"What will be will be\", merging the free relative pronoun \"what\" (= \"that which\") with the interrogative \"what?\"\n\nLivingston and Evans had some knowledge of Spanish, and early in their career they worked together as musicians on cruise ships to the Caribbean and South America. Composer Jay Livingston had seen the 1954 Hollywood film \"The Barefoot Contessa\", in which a fictional Italian family has the motto \"Che sarà sarà\" carved in stone at their ancestral mansion. He immediately wrote it down as a possible song title, and he and lyricist Ray Evans later gave it a Spanish spelling \"because there are so many Spanish-speaking people in the world\".\n\nIn modern times, thanks to the popularity of the song and its many translations, the phrase has been adopted in countries around the world to name a variety of entities, including books, movies, restaurants, vacation rentals, airplanes, and race horses.\n\nThe song originally appeared in Alfred Hitchcock film \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\", where it appears diegetically and serves an important role in the film's plot. In the film, Day plays a retired popular singer, Jo McKenna, who, along with her husband (played by Jimmy Stewart) and son, becomes embroiled in a plot to assassinate a foreign prime minister. After foiling the assassination attempt, Jo and her husband are invited by the prime minister to the embassy, where they believe their young son is being held by the conspirators. Jo sits at a piano and plays \"Que Sera, Sera\", singing loudly in the hope of reaching her son. Upon hearing his mother play the familiar song, Jo's son whistles along, allowing Jo's husband to find and rescue the boy, just before he was to be murdered by the conspirators to the assassination attempt.\n\n\"Que Sera Sera\" came to be considered Doris Day's signature song, and she went on to sing it in later films and TV appearances. In 1960's \"Please Don't Eat the Daisies\", she sings a snippet of the song to her co-star, David Niven, who plays her husband. In the 1966 film \"The Glass Bottom Boat\" she sings a snippet accompanied by Arthur Godfrey on ukulele. From 1968 to 1973, it was the theme song for the sitcom \"The Doris Day Show\".\n\nVersions of the song have appeared on a number of film and television soundtracks, often juxtaposed with dark or disastrous events to create an effect of black comedy. For example, in \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Bart's Comet\", the song is sung by the citizens of Springfield in anticipation of an impending comet strike that will wipe out the town and kill them all. Previously, the song was featured over the opening and the ending credits of \"Heathers\", a dark teen comedy dealing with murder and suicide. The version over the opening credits is performed by Syd Straw and the version over the ending credits is performed by Sly and the Family Stone.\n\n\"Que Sera, Sera\" has been adapted as a popular celebratory football chant in England, typically with the lyrics:\n<poem>\nQue sera sera,\nWhatever will be will be,\nWe're going to Wembley,\nQue sera sera\n</poem>\nThis would be sung by fans following a victory that progresses their favoured team to the next round of a competition that will ultimately lead them to Wembley Stadium (typically the FA Cup, the finals of which have been held in Wembley since 1923). Variations have been reported substituting other venues, such as \"We're going to Germany\", in reference to a team qualifying for the 2006 World Cup.\n\nAustralian pop singer Normie Rowe's 1965 recording of \"Que Sera, Sera\", which was produced by Pat Aulton on the Sunshine Record label (Sunshine QK 1103), was the biggest hit of his career, \"the biggest Australian rock 'n roll hit of 1965\", and is reputed to be the biggest-selling Australian single of the 1960s. The song was \"done in the style of \"Louie, Louie\" and the manner of \"Hang On Sloopy\", and given a \"Merseybeat\" treatment (in the manner of The Beatles' \"Twist & Shout\"), and was backed by Rowe's band The Playboys. It was paired with a powerful version of the Johnny Kidd & The Pirates' classic \"Shakin' All Over\", and the single became a double-sided No. 1 hit in most capitals (#1 Sydney, #1 Melbourne, #1 Brisbane, #1 Adelaide, and Perth). in September 1965, charting for 28 weeks and selling in unprecedented numbers, with Rock historian Ian McFarlane reporting sales of 80,000 copies, while 1970s encyclopedist Noel McGrath claimed sales of 100,000. Rowe scored another first in October 1965 when \"Que Sera Sera\" became his third hit single in the Melbourne Top 40 simultaneously. In 1965 Rowe received a gold record for \"Que Sera, Sera\" at Sydney's prestigious Chevron Hotel. In December 1965 the master of Rowe's version was purchased by Jay-Gee Records for release in the United States. In April 1966 Rowe received a second gold record for the sales of \"Que Sera, Sera\". In August 1966 Rowe won Radio 5KA's annual best male vocal award for \"Que Sera, Sera\". In 2006 Rowe released a newly recorded version, which was released by ABC via iTunes, and later adding \"the whole digital mix with a radio mix and a dance mix\".\n\nIn the decades since the song's original release, \"Que Sera, Sera\" has been covered by dozens of artists. A 1970 cover sung by Mary Hopkin and produced by Mickie Most reached #77 on the Billboard Hot 100, and #7 on the Adult Contemporary chart. A 1982 cover by Shakin' Stevens from his album \"Give Me Your Heart Tonight\" reached #2 on the UK charts.\n\nSly & the Family Stone covered the song on their 1973 album \"Fresh\", in a radically slowed-down and soulful version. \n\nIn 1966 Geno Washington & the Ram Jam Band had a minor hit with it when it got to #43.\n\nAs a result of the song's immediate popularity following the release of \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\", versions were soon written in other languages. An early example was a by Jo Leemans which reached the Belgian charts in December 1956. Versions of the song have also been recorded in Danish, French, Mandarin, Spanish, Japanese, and Swedish, among other languages. These in turn have led some non-English speakers to adopt the saying \"que sera, sera\".\n\nThe song's lyrics have been referenced or modified in other compositions, such as the 1978 song \"Baby Hold On\" by Eddie Money, which features the modified refrain \"Whatever will be, will be/The future \"is\" ours to see\".\n\nIn 2016 Fairuz recorded a cover of the song in Lebanese Arabic entitled « Lbaddu Yseer Biyseer » ( Lebanese Arabic For Whatever Will Be Will Be ) at Angel Studios in London, with Lyrics adapted in Lebanese Arabic by Fairuz daughter photographer and producer Reema Rahbany, and arrangements by English musician and arranger Steve Sidwell. The cover song was meant to be part of Fairuz last album Bebalee, but was eventually not included. As Fairuz daughter Reema Rahbany explained later on, copyright authorisation of the use of a cover of the original song was not granted until too late/after the due release of Fairuz Bebalee album on 22 September 2017, and was thus excluded from the album as it was initially intended to be the album's 6 track. The cover song was eventually released in April/May 2018 by Fairuz daughter Reema Rahbany as a present and tribute for her mother Fairuz on Mother Day in Lebanon, stating that Que Sera Sera was one of Fairuz most loved songs, and that Fairuz loved Arabic versions of western cover songs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2127805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127805", "title": "Deron Williams", "text": "Deron Williams\n\nDeron Michael Williams ( ; born June 26, 1984) is an American retired professional basketball player. He played college basketball for the Illinois Fighting Illini before being drafted third overall in the 2005 NBA draft by the Utah Jazz. The three-time NBA All-Star has also played for Beşiktaş of the Turkish Basketball League during the 2011 NBA lockout, and was a gold medal winner on the United States national team at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\nWilliams was born in Parkersburg, West Virginia. In elementary school and middle school, Williams won two state wrestling championships. In 1993, as an eight-year-old, he won the 67 lb. weight class Texas State championship. Four years later in 1997, he won the twelve-year-old 116 lb. weight class championship. Williams attended The Colony High School in The Colony, Texas and averaged 17 points, 9.4 assists, and 2 steals per game as a junior in 2001. That year he led his team, the Cougars, to a 32–2 record and the Class 5A state semifinals against Bryan High. In 2002, as a senior, he averaged 17.6 points, 8.5 assists, 6.1 rebounds, and 2.6 steals per game. His team, the Cougars, went 29–2 that season, losing the 5A Texas State semifinals. Williams was a teammate of Bracey Wright who went on to play for Big Ten rival Indiana University.\n\nWilliams was recruited to play college basketball at the University of Illinois for the 2002–03 NCAA season by Bill Self. In his freshman year, he started 30 of 32 games and ranked third in the Big Ten Conference in assists with 4.53 per game.\n\nBruce Weber assumed the head coach position for the Illini in April 2003 and helped develop Williams throughout his remaining collegiate career. As a sophomore, Williams improved his scoring average from 6.3 to 14.0 points per game and improved his assists per game from the prior year to 6.17. Williams was a First-Team All-Big Ten selection by both the coaches and media.\n\nIn 2005, as a junior starting point guard, Williams led the Fighting Illini to the NCAA championship game where they lost to the University of North Carolina. That season saw the Illini go undefeated until the final game of the regular season, when they lost to Ohio State by one point. Illinois's road to the Final Four was marked by a comeback win over the Arizona Wildcats, where the Illini, led by Williams, came back from fifteen points down in the final minutes to win the game. Williams made the game-tying three-point shot with just 38.5 seconds left in regulation. He then hit the go-ahead three-pointer in overtime, and the Illini never looked back in that game.\n\nWilliams received many awards after the 2004–05 season. Those honors include being named a consensus Second Team All American, as well as being named First Team All-Big Ten, Big Ten All-Tournament Team, and All-Final Four team and at the conclusion of the academic year, Williams was named as the University of Illinois Athlete of the Year. Williams was also a finalist for the Wooden Award and was named Most Outstanding Player of the Chicago Regional in the NCAA Tournament. Williams was named First-Team All-Big Ten as a sophomore in 2004 and as a junior in 2005, the year in which Williams, called by coach Bruce Weber \"the MVP of the team\", led the Illini to the Final Four. The team included four other future NBA players, including Dee Brown, Roger Powell, James Augustine, and Luther Head.\n\nWilliams declared for the NBA draft after the 2005 season, forgoing his final year of collegiate eligibility.\n\nFollowing the season, Williams declared for the 2005 NBA draft. The Utah Jazz selected Williams with the third overall selection, after Andrew Bogut and Marvin Williams. He started the season coming off the bench, eventually moved into the role of starting point guard, and was later sent back to the bench. Williams finished his rookie season averaging 10.8 points and 4.5 assists per game, in 80 games played. Williams was rewarded by being named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team, as well as being the only other rookie besides Chris Paul to receive a first-place vote in the 2005–06 NBA Rookie of the Year voting (Williams received one first-place vote, from Jazz color commentator Ron Boone). Williams and Chris Paul have shared a friendly rivalry that began after the 2005 NBA draft, where Williams and Paul were the third and fourth selections overall. Whether Williams or Paul was the superior point guard is the subject of frequent debate among sports writers and fans.\n\nWilliams began the 2006–07 season as the starting point guard for the Jazz. The Jazz started the season with a 12–1 record. This record was the best in team history and in the league. During these first 13 games of the season Williams played remarkably well, delivering five double-doubles. Two of these double-doubles were back-to-back performances of 26/14 and 27/15 (points/assists). Both of these assists totals bested his previous career high. In the second of those two games, he also had a career high in steals, with five. On January 17, 2007, in a game against the Detroit Pistons, he recorded a career high 31 points. A few days later, on January 24, he recorded a career high 21 assists in a game against the Memphis Grizzlies. In his second season, his numbers improved in almost all categories, increasing to 16.2 points and 9.3 assists per game (second only to Steve Nash in the NBA). The Jazz improved to post a 51–31 record, winning the Northwest Division title.\n\nThe playoffs ended a three-year playoff drought for the Jazz, and in the first round, they faced the Houston Rockets. Williams scored in double figures in each of the seven games in the series, including a 14 assist, 20 point double-double on May 5 to close out the series. The Jazz won the series 4–3, beating the Rockets in Houston to complete the series. It was their first playoff series victory since 2000.\n\nIn the second round, Williams and the Jazz faced the Golden State Warriors, the eighth-seeded team that had upset the top seeded Dallas Mavericks 4–2 in the first round. Williams started off the series strong, posting double-doubles in two of the first four games as the Jazz jumped out to a 3–1 series lead. In the fifth game, Williams was plagued by foul problems and struggled from the floor, hitting only one of eleven shots from the field and scoring just two points. However, despite Williams's poor performance, the Jazz posted a 100–87 victory, sending the Jazz to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 1998 and the John Stockton and Karl Malone era.\n\nThe Jazz faced the eventual NBA Champion San Antonio Spurs in the conference finals, a team led by Tim Duncan who had posted three NBA championships since 1999. Williams played his best basketball of the season in the first three games, averaging nine assists and over thirty points over that span. Spurs guard Tony Parker recognized Williams's effort after the Jazz won game three 109–83.\n\nSpurs forward Bruce Bowen also highlighted Williams's skills, as he compared Williams to the previous Jazz All-Star guard John Stockton.\n\nWilliams scored a then-career high 41 points on December 8, 2007 in a game against the Dallas Mavericks, although they ended up losing the game. He also had two 20-assist games on the season. He elevated all of his stats, improving to 18.8 points and 10.5 assists per game, third in the league behind Chris Paul and Steve Nash. Despite his strong performance during the season, he was not selected to represent the Western Conference in the NBA All-Star Game, as the point guard position was filled by Allen Iverson, Steve Nash, and Chris Paul. He did win the NBA Skills Challenge over All-Star weekend.\n\nMuch was made of Williams's new leadership role on the team, and how he calls the majority of the plays on the team instead of coach Jerry Sloan, something not even John Stockton did. In March, Williams recorded 212 assists, the most by any NBA player in any month since John Stockton in January 1992. The Jazz again won the Northwest Division and the four seed, this time with a 54–28 record, and again faced a Houston Rockets team that had home-court advantage in the first round. However, the Jazz won the first two games in Houston and went on to win the series in six games. In the second round, the Jazz lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games. Williams was the leading scorer for the Jazz in the 2008 playoffs.\n\nWilliams missed thirteen of the first fifteen games of the season due to a second-degree ankle sprain sustained in the preseason against the Chicago Bulls. He returned November 26 against the Memphis Grizzlies. Since that time, he has led the team through an up-and-down season plagued by injuries to several key players (most notably Carlos Boozer and Andrei Kirilenko), but despite averaging 19.2 ppg and 10.0 apg through the All-Star Break, he was again snubbed from the All-Star Game. Similar to the previous year, he responded to the snub with strong play, scoring 30+ points in five consecutive games before the break (he missed one additional game during this time due to a minor injury) and leading the team to a 5–2 record to close out the first half of the season, including a win over the league-leading Los Angeles Lakers to snap their seven-game winning streak. They followed the All-Star Break with a win against the defending champion Boston Celtics.\n\nOn March 1, 2009, Williams became the second active player after Steve Nash to reach 20 or more assists in at least four games in their career.\n\nOn December 14, 2009, Williams was named the Western Conference Player of the Week. A week after his teammate and pick and roll partner Carlos Boozer, was named The Western Conference Player of the Week. The Jazz hadn't had consecutive Western Conference Player of the Week Awards since 1997, when Karl Malone won it back to back.\n\nOn January 28, 2010, Williams was named to participate in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game at Cowboy Stadium in Arlington, Texas. This marked his All-Star debut. He was also invited to participate in the NBA Skills Challenge, where he finished second to Steve Nash.\n\nDespite playing with injuries to his wrist and ankle, and playing without starters Andrei Kirilenko and Mehmet Okur, Williams became just the second player in Utah Jazz history to record at least 30 points and 10 or more assists in a playoff game. John Stockton is the only other Jazz player to accomplish said feat, doing so twice in his career. Williams scored 33 points on 7–14 shooting from the field while making 16–18 free throws from the line, while also contributing 14 assists on the road in a game 2 win against the Denver Nuggets. He repeated that feat later in series while scoring 34 points and dishing out 10 assists.\n\nOn April 28, Williams became the first player in NBA history to record at least 20 points and 10 or more assists in five straight games in a playoff series. Williams points/assists through the first five games, in order, were 26/11, 33/14, 24/10, 24/13, and 34/10.\n\nAfter Sloan resigned mid-season on February 7, 2011, he denied reports that conflicts with Williams forced him to leave. \"I forced myself out\", Sloan responded. Williams acknowledged he had a disagreement with Sloan during the previous night's game, but he added, \"I would never force coach Sloan out of Utah. He's meant more to this town, more to this organization than I have by far. I would have asked out of Utah first.\"\n\nOn February 23, 2011, Williams was traded to the New Jersey Nets for guard Devin Harris, forward Derrick Favors, two first round draft picks, and $3 million in cash. While Williams was under contract through with a player option worth $17.7 million for , Jazz chief executive officer Greg Miller did not believe the team could re-sign Williams. \"And while I never saw any indication that he wouldn’t re-sign with us, I never saw any indication he would\", said Miller.\n\nWilliams's acquisition gave the Nets a proven NBA star to build around as the team was preparing to make the transition to their new home in Brooklyn. Williams's impact on the Nets was immediately apparent, although he played in just 12 games due to a nagging wrist injury. As a team, the Nets were one of highest scoring teams post all-star break and big men Brook Lopez and Kris Humphries both saw their scoring numbers increase as Williams averaged 12.8 APG during those 12 games. His 47 assists were an NBA record for a player in his first 3 games with a new team and no Net before him recorded double doubles in their first 5 games with the team. On April 11, 2011, Williams had wrist surgery on his right wrist which ended his season, although he was initially hesitant to having it. \"I was angry and tried to tell the doctors that I didn't want to have the surgery\", Williams said. \"The two doctors had me outvoted, two against one. I couldn't do anything about it. They told me that there was no reason to postpone it and if I didn't have it, I would be dealing with the same pain again.\" \n\nDuring the 2011 NBA lockout, Williams signed a one-year contract for $5 million net income to play for Beşiktaş of the Turkish Basketball League and the FIBA EuroChallenge. His contract allowed him to return to the NBA with the Nets once the work stoppage ended. Beşiktaş was the same team that signed Allen Iverson in 2010. Because Williams was still under an NBA contract, he required clearance from FIBA in order to play elsewhere.\n\nOn November 22, 2011, Williams scored 50 points against Göttingen, during a EuroChallenge first group-stage game. In the game Williams went 17–23 from the field and 7–10 on three point attempts and 9–11 on free throws. After a tentative agreement to end the 2011 NBA lockout was reached, Williams's jersey #8 was retired by Beşiktaş in a farewell ceremony prior to a game against Zorg en Zekerheid Leiden on November 29, 2011.\n\nAfter the lockout ended, Williams returned to New Jersey, hoping to lead the Nets to the playoffs for the first time since 2007. The Nets caught a bad break in the preseason, though, as Brook Lopez suffered a broken foot that caused him to miss more than 2 months. After winning their opening game at Washington, the Nets went on to lose their next six, putting them in an early hole in the standings in an abbreviated season. The Nets continued to struggle without Lopez, but Williams played well enough to be voted into the All-Star game for the third time in his career, as he averaged over 22 points and 8 assists at the break.\n\nWhen Lopez returned after the All-Star break, the Nets began to pick up their play. On March 4, 2012, Williams scored a career-high and Nets franchise-high 57 points against the Charlotte Bobcats. He broke the previous team record of 52 points held by Mike Newlin and Ray Williams. It was the most points scored in the NBA that season and the second-most points scored against the Bobcats by one player in a single game, second to Kobe Bryant. Lopez went down again with a sprained ankle and was out for several more weeks.\n\nWilliams remained optimistic that he would resign with the Nets, but was noncommittal as he said he wanted to keep his options open and become a free agent at the end of the season. Williams reiterated this stance on March 16 after the Nets failed to land All-Star center Dwight Howard at the trade deadline.\n\nOn July 11, 2012, Williams signed a five-year, $98.7 million deal to remain with the Nets, who had completed their move to Brooklyn. He was encouraged to stay with the Nets after GM Billy King completed a trade with the Atlanta Hawks for six time All-Star Joe Johnson, as well as re-signing young big man Brook Lopez and defensive player Gerald Wallace. Williams scored the first regular season points at the new Barclays Center on November 3, 2012 against the Toronto Raptors. The Nets won the game 107-100 as Williams finished the game with 19 points and 9 assists. On November 26, 2012 the Nets played their crosstown rival, the New York Knicks, at the Barclays Center. The game was scheduled to be played on November 1, 2012 and be the first game of the season for the Knicks and the Nets. The game was postponed due to weather in the New York City area involving Hurricane Sandy. The Nets beat the Knicks 96-89 in overtime, with Williams contributing 16 points and 14 assists. On December 27, 2012, the Nets fired head coach Avery Johnson after a 14 win, 14 lose start. Rumors circulated that Williams might have been involved in the firing, but Williams denied playing a role and said he was surprised Johnson was fired.\n\nWilliams announced that he would miss the final two games before the All-Star break to receive a cortisone shot in both of his ankles and platelet-rich plasma treatment in his ankles. His problems stemmed from a bone spur that was causing inflammation in the ankle.\n\nOn March 8, 2013 the Nets were playing the Washington Wizards as Williams hit 11 three-pointers in a single game, setting a Nets record. He hit 9 of the 11 threes in the first half, which was an NBA record for three-pointers in a half. Williams finished the night with 42 points in a Nets win.\n\nOn March 28, 2014, Williams recorded his 21st consecutive game with at least one steal, tying the Hawks' Paul Millsap with the longest such streak in the league in 2013–14. Two days later, Williams recorded a steal for the 22nd straight game, marking the longest streak in the 2013–14 season. On April 4, 2014, Williams recorded his 25th straight game with at least one steal, one short of the Nets' franchise record held by Jason Kidd and Mookie Blaylock. The next day, he tied the Nets' franchise record with a steal against the 76ers. He broke the record the next game with two steals against the Miami Heat on April 8. The streak ended at 31 on April 22 after he failed to record a steal in Game 2 of their first round playoff matchup against the Toronto Raptors.\n\nAfter leading the Nets to a 4-2 record to start the 2014–15 season, Williams was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, November 3 through Sunday, November 9. The award marked his first Player of the Week honor as a Net, having previously won the award three times during his tenure with the Jazz, and his first since the week of November 8–14, 2010. Despite a good start to the season injury-wise for Williams, he went down on December 19 in the 91-95 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers, limping off the court in the second quarter with a strained right calf and did not return. He subsequently missed the following two games, only to return on December 26 against Boston coming off the bench for the first time this season, losing his starting spot in favor of Jarrett Jack. He was later ruled out indefinitely on January 8 with a fractured rib that he suffered on January 4 against Miami. After an 11-game absence due to the injury, Williams returned to action on February 2 against the Los Angeles Clippers, recording 15 points and 3 assists off the bench in the 102-100 win.\n\nOn February 20 against the Los Angeles Lakers, Williams re-gained his starting spot from Jack after 13 straight games coming off the bench. He subsequently recorded 12 points and a season-high 15 assists in the 114-105 win. On April 3, 2015, he scored a season-high 31 points in a 114-109 win over the Toronto Raptors.\n\nIn Game 4 of the Nets' first-round playoff series against the Atlanta Hawks on April 27, Williams scored a playoff career-high 35 points in a 120-115 overtime win to tie the series at 2-2. The Nets went on to lose the series in six games.\n\nOn July 11, 2015, Williams was waived by the Nets. He received a buyout from the final two seasons of his contract with the Nets.\n\nOn July 14, 2015, Williams signed with the Dallas Mavericks. He made his debut for the Mavericks in the team's season opener against the Phoenix Suns on October 28, recording 12 points and 7 assists in a 111–95 win. On December 1, he scored a then season-high 30 points in a 115–112 overtime win over the Portland Trail Blazers. He missed the team's last four games of December with a left hamstring, returning to action on January 1 against the Miami Heat. He played in 20 minutes off the bench against the Heat, finishing with nine points and five assists. On January 5, he scored 25 points and hit the game-winning three-pointer in double overtime against the Sacramento Kings. On March 20, he recorded season highs of 31 points and 16 assists in a 132–120 overtime win over the Portland Trail Blazers, becoming the first Maverick with 30 points and 15 assists in the same game since Jason Kidd did so in 1996. Between late March and early April, Williams missed eight games with a left abdominal strain. The abdominal strain resurfaced for Williams in Game 4 of the Mavericks' first-round playoff series against the Oklahoma City Thunder, ruling him out for the rest of the game after just 89 seconds and later ruled him out for the rest of the season.\n\nOn July 8, 2016, Williams re-signed with the Mavericks. In the Mavericks' season opener on October 26, 2016, Williams scored a team-high 25 points in a 130–121 overtime loss to the Indiana Pacers. On December 3, he had a season-high 15 assists in a 107–82 win over the Chicago Bulls. Two days later, he had his first double-double of the season with 15 points and 13 assists in a 109–101 loss to the Charlotte Hornets. With seven assists on December 18 against the Sacramento Kings, Williams passed Derek Harper for 21st place on the NBA's all-time assists list with 6,584. On January 22, 2017, he had eight assists against the Los Angeles Lakers and moved into 20th place in NBA history with 6,715 assists, passing Kevin Johnson. On February 11, 2017 against Orlando, Williams returned after missing eight games with a sprained right big toe, getting seven points and four assists in 16 minutes in the first half before sitting out the second half on a minutes restriction. On February 23, 2017, Williams was waived by the Mavericks.\n\nOn February 27, 2017, Williams signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers. In his debut for the Cavaliers two days later, Williams scored four points in 24 minutes off the bench in a 103–99 loss to the Boston Celtics. On April 10, 2017, he had a season-high 35 points, nine assists and seven rebounds in a 124–121 overtime loss to the Miami Heat.\n\nWilliams won a bronze medal as member of the United States U18 team at the FIBA Americas U18 Championship in 2002. He was selected as a member of the USA Olympic team for the 2008 Olympics on June 23, 2008. The team went unbeaten on the way to winning back the gold medal after defeating 2006 World Champion Spain and living up to their \"Redeem Team\" moniker after missing out in the 2004 Summer Olympics. In 8 games in the 2008 Olympics, Williams averaged 8.0 points per game with 2.8 assists. Williams was one of three point guards on the national team, alongside Chris Paul and Jason Kidd.\n\nIn January 2012, Williams made the 19 man roster of the USA men's basketball team for the 2012 Summer Olympics. He ultimately made the final roster. The team won the gold medal by beating Spain for the second consecutive Olympics with a score of 107-100. During the Olympics, Williams averaged 9.0 points per game with 4.6 assists as he collected his second Olympic gold medal.\n\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2007\nWilliams was baptized as a Christian early 2010.\n\nWilliams appeared as himself on the Disney Channel show \"The Suite Life on Deck\" during the season 3 episode \"Twister: Part 1\" along with Dwight Howard and Kevin Love.\n\nWilliams married Amy Young, whom he had known since second grade and had dated since high school, and has four children.\n\nWilliams was the cover athlete for the video game \"NBA Baller Beats\" on the Xbox 360. Williams attended E3 2012 to promote the game, as well play the game in the NBA Baller Beats booth. Williams currently has endorsement deals with companies such as Nike, Vitaminwater, Red Bull and MetroPCS; he acquired many of the deals during his successful time with the Utah Jazz. Since joining the Nets, Williams has starred in commercials for Red Bull and MetroPCS.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2127808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127808", "title": "Buff-tip", "text": "Buff-tip\n\nThe buff-tip (\"Phalera bucephala\") is a moth of the family Notodontidae. It is found throughout Europe and in Asia to eastern Siberia. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of \"Systema Naturae\".\n\nThis is a fairly large, heavy-bodied species with a wingspan of 55–68 mm. The forewings are grey with a large prominent buff patch at the apex. As the thoracic hair is also buff, the moth resembles a broken twig when at rest. The hindwings are creamy white. This moth flies at night in June and July and sometimes comes to light, although it is not generally strongly attracted.\n\nThe young larvae are gregarious, becoming solitary later. The older larva is very striking, black with white and yellow lines. It feeds on many trees and shrubs (see list below). The species overwinters as a pupa.\n\n\nFor details see Robinson et al., 2010.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The company ran for 44 years. The theatre regularly produced local shows and hosted touring performances.\n\nThe former Fortune Theatre building is registered as a category I historic place by Heritage New Zealand, which recognises its historic and architectural significance. Originally a Methodist church, it is located on the corner of Moray Place and Upper Stuart Street, in the heart of the southern city of Dunedin. As of 11 December 2019, the building is empty with no current plans for the building.\n\nFinancial difficulties in 2000 threatened the theatre with closure, and forced the sale of the building to the Dunedin City Council, who leased the building back to the Fortune Theatre Trust.\n\nThe Fortune Theatre company was co-founded by David Carnegie, Alex Gilchrist, Murray Hutchinson and Huntly Elliot in 1973. The company was initially located in the 105-seat Otago Cine Club theatrette at the rear of the Athenaeum building of the Octagon. However, after hiring full-time acting staff in 1977, it was decided that the venue was too small to continue to be viable and in 1978 the company moved to the former Trinity Methodist Church where it remained until its closure in 2018.\n\nOver its 44 years the Fortune Theatre staged 407 main stage productions, and sold over 750,000 tickets. On it's closure in 2018 commentator Kate Prior said: \"Fortune Theatre has been an essential engine of new writing in New Zealand, a launch pad for some of our best actors, and an Otago and Southland theatre home.\"\n\nThe Fortune Theatre provided a range of options for schools such as tours around the theatre, and opportunities to talk to the cast and crew of a production. It also offered education workshops which were show-specific. The workshops were designed to link to a range of subjects in the New Zealand Curriculum, including NCEA achievement standards in subjects such as Drama at NCEA levels 1–3.\n\nIn addition, the Fortune Theatre hosted a drama ambassador programme to engage students with the theatre by offering opportunities to attend rehearsals as well as complimentary tickets. This programme began in 2005 with 19 schools in the Otago and Southland region areas of New Zealand.\n\nIn 1994, the Fortune Theatre performed a play about the tragedies of William Larnach's family, titled \"Larnach – Castle of Lies\", before 100 invited guests in the ballroom of Larnach Castle.\n\"It was a night to remember. As the guests arrived a terrible storm blew up from nowhere. The smoke from the fires blew back down the chimneys so that you couldn't see – and your eyes hurt. Hail crashed on the iron roof so that you couldn't hear. Doors mysteriously opened by themselves and it got very cold. In the play – just as Larnach shot himself there was a blinding white light. Afterwards at supper people were talking about the lightning strike as Larnach held the gun to his head. I said `Oh no that was stage effects.' We asked the stage manager. He said `It was none of our doing, it was lightning.' I think that Larnach was present that night. He didn't like the play.\"<br>-- Margaret Barker (Co-owner of Larnach Castle)\nIn 2005, the theatre was featured on \"Ghost Hunt\", a New Zealand television show, as it is claimed that the theatre is haunted. The Ghost Hunt investigation team were shown a photo which reportedly shows the ghost of a young woman gliding through a wall of the foyer, below a Gothic window Not long after the Fortune Theatre moved into the old church, tales spread of \"sinister voices\" being heard offstage and well-secured lights falling from the lighting grid. A phantom audience member has also been reported by theatregoers on numerous occasions. Reports continued to come from a variety of reliable sources until the claimed hauntings of the Fortune Theatre became a part of Dunedin folklore.\n\nThe Ghost Hunt investigation team visited the theatre and were shown a picture that is claimed to show the ghost of a young woman gliding through a wall of the foyer, below a Gothic window. During the investigation team's visit, they were also able to talk to people who had worked at the theatre and claim to have had paranormal experiences in the building:\n\nA lighting technician claimed that he was all alone setting up on stage one day when he \"glimpsed a person\" over his shoulder on the edge of the stage and thought that \"they were reading through some lines, as an actor would\" but knew no cast members were around at the time. He turned the stage lights on and \"suddenly they were gone\".\n\nA man who ran the box office claimed to have had two \"disconcerting\" experiences. The first experience involved a \"young boy sitting in the corner\". He initially \"thought nothing of it\" but the \"realisation struck\" him that the theatre was closed. He \"turned back around, but he'd disappeared.\" The second experience involved a girl he claims he noticed when he \"looked up to the back corner of the audience seating, near where the soundman usually sits\" after he heard \"a strange noise in the theatre\" on one occasion.\n\nThe Trinity Methodist Church was designed by Scotsman R. A. Lawson and was opened in 1870. Made out of the local materials trachyandesite and Oamaru stone, the former church is an example of Gothic Revival architecture and contains a \"Rose\" stained glass window which is located at the back of what is now the theatre's main stage. The building is close to the city's centre, The Octagon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2127811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127811", "title": "St Mark's Clocktower", "text": "St Mark's Clocktower\n\nThe Clock Tower in Venice is an early Renaissance building on the north side of the Piazza San Marco, at the entrance to the Merceria. It comprises a tower, which contains the clock, and lower buildings on each side. It adjoins the eastern end of the Procuratie Vecchie. Both the tower and the clock date from the last decade of the 15th century, though the mechanism of the clock has subsequently been much altered. It was placed where the clock would be visible from the waters of the lagoon and give notice to everyone of the wealth and glory of Venice. The lower two floors of the tower make a monumental archway into the main street of the city, the Merceria, which linked the political and religious centre (the Piazza) with the commercial and financial centre (the Rialto). Today it is one of the 11 venues managed by the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia.\n\nOn a terrace at the top of the tower are two great bronze figures, hinged at the waist, which strike the hours on a bell. One is old and the other young, to show the passing of time and, although said to represent shepherds (they are wearing sheepskins) or giants (they are huge figures of great mass, necessary so that their form can be recognized at a distance) they are known as \"the Moors\" because of the dark patina acquired by the bronze. The bell is also original and is signed by Simeone Campanato, who cast it at the Arsenal in 1497.\n\nBelow this level is the winged Lion of Saint Mark with the open book, before a blue background with gold stars. There was originally a statue of the Doge Agostino Barbarigo (Doge 1486–1501) kneeling before the lion, but in 1797, after the city had surrendered to Napoleon, it was removed by the French, who were purging the city of all symbols of the old regime.\n\nBelow again, is a semi-circular gallery with statues of the Virgin and Child seated, in gilt beaten copper. On either side are two large blue panels showing the time: the hour on the left in Roman numerals and the minutes (at 5 minute intervals) on the right in Arabic numerals. Twice a year, at Epiphany (6 January) and on Ascension Day (the Thursday 40 days after Easter, counting both days), the three Magi, led by an angel with a trumpet, emerge from one of the doorways normally taken up by these numbers and pass in procession round the gallery, bowing to the Virgin and child, before disappearing through the other door.\n\nBelow this is the great clock face in blue and gold inside a fixed circle of marble engraved with the 24 hours of the day in Roman numerals. A golden pointer with an image of the sun moves round this circle and indicates the hour of the day. Within the marble circle beneath the sun pointer are the signs of the zodiac in gold (these are original and date from the 1490s), which revolve slightly more slowly than the pointer to show the position of the sun in the zodiac. In the middle of the clockface is the earth (in the centre) and the moon, which revolves to show its phases, surrounded by stars which are fixed in position. The background is of blue enamel. The smaller blue circles in the four corners are not now used.\n\nBelow the clock is the archway, two storeys high, through which the street known as the Merceria leaves the Piazza on its way to the Rialto (This section of the Merceria is known as the Merceria dell'Orologio (of the clock)).\n\nThe buildings on each side have been let off separately as shops and apartments since the early 18th century.\n\nOn the other side of the tower, there is another great clock face above the arch, visible to people walking down the street towards the Piazza. This is a simpler affair, again surrounded by a marble circle marked with the 24 hours, but in two series of 12 hours each. The sun pointer, marking the hours, is the only moving part on this side.\nBy 1490 an old clock at the north-west corner of St Mark's church, the clock of St Alipio, was in a very bad state and in 1493 the Senate commissioned the construction of a new clock. The making of the clock was entrusted to a father and son, Gian Paolo and Gian Carlo Ranieri, of Reggio Emilia In 1495 the Senate decided that a tower to hold the clock should be erected at the point where the street known as the Merceria leaves the Piazza. Buildings were demolished to make room for it and building started in 1496.\nThe design of the tower is generally attributed on grounds of style (though without documentary evidence) to Mauro Codussi. The Merceria passes through the archway at the foot of the tower. It is one of the principal streets of the city and leads to the Rialto. Deborah Howard explains how the idea was probably derived by Codussi from Alberti's work 'De re aedificatoria' (\"About Building\"), published earlier in the 15th century, where he emphasises the importance of towers to a city and the appropriateness of a monumental archway as the entrance to its principal street.\n\nThe name of the sculptor who modelled the figures of the Moors is not known for certain. They have been most often attributed to Paolo Savin, but an article published in 1984 reached the conclusion that the most likely candidate is Antonio Rizzo. They were cast in bronze in 1494 by Ambrosio Delle Anchor.\n\nThe tower was built during 1496 and 1497 and the mechanism of the clock was then built into it under the supervision of the Ranieri. No expense was spared in the decoration of the tower and the clock, using quantities of ultramarine and gold leaf. Even the 'Moors' were originally gilded. The inauguration of both tower and clock took place on 1 February 1499. Sanudo wrote in his diary for this day that the clock was uncovered and seen for the first time as the Doge was leaving the Piazza to go to hear vespers at Sta Maria Formosa, adding that it was made with great ingenuity and was most beautiful.\nCodussi died in 1504 and the wings on either side of the tower were added by 1506 (perhaps to give greater stability to the whole). Barbari's great woodcut of Venice dated 1500 shows the newly built clock tower before the wings were built, rising high above the original 12th-century Procuratie on either side. These Procuratie were lower than the present buildings, with only one storey above the arches on the ground floor, so that the tower then rose high above all the buildings on that side of the Piazza.\n\nThe wings are sometimes attributed to Pietro Lombardi, who was later to rebuild the Procuratie on the same side of the Piazza, but the wings are of no great distinction and more probably designed by Gonella who was then the proto (buildings manager) of St Mark's. The wings were also originally two storeys lower than today, with the roof at the level of the existing terraces. A drawing by Canaletto shows the tower before the increase in the height of the wings. This makes the tower itself appear higher so that it makes a more positive statement as the grand entrance to a great city.\n\nBy 1500, when the final account for the tower was passed, the elder Raineri had died. It was arranged that his son should remain in Venice to look after the clock and he was granted flour concessions which would give him a good income. He lived in Venice until his death in 1531.\n\nFor more detailed and technical information about the clock, see the separate article on the clock.\n\nBy 1531, after the death of Carlo Raineri, the clock was already not working properly. The Council of Ten decided that a permanent keeper must be appointed to live in a wing of the tower and be responsible to keep the clock in working order. Later, in 1551, Jacopo Sansovino, then the architect responsible for St Mark's, was instructed to report on the state of the tower and clock. Major repairs were required, but by 1581, when his son, Francesco, published his description of Venice, all appears to have been in order.\n\nShortly before 1663 the clock face was cleaned and the blue and gold colours restored 'like new'. Already by this date the procession of the Magi did not take place daily but only at certain festivals and also every hour of the day on every day while the Ascension Day celebrations lasted.\nBy 1750 both tower and clock were badly in need of repair and restoration. In 1751 Giorgio Massari was employed to restore the buildings. In 1755 work started to add two additional floors above the roof terraces of the wings on either side of the tower. Andrea Camerata took over from Massari in 1757. The eight columns on the front of the ground floor were added in that year, presumably for extra strength.\n\nBartolomeo Ferracina was chosen to restore the clock mechanism. He made very extensive alterations, changing the movement from a foliot escapement to a pendulum system, which was much more accurate. The bands in the clock face which had previously shown the apparent movement of the planets round a central earth were removed. The marble circle round the clock face which had been marked, as now, with 24 hours, was covered by a circle showing two series of 12 hours and the Moors were also made to strike the bell in 12-hour cycles, with special rings involving 132 strokes of the bell, at midday and midnight. These changes were complete by 1757. Ferracina then turned his attention to the procession of the Magi, which had apparently not worked for many years, and the new mechanism was inaugurated on Ascension Day 1759. In order to prevent undue wear and tear, this continued to work only during the fortnight after Ascension Day.\n\nBy 1855 repairs were needed again. The top floor of the tower was reinforced and staircases were replaced by iron stairs. In 1858 Luigi de Lucia repaired and made further alterations in the clock mechanism, but preserving the essentials of the changes which had been made by Ferracina.\n\nAt this time a completely new feature was added, so that the time could be read more accurately than was previously possible. Panels were made to appear in the doorways on either side of the Virgin and child, above the clock face. Those on the left show the hour while those on the right show the minutes (changing every 5 minutes), each with white letters on a blue background. The numbers blocked the route of the Magi and additional machinery was designed to lift them out of the way when the processions took place. They originally had gas lights behind them so that they could be read at night. The mechanism operating these numbers caused trouble and was not working properly until 1866. Other improvements and alterations were also made in 1865/66 by Antonio Trevisan and Vincenzo Emo.\n\nThe two 12-hour cycles round the main face of the clock remained until about 1900 when the original 24-hour circle was discovered beneath them and they were removed.\n\nFurther adjustments were made in 1953 and the latest, extensive series of repairs and alterations (some causing controversy amongst horologists) were carried out from 1998 to 2006 (five hundred years after the tower and clock were first completed).\n\nStairways (steep and narrow) inside the building give access to the terrace on the roof, passing the clock mechanism on the way. Tours (in Italian, English and French) must be booked in advance.\n\n"}

He won BAFTA Awards in 1964, 1975, and 1979, and was nominated for an Academy Award on three occasions.\n\nSlocombe was born in London, the son of Marie (née Karlinsky) and journalist George Slocombe (1894–1963). His mother was Russian. His father was the Paris correspondent for the \"Daily Herald\", and so Slocombe spent part of his upbringing in France, returning to the United Kingdom in around 1933. He graduated with a degree in Mathematics from the Sorbonne. \n\nSlocombe initially intended to become a photojournalist, and as a young photographer, he witnessed the early events leading up to the outbreak of World War II. Visiting Danzig in 1939, he photographed the growing anti-Jewish sentiment. In consequence, he was commissioned by American film-maker Herbert Kline to film events for a documentary called \"Lights Out\", covering a Goebbels rally and the burning of a synagogue, for which he was briefly arrested. Slocombe was in Warsaw with a movie camera on 1 September 1939 when it was attacked by Germany. Accompanied by Kline, he escaped, but his train was machine-gunned by a German aeroplane. In 2014, he said of the experience that:\nI had no understanding of the concept of blitzkrieg. I had been expecting trouble but I thought it would be in trenches, like WW1. The Germans were coming over the border at a great pace ... We were trundling through the countryside at night. We kept stopping for no apparent reason, but we came to a screeching halt because a German plane was bombing us. After its first pass we climbed out the window and crawled under the carriage. The plane came back and started machine-gunning. A young girl died in front of us.\n\nAfter escaping from the train, Slocombe and Kline bought a horse and cart from a Polish farm, finally returning to London via Latvia and Stockholm.\n\nAfter returning to England, Slocombe became a cinematographer for the Ministry of Information, shooting footage of Atlantic convoys with the Fleet Air Arm. He also developed a relationship with Ealing Studios, where filmmaker Alberto Cavalcanti, who helped him obtain his position, worked. Some of his photography was used as second unit material for fiction films.\n\nSlocombe moved into photographing for feature films at Ealing Studios during the later 1940s, after being hired on the strength of his documentary work. Slocombe later described his early work on \"Champagne Charlie\" (1944) as amateurish, in one case resulting in a sequence having to be reshot. However, in his career, Slocombe worked on 84 feature films over a period of 47 years.\n\nSlocombe would later speak approvingly of Ealing's culture of script development. However, he also noted that its restrictive studio system headed by Michael Balcon, in which outside work was not normally permitted, made it impractical for him to attempt to begin a career as a director, something which he had considered.\n\nHis early films as a cinematographer included such classic Ealing comedies, notably \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" (1949), \"The Man in the White Suit\" (1951), \"The Lavender Hill Mob\" (1951), and \"The Titfield Thunderbolt\" (1953). He was particularly praised for his flexible, high-contrast cinematography for the horror film \"Dead of Night\" (1945), and for his bright, colourful West Country summer landscapes on \"The Titfield Thunderbolt\". \n\nApart from filming, Slocombe worked also on developing plans for shots, visiting prisoner-of-war camps in Germany as part of pre-production for \"The Captive Heart\" (1946). For \"Saraband for Dead Lovers\" (1948), shot in Technicolour, the production team settled on a muted, gloomy style unusual for the time, which Slocombe in 2015 considered as among his best work of the period. The style of the film, about a doomed extramarital affair in 17th-century Germany, was variously praised as unconventional and criticised for being excessively symbolic, while also leaving exterior and interior shots poorly matched.\n\nA special effect shot he created was a scene in \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\", in which Alec Guinness, playing eight different characters, appeared as six of them simultaneously in the same frame. By masking the lens and locking the camera down in one place, the film was re-exposed several times with Guinness in different places on the set over several days. Slocombe recalled sleeping in the studio to make sure nobody touched the camera. Slocombe personally regarded Basil Dearden as the \"most competent\" of the directors he worked with at Ealing. \n\nHe found widescreen equipment sometimes restrictive, finding the Technirama camera system used on \"Davy\" (1958) \"a block of flats\" and difficult to compose shots with.\n\nFinancial problems forced Ealing Studios to wind down from 1955 onwards, and close later in the decade. In 2015, Slocombe said of the period that \"we had to get on with our careers – there was little time for sentiment.\"\n\nFor \"The Italian Job\" (1969), Slocombe was hired by producer Michael Deeley because \"he tended to do very moody work, and he was very efficient\". Slocombe later remembered shooting inside Kilmainham Gaol, a genuine closed prison, and finding the experience unpleasant: \"the real thing, there is something quite terrifying about it. One knows hundreds and hundreds of people have suffered here...although this was a comedy, all this was still in the back of one's mind\".\n\nHe won the British Society of Cinematographers Award five times, and was awarded its Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. He also won a special BAFTA award in 1993. Roger Ebert particularly praised his work on \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" (1973), writing that it \"achieve[s] a color range that glows with life and somehow doesn’t make the desert look barren.\" Not all reviews of his later colour work were favourable: while his cinematography on \"Never Say Never Again\" (1983) has been described by one author as \"subtle, subdued...[it] creates a mellow mood\", it has also been assessed as \"muddled and brown\". Notable among his later films is \"Rollerball\" (1975).\n\nIn the 1980s, he worked with Steven Spielberg on the first three \"Indiana Jones\" films, after Spielberg enjoyed working with him as an auxiliary cinematographer on \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (1977). These were among his last major projects, as he was 75 at the time of filming the last, \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\", and also began to suffer from eyesight problems in the 1980s. He was quoted in 1989 as saying of it \"there's an excitement in doing action films. I probably enjoy them on a sort of boy scout level.\" Janusz Kamiński, cinematographer on \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", said that he deliberately shot the film to emulate Slocombe's visuals, in order to create an appearance of continuity with the previous pictures.\n\nSlocombe experienced problems with his vision from the 1980s onwards, including a detached retina in one eye and complications from unsuccessful laser eye surgery in the other, and was nearly blind at the end of his life. In his later years, he lived in West London with his daughter, his only child. \n\nHe was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours, and attended a BAFTA dinner in his honour in 2009. He turned 100 in February 2013. Despite his blindness, Slocombe remained able to give interviews into his last years, and was interviewed by David A. Ellis in a book entitled \"Conversations with Cinematographers\" in 2011 by French television in French, by the BBC on the invasion of Poland in 2014, and on the history of British films in 2015. He was quoted in the latter interview as saying \"it's a weird feeling to have outlived virtually everyone you ever worked with.\"\n\nSlocombe died at the age of 103, on the morning of 22 February 2016, in a London hospital from complications following a fall.\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nBAFTA\n\nSaturn Awards\n\nAmerican Society of Cinematographers\n\nBritish Society of Cinematographers\n\nLos Angeles Film Critics Association\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2127823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127823", "title": "Tenore contraltino", "text": "Tenore contraltino\n\nThe tenore contraltino is a specialized form of the tenor voice found in Italian opera around the beginning of the 19th century, mainly in the Rossini repertoire, which rapidly evolved into the modern 'Romantic' tenor. It is sometimes referred to as \"tenor altino\" (or \"contraltino\") in English books.\n\nIt is a type of tenor voice with a compass not much wider than that of the coeval baritenor, but able to sustain far higher tessiture. It means that the basic range remained substantially the classic one, from C to C: only the best baritenors, however, were able to reach up to such heights and used to pass anyway to the falsettone (or strengthened falsetto) register about G; for tenori contraltini, on the other hand, the threshold of the passage to the falsettone register rose two or three semitones, and they could so easily reach C but often up to E, or even, exceptionally, to F. The real difference, however, consisted in the tessitura, or the pitch range that most frequently occurs within the given piece of music and where the artist is called upon to execute syllabic singing with the best sound results. The tenore contraltino's required tessiture rose, so that the roles could not be sustained even by the best gifted baritonal tenors. Manuel García, for instance, who had a wide range as a baritenor, \"had L'italiana in Algeri in his repertoire, but faced with the extremely high tessitura and the mainly syllabic writing of ‘Languir per una bella’, he transposed the aria down a minor third, performing it in C major instead of E flat\".\n\nIn France, which was the only European country that had rejected the employment of castrati, a voice type similar to the Italian early-19th-century tenore contraltino had been developing since the 17th century. This voice type was called \"haute-contre\", and the majority of heroic and amatory parts were written for it in \"grand\" opera and in \"opéra-comique\". This type reached its apex in the age of Rameau. It was, in fact, a type of tenor voice extremely light and widely ranged, but nearly systematically uttered in falsettone in the high pitch, so as to somehow re-echo the castrato \"contraltista\" of the Italian stamp. This thesis, evidently borrowed from Rodolfo Celletti’s positions, does not seem to have been fully shared explicitly, in Potter's recent work about the tenor voice. According to him, the main difference between the 18th century Italian tenor (no longer so deep a baritenor, or \"\"tenor-bass\"\", as the seventeenth century one) and the French \"haute-contre\", was that the former would use falsetto (and not falsettone, which Potter never explicitly mentions) above G, whereas the latter would go up to B \"flat\" in full voice or, to be more exact, in a \"\"mixed head and chest voice, and not \"[in]\" the full chest voice that Italian tenors would develop later\"\" which is consistent with Celletti and the editor of \"Grande Enciclopedia\"’s terminology, in falsettone.\n\nBetween the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century, the shortage of castrati among available opera singers compelled coeval composers to contrive substitutes for the roles of \"primo musico\" in operatic companies. The solution that seemed the most immediate and the most according to tradition, was the so-called \"contralto musico\", or female singers—usually mezzo-sopranos rather than real contraltos—who could perform the roles originally written for castrati as well as the parts composed with female singers in mind. According to Rodolfo Celletti, in the first 35 years of the 19th century, more than 100 cases of original resort to the \"contralto musico\" can be counted up, and it was employed also by musicians of the rising post-Rossini generation, such as Donizetti, Mercadante, Pacini and Bellini.\n\nThe second possible solution involved the baritonal tenor, but this did not suit the Belcanto-style taste of coeval composers, who shared the traditional dislike for this vocal timbre, as it was considered vulgar at the time. The companies' choices were, as always, limited to the singers available to the various theatres, so this second solution was resorted to when there was no alternative. Rossini, for instance, had recourse to a baritenor as a lover in \"Elisabetta, regina d'Inghilterra\", at a time when his company included two major singers of that type, and also for \"Torvaldo e Dorliska\" and \"Armida\", where, beside the amatory protagonist, \"Rinaldo\", created by the very prince of Rossini baritenors, Andrea Nozzari, there appear additionally five or six baritonal tenors in secondary roles.\n\nThere were no contraltos available in the mentioned cases, nor was the singer Giovanni David yet, who was to provide Rossini with a third solution: a new type of opera seria tenor voice, springing from the experience of the so-called \"half character tenorini\", who used to be employed in comic operas and who had clearer and lighter, and therefore more agile, voices than those of the proper baritenors. After still using a basically central and slightly virtuoso writing for the tenor in his early comic operas, Rossini elevated the tenor's tessitura to extremely hard high pitches of virtuosity and coloratura as soon as singers' abilities allowed it. Such was the case of Serafino Gentili, the first performer of \"Lindoro\" in L'Italiana in Algeri, of the cited David, the first performer of \"Don Narciso\" in \"Il turco in Italia\", of Giacomo Guglielmi, the first performer of \"Don Ramiro\" in \"La Cenerentola\" and, finally, of Savino Monelli, the first performer of \"Giannetto\" in \"La gazza ladra\". When Giovanni David entered Barbaja’s company in Neapolitan theatres, he was entrusted with the young and/or noble lover’s parts, whereas Nozzari and other baritenors got the roles of rancorous or villainous antagonists, or of army leaders. The part of \"Otello\", created by Nozzari, cannot be considered a real \"amatory\" role, but \"has psychologically the characteristics of the modern baritone, whether he is seen as the heroic general or expresses fury and jealousy\".\n\nThe above-specified tenore contraltinos were characterized by high, brilliant and acrobatic singing, and could bravely confront baritenors in the hot-blooded challenge duets, as well as finely sing lovers’ elegiac melodies; they were, above all, able to sustain much higher tessiture than those of baritenors themselves. Such tenore contraltino characterization would be slightly attenuated after Rossini's moving to France, where it was possible to resort to the tradition of hautes-contre, who were equally versed in high singing, but rather more averse to castrato virtuosity, typical of Italian opera. Adolphe Nourrit can be regarded as the paragon of this expansion beyond the Alps of the tenor contraltino experience.\n\nThe usage of the new type of tenor voice, which includes John Sinclair, the Scottish tenor that first performed \"Semiramide\"’s \"Idreno\", passed then into the hands of the other contemporary composers, finding firstly and mainly in Giovanni Battista Rubini, and then also in Gilbert-Louis Duprez and Napoleone Moriani, David’s valid successors. With Rossini, though, a whole era had ended and the new realistic singing ideals of the Romanticism were becoming more widespread. Male coloratura sank into oblivion; Bellini who in \"La sonnambula\" still confronted Rubini with virtuosity on a par with the soprano, in \"I puritani\", less than four years later, but would call upon him to sing no more than a scanty number of melismas and Donizetti, who would always keep employing coloratura in the parts written for Rubini, would interrupt this usage with Duprez when the latter ceased posing as the former’s emulator. On the other hand, the falsettone register began, as well, to go out of fashion quite rapidly, as a simple recollection of Baroque antirealism times of yore: Rubini would raise up to high B the uttering of force (or forceful), improperly called \"from the chest\"; Duprez, in his turn, would have Lucca’s audience hear the first high \"C from the chest\" and would then give up elegiac singing of his former model Rubini, beginning to utter forcefully the whole high note range and also taking on many manners of baritenors, who were then still haunting the operatic scenes (dark timbre, firm accent, great phrasing nobility, quivering and passionate acting). The great Adolphe Nourrit, having proved himself unable to conform to the new singing and taste trend, having been overcome by Duprez at the Opéra through a forceful performance of \"Arnold\"’s role in \"William Tell\", which he himself had created, according to Rossini's expectations, by \"hautes-contre\"’s ancient graceful singing, ended his days in despair in Naples where he had resumed his studies with Donizetti, falling headlong from the window of a hotel's room. The brief season of the tenore contraltino was over and there had begun the new era of the Romantic tenor, whether it was called lyric or dramatic, elegiac or \"spinto\", \"robusto\" or \"di grazia\", which is still enduring till present times.\n\n"}

He wrote a subgenre of American poetry known as Cowboy Poetry. His most famous poem was \"Out Where the West Begins\".\n\nIn 1910, Chapman wrote his most famous poem, \"Out Where the West Begins,\". Chapman had read an Associated Press report of governors of the Western States debating where the American West actually began geographically. In response, he hastily composed a poem that celebrated the people and the land of the region.\n\nThe first of its three seven-line stanzas ran \"Out where the handclasp's a little stronger, / Out where the smile dwells a little longer, / That's where the West begins; / Out where the sun is a little brighter, / Where the snows that fall are a trifle whiter, / Where the bonds of home are a wee bit tighter, / That's where the West begins.\" The poem was an immediate sensation, widely quoted, often imitated, and often parodied.\n\nAccording to the dust jacket of Chapman's 1921 novel, \"Mystery Ranch\", \"To-day [\"Out Where the West Begins\"] is perhaps the best-known bit of verse in America. It hangs framed in the office of the Secretary of the Interior at Washington. It has been quoted in Congress, and printed as campaign material for at least two Governors. . . . [Chapman's poems possess] a rich Western humor such as had not been heard in American poetry since the passing of Bret Harte.\"\n\nThe popularity of \"Out Where the West Begins\" led Chapman to release it with his other poems in a anthology. In 1916, he published \"Out Where the West Begins, and Other Small Songs of a Big Country\", a fifteen-page volume issued by Carson-Harper in [Denver]. The book was an immediate commercial success; Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York immediately offered to publish a larger collection. \"Out Where the West Begins, and Other Western Verses\", as it was renamed, appeared in 1917 with fifty-eight poems. The title poem was widely reprinted on postcards and plaques. In 1920, \"Out Where the West Begins\" was first set to music. The poem later achieved a separate life on the concert stage.\n\nIn 1921, Chapman published the equally successful \"Cactus Center: Poems of an Arizona Town\", containing 30 poems. The Literary Review wrote of the verse, \"In vigor of style, [it] irresistibly suggests a transplanted Kipling\" (19 Feb. 1921, p. 12).\n\nIn 1919 Chapman moved to New York City, where he lived on the East Side of Manhattan. He took a job as a staff writer for the New York Tribune, which he held until his retirement in 1925.\n\nChapman's first novel, \"Mystery Ranch\" (1921), combined western adventure with murder mystery. The Literary Review dismissed it as \"melodramatic\" and provided \"little for the seeker of literary values\" (19 Nov. 1921, p. 190). However, \"The New York Times\" credited Chapman, \"known heretofore as a poet of the West,\" with being \"a clever technician in a new field\" (13 Nov. 1921). \"Mystery Ranch\" achieved a modest commercial success.\n\nAfter his wife died in 1923, Chapman married Kathleen Caesar, an editor at the Bell Syndicate; they had no children. He wrote fiction and nonfiction throughout his career as a journalist and continued after he retired.\n\nChapman's second novel, \"John Crews\" (1926), another adventure-romance of frontier life, sold better. Described by the New York Herald Tribune as \"a lively and continuously readable yarn,\" \"John Crews\" was successful enough to have a reprint edition by another publisher in its first year (28 Mar. 1926).\n\nIn 1924, Chapman published \"The Story of Colorado, Out Where the West Begins\", a nonfiction illustrated history of the State of Colorado. His final book was \"The Pony Express: The Record of a Romantic Adventure in Business\" (1932), a history of the Pony Express. Both books were commercial and critical successes.\n\nArthur Chapman died on December 4, 1935.\n\nIn 2010, both of Chapman's poetry books were republished in new editions.\n\n"}

The provveditore Luca Trum proposed in the Council to build two bridges across the Grand Canal, one here and the other at Santa Sofia. The members of the Council, however, laughed at him, and the motion was not even put to the vote.

A power forward–center, he played college basketball for the University of Arizona. He was drafted eighth overall by the New York Knicks in the 2005 NBA draft, and was the first college senior to be selected in that draft. He also played for the Portland Trail Blazers, Phoenix Suns, Orlando Magic, Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles Lakers, winning an NBA Championship with the Cavaliers in 2016.\n\nFrye attended St. Mary's High School in Phoenix, Arizona where he was rated as the No. 98 recruit in the nation by Hoop Scoop and the No. 13 center in the country by Fast Break Recruiting Service. As a junior in 1999–2000, he averaged 15 points, 12 rebounds, nine blocks and six assists per game for coach David Lopez as he led the team to a 26-7 record, a berth in the Class 5A state tournament semi-finals and a No. 19 national ranking by USA Today.\n\nAs a senior in 2000–01, Frye averaged 22 points, 15 rebounds, six blocks and three assists per game and he led St. Mary's to the 2001 Class 5A state championship with a 30-3 record. He was subsequently named Player of the Year by the Arizona Republic and the Arizona Gatorade Player of the Year while earning fourth-team Parade All-America and McDonald's All-America honors.\n\nAs a freshman at Arizona in 2001–02, Frye was a key contributor for the Wildcats as he started 25 of 34 games after working his way into the starting lineup by late December and stayed there for the rest of the season. He earned Pac-10 All-Freshman team honors after averaging 9.5 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.5 blocks in 23.9 minutes per game.\n\nAs a sophomore in 2002–03, Frye was an honorable mention All-Pac-10 selection and earned Pac-10 Player of the Week honors on February 27, 2003 following a win over Arizona State. In 32 games (27 starts), he averaged 12.6 points, 8.0 rebounds and 1.9 blocks in 25.4 minutes per game.\n\nAs a junior in 2003–04, Frye earned first-team All-Pac-10 and USBWA All-District 9 team honors. In 30 games (all starts), he averaged 15.9 points, 7.4 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 2.1 blocks in 30.3 minutes per game.\n\nAs a senior in 2004–05, Frye received the University of Arizona's Sapphire Award, which is given to the outstanding senior male student-athlete. He also earned the 2004–05 Pacific-10 Conference Sportsmanship Award. For a second consecutive year, he earned first-team All-Pac-10 and USBWA All-District 9 team honors, as well as first-team NABC All-NCAA District 15 selection. In 37 games (all starts), he averaged 15.8 points, 7.6 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 2.3 blocks in 31.0 minutes per game.\n\nFrye finished his four-year career at Arizona with eight double-doubles in 12 NCAA Tournament appearances while registering 93 double-figure-point and 35 double-figure-rebound games.\n\nFrye was selected with the eighth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft by the New York Knicks. He scored a season-high 30 points twice during the 2005–06 season. On March 21, 2006, he sprained his left knee ligament in a game against the Toronto Raptors when Raptors guard Andre Barrett lost his balance and smashed his shoulder into Frye's knee, causing Frye to miss the rest of the season.\n\nDuring the 2006–07 season, power forward David Lee led the team in rebounding and field goal percentage, and was statistically superior to Frye in almost every category, but Knicks' head coach Isiah Thomas, until February 3, 2007, kept Frye in the starting lineup. Thomas' rationale was that Frye was a superior perimeter shooter, and his perimeter shooting would make it harder for teams to double team Knicks leading scorer Eddy Curry. On February 3, in a game against the Orlando Magic, Thomas took Frye out of the starting lineup and replaced him with little-used center, Jerome James. James had only appeared in 19 of the Knicks' 48 games, and averaged 2.7 points and 1.9 rebounds in those games. Thomas explained the change, saying, \"I think Jerome is one of the best defensive big men in the game in terms of the center position.\" Frye was selected to the 2005–06 NBA All-Rookie first team, and finished fifth in points (45) behind Chris Paul (58), Charlie Villanueva (56), Andrew Bogut (55), and Deron Williams (46).\n\nOn June 28, 2007, Frye was traded, along with Steve Francis, to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Zach Randolph, Fred Jones and Dan Dickau. Frye wore jersey No. 44 after wearing No. 7 with the Knicks, as guard Brandon Roy already wore No. 7 for the Trail Blazers. As a back-up center in 2007–08, Frye averaged 6.8 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.\n\nIn September 2008, Frye had surgery to remove bone spurs from his left ankle. He went on to serve as a back-up once again in 2008–09 as he averaged a career-low 4.2 points and 2.2 rebounds per game.\n\nOn July 14, 2009, Frye signed with the Phoenix Suns to a reported two-year, $3.8 million contract with an option on the second year. In February 2010, Frye was selected to the NBA All-Star Weekend Three-Point Shootout, becoming the first center invited since Sam Perkins in 1997.\n\nAfter not taking up his contract option, Frye signed a new five-year, $30 million contract with the Suns on July 8, 2010.\n\nDuring the summer of 2012, Frye was screened at a regular team physical screening, and learned he had an enlarged heart via dilated cardiomyopathy, forcing him to sit out the entire 2012–13 season. As a result, Frye filled in as a broadcaster during pre-game shows for the Suns, starting with the November 2 home game against the Detroit Pistons. To recover from his heart defect, he took up yoga and golf, later on enduring more basketball related challenges like running and mid-range shooting. He was cleared to play for the Suns before the team's 2013 training camp practices began on August 30. He made his return on October 9, 2013 in the 104-98 preseason win over the Portland Trail Blazers. He made his first regular season return on October 30, 2013 in the 104-91 win over the Trail Blazers.\n\nOn June 23, 2014, Frye opted-out of the final year of his contract with the Suns.\n\nOn July 14, 2014, Frye signed with the Orlando Magic to a reported four-year, $32 million contract. His first season with the Magic was disappointing on the court, as Frye averaged his lowest point and rebound totals per game since his final season in Portland.\n\nOn February 18, 2016, Frye was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Jared Cunningham and a future second-round pick. Acquired for his ability to stretch the floor and for his outside shooting, Frye, in just his second game as a Cavalier on February 24, hit four three-pointers and finished with 15 points off the bench in a 114–103 win over the Charlotte Hornets. In the Cavaliers' 2016 second round playoff series against the Atlanta Hawks, Frye helped the team go up 3–0 with 27 points on 10-of-13 shooting, including 7-of-9 from three-point range, in a Game 3 win. The Cavaliers went on to sweep the Hawks and advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. There he helped the Cavaliers defeat the Toronto Raptors in six games. Frye's role in the NBA Finals was reduced, as he played minor minutes over the first four games, before failing to appear in the following three games. Despite being down 3–1 following a Game 4 loss to the Golden State Warriors, the Cavaliers went on to win the series in seven games.\n\nOn November 13, 2016, Frye scored a season-high 20 points in the Cavaliers' 100–93 win over the Charlotte Hornets. On February 14, 2017, following the announcement that Kevin Love would be out for six weeks with an injury, Frye started in Love's place and had 21 points and 10 rebounds in a 116–108 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. Frye helped the Cavaliers go 12–1 over the first three rounds of the 2017 playoffs to once again reach the NBA Finals, where they lost in five games to the Golden State.\n\nOn February 8, 2018, the Cavaliers traded Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 first-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr.\n\nOn July 19, 2018, Frye signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers, returning to the franchise for a second stint. On March 1, 2019, he announced that the 2018–19 season would be his last in the NBA.\n\nOn October 30, 2019, the NBC Sports Northwest announced that Frye joined their crew to co-host their new podcast program, Talkin’ Blazers Podcast.\n\nFrye is the son of the late Thomas Frye and the late Karen Mulzac-Frye. Fellow NBA player and former teammate, Tobias Harris, is Frye's cousin. His grandfather, John Mulzac, was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen.\n\nFrye and his wife, Lauren (née Lisoski), have 4 children.\n\nIn 2007, Frye established \"The Channing Frye Foundation\". The foundation was founded with the goal of pointing youth in a positive and healthy direction. In 2010, Frye and his wife established \"The Frye Family Foundation\" in order to give back to the communities that are important to the Fryes, in particular, Portland, Oregon and Phoenix. Frye also sponsors a charity kickball tournament in Portland.\n\n"}

The finished knot has the same shape at the front and at the back, has bilateral symmetry, and can be made using one or two threads. While the practice is comparable to Chinese knots, Korean knots differ in their braiding technique and are tied without the use of tools. They also differ from Chinese knots in their historic development.\n\nTraditionally, the knots were used primarily to hold hunting tools around the waist and their usage was initially limited to royal families, spreading later to common people. Today, modern Korean artists are using the traditional knots in their works.\n\nIn prehistoric times, Korean knots were used solely for practical purposes. They were tied around the waist and used to carry stone-axes, swords, and other tools used for hunting and food. Tools from the Stone Age exhibit holes where thread was looped through and then knotted. Similar evidence is found in relics of the Bronze Age. The knots were strengthened by twisting or weaving multiple strings.\n\nDuring the period of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, people began to see aesthetic value in knots and started to use them as decorations on clothes, swords, and more. The Samguk Sagi, the oldest extant record of Korean history, describes knot usage in everyday life during the Silla dynasty, noting rulers enjoyed using knots to adorn horses.\n\nDescriptions of various knot forms made in the Goryeo dynasty are in poetry and Buddhist art. During this period, knots were widely used as ornaments in accessories and for art. No knots from the Goryeo period survive today.\n\nDuring the Joseon dynasty, knots became more diverse and elaborate. They were used to decorate traditional instruments and clothes, especially women’s garments and jewelry. The Joseon rulers hired their own knot-makers to decorate the palace and jewelry for the noble family.\n\nDemand for knots were so high among Koreans that knots became commercialized. But demand decreased after the Japanese enacted policies designed to obliterate Korean culture and a surge of Western culture into the Korean peninsula shifted traditions. They became rarely seen in public.\n\nThere are more than 30 basic types of knots, but there are vast numbers of variations and regional version on these basic types. Some of the most common knots include:\n\n\nKnots of diverse colors were used as belts, identity tags, and as a decorative element on instruments. In the ruling palaces, knots were used to signify dignity and prestige. For religious purposes knots decorated Buddhist ornaments.\n\nThe most common use of knots was in Norigae, traditional Korean ornaments worn by women to decorate clothing. Norigae were used by all ages and social statuses to emphasize the beauty of Korean traditional costume, as well as decorate pockets carried separately. Though these knots were used across all social statuses, there were also cases when only specific people were allowed to use them. For example, only high government officials were allowed to use knots for decorating fans.\n\nAfter the establishment of a cultural industry bureau in South Korea in 1994, the use of knots modern life increased, especially in cultural products. Korean knots were also used in the designs of non-Korean artists, usually in forms of the Garackji knot (a basic knot used to fill space and give a classical touch) and the Mangsa knot (used on pouches for jewelry).\n\n1) Lee Jong Kyu, “Study of Fashion design using Korean Traditional Knots” (한국전통매듭을 응용한 패션 디자인 연구), Master’s Thesis.

However, a Japanese photograph taken from Johor Bahru that is held by the United States National Archives appears to show the building with its watch tower. Not much is known of its use during the Japanese Occupation, although wartime artefacts have been discovered at the site. Intelligence reports published in 1944 identify the building as a \"large administration building\". Three unoccupied light anti-aircraft gun emplacements in its vicinity are also mentioned in the report - an indication that the site was used as part of the anti-aircraft defences along the western perimeter of the Naval Base. \n\nFollowing the war, there was a proposal by the Royal Air Force (RAF) to convert the building into a Maritime HQ (a command centre for joint maritime air operations). The plans fell through due to signal interference from the nearby SUARA broadcasting Station. In 1959, the building was converted into the 'Naval Base Police Asian Quarters' - to house Asian naval base policemen and their families. A Sikh temple, the Gurdwara Sabha Naval Police, was also set up on its grounds (Sikh Punjabis made up a large proportion of the force's ranks). The arrangement lasted until the British military withdrawal in October 1971, when the force was disbanded. Families were however permitted to stay on until early 1972 to allow time to seek alternative accommodation. \n\nFollowing the pullout of the British forces, the building was assigned by the Bases Economic Conversion Department (BECD) to Ministry of Health for use as a secondary hospital to supplement the overcrowded Woodbridge Hospital. The new facility was earmarked as a site for the rehabilitation of patients with chronic schizophrenia. The first batch of 34 patients were moved into the 250 bed hospital in September 1975. The rehabilitation  programme included providing skills training to the patients to allow the patients to return to society. A large group of about 100 were permitted to work in the day time outside the hospital, or in a laundry, a nursery and a cafe on site in the day. The hospital was shut in 2001. \n\nThe building has seen use as the View Road Lodge – a foreign workers’ dormitory on two occasions – until 2017. The building today lies unoccupied. Based on the Master Plan for the area, the site is currently being reserved for redevelopment as part of the Woodlands North Coast Innovation District.\n\n"}

Her father, Andrew Richards (c. 1846–1916), was the son of slaveowners who had come to hate the institution, enlisting as a bugler and drummer boy in the Union Army at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. Following the conclusion of the war he had married his childhood sweetheart and moved to the western Kansas frontier, where he and his wife Lucy brought up Kate and her four siblings, raising the children as socialists from an early age.\n\nO'Hare briefly worked as a teacher in Nebraska before becoming an apprentice machinist in her native Kansas. After being moved by a speech by labor activist Mary Harris Jones, she became drawn into socialist politics. She married fellow socialist Frank P. O'Hare.\n\nShe unsuccessfully ran as a candidate for the United States Congress in Kansas on the Socialist ticket in 1910.\n\nIn the pages of the \"National Rip-Saw\", a St. Louis-based socialist journal in the 1910s, O'Hare championed reforms in favor of the working class and toured the country as an orator. In 1916 the Socialist Party of Missouri named O'Hare its candidate for U.S. Senate, heading the Socialist ticket in the state.\n\nAfter America's entry into World War I in 1917, O'Hare led the Socialist Party's Committee on War and Militarism. For giving an anti-war speech in Bowman, North Dakota, O'Hare was convicted and sent to prison by federal authorities for violating the Espionage Act of 1917, an act criminalizing interference with recruitment and enlistment of military personnel. With no federal penitentiaries for women existing at the time, she was delivered to Missouri State Penitentiary on a five-year sentence in 1919, but was pardoned in 1920 after a nationwide campaign to secure her release. In prison, O'Hare met the anarchists Emma Goldman and Gabriella Segata Antolini, and worked with them to improve prison conditions.\n\nAfter her release and the war's end, support for the Amnesty movement waned. In April 1922, to free America's \"Political Prisoners\" she led the \"Children’s Crusade\", a cross country march, to prod Harding to release others convicted of the same 1917 Espionage act she had been convicted. With support of the fledgling ACLU, the women and children stood at the gates of the White House for almost two months before Harding met with them, ultimately releasing many of the prisoners of conscience.\n\nO'Hare, unlike Socialist Party leader Eugene V. Debs and other prominent socialists at the time, was a supporter of racial segregation, and penned a 1912 pamphlet titled \"\"Nigger\" Equality,\" which attempted to appeal to Southern voters.\n\nKate O'Hare divorced Frank O'Hare in June 1928 and married the engineer and businessman Charles C. Cunningham in California in November of the same year. Despite her continued involvement in politics, much of O'Hare's prominence gradually faded. O'Hare worked on behalf of Upton Sinclair's radical populist campaign in the 1934 California gubernatorial election, and briefly served on the staff of Wisconsin Progressive Party politician Thomas R. Amlie in 1937–38. Esteemed as a penal reform advocate, she served as an assistant director of the California Department of Penology in 1939–40.\n\nO'Hare died in Benicia, California, on January 10, 1948.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was among the first aircraft in the world to be built in any quantity, all of which were produced by Curtiss during an era of trial-and-error development and equally important parallel technical development in internal combustion engine technologies.\n\nIt was also the aircraft type which made the first takeoff from the deck of a ship (flown by Eugene B. Ely off the deck of on November 14, 1910, near Hampton Roads, Virginia) and made the first landing aboard a ship () on January 18, 1911, near San Francisco, California.\n\nIt was originally fitted with a foreplane for pitch control, but this was dispensed with when it was accidentally discovered to be unnecessary. The new version without the foreplane was known as the Headless Pusher.\n\nLike all Curtiss designs, the aircraft used ailerons, which first existed on a Curtiss-designed airframe as quadruple \"wing-tip\" ailerons on the 1908 June Bug to control rolling in flight, thus avoiding use of the Wright brothers' patented wing warping technology.\n\nThe Model D was a biplane fitted with a wheeled tricycle undercarriage. The construction was primarily of spruce, with ash used in parts of the engine bearers and undercarriage beams, with doped linen stretched over it. The outrigger beams were made of bamboo. Prevented by patents from using the Wright Brothers' wing warping technique to provide lateral control, and with neither the Wrights nor himself likely to have known about its prior patenting in 1868 England, Curtiss did not use the \"June Bug's\" \"wing-tip\" aileron configuration, but instead used between-the-wing-panels \"inter-plane\" ailerons, instead, as directly derived from his earlier Curtiss No. 1 and Curtiss No. 2 pushers. In the end, this proved to be a superior solution. Both the interplane and trailing-edge ailerons on these early aircraft did not use a hand or foot-operated mechanism to operate them, but very much like the earlier Santos-Dumont 14-bis had adopted in November 1906, required the pilot to \"lean-into\" the turn to operate the ailerons — on the Curtiss pushers, a transverse-rocking, metal framework \"shoulder cradle\", hinged longitudinally on either side of the pilot's seat, achieved the connection between the pilot and aileron control cabling. Almost all Model Ds were constructed with a pusher configuration, with the propeller behind the pilot. Because of this configuration, they were often referred to as the \"Curtiss Pusher\". Early examples were built in a canard configuration, with elevators mounted on struts at the front of the aircraft in addition to a horizontal stabilizer at the rear. Later, the elevators were incorporated into the tail unit, and the canard surface arrangement dispensed with, resulting in what became called the Curtiss \"Headless\" Pushers.\n\nIn addition to amateur aviators, a Model D was purchased in April 1911 by the Aeronautical Division of the U.S. Army Signal Corps as a trainer (S.C. No. 2), and by the Navy as an airborne observation platform. A number of them were exported to foreign militaries, as well, including the Russian Navy. On November 14, 1910, Eugene Ely took off from USS \"Birmingham\" in a Model D. This was the first time an aircraft had taken off from a ship. On January 18, 1911, Ely landed a Model D aboard USS \"Pennsylvania\". This was the first aircraft to land on a ship.\n\nUpon his election in November 1915, Congressman Orrin Dubbs Bleakley became the first government official to fly from his home state to Washington, D.C. The trip was made in a 75 hp (56 kW) Curtiss biplane from Philadelphia, piloted by Sergeant William C. Ocker, on leave from the United States Aviation Corps at the time. The trip took 3 hours, 15 minutes, including an unscheduled stop in a wheat field in Maryland.\n\n\nA number of Curtiss Pusher original and reproduction aircraft exist, and reproductions of the design date as far back to the era when the original aircraft was in production, mostly built by private parties.\n\n\nA Headless Curtiss D was the aircraft used by Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon) as the pickup aircraft for a Skyhook-type lift in the prologue section of The Great Race. Fate's assistant, Maximilian Meen (Peter Falk) piloted the D and successfully made the pickup, but was unable to gain altitude and pancaked into a nearby pigpen.\n\n"}
{"id": "2127901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127901", "title": "Maceration (bone)", "text": "Maceration (bone)\n\nMaceration is a bone preparation technique whereby a clean skeleton is obtained from a vertebrate carcass by leaving it to decompose inside a closed container at near-constant temperature. This may be done as part of a forensic investigation, as a recovered body is too badly decomposed for a meaningful autopsy, but with enough flesh or skin remaining as to obscure macroscopically visible evidence, such as cut-marks. In most cases, maceration is done on the carcass of an animal for educational purposes.\n\nMaceration is a form of controlled putrefaction, a stage of decomposition in which the proteins of the body's cells are broken down and consumed by bacteria in anaerobic conditions. The temperature is usually maintained at a constant optimal temperature in an incubator. Maceration generates very strong and distasteful odors, and is therefore usually done in a closed container in a ventilated area.\n\nMaceration is an alternative to the \"Dermestes\" method in which skin beetles are used to clean the flesh off of the corpse, a method which is used with corpses of small mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, because these animals' bones tend to fall apart in many tiny parts. Maceration is an unsuitable method to clean the bones of a fish, as they have a poorly articulated, pliable skeleton.\n\nIn the process of maceration, the carcass is first skinned and defleshed by hand as much as is practical, and all internal organs are removed. In this process, extra care is taken when removing the eyeballs, ears and jugular muscles, because some bones are shallow and brittle, such as the thickened external acoustic opening of many mammals. The tongue is usually left in place, because of its attachment to the hyoid bone. Severed parts of the carcass are sometimes kept in nylon panty hose. Water is then put in a container and maintained a constant temperature, usually 35 °C though not warmer than 50 °C. Washing powder with enzymes (like Biotex) may be added, as it will soften the tissue. A mild detergent or emulsifier is sometimes used to remove fatty acids from the bone. When the carcass is put in the container, putrefying bacteria begin (or continue) to consume the soft tissue cells of the carcass, and will continue to do so as long as the temperature remains constant. After a few days, the water is replenished to maintain the bacteria, and some additional flesh may be cut away. Most medium-sized animals (like dogs) are macerated within about ten days.\n\nLipids and fatty acids in the bone and in the fat tissues tend to stain the bone brown. Oxidising bleaches may be used to whiten the bone, but if too much is used the perchlorate or hypochlorite damages the bone tissue, leaving it chalky and brittle. Hydrogen peroxide at quite low concentrations, say 1% to 3% replenished every few days, is less inclined to damage the tissue, though it may take a week or two to achieve complete whiteness.\n\nWhen the process of maceration is complete, the bones are removed from the solution and left to dry. If the skeleton is human and the subject of an investigation, the forensic anthropologist will then conduct an inventory and analysis of the remains. If the individual is to be identified, occupational and age-related osteological markers will be noted, and measurements of the bones will provide evidence suggesting the individual's height and race. If the skull is intact, forensic facial reconstruction is another option that may help in identifying the individual. If a crime has been established, an examination of the bones without overlying soft tissue may provide evidence on what weapon (if any) was used or on the nature of the injuries sustained.\n\nIn most cases, an animal is macerated for educational purposes. Once dry, the bones are collected, inventoried, and sometimes labelled or separated into labelled bags, all of which may then be placed in a container for storage. Alternately, steel wire is used to arrange the bones to appear as an articulated skeleton, and posed as the animal may have stood in life.\n\n"}

Rawlinson\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Arthur Richard \"Dick\" Rawlinson, OBE (9 August 1894 – 20 April 1984) was a British Army officer who served on the Western Front, and then in military intelligence in both World Wars. He served as head of MI.9a, and of MI.19. In peacetime, he developed a very successful career as a screenwriter and also produced several films.\n\nRawlinson was born in London, England, on 9 August 1894, the son of Thomas Arthur Rawlinson. He was educated at Windlesham House School, Rugby School and Pembroke College, Cambridge.\n\nAlready a cadet in the Officer Training Corps, Rawlinson was commissioned on 1 September 1914 as a temporary second lieutenant in the war-raised 6th (Service) Battalion of The Queen's (Royal West Surrey Regiment). He was promoted to temporary lieutenant on 29 December 1914. After a year's service he obtained a regular commission with the York and Lancaster Regiment, serving again as a second lieutenant. On 26 June 1916, he was seconded to the newly-formed Machine Gun Corps and promoted back to lieutenant on 21 December 1916. After he was wounded in action he began a career in Military Intelligence, 'employed at the War Office' in MI.1(a) as an acting major. He was awarded an MBE for his war service and resigned his commission on 27 February 1919.\n\nOn 14 April 1939, he transferred from the Reserve of Officers of the York and Lancaster Regiment to the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) and returned to active service. During World War II he served with the rank or major as the head of MI.9(a), a department of MI.9 responsible for vetting enemy prisoners of war. The department was later reconstituted as MI.19 in its own right. He retired from the service with the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel on 5 January 1946.\n\nIn the 1945 New Year Honours, the then Major (temporary Lieutenant-Colonel) Rawlinson was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), an advance on the recognition he had received after the previous war. On 23 May 1947, he was appointed Officer of the Legion of Merit \"in recognition of distinguished services in the cause of the Allies\".\n\nRawlinson married Alisa Margaret Harrington Grayson on 20 December 1916. She was the daughter of Sir Henry Grayson, Bt., the Conservative Member of Parliament for Birkenhead from 1918 to 1922. They had two sons: Michael Grayson Rawlinson (born 27 March 1918, died 1941 KIA), and Peter Anthony Grayson Rawlinson (born 26 June 1919, died 28 June 2006), who became the life-peer Lord Rawlinson of Ewell.\n\nRawlinson had a strong bond with the Grayson family. He was at Pembroke with Dennys Grayson, who served with the Irish Guards in Great War along with his brother, Rupert Grayson, and John Kipling, son of Rudyard Kipling. The shell that wounded Rupert Grayson in 1915 was the one that killed John Kipling. Dennys Grayson gave his son the distinctive name of Rudyard - as opposed to the unremarkable John - when the child was born the following year. Rawlinson married the sister of the Grayson brothers, Alisa, and the friends became family. Rudyard Kipling was keen to maintain contact with the young people who knew his beloved son, especially Rupert. It was through Rupert that Rawlinson was introduced to Kipling and was commissioned to write the screenplays to some of his works. \n\nRawlinson died 20 April 1984 in West Sussex, England.\n\n\n"}

It plays audio files, organizes playlists and maintains a music database. In order to interact with it, a client program is needed. The MPD distribution includes mpc, a simple command line client.\n\nMPD is used in proprietary audio hardware. The MPD project maintains a list of vendors, some of which infringe the GPL.\n\nMPD simply runs in the background playing music from its playlist. Client programs communicate with MPD to manipulate playback, the playlist, and the database. It is not a full-featured music player program such as Amarok, but its clients can serve such role.\n\nMPD uses a flat file database to maintain the basic music file information when it is not running. Once the daemon is started, the database is kept completely in-memory and no hard disk access is necessary to look up or search for local audio files. Usually, music files must be below the music root directory and are only added to the database when the update command is sent to the server. Playback of arbitrary files is only allowed for local clients which are connected to the server via Unix Domain Sockets. MPD does not provide a built-in tag editor; this functionality is handled by clients or external programs, though 3rd party patches do exist to add this functionality to the server.\n\nThe client–server model provides several advantages over all-inclusive music players. Clients may communicate with the server remotely over an intranet or over the Internet. The server can be a headless computer located anywhere on the network. Music playback can continue seamlessly when not using X or restarting X. Different clients can be used for different purposes – a lightweight client left open all the time for controlling playback with a more fully featured client used for intensive database searches. Several clients can use the same database, even running simultaneously – side-by-side, remotely or under different user accounts.\n\n\nMPD has a variety of front-ends which communicate with the server using a custom protocol over a TCP connection. Clients usually implement different types of interfaces.\n\n\n\n\nFor a more complete list, see the Clients MPD Wiki.\n\nSimple clients can script the mpc program to issue commands to the server. Some clients provide an HTML or AJAX user interface and can be located on the same computer as the server, requiring only a browser be installed on the client machine. There is a client implemented as a Firefox add-on, one as a Xfce panel plugin, and one as a Wii application, and one as a Windows Store application for Windows 8/Windows RT.\n\nLibraries exist to interface with MPD from many programming languages, including C, Python, Ruby, Perl, Lua and Haskell. libmpdee is an Emacs Lisp library allowing MPD to be controlled from Emacs.\n\n"}

Dunlap\n\nAlbert John Dunlap (July 26, 1937 – January 25, 2019) was an American corporate executive. He was known at the peak of his career as a turnaround management specialist via mass layoffs, which earned him the nicknames \"Chainsaw Al\" and \"Rambo in Pinstripes\", after he posed for a photo wearing an ammo belt across his chest. It was later discovered that his reputed turnarounds were elaborate frauds and his career was ended after he engineered a massive accounting scandal at Sunbeam Products, now a division of Newell Brands, that forced the company into bankruptcy. Dunlap is on the lists of \"Worst CEOs of All Time\" published by several business publications. \"Fast Company\" noted that Dunlap \"might score impressively on the Corporate Psychopathy checklist\" and in an interview, Dunlap freely admitted to possessing many of the traits of a psychopath, but considered them positive traits such as leadership and decisiveness. He was a major benefactor of Florida State University.\n\nDunlap was born in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1937. He entered West Point in 1956 and graduated with a degree in engineering in 1960. He then served in the United States Army for 3 years.\n\nIn 1963, Dunlap entered the business world at Kimberly-Clark as part of its manufacturing operations. He worked there for 4 years before being taken on at Sterling Pulp & Paper where he was put in charge of the family-run business.\n\nHe engineered a massive accounting fraud at Nitec, a paper-mill company in Niagara Falls, New York. He was the company's president from 1974 to 1976, when he was fired owing to his abrasive management style. An audit by Arthur Young (now part of Ernst & Young) revealed numerous irregularities, including inflated inventory and nonexistent sales—circumstances similar to the later Sunbeam case. The final result was that Nitec's $5 million profit for 1976 was actually a $5.5 million loss. Nitec sued Dunlap for fraud but was ultimately forced out of business. However, Dunlap never mentioned Nitec on his resume, and these scandals were not widely known until reported by \"The New York Times\" after the scandals at Sunbeam.\n\nLily Tulip Cup hired him as the president and CEO in 1983. In 1985, he was given the additional title of chairman of the company.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1993, he was CEO for Consolidated Press Holdings (CPH), a private company belonging to the Packer family, after Kerry Packer took a leave of absence due to health reasons. At the time, CPH had a diverse portfolio in media and publishing as well as chemical and agricultural operations. While there, he had mentored James Packer for the three years.\n\nIn 1994, Dunlap became the CEO of Scott Paper after Philip E. Lippincott stepped down from the position. In 1995, he sold Scott Paper to Kimberly-Clark for $9 billion and made $100 million from the deal via stock options and appreciation of his holdings.\n\nDunlap took over as chairman and CEO of Sunbeam in 1996. His methods resulted in Sunbeam's reporting record earnings of $189 million in 1997.\n\nOn March 3, 1998, Sunbeam announced the acquisitions of camping gear maker Coleman Company, coffee machine maker Signature Brands (best known for making Mr. Coffee), and smoke detector maker First Alert. Sunbeam's stock rose 9% on the news.\n\nIn the second quarter of 1998, the board of directors of Sunbeam investigated aggressive accounting practices and extreme discounting carried out at the direction of Dunlap. On June 13, 1998, Dunlap was fired. As the fraud was further uncovered in late 1998, Sunbeam was forced to restate financial results dating back to 1996 multiple times.\n\nIn 2001, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Dunlap, alleging that he had engineered a massive accounting fraud. Also named in the suit were four other former Sunbeam executives and Phillip E. Harlow, the lead partner for Sunbeam's account with Arthur Andersen. An SEC investigation revealed that Dunlap and others had created the impression of a greater loss in 1996 in order to make it look like the company had experienced a dramatic turnaround in 1997. By the SEC's estimate, at least $60 million of Sunbeam's 1997 earnings were fraudulent. He also offered incentives for retailers to sell products that would have otherwise been sold later in the year, a practice known as \"channel stuffing,\" and used illegal bill and hold practices. The SEC also argued that the purchases of Coleman, Signature, and First Alert were made to conceal Sunbeam's growing problems. Sunbeam never recovered from the scandal and was forced into bankruptcy in 2002.\n\nDunlap was also suspected of irregularities at Scott Paper. Not long after the shareholder settlement, he agreed to pay $500,000 to settle the SEC's charges. He was also banned from serving as an officer or director of any public company. The United States Department of Justice investigated Sunbeam's management during Dunlap's tenure but ultimately did not file any charges.\n\nThe shareholder lawsuit against Dunlap dragged on until 2002, when he agreed to pay $15 million to settle the allegations.\n\nDunlap died at his home in Ocala, Florida, on January 25, 2019, following a short illness. His death was announced by Florida State University, of which he was a major benefactor.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Judy Dunlap and son Troy Dunlap.\n\nA documentary film was made about Dunlap in 1998 called \"Cutting to the Core—Albert J. Dunlap\".\n\nA documentary film by the BBC about business titans in Britain prominently featuring Dunlap called \"The Mayfair Set\" was released in 1999.\n\nIn 2001, he was caricatured in \"Titans of Finance\" (Alternative Comics, 2001, ) by Rob Walker and Josh Neufeld. The comic book is a collaboration between a cartoonist and a finance columnist, which casts Wall Street executives and traders as heroes and villains. The lead story features Ronald O. Perelman, and Mike Vranos and Victor Niederhoffer are among those included.\n\nIn 2002, a documentary film by the U.S. TV program \"Frontline\" was released named \"Bigger than Enron\". It detailed the events that occurred at Sunbeam when Dunlap was CEO and investigated the accounting practices that were implemented.\n\nBy Dunlap:\n\nAbout Dunlap:\n\n"}

{"id": "2127927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127927", "title": "Marxophone", "text": "Marxophone\n\nThe Marxophone is a fretless zither played via a system of metal hammers. It features two octaves of double melody strings in the key of C major (middle C to C<nowiki>\"</nowiki>), and four sets of chord strings (C major, G major, F major, and D7). Sounding somewhat like a mandolin, the Marxophone's timbre is also reminiscent of various types of hammered dulcimers.\n\nThe player typically strums the chords with the left hand. The right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings. A brief stab on a metal strip bounces the hammer off a string pair to produce a single note. Holding the strip down makes the hammer bounce on the double strings, which produces a mandolin-like tremolo. The bounce rate is somewhat fixed, as it is based on the spring steel strip length, hammer weight, and string tension—but a player can increase the rate slightly by pressing higher on the strip, effectively moving its pivot point closer to the lead hammer.\n\nNumerically coded sheet music prepared specifically for the Marxophone indicates when and in what order to play melody and chord strings. This type of music, similar to tablature, was produced for those who could not read standard notation. A rectangular piece of metal provides a backstop for the spring steel hammers, displays the name Marxophone and the patent number, and has clips that hold sheet music. It also marks the 15 keys by letter (C, D, etc.), by number (1-15) and in standard musical notation. When the instrument is moved or stored, the metal rectangle bends down, holding the keys against the strings, so the Marxophone can fit into its case—which is the size of a large briefcase.\n\nA common misconception is that that the Marxophone was manufactured by the Marxochime Colony of New Troy, Michigan, but it was not. While the design of its hammer mechanism was patented by Henry Charles Marx (1875–1947), (pat. #1044553 issued on November 19, 1912) the Marxophone was never manufactured by the Marxochime Colony. Instead, during their tenure from 1927 to 1972, the \"colony\" designed and manufactured a wide assortment of \"bowed\" zithers, the melody strings actuated with a bow not hammers. The 1912 patent was assigned to the Phonoharp Company, which Marx was affiliated with at the time. Phonoharp manufactured Marxophones as well as Celestaphones (having a different body contour) until its merger with Oscar Schmidt Inc. in 1926. The newly formed company known as the International Musical Corporation produced Marxophones between 1926 and 1931. Then, following the International Musical Corporation's dissolution on December 30, 1931, two successor companies, the Oscar Schmidt-International Corporation (1931-1936) and Oscar Schmidt-International, Inc., (late 1936 till the present ), manufactured Marxophones until the 1950s.\n\nMarx was one of a number of late 19th century and early 20th century musical gadget manufacturers that combined two or more instruments into one. Other inventions included the Banjolin, the Hawaiiphone, the Mandolin-Uke, the Marxolin, the Pianoette, the Pianolin, and the Tremoloa. Marxophones were billed as easy to play, and sold on time-purchase plans by door-to-door salesmen, and through mail-order companies like Sears-Roebuck.\n\nBecause the hammers are made of white lead, the instrument sheds small amounts of lead powder. Musicians who actively use this instrument have adopted the practice of coating the hammers in Epoxy glue, which does not affect the sound but stops the wearing away of the hammers (and prevents the poisoning of children, cats and other small creatures).\n\nIn addition to being limited to the keys of C major and A minor (and modal variants), the Marxophone is partially limited to certain tempos because of the rate at which the hammers bounce on the strings. The fixed pulse rate of the hammer strike fits the music best when it is a power-of-two denominated fraction of the pulse of the music, in other words an 8th, 16th, 32nd, or 64th note of the performance tempo.\n\nVariants on the Marxophone idea include the \"Hammer-Jammer,\" a hammer-frame that attaches to the fingerboard—and the 2010 \"Marxoguitar\" created by Ranjit Bhatnagar. which attaches to an electric guitar at the bridge to produce a Marxophone-like tremolo effect.\n\nThe Marxophone did not become widely known to the general public, but recording artists such as The Doors, The Beach Boys, and John Prine used its unique sound, and it is still used by modern-day musicians, including such notables as Norway's Avant-Garde artist Sturle Dagsland and American rock band the Stone Temple Pilots.\n\n\n"}

She won a record eight singles titles at the U.S. Championships.\n\nAlthough she had won a bronze medal in singles for Norway at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, and was the many-time champion of her homeland, Mallory was relatively unknown when she arrived in New York City to begin work as a masseuse in 1915. She entered the U.S. Indoor Championships that year unheralded and beat Marie Wagner 6–4, 6–4, which was the first of her five singles titles at that tournament. She also won the singles title in Cincinnati in 1915.\n\nMallory had less in the way of stroke equipment than most tennis champions. But the sturdy, Norwegian-born woman, the daughter of an army officer, was a fierce competitor, running with limitless endurance. Robert (Bob) Kelleher, a former president of the United States Tennis Association (USTA) and a ball boy during Mallory's era, once said, \"She looked and acted tough when she was on the court hitting tennis balls. She walked around in a manner that said you'd better look out or she'd deck you. She was an indomitable scrambler and runner. She was a fighter.\"\n\nShe was a player of the old school. She held that a woman could not sustain a volleying attack in a long match. \"I do not know a single girl who can play the net game.\" Therefore, she relied on her baseline game, consisting of strong forehand attacks and a ceaseless defense that wore down her opponents. She took the ball on the rise and drove it from corner to corner to keep her opponent on the constant run. Her quick returns made her passing shots extremely effective. She once said, \"I find that the girls generally do not hit the ball as hard as they should. I believe in always hitting the ball with all my might, but there seems to be a disposition to 'just get it over' in many girls whom I have played. I do not call this tennis.\"\n\nHer second round match with Suzanne Lenglen at the 1921 U.S. National Championships brought Mallory her greatest celebrity. Before the match, Bill Tilden advised Mallory to \"hit the cover off the ball.\" Once the match began, Mallory \"attacked with a vengeance\" and was ahead 2–0 (40–0) when Lenglen began to cough. Mallory won the first set 6–2 and was up 40–0 on Lenglen's serve in the first game of the second set when Lenglen began to weep and walked to the umpire's stand and informed the official that she was ill and could not continue. After the match, the USTA accused Lenglen of feigning illness. The French Tennis Federation (FTF) exonerated Lenglen and accepted her testimony (and a doctor's) that she had been ill. However, Albert de Joannis, vice president of the FTF who accompanied Lenglen during her trip to the United States, quit his post in protest of the FTF's conclusion. He claimed that Lenglen was \"perfectly fit\" during the match and that, \"She was defeated by a player who on that date showed a better brand of tennis.\"\n\nLenglen avenged the loss by defeating Mallory 6–2, 6–0 in 26 minutes in the 1922 Wimbledon final, the shortest final in a Grand Slam tournament on record. Lenglen reportedly said to Mallory after the match, \"Now, Mrs. Mallory, I have proved to you today what I could have done to you in New York last year,\" to which Mallory replied, \"Mlle. Lenglen, you have done to me today what I did to you in New York last year; you have beaten me.\" However, Kathleen McKane Godfree has said that Lenglen denied this exchange. Lenglen claimed that she merely said \"thank you\" to Mallory and coughed very suggestively behind an uplifted hand. This was to remind Mallory that she – Lenglen – had indeed had whooping cough in their New York match the previous year. The two played for the last time that summer in Nice, France with Lenglen winning 6–0, 6–0. This completed the head-to-head rivalry between the players, with Lenglen winning their first match at the 1921 World Hard Court Championships 6–3, 6–2, after which Mallory said about Lenglen, \"She is just the steadiest player that ever was. She just sent back at me whatever I sent at her and waited for me to make a fault. And her returns often enough were harder than the shots I sent up to her.\"\n\nMallory won the singles title at the U.S. Championships a record eight times in fifteen attempts, with the last of her titles occurring at age 42 in 1926. Her worst finish there was a quarterfinal loss in 1927 at age 43. In 1926, Mallory hit one of the heights of her career when she came back from 0–4 in the third set of the final against Elizabeth Ryan, saving a match point in winning her eighth championship. Her farewell to the U.S. Championships was as a 45-year-old semifinalist in 1929, losing to Helen Wills Moody 6–0, 6–0 after having defeated the first foreign seeded player Betty Nuthall in the quarterfinal. Mallory is the only woman other than Chris Evert to have won the U.S. Championships four consecutive times.\n\nShe died on November 22, 1959, aged 75, in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nAccording to A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail, Mallory was ranked in the world top ten from 1921 (when the rankings for women began) through 1927, reaching a career high of World No. 2 in those rankings in 1921 and 1922. She was ranked in the U.S. top ten 13 consecutive years from 1915 through 1928 (no rankings were issued in 1917) and was top ranked from 1915 through 1922 and in 1926.\n\nMallory was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1958.\n\nIn 1916, she co-authored a book, \"Tennis for Women\" with Samuel Crowther.\n\nR = tournament restricted to French nationals.<br>\nSR = the ratio of the number of Grand Slam singles tournaments won to the number of those tournaments played.\n\nThrough 1923, the French Championships were open only to French nationals. The World Hard Court Championships (WHCC), actually played on clay in Paris or Brussels, began in 1912 and were open to all nationalities. The results from that tournament are shown here from 1912 through 1914 and from 1920 through 1923. The Olympics replaced the WHCC in 1924, as the Olympics were held in Paris. Beginning in 1925, the French Championships were open to all nationalities, with the results shown here beginning with that year.\n\nMrs. Mallory was the first female tennis player to win four consecutive major titles, which happened to be four titles of the same tournament.\n\nMrs. Mallory was the first female tennis player to reach the quarterfinals at more than one Grand Slam singles tournament within one calender year.\n\nShe was the daughter of Major Axel Johan Bjurstedt (born 1848) and Anna Benedicte Jenssen (born 1854); Anna Benedicte was the daughter of landowner Benedict Jenssen.\n\nOn September 18, 1920, at the age of 36, she married stock broker Franklin Mallory.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2127952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127952", "title": "C4 (New Zealand TV channel)", "text": "C4 (New Zealand TV channel)\n\nC4 was a New Zealand television channel owned and operated by MediaWorks New Zealand. C4 was available on both digital terrestrial and satellite platforms and played music around the clock and had some speciality music shows such as \"HomeGrown\" (New Zealand music show), \"Video Hits\" and \"Biggest Records Right Now\". The channel was originally launched in 2003 as a re-branding of TV4 which had been broadcasting since 1997. On 1 May 2010, as C4 had been moving away from music programming since 2008, the jukebox side was split off and was re-launched as C4 2. C4 2 was only available on digital Freeview terrestrial and satellite platforms. At the end of 2010 an announcement was made that MediaWorks would again re-brand the current C4 channel as FOUR, which meant C4 2 would become just C4. C4 shut down on 26 June 2014 at 1 am. It was replaced by The Edge TV on 27 June 2014 at 4 pm.\n\nC4 was launched on 3 October 2003, when TV4 (which first aired in 1997) ceased broadcasting and relaunched as a music channel called C4. The very first show broadcast on C4 was the \"100 Best Music Videos of All Time\" a countdown show where viewers voted prior to the show for their favourite songs of all time. TV Programming on C4 included local made shows such as \"Select Live\" and \"The Official NZ Top 40\". New Zealand On Air paid $500,000 for the first year of operation and C4 was to broadcast 58 hours a week of music television in prime-time, reaching 72% of the population, with a target of 20–25% New Zealand music content.\n\nC4 had a deal with MTV Networks to air MTV programming in New Zealand, which proved successful, with shows such as \"Pimp My Ride\" proving popular among C4's target demographic. The MTV content on C4 remained on air after Sky TV launched a local MTV station featuring some of the same shows. MTV content was decreased in 2008 when the channel moved towards General Entertainment programming.\n\nOn 11 April 2007 C4 began broadcasting in on SKY TV in New Zealand the same day TV3 began broadcasting in a format. C4 then switched to a 16:9 widescreen format on 2 May 2007, the same day as Freeview launched. C4 screened in letterboxed on analogue VHF broadcasts.\n\n24-hour broadcasts began in 2007 but only to digital viewers, in the TV4 days outside broadcast hours viewers would see a test pattern with Auckland's More FM playing in the background this was later replaced with Channel Z. Later the test pattern was replaced with overnight Informercials and Auto TV a show used to advertise cars. The move to 24-hour broadcasting saw the channel play continuous music videos overnight followed by a music breakfast show with no presenters, analogue viewers continued to see Infomercials during these times.\n\nFrom 1 July 2008, the channel began the process of changing from a music channel to a youth oriented entertainment network, operating under the same programming direction of its sister station TV3. In addition, C4 moved to channel 12 on Sky Digital and TelstraClear InHome TV platforms to reflect its new programming direction with a reduced focus on music.\n\nOn 1 May 2010, as part of the contract with Freeview to provide at least four channels, MediaWorks launched a second C4 channel C4 2. C4 2 screened back to back a low cost jukebox of music videos, unhosted and uninterrupted. The channel was exclusively on the Freeview platform on channel 9.\n\nAt 6:00pm on 6 February 2011, C4 moved to Channel 9 on Freeview, thus replacing C4 2. MediaWorks then launched FOUR in place of C4. The final show screened on C4 before the changeover was the \"Top 100 Music Videos Ever\" a similar show was used to launch C4 in 2003. The final music video screened before the changeover was \"Thriller\" by Michael Jackson. From 2011 onwards C4 screened a low cost jukebox of music videos once again compiled by theme and a re-run of FOUR live, many of the entertainment shows seen on C4 between 2008 and 2011 were moved to FOUR. C4 was available exclusively to Freeview viewers until 2012 when C4 returned to Sky.\n\nOn 25 September 2012, MediaWorks in an effort to get more regional advertising for \"TV3\" decided to provide four regional simulcasts of the channel on the Freeview satellite platform, which resulted in no space for \"C4\", so it was decided to replace the Sky simulcast of FOUR (which was already simulcast on Freeview) with C4, meaning only satellite viewers with either a generic DVB or Sky supplied receiver would be the only ones to get all channels via satellite. Due to a number of certified Freeview receivers only scanning and setting Freeview channels. From October 2013, the TVNZ metadata on the Freeview satellite service was changed to include the C4 feed on the Sky service, so that certified Freeview receivers could manually add the channel.\n\nC4 ceased broadcasting operations on 26 June 2014 at 1am. The final show to air on C4 was \"C42\". The final music video to air on C4 was \"Exit To The City\" by The D4. A new music channel was launched by MediaWorks to replace C4 called The Edge TV which is run by The Edge radio station also owned by MediaWorks. The Edge TV was actually launched on Freeview channel 11 and a time shift version of FOUR called FOUR + 1 was launched in place of C4.\n\n\"Amp'd\" aired on Thursday nights.

Founded in 1933 as an information bureau that informed Jewish communities and governments worldwide about the persecution of the Jews under the Nazis, it was transformed into a research institute and public access library after the end of World War II and is situated in Russell Square, London.\n\nIn 2017, and following a campaign by Dan Plesch, (director of the Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy at SOAS University of London) and other researchers, directed at the UN, the library published an online and searchable version of the catalogue of the archive of the UN War Crimes Commission.\n\nIt is also home to the UK’s digital copy of the International Tracing Service archive, the physical copy of which is held in the Arolsen Archives – International Center on Nazi Persecution in Bad Arolsen, Germany.\n\nAlfred Wiener, a German Jew who worked for the Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens (Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith), a Jewish civil rights group, spent years documenting the rise of antisemitism. He collected books, photographs, letters, magazines and other materials, including school primers and children's games, recording the spread of Nazi propaganda and its racist doctrines.\n\nIn 1933, Wiener fled Germany for Amsterdam, where he operated the Jewish Central Information Office (JCIO). became its president. Cohen was a prominent Dutch Jew who founded the Committee for Jewish Refugees at the same time; the Committee used the work of the JCIO for its publications, and provided some financial support to the JCIO.\n\nAfter \"Kristallnacht\" in November 1938, Wiener and the JCIO archives were relocated in Britain. Wiener's wife Margarethe (nee Saulmann) and three daughters Ruth, Eva, and Mirjam remained in the Netherlands and on 20 June 1943 were detained by the Nazis and sent to Westerbork transit camp. In January 1944, after seven months in Westerbork, the family were deported to Bergen-Belsen. In January 1945, a rare opportunity to be part of a prisoner scheme between the Nazis and the United States appeared. The Wieners were chosen for this exchange and transported to Switzerland. Shortly afterward, Margarethe became too ill to continue travelling. On 25 January 1945, she was taken into a Swiss hospital and died just a few hours later. Soon after, Ruth, Eva, and Mirjam boarded a Red Cross ship, the \"Gripsholm\", bound for New York where they were reunited with their father.\n\nThe collection opened in London on 1 September 1939, the day of the Nazi invasion of Poland. In London, the Jewish Central Information Office functioned as a private intelligence service. Wiener was paid by the British government to keep Britain informed of developments in Germany. The Library remained true to its original purpose by documenting specifically the fate of Europe’s Jewish population as exemplified by its own publication, \"Jewish News.\"\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the library used its extensive collections on National Socialism and the Third Reich to provide material to the United Nations War Crimes Commission for bringing war criminals to justice. Increasingly the collection was referred to as ‘Dr Wiener's Library' and eventually this led to its renaming.\n\nThe Library published a bi-monthly bulletin commencing in November 1946 (and which continued until 1983) drew heavily on the library’s own source material. Another important task during the 1950s and 1960s was the gathering of eyewitness accounts, a resource that was to become a unique and important part of the Library's collection. The accounts were collected systematically by a team of interviewers. In 1964, the Institute of Contemporary History was established and took up the neglected field of modern European history within The Wiener Library.\n\nDuring a funding crisis in 1974, it was decided to move a part of the collection to Tel Aviv. In the course of the preparations for this move, a large part of the collections was microfilmed for conservation purposes. The plans to move the library were abandoned in 1980 after the transports had already begun, resulting in a separate Wiener Library within the library of the University of Tel Aviv that consisted of the majority of the book stock, while The Wiener Library in London retained the microfilmed copies.\n\nToday, The Wiener Holocaust Library is a research library dedicated to studying the Holocaust, comparative genocide studies, Nazi Germany, and German Jewry, and documenting Antisemitism and Neonazism. It is a registered charity under English law. In 2011, it moved from Devonshire Street to new premises in Russell Square.\n\nThe Wiener Holocaust Library has been collecting material related to the Holocaust, its causes and legacies since 1933. Its holdings contain approximately 70,000 books and pamphlets, 2,000 physical document collections, 45,000 photographs and 3,000 periodical titles (including 110 current subscriptions), 1 million press cuttings, as well as posters, objects, artworks, digital collections, and audiovisual materials.\n\nThe Wiener Holocaust Library offers free public access to three temporary exhibitions a year in the ground floor exhibition space, in addition to a number of mini Reading Room exhibitions, travelling exhibitions, and online exhibitions.\n\nSince 2015, the Library has also been the custodian of The Holocaust Explained, an educational website aiming to help British schoolchildren learn about the Nazi era and the Holocaust.\n\nThe website is designed with the British school curriculum for thirteen to eighteen year olds in mind, but it aims to be accessible to other users as well. It covers topics from the historical background of antisemitism through to the legacy of the Holocaust, drawing on the Library’s unique archival materials to illustrate each section. \n\nThe Library also awards the Fraenkel Prize in Contemporary History. This prize, founded by the late Ernst Fraenkel OBE (former Chairman and Joint Library President), is awarded annually for \"outstanding work of twentieth-century history in one of The Wiener Holocaust Library's fields of interest.\" These areas of interest include the following: \"The History of Europe, Jewish History, The Two World Wars, Antisemitism, Comparative Genocide, Political Extremism.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The CLF also offers resources to Unitarian Universalists active in local congregations.\n\nThe CLF provides an outreach ministry, which includes the Church of the Younger Fellowship (a ministry for young adults), the CLF's Military Ministry and a Prison Ministry. The CLF also provides email list communities, discussions, and web-based education materials. CLF members have access to a lending library of books, CDs, videotapes, and sermons; lifespan religious education curricula and self-study guides; and the monthly distribution of sermons and other worship material through its worship publication, Quest. The CLF also podcasts sermons and readings from Quest and offers online courses on its website.\n\nCLF was founded in 1944 as a part of the American Unitarian Association's Extension Department. In 1947, Rev. Dr. Clinton Lee Scott helped organize the Universalist Church of the Larger Fellowship, which was merged with the Unitarian CLF in 1961. The CLF was incorporated in 1970 as an independent congregation, with the same polity as any other congregation in the UUA.\n\nThe CLF Church-on-Loan program provides worship and program materials to small, mostly lay-led UU congregations that enroll in the program.\n\nIn 2005, the Church of the Younger Fellowship (CYF) was established and run by young adults to help connect Unitarian Universalists (ages 18-35).\n\nThe CLF Military Ministry is the newest outreach program for the CLF. Working with UU military chaplains and chaplain candidates, and with the support of the UU Funding Program's Fund for Unitarian Universalism, the CLF created a new website by and for UUs in the military.\n\nThe CLF Ministries to prisoner members provides a Unitarian Universalist church home for incarcerated UUs.\n\nCLF's Letter-Writing Ministry matches CLF prisoner-members with non-incarcerated Unitarian Universalists to exchange letters.\n\n"}

For high blood pressure, it is a less preferred option. It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects include dizziness, sleepiness, swelling, nausea, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain. Severe side effects may include low blood pressure with standing, an irregular heart beat, and priapism. Prostate cancer should be ruled out before starting treatment. It is a α-selective adrenergic blocker in the quinazoline class of compounds.\nDoxazosin was patented in 1977 and came into medical use in 1988. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about £0.50 as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$5.50. In 2017, it was the 150th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions.\n\nDoxazosin is usually added to other antihypertensive therapy such as calcium channel antagonists, diuretics, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-2 receptor blockers.\n\nDoxazosin is generally considered to be safe, well tolerated and effective as an add-on antihypertensive drug.\n\nLike other alpha-1 receptor antagonists, it has a role in the peri-operative management of pheochromocytoma.\n\nDoxazosin is considered to be effective in reducing urinary symptom scores and improving peak urinary flow in men with benign prostatic hypertrophy.\n\nIn March 2000, the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) study stopped its arm of the trial looking at alpha blockers, because doxazosin was less effective than a simple diuretic, and because patients on doxazosin had a 25% higher rate of cardiovascular disease and twice the rate of congestive heart failure as patients on diuretics. Pfizer, aware of the results before publication, launched a marketing campaign in early 2000, and sales were largely unaffected, despite the dangers highlighted by the study.\n\n"}

{"id": "2128011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2128011", "title": "Momentane", "text": "Momentane\n\nIn Finnish grammar, the momentane is a verb aspect indicating that an occurrence is sudden and short-lived.\n\nFinnish has a number of momentane markers; they differ in the valency and voice of the verbs they produce, but all indicate sudden, short-lived occurrences; for example, the verb \"ammahtaa\" (\"to dash ahead suddenly\"; not said of a person) is an anticausative, momentane version of \"ampua\" (\"to shoot\"). Another example is the verb \"katsaista\" (\"to take a quick look\"), which is a momentane version of \"katsoa\" (\"to look\"). For semantic reasons, not all momentane markers can be used with all verbs; for example, an anticausative marker can only be used with verbs representing occurrences that can happen accidentally or on their own. Verbs with momentane markers are considered independent words, and native speakers rarely analyze them, but do synthesize them. Often the parent verb is not in use, leaving only the derived forms such as the momentane.\n\nOften these are combined with a frequentative to indicate a series of short actions. For example, \"heilua\" \"to swing\"; \"heilahtaa\" \"to swing once by itself\"; \"heilahdella\" \"to swing to and fro continuously\". Another note is that the root may not be a fully formed verb, but mere onomatopoeia, e.g. \"pam+auttaa\" \"to bang (something suddenly once)\" or in frequentative form \"pam+autella\" \"to bang (something suddenly multiple times)\".\n\nThe markers are affected by consonant gradation, as illustrated by this pair of first infinitives vs. second-person indicatives: \"pamahtaa\" ~ \"pamahdat\", \"pamauttaa\" ~ \"pamautat\" / \"pamautella\" ~ \"pamauttelet\".\n\n\n"}

A crofter is one who has tenure and use of the land, typically as a tenant farmer, especially in rural areas.\n\nThe word \"croft\" is West Germanic in etymology and is now most familiar in Scotland, most crofts being in the Highlands and Islands area. Elsewhere the expression is generally archaic. In Scottish Gaelic, it is rendered (, plural ).\n\nEssentially similar positions have been the medieval \"villein\" and the Swedish ' and Norwegian '.\n\nThe Scottish croft is a small agricultural landholding of a type which has been subject to special legislation applying to the Highland region of Scotland since 1886. The legislation was largely a response to the complaints and demands of tenant families who were victims of the Highland Clearances. The modern crofters or tenants appear very little in evidence before the beginning of the 18th century. They were tenants at will underneath the tacksman and wadsetters, but practically their tenure was secure enough. The first evidence that can be found of small tenants holding directly of the proprietor is in a rental of the estates of Sir D. MacDonald in Skye and North Uist in 1715.\n\nThe first planned crofting townships in the Outer Hebrides were Barragloum and Kirkibost (Great Bernera) which were laid out into 32 large \"lots\" of between 14 and 30 acres in the uniform rectangular pattern that would become very familiar in later decades. This work was carried out in 1805 by James Chapman for the Earl of Seaforth.\n\nThe first edition of the Ordnance Survey in 1850 clearly highlights the division of this land and the turf and stone boundaries built by the first tenants in 1805 are still in use today as croft boundaries. Kirkibost was 'cleared' of its tenants in 1823 and the 1850 mapping clearly shows roofless ruins on each parcel of land. The township was however re-settled in 1878 following the Bernera Riot four years earlier using exactly the same division boundaries set out in 1805.\n\nThe Parliament of the United Kingdom created the Crofters' Act 1886, after the Highland Land League had gained seats in that parliament. The government was then Liberal, with William Ewart Gladstone as Prime Minister. Another Crofters' Act was created in 1993 (the Crofters' (Scotland) Act 1993). The earlier Act established the first Crofting Commission, but its responsibilities were quite different from those of the newer Crofters Commission created in 1955. The Commission is based in Inverness.\n\nCrofts held subject to the provisions of the Crofters' Acts are in the administrative counties of Shetland, Orkney, Caithness, Sutherland, Ross-shire, Inverness-shire and Argyll, in the north and west of Scotland. Under the 1886 legislation (the Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act) protected crofters are members of a crofters' township, consisting of tenants of neighbouring crofts with a shared right to use common pasture. Since 1976 it has been legally possible for a crofter to acquire title to his croft, thus becoming an owner-occupier.\n\nThe Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 gives crofters the right to buy their land.\n\n\n\nArticles\n"}

Its total length is about , of which the first are in Greece, and the remaining are in Albania. Its drainage basin is and its average discharge is . It is fed by several tributaries, such as the Voidomatis, Sarantaporos, Drino and Shushicë.\n\nThe Aoös' source is in Greece, specifically in the Pindus mountains in Epirus, near the village of Vovousa. An artificial lake has been constructed at an altitude of 1350 meters, and there is a hydroelectric dam in place since 1987. It flows through the Vikos–Aoös National Park, where it forms towering canyons and then flows through the town of Konitsa, where it is joined by the Voidomatis. It enters Albania near Çarshovë, where it is joined by the Sarantaporos. and then continues northwest through Përmet, Këlcyrë, Tepelenë (where it is joined by the Drino), Memaliaj, Selenicë and Novoselë. It then flows into the Adriatic Sea, northwest of Vlorë; mouth of the river is situated within the boundaries of the Vjosa-Narta Protected Landscape.\n\nThe river is known by a number of different names. In antiquity it was called Aoös () in Greek, and Aous in Latin. In Albanian it is called Vjosë or Vjosa, while in Greece it is known by its ancient name (Αώος in modern orthography), as well as Vovousa (Βοβούσα) or Aias (Αίας, Αἴας). In Aromanian it is Băiasa. Local Macedonian name is Vojusha (\"Vojuša/Војуша\").\n\nIn Greek mythology, Aous is an epithet or name of Adonis. Aous was also the name of the first king of Cyprus. A river and a mountain in Cyprus were also named Aous.\n\nHecataeus (550–476 BC) refers to the river as Aias (), the name Anios () is used by Plutarch in Caesar, while Polybius, Livy and Strabo use the term Aoös. The Thesprotian tribe of Parauaioi received their name from the river, as those living beside it. Pausanias writes of \"sharks\" () in the river, as it flows through Thesprotia. It is mentioned as Avos () by Stephanus of Byzantium in the 6th century AD.\n\nIn 274 BC Pyrrhus of Epirus defeated Antigonus II Gonatas near the river's banks. In 198 BC, Philip V of Macedon and the Roman Titus Quinctius Flamininus, clashed in the Battle of the Aous. In 170 BC a plot to kidnap Aulus Hostilius Mancinus was foiled by Molossians by mistake. In antiquity the river passed more to the north, towards where Fier nowadays lies. Owing to an earthquake in the 4th century, it changed to the present course. This earthquake and river change were the main reasons that led to the decline of the ancient Greek city of Apollonia.\n\nThe \"Vikos–Aoös National Park\" ( \"Ethnikós Drymós Víkou–Aóou\"), founded in 1973 is a national park in the region of Epirus in northwestern Greece. The national park encompasses of mountainous terrain, with numerous rivers, lakes, caves, deep canyons and dense coniferous and deciduous forest. The core of the park (3400 hectares) is the Vikos Gorge, carved by the Voidomatis river, while the Aoos gorge, mount Tymfi, with its highest peak Gamila and a number of traditionally preserved settlements form the park's peripheral zone.\n\nSince a decade or so, a 90 MW power plant at Kalivaç is under construction, but with no progress lately. The hydropower additional potential of the river is being studied by the Albanian Government. Seven additional hydroelectric power plants along the Albanian part of the river would have 400 MW total capacity (2,155 GWh/year). The feasibility of the project is being studied but strongly denied by environmental groups like River Watch and EcoAlbania, which urge authorities to halt such plans and declare it a national park. In February 2005 The Albanian Government approved a law, making the Vjose-Narte wetlands a protected area. This legislation followed Albania's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol in December 2004. The river is known for its apport to the important irrigation canal Vjosë-Levan-Fier, a canal that was built in the 1950s for the irrigation of the Myzeqe low plains.\n\n\"Vjosa\" is a common female Albanian given name.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the first to feature their new bassist, C.J. Ramone, who replaced departed member Dee Dee Ramone. The album was re-released in the UK by the Captain Oi! record label on August 10, 2004, with the band's cover of the \"Spider-Man\" theme song included as a bonus track.\n\n\"Mondo Bizarro\" was the Ramones' first studio album in three years, after the band left Sire Records for a new contract with Radioactive Records. The title was taken from the film of the same name, a 1966 sequel to the film \"Mondo Cane\".\n\nAlthough Dee Dee Ramone had left the band, he provided the songs \"Poison Heart,\" \"Main Man\" and \"Strength to Endure\" as compensation for the band bailing him out of jail due to problems with his long drug addiction. \"Poison Heart\" and \"Strength to Endure\" were released as the album's singles, in June and October 1992, respectively.\n\nIn a 1992 interview for an Argentinian newspaper, Johnny Ramone said of the album, \"Generally I always find two or three songs that I hate. From \"Mondo Bizarro\", I really like almost all the songs and I am very satisfied with the result.\" However, when he was interviewed about the album for the 2003 documentary \"\", he stated, \"I don't like it. I don't like it at all.\" In Johnny's 2012 autobiography, \"Commando\", he awarded the album (along with its predecessor, 1989's \"Brain Drain\") a \"C\" grade, stating, \"The songs are the weak spots on the album. [...] C.J. was in the band, but his writing wasn't up to par yet.\"\n\nThe album was certified gold in Brazil in 2001.\n\nThe song \"Censorshit\" was written by Joey Ramone about how rock and rap albums were being censored by the Parents Music Resource Center, a group of politicians' wives who sought to put parental advisory warning labels on records, a practice which has since become standard. It has a reference to Ozzy Osbourne and Frank Zappa in the line, \"Ask Ozzy, Zappa, or me, we'll show you what it's like to be free.\" The song is addressed to Tipper Gore, who was the wife of then-Tennessee Senator and eventual Vice President of the United States, Al Gore. In his book \"Commando\", Johnny Ramone stated that he \"didn't like the lyrics on 'Censorshit.' It was stupid. I liked the song, though. Joey wrote this song about Vice President Al Gore's wife, Tipper Gore, then he went on and voted for Bill Clinton.\"\n\n\"Heidi Is a Headcase\" was written by Joey Ramone and Daniel Rey. According to an interview on the podcast \"Ramones of the Day,\" C.J. Ramone stated that the song is about a girl named Heidi who both Joey and C.J. dated for a period of time.\n\n\"Take It as It Comes\" is a cover song, originally recorded by The Doors for their 1967 debut album. The 2004 CD reissue bonus track, \"Spider-Man,\" is a cover of the theme song from the original \"Spider-Man\" animated series. It was originally released as an unlisted bonus track on initial releases of the Ramones' 1995 album \"¡Adios Amigos!\" (omitted on later editions), and a slightly different version was available on the 1995 various artists compilation album \"\".\n\nRamones\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nAdditional personnel\n"}
{"id": "2128068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2128068", "title": "Information flow (information theory)", "text": "Information flow (information theory)\n\nInformation flow in an information theoretical context is the transfer of information from a variable formula_1 to a variable formula_2 in a given process. Not all flows may be desirable; for example, a system should not leak any secret (partially or not) to public observers.\n\nSecuring the data manipulated by computing systems has been a challenge in the past years. Several methods to limit the information disclosure exist today, such as access control lists, firewalls, and cryptography. However, although these methods do impose limits on the information that is released by a system, they provide no guarantees about information \"propagation\". For example, access control lists of file systems prevent unauthorized file access, but they do not control how the data is used afterwards. Similarly, cryptography provides a means to exchange information privately across a non-secure channel, but no\nguarantees about the confidentiality of the data are given once it is decrypted.\n\nIn low level information flow analysis, each variable is usually assigned a security level. The basic model comprises two distinct levels: low and high, meaning, respectively, publicly observable information, and secret information. To ensure confidentiality, flowing information from high to low variables should not be allowed. On the other hand, to ensure integrity, flows to high variables should be restricted.\n\nMore generally, the security levels can be viewed as a lattice with information flowing only upwards in the lattice.\n\nFor example, considering two security levels formula_3 and formula_4 (low and high), if formula_5, flows from formula_3 to formula_3, from formula_4 to formula_4, and formula_3 to formula_4 would be allowed, while flows from formula_4 to formula_3 would not.\n\nThroughout this article, the following notation is used:\n\nWhere formula_3 and formula_4 are the only two security levels in the lattice being considered.\n\nInformation flows can be divided in two major categories. The simplest one is explicit flow, where some secret is explicitly leaked to a publicly observable variable. In the following example, the secret in the variable \"h\" flows into the publicly observable variable \"l\".\n\nThe other flows fall into the side channel category. For example, in the timing attack or in the power analysis attack, the system leaks information through, respectively, the time or power it takes to perform an action depending on a secret value.\n\nIn the following example, the attacker can deduce if the value of \"h\" is one or not by the time the program takes to finish:\n\nAnother side channel flow is the implicit information flow, which consists in leakage of information through the program control flow. The following program (implicitly) discloses the value of the secret variable \"h\" to the variable \"l\". In this case, since the \"h\" variable is boolean, all the bits of the variable of \"h\" is disclosed (at the end of the program, \"l\" will be 3 if \"h\" is true, and 42 otherwise).\n\nNon-interference is a policy that enforces that an attacker should not be able to distinguish two computations from their outputs if they only vary in their secret inputs.\nHowever, this policy is too strict to be usable in realistic programs. The classic example is a password checker program that, in order to be useful, needs to disclose some secret information: whether the input password is correct or not (note that the information that an attacker learns in case the program \"rejects\" the password is that the attempted password is \"not\" the valid one).\n\nA mechanism for \"information flow control\" is one that enforces information flow policies. Several methods to enforce information flow policies have been proposed. Run-time mechanisms that tag data with information flow labels have been employed at the operating system level and at the programming language level. Static program analyses have also been developed that ensure information flows within programs are in accordance with policies.\n\nBoth static and dynamic analysis for current programming languages have been developed. However, dynamic analysis techniques cannot observe all execution paths, and therefore cannot be both sound and precise. In order to guarantee noninterference, they either terminate executions that might release sensitive information or they ignore updates that might leak information.\n\nA prominent way to enforce information flow policies in a program is through a security type system: that is, a type system that enforces security properties. In such a sound type system, if a program type-checks, it meets the flow policy and therefore contains no improper information flows.\n\nIn a programming language augmented with a security type system every expression carries both a type (such as boolean, or integer) and a security label.\n\nFollowing is a simple security type system from that enforces non-interference.\nThe notation formula_18 means that the expression formula_19 has type formula_20. Similarly, formula_21 means that the command formula_22 is typable in the security context formula_23.\n\nformula_24\n\nformula_25\n\nformula_26\n\nformula_27\n\nWell-typed commands include, for example,\n\nConversely, the program\nis ill-typed, as it will disclose the value of variable formula_30 into formula_31.\n\nNote that the rule formula_32 is a subsumption rule, which means that any command that is of security type formula_33 can also be formula_34. For example, formula_35 can be both formula_33 and formula_34. This is called polymorphism in type theory. Similarly, the type of an expression formula_19 that satisfies formula_39 can be both formula_33 and formula_34 according to formula_42 and formula_43 respectively.\n\nAs shown previously, non-interference policy is too strict for use in most real-world applications. Therefore, several approaches to allow controlled releases of information have been devised. Such approaches are called information declassification.\n\nRobust declassification requires that an active attacker may not manipulate the system in order to learn more secrets than what passive attackers already know.\n\nInformation declassification constructs can be classified in four orthogonal dimensions: \"What\" information is released, \"Who\" is authorized to access the information, \"Where\" the information is released, and \"When\" is the information released.\n\nA \"what\" declassification policy controls which information (partial or not) may be released to a publicly observable variable.\n\nThe following code example shows a declassify construct from. In this code, the value of the variable \"h\" is explicitly allowed by the programmer to flow into the publicly observable variable \"l\".\n\nA \"who\" declassification policy controls which principals (i.e., who) can access a given piece of information. This kind of policy has been implemented in the Jif compiler.\n\nThe following example allows Bob to share its secret contained in the variable \"b\" with Alice through the commonly accessible variable \"ab\".\n\nA \"where\" declassification policy regulates where the information can be released, for example, by controlling in which lines of the source code information can be released.\n\nThe following example makes use of the flow construct proposed in. This construct takes a flow policy (in this case, variables in H are allowed to flow to variables in L) and a command, which is run under the given flow policy.\n\nA \"when\" declassification policy regulates when the information can be released. Policies of this kind can be used to verify programs that implement, for example, controlled release of secret information after payment, or encrypted secrets which should not be released in a certain time given polynomial computational power.\n\nAn implicit flow occurs when code whose conditional execution is based on private information updates a public variable. This is especially problematic when multiple executions are considered since an attacker could leverage the public variable to infer private information by observing how its value changes over time or with the input.\n\nThe naïve approach consists on enforcing the confidentiality property on all variables whose value is affected by other variables. This method leads to partially leaked information due to on some instances of the application a variable is Low and in others High.\n\nNo sensitive upgrade halts the program whenever a High variable affects the value of a Low variable effectively preventing information leakage. Since it simply looks for expressions where an information leakage might happen without looking at the context it may halt a program that despite having potential information leakage it never actually leaks information.\n\nIn the following example x is High and y is Low.\n\nIn this case the program would be halted since it uses the value of a High variable to change a Low variable despite the program never leaking information.\n\nPermissive-upgrade introduces an extra security class P which will identify information leaking variables. When a High variable affects the value of a Low variable, the latter is labeled P. If a P labeled variable affects a Low variable the program would be halted. \nTo prevent the halting the Low and P variables should be converted to High using a privatization function to ensure no information leakage can occur. On subsequent instances the program will run without interruption.\n\nPrivatization inference extends permissive upgrade to automatically apply the privatization function to any variable that might leak information. \nThis method should be used during testing where it will convert most variables. Once the program moves into production the permissive-upgrade should be used to halt the program in case of an information leakage and the privatization functions can be updated to prevent subsequent leaks.\n\nBeyond applications to programming language, information flow control theories have been applied to OS, Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing.\n"}

Johnson invented the style in 1992 to enhance birthday party clown acts, thereby creating the concept of \"hip-hop clowns\". Johnson and his followers have performed at birthday parties ranging from inner city communities to celebrities like Madonna, Pamela Anderson, and Cedric the Entertainer. He achieved international acclaim as focus of David LaChapelle's 2005 documentary \"Rize\". Tommy the Clown also danced with Ray Ray, of Mindless Behavior fame.\n\nThomas Johnson was born in Detroit, Michigan, and was raised in South Central Los Angeles, California. Growing up, he, as did many of his friends and neighbors in the community, often found himself falling in and out of trouble. After Johnson spent five years in jail he realized that his lifestyle needed a significant change. He acquired a job as a typist clerk until 1992 when he received his first opportunity to perform; a co-worker asked him to be a clown at her child's birthday celebration because of his entertaining personality. He accepted the job, thus creating his Tommy the Clown persona. After this event, Tommy the Clown led the way in the stirring dance movement called \"Clowning\". He also developed this form of dance in response to the 1992 Rodney King riots. \".\n\nTommy's performances incorporated the current music and dancing of the time, and he encouraged the children to get up and dance with him. He soon developed loyal followers throughout Los Angeles. He used this opportunity to give children the chance to take an interest in dancing rather than drugs or gang activity and established a dance crew called the Hip Hop Clowns who performed with him at parties. His only rules for his crew were as follows: \"No gangs, No drugs, Do well in school (grades, attendance and behavior) and be a role model by living a positive lifestyle at all times.\"\n\nBy 2000, there were over 60 clown crews in Los Angeles. To avoid a clashing of these different groups, Tommy took it upon himself to hold weekly dance battles at his former Tommy the Clown Academy, where an audience judged who was best. The popularity of these contests flourished, and Tommy created and hosted the Battle Zone event—an official dance battle featuring community dancers and celebrity guests. Tommy's dance phenomenon caught the attention of the acclaimed director and photographer, David LaChapelle. Feeling inclined to capture this movement on film, LaChapelle directed the 2005 Lions Gate Films documentary \"Rize\".\n\nSince then, Tommy the Clown and the Hip Hop Clowns have been traveling the globe performing and making appearances to spread the movement, as well as performing for various celebrities. Tommy has also appeared at numerous schools and colleges across the United States. He has a partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District to provide an in-school Clowning and Krumping workshop based on the California Education Standards. He also provides a variety of youth programs in schools and the community.\n\n"}

The first remains were described in 1999 based on several skeletal elements uncovered in the three years preceding. \"A. garhi\" was originally considered to have been a direct ancestor to \"Homo\" and the human line, but could also have been an offshoot. Like other australopithecines, \"A. garhi\" had a brain volume of ; a jaw which jutted out (prognathism); relatively large molars and premolars; adaptations for both walking on two legs (bipedalism) and grasping while climbing (arboreality); and it is possible that, though unclear if, males were larger than females (exhibited sexual dimorphism). One individual, presumed female based on size, may have been tall.\n\n\"A. garhi\" may be the first pre-\"Homo\" hominin found to have manufactured tools—using them in butchering—and is counted among a growing body of evidence for pre-\"Homo\" stone tool industries (the ability to manufacture tools was previously believed to have separated \"Homo\" from predecessors.) \"A. garhi\" possibly produced the Oldowan industry which was previously considered to have been invented by the later \"H. habilis\".\n\nThe Ethiopian \"Australopithecus garhi\" was first described in 1999 by palaeoanthropologists Berhane Asfaw, Tim D. White, Owen Lovejoy, Bruce Latimer, Scott Simpson, and Gen Suwa based on fossils discovered in the Hatayae Beds of the Bouri Formation in Middle Awash, Afar Region, Ethiopia. The first hominin remains were discovered here in 1990—a partial parietal bone (GAM-VP-1/2), left jawbone (GAM-VP-1/1), and left humerus (MAT-VP-1/1)—which are unassignable to a specific genus. The first identifiable \"Australopithecus\" fossils–an adult ulna (BOU-VP-11/1)–were found on 17 November 1996 by T. Assebework. A partial skeleton (BOU-VP-12/1) was discovered 13 days later by White, comprising a mostly complete left femur, right humerus, radius, and ulna, and a partial fibula, foot, and jawbone. The holotype specimen, a partial skull (BOU-VP-12/130), was discovered on 20 November 1997 by Ethiopian palaeoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie. More skull fragments (BOU-VP-12/87) were recovered south of BOU-VP-12/1. On 17 November 1997, French palaeoanthropologist Alban Defleur discovered a complete mandible (BOU-VP-17/1) about north in the Esa Dibo locality of the formation, and American palaeoanthropologist David DeGusta discovered a humerus (BOU-VP-35/1) north of BOU-VP-17/1. However, BOU-VP-11, -12, and -35 cannot conclusively be attributed to \"A. garhi\".\n\nThe remains are dated to about 2.5 million years ago (mya) based on argon–argon dating. When they were discovered, human evolution was obscured due to a paucity of remains from 3 to 2 mya, with the only hominins from this timespan being identified from South Africa (\"A. africanus\") and Lake Turkana, Kenya (\"Paranthropus aethiopicus\"). Likewise, the classification of australopithecines and pre-\"Homo erectus\" hominins has been the subject of much debate. The original describers considered \"A. garhi\" to be a descendent of the earlier \"A. afarensis\" which inhabited the same region, based mainly on dental similarities. Though they assigned the species to \"Australopithecus\", the original describers believed it could represent an ancestor to \"Homo\", which, if the case, would possibly lead to reclassification as \"H. garhi\". Because the characteristics of \"A. garhi\" are unexpected for a human ancestor at this stage, the species name, \"garhi\", means \"surprise\" in the local Afar language. In 1999, American palaeoanthropologists David Strait and Frederick E. Grine concluded that \"A. garhi\" was instead an offshoot of the human line instead of an ancestor because \"A. garhi\" and \"Homo\" share no synapomorphies (traits unique to only them).\n\nLike other australopithecines, \"A. garhi\" had a brain volume of about , a sagittal crest running along the midline of the skull, and a prognathic jaw (the jaw jutted out). Relatively, the postcanine teeth, the molars and premolars, are massive (post-canine megadontia), similar to or greater than those of other australopithecines and of the large-toothed \"Paranthropus robustus\". The large teeth of \"Australopithecus\" species have historically been interpreted as having been adaptations for a diet of hard foods, but the durable teeth may instead have only served an important function during leaner times for harder fallback foods. That is, dental anatomy may not accurately portray normal \"Australopithecus\" diet, rather abnormal diet during times of famine.\n\nLike the earlier \"A. afarensis\" from the same region, \"A. garhi\" had a humanlike humerus to femur ratio, and an apelike brachial index (lower to upper arm ratio) as well as curved phalanges of the hand. This is generally interpreted as adaptations for both walking on two legs (habitual bipedalism) as well as for grasping while climbing in trees (arboreality).\n\nThe BOU-VP-35/1 humerus specimen is notably larger than the humerus of the BOU-VP-12/1 specimen, which could potentially indicate size-specific sexual dimorphism with males larger than females to a similar degree to what is postulated in \"A. afarensis\", but it is unclear if this does not represent normal size variation of the same sex as this is based on only two specimens. Nonetheless, on the basis of size, BOU-VP-12/130 is considered male and BOU-VP-17/1 female. Contemporary hominins from Kenya are about the same size as \"A. garhi\". BOU-VP-17/1 may have been about tall.\n\n\"Australopithecus\" are thought to have had fast, apelike growth rates, lacking an extended childhood typical of modern humans. However, the legs of \"A. garhi\" are elongated, unlike those of other \"Australopithecus\", and, in humans, elongated limbs develop during the delayed adolescent growth spurt. This could mean that \"A. garhi\", compared to other \"Australopithecus\", either had a slower overall growth rate, or a more rapid leg growth rate.\n\nIt was previously believed that only \"Homo\" could manufacture tools, but mammalian bones associated with the \"A. garhi\" remains exhibit cut and percussion marks made from stone tools: the left mandible of an alcelaphine bovid with three successive, unambiguous cut marks presumably made while removing the tongue; a bovid tibia with cut marks, chop marks, and impact scars from a hammerstone, possibly inflicted to harvest the bone marrow; and a \"Hipparion\" (a horse) femur with cut marks consistent with dismemberment and filleting. However, it is unclear why no stone tools were recovered from this site. Because the Hatayae locality was likely a featureless, grassy lake margin with so few raw materials for making stone tools, it is possible these hominins were creating and carrying tools some ways with them to butchering sites, intending to use them many times times before discarding.\n\nAt the nearby Gona site, where there is an abundance of raw materials, several Oldowan tools (an industry previously believed to have been invented by \"H. habilis\") were recovered from 1992–1994. The tools date to around 2.6–2.5 mya, the oldest evidence of manufacturing at the time, and since \"A. garhi\" was the only species identified in the vicinity at the time, this species was the best candidate for authorship. However, in 2015, the earliest remains of \"Homo\" were discovered in Ledi-Geraru, also in the Afar Region, dating to 2.8–2.75 mya. More stone tools were found in 2019 dating to about 2.6 mya in Ledi-Geraru, predating the Gona artifacts, and these may be attributed to \"Homo\". Nonetheless, other australopithecines have been associated with stone tool manufacturing, such as the 2010 discovery of cut marks dating to 3.4 mya attributed to \"A. afarensis\", and the 2015 discovery of the Lomekwi culture from Lake Turkana dating to 3.3 mya possibly attributed to \"Kenyanthropus\".\n\n"}

More than a hundred markets have taken the \"Eyewitness News\" name to label their own featured local newscasts and others are using Primo's concept under different names for their own formats. \"\"Eyewitness News\" was the first newscast to put [news] reporters on the set,\" which Primo states in his biographical book, Eyewitness Newsman . The New York Daily News described Primo as the man \"who almost single-handedly changed the face of broadcast journalism.\" Station newscasts were only 15 minutes long and he supervised the transition to thirty minute programs. As part of the expansion, Marie Torre, of the New York Herald Tribune was hired. Primo trained her and she became one of the first women in broadcasting to write, report, and anchor a newscast.\n\nPrimo was born July 3, 1935, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended North Catholic Boys School and Perry High School, graduating in 1953, the University of Pittsburgh and graduated in 1958.\n\nHe began in the business in 1953 as a mail boy at WDTV in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, moving up the ranks as the station switched dial positions (from channel 3 to channel 2), owners (from the DuMont Television Network to Westinghouse Broadcasting) and call letters (to KDKA-TV), working as news writer, cameraman, reporter, and anchorman. In February 1963, Primo was named assistant news director of KDKA-TV.\n\nPrimo moved from KDKA-TV to KYW-TV in Cleveland, Ohio to become the news director there in 1964. While in Cleveland, Primo hired Tom Snyder when the previous anchor, Jim Axel, left. When Westinghouse switched their Cleveland station for NBC's WRCV in Philadelphia in 1965, Primo moved to Philadelphia.\n\nIt was in Philadelphia where Primo launched the \"Eyewitness News\" format (the name itself had been used for some years before that by Westinghouse's TV stations for its local newscasts, and in fact was first used by KYW itself in 1959 when it was based in Cleveland, Ohio). \n\nIn September 1968 he moved to WABC-TV, the ABC affiliate in New York City, to become director of news there. He refined the \"Eyewitness News\" format at WABC, hiring minority and women reporters whom he placed in prominent positions in the newscast (including the addition of \"on-camera exchanges between anchors and on-set reporters, which Chicago-based media critic Morry Roth dubbed \"happy talk\" when the format was introduced on WLS-TV's newscast), and the Eyewitness News name and format radiated across the United States from here.\n\nHe also chose the musical score from the Tar Sequence in the movie \"Cool Hand Luke\" (composed by Lalo Schifrin) as the news theme to WABC's \"Eyewitness News\", a move which also exposed many other TV stations in the United States (and by extension, their viewers) to Schifrin's work.\n\nAt WABC-TV, Primo assembled the legendary anchor duo of Roger Grimsby and Bill Beutel, which garnered high ratings for 16 years until 1986, when Grimsby was let go from the station.\n\nPrimo was made vice president in charge of news for ABC's owned and operated stations in May 1972.\n\nIn February 1973, ABC launched a half-hour newsmagazine, \"The Reasoner Report\", featuring veteran newsman Harry Reasoner as anchor. When executive producer Ernest Leiser left \"The Reasoner Report\" to become executive producer of \"ABC Evening News\" (which Reasoner also anchored), Primo was brought in to replace him.\n\nThe Reasoner Report was cancelled in May 1975, and Primo left the network the following year to become a consultant.\n\nIn 1999, Primo worked with Jonathan Braun to launch foreigntv.com, a web site which featured streaming broadcasts from international news, hiring Peter Arnett as an international correspondent. The following year, foreigntv.com, Inc. became Medium4.com, launching three additional web sites: StreamingUSA.com, NicheTV.com and Medium4Music.com.\n\nIn 2002, Primo launched Teen Kids News as a project to give young people an opportunity to develop an interest in the news industry through delivering news and information to their peers. The program is starting its 15th year, seen on 220 TV stations covering 95% of USA, 1000 locations in 175 countries via American Forces Network and sent by PBS satellite and streamed on Internet to 12,600 schools each week.\n\n\n\n"}

It is their most musically adventurous release, but also their least commercially successful, and last studio album to feature singer Michael Kiske and original drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg.\n\nTensions within the band and its management resulted in an album that is highly eclectic in terms of its musical aesthetics, to the point that it has been rejected by the band's core audience as not being a Helloween album at all. This position is based on the notion that Helloween (arguably) created but, more importantly, had perfected the power metal sound.\n\nHaving failed to live up to the standard of \"\" and \"\" after \"Pink Bubbles Go Ape\" in commercial (and somewhat artistic) terms, \"Chameleon\" abandoned almost all elements of the power metal sound that the band had been instrumental in creating, and can be seen as an attempt to garner success in wider musical avenues like synthesizers, horns, acoustic guitars, the children's chorus of the Orchester Johann Sebastian Bach, violin, church organ, country music, grunge and swing, with participation of musicians like Stefan Pintev and Axel Bergstedt. The atmosphere of the album is closer to progressive rock, with some pop elements. While some of these elements may have always been a part of Helloween's sound, they were not in the forefront of their sound and were not the elements most celebrated by the bands core heavy metal audience. The song \"Giants\" has more power metal elements than any other song on the album. \"Chameleon\" was the only time these diverse influences would make it to the front of the band's sound. In terms of production, this is arguably the most accomplished album of the Michael Kiske era, well produced with an epic sound full of different stylistic influences. The name \"Chameleon\" is derived from the style change from song to song (as a chameleon changes color).\n\nThe album contains four singles: \"Windmill\", \"When the Sinner\", \"Step Out of Hell\", and \"I Don't Wanna Cry No More\".\n\nThe album was a failure both critically and commercially, and vocalist Michael Kiske and drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg were fired after the subsequent promotional tour. The band then recruited vocalist Andi Deris from Pink Cream 69 along with drummer Uli Kusch and continued in a direction more akin to their earlier works.\n\n\n\n\nIt is an interesting footmark, that three of the children of the children's choir are Aminata, Jazz and Sophie from Black Buddafly, who had been 12 and 13 years old, when they sang for Chameleon.\n\n"}

Premiering on January 6, 1975, the show never found an audience against \"Today\" or the CBS combo of the \"CBS Morning News\" and \"Captain Kangaroo\". Lasting just under ten months, its final installment aired on October 31.\n\nThe program's concept was based on \"Ralph Story's AM\", the local morning show on the network's owned-and-operated Los Angeles station KABC-TV. Like \"Today\", \"AM America\" employed two hosts and a news anchor. Originally selected in August 1974 as cohosts were Bill Beutel who was co-anchor of \"Eyewitness News\" on the network's New York City flagship station WABC-TV, Stephanie Edwards from \"Ralph Story's AM\" and Bob Kennedy who hosted morning talk show \"Kennedy and Company\" on Chicago's WLS-TV. Kennedy died of bone cancer on November 5, 1974, just two months prior to the series' debut, and was eventually replaced by ABC's Washington correspondent Peter Jennings who provided the news reports.\n\nOne notable episode of \"AM America\" aired on April 25, 1975, when members of the British comedy troupe Monty Python (with the exception of John Cleese, who had temporarily left the group) made one of their earliest appearances on American television. (The program ended with the Pythons attempting to tear apart the set and abscond with everything that wasn't nailed down, including Edwards.)\n\nEdwards quit the show by the end of May, and Beutel followed her out a few months later. On November 3, the Monday following its final broadcast, it was replaced with a more well-known, more successful effort, \"Good Morning America\".\n\nThe logo for AM America had the letters A and M colored in blue while the rest of the word \"America\" was colored in red. The \"AM\" overlapped with \"America\". Also, a star was placed inside the \"A\".\n\nThe series' theme music was \"Spirit Of '76 (AM America),\" an instrumental composed by William Goldstein which was released as a single for Motown in November 1975.\n\nThe \"AM (city name)\" name was franchised to ABC stations across the United States, for locally produced morning talk programs (which generally aired during the 9 a.m. hour, after the national program ended). \"AM Los Angeles\", the successor to \"Ralph Story's AM\", featured Regis Philbin and Sarah Purcell. Purcell was replaced by Cyndy Garvey in 1978, and the show moved to New York City in 1983 (where it replaced \"AM New York\"), eventually evolving into the current \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\". WLS-TV's \"AM Chicago\" (itself a successor to the \"Kennedy and Company\" series hosted by Bob Kennedy, who would have been an AM America co-host prior to his unexpected death), hosted by Oprah Winfrey, evolved into \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in 1986. \"AM Buffalo\", which replaced a \"Dialing for Dollars\" franchise on WKBW-TV, also remains on air. Additionally, KATU in Portland has aired \"AM Northwest\" since the debut of \"AM America\". There also was a short lived \"AM Northwest\" program on Seattle's KOMO-TV (sister station to KATU) in either the 1980s or 1990s. The KATU and KOMO-TV versions had different hosts and guests, but the debut broadcast on KOMO included on air interaction with the hosts at \"AM Northwest\" in Portland.\n"}

Historically it was one of the hamlets or \"ends\" scattered across the parish of Kempston. It is served by Kempston Hardwick railway station on the Marston Vale Line, which was one of the least-used stations in the UK railway network.\n\nFor many years Kempston Hardwick was technically part of Kempston town. This is a consequence of the division of the old larger Kempston parish in 1896 into Kempston town and Kempston Rural. However, modern boundary changes have meant that Kempston Hardwick is now part of the rural parish of Stewartby (where the 2011 Census population was included).\n\nHardwick Preceptory was a priory of the Knights Hospitaller from 1279 to 1489. The first mention of this property occurs in 1279. In 1287, and 1330, the Prior claimed to hold a view of frankpledge from four tenants in Kempston. In 1338, this estate comprised a messuage with a garden worth 4s. per annum, a dovehouse valued at 3s. 4d., a water-mill 26s. 8d., 370 acres of land worth £6 3s. 4d., 32 acres meadow worth 44s., 8 acres of pasture worth 8s., and pasture for 200 oxen worth 20s.

Stephen Holliday has served as Headmaster since 2000, having succeeded Dr Richard Gliddon. The Queen is the School's patron, although QEH is named after its original patron Queen Elizabeth I. \n\nKnown traditionally as \"The City School\", Queen Elizabeth's Hospital was founded by the will of affluent merchant John Carr in 1586, gaining its first Royal Charter in 1590. The school accepts boys from ages 7 to 18 and, since September 2017, girls aged 16 to 18 into the co-educational Sixth Form.\n\nThe school began as a boarding school, accepting 'day boys' for the first time in the early 1920s. Boarders continued to wear the traditional blue coat uniform on a daily basis until the 1980s. After that, it was only worn on special occasions. Following a steady decline in numbers QEH stopped accepting new boarders in 2004, and boarding closed completely in July 2008.\n\nA Junior School opened in September 2007 in terraced Georgian town houses in Upper Berkeley Place, adjacent to the main school.\n\nThe school is located in central Bristol, near Cabot Tower, in a building built of Brandon stone, designed by local architects Foster and Son and dating from 1847. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building. The terrace steps and walls are also grade II listed, as are the walls, lodge and gates. Before moving to the site on Brandon Hill, it was previously housed at Gaunt's Hospital mansion house, Unity Street (1590–1767) and St. Bartholomew's, Christmas Steps (1767–1847). QEH has had close associations with Redmaids' High School since the latter's founding in 1634.\n\nTo celebrate 425 years since the school's opening, a new school song was composed in 2015.\n\nFor much of its history, QEH has provided education for boys aged 11 to 18, although it now has an all-boys junior school from age 7 as well. In 2014 QEH began working with Redland High School on a co-educational infant school from age 2 to 7 years. Since September 2017, the Sixth Form has been co-educational. QEH Senior School has an entrance examination in January for students entering at Year 7 and Year 9 levels, boys take papers in Maths, English, Verbal Reasoning and Non Verbal Reasoning. These papers are used to select those eligible for John Carr academic scholarships. Boys applying for Music scholarships are invited to an interview and audition, at which they perform music and complete an aural and sight reading test. Sports scholarships are awarded based on an interview and practical tasks. The Year 7 entrants are generally chosen by around Easter and attend an initiation day during the summer term. Boys and girls also regularly enter the school at Sixth Form level, including international students. \n\nThe school has three ICT suites and several sets of laptops, and most classrooms contain Smart Boards. Boys are given a school email address and can connect to the school network from home to access files and other resources.\n\nThe school library, located at the top of the main building, contains more than 10,000 books and takes 35 periodicals, including magazines and national newspapers. Pupil librarians help to run the library and the role of Head Librarian is given to a student in the Upper Sixth.\n\nThe school possesses 23 acres of playing fields outside Bristol, near the village of Failand, which are managed in partnership with Bristol City F.C., who use the land for training.\n\nThe Sixth Form centre includes its own IT suite, communal study area and common room, with a cafeteria serving hot and cold food at break and lunchtimes.\n\nThey have recently opened a new £3.5million ceramic and science block and have recently completed a £2.5 million redevelopment of their playing fields near Failand.\n\nThe school day begins at 08:35 am with registration in each class's form room. This is followed on Mondays by a full school assembly in the dining hall led by the Headmaster. The day is divided into nine 35-minute periods. The first two are from 9–10:10 am, followed by a 20-minute break, then four more periods, before lunch starts at 12:50 pm and ends at 2:05 pm. After three more lessons, at 4:00 pm the school day ends.\n\nAll boys have one afternoon of sports per week. For years 7 and 8, it takes place on Wednesdays at the school's Failand playing fields, where rugby is played during the autumn and spring terms, and cricket or athletics during the summer. Years 9 and 10 have games on Tuesdays, and are given a choice of sports, while year 11 and sixth form have games on Thursdays. There are also gym periods for years 7–11 during the rest of the week.\n\nIn year 7, boys are taught Latin, English, Spanish, maths, geography, history, religious studies, Art, biology, physics and chemistry, as well as periods for sport. In year 8, boys are taught all of the above as well as an extra language (German or French). In year 9, boys must choose two creative subjects (design technology, information technology, art, drama, music or Latin, the latter occupying both choices), which are each taught once a week for a double period. Boys are expected to take up to ten GCSEs, including a modern foreign language, maths, English language, English literature, and two out of the three sciences, taught as separate disciplines. Students take four subjects in the lower Sixth Form, with new subjects such as economics, classical civilisation, further mathematics and politics also available. One subject can then be dropped for their final year at the school in the Upper Sixth. The School also offers the Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) in Sixth Form.\n\nAt the end of the first half of the autumn term, the school holds its prize giving in Clifton Cathedral.. The headmaster reads his annual report, and a guest speaker gives the prizes to the winning pupils.\n\nAt the end of the winter term, the school holds its carol service at Bristol Cathedral. The school returns to the cathedral at the end of the spring term for its \"Charter Day\" service, celebrating the founding of the school. This service is attended by the Lord Mayor of Bristol, and the school's original Elizabethan charter is put on display. The school choir often sings Council Prayers at the Lord Mayor's Chapel on College Green, where the school founder John Carr is buried.\n\nStandard school uniform for Years 7 to 11 consists of blue blazers, grey trousers, white shirts and the house tie.\n\nSixth Form students wear a grey or blue suit with pastel-coloured shirt. Students who excel at sports are often awarded with \"house colours\" for that sport in the form of a special tie. Prefects also wear a tie and badge of office.\n\nFor a long time the school was a traditional bluecoat school. This dress was eventually phased out as day uniform, but was still sometimes worn by boarders (until the cessation of boarding in 2008), and is still worn by choir members, and by the Captain and Vice Captains of the school, for special occasions such as Charter Day.\n\nQEH operates a house system whereby students are allocated to one of four houses and engage in house activities including academic competitions (such as foreign language readings), sports competitions, house drama, house choir, house music ensemble and many others.\n\nEach house is named after one of the school's notable patrons. The four houses are Bird's, named after William Bird, Mayor of Bristol 1589-90 and major benefactor of the school; Carr's, named after school founder John Carr; Hartnell's, named after Samuel Hartnell; Ramsey's, named after Lady Mary Ramsey. Hartnell was also a benefactor of the nearby school Clifton College, a fact reflected in them also having a house named Hartnell's.\n\nEach house has its own colour, and senior school students up to year 11 wear a tie with a stripe of that colour. Sixth Form students who are house captains also wear ties bearing their house colours. The colours for the houses are Bird's (yellow); Carr's (blue); Hartnell's (green); Ramsey's (red).\n\nStudents who excel at helping their house (usually sporting) are awarded \"house colours\" consisting of a rectangular badge in the colour of their house.\n\nThe organisation of each house is carried out by a designated House Master, and two sixth-form students, the Captain and Vice Captain of the house, who are picked by the House Master in conjunction with senior members of staff.\n\nThe school publishes several periodicals. \"QEH News\" is a small newsletter, published annually and available from the school's website, containing information on sports activities, school trips, development plans and future events. There is also an annual publication, \"The Elizabethan\", which gives a more in-depth commentary, as well as showcasing pupils' artistic and literary talents. A group of students, the Elizabethan Committee, supports the editor of The Elizabethan by taking photos and writing articles for the magazine. Along with this, an online newspaper called \"Berkeley Squares\" is written and edited by students in the sixth form.\n\nThe QEH theatre seats 210, and since opening in 1990 has been host to many productions both by QEH pupils and professional companies performing plays, dance and poetry. It also hosts concerts and other musical events, such as the biennial 'Battle of the Bands' and regular acoustic-only 'Unplugged' events, which showcase the musical talent in the school. Student volunteers often assist in school productions as technical and front of house staff.\n\nFormer pupils of the school are known as Old Elizabethans.\n\n\nRecords of QEH are held at Bristol Archives, including foundation, administrative, property, financial, admission, and illustrative material (Ref. 42536) (online catalogue).\n\n\n"}

Its patron saint is St. Peter Claver and fiesta is celebrated every ninth day of September.\n\nA large part of the municipal land area is a mining reservation due to extensive mineral deposits. This includes the Nickel ore loading port at Taganito, located 10 kilometers from the town proper of Claver, on the banks of Taganito river.\n\nClaver is politically divided into 14 barangays:\n\nThe Mamanwa village of Toyatoya is located in Barangay Urbiztondo.\n\nClaver is primarily a mining town with iron, nickel, copper and silver deposits on its Pulang Lupan mountains which are exploited mainly by the Taganito Mining Corporation. Mining, trading, and -traditionally - farming and fishing are the main sources of livelihood among residents. Fishing has become increasingly difficult due to water pollution as a consequence of mining activities.\n\nClaver was one of many coastal towns that for some time were ignored after the American and Filipino military forces surrendered to the Japanese in May 1942. Claver became the headquarters of the 114th Infantry Regiment of 10th Military District, which was the guerrilla organization under the jurisdiction of the United States Army. Some residents had fled for fear of a Japanese raid or occupation of the town, but an American whose family took refuge there said Claver still had a feeling of normalcy to it. On a hill above town the guerrillas maintained a radio station by which they kept in contact with other military units. The radio operator decided, without the knowledge of his superiors, to jam wavelengths used by the Japanese. The Japanese got a fix on the location of the station as a result.\n\nOn November 30, 1943, the Japanese took action to put the radio station out of business. Very early in the morning several Japanese ships appeared off the coast and began shelling the town with five-inch guns. After a prolonged shelling, Japanese troops landed and destroyed the radio station. The guerrillas left as the Japanese entered town and moved their headquarters elsewhere. Because the town had supported the guerrillas, the town was ransacked. The troops then returned to the ships, which left.\n\nMost of the residents fled south to avoid the Japanese, who did not occupy Claver. Claver remained almost abandoned until the end of the war.\n\n"}

Professionals in this area of endeavor are absorbed in advancing evocative terminologies and guidelines for education worldwide, enhancing educational structures and producing a context to which the success and effectivity of education programs and initiatives can be assessed.\n\nAccording to Harold Noah (1985), and Farooq Joubish (2009), comparative education has five purposes:\nComparative education is often incorrectly assumed to exclusively encompass studies that compare two or more different countries. In fact, since its early days researchers in this field have often eschewed such approaches, preferring rather to focus on comparisons within a single country over time. Still, some large scale projects, such as the PISA and TIMSS studies, have made important findings through explicitly comparative macro analysis of massive data sets. Recent examples in this regard include studies analyzing intra-European and intra-American teacher education.\n\nMany important educational questions can best be examined from an international and comparative perspective. For example, in the United States there is no nationwide certificate of completion of secondary education. This raises the question of what the advantages and disadvantages are of leaving such certification to each of the 50 states. Comparative education draws on the experience of countries such as Japan and France to show how a centralized system works, and what the advantages and disadvantages of a centralized certification are.\n\nCritics of comparative education refer to it as Policy Borrowing.\n\nComparative education is closely allied to, and may overlap with, international education, international development education, and comparative sociology.\n\nThe Comparative and International Education Society (CIES) was founded in 1956 to foster \"cross-cultural understanding, scholarship, academic achievement, and societal development through the international study of educational ideas, systems, and practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Anao and Aon vowed to be true to their love, despite the datu's objection. The datu wanted to break their love, however, he failed since the lovers were found dead near the riverbank in cold embrace.

{"id": "2128207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2128207", "title": "International education", "text": "International education\n\nInternational education refers to a dynamic concept that involves a journey or movement of people, minds, or ideas across political and cultural frontiers. It is facilitated by the globalization phenomenon, which increasingly erases the constraints of geography on economic, social and cultural arrangements. The concept involves a broad range of learning, covering, for instance, formal education and informal learning (e.g. training, exchange programs, cross-cultural communication). It could also involve a reorientation of academic outlook such as the pursuit of \"worldmindedness\" as a goal so that a school or its academic focus is considered international. For example, the National Association of State Universities prescribes the adoption of \"proper education\" that reflects the full range of international, social, political, cultural, and economic dialogue. International educators are responsible for \"designing, managing, and facilitating programs and activities that help participants to appropriately, effectively, and ethically engage in interactions with culturally diverse people and ideas.\"\n\nThe emergence of international education as a discipline may be attributed to the international and intercontinental initiatives of the past, which aimed to achieve education, learning, and intellectual exchange. This is demonstrated in the formalized academic relations between countries in the form of bilateral and scientific agreements. Here, international education is considered a mechanism of international cooperation and, in some cases, it stems from the recognition that different cultures offer different outlooks and styles of learning and teaching in addition to the transfer of knowledge.\n\nThere are scholars who associate the development of international education with comparative education, which is concerned with the evaluation and scrutiny of different educational systems in various countries for the purpose of developing an education and educational structures that are global in scope and application. This concept is considered ancient, having been used in classical Greece, while the actual term was first used by William Russell in 1826. International education diverged from it as it assumed the form of more organized programs that bring together learners and teachers from different countries to learn from each other.\n\nInternational education can be seen as developing ‘international-mindedness,’ or enhancing international attitude and awareness. From an ideological perspective, international education has a focus on moral development, by influencing the creation of \"positive attitudes towards peace, international understanding and responsible world citizenship\".\n\nFrom a pragmatic approach, international education can relate to economic and cultural globalization. For instance, there are increasing demands for education qualifications to be transferable between schools and education systems. Furthermore, there is a \"spread of global quality standards through quality assurances procedures such as accreditation\".\n\nOverall, international education can be viewed as the following:  \n\n\nDirect examples of international education include facilitating students’ entry into universities outside of their home countries. Also, temporarily studying abroad is another illustration of international education.\n\nThe International Baccalaureate (IB) Program is seen as an influence in the development of international education. The IB Diploma Program encourages students to learn and understand different cultures, languages, and points of view. This idea is incorporated into elements of the program e.g. Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS). CAS requires students to participate in activities promoting each of these three components. Through such activities, the intention is that global issues will affect students’ understanding of the world in a meaningful way. Specifically, these non-formal, non-academic experiences should enhance students’ comprehension of world issues in a manner that, for instance, reading books or participating in lessons may not.\n\nBased on student engagement and involvement, two general meanings emerge. The first refers to education that transcends national borders through the exchange of people. A good example would be students traveling to study at an international branch campus, as part of a study abroad program or as part of a student exchange program. The second is a comprehensive approach to education that intentionally prepares students to be active and engaged participants in an interconnected world.\n\nThe International Baccalaureate however, defines the term according to a certain criteria. This criteria include the development of citizens of the world in accordance with culture, language, and social cohesion, building a sense of identity and cultural awareness, encrypting recognition and development of universal human values, encouraging discovery and enjoyment of learning, equipping students with collectivist or individualistic skills and knowledge that can be applied broadly, fostering global thinking when responding to local situations, encourage diversity and flexibility in teaching pedagogic methodologies, and supply appropriate forms of assessment and international benchmarking.\n\nWhile definitions vary, international education is generally taken to include:\n\nOne of the eight millennium development goals ratified in the United Nations in the year 2000, focuses on achieving universal primary education. \nInternational education is also a major part of international development. Professionals and students wishing to be a part of international education development are able to learn through organizations and university and college programs. Organizations around the world use education as a means to development. Previous research demonstrates a positive correlation between the educational level and economic growth, especially in the poorest regions. The United Nations Millennium Development Goals include some objectives pertaining to education:\n\nOther mentions of education in regard to international development:\nEducation For All (EFA):\nAn international strategy to operationalise the Dakar Framework for Action;\nThe World Education Forum (Dakar 2000) agreed to reach 6 goals by 2015:\n\nAt the end of 2015, the United Nations led another initiative to continue on the work of development goals. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) contains 17 global goals, which are more extensive than the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Compared to the 2015 MDGs, the SDGs tries to ensure that no one is left behind. In this regard, not only state actors, but also major private \"non-state\" actors and multinational companies are involved and active in global education.\n\nEducation is stated under Goal 4 of the SDGs: \"Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.\" Furthermore, SDGs promote international education through some of the following targets:\n\n\nAccording to a report from the U.N. Secretary-General on \"Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals\" in 2018, official development assistance (ODA) for scholarships amounted to $1.2 billion in 2016. The largest contributors were Australia, France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and European Union. Education is a core aspect of the SDGs, and considered essential to their success. Hence, an international strategy has been established through the Incheon Declaration and Framework for Action. This strategy emphasizes  mobilizing national, regional, and global efforts and collaborations that aim at:\n\n\nThe UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005–2014)\nhighlighted the central role of education in the pursuit of sustainable development.\n\n\"See also\" Comparative education; and Liberalism, Realism, Power Transition Theory, International Development, as focus areas that provide insight into international phenomena relevant to \"International Education.\"\n\nThere are different lenses international education can be viewed as. For example, thinking of international education in terms of a study abroad program that can help prepare students when looking for international occupations. Another example can be that international development is a focal point that is taught in colleges and universities under the umbrella of international education.\n\nAlthough very successful programs such as Engineers Without Borders enable students in one country to obtain an international education while working on open source appropriate technology projects abroad, the cost of this approach can be prohibitive for large scale replication. Recent, work has shown that using a virtual educational exchange, can have many of the positive benefits associated with international education and cross cultural experiences, without the prohibitive costs of overseas programs.\n\nInternational Education Week is held in the United States by the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Education. The choice of week for celebration is determined at each institution, but is generally the week before the week that includes U.S. Thanksgiving: –; –; –; –. The aims of this event are to provide an opportunity to celebrate the benefits of international education and global exchange. This joint initiative promotes programs that prepare Americans for a global milieu and attract future leaders from abroad to study, learn and exchange experiences in the U.S. This shows how International education is not just about physically crossing borders, but is also about thinking globally in local situations. Schools throughout the US celebrate this week through on-campus and off-campus events.\nInternational Education Week is the same week as the American Education Week sponsored by the National Education Association.\n\nInternational education has a somewhat unusual position in higher education. While recognized as an important sphere of activity, it tends to be handled by administrative offices at the top of departments of languages and literature and international affairs. The scholars involved in international education usually have their primary involvement in other teaching and research. This leads to four distinctive characteristics particular to the field of international education:\n\n\nAdditionally, one of the challenges of international students is that increasingly higher education institutions are treating them as cash cows for meeting their budget challenges. Institutions must do more to support international students in their academic and career success by providing advising, training and coaching that is culturally attuned.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2128215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2128215", "title": "Surigao City", "text": "Surigao City\n\n', officially the ' (Surigaonon: \"Siyudad nan Surigao\"; Cebuano: \"Dakbayan sa Surigao\"; Spanish: \"Ciudad de Surigao\"), is a and capital of the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nLocated at the north-easternmost tip of Mindanao, it has a total land area of 245.34 km which is roughly 1.4% of Caraga region.\n\nThe absence of a fort in Surigao belies its significance and sphere of influence during the Spanish period. It was the capital of the expansive province of the same name from 1750 until its dissolution in 1911, covering a third of Mindanao Island's total land area. It is one of the oldest port towns in Mindanao, founded by Spanish colonizers in 1655. It has abundant mineral reserves including gold, iron, manganese, silica, cobalt, copper, chromite and among the world's largest nickel deposits in Nonoc Island. The Asian Institute of Management ranks the city as among the most competitive small-sized cities in the Philippines, with an estimated total income of 600 million pesos in 2012.\n\nThe city serves as a jump off point to visitors of nearby Siargao, Dinagat and Bucas Grande islands. It is Mindanao's closest landmass to the Visayas region. Eleven nautical miles across Surigao Strait separates the city from Panaon Island in the Visayas. Surigao is the center of politics, commerce, banking, industry and education of Surigao del Norte and Dinagat Islands as well as parts of neighboring provinces of Surigao del Sur, Agusan del Norte and Southern Leyte.\n\nThere are two hypotheses on the original meaning of \"Surigao\" among linguists, depending on the original root word. If the root word was taken to be \"sulig\" (\"sprout\" or \"spring up\"), then Surigao may have derived from \"suligao\" (\"spring water\"), likely referring to the Surigao River (known as \"Suligaw\" in Mandaya) that empties at the northern tip of the island of Mindanao. Early historical accounts record the name of the river as Suligao, Surigao, or Zurigan.\n\nAnother possibility is that it is derived from Visayan \"surogao\" or \"suyogao\", meaning \"water current\". From \"suyog\" (also \"sulog\" or \"surog\"), \"current\". Other Visayan words derived from the same root include Sinulog, Sulu, and Tausug (Suluk).\n\nThere is also a popular legend about Visayan fishermen who went adrift on a stormy day at the mouth of today's Surigao River. With boats wrecked, they were unable to sail back to sea. They were met by a docile village chieftain named \"Solibao\" who offered them his abode. The fishermen helped the chieftain procure food for the village's daily subsistence in exchange for his hospitality. One day, with much luck, they were able to paddle back home with the help of other fisherman who made it to the village they now named \"Solibao\". Some of the men eventually returned and settled in the area. During the 15th century, Spanish galleons dropped anchor near the settlement and came ashore. The Spanish historian, worn from the long transpacific journey misheard the people when he asked where they were, and instead wrote in his diaries \"Surigao\", referring to the land at the north-easternmost tip of Mindanao Island.\n\nThe town was renamed Caraga after its founding, derived from the word \"calagan\", from the Kalagan people, whose name means \"people of the [fierce/brave] spirit\". The Italian adventurer Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri, who published a book of travel in the country, cited Francisco Combes, S.J. as a source in saying that Calagan is derived from the two Visayan words, \"kalag\" for soul and \"an\" for people. Today, Caraga is the official name referring to the entire Region XIII, created through Republic Act No. 7901 on February 25, 1995, making it the newest region in the Philippines.\n\nSurigao City is situated at the north-easternmost tip of Mindanao Island. It is bounded by Municipalities of Dinagat and Basilisa to the north, Philippine Sea and the Municipality of Cagdianao to the east, Municipalities of Sison and Tagana-an to the south, Mindanao Sea and the Municipality of San Francisco to the west and the Surigao Strait to the north-west.\n\nSurigao City is marked by rolling hills that gently buffers its eastern and western boundaries. To the south-west towers the Kabangkaan Ridge which divides the city from the municipality of San Francisco (formerly Anao-aon). Kinabutan River (otherwise known as Surigao River) meanders Surigao valley before it empties to the Surigao tidal basin, a shrinking mangrove swamp fast overtaken by the city's expansion. It has an average elevation of 19 meters or 65.5 ft. above sea level. The highest elevation on the mainland at the Kabangkaan Ridge has a peak elevation of 465 meters above sea level. Along the border of Tagana-an is Mapawa Peak with an elevation of 245 meters above sea level. Barangays Cabongbongan, Nabago and Capalayan are at the foot of its slopes.\n\nMore than two dozen islands and islets make up two fifths of the city's total land area. They are separated from the mainland by Hinatuan Passage, which connects Mindanao Sea to the Pacific Ocean. The largest island of Nonoc is marked by a rusty-red weathering mantle of lateritic nickel ore, visible from any vantage point on the mainland coast. Its highest elevation at 263 meters above sea level typifies most of its hilly terrain. Across the channel at Hikdop Island, the highest point is Mt. Telegrapo at 100.05 meters. Hinatuan Island is similar to Nonoc's bare and rusty-red hilly appearance. Other notable islands of Hanigad, Sibale, Bayaganan and Awasan are generally flat, covered mostly with coconut trees and assorted hardwoods. Large swaths of mangrove and nipa palm forests cover its brackish waterways and shallow fringes of its coastlines.\n\nLike most of the country, Surigao is officially considered a tropical rainforest climate type, Köppen class \"Af\" with an average monthly precipitation of 308.66 mm (12.5 inches). It is distinctly wettest between the months of November until March. During the drier season between April to September, brief afternoon showers and thunderstorms locally called \"sobasco\", are commonplace.\n\nThe site around Surigao was settled early on, even before the Spanish conquest. Fishing villages dotted along the coast facing the Hinatuan Passage while Mamanwa tribes inhabited the interior highlands. The confluence of three major bodies of water- Pacific Ocean, Surigao Strait and Mindanao Sea, kept the area inhabited continuously for many centuries, although its historical importance waxed and waned as other parts of the archipelago were explored and developed. Nearby archeological digs attest early influences by Chinese, Hindu and Moro traders. At which time, it had been a territory ruled under the Rajahnate of Butuan.\n\nFerdinand Magellan sailed into the Philippine Archipelago, reaching the island of Homonhon in an epic voyage of discovery and eventual circumnavigation of the world in 1521. Magellan's fleet proceeded to Limasawa through Surigao Strait, a notch north-west of the city's pelagic boundaries, before dropping anchor on the waters off the island of Cebu, ushering the Spanish colonization of the Philippines.\n\nPresent day Surigao originated from a site in the city proper formerly known as \"Bilang-Bilang\" where it served as a port of call for inter-island vessels. It was renamed Banahao which became an integral part of the old district of Caraga, a town founded on June 29, 1655. After Caolo, present day Siargao, burned in 1750, Surigao became the capital of the expansive geopolitical, eclessiastical and military district of Surigao which reached the fringes of Davao and would include today's provinces of Surigao del Sur, Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, parts of Compostela Valley, Misamis Oriental, Davao del Norte and Davao Oriental. It officially became the permanent residence of the Augustinian Recollects on February 1, 1752, when all the canonical books were moved from Caolo to Surigao. The first canonical books bore the signature of Fr. Lucas de la Cruz. Previously, the place was just a \"vista\" of the parish in Caolo. Its strategic location and new status as the seat of government was costly. Surigao witnessed violent territorial struggles as it suffered ultimately from relentless Moro raids. In 1752, the town was devastated. Most of its 2,000 inhabitants were either killed or taken as slaves by the Moros.\n\n\nAt the turn of the century in 1901, the American colonizers established a civil government in the province of Surigao, keeping the town of Surigao as its capital. Surigao was then among the largest municipalities in land area with a jurisdiction of 949.90 square kilometers, larger than today's Butuan. During this period, there was only one main road, the Old Spanish road. The commercial district, market and plaza (Luneta) were all situated in one small area. In 1930, the Old Spanish road was abandoned and a new provincial road was constructed. The Casa Real was built where municipal administrators would hold their official functions. Surigao's core barrios- Taft and Washington, were named after United States presidents William Howard Taft and George Washington.\n\nSurigao featured prominently in World War II's Pacific theater. On May 23, 1942, the Japanese Imperial Army under Colonel Yoshie occupied Surigao after arriving from Butuan. They formally took over on May 28, 1942, under Lieutenant Ichichara, taking control from Mayor Amat. Filipino guerrilla units based in Surigao continued to operate in the hinterlands. Liberation from the Japanese rule dawned on September 9, 1944. American planes started their campaign by bombing the town in the early morning. It was followed by a strafing of all Japanese warships docked at the Surigao wharf, which came to transport fresh troops and supplies to their forces in Leyte. No less than fifty warships were sunk by the raiding American bomber planes. After the attack, not a single Japanese ship was seen afloat. The following month, on October 24–25, the famous Battle of Surigao Strait, the final line battle in naval history, was fiercely fought by allied forces against the Japanese fleet. By April 12, 1945, the whole province of Surigao was liberated from Japanese occupation.\n\nOne American family who had lived in and near Surigao before the war returned after the Japanese left the area in 1945. Virginia Holmes, a child in 1945, many years later wrote, \"We were shocked at the destruction the war years had wrought. Many houses stood empty, and others were mere skeletons. Walls were pockmarked with bullet holes. There were piles of rubble everywhere. The tree-lined streets that used to be so pretty were now full of potholes, and only a few trees were left undamaged.\" Holmes said the cemetery had been neglected and at least part of it was overgrown in weeds.\n\nMassive reconstruction followed the destruction brought by the war. The Surigao Provincial Capitol was completed in 1946 atop the hill overlooking the city. Other facilities were built including schools, athletic field and municipal jail. In 1948, the first election of municipal officials was held. In the same year, construction of the Surigao Provincial Hospital commenced. Six years later in 1954, construction of the first municipal building started and was completed in 1955. Economic activities continued to flourish with the launching of gold mining operations by Mindanao Mother Lode Mines in Mabuhay, 10 kilometers away from the city. Rapid economic growth and immigration resulted to losing some of its fishing and agricultural barrios as they were converted into towns of Malimono (July 31, 1956), San Francisco (May 24, 1957) and Sison (September 15, 1959). During the same year, settlements including Capalayan, Libuac, Catadman, Mat-i, Lipata, \"Dakung Patag\", \"Bunyasan\", \"Cantapoy\", \"Balite\", and \"Bambanon\" were elevated into barrios, the forerunner of modern-day barangays.\nAt that time, Surigao was classified as a 1st Class B municipality with an annual income of P160,000.00 and a population of nearly 50,000. It was primarily an agricultural town producing mainly copra and basic staples including rice, corn, bananas and rootcrops. Fishing was also a major source of livelihood. On September 18, 1960, pursuant to the Republic Act 2786 dated June 19, 1960, the province of Surigao was divided into Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur. The town of Surigao remained as a capital, this time for the province of Surigao del Norte.\n\nSurigao was on a rapid growth path. Already, it had a domestic airport, three movie houses, three hotels and two hospitals. However, on November 19, 1964, tragedy befell the town as it saw its most massive destruction yet. It was in the direct path of supertyphoon \"Ining\", internationally code- named \"Louise\" , with peak winds at 240 kilometers per hour. The wrath of the storm was severe and devastation wide, both in infrastructure and human lives. Just as they overcame the destruction of war, the locals tenacity was again proven in the town's rebuilding. In a short time, after three years in 1967, Pacific Cement Corporation started commercial operations in Mabuhay, producing among the highest quality cement in the country. In 1969, Marinduque Mining Industrial Corporation started nickel exploration in Nonoc Island with an initial capitalization of Php1.0 billion pesos, ushering a new era of prosperity.\n\nPursuant to Republic Act No. 6134, Surigao was converted to a chartered city on August 31, 1970, with Pedro Espina as its first city mayor.\n\nThe demographics of Surigao City are evidence of an ethnically diverse city. Throughout its history, Surigao has been a point of entry for immigrants from other regions of the Philippines, enticed by the city's political significance, attractive natural setting, abundant resources and during the last century, increased mining operations. Butuanons, Hiligaynons, Warays, Cebuanos and other ethnic groups found home in Surigao and eventually learned how to speak the language. Some of their descendants now hold prominent positions in the city and provincial governments. Migrants from China also found home in Surigao; their direct descendants now comprise the bulk of successful merchants of the Surigao business community.\n\nSurigao is home to one of the country's oldest and most colorful tribes, the \"Mamanwa\". They are similar to the Negritoes of Luzon in features and stature. They are generally short, dark-skinned with a crop of short kinky hair. Forced to settle in the hinterlands due to development, they continued to practice their customs and traditions. The faith about \"Kahimunan\", one of their many tribal festivities, highlights music and graceful dancing. Revelers chant and play while accompanied by native musical instruments including the gimbar (drum), gong and bamboo percussion called \"kalatong\" and \"katik\". Wild pigs, chicken and indigenous fruits including the rare \"kayape\" are among the offerings. A \"baylan\" (priest) presides the celebration as a tribute and invocation to their god \"Magbabaya\" and departed ancestors for good health and abundant harvest.\n\nMamanwas are also known for their creative patterns, brass jewelries and indigenous crafts, displayed proudly on their costumes as they fill the streets at the height of the \"Bonok Bonok Maradjao Karadjao\" Festival every September 9, celebrated on the occasion of the feast of Saint Nicolas de Tolentino, Surigao City's patron saint. \"Bonok-bonok\" and its prehistoric origins was another ritual to thank their gods, presided by various village chieftains and their wives. Happiness and friendship are expressed through dancing, chanting and singing. They wave scarves of \"banay\" as symbols of goodwill, wealth and blessings for all tribal villages.\n\nToday, most of the Mamanwas still live in the hinterlands, occasionally descending to town to sell or barter handicrafts and fresh harvest. Bands still subsist on foraging even as majority of them have adopted a more modern way of life over the years.\n\nSinurigaonon, the official language in the city and province is unique among the Visayan languages. It is also spoken by the majority of the population in the province of Surigao del Sur and around Lake Mainit in Agusan del Norte. Similarities with the Cebuano language is undeniable, however, staunch Cebuano speakers can hardly understand people who speak Surigaonon. There is no doubt Surigaonon existed as pure and distinct, slowly pelted over time by Visayan words as migrants settled in the area. Today, Surigaonon is the most widely spoken language inherent in the eastern Caraga region.\n\nSurigaonon has similar consonant and vowel sounds, stress, intonation patterns to the Cebuano language and Boholano dialect. Surigaonon underwent certain morphophonemic processes, such as assimilation, deletion, alternation and metathesis (Dumanig, 2005). In the study conducted by Dumanig (2005) on Descriptive Analysis of Surigaonon language it was found that there are 18 consonants (b,d,g,h,j,k,l,m,n,ng,p,r,s,t,w,y,o,?) with 18 sounds and 3 vowels (a,i,u) with 5 sounds. It has also 25 consonant clusters (br, bl, bw, by, dr, dy, dw, gr, gw, kr, kl, kw, mw, my, nw, pr, pl, pw, py, sw, sy, tr, tw, ty, hw) and 4 diphthongs (aw, ay, iw, uy), which are similar to the Cebuano language (Rubrico, 1999). There are Surigaonon words that are spelled similarly but they differ in meaning depending on how each syllable is stressed (Dumanig, 2005). Surigaonon language follows two intonation patterns like the rising and falling intonation. The rising intonation is common in asking yes or no questions and the falling intonation occurs in ending declarative and imperative statements (Dumanig, 2005)\n\nSurigao City is governed via the mayor-council system. The city council, nationally called \"Sangguniang Panlungsod\", consists of the vice mayor and 12 council members. The mayor is elected directly every three years.\n\nSurigao City is subdivided into 54 barangays, 33 in the mainland and 21 in the islands. Of the 36 coastal barangays, 15 are in the mainland and 20 are in the islands. The urban area covers 15 barangays or approximately 20% of the total land area. These include Taft, Washington, San Juan, Sabang, Canlanipa, Cagniog, Luna, Togbongon, Rizal, Lipata, Punta Bilar, Mabua and Ipil.\n\nSurigao City underwent rapid economic growth that spanned nearly two decades beginning in the late 1960s. Pacific Cement (PACEMCO) started commercial operations manufacturing Portland cement and the Canadian-owned company Marinduque Mining and Industrial Corporation (MMIC) also started extracting nickel and iron ore in Nonoc Island. This was a boon to the city as it generated commerce to meet increasing demand for goods and services. Towards the late 1970s, Surigao attained first class status. The rest of the province also saw increased mining operations, primarily extracting gold and copper. The city became the nexus of mining activity in the entire Northern Mindanao (Region X), at the time among Philippines' largest regions encompassing nearly half of Mindanao Island. Philippines' Bureau of Mines and Geosciences moved its regional headquarters in the city at Km. 1.\n\nIn 1983, MMIC ended commercial operations due to financial losses and heavy debt as a result of plummeting prices of nickel and high operating costs. Copra processing plant Surigao Coconut Development Corp. (SUCODECO) in Lipata also shut down. Surigao's weakened economy was further affected when typhoon \"Nitang\" (internationally codename Typhoon Ike) struck the city in September 1984. Seventy percent of the buildings and infrastructure were destroyed. Commercial activities declined, relying on basic services, small-scale industries, agriculture and fishing.\n\nFrom the mid 80s until the turn of the 21st century, Surigao's economic woes mirrored the rest of the nation as it saw some of its original families leave for opportunities in other places, both local and overseas. \nDuring the last decade, the city saw improvement of its key macroeconomic indicators. Increased retail activity was evident downtown as new stores opened and existing ones expanded. The success of major restaurant chains like Jollibee, Greenwich, Chowking (closed in 2014 but reopened in May 2016) and Mang Inasal opened the floodgates for more investments in the city. McDonald's also opened in March 2013 (after 5 years, it opened its second branch in October 2018) followed by Goldilocks in March 2015 and finally, the 2nd branch of Red Ribbon in June 2016. Shakey's Pizza opened its first doors at the ground floor of Gaisano Capital Mall in June 2019. Dunkin' Donuts and KFC were planned to open soon in the future. Hotel rooms doubled with the opening of new hotels and expansion of existing ones, with adequate convention facilities. Port expansion was completed in 2009, increasing its handling capacity. Today, it is one of the country's key seaports for gross registered tonnage handled, mainly from its mineral exports .\n\nThe city's primary agricultural produce includes rice, corn, vegetables, rootcrops, coconut, copra and bananas. It is a major supplier of fish and crustaceans; its exports reach buyers as far as Hong Kong, Japan and China. An integrated fishport is planned which includes functional facilities such as fish market, gear and commercial shops, administration building and fish container storage facilities.\n\nSurigao's retail activity is centered mainly around Luneta Park along the streets of San Nicolas, Borromeo and Rizal. A new uptown shopping district is developing in the city's Barangay Luna. Regional malls opened in early 2012 (one of which is Gaisano Capital Surigao, opened in December 2011). ParkWay Mall also opened in the last quarter of 2012 (including ParkWay Supermarket, opened in June 2013). 7-Eleven opened its first two stores in the last quarter of 2018 along with Prince Hypermart, which is also a branch to open in the city, coming soon in early 2019 and CityMall is also expected to open.\n\nNonoc Island has been identified as a special economic zone (Ecozone) by the national government, a boon older residents are quite familiar due to its once prosperous nickel ore production. This project is aimed to put the island's existing infrastructure, including a 1300-meter concrete airstrip and two 60,000 dwt seaport, back in operation. In 2005, China's Jinchuan Group Ltd. submitted a proposal to invest approximately US$1.0 billion for the rehabilitation and revival of the Nonoc nickel refinery. In 2010, Jinchuan renewed its interest in Nonoc, offering a bigger investment at $1.5 billion. However, its insistence for another feasibility study and disagreements over the operating structure shuttered the deal with Philnico who owns the mining rights for the island. In January 2012, San Miguel Corporation of the Philippines entered into a memorandum of agreement with the city government to rehabilitate and operate the Nonoc mines for $3 billion, the single biggest investment in the city yet.\n\nThe recent entry of major international mining company Sumitomo with $1.3 billion investment in the province sparked renewed interest of its vast mineral reserves and has helped spur secondary economic activities in the city. Other mining companies like Philex Mining Corporation , Mindoro Resources Ltd. and Anglo Ashanti are in various stages of exploration.\n\nTourism figures showed 200,000 foreign arrivals in the city in 2011, registering a 37% growth.\n\n\nAveraging a 21-ton daily collected garbage, the local government of Surigao built a sanitary landfill in Sitio Looc in 2009 under a PP150 million grant from the Swedish government and assistance from the Land Bank of the Philippines. It is considered a model for solid waste management which includes a P45 million-worth waste treatment facility, a material recovery facility which treats recyclables and a leachate collector, which extracts and treats liquids from garbage.\n\nSurigao Provincial Sports Complex, host to numerous national and regional events, underwent renovation in 2009 at a cost of PP320 million. The complex is situated on the 2-hectare Vasquez field and includes a 3,500-person capacity grandstand, a fully air conditioned 3,500 seating capacity gymnasium, a brand new amphitheater, an Olympic-size swimming pool and a fully rubberized track and field oval. Surigao Provincial Convention Center, also part of the complex, has a seating capacity of approximately 2,500 persons.<br>\n\nMotorized tricycles, an indigenous form of auto- rickshaw that can accommodate about six passengers, is mainly the mode of transport in the city. Buses and jeepneys follow fixed routes to outlying barangays, towns and neighboring provinces. The city is also served by outrigger water taxis called pump boats that follow scheduled sea routes to island \"barangays\". Larger vessels called \"Lantsa\" have scheduled trips to Siargao, Dinagat and Bucas Grande. Regular ferry service connects the city to ports in Southern Leyte, Cebu, Manila and Agusan del Norte. There are direct flights to Manila and Cebu originating from the city's airport with occasional chartered flights to Siargao, Butuan and Tandag.\n\nHistoric Verano port completed a PP414 expansion and upgrade in 2009 to meet world standards and increased cargo demand from a revitalized mining industry in the province. Additional 2000 square meters of reclaimed area and 120 meters of berthing space were added. The port ranks as a major transshipment point in region.\n\nLipata Port and Ferry Terminal serves as the entry point to Mindanao Island forming part of the extensive Pan-Philippine Highway also called Maharlika Highway AH26 that originates from Laoag to its southern terminus in Zamboanga City. The port has ro-ro capabilities that provides regular service to the ports of Liloan and San Ricardo, both in Southern Leyte.\n\nPan- Philippine Highway AH26's northernmost terminus in Mindanao winds up in this city, dissecting the Surigao Valley before the Surigao-Davao Coastal Road spurs at Bad-as, Placer. An integrated bus and jeepney terminal serves companies with routes that reach major destinations including Ormoc, Tacloban, Legazpi, Manila, Butuan (change buses travel to Cagayan de Oro), Tandag, Davao, and Bislig (Mangagoy). Bus companies serving this terminal includes Bachelor Express, Philtranco, Davao Metro Shuttle, PP Bus Line and Surigao Express.\n\nClassified by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines as a principal domestic airport, Surigao Airport (SUG) is one of the two airports that serve the province of Surigao del Norte and northern parts of Surigao del Sur and Agusan del Norte. Cebgo and Airphil Express have regular scheduled flights from Surigao to Manila and Cebu. Small private planes operate chartered flights to Siargao's Sayak Airport. Due to increased passenger traffic and cargo, it is undergoing feasibility studies for future expansion to accommodate larger aircraft.\n\nCompleted in 2007, San Juan-Lipata Coastal Road connects the Port of Lipata to downtown Surigao, cutting the travel time in half. It includes a series of bridges across coastal barangays of San Juan and Sabang. The longest, Banahaw, spans the Surigao tidal basin.\n\nNew facilities built by leading telecommunication companies paved way for clear reception to other parts of the country and the rest of the world. The PLDT, Philippine Communications (PhilCom), Bayan Telecommunications (Bayantel), Sun Cellular, Globe Telecom and Smart Communications operate vital transmission towers in the city.\n\nOn February 11, 1997, the Congress of the Philippines enacted Republic Act 8244 converting Surigao Provincial Hospital into a regional training hospital and renamed it Caraga Regional Hospital, effectively expanding its scope and services that would include the entire Caraga region with a catchment population of nearly 2 million people. Today, this 150- bed tertiary hospital, a core referral facility, is rapidly expanding with intensive care units that includes Coronary, Pediatric, Surgical and Burn.\n\nIn October 2010, the city opened a PP35 million Drug Rehabilitation and Treatment Center in Anomar. Established under the aegis of the Department of Health, it is the first and only facility in the entire Caraga region solely focused on the treatment and rehabilitation of victims of substance abuse.\n\nOther major hospitals in the city include St. Paul University Hospital, Miranda Family Hospital, Surigao Medical Center (undergoing a major expansion) & the soon to open Surigao Doctors Hospital.\n\nSurigao traces its roots to formal schooling in the year 1906 when the last group of Spanish Benedictine Missionaries, who had worked zealously to have founded the Cartilla or Doctrina School (Escuela Catolica de San Nicolas), vacated Surigao. Soon after their departure, the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart also known as the Dutch Fathers, succeeded them, created the parish of Surigao, and made the Escuela Catolica de San Nicolas a parochial school which later became San Nicolas College. In 2002, Surigao became the first urban center in the entire Caraga region to host a university after San Nicolas College changed its nomenclature to Saint Paul University Surigao, a part of Saint Paul University System.\n\nIn 1969, Surigao School of Arts and Trades was established on 1.2 hectares of land donated by the provincial government. It focused on curricula geared towards technology at a time the city saw rapid transformation with the onset of nickel exploration at the Nonoc island refinery. While the school was built, it initially held classes at the Provincial Sports Complex with a core census of 14 teachers and 103 students. In 1998, the school was renamed Surigao State College of Technology after it merged with Malimono School of Fisheries. On June 4, 2013, Surigao del Norte State University was established under Rep. Act 10600, integrating Surigao del Norte State College of Technology with Siargao National College of Science and Technology in Del Carmen and the Surigao del Norte College of Agriculture and Technology in Mainit.\n\nSan Sebastian College-Recoletos de Manila Institute of Law- Surigao Extension located in Taft opened in 1997. Other colleges in the city include Surigao Education Center , St. Jude Thaddeus Institute of Technology, STI College Surigao , Northeastern Mindanao Colleges, St Ignatius Loyola Computer College, Center for Healthcare Professions and the newly established Surigao Doctor's College.\n\nIn 1996, Caraga Regional Science High School was established in San Juan, providing students in the entire region an opportunity to join an academe of reputable standards, now nationally recognized. Students undergo a rigorous highly accelerated 4- level curriculum which includes two years of general studies and two years of a chosen major. With much success as it garnered consistent topnotchers in the National Secondary Achievement Test (NSAT), students also have opportunities to carry out independent research and compete in Intel Science Fairs.\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town became a part of the province of Dinagat Islands in December 2006, when the province was created from Surigao del Norte by Republic Act No. 9355.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nTubod lies in a valley at the centre of the peninsula that is the mainland portion of Surigao del Norte, with hills and mountains to the east and west of the town. A natural feature in the western hills is Songkoy Spring, where clear water emerges from the rainforest and collects in a natural pool that is a popular local swimming place.\n\nRural areas along the valley floor are dominated by agriculture, while the hills are home to coconut plantations, rainforest and gold mining. To the south of Tubod is Lake Mainit on the border between Surigao del Norte and Agusan del Norte.\n\nThe Maharlika Highway runs through the centre of Tubod and links the town with the major center of Surigao City in the north. The closest airport is in Surigao City which has flights to Cebu and Manila. Ferries at Surigao City connect the mainland with the adjacent islands of Surigao del Norte and the neighbouring province of Southern Leyte.\n\nTubod is politically subdivided into 9 barangays.\n\n\nTubod in the early times is woodland, otherwise known as a virgin forest, where native inhabitants called the “Mamanwas” have been living. Mamanwas are nomadic in nature. They travel from the hinterland of Tubod and usually stayed near riverbanks. Mamanwa is derived from words \"Man\" - meaning people, and “Banwa,” meaning jungle - A Mamanwa means a man living in the jungle.\n\nThe Mamanwa tribe is still occupying hinterlands of Tubod particularly in Barangays Cawilan and Motorpool. They were very significant in the beginning of building homes for the Tuboranons, and the development of Tubod.\n\nAgustin Mendez is recognized as Tubod Founding Hero and First Christian settler who discovered the woods and founding the place. He was an immigrant from Ubay, Bohol Province during the 19th Century, when he began to develop Tubod and mark the town in Surigao del Norte's map. It was Agustin Mendez who organized its first Cabeza de Barangay that created the first Sitio.\n\nCabeza, in the Philippine occupation of Spain, was adapted to name founding “Leader” as well as its Cabezilla or “Kagawad” as it is called today. The Original Tuboranon Cabeza de Barangay founding members were - Agustin Mendez, Donato Pacatang, Florencio Gallenero, Gabriel Sumania, Isaias Calamba, Marciano Dapar, Galanida, Basil, Lumayag and Barro. Mendez led the Cabeza de Barangay bloc and young Galanida was their Secretary. The rest were known as Cabeza Council members.\n\nTo create the name for the newly found Sitio, Mendez commissioned a priest from Carrascal, Surigao del Sur but was not able to come as the means of transportation that time was only through use of a Kayak to reach Carrascal to Placer (nearest to Tubod), then via horses to Barangay Timamana. \nHowever, Tubod Founding Hero Agustin Ganot Mendez never stopped dreaming. He requested for a clergyman in Jabonga, Agusan del Norte. They cruised Tubod River to Sabang point of Lake Mainit to reach the Sitio and celebrate its founding.\n\nChristian settlers believed the importance of a First Christian mass celebration during foundation. This was probably the root of how Tuboranons were raised religious in the Roman Catholic faith. This was also the day when the new Sitio’s name was conceived. Rev. Father Sanidad officiated the first Mass and declared the new sitio after his name “Sitio Union Sanidad” on the 3rd of April.\n\nSitio Union Sanidad was mainly of rough roads, community nipa houses where only a few people settled. Its progress began with Barangay Timamana in Placer where Agustin Mendez first established residence and cultivated farmlands day in and out. He then later transfers his family in Barangay Poblacion, Tubod.\n\nLater, through an order from constituted authorities, Sitio Union Sanidad was declared as independent from Barangay Timamana and was called Barangay Tubod come 1908. With Agustin Mendez leading the barangay, he became its First Leader & Originator (Barrio Lieutenant) and named the woods \"Tubod\" from the local dialect \"Tuboran\" that meant 'source of water.' The early Barangay Tubod had a population roughly 100 people, mostly immigrants from Bohol, Cebu, Leyte, Camiguin and Surigao. Its main socio-agricultural sources of income were from abaca, coffee, rice as well as root crops such as ube, camote and calibre. \nAs progress continued, it became a large source of coconuts/copra and began its own irrigated rice farming.\n\nBarangay Tubod is surrounded by mountainous terrains, hills and the famous Mt. Maniayao standing overlooking the town. Pasturelands and mountain ranges, the presence of natural deposit and mineral resources like gold, silver, copper, chromate and iron are all God’s blessings for the Tuboranon to this very day.\n\nTuboranon religious undertaking, Mr. Mendez donating Two (2) Solid Wood Sculptured Patron Saints Peter and Paul sculpted on 19th Century. All the way, town feast falls every June 28–29 each year. \n\nThus, Tubod Founding Hero Agustin Mendez legacy founded Tubod and took several donations for Municipal and Roman Catholic Church Settlement. \nEventually, as per Municipal Resolution on 1989 asserts Mr. Agustin “Usting” Mendez Tuboranon Local or Municipal Hero of our time. Apparently, series of donation from portion of track land in order to entice people and capture to live.\nThe political bustle exists in Tubod. It led by Mr. Agustin Mendez establishing TUBOD and inherited by Famous Tuboranon Leaders. They were appointed and elected based on our Tubod Municipal Archives record. Tubod was previously part of the Municipality of Mainit, Surigao del Norte. It created by virtue of Executive Order No. 269 dated September 18, 1957.\n\nThe Surigaonon language is the common local language, while Cebuano, Filipino, and English are also spoken.\n\n\n"}

The tower marks the site of College Hall, the first building constructed on the campus, as well as the first building in America erected for instruction in scientific agriculture. Due to poor construction, College Hall collapsed in 1918. John W. Beaumont, an 1882 alumni of MSU, proposed the construction of the monument to conserve the Campus Circle and serve as a monument to teaching.\n\nDuring its dedication ceremony, the president of the college described the Beaumont Tower as \"a meeting or trysting place of the students, student groups or organizations, the center of all the activities of this institution\". The tower was also to serve as a time piece for the university, directing students' daily activities by sounding hourly.\n\nThe tower, designed in the Collegiate Gothic architectural style, features \"The Sower\", an Art Deco bas-relief by sculptor Lee Lawrie (1922), with the inscription \"Whatsoever a Man Soweth\" (from Galatians 6:7). This serves as a tribute both to MSU's origins as an agricultural college and to the seminal nature of knowledge.\n\nBeaumont also houses a full carillon, with 49 bells. Originally the tower had only ten bells but over time additional bells were added until a full range of music could be played from these. The bells now play frequently throughout the day activated by a computer. The Campus Circle where the tower is located often serves as a gathering place for students where free concerts on the lawn are available in the summer. The Beaumont Tower is one of the most recognizable and most photographed landmarks on the MSU campus. Its likeness as a line drawing is used on MSU letterhead. Special performances using the carillon are provided for specific occasions.\n\nThe northeast finial is higher than the other three. The missing finials represent the need for higher education.\n\nThe tower is also the meeting place for the executive board of the Michigan State University Tower Guard. The Tower Guard, founded in 1934 by May Shaw, the wife of former MSU president Robert Shaw, is MSU’s oldest and one of the most respected student organizations on campus. It was originally a female honor society that was a service-oriented organization which would help to serve the needs of visually impaired students at Michigan State University. In 1977, membership was opened to the outstanding young men on campus in addition to women. Each year, the top sophomores are chosen to carry on the tradition based on their academic excellence, leadership, outstanding character, and commitment to service.\n\n\n"}

Reynolds' broadcasting career started on TV in Buffalo at WGR TV 2 and he worked at various stations, including at WNBC.\n\nHis first radio job was WWOL in Buffalo with Dick Purtan, then WKWK, in Wheeling, WV. After that, he continued at several venerable stations, including WKBW in Buffalo, New York, WNBC and WOR in New York City, KQV in Pittsburgh, KMPC and KRTH in Los Angeles, WDRC in Hartford, WIXY in Cleveland, and WIBG and WFIL in Philadelphia.\n\nHe rose to fame as a Top 40 radio personality during the 1960s and 1970s, amassing large audiences in places such as Hartford, Connecticut, Cleveland, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and his hometown of Buffalo, New York. Reynolds is often regarded as an early progenitor of \"shock talk radio\", whose sometimes outlandish on and off-air stunts garnered widespread publicity. (The Four Seasons even produced a special radio jingle for the introduction of his daily radio show, set to the tune of their hit \"Big Girls Don’t Cry\"). A Reynolds WPOP theme song put lyrics to the sax-laden hit \"Wild Weekend\", by Buffalo, NY group The Rockin' Rebels (the song had been written as a theme for another Buffalo radio personality, Tom Shannon).\n\nReynolds excelled at comedic voice characterizations as a way of making social commentary without being directly attributable to \"Joey Reynolds\". Some of his regular voices included \"Jack Armstrong\"- All American boy; \"Maude Frickett\"-104 year old teenager, and \"General Shelby Singleton Silvers Junior Esquire Y'all\".\n\nReynolds was the focus of a two-part series on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" concerning talk radio personalities, on which more than a dozen of Reynolds' media peers paid tribute to him. Moreover, he has been invited to speak about entertainment media at several radio industry conferences. During his time in Buffalo, he and fellow DJ Danny Neaverth recorded a novelty single entitled \"Rats in My Room\" (an expanded and rearranged cover of a Leona Anderson song of the same name).\n\nReynolds and Neaverth, on behalf of WKBW, were offered the chance to bring The Beatles to Buffalo Memorial Auditorium on February 10, 1964, the day after the band had appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". It would have been the Beatles' first concert in North America. Unwilling to risk the $3500 appearance fee for a Monday night concert, in the poor February weather, for an unproven band he did not expect to sell out the auditorium, the two declined the offer. It was not until after Beatlemania swept the nation that they acknowledged that it was a mistake to not bring them in. In the three years the band toured North America, they never performed a show in Buffalo.\n\nJoey Reynolds was in the category of disc jockey, playing music on music intensive radio stations from the very late 1950s until the mid-1980s during his time on Z100 and WFIL. In 1986, he arrived at the former WNBC in New York City doing the afternoon drive, Howard Stern's previous shift. That station was attempting to move into a more talk intensive full service format with music taking a backseat but still heard. Reynolds was basically playing a mix of oldies and adult contemporary cuts along with comedy and personality, and was most notably on the air when the station's traffic helicopter crashed, killing reporter Jane Dornacker. He exited WNBC at the end of February 1987 and was replaced by Alan Colmes.\n\nHis next stations were morning shows and at that point Joey had evolved into more of a talk intensive program. He was less a DJ and more like a talk show host. By 1995, Joey was no longer playing music on his shows and in 1996 he arrived at WOR in New York. He has been a talk show host since.\n\nWhile Reynolds' present persona can be considered mellower by comparison, he still retains a loyal audience. In Denver, Colorado, he hosted a radio-television simulcast on KOA-AM, and launched (and hosted) the first nationwide satellite radio programming featured on more than 35 radio stations coast-to-coast.\n\nReynolds' career memoir is titled, \"Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella, But Don’t Get a Mouthful of Rain\". He maintains a second home in Florida and spends most weekends with two daughters from a previous marriage.\n\nOn March 10, 2010, it was revealed that WOR would pick up \"Coast to Coast AM\" from Premiere Radio and would cancel \"The Joey Reynolds Show.\" (\"Coast to Coast\" had been heard on crosstown rival WABC for several years, before that station dropped the show in favor of an in-house offering from Doug McIntyre, which led Premiere to seek WOR as the new New York affiliate.) Reynolds' last show, which was segregated into the \"Final Gay Hour,\" the \"Final Jewish Hour\" and \"The Final Hour,\" aired the morning of April 3, 2010.\n\nReynolds later hosted \"All Night with Joey Reynolds\" on WNBC-DT2, the digital subchannel of television station WNBC-TV known as \"New York Nonstop.\" It was broadcast live from the NASDAQ site in Times Square at 43rd Street and Broadway. Reynolds was reunited with his former WNBC radio sidekick, Jay Sorensen, as the program's announcer. The series ended on April 25, 2011.\nSteve Garrin was the producer and guest booker.\n\nReynolds made a cameo appearance on the ill-fated \"Buffalo Night in America\" broadcast on WBBZ-TV in July 2012.\n\nOn September 18, 2016, Joey returned to radio on WABC-AM in New York with a Sunday evening program, \"The Late Joey Reynolds Show\".\n\n\n"}

His music has a wide range of expression, generally within a tonal idiom notable both for its rhythmic propulsiveness and a strong lyrical element. Acclaimed particularly for his chamber music, he has also written extensively for voice and large ensembles.\n\nDillon was born in Summit, New Jersey, the youngest of eight children raised by a widowed mother. He lost 50% of his hearing in an early childhood bout with chicken pox. Intrigued by his siblings' piano lessons, he began his own at age seven, and soon developed a habit of composing a new work for his lesson each week. In 1985, he became the youngest composer to earn a doctorate at The Juilliard School, winning the Gretchaninoff Prize upon graduation. He studied privately with Vincent Persichetti, and in classes with Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter, David Diamond, Leon Fleischer and Roger Sessions. Other teachers included Edwin Finckel and James Sellars. As a student, he won an ASCAP Young Composers Award and first prize in the annual CRS New Music Competition. Upon graduation, he was appointed to the Juilliard faculty.\n\nIn 1990, Dillon was offered the position of Assistant Dean at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts where he is now Composer in Residence. His works are recorded on the Bridge, Naxos and Albany labels and published by American Composers Editions, a subdivision of BMI. In recent years, he has received increasing recognition for music that Gramophone called \"arresting and appealing.\" In the last ten years, his compositions have been commissioned and performed by the Emerson String Quartet, Lauren Flanigan, the Ravinia Festival, the Daedalus String Quartet, the Lincoln Trio, the Seattle Chamber Music Society, the Cassatt String Quartet, the Kavafian/Jolley/Vonsattel Trio, Danielle Belén, Le Train Bleu, the Mansfield Symphony, the Boise Philharmonic, Wintergreen Summer Arts Festival, the Salt Lake City Symphony, the Quartetto di Sassofoni d'Accademia, the Winston-Salem Symphony, Low and Lower, the University of Utah and the Idyllwild Symphony Orchestra. From 1999-2014 he worked on the Invisible Cities String Quartet Cycle, a set of six quartets zooming in on individual aspects of the quartet tradition.\n\nDillon has been a guest composer at numerous schools and festivals, including The Curtis Institute of Music, the St. Petersburg/Rimsky Korsakov Conservatory, SUNY Stony Brook, the Colburn School of Music, the Ravinia Festival, the Hartt School of Music, the Charles Ives Center, Seisen International School, Wintergreen Summer Arts Festival, Charlotte New Music Festival, Spoleto Festival and Indiana University.\n\nDillon was the Featured American Composer in the February 2006 issue of CHAMBER MUSIC magazine. He is a two-time winner of the North Carolina Artist Fellowship, the highest honor accorded to artists in the state.\n\nReviewers of Dillon’s music have repeatedly noted his arresting ideas, technical skill, lyricism and wit. In a review of his fourth string quartet, the Washington Post cited the work’s “jewel-like craftsmanship,” saying, “Dillon’s control of time was a conspicuously imaginative element throughout.” Gramophone called his recording \"Insects and Paper Airplanes\" “Sly and mysterious…just when you thought the string quartet may have reached the edge of sonic possibilities, along comes a composer who makes something novel, haunting and whimsical of the genre… Each score is an arresting and appealing creation, full of fanciful and lyrical flourishes…Highly recommended.” And Musicweb International commented on “music that is often profound without being pretentious, sometimes light-hearted but never 'lite', humorous without being arch, and immensely appealing but never frivolous.\" Fanfare magazine called him “an original in the best sense of the word.”\n\n\n\nDillon's blog \"Infinite Curves\" was featured on Sequenza21.com for ten years before moving to ArtsJournal.\n"}

If the agreement is made among three or more nations, it is called a multilateral environmental agreement (MEA). Such agreements, primarily produced by the United Nations, cover subjects such as atmospheric policies, freshwater policies, hazardous waste and substance policies, the marine environment, nature conservation policies, noise pollution and nuclear safety.\n\nThe use of multilateral environment agreements began in 1857, when a German agreement regulated the flow of water from Lake Constance to Austria and Switzerland. International environmental protocols came to feature in environmental governance after trans-boundary environmental problems became widely perceived in the 1960s.\n\nBetween 1857 and 2012, a total of 747 multilateral environmental agreements have been concluded. Following the Stockholm Intergovernmental Conference in 1972, creation of international environmental agreements proliferated. MEAs were popularized by the United Nations, the majority of MEAs have been implemented since the 1972 at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (also known as the Stockholm Conference). The Stockholm Declaration was adopted by all 113 countries in attendance at the conference, and was the first universal document of importance on an environmental issue.\n\nA complex networking system is needed for a functional MEA system. Levels of government within a nation may impede each other about climate change (for example) due to opposing views or parties, making implementation more difficult and impacting external relationships.\n\nPolicies surrounding an MEA are determined by the participating countries. The United Nations and the World Trade Organization are key intergovernmental organizations for forging and implementating the agreements.\n\nProtocols can take flexible approaches to improve effectiveness. One example is the use of sanctions: under the Montreal Protocol, signatories were forbidden to purchase chlorofluorocarbons from non-signatories, in order to prevent any windfall benefits. Funding has also been used to overcome North-South conflict: members of the Montreal Protocol created a fund of $240 million to redistribute the costs of transition. It also has different ten-year grace period for developing countries. Differential obligations are also seen in the Kyoto Protocol and can encourage wider participation, where every country have very different targets mainly based on their development.\n\nWhile protocols appear to be the ultimate top-down mode of governance, having \"scant provisions for public participation,\" it is widely thought that the influence of transnational networks has been growing Public opinion is relevant, as concern must exist to prompt action and dedication of government resources. It kept growing more and more since the young activist Greta Thunberg started Fridays for Future. Non-governmental organizations also fulfill certain roles, from gathering information and devising policies to mobilizing support. Science plays an important part, although Susskind asserts that sometimes this role is diminished by uncertainty, disagreement, and the rise of \"adversary science.\" The business community can also be involved with positive outcomes.\n\nHow we view the effectiveness of protocols depends on what we expect from them. With little administrative force or actual power, protocols succeed in increasing government concern, enhancing the contractual environment, and heightening capacity through transfer of assets. Yet as long as sovereignty is intact, environmental protocols will not affect changes in the face of state or public apathy, guarantee national action, or materialize overnight. The progress of international environmental law might be, as Wiener suggests, like the tortoise, slow but steady.\n\nThe world's existing political systems, differences and conflicts pose barriers to the creation of environmental protocols. First, maintenance of sovereignty means that no country can be forced to participate, only urged to do so. Consequently, as French states, \"International law has the force of moral suasion, but few real teeth.\" Second, North-South conflict can block cooperation and cause conflicts. The countries in the global South, considered the poor one, generally see the countries of the North, the rich one, as needing to take responsibility for environmental degradation and make significant changes in their way of living, neither of which the North deems reasonable. The south argue that the north have already had the opportunity to develop and already polluted a lot during their industrial development.\n\nFinally, countries may lack motivation to change their environmental policies due to conflict with other interests, especially economic prosperity. If environmental protocols will cause economic difficulties or harm to a country, it may shirk the protocols while other countries adhere to them, creating a classic free-rider problem. Additionally, environmental protocols may be criticized for scientific uncertainty, or at least a lack of synthesis of scientific information, which may be used for \"blocking interests and doing mischief.\" That now can be nearly considered an excuse, defined as climate change scepticism.\n\nDue to these barriers, environmental protocols become an obvious target for several criticisms, such as being slow to produce the desired effects (due to the convention-protocol-ratification-implementation process), tending to the lowest common denominator, and lacking monitoring and enforcement. They can also be criticized for taking an incremental approach where sustainable development principles suggest that environmental concern should be mainstreamed.\n\nThe United Nations is involved in MEAs worldwide on a number of issues, including biological diversity, chemicals and waste, and climate and the atmosphere. One example would be the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, which was brought together to address the hazardous effects of Chlorofluorocarbons on the atmosphere. The United Nations Information Portal (InforMEA) brings together MEAs by harvesting COP decisions and resolutions, news, events, MEA membership, national focal points, national reports and implementation plans from MEA secretariats and organizes this information around a set of agreed terms, for the benefit of Parties and the environment community at large\n\nThe World Trade Organization has been involved in MEA negotiations due to the agreements' trade implications. The organization has trade and environmental policies which promote the protection and preservation of the environment. Its objective is to reduce trade barriers and coordinate trade-related measures with environmental policies. Since MEAs protect and preserve the environment, they may help ease restrictions on trade. The WTO’s principles are based on non-discrimination, free trade through reduction of trade barriers and fair competition, and MEAs have been rejected for not being in accordance with the organization's principles. The WTO is working with and implementing over 350 MEAs worldwide. Most of the agreements involve five core countries which are committed to environmental improvement and free trade. WTO members are legally bound to respect negotiated reductions of barriers to trade. However, conflict has arisen due to trade restriction.\n\nAustralia is noted for its wide variety of animal species and diverse environment, which includes beaches, deserts and mountains, and climate change is a major concern. The country is under the largest ozone hole in the world, with environmental impact. Australia's proximity to Antarctica raises concerns about sea-level rise and changes in ocean currents which influence climate.\n\nCanada's multilateral environmental agreements encompass air, biodiversity and ecosystems, chemicals and waste, climate change, environmental cooperation, marine and the oceans, and meteorology. Canada has taken an initiative due to the country's variety of natural resources, climates and populated areas, all of which can contribute to environmental stress.\n\nThe United States has committed to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and global negotiations on mercury. The number of MEAs in which the U.S. is involved is substantially lower than Canada's, despite its greater population and larger carbon footprint and economy.\n\n\n\n"}

Whether Aaron, like the rest of the Bulanids, was a Khagan or a Bek is an unresolved issue.\n\nAccording to the anonymous author of the Schechter Letter, during Aaron's reign a war was launched against Khazaria by an Eastern Roman-inspired coalition led by the Alans, who had been allies of Aaron's father Benjamin. Aaron defeated his enemies with the help of Oghuz mercenaries and captured the king of the Alans alive. Rather than execute his captive, he demanded an oath of fealty and spared his life. The Alan king's daughter married Aaron's son Joseph. In \"Khazarian Hebrew Documents of the Tenth Century\", Omeljan Pritsak dated this war to the early reign of Romanos I (i.e., the early 920s CE).\n\n"}

The Supreme Court of Canada rejected the \"Charter\" challenge against a Quebec law excluding citizens under age 30 from receiving full social security benefits.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1989, a period of alarming and growing unemployment among young adults, under section 29(a) of the \"Social Aid Regulation\" (\"Règlement sur l’aide sociale\"), the Quebec government provided those who were single, unemployed and under 30 years old with $170 per month in social assistance, which amounted to only a third of the regular benefits. Full benefits were only available if the individuals would participate in one of three employability programs: On-the-job Training, Community Work or Remedial Education. The objective behind it was to encourage youth to find work or go to school. According to the Supreme Court of Canada, the new scheme was based on the philosophy that the most effective way to encourage and enable young people to join the workforce was to make increased benefits conditional on participating in one of three of the workfare programs.\n\nLouise Gosselin was under age 30 during the period from 1984 to 1989. She struggled with psychological problems and drug and alcohol addictions and attempted to work as a cook, waitress, seller and nurses' assistant, among many other jobs. She was homeless periodically, lived in an unheated apartment for one winter, and when she rented a room at a boarding house, she was left with no money for food.\n\nGosselin brought a class action on behalf of 75,000 individuals against the Quebec government for violation of her section 15 equality rights and Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms right to life, liberty and security of the person. As well, she claimed that her social rights in section 45 of the \"Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" were violated.\n\nThe Québec Court of Appeal was divided but ruled that the regulation did not violate the Canadian or Quebec \"Charter\". Two judges found a violation of section 15 of the Canadian \"Charter\", but only one found that it could not be saved by section 1. Another dissenting judge found a violation of section 45 of the Quebec \"Charter\".\n\nThe Supreme Court decided by 5–4 that there was no violation of section 15; by 7–2 that there was no violation of section 7; and by 6–1 that there was no violation of section 45 of the \"Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" (two justices ruled that section 45 was unenforceable in this situation). The majority opinion was written by McLachlin CJ.\n\nMcLachlin, with Gonthier, Iacobucci, Major, and Binnie JJ concurring, found there was not violation of section 15.\n\nIn applying the analytical framework for section 15 from \"Law v Canada\", McLachlin identified the government purpose was to promote short-terms autonomy among youth. The government was attempting to create an incentive for young people to participate in employment programs.\n\nMcLachlin rejected the claim that the purpose \"did not correspond to the actual needs and circumstances of the individuals\" and that it effectively stereotyped youth. Rather it was \"an affirmation of their potential\". The majority found that youth do not suffer from any pre-existing disadvantage and were not more susceptible to negative preconceptions.\n\nMcLachlin found that there was not enough evidence of harmful effects of the law. Rather, the claimants were merely representative of some individuals who had \"fallen through the cracks\".\n\nFurthermore, the majority found there was no evidence to show that those who wanted to participate in the employment programs were refused participation. Thus, there could be no finding of discrimination by adverse effects.\n\nMcLachlin, with Gonthier, Iacobucci, Major, Binnie and LeBel JJ concurring, found that there was no violation of section 7.\n\nThe primary reason for McLachlin's finding that there was no violation was because Gosselin was unable to discharge her legal burden of proof.\n\nIn examination of section 7, McLachlin also found that there was not enough evidence here either:\n\nArbour JJ held in dissent that section 7 places positive obligations on the government.\n\nBastarache wrote the dissenting opinion on section 15 with L'Heureux-Dubé, Arbour and LeBel JJ concurring for the most part.\n\nIn Bastarache's opinion, when he considered the existence of any pre-existing disadvantages, he claims McLachlin's assumption that persons under 30 have an easier time finding work was a stereotype that young welfare recipients do not suffer any special disadvantages, as none of the facts suggests any such conclusion. He concedes that there is no evidence that youth are more disadvantaged than other welfare recipients, but the marginalized state of all welfare recipients warrants giving them extra consideration.\n\nWhen examining the correspondence between the treatment of the claimant and her actual needs, Bastarache noted that law can differentiate only between groups when there is a genuine difference. On the facts, he saw no evidence of any real difference. He rejected the assumption that youth receive help from their families more than older people and found there is not enough difference to warrant reducing funding to create such substandard living conditions. That unjustified detriment alone should be sufficient to find a violation of section 15. He further rejected the suggestion that the government's good intention (it was \"for their own good\") should have any bearing on the reasoning despite McLachlin's claim otherwise. Such reasoning should be left to section 1 analysis.\n\nBastarache further took issue with the government's attempt to provide employment programs, as so few were able to stay in the program to receive full benefits. Less that 11% of youth on social assistance were in the program at any one time. Inevitably, all youth were forced to live on the third benefit for at least some period of time. It was because all youth suffered in such a precarious position that their dignity was harmed and equality rights violated.\n\nIn considering whether the violation could be saved under section 1, Bastarache acknowledged the need to give the government deference however, the government failed to show that the legislation was minimally impairing of the claimant's rights. There were many reasonable alternatives available that would not have caused as much harm to persons under 30. For example, there was no evidence that increased funding would have foiled the government's objective. Furthermore, Bastarache noted many flaws in the program's execution that resulted in significant harm.\n\nJustice Bastarache concurred with the majority finding that the law did not violate section 7 but offered a different reason for why that was the case:\n\n\n"}

She dominated American women's tennis before World War I, and won 45 U.S. titles during her life.\n\nWightman was born Hazel Virginia Hotchkiss in Healdsburg, California to William Joseph and Emma Lucretia (Grove) Hotchkiss. In February 1912, at the age of 25, she married George William Wightman of Boston. Her father-in-law, George Henry Wightman, was a leader in the steel industry, as an associate of Andrew Carnegie, and one of the country's foremost pioneers of amateur tennis.\n\nShe became a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma at the University of California-Berkeley and served as the chapter's president.\n\nWightman was the mother of five children. She died at her home in the village of Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts on December 5, 1974.\n\nIn 1973, Queen Elizabeth II made her an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nWightman dominated American women's tennis before World War I and had an unparalleled reputation for sportsmanship. Wightman won a lifetime total of 45 U.S. titles, the last at age 68. She won 16 titles overall at the U.S. Championships, four of them in singles (1909–11, 1919). Nine of her titles at the U.S. Championships came from 1909 to 1911, when she swept the singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles competitions three consecutive years.\n\nWightman is known as the \"Queen Mother of American Tennis\" or \"Lady Tennis\" for her lifelong participation in and promotion of women's tennis and because she was instrumental in organizing the Ladies International Tennis Challenge between British and American women's teams, better known as the Wightman Cup. The cup first was held in 1923 and continued through 1989. She played five years on the American team and was the captain of the American team from inception of the competition through 1948. The cup was composed of five singles and two doubles matches. The cup itself was donated in 1923 by Wightman in honor of her husband. The first contest at Forest Hills, New York on August 11 and 13, 1923 was won by the United States.\n\nBorn during the early days of American tennis, Wightman was a frail and awkward child. Her doctor recommended that she take up a sport to strengthen herself. Her brother suggested tennis as it was considered a \"genteel\" sport. Wightman learned to play at the nearby courts of the University of California, Berkeley where she graduated in 1911. Her rivalry with fellow Californian, May Sutton, shaped a new women's game, with Wightman attacking the net to counter Sutton's dominating forehand.\n\nWightman devoted herself to teaching young people, opening her home near Boston's Longwood Cricket Club to aspiring champions. In recognition of Wightman's contributions to tennis, the USTA Service Bowl was donated in her honor. In 1973, Wightman was appointed as an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire.\n\n\nThough short in stature, Wightman anticipated and moved extremely well around a tennis court. She perfected her volleying style early, hitting the ball against the family home in Berkeley, California, where she grew up and graduated from the University of California. She refused to let the ball bounce because the yard was so uneven. She used to play against her four brothers and then the proud and spiky Sutton sisters.\n\nWightman was a shy, somewhat awed, and fascinated 22-year-old college girl when she arrived at the Philadelphia Cricket Club in 1909 for the U.S. Championships. She never before played on grass, but she used her attacking style and rock-ribbed volleying—she was the first woman to rely so heavily on the volley—to win the all-comers final over Louise Hammond 6–8, 6–1, 6–4 and then the title over 39-year-old Maud Barger-Wallach 6–0, 6–1. Wightman also won the women's doubles and mixed doubles titles that year.\n\nIn the 1910 Washington State Championships, Wightman won one of the few recorded \"Golden Matches\" in which the winner did not lose a point. She defeated a Miss Huiskamp (first name unknown).\n\nWightman successfully defended all three titles at the U.S. Championships in 1910 and 1911. Wightman easily defeated Hammond in the 1910 singles final. May Sutton, an old West Coast rival and singles titlist at the U.S. Championships in 1904, pushed Wightman hard in the 1911 singles final before Wightman prevailed 8–10, 6–4, 9–7.\n\nThe most remarkable comeback in Wightman's career came at the singles final of the 1911 Niagara International Tennis Tournament against Sutton. After losing the first set 0–6 and going down 1–5 in the second, she won 12 straight games and the title 0–6, 7–5, 6–0.\n\nIn 1912, Wightman married Bostonian George Wightman and did not defend her U.S. titles. However, responding to a challenge from her father to win after becoming a mother, which would be a U.S. first, she played again in 1915, losing the singles final to Molla Bjurstedt Mallory but winning the women's doubles and mixed doubles titles. At age 32, she won her fourth singles title with the loss of only one set, beating Marion Zinderstein 6–1, 6–2 in the final. She also reached the women's doubles final. Thereafter, her success (U.S. adult titles between 1909 and 1943) was limited to doubles.\n\nWightman envisioned a team tournament for women similar to the Davis Cup and offered a silver vase as prize. In 1923, the British and Americans had the strongest women players. So, Julian Myrick of the United States Lawn Tennis Association decided that a U.S.-Britain competition would be in order for the Wightman Cup. The event, with Wightman captaining and playing for a winning U.S. side, opened the newly constructed stadium at Forest Hills, New York. A treasured series, it lasted through 1989, disbanding when the event was no longer competitive.\n\nWightman, devoted to the game in all aspects, generously instructed innumerable players at no charge throughout her life. She also teamed with two of her protégées who later joined her in the International Tennis Hall of Fame to win important titles: Wimbledon, U.S., and Olympic doubles titles with Helen Wills Moody in 1924 and U.S. Indoor women's doubles titles with Sarah Palfrey Cooke from 1928 through 1931. Her second Olympic gold medal in 1924 came in mixed doubles with Dick Williams.\n\nThe last of Wightman's record 34 U.S. adult titles was recorded in 1943 as she, 56, and Pauline Betz Addie won the women's doubles title at the U.S. Indoor Championships over Lillian Lopaus and Judy Atterbury, 7–5, 6–1.\n\nWightman was included in the year-end top 10 rankings issued by the United States Lawn Tennis Association in 1915, 1918, and 1919 and was the top ranked U.S. player in 1919 (rankings began in 1913).\n\n\nThrough 1923, the French Championships were open only to French nationals. The World Hard Court Championships (WHCC), actually played on clay in Paris or Brussels, began in 1912 and were open to all nationalities. The results from that tournament are shown here from 1912 through 1914 and from 1920 through 1923. The Olympics replaced the WHCC in 1924, as the Olympics were held in Paris. Beginning in 1925, the French Championships were open to all nationalities, with the results shown here beginning with that year.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2128300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2128300", "title": "Cascade reaction", "text": "Cascade reaction\n\nA cascade reaction, also known as a domino reaction or tandem reaction, is a chemical process that comprises at least two consecutive reactions such that each subsequent reaction occurs only in virtue of the chemical functionality formed in the previous step. In cascade reactions, isolation of intermediates is not required, as each reaction composing the sequence occurs spontaneously. In the strictest definition of the term, the reaction conditions do not change among the consecutive steps of a cascade and no new reagents are added after the initial step. By contrast, one-pot procedures similarly allow at least two reactions to be carried out consecutively without any isolation of intermediates, but do not preclude the addition of new reagents or the change of conditions after the first reaction. Thus, any cascade reaction is also a one-pot procedure, while the reverse does not hold true. Although often composed solely of intramolecular transformations, cascade reactions can also occur intermolecularly, in which case they also fall under the category of multicomponent reactions.\n\nThe main benefits of cascade sequences include high atom economy and reduction of waste generated by the several chemical processes, as well as of the time and work required to carry them out. The efficiency and utility of a cascade reaction can be measured in terms of the number of bonds formed in the overall sequence, the degree of increase in the structural complexity via the process, and its applicability to broader classes of substrates.\n\nThe earliest example of a cascade reaction is arguably the synthesis of tropinone reported in 1917 by Robinson. Since then, the use of cascade reactions has proliferated in the area of total synthesis. Similarly, the development of cascade-driven organic methodology has also grown tremendously. This increased interest in cascade sequences is reflected by the numerous relevant review articles published in the past couple of decades. A growing area of focus is the development of asymmetric catalysis of cascade processes by employing chiral organocatalysts or chiral transition-metal complexes.\n\nClassification\nof cascade reactions is sometimes difficult due to the diverse nature of the many\nsteps in the transformation. K. C. Nicolaou labels the cascades as\nnucleophilic/electrophilic, radical, pericyclic or transition-metal-catalyzed,\nbased on the mechanism of the steps involved. In the cases in which two or more\nclasses of reaction are included in a cascade, the distinction becomes rather\narbitrary and the process is labeled according to what can be arguably\nconsidered the “major theme”. In order to highlight the remarkable\nsynthetic utility of cascade reactions, the majority of the examples below come\nfrom the total syntheses of complex molecules.\n\nNucleophilic/electrophilic cascades are\ndefined as the cascade sequences in which the key step constitutes a nucleophilic\nor electrophilic attack.\n\nAn example of such a cascade is seen in the short enantioselective synthesis of the broad-spectrum antibiotic (–)-chloramphenicol, reported by Rao et al. (Scheme 1). Herein, the chiral epoxy-alcohol 1 was first treated with dichloroacetonitrile in the presence of NaH. The resulting intermediate 2 then underwent a BF·EtO-mediated cascade reaction. Intramolecular opening of the epoxide ring yielded intermediate 3, which, after an \"in situ\" hydrolysis facilitated by excess BF·EtO, afforded (–)-chloramphenicol (4) in 71% overall yield.\nA nucleophilic cascade was also employed in the total synthesis of the natural product pentalenene (Scheme 2). In this procedure, squarate ester 5 was treated with (5-methylcyclopent-1-en-1-yl)lithium and propynyllithium. The two nucleophilic attacks occurred predominantly with \"trans\" addition to afford intermediate 6, which spontaneously underwent a 4π-conrotatory electrocyclic opening of the cyclobutene ring. The resulting conjugated species 7 equilibrated to conformer 8, which more readily underwent an 8π-conrotatory electrocyclization to the highly strained intermediate 9. The potential to release strain directed protonation of 9 such that species 10 was obtained selectively. The cascade was completed by an intramolecular aldol condensation that afforded product 11 in 76% overall yield. Further elaboration afforded the target (±)-pentalenene (12).\nA subcategory of nucleophilic/electrophilic sequences is constituted by organocatalytic\ncascades, in which the key nucleophilic attack is driven by organocatalysis.\n\nAn organocatalytic cascade was employed in the total synthesis of the natural product harziphilone, reported by Sorensen et al. in 2004 (Scheme 3). Herein, treatment of the enone starting material 13 with organocatalyst 14 yielded intermediate 15 via conjugate addition. Subsequent cyclization by the intramolecular Michael addition of the enolate into the triple bond of the system gave species 16, which afforded intermediate 17 after proton transfer and tautomerization. The cascade was completed by elimination of the organocatalyst and a spontaneous 6π-electrocyclic ring closure of the resultant \"cis\"-dienone 18 to (+)-harziphilone (19) in 70% overall yield.\nAn outstanding triple organocatalytic cascade was reported by Raabe et\nal. in 2006. Linear aldehydes (20),\nnitroalkenes (21) and \"α\",\"β\"-unsaturated\naldehydes (22) could be condensed\ntogether organocatalytically to afford \"tetra\"-substituted\ncyclohexane carbaldehydes (24) with\nmoderate to excellent diastereoselectivity and complete enantiocontrol (Scheme\n4). The transformation is mediated by the readily\navailable proline-derived organocatalyst 23.\n\nThe transformation was proposed to\nproceed via a Michael addition/Michael addition/aldol condensation sequence\n(Scheme 5). In the first step, Michael addition of\naldehyde 20 to nitroalkene 21 occurs through enamine catalysis,\nyielding nitroalkane 25. Condensation\nof \"α\",\"β\"-unsaturated aldehyde 22 with the organocatalyst then\nfacilitates the conjugate addition of 25\nto give intermediate enamine 26,\nwhich is prone to undergo an intramolecular aldol condensation to iminium\nspecies 27. Organocatalyst 23 is regenerated by hydrolysis, along\nwith the product 24, thus closing\nthe triple cascade cycle.\n\nRadical cascades are those in which the\nkey step constitutes a radical reaction. The high reactivity of free radical\nspecies renders radical-based synthetic approaches decidedly suitable for\ncascade reactions.\n\nOne of the most widely recognized\nexamples of the synthetic utility of radical cascades is the cyclization\nsequence employed in the total synthesis of (±)-hirsutene, in 1985 (Scheme 6). Herein, alkyl iodide 28 was converted to the primary radical\nintermediate 29, which underwent a 5-\"exo\"-trig cyclization to afford reactive species 30. A subsequent 5-\"exo\"-dig radical cyclization lead to intermediate 31, which upon quenching gave the\ntarget (±)-hirsutene (32) in 80%\noverall yield.\n\nA cascade radical process was also\nused in one of the total syntheses of (–)-morphine (Scheme 7). Aryl bromide 33 was converted to the corresponding\nradical species 34 by treatment with\ntri-\"n\"-butyltin hydride. A 5-\"exo\"-trig cyclization then occurred to\ngive intermediate 35\nstereoselectively in virtue of the stereochemistry of the ether linkage. In the\nnext step of the cascade, the geometric constraints of 35 forbid the kinetically favored 5-\"exo\"-trig cyclization pathway; instead secondary benzylic radical\nspecies 36 was obtained via a\ngeometrically-allowed 6-\"endo\"-trig\ncyclization. Subsequent elimination of the phenyl sulfinyl radical afforded\nproduct 37 in 30% overall yield,\nwhich was further elaborated to (–)-morphine (38).\n\nPossibly the most widely encountered\nkind of process in cascade transformations, pericyclic reactions include\ncycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions and sigmatropic rearrangements. Although some of the abovementioned\ninstances of nucleophilic/electrophilic and radical cascades involved\npericyclic processes, this section contains only cascade sequences that are\nsolely composed of pericyclic reactions or in which such a reaction arguably\nconstitutes the key step.\n\nA representative example of a pericyclic cascade is the endiandric acid cascade\nreported by Nicolaou et al. in 1982 (Scheme 8). Herein the highly unsaturated system 39 was first hydrogenated to the\nconjugated tetraene species 40,\nwhich upon heating underwent an 8π-conrotatory\nelectrocyclic ring closure, yielding cyclic intermediate 41. A second spontaneous electrocyclization, this time a\n6π-disrotatory ring closure, converted 41\nto the bicyclic species 42, the\ngeometry and stereochemistry of which favored a subsequent intramolecular\nDiels-Alder reaction. The methyl ester of endiandric acid B (43) was thus obtained in 23% overall\nyield.\n\nA pericyclic sequence involving intramolecular\nhetero-cycloaddition reactions was employed in the total synthesis of naturally\noccurring alkaloid (–)-vindorosine (Scheme 9). Rapid access to the\ntarget was achieved from a solution of 1,3,4-oxadiazole 44 in triisopropyl benzene subjected to high temperatures and\nreduced pressure. First an inverse-electron-demand hetero-Diels-Alder reaction\noccurred to give intermediate 45.\nThermodynamically favorable loss of nitrogen generated the\n1,3-dipole-containing species 46. A\nspontaneous intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of the 1,3-dipole and the indole\nsystem then formed the \"endo\"-product 47 in 78% overall yield. Further\nelaboration yielded the target natural product 48. \n\nThe total synthesis of (–)-colombiasin A reported in 2005\nby the Harrowven group included an electrocyclic cascade (Scheme 10). When subjected to heat via microwave\nirradiation, squarate derivative 49\nunderwent an electrocyclic opening of the cyclobutene ring, followed by a\n6π-electrocyclic ring closure that yielded bicyclic intermediate 51. Tautomerization thereof gave the\naromatic species 52, which upon\nexposure to air was oxidized to product 53\nin 80% overall yield. The target (–)-colombiasin A (54) was then obtained from 53\nvia a heat-facilitated Diels-Alder reaction\nfollowed by cleavage of the \"tert\"-butyl\nprotecting group.\n\nCertain [2,2]paracyclophanes can also be obtained via\npericyclic cascades, as reported by the Hopf group in 1981 (Scheme 11). In this sequence, a Diels-Alder\nreaction between 1,2,4,5-hexatetraene 55\nand dienophile 56 first formed the highly reactive\nintermediate 57, which subsequently dimerized\nto yield [2,2]paracyclophane 58.\n\nTransition-metal-catalyzed\ncascade sequences combine the novelty and power of organometallic chemistry\nwith the synthetic utility and economy of cascade reactions, providing an even\nmore ecologically and economically desirable approach to organic synthesis.\n\nFor instance, rhodium catalysis was used to convert acyclic monoterpenes of the\ntype 59 to 4\"H\"-chromen products in a hydroformylation cascade (Scheme 12). First, selective rhodium-catalyzed\nhydroformylation of the less sterically hindered olefin bond in 59 yielded unsaturated aldehyde 60, which under the same conditions was\nthen converted to intermediate 61\nvia a carbonyl-ene reaction. A second rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation to\nspecies 62 was followed by\ncondensation to form 4\"H\"-chromen\nproducts of the type 63 in 40%\noverall yield. \n\nRhodium catalysis was also employed to initiate a cyclization/cycloaddition cascade in\nthe synthesis of a tigliane reported by the Dauben group (Scheme 13). Treatment of diazoimide 64 with rhodium(II) acetate dimer generated\na carbenoid that yielded reactive ylide 65\nafter an intramolecular cyclization with the neighboring carbonyl group. An\nintramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition then spontaneously occurred to afford the\ntarget tigliane 66.\n\nThe formal intramolecular [4+2]\ncycloaddition of 1,6-enynes of the type 67\nmediated by gold catalysis is another example of a transition-metal-catalyzed\ncascade (Scheme 14). A variety of\n1,6-enynes reacted under mild conditions in the presence of Au(I) complexes 68a–b to yield the tricyclic products 69 in moderate to excellent yields.\n\nThis formal cycloaddition was proposed\nto proceed via the cascade process shown in Scheme 15. Complexation of the 1,6-enyne\n67 with the cationic form of the\ncatalyst yields intermediate 70, in\nwhich the activated triple bond is attacked by the olefin functionality to\nyield substituted cyclopropane 71. Electrophilic\nopening of the three-membered ring forms cationic species 72, which undergoes a Friedel-Crafts-type reaction and then\nrearomatizes to give tricyclic product 69. Due to the nature of\nthe interaction of gold complexes with unsaturated systems, this process could\nalso be considered an electrophilic cascade.\n\nAn example of palladium-catalyzed\ncascades is represented by the asymmetric polyene Heck cyclization used in the preparation\nof (+)-xestoquinone from triflate substrate 75 (Scheme 16). Oxidative addition of the aryl–triflate bond\ninto the palladium(0) complex in the presence of chiral diphosphine ligand (\"S\")-binap yields chiral palladium(II)\ncomplex 77. This step is followed by\nthe dissociation of the triflate anion, association of the neighboring olefin\nand 1,2-insertion of the naphthyl group into the olefin to yield intermediate 79. A second migratory insertion into\nthe remaining olefin group followed by a \"β\"-elimination\nthen occurs to afford product 81 in\n82% overall yield and with moderate enantioselectivity. The palladium(0)\ncatalyst is also regenerated in this step, thus allowing the cascade to be reinitiated.\n\nMultistep tandem reactions (or cascade reactions) are a sequence of chemical transformations (usually more than two steps) that happens consecutively to convert a starting material to a complex product. This kind of organic reactions are designed to construct difficult structures encountered in natural product total synthesis.\n\nIn the total synthesis of spiroketal ionophore antibiotic routiennocin 1 (Fig. 1), the central spiroketal skeleton was constructed by a multistep tandem reaction (Fig. 2). Fragment A and fragment B were coupled in a single step to form the key intermediate G that could be further elaborated to afford the final product routiennocin.\n\nFour chemical transformations happened in this tandem reaction. First, treating fragment A with n-butyllithium formed carbon anion that attacked the alkyliodide part of fragment B to generate intermediate C (step 1). Then a 3, 4-dihydropyran derivative D was formed through base-mediated elimination reaction on intermediate C (step 2). The protecting group on 1, 3-diol moiety in intermediate D was removed by acid treatment to give the diol product E (step 3). The spiroketal product G was generated via intramolecular ketal formation reaction. This multistep tandem reaction greatly simplified the construction of this complex spiroketal structure and eased the path towards the total synthesis of routiennocin.\n\n"}

{"id": "2128305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2128305", "title": "Quinazoline", "text": "Quinazoline\n\nQuinazoline is an organic compound with the formula CHN. It is an aromatic heterocycle with a bicyclic structure consisting of two fused six-membered aromatic rings, a benzene ring and a pyrimidine ring. It is a light yellow crystalline solid that is soluble in water. Also known as 1,3-diazanaphthalene, quinazoline received its name from being an aza derivative of quinoline. Though the parent quinazoline molecule is rarely mentioned by itself in technical literature, substituted derivatives have been synthesized for medicinal purposes such as antimalarial and anticancer agents. Quinazoline is a planar molecule. It is isomeric with the other diazanaphthalenes of the benzodiazine subgroup: cinnoline, quinoxaline, and phthalazine. Over 200 biologically active quinazoline and quinoline alkaloids are identified.\n\nThe first known synthesis of quinazoline was reported in 1895 by August Bischler and Lang through the decarboxylation of the 2-carboxy derivative (quinazoline-2-carboxylic acid). In 1903, Siegmund Gabriel reported the synthesis of the parent quinazoline from \"o\"-nitrobenzylamine, which was reduced with hydrogen iodide and red phosphorus to 2-aminobenzylamine. The reduced intermediate condenses with formic acid to yield dihydroquinazoline, which was oxidized to quinazoline.\n\nQuinazoline hydrolyzes under acidic and alkaline conditions to 2-aminobenzaldehyde and formic acid and ammonia/ammonium.\n\nThe pyrimidine ring resists electrophilic substitution, although the 4-position is more reactive than the 2-position. In comparison, the benzene ring is more susceptible to electrophilic substitution. The ring position order of reactivity is 8 > 6 > 5 > 7. 2- and 4-halo derivatives of quinazoline undergo displacement by nucleophiles, such as piperidine.\n\nIn May 2003, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a quinazoline-containing drug gefitinib. The drug, produced by AstraZeneca, is an inhibitor of the protein kinase of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It binds to the ATP-binding site of EGFR, thus inactivating the anti-apoptotic Ras signal transduction cascade preventing further growth of cancer cells.\n\nIn March 2007, GlaxoSmithKline's drug lapatinib was approved by the U.S. FDA to treat advanced-stage or metastatic breast cancer in combination with Roche's capecitabine. Lapatinib eliminates the growth of breast cancer stem cells that cause tumor growth. The binding of lapatinib to the ATP-binding site in the EGFR and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein kinase domains inhibits signal mechanism activation (through reversible, competitive inhibition).\n\nIn May 2013, erlotinib, a drug manufactured by Astellas, was approved by the U.S. FDA to treat NSCLC patients with tumors caused by mutations of EGFR. The binding of erlotinib to the ATP-binding sites of the EGFR receptors prevents EGFR from producing phosphotyrosine residues (due to competitive inhibition), thus rendering the receptor incapable of generating signal cascades to promote cell growth.\n\nIn July 2013, the U.S. FDA approved afatinib, a drug developed by Boehringer Ingelheim, as an irreversible, competitive inhibitor of HER2 and EGFR kinases. While afatinib demonstrates a similar mechanism to laptinib in which it acts as an irreversible HER2 and EGFR inhibitor, afatinib has also shown activity against tyrosine kinases that have become resistant to gefinitib and erlotinib.\n"}

It is the seat of the Municipality of Sežana. Sežana is located on the Karst Plateau, from Trieste, Italy, and from Ljubljana, the capital city of Slovenia.\n\nSežana was attested in written sources in 1152 as \"in Cesan\" (and as \"Ses(s)ana\" in 1293 and \"Sexana\" in 1442). The name is of unclear origin. The early transcriptions do not support a connection with Saint Susanna or with the Friulian toponym \"Susáns\". The presumed suffix \"-ana\" would indicate a Romance origin, making possible a derivation from the Latin personal name \"Sessius\". Another possibility is derivation from the estate name \"*Sextiānum\", and a Lombard origin of the name has also been suggested. In the 19th century the names \"Sessana\" and \"Sehsana\" were in official use.\n\nUntil 1918, the town was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 11 \"Bezirkshauptmannschaften\" in the Austrian Littoral province.\n\nSežana remained a small and rather insignificant village until the mid-19th century, when the Austrian Southern Railway Company build Austrian Southern Railway, connecting Vienna to Trieste, next to it. Sežana thus became connected to major traffic and soon emerged as the most important center on the Karst Plateau, together with Opicina. After 1918, it was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy and included in the Province of Trieste. During the Fascist period, the population was subjected to a violent Italianization policy, and many locals joined the militant anti-fascist organization TIGR. During World War II, especially after 1943, the area became a battlefield between the Partisan resistance and the Fascist and Nazi German forces. In May 1945, Sežana was liberated by the Yugoslav Partisans. Between June 1945 and September 1947, it was administered by the British and U.S. Army. In 1947, it became part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and in 1991 of independent Slovenia.\n\nThe Sežana railway station was opened in 1857, and forms part of the Vienna–Trieste railway. Since 1947, it has been that railway's border crossing point between Yugoslavia/Slovenia and Italy.\n\nMany industrial enterprises are located in Sežana, including larger companies as well as many smaller enterprises.

{"id": "2128320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2128320", "title": "Springfield Union Station (Massachusetts)", "text": "Springfield Union Station (Massachusetts)\n\nSpringfield Union Station is a train and bus station in the Metro Center area of Springfield, Massachusetts. Constructed in 1926, Springfield Union Station is the fifth busiest Amtrak station in the Commonwealth.\n\nA large-scale $94 million renovation project restored the former station building, and it reopened in late June 2017 as a regional intermodal transit hub. It features not only Amtrak service, but also serves as the new hub for the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA), along with Peter Pan Bus Lines, Greyhound Lines, and the Hartford Line commuter rail. PVTA and intercity bus services began using the renovated station in 2017, and the Hartford Line opened in June 2018. Amtrak moved from a 1994-built structure to the renovated station in June 2019.\n\nSpringfield's grand Union Station was constructed in 1926 by the Boston & Albany Railroad to replace an earlier Richardson Romanesque unique dual-station by Shepley Rutan and Coolidge, the successor firm to that of noted American architect, H. H. Richardson (architect of Trinity Church in Copley Square, Boston). Prior to that, an Egyptian Revival structure served the city until the first so-called Union Station was built in 1851.\n\nThe 1926 station was built for $5.87 million. The station opened to the public on December 18, 1926.\n\nSpringfield is exactly equidistant to both Boston and Albany at from each. The New York, New Haven & Hartford (including the Central New England Railway) and Boston & Maine railroads also utilized the station.\n\nAlready in the 1950s, the New York Central Railroad, the parent company of the Boston & Albany, wanted to sell the grand Springfield station, calling it \"a white elephant\". The opening of the Massachusetts Turnpike in 1958 was said to have caused a 50% decline in passenger trips to Boston. By 1962, train departures had fallen from a 1920s-30s peak of 97 per day to fewer than 15 per day. The station was sold in 1970 to David Buntzman, a real estate speculator from Larchmont, New York.\n\nThe 1926 main station building and baggage building closed in 1973 as passenger traffic could no longer justify the 221,000-square foot station and the Boston & Albany intercity routes were taken over by Amtrak. The building had been neglected for a number of years and was in poor condition, and the required rehabilitation to the building was deemed too costly. After this, Amtrak opened a makeshift station at street level within the passenger tunnel, with the sole entrance being from Lyman Street. The connection from the tunnel to the old station was sealed.\n\nIn 1994, Amtrak constructed a station building at track level and sealed off the passenger tunnel except for the Lyman Street entrance and the southernmost stairway and elevator shaft to track level. A modern elevator was installed in the remaining open shaft to connect from street level to the new station building above.\n\nIn October 2008, the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority and the Springfield Redevelopment Authority released a redevelopment plan for Union Station. The plan, estimated to cost $65.2 million, called for restoring the 1926 Union Station Terminal building for reuse as an intermodal rail and bus station and fully building out the first floor and main concourse with rentable commercial space and ticketing and waiting areas for both rail and bus. The baggage/railway express building was to be demolished and baggage tunnel sealed. A parking garage and bus bays for both inter-city and regional bus services (which would replace the Peter L. Picknelly Transportation Center a block away) would go on the footprint of the former baggage building. Additionally the pedestrian tunnel to Lyman Street would be restored, and the platforms raised for handicapped accessibility. The final plan announced in December 2014, at a cost $75.7 million, additionally includes restoring and building out the upper floors of the 1926 station building to usable vacant \"shell space\". This would include only infrastructure and utility work on those floors, with final finishing work to be done by the eventual tenants based on their needs. This space is aimed for use by office or other commercial tenants. By the time the station opened, the full cost had risen to $94 million.\n\nDemolition of the baggage/railway express building began on December 1, 2014, and was completed in early 2015. The only remnant of the baggage facility is a tunnel under the rail viaduct that was used for freight and baggage transport between the warehouse and the trains above. The only remaining entrance to this tunnel is a set of doors along the retaining wall in the bus loading area at the location of where the tunnel formerly connected to the warehouse although it is off limits to the public. By February 2016 the parking garage had been assembled and restoration work on the station terminal building had begun, with new windows and roofing installed. The restoration was nearly complete in March 2017 when officials took journalists on a tour and the grand opening occurred on June 24, 2017.\nThe PVTA was the first transportation operator to use the renovated station; it began operations there on June 24, 2017, leasing 18 bus berths. Peter Pan and Greyhound buses began operating out of Union Station on September 6, 2017. The companies ended their revenue-sharing agreement and began operating competing services three weeks later. The CTrail Hartford Line commuter rail service began operating out of the renovated terminal in June 2018.\n\nAmtrak relocated ticketing and the passenger waiting area to the main concourse of Union Station in June 2019.\n\nThe new platform designated Platform C was installed with direct stairwell and elevator access to the passenger tunnel below. The design was finalized in March 2018. The platform design process had been delayed due to insufficient space between the stairwell head house and the platform edge and the Federal Railroad Administration denied a waiver from the clearance requirement and it originally was intended to be constructed during the revitalization of the historic station building itself. The project was awarded to a construction contractor in May 2018 and construction began in August 2018. The -long high-level Platform C opened on January 23, 2020, with a final cost of $10 million. Platform C retains some historic elements of the former low-level platform it replaced, including the existing overhead canopy steel structure.\n\nThe primary passenger rail service at Springfield Union Station are the trains connecting Springfield to the Amtrak's Northeast Corridor trains in New Haven. An additional 1–2 daily round trips start or terminate their service at Springfield.\n\nThe station is also served by the \"Vermonter\" and trains. The \"Vermonter\" currently uses the north-south Connecticut River Line to Connecticut and Vermont, while the \"Lake Shore Limited\" makes use of the east–west Boston Line platforms as it continues to and from Albany, New York.\n\nIn the past a single \"Northeast Regional\" round trip (usually trains 142 and 145) would travel between New Haven and Boston via the so-called \"Inland Route\" via Springfield and the Boston Line, as opposed to the faster, electrified Northeast Corridor. In 2003, a problem pulled the \"Acela Express\" trainsets out of service and in an effort to find substitute rolling stock, Amtrak first curtailed the inland round trip to a three-car shuttle between Boston and New Haven before canceling it completely. Today, all normally scheduled \"Regional\" trains using the Inland Route only use the portion between Springfield and New Haven; in the event of a service disruption on the Northeast Corridor, trains may be scheduled to run via the complete Inland Route. One such occasion was the replacement of the Thames River Bridge movable span in June 2008, when Amtrak scheduled three round trips per day over the Inland Route to substitute for the complete suspension of regular Northeast Corridor service.\n\nUnion Station serves as the region's bus hub. The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority, which operates local buses serving Springfield and surrounding towns and cities, occupies 18 bus berths at the station. Springfield-based Peter Pan Bus Lines uses seven bus berths for intercity buses, and Greyhound Lines uses the remaining two for its intercity service.\n\nSpringfield's renovated Union Station is the northern terminus for the Hartford Line, a commuter rail service which began operating out of Union Station on June 16, 2018. CTrail operated service uses the new Union Station facility for ticketing and waiting while Amtrak continues to operate out of the older station located trackside. On July 24, 2017 the Connecticut Department of Transportation announced that a joint partnership between TransitAmerica Services and Alternate Concepts Inc. was chosen as the operator for the new service. This partnership operates similar commuter services in other markets. Amtrak continues its present intercity service on the line and will continue to own and maintain the infrastructure on the rail line between New Haven and Springfield. The expanded service to Springfield Union Station from New Haven includes a total of seven additional roundtrips, four of which are commuter trains operated by the new CT\"rail\" operator, and the other three of which are additional Amtrak \"Shuttles\" which brings the service to eight Amtrak round trips and four CT\"rail\" round trips. On August 30, 2019, Amtrak extended two daily New Haven–Springfield Shuttle round trips (branded as \"Valley Flyer\") to Greenfield as a pilot program.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Transportation and the Vermont Agency of Transportation have completed a study to examine the opportunities and impacts of more frequent and higher speed intercity passenger rail service between Boston and Montreal. The Boston to Montreal corridor runs from Boston to Springfield Union Station. From Springfield, the rail corridor follows the route of the \"Vermonter\" northerly through , , and , Massachusetts, and , , (Burlington), and , Vermont. From St. Albans, the corridor continues to the Canada–US border and onward to Montreal Central Station in Quebec. This study has been designated the Northern New England Intercity Rail Initiative. This would mark the first Boston-Montreal rail service since the Boston & Maine discontinued the \"Alouette\" in 1965, which operated via a direct route through Concord, New Hampshire.\n\nThe Union Station building, bus bays, and parking garage are located on the north side of the rail viaduct adjacent to Frank B. Murray Street. The stairwells and elevators to the boarding platforms is located on the south side of the viaduct next to Lyman Street. A tunnel leads under the viaduct, allowing Union Station to be accessed from Lyman Street. The main hall in Union Station includes a waiting area for rail passengers, restaurants, retail spaces, and ticket windows for rail and intercity bus services; a PVTA local bus waiting area and an intercity bus waiting area are located in an adjacent room. Commercial space is located on the second and third floors.\n\nThe rail viaduct holds six tracks, which are numbered 1, 2, 2a, 4, 6, and 8 from north to south. Tracks 1 and 2 are primarily used by CSX Transportation for freight service on their Berkshire Subdivision and are served by platforms A and B - track 2 is also used for boarding and disembarking of the daily Lake Shore Limited train. Track 2a, which connects with both the New Haven-Springfield Line and the CSX tracks, is owned by Amtrak is used mainly for storing train equipment and is not normally used for boarding. Tracks 4 through 8 (serving platforms C and D) are currently used for most Amtrak service; they connect directly to the New Haven–Springfield Line west of the station, but only connect to the CSX tracks east of the station. (The \"Lake Shore Limited\" uses the CSX tracks for this reason.) West of the station, the New Haven–Springfield Line curves to the south while the Berkshire Subdivision continues on to cross the Connecticut River on a twin truss bridge. The Connecticut River Line connects to both lines west of the station, although it requires a backup move to reach tracks 4 though 8.\n\nThe four current platforms were once all island platforms, with stairways to the under-track tunnel and cargo elevators to a separate tunnel serving the baggage/railway express building. Platform C, between tracks 4 and 6, was demolished and rebuilt as a high-level boarding platform. Platform C is served by its own elevator and stairwell from the passenger tunnel. Platform D, which serves track 8 and is adjacent to the former 1994 station building, is accessed from the older elevator and stairwell closest to the Lyman Street entrance. Platform B/track 2 is accessed via a paved walkway from the west end of platform D that crosses tracks 2A, 4, 6, and 8. \n\nThe station offers a Commuter Variety newsstand that sells quick necessities, Dunkin' Donuts and Subway restaurants, and a Sixt car-rental.\n\nOn June 6, 2017, Dietz & Company Architects, the largest architecture firm in the region, announced they would be occupying approximately on the second floor.\n\nOn November 20, 2017, Peter Pan Bus Lines announced the signing of a lease for of office space at Union Station for the company's corporate headquarters. The company will occupy the entire third floor of the building.\n\n\n"}

Various sizes and shapes of chain and weight were used as there was no set rule on the construction of these weapons. Other popular names are \"manrikigusari\" (萬力鏈) (\"ten thousand power chain\") or just \"manriki\".\n\nTypically the length of the forged chain could vary from around 12 inches (30 cm) up to 48 inches (120 cm). The chain links could have many different shapes including round, elliptical, and egg-shaped. The thickness of the chain also varied. Usually the first link of chain attached to the weight was round and often larger and thicker than the rest of the links of the chain.\n\nThe weight attached to each end of the chain could have many different sizes and shapes. The weights were usually exactly matched in size and shape. On some of the related chain and weight weapons the weights could be completely different from each other, with one weight being much longer than the other like a handle on one end, or one weight could be round while the other weight could be rectangular. Weight shapes include round, hexagonal, or rectangular. The weight could be fairly light or quite heavy with the typical weight being from 2 ounces (56 grams) to 4 ounces (112 grams).\n\nThe use of the \"kusari-fundo\" was taught in several different schools, or \"ryū\" (流), as a hidden or concealed weapon and also as a self-defense weapon. The \"kusari-fundo\" was useful when carrying a sword was not allowed or impractical, and samurai police of the Edo period would often use a \"kusari-fundo\" as one of their non lethal arresting weapons.\n\nThere are several chain and weight weapons. One type known as a \"konpi\" is mentioned in manuscripts as far back as the \"Nanbokucho\" period (1336-1392).\n\nMasaki Tarodayu Dannoshin Toshiyoshi (1689-1776), founder of the \"Masaki ryū\", is said to have developed a version of the \"kusari-fundo\" while serving Lord Toda, as a bloodless weapon that could be used to defend the grounds of Edo castle.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the \"kusari-fundo\" (\"manrikigusari\") is classified as an illegal offensive weapon.\n\nIn the United States state of Massachusetts, carrying a manrikigusari in public is considered a felony.\n\n"}

It is located on the university's Whiteknights Campus in the town of Reading, Berkshire, England. \n\nThe collection was established in the early 20th century by Francis J. Cole (Professor of Zoology), Dr Nellie B. Eales (who catalogued the collection), and Mr Stoneman, from 1907 to 1939 when Cole retired. On Cole's death in 1959, the University also purchased his library of books, which are kept as a special collection in the main library.\n\nA refurbishment of the museum was completed on 17 March 2004, enlarging the floor area to display a wider sample of the entire collection. It contains about 4,000 specimens of which about 400 are on display at any one time. Specimens are arranged in 27 cases in taxonomic sequence, thus enabling a complete tour of the diversity of the animal kingdom. Specimens include a male Indian circus elephant skeleton, a 5-metre reticulated python skeleton containing 400 vertebrae, a fossil of the largest spider to ever have lived, and a false killer whale skeleton.\n\n\n"}

The lunar crater lies about one crater diameter to the north-northeast of crater Lemaître, a formation of similar dimension. To the northwest of Minkowski is the flooded crater Baldet, and to the southeast lies Fizeau.\n\nThe outer rim of Minkowski is heavily eroded, and forms little more than an irregular circular ridge in the surface. Numerous craters lie across the rim, the most prominent being two pairs along the eastern edge. The interior floor is relatively level, with a dark patch in the northeast quadrant that is characteristic of a lava-flooded surface. There is a small bowl-shaped crater located prominently at the midpoint. Minkowski S lies along the southwestern edge of the floor. A number of tiny craterlets mark the interior surface, particularly in the southwest quadrant.\n\nBy convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Minkowski.\n\n"}

It was initially titled Five Pictures of the Grand Canyon.\n\nIt consists of five movements, each an evocation in tone of a particular scene typical of the Grand Canyon. Paul Whiteman and his orchestra gave the first public performance of the work, in concert at the Studebaker Theatre in Chicago on November 22, 1931.\n\nThe movements of the suite are:\n\nI. Sunrise<br> II. Painted Desert<br> III. On the Trail<br> IV. Sunset<br> V. Cloudburst\n\n\"Grand Canyon\" is a 1958 short Walt Disney film in CinemaScope format directed by James Algar. It features color film footage of the Grand Canyon accompanied by the \"Grand Canyon Suite\", though the order of the movements has been somewhat altered. In the manner of \"Fantasia\", there is no story and no dialogue. The film won an Academy Award in 1959 for Best Short Subject.\n\n\"On The Trail\" has been used as the soundtrack for the Grand Canyon Diorama on the Santa Fe & Disneyland Railroad in Disneyland since the diorama's 1958 debut. \n\n\"On The Trail\" was the theme music for commercials for Philip Morris cigarettes on US radio and television from 1934 until sometime in the 1960s, accompanied by the voice of Johnny Roventini calling \"Call For Philip Morris\" in the style of a hotel bellhop paging a customer. This movement is also used extensively in the Bob Clark film \"A Christmas Story\", with the Celesta solo providing the soundtrack music when Ralphie and his younger brother are seen sleeping and dreaming about Christmas morning.\n\nPaul Whiteman and His Orchestra recorded the movements of the suite in three studio sessions on April 26, April 27, and April 28, 1932 for RCA Victor at their studios in Camden, New Jersey. The suite was released on eight 78 RPM record sides (eight single sided records/four two sided records) in 1932. The movements recorded were \"Sunrise\", \"Painted Desert\", \"On the Trail\", \"Sunset\", and \"Cloudburst\".\n\n"}

It was the seventh episode broadcast and aired on November 5, 1972 and repeated April 22, 1973. It was written by Burt Styler and directed by Bruce Bilson.\n\nGuest cast is Odessa Cleveland as Lt. Ginger Bayliss, Stuart Margolin as Captain Phillip G. Sherman and Marcia Strassman as Nurse Margie Cutler.\n\nEditor Fred W. Berger won an ACE Eddie Award from the American Cinema Editors organization (ACE) for his work on this episode.\n\nAfter an unusually long stretch in the OR, Hawkeye and Trapper argue, and decide that they need some R&R. Unfortunately, Henry is leaving for a few days, leaving Frank—who is unlikely to let them have R&R for any reason—in charge.\n\nHawkeye decides to pretend to be insane to try to get a few days off despite Frank's prejudice. He rejects a proposition from an attractive nurse, eats a plate of ostensibly human liver in full surgical garb, and reacts violently when Frank touches the plate. Trapper tells Frank that Hawkeye is losing it, and that he (Trapper) should take him to Tokyo for R&R. \n\nUncertain about whether they are serious or if it is an elaborate act, Margaret calls in a psychiatrist friend, Capt. Philip Sherman (Stuart Margolin), to assess Hawkeye's emotional state. After Hawkeye tells Sherman that he is in love with Frank, Sherman declares him to be insane. When Henry returns and learns of Sherman's finding, he argues that Hawkeye was merely trying to get R&R, but Sherman insists that Hawkeye needs to be committed to a hospital in Tokyo.\n\nHawkeye, upon hearing this, confesses he simply wanted a holiday from the war, but Sherman, who has designs on Margaret, insists that he be sent for treatment. Hawkeye concocts with Radar an elaborate plan to foil Sherman, Margaret and Frank's plan to get Hawkeye out of the unit. Radar talks to Sherman and plants ideas in his mind that Margaret, who has rebuffed all of Sherman's past advances, has the hots for him. Meanwhile, Trapper switches signs on Margaret's tent, leading Sherman to believe it is the VIP tent. After Sherman returns and settles in Margaret's cot, Trapper switches the signs back. When Margaret comes back and starts undressing, Sherman excitedly launches himself at her and drags her onto the cot. Margaret screams out and various members of the camp rush in, making it appear that Sherman was attempting to rape Margaret. Sherman flees the unit that night and Hawkeye is allowed to stay. He and Trapper are granted a week's R&R, but just as they are about to leave, a wave of fresh casualties ruins their plans. \n\nIn \"Watching M*A*S*H, Watching America\", a sociological examination of \"M*A*S*H\" as an illustration of shifting American values in the 1970s and early 1980s, James H. Wittebols cites Sherman's attempted assault on Margaret in this episode as an example of the program's questionable treatment of women in its early years. Wittebols also \nnotes the subplot of Hawkeye pretending to be in love with Frank (in order to convince Sherman that he is insane) as an example of the series' negative treatment of homosexuality.\n"}
